Lauri Törni

Lauri Allan Törni (28 May 1919 – 18 October 1965), later known as Larry Thorne, was a Finnish Army captain. He led an infantry company in the Finnish Winter and Continuation Wars. After the wars, he moved to the United States. He then joined the American Army. He is known as the soldier who fought under three flags: Finnish, German (when he fought the Soviets in World War II), and American (where he was known as Larry Thorne) when he served in U.S. Army Special Forces (Green Berets) in the Vietnam War.
Lauri Allan Törni was born in Viipuri, Viipuri Province, Karelia, Finland. His father was a ship captain named Jalmari (Ilmari) Törni. His mother was Rosa (née Kosonen) Törni. He had two sisters: Salme Lesley (b. 1920) and Kaija Iris (b. 1922). When he was a boy, he was athletic. An early friend was future Olympic Boxing Gold Medalist Sten Suvio. He attended business school and served with the Finland Civil Guard. Then he entered military service and joined the 4th Independent Jaeger Infantry Battalion stationed at Kiviniemi.
During the Winter War, he fought battles at Lake Ladoga. His courage was noticed by his commanders. At the end of the war, he received officer training. Then he was commissioned a Vänrikki (2nd lieutenant) in the reserves. After the Winter War, in June 1941, Törni went to Vienna, Austria. In Vienna, he received 7 weeks of training with the Waffen SS. Then he returned to Finland in July. Because he was a Finnish officer, he was recognized as a German Untersturmfuhrer.
Törni is famous because of his courage in the Continuation War (1941–44) between the Soviet Union and Finland. In 1943 he was the leader of "Detachment Törni". His infantry unit went behind enemy lines to attack the Russians. One of Törni's men was future President of Finland, Mauno Koivisto. The two served together during the Battle of Ilomantsi. This was the last Finnish-Soviet battle of the Continuation War.
Törni's unit caused many casualties on the Russian units. The Soviet Army placed a reward of 3 million Finnish Marks, equivalent to 650,000 USD, to anyone who captured Törni. Because of his courage, Törni was decorated with the Mannerheim Cross on 9 July 1944.
Törni was not happy when Finland made peace with the Soviets. The peace agreement required Finland to take up arms against Germany in the Lapland War. He left the Finnish Army. In 1945, he was recruited by a pro-German resistance movement in Finland. He traveled to Germany for saboteur training. He wanted to organize resistance in case Finland was occupied by the Soviet Union. He surrendered to British troops in Germany at the end of World War II. Then he returned to Finland in June 1945.
After he returned to Finland, he was arrested by ValPo, the Finnish national security agency. There was a trial for treason in 1946 because he had joined the German army. After the trial he received a 6 year sentence in January 1947. He went to prison in Turku, but he escaped in June. He was recaptured and went to a different prison. In December 1948, Finnish President Juho Paasikivi gave him a pardon.
In 1949 Törni, traveled with his wartime executive officer Holger Pitkänen to Sweden. They entered Sweden from Tornio to Haparanda (Haaparanta). From Haparanda they traveled by railroad to Stockholm. Törni stayed with the Baroness von Essen, who helped many Finnish officers following the war. Pitkänen was arrested and returned to Finland. Törni met and fell in love with a Swedish Finn, Marja Kops. They were engaged to be married. Looking for a new job before the marriage, Törni traveled to Caracas, Venezuela. Törni met one of his Winter War commanders, Finnish colonel Matti Aarnio, who lived in Venezuela. From Caracas, Törni hired on to a Swedish cargo ship, the "MS Skagen". The "Skagen" sailed to the United States in 1950. While in the Gulf of Mexico, near Mobile, Alabama, Törni jumped overboard and swam to shore. Now he was a political refugee. He traveled to New York City where he was helped by the Finnish-American community in the Sunset Park, Brooklyn "Finntown." There he worked as a carpenter and cleaner. In 1953, Törni received residence permit through an Act of Congress. The law firm of William J. "Wild Bill" Donovan (the former head of the OSS, America's wartime covert military organization) helped pass the law.
Törni joined the U.S. Army in 1954. The Lodge-Philbin Act was a special law that allowed non-citizens to join the army. He adopted the name Larry Thorne. While in the US Army, his friends were Finnish-American officers known as "Marttinen's Men." They helped Private Thorne join the Special Forces. While in the Special Forces, Thorne taught skiing, survival, mountaineering, and guerrilla tactics. In turn he attended airborne school. He advanced in rank and received a commission as a 2nd lieutenant in 1957. He was promoted to captain in 1960. From 1958 to 1962 he served in the 10th Special Forces Group in West Germany at Bad Tölz. While there he was second in command of a search and rescue mission in the Zagros mountains of Iran. The mission was very difficult and Thorne was praised because of its success.
In 1962 Thorne is shown as a lieutenant with the 10th Special Forces Group in a United States Army "The Big Picture" episode.
In November 1963 Thorne joined Special Forces unit A-734 in Vietnam. He fought in the Mekong Delta and received medals for bravery.
In 1965, Thorne transferred to Military Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observations Group (MACV–SOG). This was a classified U.S. special operations unit. The unit focused on unconventional warfare in Vietnam. On 18 October 1965, Thorne was supervising a secret mission on a helicopter. The helicopter crashed in a mountainous area of Vietnam, 25 miles (40 km) from Da Nang. A rescue team went to the crash site. They could not find it because of the mountains and trees.
Shortly after his disappearance, Thorne was promoted to the rank of major.
Thorne's body was found in 1999. Also, the bodies of the helicopter crew were found. The bodies were formally identified in 2003. On 26 June 2003, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, section 60, tombstone 8136. The remains of the Vietnam casualties were buried with him.
In the 1990s, Törni's name became more and more well-known as a martial war hero. Several books were written about him. He was named 52nd in the "Suuret Suomalaiset" listing of famous Finns. In the 2006 "" ("Finnish Soldier") magazine listing, he was named most courageous of the Mannerheim Cross recipients.
In Finland, the survivors, friends, and families of Detachment Törni formed the Lauri Törni Tradition Guild. The Infantry Museum (Jalkaväkimuseo) in Mikkeli, Finland, has an exhibit dedicated to Törni, as does the Military Museum of Finland in Helsinki. Törni is considered as the primary hero by both Finnish Parachute Rangers and Coastal Rangers, the two elite Finnish army formations.
At Fort Carson, Colorado, headquarters building for Special Forces is named the Larry Thorne Headquarters Building. The Special Forces 10th Group presents the Larry Thorne Award to the best Operational Detachment-Alpha in the command each year. The Special Forces Association Chapter 33 in Cleveland, Tennessee is named after him. In 2010 he was named as the first Honorary Member of the United States Army Special Forces Regiment.
In the book "The Green Berets" by Robin Moore, the "Sven Kornie" (or Captain Steve Kornie) main character in the first chapter was based on Thorne.
In a 2013 book "Tuntematon Lauri Törni" ["Unknown Lauri Törni"], Juha Pohjonen and Oula Silvennoinen say that Törni's conviction for treason was correct. They say the SS training that Törni received at the end of World War II was to support a National Socialist coup in Finland. Törni Heritage Guild members Markku Moberg and Pasi Niittymäki disagree. They say Törni faced pressure from war and alcohol, but did not support Germany. Finnish historian Jussi Niinistö says Törni's training was motivated by patriotism.

Eilmer of Malmesbury

Eilmer of Malmesbury was an English monk, born around 980. He is known for having attempted one of the first human flights in history.
The reason Eilmer made his flight was that he needed to think of a way out whenever the Vikings would attack the abbey. He went up a church tower with his gliding equipment that he had made from willow or ash. He made a downward flight of some 200 meters or so - from at least 18 meters high.

Bay of Pigs Invasion

The Bay of Pigs Invasion was an attempt in 1961 to remove Fidel Castro from power in Cuba. The CIA trained Cuban exiles and these exiles launched an attack in a bay called the Bay of Pigs. 
The invasion was a failure and most of the attackers were captured or killed. There were several conflicts that led to this; including a lack of promised air support and a change in where the landing was to be launched. This was one of many unsuccessful attempts by the CIA to rid Cuba of Castro. One interesting fact is that the plan was originally put in motion by Eisenhower, but the attack was ordered by John F. Kennedy who only found out about the plan after his election.

Data science

Data science is the study of the extraction of knowledge from data. It uses various techniques from many fields, including signal processing, mathematics, probability models, machine learning, computer programming, statistics, data engineering, pattern recognition and learning, visualization, uncertainty modeling, data warehousing, and high performance computing with the goal of extracting useful knowledge from the data. Data Science is not restricted to only big data, although the fact that data is scaling up makes big data an important aspect of data science.
A practitioner of data science is called a data scientist. Data scientists solve complex data problems using various elements of mathematics, statistics and computer science, although expertise in these subjects are not required. However, a data scientist is most likely to be an expert in only one or two of these disciplines, meaning that cross disciplinary teams can be a key component of data science.
Good data scientists are able to apply their skills to achieve a broad spectrum of end results. The skill-sets and competencies that data scientists employ vary widely.

<doc id="447850" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=447850" title="Pithovirus">
Pithovirus

Pithovirus is a genus of giant virus which infects amoebae. It is a double-stranded DNA virus, and is a member of the clade of large DNA viruses. It was first described in 2014 after a viable specimen was found in a 30,000-year-old ice core harvested from permafrost in Siberia, Russia.
It is 50% larger in size than the previous largest known viruses, but "Pandoravirus" has the largest viral genome, containing 1.9 to 2.5 megabases of DNA.
"Pithovirus" has a thick, oval wall with an opening at one end. Internally, its structure resembles a honeycomb.
The genome of "Pithovirus" has 467 different genes, more than a typical virus but far less than "Pandoravirus". Its genome is much less densely packed than any other known virus. Two-thirds of its proteins are unlike those of other viruses. Despite the physical similarity with "Pandoravirus", the "Pithovirus" genome sequence shows that it is barely related to that virus. It more closely resembles members of some other virus families. These families all contain large icosahedral viruses with DNA genomes. The "Pithovirus" genome has 36% GC-content, similar to the "Megaviridae", in contrast to greater than 61% for pandoraviruses.
The "Pithovirus"' genome is one circular, double stranded DNA (dsDNA) chromosome of about 610,000 base pairs (bp.) Its DNA translate into 467 different proteins. The genome encodes all the proteins needed to produce mRNA; these proteins are present in the purified virions. 
"Pithovirus" does its entire replication cycle in its host's cytoplasm, not the more typical method of taking over the host's nucleus.
"Pithovirus sibericum" was discovered in a 30,000-year-old sample of Siberian permafrost. The virus was discovered buried below the surface of a late Pleistocene sediment. It was found when riverbank samples collected in 2000 were exposed to amoebae. The amoebas started dying and were found to contain giant viruses. The authors said they got the idea to probe permafrost samples for new viruses after reading about an experiment that revived a similar aged seed two years earlier.
Although the virus is harmless to humans, its viability after being frozen for millennia raised concerns that global climate change and tundra drilling operations could lead to potentially dangerous viruses being unearthed. Other scientists deny that this poses a real threat.

Thanksgiving (United States)

Thanksgiving is a holiday celebrated once a year. It is a day to give thanks. It is always on the fourth Thursday of November.
English people often declared a "Thanksgiving" when something good happened. The London Company had a "day of Thanksgiving" at Berkeley Hundred, Virginia in 1619 to celebrate their new colony. 
In 1620 the "Mayflower" brought the Pilgrims to Massachusetts. They made their new home in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, 380 km northeast of what is now New York. 
Many of the Pilgrims died during their first winter in North America. They were cold and did not have enough food. The following year, though, the Native Americans, who were from the Wampanoag tribe, helped them grow crops. At harvest time in the winter of 1621, they were very thankful that they had a good crop of food to eat during the coming winter. They thanked God and the Native Americans for teaching them how to grow the local foods.
They invited three of the Wampanoags who had helped them to their feast. They were Squanto, Samoset, and Chief Massasoit. The Wampanoags brought their families. This was over 90 people. There were so many people that the Pilgrims did not have enough food to make the meal, so the Wampanoags brought along their own food for the feast.
The Wampanoags brought turkey, duck, fish, deer, berries, squash, and cornbread. They also brought vegetables that they had farmed and shown the Pilgrims how to care for.
In the United States, the Thanksgiving holiday is a four-day holiday over a weekend, starting on Thanksgiving Thursday and ending on Sunday. Families and friends usually eat a special meal together (usually with a turkey as the main dish). This meal also usually includes mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie, several casseroles, and stuffing. The food eaten today for Thanksgiving is very different from the food that was eaten at the First Thanksgiving in 1621.

Capsid

A capsid is the protein shell of a virus. It is made of several protein subunits. The observable 3-dimensional subunits are called 'capsomeres'. The capsid encloses the nucleic acid of the virus.
Capsids are broadly classified according to their structure. Some viruses, such as bacteriophages, have developed more complicated structures. The icosahedral shape, which has 20 equilateral triangular faces, approximates a sphere, while the helical shape is cylindrical. The capsid faces may consist of one or more proteins. For example, the foot-and-mouth disease virus capsid has faces consisting of three proteins called VP1–3.
Most viruses (e.g. influenza and many animal viruses) have viral envelopes covering their protein capsids. This means the capsid is coated with a lipid membrane. 
The envelope is got by the capsid from an intracellular membrane in the virus' host; such as the inner nuclear membrane, the golgi membrane, or the cell's outer membrane.
The envelope may help viruses avoid the host immune system. Glycoproteins on the surface of the envelope bind to receptor sites on the host's membrane. The viral envelope then fuses with the host's membrane This allows the capsid and viral genome to enter and infect the host.

Bobbie Rosenfeld

Fanny “Bobbie” Rosenfeld (December 28, 1904 — November 14, 1969) was a Canadian athlete in the 1920s. She competed in basketball, hockey, softball, speed skating, tennis, and track and field. During her career, she won two Olympic medals in track and field. She was also the Canadian record holder for the standing broad jump, running broad jump, and discus. 
In 1949, Rosenfeld was one of the first people to be given a place in the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame. In 1950, she was named Canada’s woman athlete of the first half-century (meaning 1900-1950) by the Canadian Press.
Fanny Rosenfeld was born on December 28, 1903 in Dnepropetrovsk, Russia. After Fanny’s birth, the Rosenfeld family moved to Barrie, Ontario. Rosenfeld’s athletic ability was first noticed during a 100-metre dash that she ran for fun in a small track and field meet in 1923. She came first in the race, beating Rosa Grosse, the Canadian champion.
Rosenfeld competed in the Olympics in Amsterdam in 1928. This was the first time that women were allowed to participate in track and field events at the Olympics. She was a member of the Matchless Six, the Canadian women’s track and field team. This team placed first in the 400-metre relay, won the gold medal and became national heroes. Rosenfeld also won the silver medal in the 100-metre dash and placed fifth in the 800-metre race.
Soon after the Amsterdam Olympics, Rosenfeld found out she had arthritis. This arthritis forced her to retire as an athlete in 1933, but she continued to be involved in sports as a coach and as a writer. In 1934, she coached the women’s track and field team for Canada. They competed at the British Commonwealth Games in London, England. 
Starting in 1937, she wrote “Sports Reel”, a newspaper column in the "Globe and Mail," a Canadian newspaper"." Through her writing, she continued to remind women that they were “people” and they could do anything they wanted, including sports. 
Rosenfeld died on November 13, 1969. She was 65 years old. Her contributions are remembered in a number of ways. 
The Bobbie Rosenfeld Trophy has given to a female athlete every year since 1978. In Israel, she was introduced into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1981. A park in downtown Toronto was named after her in 1991. In 1996, Canada Post honoured her with a stamp. The Jewish Women’s Archive in the United States named Rosenfeld a Woman of Valour for 2000.

Clidastes is an extinct genus of mosasaur from marine environments of the late Cretaceous. It was an agile and fast swimmer which cruised the surface or shallow waters hunting for prey.
"Clidastes" was one of the smallest of the mosasaurs, averaging in length, with the largest specimens reaching long. 
It had a delicate, slim form with an expansion near the tip of the tail. This enabled it to chase down the fastest of prey.

Nuclear membrane

The nuclear membrane is the membrane inside a cell around the nucleus. It has the genetic material (chromosomes and DNA) and the nucleolus inside it. The membrane forms a double layer called the nuclear envelope. It is connected to another group of membranes in the cell, the endoplasmic reticulum.
It is a double lipid bilayer membrane which surrounds the chromosomes and nucleolus in eukaryotic cells. 
The nuclear membrane has thousands of nuclear pores. They are large hollow proteins about 100 nm across, with an inner channel about 40 nm wide. They link the inner and outer nuclear membranes.
During cell division, the nuclear membrane breaks down to allow mitosis to take place.

Sir Bors the Younger is a fictional character in the King Arthur stories. He is one of the Knights of the Round Table. His father, Bors the Elder, was the King of Gaunnes. Bors the Younger and his brother, Lionel, rebelled against Claudas' court. Before they were captured by Claudas, the boys were rescued by one of the Lady of the Lake's servants. They, alongside Lancelot, grew up to become skilled knights. They then joined King Arthur's Round Table. Along with Galahad and Percival, Bors was one of the three to witness the wonders of the Holy Grail.
Bors is more known for his loyalty and faithfulness than his swordsmanship. Bors was always loyal to King Arthur, even if it meant risking his own life. Bors could be considered almost fearless, due to him never being afraid to fight beside other knights. Bors was known for his great power and agility, due to the fact that he had once slain 3 dragons with a slash of sword.

Maurice Richard

Maurice "Rocket" Richard (1921-2000) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. He played for the Montreal Canadiens. He played for 18 years (1942-1960) in the National Hockey League (NHL), totaling 544 goals and 421 assistants (965 points), in 978 regular season games played. His goals scored were the most in NHL history until Gordie Howe scored his 545th in the early 1960s. Richard is considered one of the fiercest competitors and prolific goal scorers who ever played in the NHL. The "Rocket", as he became known, was followed by his brother, Henri Richard ("Pocket Rocket"). They are both ranked in the top 100 NHL hockey players of all time, "Rocket" ranked # 5, with the "Pocket Rocket #30.
Richard's first goal was against the New York Rangers on November 8, 1942. The 1944–45 NHL season was a record-setting one for Richard. He first set a new mark for points in one game when he made five goals and three assists in a 9–1 victory over the Detroit Red Wings on December 28, 1944; his eight points broke the previous record of seven held by three players； Richard broke the record on February 25, 1945, in a 5–2 victory over Toronto. Malone was on hand to present Richard with the puck used to score the 45th goal.Richard missed over 20 games of the 1951–52 season due to injury, but overcame another ailment in the playoffs.The 1952–53 season began with Richard in close pursuit of Nels Stewart's all-time NHL record of 324 goals.Richard fulfilled his promise to Canadiens' fans as he led Montreal to a Stanley Cup championship in 1955–56. The season began with the arrival of his young brother Henri to the Canadiens roster. The playoff goal was Richard's last, as on September 15, 1960, he announced his retirement as a player. Richard had reported to Montreal's training camp that fall, but Selke compelled Richard to end his playing career, fearing he was risking serious injury. In Richard's retirement speech, he said he had been contemplating leaving the game for two years, and stated that at age 39, the game had become too fast for him.
Richard also called "the Comet" when his early playing career but then he was remark "The Rocket" because of his teammate Ray Getliffe, his style like rocket; his speed, strength and determination were all strong. His teammate Toe Blake said the moniker was fitting because "when he would take off, nothing got in his way that could stop him". Goaltender Jacques Plante said it often showed in Richard's eyes and comparing it to "the rocket's red glare" referenced in " The Star-Spangled Banner ". When he flying his eyes were all lit up."
As Richard struggled both with the need to find a purpose to his post-retirement life and the fear of being forgotten, he attached his name to numerous endeavours. He acted as a consulting editor for a magazine titled "Maurice Richard's Hockey Illustrated", owned the "544 / 9 Tavern" in Montreal, and was a pitchman for dozens of products, 
including beer, hair dye, car batteries, fishing tackle and children's toys. He continued to use his name as a promotional vehicle for over 30 years after his retirement. Richard briefly returned to hockey in 1972 as head coach for the Quebec Nordiques of the World Hockey Association. He lasted only two games, a win and a loss, before finding himself 
unable to handle the strain of coaching.
Richard and his wife, Lucille, lived in Montreal where they raised seven children: Huguette, Maurice Jr., Norman, André, Suzanne, Polo and Jean. They had 14 grandchildren. Lucille died of cancer in 1994, two years after the Richards celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Richard's companion late in his life was Sonia Raymond. It was announced in 1998 that Richard was suffering from abdominal cancer. As his health deteriorated, Richard was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, and doctors suspected he had Alzheimer's disease. He died on May 27, 2000 of respiratory failure as a result of his cancer.

Forgot About Dre

"Forgot About Dre" is the second single off American hip hop musician Dr. Dre's second studio album "2001". The song was released in January 29, 2000 and features vocals from Eminem. The song won a Grammy Award for "Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group" in 2001.
It was called a stand-out track by Stephen Thomas Erlewine. NME said of the song: "In case folks been smoking too much heavy 'chronic' lately, West Coast rap founder and scary legend Andre Young, aka Dr Dre, jogs their memories on 'Forgot About Dre'. "Who you think brought you the Eazy Es, Ice Cubes and DOCs, the Snoop- D-O-G-Gs and the group that said motherf-- the police?" yammers the one-time NWA lynchpin, ex Death Row playa, inventor of - G-Funk and occasional breaker of rival producers' jaws. Yo, indeed, big bad Dre's back and, despite a four-year gap since his last hardcore missive, the Doc's recent collaboration with Eminem on 'The Slim Shady LP' has kept his legend simmering." The song also won an MTV Video Music Award for "Best Rap Video" in 2000.

Brenda's Got a Baby

"Brenda's Got a Baby" is the debut solo single by American rapper 2Pac. It was featured on his debut studio album "2Pacalypse Now". The song also features vocals from Dave Hollister.
The song is about twelve-year-old girl named Brenda who lives in a ghetto, has a baby by her cousin, and is not able to support it. She runs away from home, becomes a prostitute and is murdered. The song explores the issue of underage pregnancy and the effect on both the young mothers and their families. Like many of Shakur's songs, it draws from the trouble of the poor. By using Brenda to represent young single mothers in general, Shakur criticises the lack of support from the father of the baby, the government, and society in general. He wrote the song after he read an article in the newspaper about a twelve-year-old girl who got pregnant by her cousin and threw the baby in a trash compactor.

Plating

Plating is a surface covering in which a metal is put on another metal surface. Plating has been done for hundreds of years, and it is important for modern technology. 
Plating is used to decorate objects, prevent corrosion, to harden, to improve wearability, to reduce friction, to allow painting, to alter conductivity, and for other purposes. Jewelry typically uses plating to give a silver or gold finish. Objects can be plated with films as thin as a single atom, so plating finds uses in nanotechnology.
There are several plating methods, and many variations. In one method, a solid surface is covered with a metal sheet, and then heat and pressure are applied to fuse them (a version of this is Sheffield plate). Electroplating is a very common method.

<doc id="448135" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=448135" title="Kaworu Nagisa">
Kaworu Nagisa

Kaworu Nagisa is a character from Neon Genesis Evangelion. He appears in episode 24 of the television show, sent to Nerv by Seele in order to replace the pilot of Unit 02, Asuka Langley Soryu, whose synchronization ratio has fallen too low for her to pilot her Evangelion. Kaworu is both the Fifth Child and the 17th Angel. He and Shinji Ikari enjoy a brief friendship, in which Kaworu tells Shinji that he loves him and that he was probably born to meet him. Soon after Kaworu is discovered as the 17th Angel, however, Shinji is forced to kill Kaworu so that humanity can survive. Kaworu's last words are "Thank you. I'm glad I met you" (to Shinji), and in the aftermath of Kaworu's death, Shinji states that he loved him too, and that Kaworu should have been the one to live.
Kaworu Nagisa reappeared in the film End of Evangelion to first weaken Unit 01's AT field so that Instrumentality could commence, then later in Shinji's mind along with Rei Ayanami to help Shinji choose the decision to reject Instrumentality in favor of individual thought and form, even if it meant having to deal with pain again.
Kaworu Nagisa is portrayed much differently in the Neon Genesis Evangelion manga. While the original series depicted Kaworu as selfless, eloquent and loving, the Kaworu in the manga is awkward and invasive. Even with a new characterization, however, Kaworu still displays attraction towards Shinji, even kissing Shinji in an attempt to stop Shinji's hyperventilation, and verbally wondering what it would be like if Shinji "came to love [him]". When Kaworu's nature as an Angel is revealed, he again forces Shinji to kill him, saying that this way, he will not be able to forget him.
In the "Neon Genesis Evangelion New Theatrical Version" (also known as "Rebuild of Evangelion"), Kaworu plays a slightly bigger role. He first appears near the end of "1.0: You are (not) alone", waking up in a coffin on the moon. He then stands up and looks to the earth, commenting that "the Third hasn't changed", and that he is looking forward to meeting him (Shinji Ikari). 
In "2.0: You can (not) advance", Gendo Ikari and Kozo Fuyutsuki visit Seele's moon base to observe the construction of Unit 06, and see Kaworu sitting atop Unit 06's finger, wearing only pants. Kaworu seems to address Gendo as "Father", although it is unknown whether he meant it literally or metaphorically. Kaworu is also briefly seen putting on a plugsuit, still on the moon, while Mari Illustrious Makinami gets ready to battle Zeruel in the Geofront. His last appearance in 2.0 is at the very end of the movie, after the credits roll. What is presumably a Lance of Longinus is hurled down towards earth and ends up impaling Unit 01, halting Third Impact. Kaworu is then seen descending towards earth in Unit 06, with an uncharacteristically angry look on his face. He promises that this time, he will bring Shinji happiness. 
In the next movie, "3.0: You can (not) redo", Kaworu plays a much larger role. As Asuka and Shinji in Unit 01 fall down to earth, Kaworu says that he has been waiting for Shinji. He is next seen playing piano in Nerv HQ, after Shinji is brought there by Unit 00. Shinji's father later informs Shinji that he is to copilot a new Evangelion unit, Unit 13, alongside Kaworu (not saying Kaworu's name). Kaworu then calls out to Shinji, and requests that he play piano. He is hesitant at first, but with Kaworu's guidance the two are able to play a duet together quiet beautifully, despite Shinji's claim that he could not play. Kaworu introduces himself, and tells him that they are both children bound by fate. Kaworu and Shinji continue to play piano together (which indirectly helps them synchronize to activate Unit 13 together later on), and come to see each other as friends, Kaworu commenting that he "really was born to meet" him - an almost exact quote from his role in the original series. When Shinji expresses his fear at what happened in the 14 years he was gone, Kaworu shows him the destruction of near-Third Impact, emphasizing that it was all brought about by Shinji, but also assuring him that "there is always hope" and later telling Shinji that together, they can fix everything with the two spears in Central Dogma. 
Prior to piloting Unit 13, Kaworu removes the DSS choker from Shinji's neck and places it on his own so that Shinji will not have to fear death while they activate Unit 13. After descending to Central Dogma in order to retrieve the spears, however, Kaworu realizes that something is off. He urges Shinji not to take the spears, but Shinji shuts off his controls and removes them anyways. Shortly after this, Fourth Impact starts and Unit 13 awakens. The DSS choker begins to activate, and Shinji is driven to despair with the knowledge that he caused Fourth Impact and that Kaworu, perhaps his only friend at this point, is about to die. 
In spite of everything, Kaworu claims that it was he who was the trigger for Fourth Impact, because he became the 13th Angel. Before dying, Kaworu apologizes to Shinji for not being able to bring him happiness and promises that they will meet again. The collar then detonates, leaving Shinji near-comatose, similar to his state at the start of End of Evangelion.

It added support for the iPad 2 and later, as well as the iPad Mini. Two weeks later, iOS 7 Beta 3 was released on July 8, 2013. Until iOS 7 Beta 4, a new beta was being released every two weeks. iOS 7 Beta 4 was released on July 29. 2013, three weeks after the third beta was released. The fifth beta, iOS 7 Beta 5, was released on August 15, 2013, and brought many fixes and improvements.
At their iPhone event on September 10, 2013, Apple announced that iOS 7 would be officially released to everyone on September 18, 2013, for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.
Apple released iOS 7.1 on March 10, 2014 and it is the first major update to the operating system since it was first released in September 2013. It was released almost 5 months after the first beta of iOS 7.1 was released to developers. It made several improvements to the operating system including performance improvements and Siri enhancements. It also adds support for a new feature called CarPlay, which works by connecting an iPhone to a car that has a touchscreen. It is currently available for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, and iPhone 5S.
iOS 7 was announced during the first keynote of the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10, 2013. It was the "biggest change to iOS since the introduction of the iPhone", because the most noticeable change was a change to the entire operating system. In a video that was shown during the keynote, the update had many changes to the app icons, adding layers, and using translucent effects throughout the operating system. iOS 7's design departs from elements like green felt in Game Center, wood in Newsstand, and leather in Calendar, in favor of a flat, colorful design.
A new feature called AirDrop is introduced in iOS 7. It supports the iPhone 5 and later, the iPod Touch (5th generation), the iPad (4th generation) and later, and the iPad mini (1st generation) and later. With AirDrop, you can share files, photos, videos, and more by turning on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and choose the person you want to share with. You can make yourself discoverable to your contacts or everyone.
The App Store introduces a new feature called Popular Near Me, which allows the user to find apps that are popular in their area. The App Store also supports automatic updates, meaning that apps will update by themselves and that the user does not have to update the apps.
The Camera app has a new look and supports video recording, camera, and panorama mode (on some iPhone and iPod touch models), as well as a new square photo mode. iOS 7 also includes photo filters, a new Burst mode, and 120 fps video recording (on devices that support it).
A new feature, Control Center, can be seen by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. It provides quick access to features such as Airplane Mode, brightness, music controls, AirPlay, AirDrop, and shortcuts to camera, calculator, clock, and a built-in flashlight. You can also turn Bluetooth on/off, Do Not Disturb on/off, lock the screen's orientation, and play, skip, or pause a song.
iTunes Radio is an ad-supported service that is available to all iTunes users and includes integration with Siri. Users are able to skip songs, create stations, and buy songs from the iTunes Store. They can also search through their history of songs that they have played. The number of songs that they can skip is limited, just like Pandora Radio.
Currently, iTunes Radio is only available in the U.S. and Australia, but it will be rolled out to other countries in the future. It is only available on iTunes, iOS, and Apple TV.
iOS 7 provides full multitasking for all apps. That means that apps will update their content by themselves and instead of showing the app icon, it shows a screenshot of what the app looks like.
CarPlay is a new feature that was released as part of iOS 7.1. It uses Siri to answer phone calls, respond to text messages, give directions, and play music while keeping your eyes on the road. It uses the car's screen to do this. It works by connecting an iPhone to the car. CarPlay currently supports the iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, and iPhone 5S.

Biochemical cascade

A biochemical cascade (or signalling pathway) is a series of chemical reactions. It is started by a stimulus (first messenger) acting on a receptor. The 'message' is passed on to the cell interior through other reactions. These later chemical reactions amplify (build up) the initial signal. Eventually there is a cell response to the initial stimulus. The passing series of chemical changes is a cascade, and the whole process is called signal transduction.

Complement system

The complement system helps or “complements” the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear pathogens from an organism. It is part of the innate immune system. 
The complement system consists of a number of small proteins found in the blood, made by the liver. Normally they circulate as inactive precursors ("pro-proteins"). When stimulated by a trigger, proteases split specific proteins to release active cytokines. This starts a series (a cascade) of further cleavages which release more cytokines. This amplifies (makes bigger) the response. So, if the original stimulus was an invading bacterium, the cytokines disrupt the phospholipid bilayer cell membrane of the target, which kills it.

Dick Turpin (1705 - 7 April 1739) was an English highwayman. He made a lot of money through many criminal activities, such as poaching, burglary, horse theft and murder. He is most famous for 'highway robbery', on his horse, Black Bess. He was eventually captured and hanged at York Castle in 1739. 
Turpin was born in Hempstead, Essex. He was firstly believed to be involved with a gang of poachers, who stole and sold deer that belonged to the King. The rest of his gang were captured and hanged in 1735.
After this, Turpin started robbing rich people on the highways between cities. He didn't stay in one place, so police could not catch up with him. He robbed people across the South of England. For a while, he tried to hide by calling himself John Palmer.
However, people were suspicious that he had a lot of money, and he was arrested for horse theft. He was charged with this offence and hanged in Knavesmire, York on 7 April 1739.

Glacial lake

A glacial lake is a lake that is made as a glacier melts. The glacier erodes the land, and then as it melts, water fills the hole or space that has been created. 
Near the end of the last glacial period, about 10,000 years ago, glaciers began to retreat. A retreating glacier often left behind large amounts of ice in hollows between drumlins or hills. As the ice age ended, these melted to create lakes. This can be seen in the Lake District in Northwestern England. Glacial lakes are often surrounded other evidence of the glacier including drumlins, moraines, eskers, striations and chatter marks.
The glaciers crush minerals in the rock as they pass over them. These minerals become sediment at the bottom of the lake, and some of the rock flour becomes suspended in the water. These minerals support a large population of algae, making the water look green.
These lakes can be seen in aerial photos of landforms in:
The coastlines near these areas are often very irregular, formed by the same geological process. Other areas have fewer lakes that often are part of river systems. Their coastlines are smoother. These areas were carved more by erosion

Salt lake

A salt lake, or saline lake, is a lake with a lot of sodium chloride and other dissolved minerals in the water. It is often defined as three grams or more of salt per litre. In some cases, salt lakes have more salt than sea water: they are called hypersaline lakes. An alkaline salt lake with a high content of carbonate is called a soda lake.
Salt lakes can be put into categories based on salinity:
Salt lakes form when the water flowing into the lake, containing salt or minerals, cannot leave. This is because the lake is endorheic (a dead end). The water then evaporates, leaving behind any dissolved salts. This increases its salinity. Salt lakes are an excellent place for salt production. High salinity will also lead to a unique flora and fauna in the lake. Sometimes the large amount of salt means there is little life in or near the lake.
If the amount of water flowing into a lake is less than the amount evaporated, the lake will eventually disappear and leave a dry lake: a 'playa', salt flat or salt pan.

Lake Hindmarsh

Lake Hindmarsh, in western Victoria, Australia, is the state’s largest natural freshwater lake. The nearest towns are Jeparit to the south and Rainbow to the north. It is a large shallow lake which is often dry. The lake filled after floods in 2011, having been dry for nearly ten years.
The area around the lake is the traditional country of the Gromiluk, a group of the Wotjobaluk people. Explorer Edward Eyre camped at Lake Hindmarsh in 1838 while searching for an overland route from Melbourne to Adelaide. By 1845 Europeans were settling near lake. In 1859 the Moravian Ebenezer Mission was established nearby.
Lake Hindmarsh is the first lake of the Wimmera River Terminal Wetlands. Its water comes directly from the Wimmera River. When full, the lake covers , is deep and holds 378 GL of water. It is a wetland of national significance. If Lake Hindmarsh overflows, water flows on to the deeper Lake Albacutya, which is a Ramsarwetland of international importance.
Because it is so shallow, water in Lake Hindmarsh evaporates quite quickly. When it is full, evaporation from the lake is around 140,000 ML per year. As the Wimmera River usually only adds about half that amount, the lake is rarely full. It takes three to four years to evaporate entirely.
The lake was full during the wet years of the early to mid-1970s. It had a commercial fishing industry. The lake was used for water sports, including water-skiing. The lake filled in 1996, but then received no further water from the Wimmera River and had dried up by 2000. It remained dry for almost a decade. 
In October 2009, water from the Wimmera River trickled into Lake Hindmarsh for the first time in 13 years. The 2010 Victorian floods raised water levels higher many birds returned to the lake. After the January 2011 Victorian floods, it was hoped the Wimmera River would fill the lake and overflow into the northern lakes. However, outlet creek remained dry and the lake again awaits its next flooding event.

Lake Tuscaloosa is a reservoir in west-central Alabama. It was created by damming North River. It was built to provide water for people living in Tuscaloosa, Alabama and also for industrial use. It was completed in 1970. It cost about $7,725,000. The lake is very popular for recreational activities.
Lake Tuscaloosa was built because because more people were living in Tuscaloosa. The reservoirs already there, Harris Lake and Lake Nicol, didn't provide enough water. A dam was built on North River. When that dam filled, the water behind it became Lake Tuscaloosa. Lake Tuscaloosa provides more water than either of the other two reservoirs. Lake Tuscaloosa's water is treated to make it safe for people to drink. It also provides untreated water for industrial use.

Water from the Wimmera River flows into Lake Hindmarsh. When full water from Lake Albacutya flows along Outlet Creek, and begins to fill further small lakes and wetlands to the north. This has not happened since 1976.
Because the lake has less salt than Lake Hindmarsh, Lake Albacutya supports a denser cover of vegetation in its dry phase. 
The lake has not received any inflow for some years and remained dry throughout the wetter years of 2011-2012.

Lake Colac

Lake Colac is a large freshwater lake in western Victoria, Australia. The town of Colac is built along the south shore of the lake. Lake Colac has an area of 1,820 hectares, an average depth of 2.5 metres and a circumference of 33 km. The area was the home of the Kolijon (or Coladjin) people. The name "Colac" comes from either the word "Kolijon", or their word "kolak" which means the lake's sand or fresh water.
The lake is used for watersport, including sailing, rowing and water skiing. The foreshore has a playground and a boat ramp. The Colac Botanical Gardens are next to the lake. In January 2009, the lake dried up after years of drought. Water enters the lake from Barongarook Creek, but the lake usually loses more water through evaporation. The lake needs to get water from rain falling directly over it to keep up a high level. Water quality in Lake Colac is low because of nutrients, such as phosphorous and nitrogen entering the lake. This has come from farms and untreated sewerage. There has also been chemicals and rubbish from the town of Colac. These can cause blue green algae to grow in the lake which makes the water unsafe for humans or animals. There have been efforts made to improve water quality by stopping these nutrients from getting into the lake. 
The lake has redfin, eels and carp, and in 2013 it was proposed to put estuary perch into the lake.

NXT Women's Championship

The NXT Women's Championship is a professional wrestling championship in the WWE. The title is a NXT-only championship. It is competed for between the women's wrestlers.
The title was introduced at WrestleMania Axxess on April 5, 2013. On the May 30, 2013 tapings of "WWE NXT", Stephanie McMahon announced that there would be a tournament between four developmental talents and four main roster Divas. Paige defeated Emma in the tournament finals to become the first NXT Women's champion. 
After Paige debuted on the main roster and won the WWE Divas Championship, she held both championships. On the April 24, 2014 episode of NXT, NXT Commissioner JBL stripped Paige of the NXT Women's Championship because of her not being able to defend the NXT Women's Championship as the WWE Divas Champion.
Another tournament was started the following week. Sasha Banks would qualify over Bayley, Natalya would qualify over Layla, Alexa Bliss would qualify over Alicia Fox and Charlotte would qualify over the former number-one contender, Emma. During the semifinals, Natalya defeated Sasha Banks, and Charlotte defeated Alexa Bliss. At "NXT Takeover", the finals took places and Charlotte defeated Natalya to win the vacant NXT Women's Championship.
The current champion is Sasha Banks, who is in her first reign. She won it after defeating Bayley, Becky Lynch, and then-champion Charlotte in a Fatal 4-Way match at "" on February 11, 2015.

<doc id="448349" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=448349" title="Trophic state index">
Trophic state index

The trophic state index (TSI) is a measure of how much nutrient, such as nitrogen and phosphorus are in a lake, or other body of water. Nutrients increase plant growth, and raise the trophic levels. The TSI can be used to make an estimate of the biological condition of a lake.
Carlson's Index is a Trophic State Index. It is used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The "trophic state" is the total weight of biomass in a given water body at the time of measurement. The Carlson index uses the algal biomass to classify a lake's trophic status. 
Three variables are used to work out the Carlson Index: "chlorophyll pigments", "total phosphorus" and "Secchi depth". Chlorophyll is the most accurate measure, as it is the best predictor of biomass. Phosphorus may be better in summer. Secchi depth is the least accurate measure, but it is the cheapest and easiest to use. It measures how clear the water is. This shows how much dissolved and particulate material is in the water. This can be used to work out the biomass.
A lake can be put into one of three possible classes: "oligotrophic", "mesotrophic" or "eutrophic". Lakes with extreme trophic indices can also be called "hyperoligotrophic" or "hypereutrophic". Each trophic class has different types of fish and other organisms which live in them. If there is too much algal biomass in a lake or pond, then many fish can die as the decomposing biomass takes the oxygen from the water.
Oligotrophic lakes have very little or no aquatic vegetation and the water is clear. They have low levels of nutrients. The water is suitable as drinking water. The bottom waters of such lakes typically have lots of oxygen; thus, such lakes often support many fish species. Lake trout, for example, need cold, oxygen rich water. The oxygen content is likely to be higher in deep lakes, because of their larger amount of dense cold water.
Oligotrophic lakes are most common in cold areas. They are often on top of a layer of igneous rocks (especially granitic bedrock).
Mesotrophic lakes are lakes with a medium level of productivity. They usually have clear water with beds of submerged aquatic plants and medium levels of nutrients.
The term mesotrophic is also applied to terrestrial habitats. Mesotrophic soils have moderate nutrient levels.
Eutrophic lakes have large amounts of organisms, including algal blooms. They have a lot of nutrient and can support a lot of
aquatic plants and algae. Usually the water body will be dominated either by aquatic plants or algae. When there are a lot of aquatic plants the water tends to be clear. When there is a lot of algae the water tends to be darker. The process of photosynthesis in the algae supplies oxygen to the fish and plants which live these waters. Sometimes an excessive algae bloom will occur. This can kill fish by using all the oxygen in the water. The process of eutrophication can occur naturally and by human impact on the environment.
"Eutrophic" comes from the Greek "eutrophos" meaning "well-nourished", from "eu" meaning good and "trephein" meaning "to nourish"
Hypereutrophic lakes are very nutrient-rich lakes with frequent large algal blooms and low transparency. Hypereutrophic lakes have a visibility depth of less than three feet. They also have high levels of chlorophyll and phosphorus. The algal blooms can also reduce oxygen levels which can cause dead zones beneath the surface.
Both natural and human actions can decide a lake or other water body's Trophic Index. A lake in a nutrient-rich region may be
naturally eutrophic. Nutrients carried into water bodies, such as agricultural runoff, residential fertilisers, and sewage will all increase the algal biomass, and can easily cause an oligotrophic lake to become hypereutrophic.
Often, different people want different trophic states. For example duck hunters may want a lake to be eutrophic so that it will support large numbers of ducks. Residents, on the other hand, may want the same lake to be oligotrophic, as this is more pleasant for swimming and boating. Natural Resource agencies are generally responsible for managing the different demands and deciding what a lake's trophic index should be.

Ullswater

Ullswater is the second largest lake in the English Lake District. It is about nine miles (14.5 kilometres) long and 0.75 miles (1,200 m), wide with a maximum depth of slightly more than .
Many regard Ullswater as the most beautiful of the English lakes, it has been compared to Lake Lucerne in Switzerland. 
It is a typical Lake District narrow "ribbon lake" formed after the last ice age when a glacier scooped out the valley floor. When the glacier retreated, the deepened section became a lake.Three separate glaciers formed the lake. The surrounding mountains give Ullswater the shape of a stretched 'Z' with three distinct segments (or 'reaches') that wend their way through the surrounding hills.
For much of its length Ullswater forms the border between the ancient counties of Cumberland and Westmorland.
The village of Glenridding, at the southern end of the lake, is popular with tourists of all kinds. For mountain walkers, England's third highest mountain, Helvellyn and other challenging peaks are near the lake. The village has ample accommodation including two Youth Hostels and camp sites. The village of Pooley Bridge is at the northern end of the lake. Its narrow 16th-century bridge straddles the River Eamont as it flows out of Ullswater; it is overlooked by Dunmallard Hill, which was the site of an Iron Age fort. On the western side of the lake is Aira force waterfall. Near there the Brackenrigg Inn overlooks sweeping views of the dramatic landscape.

Derwent Water or Derwentwater is one of the main lakes in the Lake District National Park in north west England. It is in the Borough of Allerdale in the county of Cumbria.
The lake lies immediately south of the town of Keswick. It is both fed and drained by the River Derwent. It is about long by wide and is some deep. There are several islands in the lake, one of which is inhabited. Derwent Island House, an 18th-century residence, is a tenanted National Trust property open to the public on five days each year. 
Derwentwater is very scenic. It is surrounded by hills (known locally as fells), and many of the slopes facing Derwentwater are wooded. A regular passenger launch operates on the lake, taking passengers between various landing stages. There are seven lakeside marinas, the most popular stops being: Keswick, Portinscale and the Lodore Falls, from which boats may be hired. Recreational walking is a major tourist activity in the area and there is a network of footpaths in the hills and woods surrounding the lake.
The Keswick—Borrowdale road runs along the eastern shore of the lake and carries a regular bus service. There is a lesser road along the western shore connecting the villages of Grange and Portinscale.
Derwentwater gave its name to the Earldom of Derwentwater.
The lake is believed to be the last remaining native habitat of the vendace ("Coregonus vandesius") fish.

Ennerdale Water

Ennerdale Water is the most westerly lake in the Lake District National Park in Cumbria. It is a glacial lake, with a maximum depth of 150 feet (45 metres). At ½ mile to a mile (700 to 1,500 metres) wide and 2½ miles (3.9 kilometres) long is one of the smallest lakes in the area. To the west of the lake lies the small village of Ennerdale Bridge, with of two pubs and a few houses. It is close to the port of Whitehaven, the town of Cleator Moor and the village of Cleator.
In 1810 a large carnivore killed hundreds of sheep in and around Ennerdale before it was hunted down and killed. The Girt (dialect for 'Great') Dog of Ennerdale was a mysterious creature that killed between 300 and 400 sheep over six months in the fells of Cumberland, England, in 1810. 
It is now commonly thought that the Girt Dog of Ennerdale was a thylacine (otherwise known as the Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf.) Travelling circuses and menageries of the time were known to keep what were described as “tiger wolves” – a description that fits the thylacine perfectly. As import laws and animal control were so relaxed in the early part of the nineteenth century, an escape from one of these itinerant shows is easy to imagine.
Though the Lake District is a popular UK location for film shoots, Ennerdale has been left relatively in the shadow, with only a few brief exceptions. The closing sequences of the film "28 Days Later" (2002), directed by Danny Boyle, were filmed around the Ennerdale area, and include a sweeping, panoramic view of the lake.
Once a year, during the last week in August, the Ennerdale Show brings local people together with agricultural displays, competitions, arts and crafts. 
Former US President Bill Clinton proposed to his wife Hillary on the banks of Ennerdale Water in 1973.

<doc id="448362" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=448362" title="Lake Mungo">
Lake Mungo

Lake Mungo is a dry lake in the south-western part of New South Wales, Australia. It is about 760 km due west of Sydney and 90 km north-east of Mildura. The lake is the main feature of Mungo National Park. It is one of 17 lakes in the World Heritage listed Willandra Lakes Region.
Many important archaeological discoveries have been made at the lake. This includes Mungo Man, the oldest human remains found in Australia, and Mungo Lady, the oldest human remains in the world to be ritually cremated.
It is also the site of the "Lake Mungo geomagnetic excursion," the first convincing evidence that Geomagnetic excursions are a geomagnetic phenomenon rather than sedimentological.
Sediments at Lake Mungo have been deposited over more than 100,000 years. On the eastern shore of the lake are the 'Walls of China'. These are a 26 km long series of lunettes, about 30 metres high, formed over thousands of years. There are three distinct layers of sands and soil forming the Walls. The oldest is the reddish Gol Gol layer, formed between 100,000 and 120,000 years ago. The middle greyish layer is the Mungo layer, deposited between 50,000 and 25,000 years ago. The most recent is the Zanci layer, which is pale brown, and was laid down between 25,000 and 15,000 years ago.
The Mungo layer, which was deposited before the last ice age period, is the most archaeologically rich. It was a time of low rainfall and cooler weather, but more rainwater ran off the western side of the Great Dividing Range, keeping the lake full. It supported a large human population, as well as many varieties of Australian megafauna.
During the last ice age period, the water level in the lake dropped, and it became a salt lake. This made the soil alkaline, which helped to preserve the remains left behind in the Walls of China. Although the lake completely dried up several thousand years ago, ground vegetation remained on the Walls. This which helped to stabilise them and preserve them. With the arrival of European settlers in the area in the 1880s, introduced species, mostly rabbits, sheep and goats have destroyed the vegetation cover. This has led to increased erosion of the dunes. However, this erosion has led to the uncovering of many human and animal remains. Wind has moved sand and soil eastwards from the Walls, forming a mobile sand dune which moves further east every year.
The most important findings at Lake Mungo have been Mungo Man and Mungo Lady. Mungo Lady, a partly cremated body, was discovered in 1969 by Dr Jim Bowler from the Australian National University (ANU). At first she was thought to be 25,000 years old. A more recent study in 2003 found that she was probably closer to 40,000 years old. Mungo Lady is the earliest known human to have been cremated. Mungo Man was also discovered by Dr Bowler, on 26 February 1974. The remains were covered with red ochre, in what is the earliest known incidence of such a burial practice. Although some studies have shown his age at more than 60,000 years, the current agreement is that he is also about 40,000 years old.
Humans have been living around Lake Mungo for at least 50,000 years. Stone tools have been found in the dunes which are older than the Mungo Man. Grinders for making flour have been found which are between 5,000 and 10,000 years old; they were made of sandstone sourced from the
Murray River basin 100 km away. A stone axe head, at least 500 years old, was also found in the dunes; it was made from stone from Mount Camel, near Shepparton, well over 300 km away.
The rich archaeological heritage of the site is very significant to the Aboriginal Australian people from the area. The Willandra region is home to the Barkindji, Nyiampaa and Mutthi Mutthi people. They have Joint Management Agreements with the Government of New South Wales to manage the lake and the Mungo National Park.
In 1972, Archaeomagnetic studies were carried out on the prehistoric aboriginal fireplaces found along the ancient shoreline of Lake Mungo. Magnetization preserved in oven-stones and baked hearths show that the axial dipole field moved up to 120 degrees from its normal position around 30,000 years ago. This is called a geomagnetic excursion. Because most of the excursions found before Lake Mungo were in sedimentary material, it had been thought that the magnetic field directional anomalies were detrital or diagenetic in origin. The Lake Mungo results were due to thermoremanent magnetization, ruling out a sedimentological phenomena.
Two excursions have been recorded in sediments from Skjonghelleren on Valderøy, Norway. The Virtual Geomagnetic Pole (VGP) of one happened at the same time as Lake Mungo which suggests the event was global rather than local. Data from lake sediments of a similar age in France having near identical magnetic field lines also support Lake Mungo being a global event. However, it has been suggested that Lake Mungo's anomalous field is the result of lightning strikes.

Gippsland Lakes

The Gippsland Lakes are a network of lakes, marshes and lagoons in east Gippsland, Victoria, Australia. They cover an area of about . The largest of the lakes are Lake Wellington, Lake King and Lake Victoria. Water enters the lakes from the Avon, Thomson, Latrobe, Mitchell, Nicholson and Tambo rivers.
The Gippsland Lakes were formed by two main actions. The first was by silt from the rivers creating river deltas. The Mitchell River created silt jetties which run into Lake King for several kilometres. The second action was the sea in Bass Strait which created the Ninety Mile Beach which blocked the rivers from reaching the sea.
Once the rivers were blocked the water level of the lakes would gradually rise. The water would finally break through the barrier beach and the level would drop to sea-level. Eventually the beach would close-off the lakes and the cycle would begin again. Sometimes it would take many years before a new channel to the sea was formed and it was not always in the same place as the last one.
In 1889 a wall was built to fix the position of a natural channel between the lakes and the ocean at Lakes Entrance. This stabilised the water level, made a harbour for fishing boats and opened the lakes to shipping. This entrance needs to be dredged regularly, or the same process that created the Gippsland Lakes would maker the entrance too shallow for ships to pass through.
Due to the flooding, in 2011, Gippsland Lakes were experiencing bioluminescence.
The lakes support numerous species of wildlife. There are two protected areas: The Lakes National Park and Gippsland Lakes Coastal Park. The Gippsland Lakes wetlands are protected by the international Ramsar Convention on wetlands. There are also approximately 400 indigenous flora species and 300 native fauna species. Three plants, two of them being orchid species, are listed as endangered.
The lakes are home to about 50 Bottlenose dolphin, the Burrunan dolphin ("Tursiops australis").
The wetlands provide habitat for about 20,000 waterbirds. This includes birds from Siberia and Alaska. The lakes have been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because they regularly support over 1% of the global populations of Black Swans, Chestnut Teals and Musk Ducks, as well as many Fairy Terns.
The Gippsland Lakes are, in order of size:
Lake Wellington covers an area of 148.19 square kilometres. It is connected to Lake Victoria by McLennan Strait. 
Lake Victoria covers an area of 78.14 square kiolmetres.
Lake King covers an area of 96.84 square kilometres.
Lake Reeve is a long lake, with many salt marshes.
Lake Tyers is not connected to the other Gippsland Lakes, and makes its own entrance to Bass Strait.
The eastern shore of Lake Coleman is part of the Lake Coleman Wildlife Reserve. There is also a small reserve on the western shore called the Lake Coleman West Wildlife Reserve. The reserve covers an area of about 1500 hectares. Most of Lake Coleman is used by the Department of Defence for training purposes.

On September 15, 1997, He refereed a tryout dark match between Chris Taylor and Kendall Windham before WCW Monday Nitro at Independence Arena in Charlotte, NC. A week later, he was signed by World Championship Wrestling (WCW).
His first appearance for WCW was at the WCW TV tapings at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. He turned heel, refereed Four Horsemen matches and aligned himself with Ric Flair. During his heel run, he favored the Horsemen in matches he refereed which annoyed Randy Savage. Savage, who was suspended by Flair (then-WCW President), proposed a match between Robinson and Savage's girlfriend Gorgeous George where if George defeated Robinson, Savage would be reinstated. The match took place on May 9, 1999 at "Slamboree 1999". Robinson (dubbed "Little Naitch") copied Flair's signature strut, "wooo!" catchphrase and even wore a robe similar to Flair's. Robinson would lose the match after George hit him with a diving elbow drop.
When the World Wrestling Federation bought WCW in March 2001, they hired Robinson. Robinson was a part of The Alliance. The first match that he refereed in the WWF was on July 2, 2001. Even though he was a part of the Alliance, he was mainly a fair and impartial referee. On the July 1, 2004 episode of "SmackDown!", he was forced to wrestle Luther Reigns by then-General Manager Kurt Angle. The match was quickly stopped by Charlie Haas however.
On April 18, 2014, while he was traveling with the WWE in Saudi Arabia, he suffered a freak accident after he nearly lost his thumb when he deeply cut it while helping to set up the wrestling ring. He received 6 stitches from a nearby WWE medic.

Lake Macquarie (New South Wales)

Lake Macquarie or Awaba, is the largest coastal salt water lake in Australia. It covers an area of . It is on the coast of New South Wales, north of Sydney. The city of lake Macquarie is on the shores of the lake. Lake Macquarie is connected to the sea by a short channel.
Aborigines of the Awabakal nation lived in the area for thousands of years. The name "Awaba", means "a plain surface".
The first European to discover the lake was Captain William Reid in 1800. Reid had been sent from Sydney to get a load of coal from Newcastle Harbour. Reid took a wrong turn and found himself in a lake rather than a river, with no coal to be seen anywhere. The name "Reid's Mistake" was used until 1826, when it was renamed in honour of Governor Lachlan Macquarie.
The lake is an irregular shape. The land between the lake and the sea is only a few kilometres wide along most of its length. There are several small, sandy, low-level islands in the lake. Pulbah Island, located south of Swansea is a large island with rocky cliffs. It covers an area of . Pulbah is an Aboriginal name meaning "island". Pulbah Island is also a sacred site for the Awabakal people.
Lake Macquarie is connected to the sea by Swansea Channel and Lakes Entrance. Swansea Channel is about wide and long. The bridges over the channel can lift to allow yachts and other boats in and out of the lake.
The eucalypt forests on the southern edge of the lake have been listed by BirdLife International as a 121 km Important Bird Area (IBA). They support significant numbers of endangered Swift Parrots and Regent Honeyeaters. Masked Owls and Ospreys often nest in the area.
In 1983 the State Pollution Control Commission studied the poor water quality of Lake Macquarie. It found increased amounts of sediment and increased levels of nutrients were causing problems. Further studies in 1995 found that creeks flowing into the lake were causing many of these problems. In 1998 a special group was set up by the government to find ways to protect the lake. This group recommended setting up the Lake Macquarie Project Management Committee. Their job was to put in place an action plan to protect the lake called the Lake Macquarie Improvement Plan. 
These actions have included reducing the amount of sediment and nutrients getting into the lake. They have built wetlands, stormwater treatments, replanting, and educating the local community.
There are more fish in the lake because commercial fishing has been stopped in the lake and the water quality is improving.
Fishing, boating, kayaking and water skiing are all popular activities on the lake.

Blue Lake (South Australia)

The Blue Lake is in Mount Gambier, South Australia. It is in an extinct volcanic crater, which is part of the Mount Gambier complex. It is one of four crater lakes on Mount Gambier. Leg of Mutton Lake and Brown Lake have dried up over the past 30 to 40 years as the water table has dropped. The Blue Lake is known for its changing color, from grey to bright blue.
Different dates have been given for its last eruption, of 28,000 years ago, 4300 years ago, and, recently, a little before 6000 years ago. If the youngest date is correct, this could be the most recent volcanic eruption on the Australian mainland.
Blue Lake is thought to be of an average depth of 72 metres, but in places reaches 77 metres deep. The crater rim measures 1,200 metres (3,937 feet) by 824 metres (2,703 feet). The lake itself measures 1,087 metres (3,566 feet) by 657 metres (2,155 feet). The bottom of the lake is 30 metres (100 feet) below the level of the main street of the nearby town. The Blue Lake supplies the town with drinking water.
In 1967 a survey found the deepest point in the lake at 77 m. Major diving exploration of the lake first took place in 1985. Cave diver Peter Horne studied the temperature and visibility of the water. He discovered a fresh water sponge species and other invertebrates. He also discovered "The Stromatolite Field", hollow rock formations on the north-eastern edge at a depth of 40 m. In 2008 another dive brought up core samples from the calcite-silt covered lake bed, and measured the water temperature on the lake bed at 14 degrees Celsius (57 °F).
During December to March, the lake turns to a vibrant cobalt blue colour. It changes to a colder steel grey colour for April to November. Why this happens is still a mystery. Scientists believe water on the surface becomes warmer in summer. This causes calcium carbonate to precipitate out of solution and allows micro-crystallites of calcium carbonate to form. This results in scatter of the blue wavelengths of sunlight. During winter the lake water becomes well mixed, and the lake water is less clear because of tannins and calcium carbonate particles. The angle of the sun has also been found to influence the perceived colour of the lake. The movement of planktonic life-forms within the lake during the seasons and during the day may also play a part in the colour change.
In July 1865 Adam Lindsay Gordon performed the daring horse riding feat known as Gordon’s Leap on the edge of the Blue Lake. A commemorative obelisk was built at the spot. The sign on it reads: "This obelisk was erected as a memorial to the famous Australian poet. From near this spot in July, 1865 Gordon made his famed leap on horseback over an old post and rail guard fence onto a narrow ledge overlooking the Blue Lake and jumped back again onto the roadway. The foundation stone of the Gordon Memorial Obelisk was laid on 8th July 1887".

Probability space

Probability space is a mathematical model used to describe scientific experiments A probability space consists of three parts:
An "outcome" is the result of a single execution of the model. Since individual outcomes might be of little practical use, more complex "events" are used to characterize groups of outcomes. The collection of all such events is a "σ-algebra" formula_1. Finally, there is a need to specify each event's likelihood of happening. This is done using the "probability measure" function, "P".
Once the probability space is established, it is assumed that “nature” makes its move and selects a single outcome, "ω", from the sample space Ω. All the events in formula_1 that contain the selected outcome "ω" (recall that each event is a subset of Ω) are said to “have occurred”. The selection performed by nature is done in such a way that if the experiment were to be repeated an infinite number of times, the relative frequencies of occurrence of each of the events would coincide with the probabilities prescribed by the function "P".
The prominent Soviet mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov introduced the notion of probability space, together with other axioms of probability, in the 1930s.

The Gambler (novel)

The Gambler is a novel by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky. 
It is about the bad side of gambling and has to do with Dostoyevsky's own experiences from his travels to Wiesbaden, Baden-Baden and other casinos. At the time when he wrote The Gambler he had serious financial problems. The Gambler was also turned into an opera by Sergei Prokofiev.
The Gambler was made public in 1867 short time after Crime and Punishment. In the summer 1865 Dostoyevsky had promised to his publisher Stellovsky to create a novel until 1. November. Otherwise the publisher would get the publishing rights for other works of Dostoyevsky without having to pay. Dostoyevsky accepted this. So Dostoyevsky dictated the novel in only 26 days to his typist and later wife Anna. Stellovsky left St. Petersburg on 31. October to make the delivery impossible. But Anna had the idea to deliver the novel to a notary (a kind of a lawyer) and like that they were able to deliver the novel until the promised date.

The lake is 6.2 km southeast of Kingfisher Resort. It is 1,200 metres long and up to 930 metres wide. It covers an area of about 150 hectares.
The sand around the lake is pure, white silica. The water in the lake is also so pure it is unsuitable for many species.
Facilities for visitors around the lake include camping areas, picnic areas, toilets and barbecues.
In March 1944 a military training camp was set up at the lake. It was closed late the same year.

Ground sloth

Ground sloths are a group of extinct large sloths in the mammalian superorder Xenarthra. 
The term "ground sloth" is used as opposed to the much smaller living "tree sloths". Their most recent survivors lived in the Caribbean Antilles, where they may have survived until about 2819 and 2660 BC. This was the last known occurrence of "Megalocnus" in Cuba. Ground sloths had been extinct on the mainland of North and South America for 10,000 years or more. Their later survival in the Caribbean correlates with the later colonization of this area by humans. Some island sloth populations persisted 5,000-6,000 years longer than their continental mainland relatives. This fits the global pattern of late Quaternary large vertebrate extinction due to human dispersal.
Most ground sloth evolution took place during the mid to late Tertiary of South America while the continent was isolated. At their earliest appearance in the fossil record, the ground sloths were already distinct at the family level. The presence of intervening islands between the American continents in the Miocene allowed a dispersal of forms into North America. A number of mid- to small-sized forms are believed to have previously dispersed to the Antilles islands either by making short swims or using land bridges. Ground sloths were a hardy group: their numbers and dispersals into remote areas are evidence of this. Remains have been found in Patagonia (Cueva del Milodón), and parts of Alaska.
Sloths, and xenarthrans as a whole, were one of the more successful South American groups during the Great American Biotic Interchange. In general, during the interchange, many more taxa moved from North America into South America than in the other direction. However,at least five genera of ground sloths have been identified in North American fossils; these are examples of successful migration to the north.

Paramylodon

Paramylodon is an extinct genus of ground sloth. It was endemic to North America in the Pliocene, and to the end of the Pleistocene epoch. It lived from around ~4.9 million years ago (mya) to 11,000 years ago.
"Paramylodon" was about 3 m (9.8 ft) in height and weighted as much as 1089 kg. It is known from deposits in the United States, Mexico and as far south as Guatemala.
There is just one recognized species, "P. harlani", (Owen) 1840, which is commonly referred to as Harlan's ground sloth in honor of the American paleontologist who first discovered and described a lower jaw in 1835. 
Like the South American "Mylodon", "Paramylodon" had dermal ossicles: small bones embedded in the skin. This made it harder for predators if they attacked from behind. Its skull and teeth suggest it was, like the other members of its group, a browser on leaves and small branches. It ate standing on its hind legs and using its huge hands to pull the vegetation into its mouth. Skeletons found in the La Brea tar pits were more or less complete.

He went to school and university in England but he always dreamed of travel. He didn't make many friends when he studied in England. During his first university holidays he travelled alone, without much money, from England to Istanbul. This was the start of an exciting life filled with adventure in Africa, Iraq and the Arabian Peninsula. 
Thesiger was one of the last great British explorers and he was an excellent photographer and writer. When Thesiger died in 2003, he left more than 38,000 photographs to the Pitt Rivers museum in Oxford. Thesiger wrote many books, some of which are considered to be classics. He was a tall, strong man and a successful boxer. 
Thesiger travelled through the UAE with his Bedouin friends and even met Sheikh Zayed in Al Ain. (In 2003, the UAE gave money to the Pitt Rivers museum to help keep Thesiger's photos safe). Thesiger had a deep respect for his Bedouin friends who he thought of as better than himself because they were generous, brave and always cheerful. Each time Thesiger and his Bedouin friends met other people, they stopped, invited them to eat their food, and enjoyed sharing the latest news. 
Thesiger loved a simple lifestyle. He didn't like cars or the radio. For the rest of his life he always wanted to go back to the desert.
He died in Croydon, London.

Penny Arcade is a webcomic about video games. It was created by Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik. The comic debuted in 1998. Now, the comic has its own website which also hosts other comic strips. In addition, the site has information about Child's Play, a children's charity, and PAX, a gaming convention. Both are by Holkins and Krahulik.
The comic strip is about two characters who are based on the creators of the comic strip. John "Gabe" Gabriel is based Mike Krahulik, and Tycho Brahe is based on Jerry Holkins. Gabrial is happier, but can become very angry. Tycho Brahe (named after the astronomer Tycho Brahe) is unhappy and serious. The characters go through the same events their creators do, but react differently. Most of the comic strips involve the two characters commenting on nerd culture, usually video games. The strip has large amounts of cursing and has been known to offend people.
Krahulik and Holkins have released podcasts called "Downloadable Content" since March 20, 2006. A series of four video games loosely based on the comic strip titled "" began on May 21, 2008. Tycho appeared in the game "Poker Night at the Inventory" alongside characters from "Team Fortress 2", "Strong Bad" and "Sam & Max". "Penny Arade: The Series" is a reality televesion show about the strip and the Penny Arcade company that began on February 20, 2010.

Rolling and wheels in the natural world

There are two ways that natural and man-made things can use rotation to move around. One way is for the entire thing to roll. The other way is for part of the thing to turn while the rest does not, like a wheel or a propeller. Some living things move around by rolling, but no living things seem to use wheels. Biologists have written about the reasons for this. Writers of science fiction and fantasy have invented many animals with wheels.
Wheels are a very useful technology for people. Many technologies that people use are also found in nature, like wings and lenses.
It may seem strange, then, that wheels have never evolved in nature, but there are two reasons for this. First, there are natural limits to what kinds of things can exist in nature. Living things change slowly over time, a process called evolution by natural selection. This process can create many different answers to a problem, but it can't always create every answer that can be imagined. Also, the ways that new living things build themselves (a process called developmental biology) can't always create every kind of part that can be imagined. Second, wheels are sometimes less useful than other ways of moving, like walking, running, or slithering like a snake. For the same reason, some groups of people in the past have given up using wheels completely. 
Some living things move around by rolling. These are not true examples of wheels, because the whole organism rotates, without any parts that stay still, like an axle.
Some kinds of animals form their bodies into a circle. In some cases, they do this to protect themselves, and in some cases they do it to be able to roll. Animals that do this include some caterpillars, tiger beetle larvae, myriapods, mantis shrimp, and salamanders. Other animals form into a ball instead. These animals include pangolins, hedgehogs, armadillos, the armadillo lizard, isopods, the wheel spider, and fossilized trilobites. These animals may roll "passively", meaning they are pushed by gravity or wind, or "actively", meaning they push themselves by changing their shape. Tumbleweeds are a part of a plant that grows above the ground. Tumbleweeds break off from their roots and roll in the wind in order to spread their seeds.
Dung beetles form round balls of animal feces. They roll these balls with their bodies. Although the ball rolls instead of the beetle, the beetles have many of the same problems as rolling animals.
A kind of skin cell called a keratinocyte moves itself by rolling, as part of the process of healing.
A kind of tiny animal called a rotifer uses a ring of cilia (small hair-like parts) moving in rhythm to move and feed itself. The word "rotifer" in Latin means "having wheels", but rotifers do not actually have any parts that rotate.
No known multicellular organism (an organism made of many cells) can spin part of its body while keeping the rest of its body still. However, there are at least two examples of rotating parts used by cells. One example is a molecule called ATP synthase. ATP synthase is used to store and move energy. For example, it is used in the processes of photosynthesis (a way of storing energy from the sun) and oxidative phosphorylation (a way of releasing stored energy). ATP synthase is similar to flagellar motors, which are talked about below. Biologists (scientists who study life) think that ATP synthase is an example of modular evolution. In modular evolution, two parts with different jobs join together and pick up a new job.
The only known example in nature of a part that can spin all the way around to push an organism is the flagellum. The flagellum is a tail used like a propeller to push single-celled prokaryotes. The bacterial flagellum is the best known example. About half of all known bacteria have at least one flagellum. This means that rotation may actually be the most common way of moving around found in nature.
At the bottom of the bacterial flagellum, where it meets the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as an engine. This engine gets its power from proton motive force, the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the cell membrane. This is caused by a concentration gradient (a difference in the number of protons on each side of the membrane) created by the cell's metabolism. (Bacteria called "Vibrio" use two kinds of flagella, one of which is powered by sodium ions instead.) Flagella are very efficient, meaning not much energy is wasted. They can push bacteria as fast as 60 times their length every second. The motor at the bottom of the flagellum has a similar structure to ATP synthase. Bacteria called spirillum have twisted bodies with flagella on both ends. Spririllum bacteria spin around as they move.
A kind of organism called archaea, which are different from bacteria, also use flagella powered by rotating motor proteins. The two kinds of flagella evolved from different parts. Eukaryotic cells are a more complex kind of cell found in plants and animals. Some of these cells also have flagella called cilia, but these flagella do not rotate at the bottom. Instead, they bend so that the tip of the flagella moves in a circle.
The science of evolution can help to explain why multicellular organisms have not developed wheels. To put it simply, a complex structure (one made of several parts working together) can't evolve unless its early, unfinished form helps the organism to live and to have children.
In the modern science of evolution, adaptations (changes that affect the fitness of an organism) appear slowly, over many generations, by means of natural selection. Because of this, genetic changes usually only spread in a population if they do not lower the fitness of individuals. Neutral changes (changes that don't raise or lower fitness) can spread by genetic drift. In some cases, changes that lower fitness can spread, but large changes that take many steps can only spread if each of the steps raises fitness. The biologist Richard Dawkins describes the situation this way:
In this metaphor, fitness is a landscape, where useful traits are peaks and harmful ones are valleys. Wheels may be a very useful peak, but the valley around that peak is too low or too wide for the gene pool (the set of genes in the population) to move to it by genetic drift or natural selection. Stephen Jay Gould points out that evolution can only build with parts that are already available. He writes that, "wheels work well, but animals are debarred [(prevented)] from building them by structural constraints [(limits)] inherited as an evolutionary legacy."
Natural selection therefore explains why wheels have not appeared. A wheel without one or more of its important parts would probably not help an organism very much. However, the same is not true for the flagellum discussed above. As the flagellum evolved, different parts of other structures were used for a new purpose. The part that is now a rotating motor, called a basal body, may have evolved from a part that was used by bacteria to inject poisons into other cells. This use of existing parts is called "exaptation".
The biologist Robin Holliday has written that, because there are no living things with wheels, creationism and intelligent design (stories of life that claim an intelligent creator) are less likely to be right. Holliday argues that an intelligent creator, free from the limits of evolution, would use wheels in any place they would be useful.
People have found it fairly easy to build wheeled systems, even complex ones, and they have been able to solve problems of power transmission (moving energy from one place to another) and friction. However, the ways new organisms build themselves are very different from the ways humans build things. It is not clear that the processes of life would be able to make a wheel. The reasons for this are talked about below.
The greatest barrier to many-celled organisms with wheels is the interface (meeting point) between the parts that move and the parts that stay still. Wheels, or wheels and axles, need to be able to turn freely relative to the rest of the organism. Animal joints have a limited range of motion (the angle they can move), but wheels need to be able to turn through any angle without needing to be turned back. Because of this, wheels can't be attached to the axle or shaft that they turn on. No true many-celled organism is known to grow solid tissues or organs that are not attached to the rest of the organism.
To drive a wheel (that is, to make it turn), something must put a torque (twisting force) on it. For machines made by people, this torque is usually made by a motor. There are many kinds of motors, such as electric motors, turbines, and steam engines. Torque can also come from a person, as with a bicycle. In animals, movement is usually caused by skeletal muscles. These muscles get energy by metabolizing (breaking down) the nutrients in food. Skeletal muscles are attached with connective tissue to the bones they move, so they would not be useful for driving a wheel directly. Also, animals use their muscles in cycles - joints move in one direction, then the other, instead of moving in one direction constantly. Large animals cannot gain speed very quickly, because it is more difficult for muscles to pull against a large inertia (the resistance of a heavy object to movement).
In most machines, a lubricant (like oil or grease) or a bearing is used to limit friction (rubbing) between moving parts. Keeping friction down is important for limiting wear damage to the parts, and for keeping the parts from getting too hot. The faster the parts move, or the more force between them, the more important it is to reduce friction. In animal joints like the human knee, friction is reduced with a tissue called cartilage that has a low coefficient of friction, and a lubricating fluid called synovial fluid that has a low viscosity (resistance to flowing). Gerhard Scholtz, a professor at the ("Institute for Biology and Comparative Zoology") at Humboldt University of Berlin, has written that a similar lubricating fluid or material from dead cells could help an animal wheel to turn freely, but something like this has never been seen in nature.
Another problem is the flow of materials to and from a living wheel. If the tissues that form the wheel are living, then they must receive oxygen and nutrients and have wastes taken away in order to continue metabolism (the process of using energy to maintain functioning). A normal animal circulatory system (the network of tubes that allow blood to flow), would not be able to provide for the necessary flow of materials. Without blood flowing, materials would have to diffuse to and from the wheel. Diffusion is limited by partial pressure and surface area, by a rule called Fick's law of diffusion. For large animals, diffusion would not be enough to keep tissues alive. Instead of a living wheel, a wheel could be made of dead material like keratin, which makes up hair and nails.
In some environments, wheels are simply not as good as limbs for getting around. So it may be that, even if it were possible for wheels to evolve, they would not be found often in nature. In fact, given the limits of wheels, the main question can be turned around: instead of asking ""Why doesn't nature use wheels?", the question becomes "Why don't people build more machines with limbs?"" In engineering, wheels are often used instead of limbs, because limbs are more complex to design and control—not because wheels necessarily do the job better.
On hard, flat ground, like paved roads, hard wheels are more energy efficient than other ways of moving around. However, wheels are not as efficient (they take more energy to move) on soft surfaces, like soils, because they have to deal with "rolling resistance". In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy as the shape of the wheel and the surface are deformed (changed), and the surface pushes back against the wheel. Smaller wheels have to deal with more resistance for their size than larger wheels. Softer surfaces deform more than hard surfaces, and they don't come back to their starting shape as well. This causes greater resistance. Compared to concrete, the resisting force on medium-hard soil can be five to eight times greater, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs only cause a small deformation at the point that the foot touches the ground.
Rolling resistance is also the reason that some human civilizations didn't use wheels. During the Roman Empire, wheeled chariots were common in the Middle East and North Africa. However, when the Empire fell, wheels became less useful to the local people, who turned to camels to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. Stephen Jay Gould wrote about this strange fact of history in his book "Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes". He wrote that without maintained roads, camels needed less human power and water than a cart pulled by oxen.
When moving in water, rotating mechanisms are more efficient only when the "Reynolds number" of the flow is very low. The Reynolds number is a way to describe the behavior of a flow—in a flow with a low Reynolds number, like those in which bacteria move, viscosity is the most important effect to consider. In flows with high Reynolds numbers, inertia is the most important effect, and mechanisms that "oscillate", or move back and forth, are more efficient. Although ship propellers usually have an efficiency near 60%, and aircraft propellers around 80% (up to 88% in the human-powered "Gossamer Condor"), oscillating foils like fish tails and bird wings can be as efficient as 96%−98%.
Wheels can slip, meaning they fail to get a grip, on loose or slippery ground. Slipping wastes energy, and can lead to loss of control or becoming unable to move. This happens to cars on mud, ice, and snow. Where wheels have this problem, people sometimes use other mechanisms instead. In the logging industry, vehicles with legs are sometimes used to reach areas that are more difficult than what wheels can deal with. Vehicles with tracks, like tanks, don't slip as much as vehicles with wheels, because they have a larger area touching the surface. However, vehicles with tracks often have a larger turning radius than wheeled vehicles, meaning they take more space to turn. They are also less efficient, and more complex to build.
The engineer Mieczysław G. Bekker showed that in natural terrain, small obstacles are much more common than large ones. This is called a "log-normal" distribution. This means that obstacles are a problem for wheeled vehicles of all sizes. The main ways of dealing with obstacles are to go around them, and to go over them.
The most common types of steering do not include separate articulation (joints for bending) for each wheel, so they have a limited turning radius. This limits how well these kinds of vehicles can move around where there are a large number of obstacles.
Michael LaBarbera of the University of Chicago shows the limited turning radius of wheels by comparing humans walking with humans in wheelchairs. Jared Diamond points out that most examples of rolling in nature are found in wide open, hard terrain. This includes the use of rolling by dung beetles and tumbleweeds.
Wheels are bad at dealing with vertical (upright) obstacles, especially obstacles about the same size as the wheel itself. If a vehicle or animal can move its center of mass, then the largest vertical obstacles that can be climbed are half as high as the wheel. If the center of mass cannot be moved, the highest obstacle that can be climbed is one eighth to one quarter the height of the wheel.
Also, without joints, a wheeled vehicle can become stuck (unable to move) on top of an obstacle, with the obstacle between the wheels so they don't touch the ground. Limbs, unlike wheels, are useful for climbing, and can deal with difficult terrain.
For wheels without joints, climbing obstacles will cause the body of the vehicle to tilt. If the weight of the vehicle moves outside of the wheels, the vehicle can tip over because of "static instability". At high speed, a vehicle's inertia can cause it to become "dynamically unstable". This means it can be tipped over by a smaller obstacle, or simply by turning or changing speed too quickly. Without jointed limbs, it can be impossible to recover from being tipped over.
Limbs used by animals to move over terrain are often also used for other purposes, such as holding and manipulating things, climbing, swinging from branches, swimming, digging, jumping, throwing, kicking, and grooming. Without joints, wheels are not as useful as limbs for these jobs.

Charles Elson "Buddy" Roemer III (born October 4, 1943) is an American politician and banker. He served as the 52nd Governor of Louisiana from 1988 to 1992. He last was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1981 to 1988.
Roemer was a candidate for the presidential nominations of the Republican Party and the Reform Party in 2012.
In March 1991, while serving as governor, Roemer switched his party from the Democratic to the Republican Party. In 2012, he became a member of the Reform Party. A year later, Roemer switched parties to become a Republican again.
Roemer was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. His parents were Charles Elson "Budgie" Roemer, II and Adeline McDade. He was raised in Bossier City.
In 1964, he graduated from Harvard College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. In 1967, he received an MBA in finance from Harvard Business School. After college, Roemer returned to Louisiana to work in his father’s computer business and later founded two banks. He was elected in 1972 as a delegate to the Louisiana Constitutional Convention held in 1973.
As a member of Congress, Roemer Louisiana's 1st congressional district in the northwestern section of the state, anchored about Shreveport and Bossier City. After his 1980 election victory, Roemer won congressional re-election without opposition in 1982, 1984, and 1986.
In Congress, Roemer frequently supported Reagan policy initiatives and fought with the Democratic congressional leadership, though he remained in the party. He also criticized then Democratic House leader Tip O'Neill of Massachusetts for being "too liberal".
After Roemer left the House to become governor, he was succeeded by his administrative assistant, Republican Jim McCrery.
Roemer was one of a large number of Democratic candidates to challenge three-term incumbent governor Edwin Edwards. Roemer won the election by winning 33% of the vote compared to Edwards' 28%.
Roemer entered the governor's office on March 14, 1988. In October 1989, voters rejected a number of Roemer tax initiatives but approved a constitutional amendment for transportation improvements. Facing a $1.3 billion deficit in the state budget, his first job was eliminating the deficit. Roemer called a special session of the legislature to push an ambitious tax and fiscal reform program for state and local governments. He vowed to slash spending, abolish programs, and close state-run institutions. Voters rejected his proposals in a statewide constitutional referendum.
In March 1991, Roemer switched to the Republican Party just months before the state elections, apparently at the urging of Bush White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu. Roemer lost his re-election after loosing the Republican primary to David Duke. Duke would soon loose to Edwin Edwards.
Roemer left office on January 13, 1992. He would run again for the Republican nomination for governor, but lost to Mike Foster.
In the summer of 2004, Roemer briefly considered entering the race to succeed retiring U.S. Senator John Breaux. Roemer shortly after decided not to run for the senate.
In January 2011, Roemer told Baton Rouge television station WAFB that he was considering a bid for the U.S. presidency in 2012. On July 21, 2011 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, Roemer announced his entry as a candidate for the Republican nomination for President. On November 30, 2011, Roemer officially announced that he would seek the Americans Elect nomination. On February 23, 2012, Roemer dropped out of the GOP nomination to seek the Reform Party's nomination. On May 17, 2012, Americans Elect announced that it would not run a candidate in the 2012 presidential elections. 
On May 31, 2012, he announced that he was ending his 2012 presidential campaign altogether, citing the lack of ballot access to be the reason
Roemer was married to Cookie Delmer until they divorced. Then he married Patti Crocker until they divorced. He is now married to Scarlett Roemer. Roemer has three children with Delmer.

Pine nuts are the edible seeds of pines (family Pinaceae, genus "Pinus"). About 20 species of pine produce seeds large enough to be worth harvesting. Other pines have edible seeds too small to be useful as a human food.
Pine nuts have been eaten in Europe and Asia since the Paleolithic period. They are often added to meat, fish, salads and vegetable dishes or baked into bread. In Italian they are called "pinoli". They are an essential part of Italian pesto sauce.
Pine nuts can be pressed to extract pine nut oil, which is valued for its mild, nutty flavour. The large edible seeds of the Southern Hemisphere conifer genus "Araucaria" produce nuts rather like pine nuts.

Brampton Bryan Castle

Brampton Bryan Castle is a castle in the small village of Brampton Bryan in north-western Herefordshire, England, 50m south of the River Teme. The castle guarded an important road from Ludlow along the Teme Valley to Knighton and on into Central Wales.
The castle is listed in the Domesday Book (1086). In 1295 it was described as a "tower with curtilage". The castle was almost entirely destroyed during the Civil War. The ruins that are still standing include an outer gate house, parts of the inner gatehouse, part of the south wall of the kitchen, and the great hall.
When Bryan de Brampton died in 1294, his son-in-law, Robert Harley, inherited the castle. For almost 700 years since the castle has remained in the Harley family. During the Civil War, the castle was defended by Lady Brilliana Harley, the wife of Robert Harley. Harley was a puritan and a Member of Parliament.

Wall clouds (or pedestal clouds) are localized, large and persistent lowering cloud formations that develop below the rain-free region of thunderstorms. Rotating wall clouds are indicative of mesocyclones in thunderstorms. Wall clouds do not always rotate, though.
Wall clouds are formed by a process known as entrainment, when an inflow of warm, moist air rises and overpowers rain-cooled air during a downwind downdraft.

Technical support scam

A technical support scam is a form of telephone fraud that tricks people by pretending that they are a service which helps people fix their computers. In most cases they convince the victim they have a computer problem that does not actually exist. A common type is when someone gets a call from someone (usually from places like India or Pakistan) pretending to be from a company that sounds real such as "Microsoft" or "Windows" support. Often the caller tries to gain the victim's trust. They may use confusing and very technical language to sound authentic. They may ask the victim to perform several tasks on their computer. Often they target legitimate files on the victim's computer saying these are viruses. These tactics are designed to scare people into letting the scammer fix the problem (that does not really exist). The caller may have the victim install malicious software that could capture sensitive data, such as online banking passwords or credit card information.

Sidewinding

Sidewinding is a type of locomotion unique to some snakes. They use it to move across loose or slippery ground like sand or mud. It is often used by the Saharan horned viper, "Cerastes cerastes", and the sidewinder rattlesnake, "Crotalus cerastes", to move across loose desert sands. It is also used by some snakes in Southeast Asia to move across tidal mud flats. Other snakes can be induced to sidewind on artificial smooth surfaces, with various degrees of success. Sidewinding is not the only way snakes can move on sand.
Sidewinding is done by simply lifting all the segments with the same slope off the ground. In the movement, the snake's body is always in static (as opposed to sliding) contact with the ground. The head seems to be "thrown" forward, and the body follows, being lifted from the prior position and moved forward to lie on the ground ahead of where it was originally. Meanwhile, the head is being thrown forward again. In this way, the snake slowly progresses at an angle, leaving a series of mostly straight, J-shaped tracks. Because the snake's body is in static contact with the ground, imprints of the belly scales can be seen in the tracks, and each track is almost exactly as long as the snake.
Below is a crude animated line-drawing showing sidewinding in action. The light brown areas are the tracks left behind, and show where the body of the snake touched the ground. 
This mode of locomotion overcomes the slippery nature of sand or mud by pushing off with only static portions on the body. The static nature of the contact points can be shown from the tracks of a sidewinding snake, which show each belly scale imprint, without any smearing. This mode of locomotion has very low caloric cost, less than ⅓ of the cost for a lizard or snake to move the same distance. Contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence that sidewinding is associated with the sand being hot.

Moore had played on two Memorial Cup winners, one with the Montreal Royals in 1949 and Montreal Junior Canadiens the following year. He was known for his hard accurate shot and his ability to stickhandle the puck. He twice won the Art Ross Memorial Trophy as the league's leading scorer. Moore broke Gordie Howe's record of 95 total points in a regular season play with 41 goals and 55 assists.
Moore won the Stanley Cup for the first time in 1953 and was a member of the Montreal Canadiens team that won five cups in a row from 1956–60.

Dit Clapper

Aubrey Victor "Dit" Clapper (February 9, 1907 – January 21, 1978) was a Canadian Hall of Fame ice hockey player, playing his entire professional career for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League. 
Clapper was the first NHL player to play twenty seasons, and one of only two to be an All-Star at both forward and defence. The right wing on the powerful "Dynamite Line"—one of the first forward lines to receive a nickname in hockey history—along with linemates Cooney Weiland and Dutch Gainor, he contributed to the breaking of several scoring records in the 1930s. Towards the end of his career, he was named player-coach of the Bruins, and held the coaching position after his retirement as a player.
Aubrey Clapper, son of Bill Clapper, was raised in Hastings, Ontario. Clapper was given his nickname at an early age when he would lisp his name, the result coming out "Dit."
Clapper started his hockey career at age 13, playing minor hockey in Oshawa, and going on to play with the junior league Toronto Parkdale club of the Ontario Hockey Association in 1925, scoring a goal in the team's Memorial Cup run that season. The following season he turned professional, playing for the Boston Tigers of the Canadian-American Hockey League.
The Boston Bruins bought Clapper's contract from the Tigers in 1927. Hitherto a defenceman, Bruins' coach Art Ross decided to try Clapper at right wing, and the experiment stuck. He scored his first NHL goal - ten seconds into his first shift—in the season opener against the Chicago Black Hawks.
The following season, Ross teamed Clapper up with Cooney Weiland and Dutch Gainor to form the Dynamite Line, one of the first named forward lines in history. The Bruins won the American Division that season and went on to their first Stanley Cup championship, with Clapper scoring the winning goal in the first game of their best-of-three series with the New York Rangers. 
In the 1930 season, the league changed the passing rules, effectively eliminating offsides. The Stanley Cup champion Bruins took especial advantage, breaking many scoring records and recording the highest winning percentage the league would ever see, unsurpassed as of 2012. Leading the charge was the Dynamite Line, as Weiland led the league in scoring, Clapper finishing third and Gainor finishing ninth; Clapper's goal total of 41 was the third most in league history at that time. The Dynamite Line scored 102 of the Bruins' league record 179 goals, as many as last-place Pittsburgh managed. While Clapper scored four goals in six playoff games, the Bruins were shocked in the Stanley Cup finals by the Montreal Canadiens in their best-of-three series.
While Clapper kept his production high in the 1931 season, Gainor's scoring fell off badly, and the Dynamite Line was broken up at season's end. Clapper's 22 goals were good for eighth in the league, and he was named Second Team All-Star at right wing at year's end, the first season such All-Stars were named. The following year Clapper—with Bud Cook replacing the traded Gainor on his line with Weiland—was named team captain and again finished eighth in league scoring, but an injury-riddled Bruins' team fell into last place and out of the playoffs. While Weiland was dealt to Ottawa for the 1933 season, the Bruins purchased Montreal Maroons star Nels Stewart and paired him with Clapper to form a powerful offensive unit that led the Bruins back to a division championship.
The largest forward of his era at 6'2" and 200 lbs, Clapper was a notably peaceful player who nonetheless was involved in an unusual incident in the 1937 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Montreal Maroons. Highsticking Maroon Dave Trottier twice in the head, referee Clarence Campbell (the future NHL president) called Clapper a profane name, and Clapper knocked the referee to the ice with a single punch. Speculation was heavy that Clapper's punishment would be severe, but Campbell himself pleaded Clapper's case, stating that he felt he had provoked the Bruin into the blow; Clapper received only a $100 fine for the incident.
By 1938, Ross believed the Bruins needed an overhaul, and as part of it asked Clapper to move back to defence. Paired with perennial superstar Eddie Shore on the backline, the move proved highly successful, and Clapper was named a First Team NHL All-Star on defence in 1939, 1940 and 1941, leading the Bruins to Stanley Cup victories in 1939 and 1941.
In February 1942, Clapper suffered a severed tendon in a collision with Toronto player Bingo Kampman and was done for the season. It was feared he would be forced into retirement, but he came back next year and returned to form. During the 1944 season, Clapper broke Hooley Smith's career record for games played, holding the record until Maurice Richard surpassed him in 1957.
During the 1944 season, Clapper filled in as interim coach when Art Ross took ill. In 1945 Ross retired as Bruins' coach, retaining his general manager's position, and named Clapper as player-coach, the only one in team history. Clapper retained his team captaincy until his retirement as a player in 1947, ultimately serving as team captain for longer than any NHL player until Ray Bourque surpassed his total in the 1990s.
Due to injuries and with his skills not what they used to be, Clapper originally retired before the start of the 1946–47 season, but returned to play in November 1946 to replace the injured Jack Crawford in the Bruins' lineup. He played only once in awhile thereafter, and retired for good on February 12, 1947. Leading the Bruins to a 10-1 victory over the New York Rangers in his final game (in which Bill Cowley broke the league career scoring record, the Bruins further announced that day that his number #5 sweater would be retired, and the Hockey Hall of Fame immediately inducted him as an Honoured Member; he was the only active player ever to be inducted into the Hall, and at the time the only living Member inducted. 
Of his prowess, Bruins goaltending legend Tiny Thompson said: "Clapper diagnosed the plays like a great infielder in baseball," said. "He put himself where the puck had to come."
He coached the Bruins for two more seasons until, unhappy with the club's performance in the 1949 playoffs against Toronto and uneasy about coaching friends with whom he had played, he resigned. Save for a single season coaching the American Hockey League's Buffalo Bisons in 1960, in which the team recorded a 33-35-4 record and failed to make the playoffs, he did not again participate in professional hockey.
Clapper ran a plumbing firm and a sporting goods store in Peterborough in retirement, while serving as a director of the Peterborough Petes of the OHA. He briefly attempted a political career, standing as a Liberal candidate for the Peterborough West riding in the 1949 federal election, losing by less than 250 votes to incumbent Progressive Conservative Gordon Fraser.
Dit Clapper died of complications from a 1973 stroke, which had left him confined to a wheelchair, on January 21, 1978. He is buried in Trent Valley Cemetery, Hastings, Ontario.
In 1983, the Bruins signed former Montreal Canadiens star Guy Lapointe, Lapointe sought to wear his customary #5 jersey, which had been retired in Clapper's honor nearly forty years before. Team general manager Harry Sinden agreed to Lapointe's request, but under protests from Clapper's family, Bruins superstar Bobby Orr and the public, Lapointe was switched to #27 after a handful of games.
In August 2012, former NHL coach Scotty Bowman, who was a young Peterborough Petes coach when Clapper served on the club's board of directors, paid tribute to Clapper. The occasion was the unveiling by Dit's daughter, Marilyn Armstrong, of a new street sign named "Dit Clapper Drive" in Hastings, Ontario.

Footprint

Footprints are shapes on the ground where people or animals walked. The foot touches the ground and at that position a footprint appears afterwards. This can happen because the ground is muddy or snowy and the foot sinks a little bit into the ground. Another possibility is that the foot is dirty or has fresh color on it. When the foot touches the ground the dirt or color remains at the ground and marks the position of contact. 
Footprints mark the way of people or animals. Hunters for example are able to follow an animal by following its footprints. Like that leaving footprints can be a big disadvantage. 
In the time of internet people also talk about digital footprints. This are not real footprint but small bits of data (for example the IP address) which enable computer professionals to follow the way of an user in the internet. This can also be a disadvantage for the user who is leaving the digital footprints.

Papal supremacy

In the Roman Catholic Church, the pope is seen as the highest clergy and as the head of the church. In short, anything the pope says in his function of head of the church is valid for the whole church. The pope has full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church, a power which he can always exercise unhindered: that, in brief, "the Pope enjoys, by divine institution, supreme, full, immediate, and universal power in the care of souls." This means that the situation of the pope is similar to that of an absolute monarch or the leader of a Fascist state.

Equality Act 2010

The Equality Act 2010 is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom.
Before 2010, there were many different Acts (laws) and Regulations (rules) in Great Britain which protected against different kinds of discrimination. The Equality Act's goal was to put all of these laws and protections together into one law, and make it easier to understand.
All of these laws were put together to make the Equality Act:
The Equality Act has the same goals as the four major European Union Equal Treatment Directives (laws made by the European Union that protect against discrimination). 
The Equality Act protects against discrimination because of:
The Act says that all of these groups must be treated equally at work, when applying for jobs, and in private and public services.
People with disabilities have special protections under the Act. The Act says that employers and service providers (like stores or schools) have to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities if needed. Reasonable accommodations are changes to places or ways of doing things that help people with disabilities do their jobs, go to school, and do other important things just like people without disabilities can. Accommodations do not have to be made if they are not reasonable (if they would be very expensive or difficult to make).
Most of the Equality Act does not apply to Northern Ireland.

Proto-Sinaitic script

Proto-Sinaitic is a Middle Bronze Age script. It is known only from a few inscriptions at Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai Peninsula. 
Because there are so few Proto-Sinaitic signs, little is known with certainty about the nature of the script. The script co-existed with Egyptian hieroglyphs, so it is likely that it represented true writing, but this is not certain. From the shape of the signs, Proto-Sinaitic may be an alphabet, and the ancestor of the Phoenician alphabet, from which nearly all modern alphabets descend.
There have been two major discoveries of inscriptions of the Proto-Sinaitic script. The first was in the winter of 1904–1905 in Sinai by Hilda and Flinders Petrie, dated to circa 1700–1400 BC. The second find was more recently in 1999 in Middle Egypt by John and Deborah Darnell. This is dated to the 18th century BC.

Source is meant to power first person shooter video games, but has also been used to create other types of video games as well.
A full list of features can be found at Valve's Developer Feature List.
The Source SDK has been criticized for being out of date and hard to use.
The Source engine originated from the GoldSrc, which was a changed version of John D. Carmack's Quake engine.
Caramack said on his blog in 2004 that there's "still bits of Quake code in Half-Life 2".
Valve worker Erik Johnson explains the origins of the GoldSrc engine on the Valve Developer Community:
The Source engine then continued to replace the GoldSrc engine, until Source was mostly used at Valve.
In 2005, Valve launched a website called the Valve Developer Community, which told users how to use the Source engine.

While he was in western Louisiana, Taylor often disagreed with Edmund Kirby Smith. Smith commanded the Confederates west of the Mississippi River. Because they disagreed so often, Taylor was sent east of the Mississippi in April 1864. He commanded Confederates in Mississippi and Alabama until the end of the war in May 1865.
Taylor died on April 18, 1879 in New York City.

Eastern Theater of the American Civil War

The Eastern Theater of the American Civil War included the U.S. states of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia and the coastal seaports and fortifications of North Carolina. There were many battles fought in this area, especially in northern and eastern Virginia. Several battles were fought between the Union Army of the Potomac and Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. There was so much fighting in Virginia because the Confederate capital was at Richmond, Virginia.
The Eastern Theatre was the scene of several key battles. These included the First Battle of Bull Run, the bloody Battle of Antietam and the greatest battle, the Battle of Gettysburg. Only 100 miles separated the two capital cities, Washington, D.C. the Union capital and the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia. Between the two lay the Shenandoah Valley, a natural corridor that could hide entire armies. 
After the fall of Fort Sumter in April 1861, both sides scrambled to create armies. President Abraham Lincoln issued a call for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion. This immediately caused the secession of four additional states, including Virginia. The United States Army had only around 16,000 men, with more than half spread out in the West. The army was commanded by the elderly Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott, veteran of the War of 1812 and the Mexican-American War. On the Confederate side, only a handful of federal officers and men resigned and joined the Confederacy. The formation of the Confederate States Army was a matter initially undertaken by the individual states.

Japanese idol

An in the Japanese pop culture is a young media personality (a singer, an actor, a model, etc.). This is usually a teenager, who has a cute and innocent public image. Idols are a separate category of Japanese artists.
The term is commercialized by Japanese talent agents. The talent agencies hold auditions for cute boys and girls and make them stars. Idols are intended to be an ideal object of love of frenzied fans. There is also a view that the Japanese people see idols as sisters or girls next door.
Japanese idol singers work across genres of the Japanese pop music. This is usually whatever is most popular at the moment. Their songs do not require great singing skills, but the artist must be beautiful, sweet and nice to sing them. In their everyday life, idols must also match the songs they sing. They must have a perfect public image and be good examples to young people.
The phenomenon appeared in the early 1970s. It was thanks to the popularity of young French actress Sylvie Vartan and the movie she played in called "Cherchez l'idole" ("Look for the Idol"). The movie came out in Japan in November 1964 under the title "Aidoru o Sagase". The term "idol" started being used for girls, mostly between 14 and 16, who were just beginning their path to stardom or for very young new stars.
This is a selective list of Japanese idol music groups, divided by projects or talent agencies.

The Protopopovs

Oleg Protopopov and Ludmila Belousova (often called "The Protopopovs") are former Russian figure skaters. They skated for the Soviet Union. They won Olympic gold medals in 1964 and 1968. They won the World Figure Skating Championships every year from 1965 to 1968.
In 1979, Protopopov and Belousova defected to Switzerland. They became Swiss citizens in 1995. They continued to skate at ice shows and skating exhibitions through their seventies.
Protopopov and Belousova met in Moscow in 1954. They trained in Leningrad.
They competed internationally for the Soviet Union. Their first coach was Igor Moskvin. Their second coach was Petr Orlov. After some disagreements, they left Orlov. They then trained without a coach at a rink in Voskresensk, Moscow Oblast. In 1961, they decided to work with Stanislav Zhuk to raise their technical difficulty.
The Protopopovs' first competition was at the 1958 World Championships. They finished in 13th place. At the 1960 Winter Olympics, they finished in 9th place. In 1962, they won the silver medal at the World Championships. They were the first pair from the Soviet Union or Russia to win a world medal in their sport. They also won silver at the 1962 European Figure Skating Championships. 
The Protopopovs' won their first major international gold medal at the 1964 Winter Olympics. It was the first Olympic pairs gold for the Soviet Union. From this Olympic Games to the 2006 Winter Olympics, only Soviet/Russian skaters won gold medals in pairs skating. That was the longest streak in Olympic history.
The Protopopovs won their first World and European gold medals in 1965. They were the first Soviet/Russian pair to win those. 
They won Olympic gold medals for the second time at the 1968 Winter Olympics. At 32 and 35 years old, they were some of the oldest champions in figure skating.
In 1969 they won the silver medal at the European Championships and the bronze medal at the World Championships. Those were their last major international competitions. They continued to compete within the Soviet Union until 1972. After retiring from competition, they skated in shows into their seventies.
The Protopopovs contributed to the development of pairs skating. They created three kinds of the figure skating move called "death spiral". Dick Button said, "The Protopopovs are great skaters not only because they were the finest of Olympic champions, but also because their creative impact was extraordinary."
Belousova and Protopopov married in December 1957. They are usually called "The Protopopovs", even though Belousova kept her maiden name after their marriage. They decided not to have children because they wanted to keep skating.
On 24 September 1979, Belousova and Protopopov defected to Switzerland while on tour. They applied for political asylum. They settled in Grindelwald. They became Swiss citizens in 1995. Switzerland is still their winter home. Their summer home and training center is in Lake Placid, New York. On 25 February 2003, they went back to Russia for the first time. They were invited by Vyacheslav Fetisov, the Russian Minister of Sport.

Toba catastrophe

The Toba catastrophe was the largest volcanic eruption in the last 2.6 million years. It is called a catastrophe because its effects may have damaged the human species. 
Lake Toba in Sumatra, Indonesia, is the site of a supervolcanic eruption that occurred 73,000 (±4000 years) years ago.
It was a climate-changing event. The eruption was two orders of magnitude (= x100) larger than the largest known historic eruption, that of Tambora, also in Indonesia.
This eruption was the last and largest of four eruptions of Toba during the Quaternary epoch. It had an estimated Volcanic Explosivity Index of 8 (described as "apocalyptic"). It made a sizable contribution to the 100x30 km caldera complex. The mass it threw out was 100 times greater than the largest volcanic eruption in recent history. That was the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia, which caused the 1816 "Year Without a Summer" in the northern hemisphere.
The eruption of Toba led to a volcanic winter with a worldwide decline in temperatures between 3-5 degrees C, and up to 15 degrees C in higher latitudes.
According to the Toba catastrophe theory,it had global consequences, killing most humans then alive and creating a population bottleneck in Central Eastern Africa and India that affected the genetic inheritance of all humans today. 
According to the theory, only 10,000 (perhaps only 1,000) pairs of humans survived the disaster. Perhaps it led to the other hominids becoming extinct, though the Neanderthals certainly survived in Europe and Eurasia. 
There is no direct evidence that the theory is correct. And there is no evidence for any other animal decline or extinction, even in environmentally sensitive species. There is evidence that human habitation continued in India after the eruption. The theory in its strongest form seems to be incorrect.

County Armagh

County Armagh is one of six counties that together make up Northern Ireland. It is also one of the 32 counties of Ireland. County Armagh lies in the north-east of the island of Ireland. The county is 1,326 km² big. About 174,792 people live there.
The county is named after the town Armagh. The name "Armagh" derives from the Irish word "Ard" meaning "high place" and "Macha". In stories, Macha is a goddess of Ireland. Armagh was the main town for the historic Ulaid kings of Ulster.
The landscape has hills in the south. Slieve Gullion is the highest mountain. It goes down from there and becomes flatter with small hills called drumlins in the middle and the west. It is fairly flat in the north, and is at sea level at Lough Neagh. There are a few small islands in the lake.
Ancient Armagh was the territory of the Ulaid people before the year 400. The Red Branch ruled the county. Their capital was a fort called Emain Macha near Armagh. The Red Branch play an important role in the stories in the Ulster Cycle. They are also part of the story the "Cattle Raid of Cooley". 
Armagh was the Roman Catholic home of Saint Patrick.
South Armagh is mostly nationalist. This means that there is a lot of support for the IRA there. 
"Baronies" are old divisions of Ireland. Below is a list of the baronies in County Armagh.
Two major highways run through County Armagh. The M1 links Belfast to Dungannon in the north of the county. The A1/N1 from Belfast to Dublin runs in the far south east. Armagh has lots of local roads connecting the towns and villages.
There used to be many railways in County Armagh, but at the moment there are only a few stations left. 
Ulsterbus is the bus company that runs most public transport in the county. It includes buses from most towns to Belfast. Railway companies Northern Ireland Railways and Iarnród Éireann together run the Enterprise service. It has trains that go to Dublin (about an hour) and Belfast (about forty minutes) a few times daily. There are many more Northern Ireland Railways trains into Belfast and Bangor.
The Ulster Canal and the Newry Canal run through County Armagh. The canals are not fully open for boats to use.

<doc id="449699" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=449699" title="Hyaenodont">
Hyaenodont

The Hyaenodontidae ("Hyaena teeth") is a family of the extinct order Creodonta, which contains several dozen genera.
The Hyaenodonts were important mammalian predators that arose during the late Paleocene and persisted well into the Miocene. They were more widespread and successful than their sister family, the oxyaenids.
They had long skulls, slender jaws, slim bodies, and a tendency to walk on their toes rather than flat-footed (plantigrade). They ranged in size from 30 to 140 cm at the shoulder. "Hyaenodon gigas", the larger species, was as much as 1.4 m high at the shoulder, 10 feet long and weighed about 500 kg, but most were in the 5–15 kg range, equivalent to a mid-sized dog. Fossil evidence of their skulls shows that they had a particularly acute sense of smell, while their teeth were adapted for shearing, rather than crushing.
Their lack of crushing teeth means they could not crush the bones of any but the smallest prey. This contrasts with modern hyaenas, which can crush bones of larger prey. This gives then a good source of calcium, and access to the highly nutritious bone marrow. Modern bears and dogs also have bone-crushing capability, though not to the same extent as hyaenas. Hyaenodonts thus thus lacked dental versatility for processing any foods other than meat.
The carnassials in a hyaenodontid are generally the second upper and third lower molars. However, some hyaenodontids had as many as three pairs of carnassials or carnassial-like molar teeth in their jaws. 
Because of their size range, it is probable that different species hunted in different ways and allowed them to fill many different predatory niches. Smaller ones would hunt in packs during the night like wolves, and bigger, fiercer ones would hunt alone during the daylight, using their sheer size and their mighty jaws as their principal weapon.

<doc id="449710" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=449710" title="Methanogen">
Methanogen

Methanogens are microorganisms which produce methane as a metabolic byproduct in anoxic conditions. They are archaea, a different domain from bacteria. They are common in wetlands, where they are responsible for marsh gas. 
They are also common in the digestive tracts of many animals, such as ruminants and humans. They are responsible for the methane content of belching in ruminants and flatulence in humans. 
In marine sediments methane is produced when sulfates are depleted, below the top layers. Moreover, the methanogenic archaea populations play an indispensable role in anaerobic wastewater treatments. Others are extremophiles, found in environments such as hot springs and submarine hydrothermal vents as well as in the "solid" rock of the Earth's crust, kilometers below the surface. 
Methanogens can convert acetic acid to methane in a fermentation process. Do not confuse them with methanotrophs, which use up methane for their carbon and energy requirements.

Selfie

A selfie is a self-portrait photograph. It is typically taken with a hand-held digital camera or camera phone. 
Selfies are often shared on social networking services such as Instagram, Snapchat, and Tumblr. They are often casual, and are typically taken either with a camera held at arm's length or in a mirror. Some people use a "selfie stick" to hold the camera.
One of the first self-portraits was taken in 1839 by Robert Cornelius, an American photographer. The term "selfie" was first used by photographer Jim Krause in 2005.
A black crested macaque ("Macaca nigra") snatched a camera, and took a photo of herself. The selfie seemed to establish a legal precedent when the Wikimedia Foundation rejected a copyright claim. The ground was that a non-human could not own a copyright, and the camera owner had not taken the photo, and so also could not own the copyright. Therefore the photo was not under copyright.

Tom's Rhinoplasty

"Tom's Rhinoplasty" is the eleventh episode of the first season of "South Park". It was first shown on Comedy Central in the United States on February 11, 1998. The episode was the series' first Valentine's Day episode. It was written by the show's co-creator Trey Parker.
Trey Parker and Matt Stone said that they were originally not happy with the final product and they thought that fans of the show would hate. They were surprised that fans responded positively to it.
When Valentine's Day approaches, Wendy suggests to her boyfriend Stan ways to try and spend time together. After their schoolteacher Mr. Garrison decides to get a rhinoplasty, he introduces their new substitute teacher, Ms. Ellen (voiced by Natasha Henstridge). The boys in class fall in love with her, including Stan, especially when she talks to him. This makes Wendy become incredibly jealous and she warns Ms. Ellen to stay away from Stan, oblivious to the fact that Ms. Ellen does not return Stan's affection. 
When Ms. Ellen becomes worried about the student's education, she says that the winner of a spelling test will be bought a dinner. The boys attempt to date Ms. Ellen but Chef tells them that she is a lesbian and that she only likes other lesbians. They don't know what this means and they try to become lesbians themselves to try and attract Ms. Ellen. They try wearing Birkenstocks, listening to an Indigo Girls album and "licking carpet" (they mistake this for literally licking the carpet floor).
Meanwhile Mr. Garrison's gets a nose job that makes him one of the most attractive men in South Park with his face resembling David Hasselhoff. He decides to quit teaching and try to pursue women. Stan is able to win the spelling test and the dinner but he finds out that Ms. Ellen has no attraction or intention of making love with him. The next day, while Ms. Ellen is teaching the class, several Iraqi men burst through the door and say that she is actually an Iraqi fugitive. She resist her arrest but accidentally kills Kenny by impaling him in the face with a sword. They take her into custody and shoot her into the sun with a rocket. 
Mr. Garrison later becomes a model with great success, but he finds himself being chased throughout the streets by a large group of women and doesn't want the attention. He returns to Tom's Rhinoplasty and regains his original look. Wendy speaks fluent Arabic to a group of Iraqi men and pays them with with a wad of American money. She then watches happily in the sky as the rocket gets blown up in the sun. Kyle realizes that Wendy hired the Iraqi men to murder Ms. Ellen and Wendy says "I told her: 'Don't... fuck... with... Wendy... Testaburger!'" as the episode ends.

Apomorphy

An apomorphy in biology is a derived state, or innovation. For example, amongst mammals, babies can digest their mothers' milk. That is something all mammals share. It is an apomorphy unique to mammals, and so is the production of milk by mammalian mothers.
Apomorphies which are found in every species of a group of animals are the basis of taxonomy. If a group of animals all have a unique apomorphy, the most likely reason is that they descended from a common ancestor. When a group of animals share a large number of apomorphies this becomes a near-certainty. Mammals share a long list of characters which are unique to them.
Clades are identified (or defined) by synapomorphies (from syn-, "together"). These are a group of apomorphies which they all have, but other groups do not. For example, the five digits (fingers and toes) like ours is a synapomorphy within the vertebrates. The tetrapods are the first vertebrates with such digits. Snakes and other tetrapods which do not have digits are tetrapods because other characters, such as amniotic eggs and diapsid skulls, show they descended from ancestors that which had digits.

Crappie

The crappies ( or ) are a genus, "Pomoxis", of North American freshwater fish. They are members of the sunfish family Centrarchidae. Both species in this genus are popular game fish. These are the Black crappie and the White crappie. The White crappie is the state fish of Louisiana.
The genus name "Pomoxis" comes from the Greek πώμα (cover, plug, operculum) and οξύς (sharp). The common name (also spelled croppie or crappé), comes from the Canadian French "crapet," which refers to many different fishes of the sunfish family. Other names for crappie are papermouths, strawberry bass, speckled bass or specks (especially in Michigan), speckled perch, calico bass (throughout New England), "sac-a-lait" (in southern Louisiana, lit. "milk bag", a rendition of Choctaw "sakli") and Oswego bass.
The currently recognized species in this genus are:
Crappies are both preditors and prey. Both species of crappie as adults feed predominantly on smaller fish species. This includes the young of their own predators (which include the northern pike, muskellunge, and walleye). They have varied diets, however, including zooplankton, insects, and crustaceans. By day, crappie tend to be less active and to concentrate around weed beds or submerged objects, such as logs and boulders. They feed especially at dawn and dusk, moving then into open water or approaching the shore.
There are differences between the White and Black crappies. White crappies have 5 or 6 dorsal spines while Black crappies have 7 or 8. White crappies are usually more numerous and tend to be larger. Black crappies appear darker because of the dark spots on its sides. White crappies have black vertical bands on their bodies and are often lighter in color. But the two can be difficult to tell apart unless you count the spines. Crappies are among the most numerous in North American waters. Black crappies begin spawning when the water temperature reaches 60 to 64 degrees Fahrenheit. Females lay between 20,000 and 140,000 eggs. The White crappies begin spawning at water temperatures between 65 and 70 degrees F. The female White crappie lays between 1,000 and 200,000 eggs. Male crappies guard the nest until the eggs hatch, usually in about five days.
The "Pomoxis" species are highly regarded game fishes and are often considered to be among the best-tasting freshwater fish. Because of the variety of their diets, crappies may be caught in many ways. This includes casting light jigs, trolling with minnows or artificial lures. Small spinnerbaits, or using bobbers are also very effective. Crappies are very popular with ice-fishermen, as they are active in winter. The current all-tackle fishing world record for a black crappie is and for a white crappie is .
Angling for crappies is popular throughout much of North America. Methods vary, but among the most popular is called "Spider Rigging," a method characterized by a fisherman in a boat with many long fishing rods pointing away from the angler at various angles like spokes from a wheel. Anglers who employ the Spider Rigging method may choose from among many popular baits, like corn. Many anglers also chum or dump live bait into the water to attract the fish hoping the fish will bite their bait. There are many types of lures that catch crappies. Jigs, especially with a live minnow are very effective. Spoons, Spinners and Crankbaits are all effective at different times.
A commercial fishery for crappies existed at Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee until 2003. It was one of the few commercial fisheries for crappies.

Since then, Higa started composing the music himself. "How to be Gangster" and "How to be Emo" were put back on nigahiga's channel in late August 2009, only to be removed a few days later, along with "How to be Ninja" and "How to be Nerd". In Spring 2010, "How to be Ninja", "How to be Gangster" and "How to be Emo" were made public once more.
Due to Higa Ryan moving to Las Vegas for college, most of the nigahiga videos are solo efforts. They usually feature collaborations with other users.
The nigahiga YouTube channel was created on July 20, 2006 by Higa Ryan, Fujiyoshi Sean, Enos Tim, and Nago Tarynn (known collectively as "The Yabo Crew"). By December 21, 2010, it had reached 3 million subscribers, the first channel to do so. According to Higa, his channel name is a combination of "Niga", which means "rant" in Japanese, and his last name, "Higa".

In 2008, Vleet Van Richard offered to help them create their first feature-length film. The resulting film, "Ryan and Sean's Not So Excellent Adventure", was directed by Vleet Van Richard and released on November 14, 2008. It was shown in sold out theaters in Hawaii and California. The DVD was released on July 14, 2009 in the USA.
"Ryan and Sean's Not So Excellent Adventure" is about a down on his luck movie producer, played by Buckley Michael, who is seeking out famous celebrities in order to make a hit movie in 30 days or risk being fired.

The family's 37 species include many fish familiar to North Americans, including the rock bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, and crappies. All are native only to North America. Family members are distinguished by having from five to 13 dorsal spines number. Sizes of most are in the range. However, some are much smaller, with the black-banded sunfish at just in length, while the largemouth bass is reported to reach almost in extreme cases.
The male of most species builds a nest by hollowing out a depression using his tail, then guards the eggs. Most sunfish are valued for sport fishing. They have been introduced in many areas outside their original ranges, sometimes becoming an invasive species.

Von Neumann architecture

Von Neumann architecture or the von Neumann model is an early computer design description. It was written by mathematician and physicist John von Neumann and others in the "First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC".
It describes a design of an electronic digital computer. There are subsections of a processing unit with an arithmetic logic unit, processor registers, a control unit with an instruction register and program counter, memory to store data and instructions, and input and output devices. 
This means a stored-program computer. It has an "instruction fetch", the step getting the instruction from memory, and a data operation, the instruction actually happening. These cannot be done at the same time because they use the same bus. This limit is called the von Neumann bottleneck. 
These are some examples of von Neumann model computers.
Through the 1960s and 1970s computers became smaller and faster, leading to improvements in the design. This is sometimes called "streamlining" the design. 
The common bus used by the program memory and data memory creates what is called the von Neumann bottleneck, which is the limit of the data transfer rate between the CPU and memory. Because the program and data cannot be accessed at the same time, the data transfer rate is smaller than the rate the CPU can work, limiting the effective processing speed of the CPU. It is made to wait for the data it needs to be moved to or from memory.

Home for the Holidays (movie)

Home for the Holidays is a 1995 comedy-drama movie directed by Jodie Foster. It tells the story of an unhappy family who are getting together for the Thanksgiving holidays. The comedy scene of the Thanksgiving dinner took more than ten days to make. In all, 64 turkeys, 20 pounds of mashed potatoes, 35 pounds of stuffing, 44 pies, 30 pounds of sweet potatoes, 18 bags of mini-marshmallows and 50 gallons of fake wine were used.
Foster let Robert Downey Jr. improvise some of his role instead of using a script. This got him excited about making movies again. He had been unhappy and tired of acting for a while.
Claudia Larson is a single mom with a teenage daughter. Claudia is an artist who restores paintings. She has just lost her job at a museum because of a lack of money to pay her. Even though she is sick with a cold, she flies from Chicago to spend Thanksgiving with her parents, Adele and Henry Larson. They still live in the same house in Baltimore, where she grew up with her sister and brother. But her daughter, Kitt will be staying home to be with her boyfriend. Kitt tells her mom on the telephone that she is going to have sex with her boyfriend for the first time. 
Claudia's stuck-up and critical sister, Joanne Larson Wedman, is also coming for dinner. She brings her boring husband, Walter, and their two spoiled children. Claudia's gay brother, Tommy, and his new friend Leo Fish show up, along with their eccentric Aunt Glady. Claudia laughs and happily chats with Tommy, but the rest of her family is stressing her out, as usual. Meanwhile, Joanne is strictly trying to keep the holiday celebration under control. Tommy has been the boyfriend of another man, Jack, for a long time. So Claudia is confused because he is at dinner with Leo. But, as Claudia finds out, Leo has come along for the holidays to be introduced to Claudia. In fact, Tommy has just recently married Jack. 
The Thanksgiving day has many crazy events, including a loud fight on the lawn in the leaves. The turkey is spilled in Joanne's lap, ruining her fancy dress. Many things are said in anger which can't be taken back and the family seems as divided as ever. So Claudia meets with her family by herself to try to make up. 
Even though Claudia is still discouraged, she becomes close to Leo. When she gets on the plane to go home, Leo goes with her.

Qianzhousaurus

Qianzhousaurus is a genus of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaurs. So far only one species has been named: the type species "Qianzhousaurus sinensis". Nicknamed 'Pinocchio rex' for its long snout in comparison to other known tyrannosaurs, it was discovered in southern China and first published in the journal "Nature Communications" in May 2014. 
Apart from its signature snout, it also had long, narrow teeth, while "T. rex" had thick teeth and powerful, deep-set jaws. This suggest its feeding method and probably its life-style were quite different from "Tyrannosaurus". The thinner teeth and lighter skeleton of "Qianzhousaurus" suggest it hunted smaller creatures, such as lizards and feathered dinosaurs.
The bones were discovered by workmen at a construction site near the city of Ganzhou, who then took them to a local museum.
The discovery of "Qianzhousaurus", and "Alioramus" from Mongolia, shows that the long-snouted tyrannosaurids were widespread in Asia. Although we are only starting to learn about them, they were apparently one of the main groups of predatory dinosaurs in Asia. Their existence was previously suspected because of various scattered fossil finds. An expert says the find "tells us pretty unequivocally that these long-snouted tyrannosaurs were a real thing. They were a different breed, living right to the end of the age of dinosaurs".

Lactation

Lactation describes the secretion of milk from the breasts when a mother feeds her young. It occurs with almost almost all female mammals after the birth of their young. In humans the process is also called "breastfeeding" or "nursing". 
In most species, milk comes out of the mother's nipples. The platypus (a non-placental or monotreme mammal) releases milk through ducts in its abdomen. In only one species of mammal, the Dayak fruit bat, is milk production a normal male function.
Milk production requires the hormones prolactin (PRL) and oxytocin.
The evolution of milk production made use of a feature which was present before modern mammals. The cells which produce milk were developed from the apocrine glands in the skin: 
Meaning: since the skin of synapsids had glands in it, the development of milk production was possible.
Apart from food nutrients, mothers' milk contains a range of antibodies which protect the baby until it develops its own immune system. When born, a baby has IgG antibodies from across the mother's placenta. Its own immunoglobulin production takes about six months to develop after birth, so meantime the mother's milk supplies IgA as a stop-gap protection.

Table Rock Lake

Table Rock Lake is an artificial lake, or reservoir, in The Ozarks of southwestern Missouri and northwestern Arkansas. The lake was made by the construction of Table Rock dam. This 252 foot high impoundment was constructed in 1954-1958 on the White River by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. It is one of the popular attractions for the nearby town of Branson, Missouri. There are several commercial marinas along the lake, and Table Rock State Park is located on the east side. Downstream from the dam, the Missouri Department of Conservation operates the Shepherd of the Hills Fish Hatchery, which is used to stock trout in Lake Taneycomo. The cold water from the dam creates an ideal environment for Rainbow trout and Brown trout.
The lake area temperature varies according to season: 
"Dam and Outlet Measurements"
"Dam elevations above mean sea level"
"Lake elevations above mean sea level"
"Surface area of lake"
"Maximum storage capacity"
"Shoreline length"
"Other"
"Power generating data"
The original purpose of the reservoir was for flood control on the White River. It also produces Hydroelectric power and provides recreation for southern Missoui and northern Arkansas. The dam had been authorized under the Flood Control Act of 1941. But World War II and the Korean War delayed construction until 1954. The reservoir has a fluctuation of . When the reservoir is above the maximum flood pool, excess water goes over the auxiliary overflow spillway at the north end of the dam. Table Rock is the second of four major reservoirs on the White River before it enters the Mississippi River. The other three are Beaver Lake, Lake Taneycomo and Bull Shoals Lake.
Table Rock is one of the premier Largemouth bass fishing lakes in the United States. All three species of Black bass are here in abundance (Largemouth, Smallmouth and Spotted). The lake has produced Largemouth bass of over 10 pounds and Smallmouth bass over 7 pounds. Table Rock is the site of several major Bass fishing tournaments each year. The lake has several other species of game fish including Crappie, Walleye, White Bass, Paddlefish Catfish and Sunfish. Lake Tannycomo, below Table Rock dam, is one of the top 5 Rainbow and Brown trout fisheries in the world.

Lake Taneycomo

Lake Taneycomo is a man-made lake or reservoir on the White River in the Ozark Mountains of Taney County, Missouri. The reservoir is named for the county in which it is located: Taney County, MO. It flows through the city of Branson, Missouri. Tanycomo is the third of four reservoirs on the White River before it enters the Mississippi River. The other three are Beaver Lake, Table Rock Lake and Bull Shoals Lake.
Lake Taneycomo widened out to be a lake with the completion of the Powersite Dam, near Forsyth, Missouri, in 1913. From 1913 until 1958 it was a warm water lake. The United States Army Corps of Engineers completed the Table Rock Dam in 1958. This changed Tanycomo from a warm water lake to a very cold 58 degrees Farenheit (maximum). Gone were the Smallmouth bass the White River was famous for. But it turned Lake Tanycomo into a world class trout fishery. 
In 1957, the Missouri Department of Conservation constructed the Shepherd of the Hills Fish Hatchery. It provides 
between 350,000 and 400,000 pounds of rainbow and brown trout per year, most of which goes into Lake Tanycomo. In 2001, while doing a survey of the lake, Missouri Department of Conservation biologists captured a 36.5 inch long trout they estimated weighed 37 pounds. The trout was promptly released. In 2009, Scott Sandusky, caught the Missouri state record Brown Trout which was 37 inches long and 24.75 inches in girth. It weighed 28.8 pounds and was taken on a spinning rod with 4 pound test line.
Lake Taneycomo is both a river and a lake. The shallow colder water, located near the Table Rock Dam, averages 48 degrees F. Here it resembles a river and allows fishing from the banks of the river. Moving downsteam the temperature of the water gets warmer and the lake deepens to more than near the Powersite Dam in Forsyth. The current can be very strong when Table Rock dam is generating power. The water temperature also drops. At this time the fishing tends to be very good. All methods of trout fishing — fly fishing, fishing lures, and live bait fishing — may be used year-round to catch trout that inhabit the waters of Lake Taneycomo.
Lake Taneycomo offers a variety of recreational activities including hiking, sightseeing, hunting, fishing, boating, and waterskiing. People coming to Lake Taneycomo are able to visit area restaurants, shopping, and shows in the Branson area.

Multiple exposure

In photography, a multiple exposure is when a single frame of film is taken more than once. This usually happens accidentally if the photographer forgets to advance the film. To prevent multiple exposures, most modern cameras will not let the photographer open the shutter again until the film is advanced. It can also be used on purpose for special effects, such as creating a fake photograph of a ghost. The resulting image will be a combination of all of the shots. Multiple exposures are not possible on digital cameras, but the effect can be simulated with the alpha channel feature of photo editing software such as Photoshop or GIMP.

White River (Arkansas)

The White River is a 722-mile (1,162-km) long river that flows through the U.S. states of Arkansas and Missouri.
The source of the White River is in the Boston Mountains of northwest Arkansas, in the Ozark–St. Francis National Forest southeast of Fayetteville. The river flows northwards from its source in northwest Arkansas. It loops up through southwest Missouri into Table Rock Lake at Branson, Missouri. In Branson the river enters Lake Taneycomo, controlled by the Powersite Dam. The Powersite was the first dam on the White River. The flow continues downstream into Bull Shoals Lake. From there it travels back into Arkansas, and then heads generally southeast to where it flows into the Mississippi River. Despite being much shorter than the Arkansas River, it carries nearly as much water—normally more than , and occasionally more than during floods.
Lake Taneycomo was created in 1913 when the Empire District Electric Company built a dam just south of Forsyth, Missouri. Beaver Lake, Table Rock Lake, and Bull Shoals Lake are man-made lakes or reservoirs created by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This was under the authority of the Flood Control Act of 1938. A total of eight dams restrict the upper White River. Six are in Arkansas and two in Missouri. The White River National Wildlife Refuge lies along the lower part of the river. None of the original White River remains in Missouri. It has been replaced by a series of dams that flooded it's valleys. The White River was once known as one of the best Smallmouth bass fisheries in the world. Smallmouth still inhabit the impoundments but trout have replaced the smallmouth in much of the river, as the dams release much colder water.
The tributaries of the White River include Cache River, Bayou des Arc, Little Red River, Black River, North Fork River, Buffalo River, Kings River, James River, and Roaring River. Some cities that lie on the White River are Newport, Augusta, Calico Rock, and Batesville, all in Arkansas, as well as Branson and Hollister in Missouri.
Fishing for trout is popular in the upper portions of the river. This ranges from the Beaver Lake tailwaters in northwestern Arkansas, through its course through southwest Missouri(including all of Lake Taneycomo), and back down through Arkansas. This is to the Highway 58 bridge in Guion. The river has long been ranked one of the top trout fisheries in the United States. Fishing is popular in these waters for a number of trout species including rainbow, brown, and cutthroat trout. A number of trout fishing resorts lie on the tailwaters of Bull Shoals Lake and the North Fork River. Fishing for white bass is also popular in these waters.

Forsyth, Missouri

Forsyth is a city in Taney County, Missouri, United States. The population was 2,255 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Taney County. It was incorporated as a village on 15 December 1890. Forsyth is located on what was the White River, now Lake Taneycomo.
At the beginning of the American Civil War, Forsyth was occupied by Confederate forces. On 22 July 1861, Brigadier General Sweeney and 1,200 Union troops with artillery forced the Rebels out. Rebel forces withdrew from Forsyth but returned as soon as the Union troops left. In January 1863, the Union Army moved back into Forsyth, where they remained for several months. It took the ferry on the White River eight days to carry all the troops, supplies, horses and wagons across the river. Because of the Confederate threat, Union troops used logs from the town's houses to fortify their defenses. On 22 April 1863 Union forces left Forsyth, but set the town on fire to make sure that their fortifications did not fall into Rebel hands. When the fires died out all that remained of Forsyth was the burned-out shell of the big brick courthouse. The courthouse was eventually rebuilt. On 19 December 1885 the courthouse was totally destroyed along with all official records of the county and those of the only county newspaper. A new Taney County courthouse would not be constructed until 1890. On 15 December 1890 the village of Forsyth was incorporated. On 4 November 1891 the county court leased a room in the new courthouse to the first bank in Taney County, the new Taney County Bank, for the sum of $2.00 per month. 
In the late 1940s plans were being made in Washington, D.C. that would directly affect Forsyth. A dam (Bull Shoals) was to be built on the White River, approximately 80 miles below Forsyth. Two choices were left for the town; it could move to a new location or cease to exist. The city limits of Forsyth were extended 2 miles west of the old town site (now called Shadow Rock Park) to an area that had once been a golf course. In the early 1950s the town of Forsyth was moved to this location.

Smallmouth bass

The smallmouth bass ("Micropterus dolomieu") is a species of freshwater fish. They are in the sunfish family (Centrarchidae) of the order Perciformes. It is the type species of its genus. One of the black basses, it is a popular game fish sought by anglers throughout the temperate zones of North America. they have been spread by stocking to many cool-water tributaries and lakes in Canada and the United States. The smallmouth bass is native to the upper and middle Mississippi River basin, the Saint Lawrence River–Great Lakes system, and up into the Hudson Bay basin. Its common names include smallmouth, bronzeback, brown bass, brownie, smallie, bronze bass, and bareback bass.
The smallmouth bass is generally brown (seldom yellow) with red eyes, and dark brown vertical bands. There are 13–15 soft rays in the dorsal fin. The upper jaw of smallmouth bass extends to the middle of the eye. Males are generally smaller than females. The males tend to weigh around two pounds. Females can range from three to six pounds. Their average sizes can differ, depending on where they are found. Those found in American waters tend to be larger due to the longer summers, which allow them to eat and grow for a longer period of time. Their habitat plays a significant role in their color, weight, and shape. Smallmouth that live dark water (such as rivers) tend to be rather torpedo-shaped and very dark brown. Smallmouth bass that live in sandy areas of lakes, tend to be a light yellow-brown and are more oval-shaped.
The smallmouth bass is found in clearer water than the largemouth, especially streams, rivers. They also prefer rocky areas, stumps, and also sandy bottoms of lakes and reservoirs. Smallmouth prefer cooler water temperatures than its cousin the Largemouth bass, and may be found in both still and moving water. Because it does not like pollution, the smallmouth bass is a good natural indicator of a healthy environment. Carnivorous, its diet comprises crayfish, insects, and smaller fish. Smallmouth fry feed on zooplankton and other aquatic life. But they will readily feed on their smaller siblings. 
The female lays from 1,000 to 6,000 eggs per pound of her body weight. The male creates a nest, usually in deeper water than the largemouth and larger than that of the largemouth. He then guards it chasing off the female so other females can lay their eggs in his nest. The fry hatch in a day or two, depending on water temperature. From that point they are on their own and leave the nest area quickly.
In the United States, smallmouth bass were first introduced outside of their native range with the construction of the Erie Canal in 1825, extending the fish's range into central New York state. During the mid-to-late 19th century, smallmouth were transplanted via the nation's rail system to lakes and rivers throughout the northern and western United States, as far as California. Shippers found that smallmouth bass were a hardy species that could be transported in buckets or barrels by rail, sometimes using the spigots from the railroad water tanks to aerate the fingerlings. They were introduced east of the Appalachians just before the Civil War, and afterwards transplanted to the states of New England.
With increased industrialization and development, many of the nation's eastern trout rivers were nasty, polluted, or allowed to silt up, raising water temperatures and killing off the native brook trout. Smallmouth bass were often introduced to northern rivers now too warm for native trout, and slowly became a popular game fish with many anglers. Equally adaptable to large, cool-water impoundments and reservoirs, the smallmouth also spread far beyond its original native range. Later, smallmouth populations also began to decline after years of damage caused by pollution. They were also affected by the loss of river habitat caused by damming many formerly wild rivers to form lakes or reservoirs. In recent years, a renewed emphasis on preserving water quality and riparian habitat in the nation's rivers and lakes, together with stricter management practices, eventually benefited smallmouth populations. and has caused a resurgence in their popularity with anglers.
Today, smallmouth bass are very popular game fish. They attract anglers using conventional as well as fly fishing tackle. The smallmouth bass is one of the toughest fighting freshwater fish in North America. In addition to wild populations, the smallmouth bass is stocked in cool rivers and lakes throughout Canada and the United States. In shallow streams, it is a wary fish, though usually not to the extent of most trout. The smallmouth is highly regarded for its topwater fighting ability when hooked. Old fishing journals referred to the smallmouth bass as "ounce for ounce and pound for pound the gamest fish that swims". Smallmouth bass are taken for the table, with filets of white, firm flesh when cooked. Today, many fishermen practice catch and release fishing to improve fish populations.
The current all-tackle world record for a smallmouth bass is 11 lb 15 oz, caught by David Hayes in the Dale Hollow Reservoir, on the Kentucky/Tennessee border, in 1955.
In conventional fishing, smallmouth may be successfully caught on a wide range of natural and artificial baits or lures. These include crankbaits, hair jigs, plastic jerkbaits, spinnerbaits, and all types of soft plastic lures, including curly tail grubs or tubes with lead head jigs. They may also be caught with a fly rod using a dry or wet artificial fly, nymphs, streamers, or imitations of larger aquatic creatures, such as hellgrammites, crawfish, or leeches. Floating topwater popper fly patterns and buzz baits are also popular for smallmouth fishing.
For river fishing, spinning tackle or fly tackle is usually the most popular angling tools for smallmouth in North America.

Miracle fruit

The miracle fruit is the berry of Synsepalum dulcificum, a plant from West Africa. The chemical produced by the fruit makes other food taste sweet. This chemical, called miraculin, is now being produced by transgenic tomato plants. Miraculin is a glycoprotein molecule, with some trailing carbohydrate chains.
The berry has a low sugar content and a mildly sweet taste. When the fruit is eaten, miraculin binds to the tongue's taste buds, causing sour foods to taste sweet. At neutral pH, miraculin binds and blocks the receptors, but at low pH (after eating sour food) miraculin binds protons and activates the sweet receptors. This is what causes the sweet taste. This effect lasts until the protein is washed away by saliva (up to about 60 minutes).

Thyroid-stimulating hormone

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (also known as thyrotropin, or TSH) is a hormone which stimulates the thyroid gland. 
The thyroid gland secretes thyroid hormones, which control how fast the body's chemical functions go (the metabolic rate). Thyroid hormones influence the metabolic rate in two ways: by stimulating almost every tissue in the body to produce proteins and by increasing the amount of oxygen that cells use. Thyroid hormones affect many vital body functions.
Thyrotropin is a glycoprotein hormone synthesized and secreted by thyrotrope cells in the anterior pituitary gland, which adjusts the endocrine function of the thyroid gland.

Fish hatchery

A fish hatchery is where fish are hatched and cared for, usually to be released in natural waters (rivers, lakes, etc.). They may also be transferred to Fish farms and raised for food. Fish hatcheries and farms (also called aquaculture) are either commercial or run by a state, province, or country. Some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include Pacific oysters, shrimp, prawns, salmon, tilapia and scallops. In the United States in particular, many species of game fish are raised in hatcheries. These include black bass, trout, walleye, Northern pike, and Muskellunge.
The value of global aquaculture production is estimated to be US$98.4 billion in 2008 with China significantly dominating the market. However, the value of aquaculture hatchery and nursery production has yet to be estimated.

Histamine

Histamine is an organic nitrogenous compound involved in local immune responses. It also regulates physiological function in the gut, and acts as a neurotransmitter. Histamine is involved in the inflammatory response, where tissues get red, swollen and painful.
As part of an immune response to foreign pathogens, histamine is produced by basophils and by mast cells found in nearby connective tissues. Histamine increases the permeability of the capillaries to white blood cells and some proteins. The cells get through the walls of the tiny blood vessels to get at pathogens in the infected tissues.
Histamine in water exists as two tautomers in equilibrium, differing by the position of the nitrogen atom:

Game fish

Game fish are fish that are popular to catch for sport by fishermen (anglers). They can be freshwater fish or saltwater fish. Game fish can be eaten after being caught, though increasingly anglers practice catch and release to improve fish populations. Some game fish are also caught commercially, for example salmon.

<doc id="450311" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=450311" title="Catch and release">
Catch and release

Catch and release is a practice in sport fishing for conservation of the various species. Once caught, the fisherman carefully and quickly removes the hook from the fish's mouth. Then, without causing any harm, returns the fish alive to the water. Weighing and measuring of the fish, if done, are often done in the water. Using barbless hooks, it is often possible to release the fish without removing it from the water (a slack line is frequently sufficient).
Catch and release is an ethical decision by fishermen but it is not for every situation. the Snakehead fish, for example, is an invasive species. It is illegal in many places to return them to the water. The Muskellunge is a highly prized game fish in many places. But, in a few places it is seen also as an invasive species and should not be returned to the water. 
Debates continue over the practice of catch and release. In Canada, many First Nations peoples feel strongly that fish should only be taken as needed for food. That "playing with the fish" is not showing proper respect. Sportsmen point out that catch and release is respectful since they take only what they need and release the rest. 
Animal protection advocates have raised concerns about the possible suffering of fish caused by angling. A fish hooked in the gills or stomach usually has a very high Mortality rate. Hooks with no barbs or using hooks that dissolve in a short time (and are not removed from the fish) minimize harm to fish. But catch and release exposes a fish to being caught several times by multiple fishermen. Handling a fish several times may not be good resource management or humane. 
Even sportsmen have raised concerns over catch and release. The argument is that once caught, a fish is no longer wild. Who would want to catch the same trout others have caught? 
But the practice remains popular among many fishermen and among fish and game department biologists. Those in favor of catch and release quote Lee Wulff: "A trout is too valuable to be caught only once." Studies on the mortality of released fish shows a very low rate of from 2 to 5 percent—when caught on artificial lures. When using live bait, the mortality rate is about 50 percent. This indicates that using artificial bait is a strong part of catch and release.

Largemouth bass

The largemouth bass ("Micropterus salmoides") is a freshwater game fish in the sunfish family, a species of black bass native to North America. It is also known by a variety of regional names, such as the brown bass, widemouth bass, bigmouth bass, black bass, bucketmouth, Potter's fish, Florida bass, Florida largemouth, green bass, green trout, gilsdorf bass, linesides, Oswego bass, southern largemouth and northern largemouth. But, it is not a member of the bass family but actually a member of the Sunfish family. The largemouth bass is the state fish of Alabama (official freshwater fish), Georgia, Mississippi, Florida (state freshwater fish), and Tennessee (official sport fish).
The largemouth is an olive green fish, marked by a series of dark, sometimes black, forming a jagged horizontal stripe along each side. The upper jaw (maxilla) of a largemouth bass extends beyond the rear margin of the eye. In comparison to age, a female bass is larger than a male. The largemouth is the largest of the black basses. The largest reached a maximum recorded overall length of and a maximum unofficial weight of . The fish lives 16 years on average.
The juvenile largemouth bass eats mostly small bait fish, scuds, small shrimp, and insects. At about a year of age they become cannibalistic, eating other largemouths their size or smaller. As they mature they no longer consume their own kind. Adults consume smaller fish such as gizzard shad, fathead minnows and bluegills. These are swallowed head first. crustaceans such as crayfish are swallowed tail first. Largemouths can consume other fish up to 50% of their own length. sunfish and crustacean they eat tend to be no more than 35% of their own length. They will eat almost anything they can find in the water—snakes, mice, young waterfowl, birds and shrimp.
In larger lakes and reservoirs, adult bass occupy deeper water than younger fish. They shift to a diet consisting almost entirely of smaller fish like shad, yellow perch, ciscoes, shiners, and sunfish. Largemouth also consume younger members of larger fish species, such as pike, catfish, trout, walleye, white bass, and striped bass. The largemouth bass uses its senses of hearing, sight, vibration, and smell to attack and seize its prey. Adult largemouth are generally apex predators within their habitat, but they are preyed upon by many animals while young.
Largemouth bass are widely sought after by anglers and are noted for the excitement of their fight. The fish will often jump out of the water in their effort to throw the Fishing hook. Anglers most often fish for largemouth bass with lures such as plastic worms (and other plastic baits), jigs, crankbaits and spinnerbaits. A recent trend is the use of large swimbaits to target trophy bass. Live bait, such as nightcrawlers, minnows, frogs, or crawfish can also be productive. Many bass anglers practice catch and release, especially the larger specimens. This is because larger specimens are usually breeding females that contribute heavily to future sport fishing stocks. Largemouth bass, if handled with care, respond well to catch and release.
The world all-tackle record largemouth bass was caught by George Perry in Montgomery Lake in Georgia in 1932. It weighed 22 pounds and 4 ounces. In 2009 a 22-pound, 4.97 ounce largemouth was caught in Japan by Manabu Kurita. By International Game Fish Association (IFGA) rules, a record fish of under 25 pounds must beat the previous record by 2 ounces or more to be a new record. The IFGA considers the two fish to share the current world record. However, the largemouth caught by George Perry in 1932 still holds the Georgia state record.

Megazostrodon

Megazostrodon is an early proto-mammal, discovered in Lesotho, southern Africa. 
It is one of the first mammals, and appeared in the fossil record about 200/205 million years ago (mya). It did have some non-mammalian characteristics, but overall this animal, and "Morganucodon", probably show the final stage of the transition between the cynodonts and true mammals.
It is thought that the animal was nocturnal as it had a relatively much larger brain than its cynodont relatives, and the enlarged areas of its brain were found to be those which process sounds and smells. 
Nocturnal activity in an animal of this size virtually requires an increased internal production of heat.
From their size and teeth, "Megastrozodon" were probably insectivores, as were all its relatives at the time. Their small size suggests some kind of temperature regulation, which in turn suggests insulation in the form of fur. 
The night-time behaviour and insectivorous habits gave these early mammals a niche which did not compete with the reptiles. 
These early mammals developed many traits which made them well-suited for an active lifestyle. They developed four types of teeth. There is evidence that the inward-closing movement of the mandible suggests a shearing action to chew food. Their skeletons changed so that their limbs were more flexible (they became less laterally splayed, allowing for faster forward motion) and they developed a shorter ribcage and larger lungs to allow for faster respiration. The structure of their jaw bones changed, the lower jaw becoming a single bone — the dentary. The other bones which once made up the jaw moved to the middle ear to create a hearing system.

Spotted bass

The spotted bass ("Micropterus punctulatus") also called the Kentucky Bass, is a freshwater game fish in the sunfish family. It is a species of black bass native to the lower and central Mississippi River basin in North America. It has been introduced into other U.S. states as far west as California. It has also been introduced into other countries. The spotted bass is often confused with the largemouth bass because it has the same coloring. But it is distinguished by having a smaller mouth than the largemouth. In size it is smaller than either the largemouth or smallmouth bass. In 1956 it became the official game fish of Kentucky. From that time on it was popularly called the Kentucky bass.
Currently there are three recognized subspecies of spotted bass.
In addition there are reports of hybrid spotted bass occurring naturally. This is between largemouth and spotted bass—the offspring of which are difficult to identify as either species.
The spotted bass is a fish with a slender body marked by black on its side. As the fish matures these become an irregular band. Their color ranges from a light green to light brown. Unlike the largemouth, the tongue of the spotted bass has a patch of teeth. Their gill covers also have a large dark spot on them. The Alabama spotted bass is distinguished by a dark spot on the tail in addition to the one on each gill cover. The Northern spotted bass has a tail spot, but the gill spot is not as distinct. The average size is four to five pounds. The IFGA world record is 10 pounds 4 ounces. 
Unlike the largemouth bass, the spotted bass seems to like current (moving water). They can tolerate warmer water than largemouths and do well in streams and rivers. They can also thrive in southern reservoirs that have gravel and rock bottoms. Like it's better known cousins, the spotted bass is carnivorous. It will eat prey from the bottom to the surface of the water. If available it will feed primarily on crayfish. It also preys on minnows, catfish, and insects.
At spawning the male makes from one to four nests and defends them until the females lay their eggs. Females lay fewer eggs than largemouth or smallmouth bass. But once the eggs are deposited in the nest, she will remain to help guard the nest for another day before leaving. The male then guards the nest(s) against Bluegills and other raiding fish. They continue to guard the fry after hatching. Unlike other black basses, spotted bass tend to group together and form schools. They are sometimes seen chasing schools of shad in open water.
Many spotted bass are caught by accident by fishermen seeking largemouth or smallmouth bass. They are found in streams and rivers like smallmouth, although they cannot tolerate water as cold. They also cannot tolerate the low oxygen saturation in warm water that largemouths can. Otherwise they live in the same waters. The spotted bass is a strong fighter, once hooked, much like the smallmouth. Unlike either of their cousins they do not tend to jump from the water. The same lures that attract other black bass also attract spotted bass. But their strong preference for crayfish makes any lure that resembles a crayfish very effective. In mid-summer, fishing in reservoirs, spotted bass can be as deep as 100 feet. Fishermen need to get their lures deep enough to attract the spotted bass.

Kodkod

The kodkod is the smallest cat in the Americas, found in Chile and Argentina. Its scientific name is "Leopardus guigna", and it is sometimes called the güiña. They are closely related to the other small cats of South America, such as the Ocelot and the Margay.
Kodkods live in mixed temperate rainforests of the southern Andes. They also live in the coastal forests of Chile, which have bamboo in the understory of the forest. They prefer evergreen temperate rainforests. They are tolerant of altered habitats, and are found in secondary forest and shrub as well as primary forest, and on the fringes of settled and cultivated areas.
Kodkods are active during the day and night, but they only go into open ground under the cover of darkness. During the day, they rest in dense vegetation in ravines, along streams with heavy cover. They are excellent climbers, and easily able to climb trees more than a meter in diameter. They are terrestrial predators of birds, lizards and rodents in the ravines and forested areas.
Male kodkods maintain exclusive territories in size, while females occupy smaller ranges of just .

The Second inauguration of Bill Clinton as the 42nd President of the United States, took place on January 20, 1997. It was the last inauguration of a president in the 20th century, 
Reverend Billy Graham gave an invocation to start the ceremony followed by the Pledge of Allegiance. Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States Ruth Bader Ginsburg gave the oath to office for Vice President Al Gore. Jessye Norman, the famed Georgian opera singer, then serenaded the crowd with a medley of patriotic songs. After the performance, surrounded by members of Congress dignitaries, Justices of the Supreme Court, family, and friends, Bill Clinton stood next to his daughter while his wife held the Bible. The oath to office was administered by Chief Justice William Rehnquist at 12:05 pm. The oath was ended with the traditional words, “So help me God.” The National Anthem was sung and then Arkansas poet Miller Williams read “Of History and Hope,” a poem he wrote for the event.

Margay

The Margay ("Leopardus wiedii") is a spotted cat native to the Americas. It is a solitary and nocturnal animal which prefers remote parts of the rainforest. 
The margay is mostly nocturnal. It eats small mammals (sometimes including monkeys), birds, eggs, lizards and tree frogs. The margay is able to hunt its prey entirely in trees. However, they do sometimes hunt on the ground, and have been reported to eat cane rats and guinea pigs.
There is a report of a margay using sound mimicry to lure a prey. A margay was seen to imitate the call of an infant pied tamarin while in the presence of a group of adult tamarins. This caused the adults to investigate. Although the margay was not successful in catching a monkey, this was the first observation of a Neotropical predator using this type of mimicry.
Margays are mainly nocturnal, but they do sometimes hunt during the day. They prefer to spend most of their life in the trees, but also travel across the ground, especially when moving between hunting areas. During the day, they rest in safe branches or clumps of lianas.
Like most cats, they are solitary: the adults usually meet only to mate. They have large home ranges of . They use scent to mark their territory (urine spraying) and leave scratch marks on the ground or on branches. Their vocalisations are short range: they do not call to each other over long distances.
The margay is one of only two cat species with ankles flexible enough to climb head-first down trees. The other is the clouded leopard; the little-studied marbled cat may also have this ability. 
The margay is very agile; its ankles can turn up to 180 degrees, it can grasp branches equally well with its fore and hind paws, and it is able to jump up to horizontally. The margay has been seen to hang from branches with only one foot, and can run upside down beneath branches.
Although once thought to be vulnerable to extinction, the IUCN now lists it as only "near threatened". It roams the rainforests from Mexico to Argentina. Actually, it is a successful and widespread species. It has ten subspecies over a large geographical range from Mexico to Argentina. Its past range even included the southern United States.
They are hunted mainly for their fur and this has resulted in a large population decrease - around 14,000 are killed a year. They also suffer from a loss of habitat, which is also a significant part of this decline.

Oasis, Missouri

Oasis was a village in Taney County, Missouri, in the Ozark Mountains. Originally it was named Cedar Valley. Oasis currently rests under 100 feet of water near the bottom of Table Rock Lake. The underwater village is a popular technical dive for scuba divers.
Oasis was a small outpost located on Long Creek south of Branson, Missouri. It had dirt roads and fewer than 10 buildings in the whole village. Oasis also had a three story mill with a mill dam, and a general store. The store was also the local polling place for the surrounding community. 
The village was originally named Cedar Valley. Is not certain when the name was changed to Oasis. But the the name Oasis reflected the picturesque ("pretty as a picture") scene of a small farming community. In 1935 Oasis had all of 21 residents. From the big red mill there were roads going south into Arkansas. Other roads went north into other parts of Missouri. Originally Long creek had two fords nearby. Taney county built a bridge near the mill at a cost of several thousand dollars. But the bridge didn't go anywhere. One end had no access road. The other end was built up against a steep hill. There were no funds to build a road to the bridge. Nor were there funds to blast out a road from the rock on the other side. So it remained unused for 10 years. Finally the roads were finally built. The one-lane bridge was connected to Highway 86.
In the 1930s and 1940s, the idea came up to dam the White River (Arkansas). This was to generate hydroelectric power. The reservoir created by the dam would serve also for flood control on the White River. The dam was authorized under the Flood Control Act of 1941. But World War II and the Korean War delayed construction until 1954. Construction on the Table Rock dam was completed in 1958. It created an impoundment that flooded nearly 79 miles of the White River. It created a lake of over 50,000 acres. Oasis now sits under 100 feet (30m) of water. The church, mill, and other buildings were covered by the lake. The church cemetery was moved to the new Cedar Valley Church on U.S. Route 65.
Advanced divers can dive down to Oasis and swim up and down the main street. Parts of the old wood church are still there as are foundations of several buildings. While Table Rock is deep, it is not murky like typical lakes. Underwater visibility is good, making scuba diving a popular sport in the lake.
Table Rock State Park has a Dive shop at the marina. Table Rock is also used for dive training by over 15 area dive shops. Other attractions in the lake include the 'Enchanted Forest', a forest of submerged oak trees full of very large bass. There are shipwrecks that are frequently dived on. One is the the 'Zebulon Pike', a twin-deck riverboat. Not far from the dock of the Branson Belle, lies a 40-foot (12 m) cruiser. There are numerous smaller wrecks throughout the lake. Classes for search and recovery divers are also held here.

General store

A general store, (also called a 'general merchandise store', 'general dealer' or 'village shop') is a rural or small town store that carries a very general selection of merchandise. The store is often a small space. It is where people from the town and surrounding rural areas come to purchase staple food items such as milk and bread. Also the various other goods, dry goods and hardware homes and farms might need. It sometimes served as a village or town meeting place where neighbors exchanged news and gossip. The concept of the general store is very old, and although some still exist, there are far fewer than there once were, due to urbanization, urban sprawl, and the relatively recent phenomenon of big-box stores.

The leopard cat ("Prionailurus bengalensis") is a small wild cat of South and East Asia. Since 2002 it has been listed as least concern by IUCN. It is widely distributed, but habitat loss and hunting occurs in places. There are twelve leopard cat subspecies, which differ widely in appearance.
The small cat is not closely related to the leopard. Its leopard-like spots gave it the name.
Leopard cats are the most widely distributed Asian small cats. Their range extends from the Russian Far East, Korea, China, Indochina, the Indian subcontinent, northern Pakistan, the Philippines and the Sunda islands of Indonesia. 
They prefer forested habitats, but are found in agriculturally used areas. They live in tropical evergreen rainforests and plantations at sea level, and in subtropical deciduous and conifer forests in the foothills of the Himalayas above .
The highest altitudinal record was at in the Kanchenjunga Conservation Area.
In the northeast of their range they live close to rivers, valleys and in ravine forests, but avoid areas with more than of snowfall. They are rare in Pakistan’s dry treeless areas. In Afghanistan, they were reported in the 1970s from Jalalkot and Norgul in the Kunar Valley, and the Waygul forest of Dare Pech.

The Montgomery Bus Boycott was a major event in the Civil Rights Movement. It occurred in Montgomery, Alabama where the city buses were segregated. Black passengers were required by law to ride in the back of the bus. On December 1, 1955 Rosa Parks, an African American woman, refused to give her bus seat to a white person. She was arrested and sent to jail. In protest about 40,000 black people boycotted the Montgomery city buses, refusing to ride. The boycott lasted 381 days. On November 13, 1956, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision to desegregate the buses. In response the city of Montgomery passed a law allowing black passengers to sit anywhere on the buses. The boycott ended on December 20, 1956. Many important people in the civil rights movement took part in the boycott. This included Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. and Ralph Abernathy.

Turbidity

Turbidity is a measure of how well light penetrates water. It is caused by particles (total suspended or dissolved solids) that are generally invisible to the naked eye. The measurement of turbidity is a key test of water quality.
Fluids can contain suspended particles of many different sizes. Some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom if a liquid sample is left to stand. Very small particles settle very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are colloidal. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid or murky.
Turbidity in open water may be caused by growth of phytoplankton. Naturally occurring Algal blooms can cause turbidity. Human activities that disturb land can lead to high sediment levels entering water bodies during rain storms due runoff. These can include construction, mining and agriculture. pollution from paved surfaces such as roads, bridges and parking lots is another source. Certain industries such as quarrying, mining and coal recovery can generate very high levels of turbidity from rock particles entering the water.
In drinking water, the higher the turbidity level, the higher the risk that people may develop diseases. Contaminants like viruses or bacteria can become attached to the suspended solids. The suspended solids interfere with water disinfection with chlorine because the particles act as shields for the virus and bacteria. Similarly, suspended solids can protect bacteria from ultraviolet (UV) sterilization of water.
In water bodies such as lakes, rivers and reservoirs, high turbidity levels can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths. This can limit growth of submerged aquatic plants. In turn this affects species which are dependent on them, such as fish and shellfish. High turbidity levels can also affect the ability of fish gills to absorb dissolved oxygen. This situation has been regularly observed throughout the Chesapeake Bay in the eastern United States.

iOS 6 is the sixth major version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS. It was released on September 19, 2012, and the latest version is iOS 6.1.6.
Until now, it is still running on about 11% of devices (the percentage including devices that are not supported) besides iOS 7's 87% (including non-supported devices) and the last 2% (including non-supported devices) are for older iOS versions.
iOS 6 was shown during Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2012 on June 11, 2012. This software dropped support for older devices such as the third generation iPod Touch and the first generation iPad following the cycle of past iOS versions. It is supported on the iPhone 3GS and later, the fourth generation iPod Touch and later, the iPad 2 and later, and the iPad Mini.
On September 12, 2012, at San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, the iPhone 5, the fifth generation iPod Touch, and the final release of iOS 6.0 were revealed at the event. It was announced that iOS 6 would be released on September 19, 2012.
The iPhone 5 had iOS 6 already installed, but other devices will need to get it installed as an over-the-air update or through iTunes. An iTunes update, version 10.7, was released on September 12, 2012, and it was needed in order to install iOS 6 on a device.
Unlike past iOS versions, two apps that were removed as part of iOS 6 were Google Maps and YouTube. These apps can be downloaded for free in the App Store.
The all-new Maps application uses a different engine that helps to get rid of lag and make for smoother zooming. It also adds turn-by-turn directions and 3D views in some cites.
In iOS 6, the Google Maps application was replaced with Apple's own maps. It caused many poor reviews, with information that is not complete, maps that are not correct, no support for transit maps, and low-quality satellite images.
The iOS 6.1 update released on January 28, 2013 had reports of reduced battery life and issues with signal strength.

Simple harmonic motion

The amplitude is the biggest distance from the fixed point. The period is the time taken to get back to the same point again (with the same speed and in the same direction).
The equations of simple harmonic motion can be found by looking at a fixed wheel with radius formula_1 that is spinning with steady speed formula_2 radians per second. The time formula_3 taken for one complete turn is formula_4 formula_5 because there are formula_6 radians in a full circle.
Imagine a white spot painted on the rim of the wheel. If it starts level with the axle, and the wheel has turned through an angle formula_7 in time formula_8 seconds, then the height formula_9 of the spot above the axle is given by formula_10 (where formula_11 means the sine of the angle turned, and trigonometry is used to find the height).

Mr. Popper's Penguins (movie)

Mr. Popper's Penguins is a 2011 American comedy family movie. It was directed by Mark Waters, and stars Jim Carrey. It was loosely based on the children's book of the same name. The movie was released on June 17, 2011.
Thomas "Tom" Popper has a job buying and selling properties. He gets news that his father has died during an adventure to Antarctica. Popper's lawyer tells him he will inherit a souvenir from his father's last adventure. 
A crate arrives at Popper's front door, with a gentoo penguin (Captain) inside. Soon, because of confusion with a crew member, five more penguins arrive: (Bitey, Stinky, Lovey, Nimrod, and Loudy). Popper wants to donate all six penguins to a pest control company. But his children, Janie Popper and Billy Popper, think that the penguins are Billy's birthday present. Mr. Popper meets with a zookeeper, Nat Jones, who also wants the penguins. Popper asks him to collect the penguins another time. Jones agrees, but he warns that the conditions in Popper's apartment are not good enough to raise penguins.
At the same time, Popper is given the task of buying "Tavern on the Green", where he used to eat with his father as a child. He wants to tear it down and building a new development in its place. However, its elderly owner, Selma Van Gundy, refuses to sell it to him. She does not like his plan.
The penguins soon lay three eggs. Two of the eggs hatch and one doesn’t. Popper loses his job while waiting for the last egg to hatch. He has made his bosses angry for not focusing on the tavern for them. Jones sneaks in the apartment one night and warns him that penguins can only survive in the cold or zoo and vows to get the penguins sometime. Popper puts snow in his apartment, and lowers his temperature for the penguins in an attempt to help. Finally, realizing that the egg can’t be hatched, Popper sadly donates all the pigeons to Jones for the New York zoo. He then is re-hired by his bosses, and refocuses his attention on purchasing the Tavern on the Green. His family is not happy. The next day his ex-wife decides to travel to Africa for three weeks with her boyfriend Rick, and leaves the kids in his care. 
Popper finds a lost letter from his father, which had been sent with the first penguin, Captain. In it, his father tells him to love his children, just as this penguin would love him. Having a change of heart, Popper asks his children and ex-wife to help him get the penguins back from the zoo before his ex-wife goes to Africa and he sells the tavern.
Popper and his family ask Jones about getting the penguins back, but Jones refuses. He lies and says they have been traded to other zoos. But Popper discovers that Jones is lying with help from the shouting penguin named Loudy. He frees the penguins from a cooler in the office and locks Jones inside. While escaping, Popper and his family notice that Jones has managed to get free and security guards are looking everywhere for them. Popper and his family manage to escape with the penguins and flee to the tavern with Jones in pursuit on a golf-cart. 
After seeing how Popper had reunited his family and rescued the penguins, Van Gundy sells him the restaurant. But rather than tear it and the park down, Popper orders that the restaurant be renovated and reopened. Immediately after Van Gundy makes the deal with Popper, Jones arrives with the police to arrest Popper for theft of the penguins. After explaining the story in front of the crowd and police, the officers agree to spare Popper from prison if they can find out who the penguins love. Jones holds up a sardine for the penguins, thinking they love fish more than Popper, but the penguins go to Popper instead. The crowd applauds for Popper. Jones gets hysterical and angry, so police officers arrest Jones instead. 
Popper and his family travel to Antarctica with the penguins, allowing them to live with their own kind and promising to visit on occasions. Popper's first penguin, Captain, is revealed to have laid another egg. Popper tells his children that they'll have to come back and visit when the baby, who he named Bald Eagle, is born.
Originally, Ben Stiller was supposed to play Mr. Popper, and Noah Baumbach was originally going to direct, but they dropped out. Owen Wilson, Jack Black, and Jim Carrey were all considered to replace Stiller, with the role eventually going to Carrey. Mark Waters was chosen to direct. 
On September 21, 2010, it was confirmed that Carla Gugino joined the cast as Tom's ex-wife Amanda Popper.
The musical score was ambitious, with music playing nearly throughout. It was written by Rolfe Kent, and orchestrated by Tony Blondal. It was recorded at the scoring stage at 20th Century Fox in Century City, Ca. with a 78 piece orchestra.
An online Museum Slide Game created by designer Mark Kavanaugh as promotional material for the film is still accessible.
The film earned $6.4 million on opening day and $18.4 million over the three-day weekend, ranking in third place behind "Green Lantern" and "Super 8". The opening was at the high end of 20th Century Fox's expectations, which was predicting a mid to high teens opening. In its second weekend, the film faced competition from "Cars 2" and dropped 45% to $10.1 million and ranked in fifth place. Over the four-day Independence Day holiday weekend, it ranked in eighth place after dropping 34% to $6.7 million. The film has earned $68,224,452 domestically and $119,137,302 in foreign countries, grossing a total of $187,361,754 worldwide.
The film has received mixed reviews from critics, with a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 48%, based on 136 reviews, as of August 2012. The consensus reads "Blandly inoffensive and thoroughly predictable, Mr. Popper's Penguins could have been worse—but it should have been better." It was released in Blu-ray and DVD on December 6, 2011 along with "The Help", "The Debt", "Cowboys & Aliens", and "The Hangover Part II".
"Mr. Popper's Penguins" was released on Blu-ray and DVD on December 6, 2011. It includes a short film called "Nimrod and Stinky's Antarctic Adventure".

My dad is a concert promoter and he’d get me into the events. I remember being backstage and meeting “Stone Cold” [Steve Austin], Triple H, Chyna and Trish [Stratus] as a kid, so it’s really funny to me that I ended up here.

Bergmann's rule

Bergmann's rule is an ecogeographic principle. It states that, within a widely distributed group of animals, the larger ones are found in colder environments, and the smaller ones are found in warmer regions. 
So, for example, with bears the largest member is the polar bear, and the smallest members are found in subtropical areas (panda). The largest tiger is the Siberian tiger. Large mammals of the late ice age were in general larger than their descendants today.
The rule is named after nineteenth-century German biologist Carl Bergmann, who described the pattern in 1847, though he was not the first to notice it. Bergmann's rule appears to hold true for many mammals and birds, but there are exceptions. 
Although originally put in terms of species, it seems to apply to populations within a species. Bergmann's rule is most often applied to mammals and birds which are endotherms, but some researchers have also found evidence for the rule in studies of ectothermic species. 
In addition to being a general pattern across space, Bergmann’s rule has been reported in extinct populations from the fossil record. In particular, reversible dwarfing of mammals happened during two extremely warm but rather brief times in the Palaeogene.

Fishing cat

The fishing cat ("Prionailurus viverrinus") is a medium-sized wild cat of South and Southeast Asia. Fishing cats are the largest of the "Prionailurus" cats. They are about twice the size of a domestic cat and have a stocky, muscular build with medium to short legs. 
In 2008, the IUCN classified the fishing cat as "Endangered". They live in wetland habitats, which are increasingly being settled, degraded and converted. Over the last decade, the fishing cat population throughout much of its Asian range declined severely.
Like its closest relative, the leopard cat, the fishing cat lives along rivers, streams and mangrove swamps. It is well adapted to this habitat, being an eager and skilled swimmer. Its feet are partly webbed, and it does catch fish.

Cove

A cove is a small type of bay or coastal inlet. Coves usually have narrow, restricted entrances. They are often circular or oval, and are often found in a larger bay. Small, narrow, sheltered bays, inlets, creeks, or recesses in a coast are often considered coves. The term can also be used to describe a valley between two mountain ridges. Coves are formed by differential erosion. Differential erosion occurs when softer rocks are worn away faster than the harder rocks around them. These rocks further erode to form a circular bay with a narrow entrance called a cove.

Laplace operator

In mathematics the Laplace operator or Laplacian is a differential operator given by the divergence of the gradient of a function on Euclidean space. It is usually denoted by the symbols ∇·∇, ∇ or ∆. The Laplacian ∆"f"("p") of a function "f" at a point "p", up to a constant depending on the dimension, is the rate at which the average value of "f" over spheres centered at "p", deviates from "f"("p") as the radius of the sphere grows. In a Cartesian coordinate system, the Laplacian is given by the sum of second partial derivatives of the function with respect to each independent variable. In other coordinate systems such as cylindrical and spherical coordinates, the Laplacian also has a useful form.
The Laplace operator is named after the French mathematician Pierre-Simon de Laplace (1749–1827), who first applied the operator to the study of celestial mechanics. In this case, the operator gives a constant multiple of the mass density when it is applied to a given gravitational potential. Solutions of the equation ∆"f" = 0, now called Laplace's equation, are the so-called harmonic functions, and represent the possible gravitational fields in free space.
The Laplacian occurs in differential equations that describe many physical phenomena, such as electric and gravitational potentials, the diffusion equation for heat and fluid flow, wave propagation, and quantum mechanics. The Laplacian represents the flux density of the gradient flow of a function. For instance, the net rate at which a chemical dissolved in a fluid moves toward or away from some point is proportional to the Laplacian of the chemical concentration at that point; the resulting equation is the diffusion equation. For these reasons, the Laplace operator is used in the sciences for modelling all kinds of physical phenomena. In image processing and computer vision, the Laplacian operator has been used for various tasks such as blob and edge detection.

Bull Shoals Lake

Bull Shoals Lake is an artificial lake or reservoir. It is in the Ozark Mountains of northern Arkansas and southern Missouri. Bull Shoals has hundreds of miles of lake arms and coves. This makes it good for boating, water sports, swimming, and fishing. Nineteen developed parks around the shoreline. These provide campgrounds, boat launches, swim areas, and marinas.
Bull Shoals Dam was created to impound (hold water in a reservoir) the White River. Bull Shoals has one of the largest concrete dams in the United States. It was the 5th largest dam in the world when the project was started. Work on the dam began in 1947 and was completed in 1951. In 1952 it was dedicated by President Harry S. Truman At least seven small family cemeteries and 20 larger cemeteries were carefully moved to make room for the new lake.
Bull Shoals Lake is the last reservoir on the White River before it enters the Mississippi River. The other three are Beaver Lake, Table Rock Lake and Lake Taneycomo. Bull Shoals lake is controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers and has the primary purpose of flood control. The level of the lake changes regularly. The normal pool level elevation is 654 feet above sea level, which is locally known as 'powerpool'. However, the elevation changes between 630 and 680 feet.
The upper part of the lake, below nearby Powersite Dam, is known as the "Pothole". The dam is designed for a maximum elevation of 695 feet (top of the flood pool). Bull Shoals Lake covers 45,000 acres (182 km²) with a 700-mile (1,120-km) shoreline at powerpool. It expands to more than 70,000 acres (284 km²)with a 1,000-mile (1,600-km) shoreline at 690 feet. The bottom of the lake consists of bedrock with very little vegetation. The shoreline of the lake is protected by a buffer zone (locally called the 'take line'). This area is owned, managed, and controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers. There is very little development around Bull Shoals. Most of the shoreline is heavily forested.
The Bull Shoals-White River State Park is a 725-acre (2.9 km²) park in Baxter and Marion Counties of Arkansas. It lies both above and below the large dam. Facilities, including camping, pavilions, docks and a nature center, stretch along the banks of the White River. The park offers 103 riverside campsites and 20 tent sites. Two rent-a-camp and two rent-a-RV sites are also available. Picnic areas and pavilions are scattered throughout the park. There are trails through the surrounding woods. A marina contains boating equipment and also rents boats. The visitors' center offers programs, workshops, camps, boating and fishing exhibits and an aquarium. Tours of the power generation plant and other dam facilities are available for a fee.
Table Rock is one of the premier Largemouth bass fishing lakes in the United States. The best time for bass fishing is between March and May. This is when the bass spawn in the shallows. Bull Shoals Lake is Arkansas's largest lake, and is also well known as a trout hot spot. Rainbow trout and brown trout of record size have been caught in the lake, with bream, catfish, crappie and largemouth bass also plentiful. Swimming and other watersports are also welcome at the lake. Arkansas Highway 178 runs along the top of Bull Shoals Dam and into the park.
Record rainfall in the spring of 2008 caused Bull Shoals to reach its highest water level since 1957. The lake crested at 695.02 feet above sea level. The Army Corps of Engineers opened the floodgates to stop the lake from more flooding.

Wave equation

Equations that describe waves as they occur in nature are called wave equations. Waves as they occur in rivers, lakes, and oceans are similar to those of sound and light. The problem of having to describe waves arises in fields like acoustics, electromagnetics, and fluid dynamics.
Historically, the problem of a vibrating string such as that of a musical instrument was studied by Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Leonhard Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, and Joseph-Louis Lagrange. In 1746, d’Alambert discovered the one-dimensional wave equation, and within ten years Euler discovered the three-dimensional wave equation.

Platonic love or platonic relationship means a close relationship between two people that is not sexual. In the modern use it has generally been used to mean a non-sexual relationship between heterosexual friends. The term is named after the philosopher Plato. He was the first to describe this kind of love. Plato calls this his theory of "erôs" (meaning "love"). He describes this philosophy in his dialogues "the Phaedrus" and "the Symposium". Like many in his society, Plato was most interested in the same-sex relationships between older and younger men. But his theory can apply to other kinds of erotic relationships as well. Platonic love includes a sexual desire that is overcome by a stronger desire and appreciation for friendship.

Emil Kraepelin used the term to describe, and contrasted it with the mental illness called Bipolar disorder. People with bipolar disorder often have episodes in which they seem normal, which people with "dementia praecox" do not.
This theory could not be proved. In 1911, Eugen Bleuler said that "dementia praecox" was actually schizophrenia. The word Schizophrenia was not uaed widely before 1925.

"Champagne Supernova" is the sixth and final single off English rock band Oasis' second studio album "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?". The song was released on 13 May 1996.
In an interview, lead guitarist Noel Gallagher said of the song:
"Some of the lyrics were written when I was out of it. There's the words: 'Someday you will find me/ Caught beneath a landslide/ In a Champagne Supernova in the sky'. That's probably as psychedelic as I'll ever get. It means different things when I'm in different moods. When I'm in a bad mood being caught beneath a landslide is like being suffocated. The song is a bit of an epic. It's about when you're young and you see people in groups and you think about what they did for you and they did nothing. As a kid, you always believed the Sex Pistols were going to conquer the world and kill everybody in the process. Bands like The Clash just petered out. Punk rock was supposed to be the revolution but what did it do? Fuck all. The Manchester thing was going to be the greatest movement on earth but it was fuck all. When we started we decided we weren't going to do anything for anybody, we just thought we'd leave a bunch of great songs. But some of the words are about nothing. One is about Bracket The Butler who used to be on Camberwick Green, or Chipley or Trumpton or something. He used to take about 20 minutes to go down the hall. And then I couldn't think of anything that rhymed with 'hall' apart from 'cannonball'. so I wrote 'Slowly walking down the hall/ Faster than a cannonball' and people were like, 'Wow, fuck , man'. There's also the line 'Where were you while we were getting high?' because that's what we always say to each other. But the number of people who've started clubs called Champagne Supernova is fucking unbelievable. And the album isn't even released yet."

His younger brothers, Charles IV of Spain and Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies replaced him in the succession. When his father became King of Spain in 1759, Philip remained in Naples where he lived until his death from smallpox at the age of thirty. He was given the title of Duke of Calabria as heir to the throne.
Named after his grandfather Philip V of Spain, he was expected to succeed to the Spanish throne at his fathers death. By birth he was an "infante" of Spain as well as a prince of the kingdoms of Sicily and Naples. He was the heir to one of the largest collection of former Italian states.

Arctic char or Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, is a cold water fish in the family Salmonidae. It is native to Arctic, sub-Arctic and alpine lakes. It breeds in fresh water. Char may either be landlocked or anadromous, migrating to the sea. No other freshwater fish is found as far north. It the only fish species in Lake Hazen on Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic. It is one of the rarest fish species in Britain.found only in deep, cold, glacial lakes, and is at risk from acidification. In other parts of its range, such as Scandinavia, it is much more common, and is fished extensively. It is also common in the Alps, (particularly in Trentino and in the mountain part of Lombardy). Char are also found in Iceland. In Siberia, it is known as "golets". The Arctic char is a relative of both salmon and lake trout. It shares traits with both. The char's color depends on the time of year and where it lives. The back is usually dark brown or olive green. On its sides it has dark spots on a light background. The color can be gold, brown, red, or orange. At spawning the fins and belly become bright red or orange.

Dolly Varden

The Dolly Varden ("Salvelinus malma") is a species of salmonid. It is native to cold-water tributaries of the Pacific Ocean in Asia and North America. In the past it has been mistaken for a species of trout. Dolly Varden are in the genus "Salvelinus" of true chars. They are covered with light spots on a dark background (trout have dark spots on a light background). They may either be landlocked or anadromous (meaning they migrate to the sea). The coloring depends on their environment. Those that travel to the sea (anadromous) are dark blue on the head, back and upper sides. Freshwater (or landlocked) Dolly Varden are brown to olive green on the head, back and upper sides. The belly is light colored. They feed on aquatic insects, other fish and their eggs.
Dolly Varden was the name of a fictional character in an 1841 Charles Dickens novel. She was known for liking brightly colored dresses. At that time very colorful women's dresses were called "Dolly Vardens". Livingston Stone noted that in 1872 fishermen on the McCloud River in California were calling the brightly colored fish they caught "Dolly Varden" after the dresses. But there were no Dolly Varden in the McCloud river. They may have been catching its near relative the Bull Trout. In spite of the mistake the name stuck for 'Salvelinus malma'.

It will eat nearly anything but can go long periods without food. It can eat other fish that are half it's own length.Lake trout can live from 25 to 40 years. Lake trout spawn eight to ten years in a row. The female produces 1,000 eggs for every kilogram she weighs. The largest Lake trout ever caught was in Canada and weighed 121 pounds. Other names for it include mackinaw, lake char (or charr), touladi, togue, and grey trout. In Lake Superior, it can also be variously known as siscowet, paperbelly and lean. The lake trout is prized both as a game fish and as a food fish.

The porcupine caribou or Grant's caribou ("Rangifer tarandus granti") is a subspecies of the caribou. They are found in Alaska and parts of Canada. It resembles the subspecies, barren-ground caribou ("R. t. groenlandicus"), and is sometimes included in it.
Migratory caribou herds are named after their birthing grounds. In this case it is the Porcupine River, which runs through a large part of the range of the Porcupine herd. The herd has been losing numbers in recent years. In 1989 they numbered about 178,000. The estimates for 2010 numbered them at about 169,000. They migrate over a year between their winter range and calving grounds on the Beaufort Sea. It is the longest land migration route of any land mammal on earth. Their range spans across the Alaska/Yukon border. They are jointly managed by Alaska, Canada and local Native American peoples. They are important food for the Gwichʼin. They are a First Nations/Alaska Native people, who traditionally follow the caribou. The herd is also routinely hunted by other peoples, including the Inupiat, Inuvialuit, Hän, and Northern Tutchone.

Boston Mountains

The Boston Mountains area is a high and deeply dissected plateau. They are located in northern Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma. The Oklahoma portion of the range is locally called the Cookson Hills. The rocks of the region are sedimentary layers of the Paleozoic age. The highest ridges and peaks are capped by Pennsylvanian sandstone and shale. The deeply eroded valleys are cut into Mississippian limestones and below that layer Ordovician dolomites.
The Boston Mountains form the southwestern part of the Ozark plateau. They are the highest and most rugged part of the Ozarks. This is because of their young age relative to the other sections. The highest point is 2,578 feet. It has valleys 500 to 1,550 feet deep. Turner Ward Knob (TWK) is the highest named peak. It is in western Newton County, Arkansas and rises to .
The Boston Mountains are the source of several rivers and streams. They flow out from the mountains in all directions. The Boston mountains are the sources of the White River, the Buffalo River, the Kings River and War Eagle Creek. Other rivers and streams having their headwaters in the Boston Mountains include the Illinois River, the Mulberry River, Lee Creek, Frog Bayou, Big Piney Creek, Illinois Bayou, and the Little Red River.

Gryphaea

Gryphaea (the Devil's toenail) is a genus of extinct oysters which were once very common. Their fossils are common on the Jurassic Coast in southern England, and in the margins of the old Sundance Sea in the United States. It is a marine bivalve mollusc in the family Gryphaeidae. 
These bivalves were at their peak in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, when they sat in huge muddy oyster beds in shallow tropical seas. The genus survived a long time, but went extinct about 34 million years ago (mya). 
The oyster shell has two 'valves': a larger gnarly-shaped shell (the 'toenail') and a smaller, flattened shell, the 'lid'. The soft parts of the animal lived in the gap between the two shells, just like modern oysters. The shells have prominent growth bands. The large curved shell sat in the mud on the sea floor. 
In England at the coasts of Redcar and Weymouth in the Kimmeridgian clay; in the U.S.A in riverbanks and cliffs of Texas and Kansas. They are often washed out of the clay onto the beach or river banksides.

Old-growth forest

An old-growth forest (also called primary forest, virgin forest, primeval forest, late seral forest, or in Britain, ancient woodland) is a forest that has reached a great age without much disturbance.
It has unique ecological features, and might be classified as a climax community. Old-growth features include various tree-related structures. These provide wildlife habitats which increase the bio-diversity of the forested ecosystem.
Usually old-growth forests have multi-layered open canopies. They also include varied tree heights and diameters with fallen logs on the forest floor. In Europe less than 7% of forests are old-growth, mainly due to industrial logging in the 20th century. In the United States estimates are that only 10% of old-growth forests remain. In Asia old-growth forests are sometimes lost in regional conflicts.

Joan Castejón

Joan Ramón García Castejón, Elche, (December 17, 1945), known as Joan Castejón is a Spanish draftsman, painter and sculptor, considered one of the leading representatives of social realism in the Spanish postwar plastic renewal of the 70s and 80s. Member of the Grup d'Elx.
His work has been exhibited in some of the most important museums in Spain, among others, the Institut Valencià d'Art Modern (IVAM), the Museum of the University of Alicante, Guerricabeitia Martinez Collection at the University of Valencia, Miguel Hernández University of Elche, the Bancaja Foundation Center, Centre of the Carmen Valencia, and the Museum of Contemporary Art of Elche.
At sixteen he moved to Valencia, where he received training in the fine arts at the Academy of San Carlos. His first solo exhibition is held in the Valencian art gallery Mateu in 1966. This first moment of his career (1964-1967) can be described as neofigurative. The human figure (sometimes grouped) appears in the middle of undefined spaces. Works from this stage, including anthropomorphic themed drawings, announce the peculiar features that characterize his later works.
That momentum of his career was cut short, however, by the traumatic time in prison tafter taking part in the demonstrations of May 1967 in Valencia against Francoist regimen. After standing up for a friend who was being brutally beat, a plainclothes agent arrested Castejón. He received several beatings that night and short after that was sentenced to six years in prison. Until mid 1969 remains in prisons of Valencia and Teruel. That year became part of the Grup d'Elx in its second stage, participating in their exhibitions until 1971. On these facts, re-enters the prison in the Canary Islands during seven months of 1971. While in prison he draw around two thousand drawings with wax or pencil, and define another specific stage of production.
Castejón marries Paca Galván and in 1973 returned to Valencia where he briefly rejoins the local art scene, but a year later he settled permanently in Dénia. Takes up painting. Explicit and shocking expressionism during this decade of the seventies. Later in the 80s explores a brighter abstraction inspired by the landscape. Theatrical virtuoso drawing dominates the 90s. Human being has become the central poetics reference of his work. 
In 1999 he was appointed Adopted Son of Dénia, the city where he lives since 1974.
If there is one aspect that stands out in the work of Joan Castejón is his exceptional drawing skills, a palpable mastery also in his painting and leading to write to José Manuel Caballero Bonald "the artist draws a classic and meditate as a prophet". The author and official historian of Alicante Enrique Cerdan Tato wrote in El Pais on the work of Castejón: " ... he wanted to express the universe of man revealed by violence".
On leaving prison he painted a series of one hundred works inspired by the work of Gabriel García Márquez One Hundred Years of Solitude, which exposes in Valencia and Barcelona. Mario Vargas Llosa wrote on this occasion about Castejón's art: "So one of the most interesting aspects of this collection of pictures of Castejón show that even today the art of painting can, without abandon modernity, have the literature as a starting point. Like a woman, a dream, or a crime, a novel can be for an artist a creative ferment... " 
Artur Balder writes, in relation to the work of Castejón, that "an indispensable condition of the Gesamtkunstwerk, with a base of either visual, literary, or musical representation, is its timeless condition, its ability to withstand the test of time itself by rising instead of sinking into the spasm of momentary fashion, and perish with it a few years, and only to be seen in that context, as in a narrow place of history. However, Castejón, next to the absolute hero in its representation of humanism, can be attributed, as an artist, as Juan Gil-Albert described, "in whose light the depths of so looming giant men, that I was forced to retain breath and meditate." 
Martí Dominguez published in the pages of El País around drawing skills in the art of Castejón: "Any exaggeration is objectionable, and to say that Joan Castejón is possibly the best Spanish artist who by now dominates human anatomy may seem a excess, but it is not." 
His exhibition "Per a Paca" visited many cities in Alicante between 2009 and 2010 as a tribute to his wife. According to the newspaper La Verdad it was "a retrospective of historical memories of the couple." 
The largest public collection of works by Castejón is gathered at the Museum of Contemporary Art in his hometown Elche. The largest private collection was the collection Lecasse Foundation in Alcoy, containing about two hundred works acquired by businessman Lionel Grau Mullor during the eighties and nineties. Currently this collection was divided among his heirs. The collection of drawings dedicated to Don Quixote belong to the IVAM. Another good part of Parts is in the collection of Foundation Bancaja, Valencia.

James River (Missouri)

The James River is a river in southern Missouri. Its source is near the town of Diggins in Webster County. It begins on a northwesterly course, then turns southwest near Northview. It passes down the east side of Springfield where a dam creates Lake Springfield. From Springfield, it flows west and then south to Galena. Shortly after Galena it enters Table Rock Lake. Before the dam that created Table Rock Lake, the James River emptied into the White River. 
Large sections of the James River are used by canoes or kayaks. A solid 3-day float from the spillway below Lake Springfield to Galena is possible when the levels are high enough. There are several access points along the river. These offer a variety of amenities including fishing and boat rentals. 
The James River is not a water source for the city of Springfield. However, Springfield Lake is a primary source of water for the cooling system at the Southeast Power Plant which sits by the dam. James River Freeway on the city's south side is named after the river. The river's unusual green stain is from copper-fixing bacteria present in the waters.

High Chaparral Theme Park

High Chaparral is a Wild West theme park and museum, close to Värnamo, Sweden. It features cultural artifacts and collectibles. It opened in 1966, founded by Bengt Erlandson, more commonly known as 'Big Bengt'.
Big Bengt was born in 1922 in Brännehylte, Småland. His parents owned a forest farm and a wood mill. Big Bengt was involved in starting over 1000 companies. His interest in the Wild West was born from coming from a countryside where many had emigrated to America and from the stories they told. Bengt went to the United States himself in 1956 and in 4 months covered 4000 km. He came back to Sweden with a lot of impressions. When the Swedish national phone company had to get rid of 200,000 telephone poles, Bengt took the opportunity and constructed a fort. When many people started to get curious about the place, he realized its possibilities. 
The park was opened in 1966. It stages several stunt shows a day. It also has a steam train that runs through the park. There is both the classic Wild West section, an Indian themed area, a Mexican themed area, and a museum overflowing with cultural artifacts, old cars, machinery, and various Cold War oddities such as the bronze monster-size statue of Lenin expelled from Nowa Huta.

Compassion

Compassion is the response to the suffering of others that motivates a desire to help.
Compassion motivates people to go out of their way to help physical, spiritual, or emotional hurts or pains of another. In Latin "compassion" means "co-suffering." More involved than simple empathy, compassion commonly gives rise to an active desire to relieve someone's suffering. Pity and compassion are closely related words but have subtle differences. The difference is that compassion usually involves some commitment to help. Pity does not usually require any personal involvement.

Gideon Algernon Mantell MRCS FRS (Lewes, 3 February 1790 – London, 10 November 1852) was an English obstetrician, geologist and palaeontologist.
Mantell's work on the structure and life of "Iguanodon" began the scientific study of dinosaurs. In 1822 he was responsible for the discovery (and the eventual identification) of the first fossil teeth, and later much of the skeleton, of "Iguanodon". 
Mantell's work on the Cretaceous of southern England was also important. His phrase the "Age of Reptiles" was significant. He recognised that reptiles were the dominant life-form in what we now call the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
Mantell did two things which were most important. He showed that the teeth of "Iguanodon" meant it must be a herbivore, and its shorter front legs meant it could be bipedal (walk on two legs). This was denied by Richard Owen, who did a good deal to hide Mantell's achievements.
At the end of Mantell's life he suffered terribly from damage to his spine caused by an accident. He took an overdose of opium, which caused his death. It is not known whether he did this deliberately; he took opium to dull the pain.
Sixty-seven books and memoirs appear in Agassiz and Strickland's "Bibliographia Zoologiæ", and forty-eight scientific papers in the Royal Society's Catalogue.

William Buckland DD FRS (12 March 1784 – 14 August 1856) was an English theologian who became Dean of Westminster. He was also a geologist and palaeontologist.
Buckland wrote the first full account of a fossil dinosaur, which he named "Megalosaurus". He proved that Kirkdale Cave in Yorkshire had been a prehistoric hyena den, for which he was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society. He was praised as an example of how scientific analysis could reconstruct events from the distant past. He was a pioneer in the use of fossilized faeces (he coined the term coprolites) to reconstruct ancient ecosystems.
In 1818, Buckland was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He became Reader in Geology at Oxford University in 1819. His work "Reliquiæ Diluvianæ" was published in 1823 and became a best seller. 
However, over the next decade Buckland changed his mind. In his famous Bridgewater Treatise, "Geology and mineralogy considered with reference to natural theology", he said that the biblical account of Noah's flood could not be confirmed using geological evidence. What had been taken as evidence of the 'Universal Deluge' two decades before was, he thought, evidence of a major glaciation.
Not only was Buckland's home filled with specimens – animal as well as mineral, live as well as dead – but he claimed to have eaten much of the animal kingdom, a practice known as zoöphagy.

Oxygen saturation

Oxygen saturation or dissolved oxygen (DO) is a relative measure of the amount of oxygen that is dissolved in a given medium. It can be measured with a dissolved oxygen such as an oxygen sensor. Or it can be measured with an optode in liquid media, usually water. The standard unit is milligrams per litre (mg/l) or parts per million (ppm). Fish, invertebrates, plants, and aerobic bacteria all require oxygen (dissolved in water) for respiration. In medicine, oxygen saturation refers to "oxygenation". This means when oxygen molecules () enter the tissues of the body.

When the Civil War started, Rosecrans rejoined the army. He became a Brigadier general in May 1861. He commanded a brigade during the Western Virginia Campaign. He commanded the Union units in West Virginia for a while before being transferred to the Western Theater in May 1862.
In October 1862, Rosecrans became commander of the Army of the Cumberland. His first battle as army commander was at the Battle of Stones River from December 31, 1862 to January 2, 1863. The Union army won the battle. During the summer of 1863, Rosecrans then captured the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee. But he lost the Battle of Chickamauga in September, which forced him to retreat to Chattanooga. The Confederates surrounded the city and started a siege. Union president Abraham Lincoln and Major General U.S. Grant, who commanded all Union armies in the Western Theater, didn't think Rosecrans could defend the city. So Rosecrans was fired as commander of the Army of the Cumberland and sent to Missouri.
Rosecrans resigned from the army again in 1867 and went back into business. In 1881 he was elected to the House of Representatives from California. He died in 1898 in California. Rosecrans has a national cemetery in San Diego, California named after him.

Kashmir Valley

The Kashmir Valley (Urdu: وادی کشمیر) or Vale of Kashmir is a valley between the Karakoram and the Pir Panjal Range. It was formed by the draining of the huge Karewa lake during a period of tectonic uplift. The Mughal Emperor Jahangir (1569–1627) called the Kashmir Valley a "paradise on earth". It is now in the Indian administered state of Jammu and Kashmir. There are 10 districts in this administrative division. The valley is about long and wide.
It was called "Kaspeiria" by the ancient Greeks. In classical literature Herodotus calls it "Kaspatyrol". Xuanzang, the Chinese monk who visited Kashmir in 631 AD called it "Kia-shi-mi-lo". Tibetans called it Khachal, meaning "snowy mountain". It is and has been a land of rivers, lakes and wildflowers. The Jhelum River runs the entire length of the valley. The valley is d by snow-capped mountains on all sides. Lakes such as Dal Lake and nearby Nagin Lake have hundreds of houseboats. This is from the British Raj era when s were not allowed to buy land here. So they constructed large wooden houseboats to spend the summers in. This, in turn, has led to houseboat hotels. Many are decorated with wood s and Victorian era furniture. 
India and Pakistan fought over the region in 1947–1948. Under the supervision of the United Nations the two agreed on a ceasefire along a line which left the Kashmir Valley under the administration of India. In 1972, India and Pakistan sign a peace treaty called the Simla Agreement. It said that in the future both would settle their differences peacefully. It also renamed the ceasefire line the Line of Control. 
India claims the entire state including the Kashmir Valley to be part of India. Both the United States and the United Kingdom support turning the Line of Control into the border between India and Pakistan. India seems to go along with this while Pakistan is entirely against it.
India has sent large security forces to Kashmir over the years. Kashmir has remained one of the world's most militarized areas. In 1989 there was an armed uprising against Indian control. India blamed Pakistan and accused them of sponsoring terrorism.
In 1999 a third conflict arose over the area. Pakistani-backed forces infiltrated into Kashmir. While both armies have fired across the Line of Control, India has not sent troops into Pakistan. Tens of thousands of people have been killed so far in Kashmir.
The majority of the population in the Kashmir Valley is Muslim. The economy is mainly farming but in recent years tourism has become an important industry. Neither India or Pakistan wants full-scale war (both have nuclear weapons). Neither wants the international sanctions that would surely come if there was a war.

<doc id="451499" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=451499" title="Lake Anna">
Lake Anna

Lake Anna is one of the largest freshwater inland lakes in the US state of Virginia. It covers an area of 13,000 acres (53 km²). Lake Anna is 72 miles (116 km) south of Washington, D.C. in Louisa and Spotsylvania counties. The lake is easy to get to from Richmond and Charlottesville. Lake Anna is one of the most popular recreational lakes in the state.
In 1829 gold was discovered in Louisa county. In the 1880s gold mining reached its peak. The Goodman gold mine is the site that later became Lake Anna. The reservoir is formed by the North Anna Dam on the North Anna River at . In 1968, Virginia Electric and Power Company (now Dominion) purchased 18,000 acres (73 km²) of farmlands in three counties along the North Anna and Pamunkey Rivers. They planned to provide clean, fresh water to cool the nuclear power generating plants at the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station next to the lake. By 1972 the lake bottom was cleared of all trees and the dam was almost finished. It was thought it would take three years to completely fill the lake. But with the additional rainfall from Hurricane Agnes, the lake was full in only 18 months. The first communities were started at about that same time. Now there are about 120 different communities on the shores of the lake. In March 1986, construction on the dam's 1 megawatt hydroelectric power plant began. The two generators went into commercial operation in December 1987.
Lake Anna is about long from tip to tip. It has some 200 miles (300 km) of shoreline. The lake is divided into two sides: the public side (also known as the "cold" side) and the private side (also known as the "hot" side). The public side is roughly 9,000 acres (36 km²), while the private side is roughly 4,000 acres (16 km²). The private side is formed of three main bodies of water, connected by navigable canals. The public and private sides are divided by three stone dikes. The private side has no marinas or public access ramps. Only property owners and North Anna Power Station employees have access to the waters of the private side. The public side has several marinas and boat launches, including a boat ramp at the state park. The public side sees much higher boat traffic than the private side, especially on summer weekends.
The public side is called the "cold" side because it provides water to cool the generators at the power plant. The private or "hot" side receives warm water discharge from the power plant. The private side can be much warmer than the public side, especially near the discharge point. There it can be too hot for swimming. The private side has an extended water sports season. Some water circulates back out of the private side into the public side through underground channels. As a result the public side is warmer in the southern area near the dam. In the winter, some fish move to these warmer waters.
Plans for an addition of a third reactor have raised protests from environmentalists and property owners. They fear it will increase in the water temperature and lower the water level, particularly on the private side. According to Dominion, the water discharged from the plant is usually about 14 degrees F warmer than the intake water.
The dam creating the lake, North Anna Dam, is a long and high earthen embankment dam. It is wide at its top which sits at an elevation of above sea level. The dam's spillway is located in the center of its body. Normal elevation for the reservoir is . The dam's hydroelectric power plant is located on the west side of the spillway. It is supplied with water via a diameter penstock. It has a combined installed capacity of 1 MW.
Lake Anna is one of the finest Largemouth bass fishing lakes in Virginia. Besides largemouth, there are striped bass, crappie, channel catfish, walleye and several species of sunfish. Because of the warm water and low Oxygen saturation the striped bass have to be stocked in Lake Anna. The walleye population has a similar problem and must also be stocked. Lake Anna has very good numbers of channel catfish, with many averaging 3 pounds. Because of the warm waters, Lake Anna can be fished all year long. It is a very popular recreational lake that offers boating, Water skiing and Jet Skiing. As a result, Lake Anna gets "very" crowded. Fishermen resort to early morning and late night fishing when all the other users are off the lake.

Tenrec

The tenrec is a mammal of the family Tenrecidae, found on Madagascar and in parts of the African mainland. 
Tenrecs are varied. As a result of convergent evolution, they look like hedgehogs, shrews, opossums, mice and even otters. They occupy aquatic, arboreal, terrestrial and underground habitats. Some of these species can be found in the Madagascar's dry deciduous forests.
Although they may resemble shrews, hedgehogs, or otters, they are not closely related to any of these groups. Their closest relatives are other African, insectivorous mammals such as golden moles and elephant shrews. The common ancestry of these animals, together with aardvarks, hyraxes, elephants, and sea cows in the group Afrotheria, was not recognized until the late 1990s. Work on the diversity of afrotherian mammals has provided more support for their common ancestry.
Unusual among placental mammals, the anus and urogenital tracts of tenrecs share a common opening, or cloaca, a feature more commonly seen in birds, reptiles, and amphibians. They have low body temperatures, sufficiently so that they do not require a scrotum to cool their sperm as most other mammals do.

Golden mole

Golden moles are small, insectivorous burrowing mammals native to southern Africa. They form the family Chrysochloridae. They are taxonomically distinct from the true moles. They look alike because of convergent evolution. 
The golden moles bear a remarkable resemblance to the marsupial moles of Australia. They live almost exclusively underground, beneath grassland, forest, swamps, deserts, or mountainous terrain. Like several other burrowing mammals with similar habits, they have short legs with powerful digging claws, very dense fur that repels dirt and moisture, and tough skin, particularly on the head. Their eyes do not work, and covered with skin and fur. The ears are just tiny openings and, like the marsupial moles, they have an enlarged leather-like pad to protect their nostrils. Their main sense is that of touch, and they are particularly sensitive to vibrations that may indicate approaching danger.

Battle of Bunker Hill

The Battle of Bunker Hill was a battle in the American War of Independence. It took place on June 17, 1775, mostly on and around Breed's Hill, during the Siege of Boston early in the American Revolutionary War. The battle is named after Bunker Hill, which is close and which was involved in the battle. Bunker Hill was the original objective of both colonial and British troops. Sometimes, the battle is called the "Battle of Breed's Hill."
On June 13, 1775, the Americans learned that the British generals were planning to send troops out from the city to occupy the unoccupied hills around the city. In response to this, 1,200 colonial troops under the command of William Prescott stealthily occupied Bunker Hill and Breed's Hill, constructed an earthen redoubt on Breed's Hill, and built lightly fortified lines across most of the Charlestown Peninsula.
When the British were alerted to the presence of the new position the next day, they mounted an attack against them. After two assaults on the colonial lines were repulsed with significant British casualties, the British finally captured the positions on the third assault, after the defenders in the redoubt ran out of ammunition. The colonial forces retreated to Cambridge over Bunker Hill, suffering their most significant losses on Bunker Hill.
Even though the British forces won the battle, they suffered heavy losses: over 800 people were wounded and 226 were killed, among them many officers. For this reason, the battle is seen as an example of a Pyrrhic victory: the immediate gain (the capture of Bunker Hill) was small and did not change the state of the siege very much, but the cost was high. Nearly a third of the deployed forces were either wounded or killed. Meanwhile, colonial forces were able to retreat and regroup in good order because they had suffered fewer casualties. Furthermore, the battle demonstrated that relatively inexperienced colonial forces were willing and able to stand up to regular army troops in a pitched battle.

They opened to the public on August 20, 1970 and were originally known as Vancouver Game Farm. The first animal to arrive there was a llama named "Dennis", who came from Mount Vernon, Washington. The facility was sold in 1991 and was renamed the "Greater Vancouver Zoological Centre" in 1995. After the sale, they built new animal enclosures, a miniature train ride, a picnic park, more landscaping, a remodeled entrance, more parking spaces, informational and educational programs and activities. Ownership changed in 1999 and the zoo was renamed "Greater Vancouver Zoo". The new owners focused on conservation and improving their educational programs.
On May 31, 2006, formal charges were laid against the zoo by the Crown Counsel of British Columbia, in accordance with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act because they failed to provide acceptable facilities for a baby hippo named "Hazina" that they acquired in October 2004. It was they first time that a major Canadian zoo was charged with cruelty to animals. The case was stayed in January 2007 when crown counsel believed that with the opening of a new habitat for hippos, that it was no longer in the public interest. The zoo lost its Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums accreditation for two years before regaining it back in 2012.

Solenodon

Solenodons (meaning "slotted-tooth") are venomous, nocturnal mammals in the family Solenodontidae. They are burrowing insectivores
There is only one genus, "Solenodon", They are interesting because they keep some primitive mammal characteristics. Their species resemble closely those which lived near the end of the age of the dinosaurs.
The two living solenodon species are the Cuban Solenodon ("Solenodon cubanus"), and the Haitian or Hispaniolan Solenodon ("Solenodon paradoxus"). The Hispaniolan solenodon lives in many habitats on the island of Hispaniola from lowland dry forest to highland pine forest. Two other described species went extinct during the Quaternary. Oligocene North American genera, such as "Apternodus", have been suggested as relatives of "Solenodon".

<doc id="451779" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=451779" title="Coracle">
Coracle

The coracle is a small, lightweight boat. They were used in Wales, parts of Western and South West England, Ireland, and Scotland The word is also to describe similar boats from India, Vietnam, Iraq and Tibet. The word "coracle" comes from the Welsh word "cwrwgl." This is related to the Irish and Scottish Gaelic word "currach." It is recorded in English as early as the 16th century. Other old English spellings include "corougle", "corracle", "curricle" and "coricle".
Corricles are oval in shape, and look like half a walnut shell. They are made with a framework of split willow branches, twisted together and tied with willow bark. Originally the outer layer was an animal skin from a horse or bullock. These skins were covered with a thin layer of tar to make them keep the water out. Today coracles are made with calico or canvas covered in tar, or simply fibreglass. The Asian coracle is made differently. It uses bamboo and the water is kept out with a layer of resin and coconut oil. The coracle does not have a keel. The flat bottom allows the weight of the boat and its load to be spread evenly. This means it does not need much water to float – as little as a few inches, making it ideal for use on rivers.
Coracles have different designs, as they are designed for the river conditions where they are built and used. The Teifi coracle is flat-bottomed, because it is designed for use in the shallow rapids which common on the river in the summer. The Carmarthen coracle is rounder and deeper, because it is used in tidal waters on the Tywi, where there are no rapids. Teifi coracles are made from local wood. They use willow for the body of the boat, called a lats. Hazel is used for the bit around the top, called Y bleth in Welsh. Tywi coracles have been made from sawn ash for a long time. These days working boats are made from fibreglass. Teifi coracles do not use nails. The twisting together of the lats makes them strong. The Carmarthen coracles use copper nails and are not twisted together.
Coracles are good for fishing because they do not disturb the water or the fish. They can be controlled easily with one arm, while the other arm manages the net; two coracles to a net. The coracle is moved with a broad-bladed paddle. These are also have different designs between different rivers. It is used in a sculling action. The blade makes a figure-of-eight pattern in the water. The paddle is used towards the front of the coracle, pulling the boat forward, with the paddler facing in the direction of travel.
A Welsh Coracle can be carried by a person on their back. 'Llwyth dyn ei gorwgl' — the load of a man is his coracle. (Welsh saying).
The coracle was designed to be used in the quickly flowing streams of Wales and parts of the rest of Britain and Ireland. Coracles are very old, Julius Caesar saw them in Britain in the 1st century BC. Archaeologists believe they have discovered the remains of a coracle in a Bronze Age grave at Barns Farm near Dalgety Bay. Others have been discovered at Corbridge and near Ferriby.
Coracles are so light that they can easily be carried on the fisherman's shoulders. Coracle fishing is performed by two coraclers. The net is stretched across the river between the two coracles. These are paddled with one handed and the net is dragged down the river in the other. When a fish is caught, each fisherman pulls up an end of the net until the two coracles are brought to touch, and the fish is grabbed and put into the boat.
Coracles are not used much these days. They can be seen in tourist areas of West Wales, and sometimes in Shropshire on the River Severn. There is a public house in Sundorne, Shrewsbury called "The Coracle". It has a sign showing a man using a coracle on a river. The Welsh Rivers Teifi and Tywi are the best places to find coracles in Wales. On the Teifi they are usually seen between Cenarth, Cilgerran and Llechryd.
In 1974 Bernard Thomas of Llechryd crossed the English Channel to France in 13½ hours in a coracle. The journey showed how the Bull Boats of the Mandan Indians of North Dakota could have been copied from coracles introduced by Prince Madog in the 12th century.
For many years until 1979, Shrewsbury coracle maker Fred Davies became famous among football fans. He would sit in his coracle during Shrewsbury Town FC home matches at Gay Meadow, and get the footballs that landed in the River Severn. Although Davies died in 1994, his legend is still linked to the club.
The Coracle Society is a UK-based organisation, started by its president, Sir Peter Badge in 1990. The society wanted:
There are many Society members across the country who show the coracle at events and/or run coracle building courses. Terry Kenny, the current chairman of the Society, runs several courses each year at the Green Wood Centre. Some of this year's events are listed on the official Coracle Society website.
The Society was present at the 2005 Shrewsbury River Festival, where they had various coracles on the River Severn. There is also an Annual Coracle Regatta held in Ironbridge on the August Bank Holiday Monday every year. It is organised by the Green Wood Centre. Anyone with a coracle can take part in the event. Each year new people come with coracles which they have made on the Bank Holiday weekend at the Green Wood Centre with local coracle maker Terry Kenny.
The third Coracle Challenge, which raises funds in support of Macmillan Cancer Support took place in Shrewsbury on 19 May 2009.
The coracle is an unstable craft. Because it sits "on" the water, rather than "in" it, the vessel can easily be carried by currents and the wind. The Coracle Society has written a guide for safely using coracles.
The oldest instructions for building a coracle are on a 4000-year-old cuneiform clay tablet. This was dictated by the Mesopotamian god Enki to Atra-Hasis on how to build a round "ark". The tablet is about 2,250 years older than than the flood myths, none of which contain such details. The earliest known written evidence of a coracle-type boat (quffa), still in use today, is in the Bible, Exodus 2:3.
The Irish curach (also "currach" or "curragh") is a similar, but larger, vessel still in use today. Curachs were also used in the west of Scotland:
The currachs in the River Spey were very similar to Welsh coracles. Other related craft include:

Polecat

Polecat is the common name for several medium-sized Mustelids. They do not form a single clade: the name is given to several similar species. 
The European polecat is typical, and is the only one native to the British Isles. Ferrets are the domesticated form of European polecats.
In the U.S., the term "polecat" is often applied to skunks, which are only distantly related to the European polecat. The reason is that polecats give off a scent which some people think is offensive. 
The simplest version puts them all in a subfamily of the Mustelidae:
Subfamily Mustelinae
There is a more recent version which splits them up even more.

Regular editors will remember we have problems with exceptionally long and technically complex articles. They are brought over from En wiki and left with minimal simplifications. Advice is more or less ignored, and the same editor brings over more and more articles... The sheer length is almost as much a problem as the complexity, IMO. Have a look at Suicide, for example. It's not so technical as the advanced chemistry articles we had a couple of years ago, but it is really formidable from the readers' point of view. 65 thousand KB! Well, I raise this because it reminds me of our previous experience. If we do not act promptly at the start, very soon we have a major problem on our hands. Medicine in general is beginning to look like one of our trouble areas. () 18:19, 12 April 2014 (UTC)
An IP editor has recently created a lot of new pages (mostly about things related to India and Pakistan), and I'm having trouble keeping up with them. Most need simplifying and new or different categories. I've deleted several because they weren't simplified enough from enwiki. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks. -- () 18:52, 12 April 2014 (UTC)
OK, I finished the other thing I had to do today, and took care of this. I did a mass delete and blocked the user for 72 hours.

A discussion about redlinks is underway at . () 15:20, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
I've noticed quite a few articles get created recently with links to pages (also called "dab pages"). We usually don't want links to dab pages. Many of these links have been to words that can mean either a nationality or a language (or sometimes even other things), for example English or French. If you're using a word like that, please check to be sure that it links to the specific page you want and not to a dab page.
Anyway, my reason for writing this is to ask everyone to keep this in mind when working on articles. It's easy to link a term whose meaning seems obvious when you read the article, but the link might not go to the page it should. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions about this. -- () 11:01, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

Our editors had reverted his vandalism 17 times over this period. So far, so good. However, when I looked at the talk page of the IP address I see a strange pattern of warnings. Some editors (as we advise) move up the ladder of warnings step by step, while others are routinely putting in a bottom-level warning. Others are giving no warning at all. If we have a system, then I think we should all use it. And, with a shared-user site, it is helpful to mention the vandalised page name in the warning. () 08:18, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

Can someone have a look at a recent wave of changes to articles about bands? IP has been adding the category Boy bands to any band made up of males. My understanding is that a boy band was a type of band based on the way it performed rather than just the sex of the members. Lots of singing and dancing, and very little playing of instruments. So One Direction would be a boy band but Guns N' Roses would not. Before I revert all the changes, could some one else give me a second opinion?-- () 23:22, 7 June 2014 (UTC)

Excuse me, I don't really agree with the idea BLP no source notices are used for people born in the last 115 years that are deceased. Examples include Patricia Highsmith, Cass Elliot, Linda Gary, Joanna Moore and Anna Lee. One user, however, appears to think otherwise (thinks that people born in last 115 years who don't have any sources on their articles need BLP no source notices). The truth is, regular no source notices apply because the person is no longer living. We must follow policy. Now sometimes, I put "no sources" due to some sources used on English Wikipedia not being recognized by the spam filters on Simple English Wikipedia.

I begun changing the format of the color comparison charts. with about 82 of them and 50 completed this will be a very slow process. It might take up to 2 week or 4 to complete the the change. In the meantime please do not revert it.
Advantages to the new format:
After a 3rd evening switching the color format from the bad table to a new user friendly color table, I realized the only ones left are the long ones. It would take an hour, 2, or 3 to complete 1 of the long ones. I only have Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday to do this from 4pm to 9pm, meaning that 6 of the long ones would be completed per week, with 32 of them, it would take 6 weeks (rounded up) to covert every single color page to the new format. I cant do all of this alone without spending 2 months (rounded up) myself. Anyone else come and help covert some of it, I did 50 of them. 9:17pm, 30 June 2014 (EDT) -- () 01:17, 1 July 2014 (UTC)

Hi all, 
the last two days I have been adding images to Wikipedia. So far images were added to 400 articles. I am using a little project that makes locating articles and images very easy. See the . 8 wikipedias (nl, da, de, pl, pt, fr, zh, simple) have added images to 4000 articles in the last month, and 10.000 images were added to wikidata. I have started with soccer players, but will eventually cover more topics as we progress. The first goal is to add images to pages that have no images. Later on we can add second images to articles with a single image. We can probably improve 5.000-10.000 articles on simple.wiki that have no image at the moment. All edits are done by hand. No existing images are changed in any way. All images are available on Commons under a free licence. This can go alot faster with your help. Come and join, and if you have any questions, let me know on my talkpage. One done, 5000 to go.
All the best, () 07:01, 2 July 2014 (UTC)
We have a lot of unused template sandbox pages. I don't think we need to keep them around when they aren't actively being used for testing. I wonder if we can come to a consensus that they can be deleted if they meet certain conditions. I'll throw these out to start with:

Some time in the last week or so, something changed so that the button on my watchlist page to mark all pages as visited doesn't display. Well, actually, it briefly displays when the page loads, but then it disappears. Has anyone else noticed this? Does anyone know if we've had a recent software update that could have done this? I don't think I changed any options. -- () 07:09, 6 July 2014 (UTC)

Hi everyone! I'm , and on English Wikipedia and other pedia's I changed my name back to my "original" Wikipedia name - Missvain. I screwed up (I think?) and I just logged into Simple under Missvain. How do we fix that? If possible? If not, that's OK, I can live with a low edit count and just move my userpage information over...but I'm not a sockpuppet...I just want to be Missvain, not my real name, anymore (even though it's history is OK, and ya'll can still call me Sarah :) )... so what's the best way to deal with this?

I recently changed my settings to include a few provisional ("beta") features. I think the way to implement such setting changes needs to be made more transparent. There is a button to revert to default but no button to implement changes. I just guessed and hit the enter key, which resulted in the changes being saved (according to a pop-up). How about a "save changes" button next to or under or over the revert button? (Myabe there already is one, but I sure couldn't find it.) () 03:50, 19 July 2014 (UTC)

A while back we had a discussion about the fact that some transport-related category names used the word "transport" and some used "transportation".

Please use this standard when creating new categories. Thanks. -- () 01:49, 20 July 2014 (UTC)

The Wikimedia Foundation recently created a new feature, "superprotect" status. The purpose is to prevent pages from being edited by elected administrators -- but permitting WMF staff to edit them. It has been put to use in only one case: to protect the deployment of the Media Viewer software on German Wikipedia, in defiance of a clear decision of that community to disable the feature by default, unless users decide to enable it.
If you oppose these actions, please add your name to this letter. If you know non-Wikimedians who support our vision for the free sharing of knowledge, and would like to add their names to the list, please ask them to sign an identical version of the letter on change.org.

I want to know what are the simple english vowels, are similar to the vowels of natural english or are similar to the 5 vowels of spanish?
I have searched in many places( Google, Wikipedia... ) but I didn't find the answer. 
When I go on "dif" I see rollback vandal and all the others twice (there are two rows). When I revert it doesn't go green and tell me it has been reverted it stays blue. Is everyone having this problem? --/ 04:54, 1 September 2014 (UTC)

Greetings! The is accepting proposals for funding new experiments from September 1st to 30th. Your idea could improve Wikimedia projects with a new tool or gadget, a better process to support community-building on your wiki, research on an important issue, or something else we haven't thought of yet. 
Whether you need $200 or $30,000 USD, Individual Engagement Grants can cover your own project development time in addition to hiring others to help you.
Adding a Wikilove button was discussed here and mentioned again here, apparently with no result. Some of us miss it when coming from the EN wikipedia and would like to use it here. I think I can accurately say that we miss the rapidity of using it, and want to use it for slightly off-the-wall purposes (mostly by choosing an image from commons and adding a message that refers in a humorous way to recent activities in the wiki). Not having it somewhat stifles interaction that could have been helpful to building the encyclopedia. I see that some people on EN objected to it, but were over-ruled, and as far as I can see their objections were handled in appropriate ways. A separate question would be whether the button would be enabled or disabled by default, so if many people objected here, it could be disabled by default, and turned on in each individual editor's preferences. Can we discuss this again? () 15:15, 16 August 2014 (UTC)

On the English Wikipedia, we started a project called TAFI. Each week we identify underdeveloped articles that require improvement. Our goal is to use widespread collaborative editing to improve articles to Good article, Featured article or Featured list quality over a short time frame.
This is all about improving important articles in a collaborative manner, and also inspiring readers of Wikipedia to also try editing. We think it is a very important and interesting idea that will make Wikipedia a better place to work. It has been very successful so far, and the concept has spread to the Hindi Wikipedia where it has been well received.
We wanted to know if your Wikipedia was interested in setting up its own version of TAFI. Please contact us on our talk page or here if you are interested.-- () 17:48, 2 September 2014 (UTC)
Just a reminder that is a good place to look for anyone wanting to find articles on Simple Wikipedia that may need flagging for deletion or merging. Not all of them of course, but it is a good indicator that an article may not pass Simple Wikipedia's notability criteria. It lists all Simple Wikipedia articles that have not yet been connected to a Wikidata item. Worth a check. Cheers. 16:55, 5 September 2014 (UTC)
I go through this list most days. The ones that are left are generally the ones that I have not been able to connect with other articles on Wikipedia via Wikidata. I simply can't find another Wikipedia that has covered the topic. I believe it is a very good indicator of whether the topic in question is notable. If no other Wikipedias are covering the topic, it's an indicator that it may not be notable, and so it should be checked. It may turn out that it is in fact a notable topic that just happens to not yet have a topic on any other Wikipedia, in which case, no need for deletion or merging (of course). I'm in no way saying that the articles in the list should be merged and deleted, or that presence on the list is a justification for deletion or merging. I'm just saying that those articles are the best ones to check as you're going to have a better hit rate. Cheers. 22:02, 6 September 2014 (UTC)
Some of you might not know that the admins can hide the content and/or edit summaries of edits in some circumstances. It's called , or "revdel". After using that function, most users can no longer see the parts that have been hidden. There are only certain things this can be used for. Some things it is "not" used for are personal insults and words that might make people uncomfortable but aren't actually considered offensive. (For example, a user once asked me to hide a change because a vandal had added the word "poo". I had to tell him that that word wasn't really offensive.) The link I gave has more detail.
When you undo vandalism that contains profanity or other truly offensive things, feel free to drop us a line to ask us to use revdel. -- () 21:18, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

Hello all,
there are quite a few userpages up for deletion, from users who have not edited here for some time. Before going through all these deletion requests, I propose the following solution:
I would prefer a discussion here (possibly resulting in a guideline), rather than having the same discussion several times on the RFD board. As always, comments are welcome. -- () 11:51, 8 July 2014 (UTC)
There hasn't been any more comment here for a while. Does anyone see any kind of consensus forming? -- () 20:51, 6 August 2014 (UTC)
This discussion seems to have stalled by nearly a month now, and we still have 12 user pages that are hanging around clogging up . I've read through the discussion above a few times now, and I think the 'outcome' of it could be summed up as follows:
In relating this to the existing RfDs around half would be eligible for deletion at first glance, although I haven't dug too far. Either way, they would all meet the above "criteria" if we went with the lowest suggested activity time, which is one year. They all show little prospect of becoming active or used in the current community and, therefore, should probably be deleted.<br>
However, that said, I am not sure whether there has been sufficient discussion here to create a new policy or guideline - the majority of the input has come from two users, with a further four commenting in total. Personally I have no opinion on the matter - they are not harming anything by existing, but I understand why others would want them removed.<br>
With this in mind I think that each of the twelve RfDs needs re-opening and "resetting" to run for one week and each is discussed by its own merit. Any further userspace pages can also be nominated for discussion per normal policy. More discussion needs undertaking both with regards to criteria for userspace discussion and WikiProjects (I'd support re-visiting the guidelines there) at this time. I have carried out the work with regards to the RfDs, although if anyone feels this wasn't appropriate please do revert me. I also abstain from providing a !vote on the RfDs as a result of this.<br>
Tl;dr: 12 RfDs have been re-opened and reset for discussion under standard RfD procedure. Further discussion is required on creating a variation to this policy for user pages, and with regards to WikiProject "policy". 00:13, 4 September 2014 (UTC)

<doc id="451826" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=451826" title="Albuterol">
Albuterol

Albuterol (also called salbutamol outside of the United States) is a type of medicine. It is a bronchodilator. This means it makes the bronchi - the tubes that bring oxygen to the lungs - get wider. This makes it easier for oxygen to get to the lungs. From the lungs, oxygen goes into the blood and travels to the rest of the body. In medicine, albuterol is called a "β2 adrenergic receptor agonist."
Albuterol is a generic medicine. In Canada and the United Kingdom, this generic drug is called salbutamol.
There are many different brand names for albuterol. The most common are Accuneb, ProAir, Proventil, and Ventolin.
Sometimes, diseases like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) make the bronchi get narrower. This makes it harder for oxygen to get to the lungs. This can cause trouble breathing or even respiratory failure, which means the body is not getting enough oxygen to survive.
Every part of the body needs oxygen to live. Without enough oxygen, parts of the body - like the brain - will start to die. Finally, a person's heart can stop if they do not get enough oxygen for a long enough time.
Albuterol can often keep these things from happening. Often, people with diseases like asthma or COPD are prescribed albuterol inhalers. As soon as they start having trouble breathing, they can use the inhaler to breathe albuterol right into their lungs. The albuterol will stop the bronchi from getting narrower, and will make them wider again. This makes it possible for normal amounts of oxygen to get to the lungs.
Albuterol has some common side effects. They include:
Albuterol can also cause tachycardia (fast heart rate) and palpitations (feeling like the heart is pounding or fluttering). Because of this, albuterol is used carefully in people who have heart problems.
Albuterol is also used by some for weight loss. Albuterol can cause rapid heartbeat or tachycardia. It causes blood pressure to rise and causes irregular heartbeats called cardiac arrhythmia. Bodybuilders sometimes use albuterol before contests to lose body fat and retain muscle. Abuterol is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for weight loss. Any abuse of Albuterol by taking too much can lead to a stroke or heart attack.

Movie release

A movie release (or premiere) is when a completed movie is released for the public to see. It may be in theaters or for home viewing. A movie's release date can affect how much money the movie makes. 
A movie's release date and how it is released is a part of the marketing of the movie. Often a movie will be tested on selected audiences to see how they like it. This is called a limited release. A movie might also be shown first at a film festival to see how it does. If an audience does not like something, the moviemakers can make changes before it is released to the public. 
Movie studios limit the number of major movies they release in a year. They also try not to release a major movie at the same time another studio does. The timing of when a movie is released can affect how much money it makes. When "A Little Princess" was released in 1995, the movie "Pocahontas" was released at the same time. Even worse (for revenues), both were aimed at the same target audience.
There were traditional times of the year for releases of certain types of movies. Summer was the traditional time to release blockbuster movies. These are large budget movies with a great deal of publicity. Spring was the usual time for art films. Another major time of the year to release major movies is Christmas. Lately, however, the movie calendar has become very crowded with more new releases. This means that blockbuster movies now come out all during the year.
A print is a copy of the physical film itself. Each movie theater needs a print for showing. This becomes expensive and along with advertising they are called 'P&A'. Advertising can include parties for the stars of the movie. It can also mean arranging interviews on talk shows and placing movie clips on video sharing websites like YouTube. This is to get people talking about the movie. The period of time for advertising a movie only a few weeks before it is released. After that time it is hoped will advertise the movie. 
The movie "Four Weddings and a Funeral" was released in the United States in 1994. The distributor, Polygram, had a limited P&A budget. They released the movie on a limited basis, in New York and Los Angeles. They spent heavily on advertising in these cities hoping the limited release would be a success. In this case it was and they used the profits to gradually release the movie all over the country. This is called a 'platform release'. It allows smaller movie studios to compete with the large P&A budgets of the big studios.

Wales Coast Path

The Wales Coast Path () is a long-distance footpath which follows the whole coastline of Wales. It opened on 5 May 2012. It is long, from Chepstow in the south to Queensferry in the north.
Wales is the first country in the world to build a footpath along its entire coastline. The Path runs through eleven National Nature Reserves and other nature reserves, including those managed by The Wildlife Trusts or Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). Lonely Planet rated the coast of Wales first in its Best in Travel: top 10 regions for 2012.
The Wales Coast Path was opened on 5 May 2012, as the world's first coastal path to cover an entire country. It follows the Welsh coastline from Chepstow in the south east to near Queensferry in the north. It joined together some existing paths, such as the North Wales Path, the Anglesey Coastal Path and the Llŷn Coastal Path. The Pembrokeshire Coast Path is a National Trail. and in 2011 was voted by National Geographic magazine as the second-best coastal destination in the world.
The long path goes through different coastal areas. These include the mouth of the River Dee, the seaside towns of north Wales, the Menai Strait, the Isle of Anglesey, the Llŷn Peninsula, Cardigan Bay, miles of sand in the National Park in Pembrokeshire, Gower, Cardiff Bay, Cardiff, and Chepstow.
The whole path can be used by walkers. Some sections can also be used by cyclists, families with pushchairs, people with restricted mobility, and horse riders.
The Countryside Council for Wales (now Natural Resources Wales) set up the path, and each of 15 local government areas it passes through look after their own section. There were already five coastal paths, in Pembrokeshire, Anglesey, Gwynedd, Ceredigion and the North Wales coast. These became five of the eight geographical areas that now make up the path. The other three areas are made up of single and combined counties and county boroughs with coastlines.
The Wales Coast Path was set up by the Welsh Government with the former Countryside Council for Wales, sixteen local authorities and two National Parks. Since 2007 the Welsh Government has spent £2 million per year to improve public access to the coast through its Coastal Access Improvement Programme. The European Regional Development Fund has also given £3.9 million over three years to support the project.
The idea for the path was based on the success of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path National Trail and the Isle of Anglesey Coastal Path. Plans for the path were shown by First Minister Rhodri Morgan in June 2006, at the opening of the 125-mile path around Anglesey. It was thought the project would take up to five years; it has been nearer six. Visitors to the Pembrokeshire and Anglesey coastal paths bring a lot of money into Wales. It was also seen as an important to encourage both locals and visitors to discover and enjoy Wales’ outdoor spaces, also gain health and welfare benefits from walking.
The Countryside Council for Wales said that improvements to the path would continue during 2012 and 2013. The path will follow the coastline as close as it is safe and practical. The completed path is expected to lead to making shorter circular paths, linking to inland towns and villages.
The official opening of the path took place in a number of places on 5 May 2012. These places showed the path’s beauty and ease of access for walkers of all ages, fitness and ability. To celebrate the opening, Ramblers Cymru, hosted the Big Welsh Coastal Walk, with over 5,500 people taking part. 
Northern Eye Books are writing the Official Guidebooks for five sections of the Wales Coast Path: North Wales Coast, Isle of Anglesey, Llyn Peninsula, Carmarthenshire and Gower, and the South Wales Coast. They already publish the Official Guide for Anglesey, "Walking the Isle of Anglesey Coastal Path" by Carl Rogers. There are also guidebooks to the Ceredigion Coast Path and the Pembrokeshire Coast Path by other publishers.
The first anniversary of the opening of the path was marked on radio and television. It is estimated that in that first year some 2.8 million people walked parts of the path, adding £16 million to the Welsh economy. It is estimated that more than 800,000 visitors to the path also stayed the night in one of the many guest-houses, B&B's and hotels along the route.
The of the Wales Coast Path joins the Offa's Dyke Path National Trail. This path follows the border with England, to make a walking path around almost the whole of Wales.
The Open Spaces Society is angry because some landowners will not allow the path to cross their land. This means more than 20% of the route will have to be on roads, sometimes out of sight of the sea. A Countryside Council for Wales spokeswoman said: “Just over 20% of the WCP is on road, slightly less than the average for national trails in Britain, which is in the region of 25%. This is mainly on quiet, country lanes.”
In 2014 there was a temporary road route north of Cardigan, connecting Gwbert with Mwnt. The Ceredigion Coast Path section in that area could not be used because of legal actions.
Walkers have a view overlooking a gypsy caravan site at Rover Way in Cardiff. People living here are worried about their privacy.

The United States in the 19th century

The United states was a country in the 19th century. During this time it grew from 17 states to 45 states. The year was from 1801 till 1900 in the Gregorian calendar. States like Utah, Illinois and Mississippi were added to the United States. There were 22 presidents. The Industrial Revolution was still going on. The first skyscraper was built and the White House became the home of the President of the United States. There was a war with Great Britain in 1812. In 1866 Alfred Nobel invented dynamite. The sport of Basketball was invented. In 1829, William Austin Burt patented a machine called the "Typographer" which many consider the first typewriter. The 19th century also saw the Great Chicago Fire. New York City was hit by the Great September Gale of 1815. 
The United States of America had 22 presidents in the 19th Century. Thomas Jefferson was the third President of the United States. He was the first elected president of the 19th century. The last one was William McKinley. McKinley started the presidency in 1897 and he left his presidency in 1901 which is just after the 19th century. All these presidents in the 19th century lived in the white house. 
Thomas Jefferson was born on the 13th of April in 1743. His parents were Jane Randolph Jefferson and Peter Jefferson. His brothers were Peter and Randolph. His sisters were Jane, Mary, Elizabeth, Marta, Lucy and Anna. He was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party. He was president from 1801 till 1809. He died on July 5, 1826 and was buried at Monticello.
Abraham Lincoln was born on 12 February 1809. This was while Thomas Jefferson was president. He was the second child of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Lincoln. He was born in the state of Kentucky. Lincoln married Mary Todd. His children were Robert, Edward, Willie and Tad. Lincoln belonged to the Whig Party and later the Republican Party. He was assassinated while still in office. 
Martin van Buren was born on December 5, 1782. He was born in Kinderhook, New York, US. His father was Abraham van Buren and his mother was Maria Hoes van Alen van Buren. His ancestor Cornelis van Buren had come to the United States in 1631 from the small city of Buren. Martin is the only president who has spoken English as a second language. His political party was called the Free Soil Party. Martin was president from 1837 till 1841. He died on July 24, 1862.
James Monroe was born on April 28,1758 in Virginia. His parents were Spence Monroe and Elizabeth. James Monroe married Elizabeth Kortright. Their children were Eliza, James and Maria. He died on July 4, 1831 in New York City. He was then 73 years old.
The transition from an agricultural to an industrial economy took more than a century in the United States, they lagged far behind their mother country, England. The Industrial Revolution started around 1750 in England, and fifty years later in the United States. This was because there was a lot of land to work on, but there was too less labour to do that. The industrial machines were expensive.
The start of the Industrial Revolution in America is caused by Samuel Slater, who built the first industrial mill in the United States around 1790. His cotton mill looked a lot like the British mill. But through this mill, the speed with which cotton thread could be spun into yarn was greatly increased.
Another cause of the rapidly changing economy were the new organizational strategies to increase the speed to make the products. This reformation was especially important for the shoe and boot industry. Were first the most products were made by hand.
But the most important change was the “Factory System” where products were produced on a large scale and then one specific product, but they needed people to operate the machines. A group of businessman called the Boston Associates recruited thousands farm girls from New England to operate the machines in the new factories.
One of the most known mill towns was Lowell, Massachusetts, which opened in 1823. The use of a female factory workers had advantages to both employer and employee. The Boston Associates preferred the young girls because they paid young girls less than men. These female factory workers were often called: Lowell Girls, named to the place Lowell.

<doc id="452014" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=452014" title="History of rail transport in the Netherlands">
History of rail transport in the Netherlands

History of rail transport in the Netherlands On the 20th of September 1839, the first train trip went through the Netherlands. It was a short trip from Amsterdam to Haarlem. The Train was called the Arend which was a type of steam locomotive. The history of the Dutch railways, the 6 era’s, was up to 1839. The planning for railways, 1840-1860 the early expansion of the railways. In the period 1860-1890 the government paid the making of the new railways. From 1890-1938 the railways strengthen into 2 large railways. 1938-1992 In this period the 'Nederlandse Spoorwegen' had in monopoly in the train industry. 1992-present The 'Nederlandse Spoorwegen' lost their monopoly. 
The first modern railway was built in England in 1830. It ran from Liverpool to Manchester. A Dutch artillery officer, William A. Bake, was there when it opened. When Bake came back to the Netherlands he made plans to connect Amsterdam to Amersfoort, and Amersfoort to Arnhem. King William supported Bake's plan. Unfortunately, his timing was bad. So was his plan to finance the railroad. Dutch businessmen did not want to invest their money at that time. They were worried about their investments in Spain. With no money, his plan did not work.
Luckily due the king, the railways got an upgrade, so they were more safe. The new railways could fit in the soil of the Netherlands. The railway track connected Liverpool to Manchester and you can already guess who made it. Since this railway track was the build the ideas of railroads spread across Europe. Belgium and Germany started to copy those railway tracks and King William I from the Netherlands could not stay behind.
He let engineers do research if the railroad system was possible in the Netherlands. But it was difficult to pay the railway tracks etc. The king made his decision on the 8th of August 1837. The Dutch government would pay the new way of transportation. After 2 years the first railway company was founded. It was called the: ‘Hollandse Ijzeren Spoorweg Maatschappij (HIJSM). They began with the construction of the railway track that connected Amsterdam and Haarlem. The first steam locomotive who drove on this track was a small locomotive called ‘de Arend’.
After the success of the first railway track that connected Amsterdam to Haarlem. The railroads started to expand and a new railway company was found. It was called the ‘Nederlandse Rhijnspoorweg Maatschappij’ (NSR). They both made the new railroad to Rotterdam The railway would cross everything. 
The NSR and the HIJSM bought every piece of land to proceed. But some landowners and farmers didn’t like the idea of a railway crossing their farm, because it could frighten the cows. There was even a big incident that happened while making a railway track that connected Amsterdam to Rotterdam. A land owner called Aernout Hendrik van Wickenvoort Crommelin only wanted to sell his piece of land if a train station was built favorable for him. The HIJSM and NSR didn’t like that so they tried to make the railway track go around his piece of land. Unfortunately it failed. Still Aernout had given them some land to continue. The NSR and HIJSM lost a lot of money on this incident and it was later called: ‘Het laantje van van der Gaag'. The railroad was finished in 1847.
The NSR also wanted to built a railway by their self. This railway would go from Amsterdam to Utrecht to Arnhem and then on to Germany. The making of it didn’t went really well because they could not find enough investors. But luckily was our King William I again the savior of the railroads. But there was a problem with the constructing of the railway because the Dutch railways were built on Dutch broad gauge and the connection in Germany was made on standard gauge. The railroad to Utrecht was finished on December 18, 1843, The next stretch to Arnhem on May, 16 1845. The final stretch to Germany took 11 years because the other part of the railroad had to be made in Standard gauge.
In 1860 the ‘Spoorwegnet’ was found. It’s a system that connects all the cities with railways built by the government. The citizens of the cities founded that their city must be connected to the Spoorwegnet because otherwise their city would lose popularity.
In 1863 a new railway company was found to full the wishes of the citizens. It was called the ‘Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen or SS for short. This company wasn’t found by the government but by a private group of investors who received a license for the railways built by the State. 
The other companies just continued with building railroad tracks. There even more Railway companies found. The Noord-Brabants-duitse Spoorweg-Maatschappij or NBDS
S for short. It was found to finish the railway track that connected Saint Petersburg, Berlin and London.
In 1890 all the railway companies were fused together and split into 2 companies. The HSM and the SS. The railways were reclassified and based on the English models. This was necessary because for people of the Netherlands, travelling by train wasn’t very handy due to all those companies who had their own rules and trains.
In 1903 the labor of the railway companies weren’t happy with their work because, the condition in which they had to work was very bad. They had a low wage for the hard work they had to do. In 1903 were the workers very angry so they went on strike. And it worked because the bosses of the companies could not do without them so the conditions were improved etc. When the first world war began in 1914 the Netherlands stayed neutral. The train transportation was now partly used for militaries. The railways were a part of the war because it was easy to transport. Due this war the HSM and the SS had to work together and even after the war they became closer. This has led to a fusion in 1937 The ‘Nederlandse Spoorwegen’ or NS was found.
In total there are 404 railway stations in the Netherlands. 381 stations are managed by the NS. Some of them are really old looking and some of them are more by the time. There are also really ugly stations like Eindhoven CS. Today the day the stations have become much more evolved.
In the past you only had those yellow boards where you could look for the trains. You could not for example look on the internet. There were no for example escalators, which now can’t be thought of gone. An really old station for example is Zandvoort. A rather new one is Utrecht CS. By Zandvoort you can really see the old architecture.
There have been a lot of different trains. It evolved from steam trains into diesel trains and into electric trains. 
The first train was called the Arend and it drove from Amsterdam to haarlem. Then a lot of different steam trains came who were all called series + a number, so like series 600. 
After a lot of development a new kind of train was invented who went on diesel. It was much cheaper and easier to use. Currently the only diesel trains that are still been used are called: The buffel. The lines they are still used on are: Zwolle – Enschede, Zwolle – Kampen, and Apeldoorn – Zutphen. 
Today the day we mainly see electric trains driving. They are noticeable by the big electricity masts above them which give them power. Trains are usually divided into two classes: the first and the second. 
In the past there also was a third class but they thought that was not useable. Almost all the trains have now a day's free Wi-Fi wireless connection so you can go on the internet.In the past you had to buy a ticket to take the train, nowadays you can use your OV chipkaart. 
• Sprinter, are fast trains who don’t have many stops.
• The Thalys is a new super-fast train which can have speeds from up to 300km/h.
• Intercity, is also a fast train who goes from a city to another city without stops.

"Youth of the Nation" is the second single off American Christian nu metal band P.O.D.'s fourth studio album "Satellite". The song was released on December 25, 2001.
The song was inspired partially by the Santana High School and Columbine High School shootings. In a 2008 interview, guitarist Marcos Curiel described it:
"We were rehearsing and writing Satellite a couple of blocks away from the school. One day on the way to the studio, there were all these helicopters and cars speeding by. We really didn’t know what was going on. When we got to the studio, this guy had the news on, and he was like, ‘This kid just went and started blasting fools.’ So we started jamming, and that rhythm just naturally came out then Wuv [Bernardo, drummer] put that drumbeat on it, and the song was born."

The Pentre Ifan dolmen is the largest and best preserved neolithic dolmen in Wales. It is on the ancient manor of Pentre Ifan in the civil parish of Nevern, Pembrokeshire, Wales. The manor was the home of the Bowen family going back to the 11th century.
The dolmen dates from about 3,500 B.C. It may have been used for group burials. The existing stones form the door, called a portal and main chamber of the tomb. These would have been covered with a large stone mound about 36.6 m long and 17 m wide. Some of the stones have been scattered, but at least seven are in their original position. The capstone is 5.1 m in length, and is thought to to weigh 16 tonnes, and rises 2.4 m above the ground. It is held up by the narrow tips of three uprights. These stones make a chamber that is 3 m long, 2 m wide and 3 m high. A large stone has been used to block the entrance.
The facade around the portal is a carefully built dry stone wall.
William Francis Grimes carried out archaeological diggings at the site in 1936/1937 and 1958/1959. Small pieces of flint and pottery were discovered during these digs. This are also signs that there may have been holes dug for some sort of ritual purpose long before the dolmen was set up.
The dolmen is owned and looked after by Cadw, the Welsh Historic Monuments Agency. The site is well-kept and entrance is free. It is about 17 km from Cardigan. It has views down the Nevern Valley to the sea.

Pembrokeshire Coast Path

Pembrokeshire Coast Path () (also called the Pembrokeshire Coastal Path) is a National Trail in Pembrokeshire in the Wales, in the United Kingdom. It is a footpath that anyone can walk anytime for free. It was made a footpath in 1970. It is long. The highest place on the path is Pen yr afr. It is high. It's lowest place is Sandy Haven crossing. It is low at the water. The path goes along coast and people walking on the path will see the water most of the time. 
The path starts at Amroth and goes north to Poppit Sands. A plaque is located at Poppit Sands. The path used to stop, or start, at Poppit Sands. Now it goes to St. Dogmaels. At St. Dogmaels the path connects to another path called the Ceredigion Coast Path. The Pembrokeshire Coast Path is a part of the Wales Coast Path.
The Pembrokeshire Coast National Park was founded in 1952. After it was founded, Ronald Lockley did a survey for a path on the coastline. The region was very rural. There were villages on the coastline but communication between other villages was very hard. People often used boats to visit each other. Lockey reported on this in 1953. He suggested that a footpath be created to help. Most of the places the path would go through were public space, so anyone could walk on them without any problems. Other parts were owned by people, so you could not walk on the path without asking. They asked the owners if it was okay to use their land for the paths and most people said it as ok. There are still some areas of the path that go in strange directions because path users cannot walk on the private land. It took 17 years to build the path. 100 footbridges and 479 stiles were built. Thousands of stairs were built into the ground.
The path was opened on May 16, 1970 by Wynford Vaughan-Thomas. It was long. Now it is .
Most of the path is located in Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. The path goes along the Irish Sea. There are many different types of geological and environmental areas. There are headlands, cliffs, coves, glacial valleys, and more. The path goes by 58 beaches and 14 harbors.
Most of the path is easy to walk. There is one part that goes high. There are two areas near the water that it passes which sometimes get flooded. These parts are at Dale and Sandy Haven. The path goes through some towns and villages. These include Tenby, St Davids, Solva and Newport. 
There are some trails that connect to the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. They are:
The rocks under the path are over 300 million years old. The look of the land that the path goes along is the effect of the Ice Age. There are a variety of different types of rocks one can see on the path: igneous, pre-Cambrian, and more.
Walkers on the path can see wild flowers during the seasons of Spring and Summer. There are a lot of birds. Many of the birds are seabirds. There are also porpoises, dolphins, and seals in the water off the path.
There are historical sites on the path that date back to Neolithic times. There are places where there used to be hut circles. There are former places that people lived in during the Bronze Age and Iron Age. Most of the land near the path is farmed and people also fish off the path like they did in ancient times, but with modern tools.
The path was named the second best "National Geographic's" place to visit on a coast in 2011. The beaches along the path are famous also and have won over 300 awards for their quality, environmentalism and beauty.

Hysteresis

Hysteresis is a concept in physical science.
In hysteresis the output of a system depends not only on its input, but also on its history of past inputs. This is because the history affects the value of an internal state. To predict the future outputs of a system, either its internal state or its history must be known. 
The effect may happen because of a lag between input and output. This effect disappears as the input changes more slowly. This effect meets the description of hysteresis given above, but is often referred to as "rate-dependent hysteresis" to distinguish it from hysteresis with a more durable memory effect.
Hysteresis occurs in ferromagnetic materials and ferroelectric materials. It also occurs in the deformation of some materials (such as rubber bands and shape-memory alloys). Many artificial systems are designed to have hysteresis: for example, in thermostats and computers.

The Anglesey Coastal Path is a is a footpath on the island of Anglesey, Wales in the United Kingdom. The footpath is a part of the Wales Coast Path. 
The footpath follows the coast of the island of Anglesey. It goes around the entire island except in two places. Those two places are Plas Newydd and Afon Alaw between Llanfachraeth and Llanynghenedl. The path starts at Holyhead. It travels through an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

Kármán line

The Kármán line is the altitude where space begins. It is about 62 miles (100 km) high. It commonly represents the border between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. This definition is accepted by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI). The FAI is an international standard setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics. The line is named after Theodore von Kármán (1881–1963), a Hungarian-American engineer and physicist. He was active in aeronautics and astronautics. He was the first to calculate that around this altitude, the atmosphere becomes too thin to support aeronautical flight. An aircraft at this altitude would have to travel faster than orbital velocity to obtain enough lift to support itself. There is a sudden increase in temperature of the atmosphere and solar radiation just below the line. This places the line within the greater thermosphere.

Battle of Hampton Roads

The Battle of Hampton Roads was a naval battle of the American Civil War. It was fought on March 8 and 9, 1862 near Hampton Roads, Virginia. It was an important battle because it was the first combat between ironclad warships.
The Confederate ironclad "CSS Virginia" tried to break the Union navy blockade of Hampton Roads. The blockade prevented all commerce with Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia. On March 8, the "Virginia" sank and damaged several union battleships. On March 8, the Union ironclad USS "Monitor" arrived and fought the "Virginia". The battle lasted for several hours. But neither ship could defeat the other. Both ships left the fight thinking they had won. But the Confederates failed to break the blockade. 
Both ironclads were lost soon after the battle. When Norfolk fell in May 1862, the CSS "Virginia" was destroyed by its crew so it wouldn't be captured. The USS "Monitor" was lost in a storm near Cape Hatteras on December 31, 1862. Her wreck was found in 1974.
The Battle of Hampton Roads did not make a big difference in the outcome of the Civil War. But it changed the way people fought wars with ships. The battle proved that ironclad warships were much stronger than wooden ships. After this battle, the U.S. and other countries stopped building wooden ships. They started building iron warships instead.

Dumb Starbucks was a coffee shop opened by comedian Nathan Fielder. It was closed just after three days for not having a proper health license. Because the shop was a parody making fun of the real Starbucks company, Fielder was able to use their logo.
In a normal Starbucks store, you will usually see a board with the beverages that you can purchase. But in Dumb Starbucks, it had the word "Dumb" in front of the name of the beverage you would see at Starbucks. For example, if you saw the Vanilla Latte at Starbucks, in Dumb Starbucks, it would be called "Dumb Vanilla Latte". Usually Starbucks has some other items, such as music CDs, but Dumb Starbucks also took the same music CD's and wrote the word "Dumb" in front of them.
Nathan Fielder had planned to open another Dumb Starbucks in Brooklyn, New York, but he didn't try to open one, even with health documents. Many people have did not like Fielder and his new parody. Some people felt he was making fun of them being Starbucks customers, others said his coffee was just terrible.

George Eliot (spy)

George Eliot was an English spy during the rule of Queen Elizabeth I.
George Eliot is reported to have been a very bad person. He earned his living as a con artist (someone who gains the trust of another and then tricks them out of their money). He was well known as a rapist and suspected of being a murderer. Eliot became a spy for Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester. This was to avoid a charge from the last crime he committed. Eliot agreed to seek out Catholics who did not attend Mass or conform to the rules of the state. He would then hand them over to the authorities for punishment.
At Lyford Grange in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), he tracked down the Jesuit priest, Edmund Campion. Eliot called for a magistrate from Abingdon. He arrested Campion and had him sent to London for trial and execution.

Thermostat

A thermostat is a sensor which keeps a heating system near to a desired temperature or setpoint. It is a control system.
The thermostat works by switching heating or cooling devices on or off. This is what happens in a central heating system or an air conditioner. In some systems it works by switching a 'heat transfer fluid' off or on as needed to keep the set temperature. The name is derived from the Greek words "thermos" "hot" and "statos" "a standing".
The simplest kind of thermostat is a bimetal strip which bends as the temperature rises, and at a set point breaks the circuit of an electrical current. Kitchen toasters use this kind of thermostat.
Because they control a system, thermostats are examples of feedback devices which maintain a steady local environment against temperature changes outside the outside world. In cybernetics, the thermostat is an example of a machine which uses feedback to maintain the stability of a heating system.

Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn

Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn (c. 1362 – 30 September 1440), was a powerful Welsh marcher lord. He became Baron after his father's death in July 1388. His main military actions were against the Welsh, during the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr. 
Reginald de Grey was responsible for giving out royal demands in the Northern March. This included calling the local nobility and gentry and their men to Royal and military service. He was had been in a long-running legal argument with Glyndŵr, claiming part of Glyndwr's land as his own. Under King Richard II the case had been found in favour of Glyndŵr. When Henry IV became king, Grey took over the land. 
Glyndŵr tried to take legal action in 1400, but the court told him to give the land to Grey. Grey also did not tell Glyndŵr that his men were needed service in Scotland until the last moment. This made it impossible for Glyndŵr to send the men or even send an explanation for not sending them. Refusing or failing to follow an order of the King was treason. Glyndŵr's lands were would be taken until he could prove he was loyal to the king or receive punishment. On 16 September Glyndŵr and his brothers burned Grey's property. For three days his Welsh forces attacked the countryside of Flintshire and Denbighshire. On 24 September, Glyndwr's forces were defeated at Welshpool.
De Grey asked Glyndŵr to a meeting, but arrived with a large force, and attempted to capture Glyndŵr. Glyndŵr escaped and went into hiding, becoming a traitor in English eyes. King Henry took the land of Glyndŵr's friends, and gave them to John Beaufort, his half-brother. The rebellion spread across Wales by 1402. Lord Grey was taken prisoner by Glyndŵr's forces in an ambush near Ruthin in January. 
A ransom of 10,000 marks was asked for him. Lord Grey was made to promise not to fight against Glyndŵr again. King Henry IV sent 11 knights to meet with Glyndŵr. They paid the money to release Grey. Lord Grey and his family would have been expected to repay the money. 
The Grey family sold the Ruthin Lordship to King Henry VII in 1508 when the family needed money. 
Grey was a member of the Council which governed England during the absence of Henry V in France in 1415. He later fought against the French in the Hundred Years' War in 1420 and 1421. He also served as Governor of Ireland.

An ORCID is a code to identify someone who writes academic articles. ORCID stands for Open Researcher and Contributor ID. Each person can have their own ORCID. ORCIDs make it easy to know which articles someone has written, even if they change their name. They also helps tell who has written which articles, if there is more than one writer with the same name. ORCID was started on 16 October 2012.
ORCIDs usually have four groups of four numbers. An example of a person with an ORCID is John Wilbanks. His ORCID is http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4510-0385.

The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 hit the city of Galveston, Texas on September 8, 1900. This hurricane was very large, and it is the deadliest hurricane in the history of the United States. It killed between 8,000 and 12,000 people. It was a "Category 4 hurricane" on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.
The U.S. National Weather Service was very simple in 1900. They did not have good information on what the storm was doing. As a result, they could not give people advance warnings. Galveston was located on a sandbar island off the coast of Texas. It was only about nine feet above sea level. The population was about 38,000. On the morning of 8 September 1900, nobody knew that 8,000 of that number would be gone by the next day.
The Galveston hurricane began developing about August 30, 1900 in the middle Atlantic Ocean. It was still a tropical storm when it moved to Cuba on September 4. It hit Key West on September 6. At that point it became a full hurricane. It was a Category 4 hurricane when it got near the Texas coast. In the early afternoon of September 8 it hit with little warning. By the next morning it was gone and so was much of Galveston. After that, it moved back east as a tropical storm over the U.S. The damage was over $30,000,000. Galveston began rebuilding almost right away. A new seawall was built and many buildings were raised several feet. But it could not recover completely. The storm convinced most in the shipping industry to move to Houston with its safer harbor. Galveston would never again be the busiest shipping port in Texas.

Independence (statistics)

Probability theory talks about events which occur with a given (possibly unknown) probability. Usually, when it talks about several events occurring, it assumes that if one event occurs, this does not change the probablility of the other events occurring.

Viverravidae is a monophyletic family. In viverravids, the number of molars is reduced to two and the skull is long. 
They are probably not related to any living carnivorans. The viverravids were previously thought to be the earliest carnivorans. A recent study of their skull morphology puts them outside the order Carnivora.

<doc id="452391" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=452391" title="Bardsey Island">
Bardsey Island

Bardsey Island (), is a small island off the coast of Wales. Bardsey is wide, long and in area. The north east rises steeply from the sea to a height of at "Mynydd Enlli." The western end is low and flat farmland. On the south, the island narrows to a peninsula with a lighthouse. It is the fourth largest island in Wales.
Bardsey has several names, including the "Island of 20,000 saints". In Welsh the name means "The Island in the Currents". In English name means the "Island of the Bards", or possibly the "Island of Barda", a Viking chieftain
The island has been an important religious site. In 516 Saint Cadfan built a monastery on Bardsey. In medieval times many pilgrims visited the island, and by 1212 the monastery was part of the Augustinian Canons Regular. In 1537 Henry VIII closed the monastery and had the buildings pulled down, but pilgrims still visit the island.
Bardsey Island is famous for its wildlife and rugged scenery. A bird observatory was set up in 1953 as the island is on important migration routes. It is a nesting place for Manx shearwaters and choughs. It also has rare plants, and habitats undisturbed by modern farming practices. It is a good place to see grey seals, dolphins and porpoises.
The spirituality and sacredness of the island, its relative remoteness, and its legendary claim to be the burial site of King Arthur, have given it a special place in the cultural life of Wales. It has attracted artists, writers and musicians to its shores. It has inspired award winning literature.
The island is formed from rocks of the late Precambrian Gwna Group, part of the Monian Supergroup. The rocks are a mélange, often called Gwna Mélange, which have an unusual mix of clasts of all sizes up to 100m across. These are also very varied types, including both sedimentary and igneous rocks. Blocks of sheared granite in the melange can be seen in the northwestern coastal cliffs of the island. In other places there are clasts of quartzite, limestone, sandstone, mudstone, jasper and basalt. The deposit is an olistostrome, a very large underwater landslide possibly caused by an earthquake some time after 614 million years ago.
A dolerite dyke of Ordovician age can be seen in the melange at Trwyn y Gorlech in the north. There is an olivine dolerite dyke of Tertiary age at Cafn Enlli in the southeast. Further dykes can be seen in the cliffs at Ogof y Gaseg and at Ogof Hir.
A thin spread of glacial till stretches across the centre of the island. This was left behind by the Devensian Irish Sea Icesheet. There is a small patch of blown sand at Porth Solfach on the west coast and a landslip at Briw Cerrig at the foot of the cliffs on the east coast.
People lived on the island in Neolithic times, and traces of their hut circles remain. During the 5th century the island became a place of refuge for Christians and a small Celtic monastery existed. In 516 Saint Cadfan arrived from Brittany and directed the building of St Mary's Abbey. In medieval times three pilgrimages to Bardsey Island were said to be equal to one visit to Rome. In 1188 the abbey was still a Celtic institution, but by 1212 it belonged to the Augustinians. Many people still walk to Aberdaron and Uwchmynydd each year in the footsteps of the saints. Only ruins of the old abbey's 13th-century bell tower remain. A Celtic cross in the ruins commemorates the 20,000 saints claimed to be buried on the island.
Saint Deiniol, the bishop of Bangor, was buried on the island in 584. Saint Dyfrig was also buried on Bardsey Island, although in 1120 his remains were moved to Llandaff.
The "Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act" of 1536, on the orders of Henry VIII, resulted in "St Mary's Abbey" being closed and its buildings pulled down in 1537. The choir stalls, two screens and the bells were moved to Llanengan, where the parish church was then being built.
For many years Bardsey Island formed part of the Newborough Estate. Between 1870 and 1875 the island's farms were rebuilt. A small limestone quarry was opened, and a lime kiln set up. "Carreg" and "Plas Bach" are separate buildings, but the remaining eight were built as semi-detached houses, each pair with outbuildings set around a shared yard. The buildings are Grade II listed. In 2008, Cadw gave £15,000 to help with some repairs. Only one of the original "croglofft" cottages, "Carreg Bach", is still standing. Given the choice of a harbour or a new church, in 1875 the islanders asked for a place of worship; a Methodist chapel was built.
The island had a population of 132 in 1881; by 1961 it had fallen to 17. The island's small school, opened in a former chapel in 1919, closed in 1953. By 2003 the population was down to 4.
"Bardsey Island Trust ()" bought the island in 1979. It was given money by the Church in Wales and many Welsh academics and public figures. The trust gets its money from membership subscriptions, grants and donations. It wants to protect the wildlife, buildings and archaeological sites of the island. It also promotes its artistic and cultural life, and wants people to visit as a place of natural beauty and pilgrimage. In 2000, the trust advertised for someone to run the sheep farm on the island. They had 1,100 applications. The farm is now run by the "Royal Society for the Protection of Birds"; and the land is managed to keep the natural habitat. Oats, turnips and swedes are grown; goats, ducks, geese and chickens kept; and there is a mixed flock of sheep and Welsh black cattle.
An old and twisted apple tree was found growing by the side of "Plas Bach." It is believed to be all that is left of an orchard planted by the monks who lived there a thousand years ago. In 1998, experts on British apples said this tree was the only example of the "Bardsey Apple ()". The tree has been propagated by grafting and is available commercially.
Bardsey Lighthouse stands on the south end of the island and guides vessels passing through St George's Channel and the Irish Sea. It is the only square lighthouse looked after by Trinity House.
Lt. Thomas Evans R.N., asked for a light on the island in 1816. In 1821 Trinity House built the lighthouse at a cost of £5,470 12s 6d with another £2,950 16s 7d for the lantern.
Joseph Nelson was the engineer and builder. He had served under Daniel Alexander, a Trinity House architect, whose influence can be seen on parts of the design including the heavy weathered string-course near the base and the blocked and hooded directional-light window. Joseph Nelson is linked to the design of at least 15 lighthouses, mostly in the Bristol Channel.
The Lighthouse is built of ashlar limestone and is not plastered. It is painted in red and white bands on the outside. The Lighthouse tower is 30 m (98 ft) high and is unusual because it is square, not round. Unlike many other lighthouses, it has kept its original gallery railings, which are of iron and bellied (i.e. curved out in width at their crowns) towards the top. The present lantern, fitted in 1856, did not need the original railings to be taken down.
The walls are 1.2 m (4 ft) thick at the base and 0.9 m (3 ft) at the top.
At first, the light had reflectors but changed to a dioptric (refracting) mechanism in 1838. The present lantern of 1856 is a 4.27 m (14 ft) wide chamfered octagon and the light is fixed, instead of revolving. The present revolving apparatus was put in place in 1873. It gives a group of five flashes, at first with an oil-lamp, but changed to electric in 1973.
The Lighthouse is unusual in lacking any sort of harbour. As it is on an established migratory route, the tower has many bird casualties. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and Trinity House have tried to help the problem by providing perches on the lantern top and flood-lighting the tower, but this does not seem to have helped.
In 1987 the Lighthouse was changed to automatic operation, and is now checked by the Trinity House Depot at Harwich. A local person does regular maintenance.
"Y Storws", also known as "The Boathouse", was built a few years before the lighthouse, near the landing place at "Y Cafn".
The island was made a "National Nature Reserve" in 1986, and is part of "Glannau Aberdaron ac Ynys Enlli Special Protection Area ()". It is now a favourite bird-watching location, on the migration routes of thousands of birds. "Bardsey Bird and Field Observatory" (), founded in 1953, nets and rings 8,000 birds each year to study their migration patterns.
The island was made a Site of Special Scientific Interest because of its maritime life. This includes internationally rare lichens; bryophyte, plants, bird species; and intertidal communities. Nationally important flowering plants include sharp rush, rock sea lavender, small adder's tongue, western clover, and the rare purple loosestrife. Two nationally rare heathland lichens are found on the slopes of "Mynydd Enlli": the ciliate strap lichen and golden hair lichen; and there are over 350 lichen species in total. The leafcutter bee, which cuts neat, rounded circles in rose leaves, used to seal the entrance to its nest, is native.
Thousands of birds pass through each year on their way to their breeding or wintering grounds. Chiffchaffs, goldcrests and wheatears are usually the first to pass through, followed by sedge warblers and willow warblers, whitethroats and spotted flycatchers.
About 30 species of bird regularly nest on the island, including ravens, little owls, oystercatchers and the rare chough. Hundreds of sea birds, including razorbills, guillemots, fulmars and kittiwakes, spend the summer nesting on the island's eastern cliffs. There are no land predators such as rats or foxes on the island. On a dark moonless night an eerie cackling can be heard across the island as 7,000 pairs of Manx shearwaters, 3.5 per cent of the British population, come ashore to lay and incubate their eggs in abandoned rabbit warrens or newly dug burrows.
The island is one of the best places in Gwynedd to see grey seals. In mid summer over 200 can be seen, lying in the sun on the rocks or swimming in the sea. About 15 pups are born each autumn. Their sharp teeth and strong jaws are perfect for breaking the shells of lobsters and crabs which live in the waters. It is also possible to see bottlenose and Risso's dolphins, and porpoises. The currents around the island carry food-rich water. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has been carrying out surveys since 1999 to find out which areas are important for feeding and nursing calves.
The seas around the island are rich in marine life. There are forests of strap seaweed; in the rock pools are sea anemones, crabs and small fish; and in deeper waters, the rocks are covered by sponges and sea squirts. The yellow star anemone, found offshore, is more common to the Mediterranean.
It was tradition for the island to elect the "King of Bardsey"" (Welsh:Brenin Enlli"). From 1826 he was crowned by Baron Newborough or his representative. The crown is now kept at Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool, although calls have been made for it to return to Gwynedd. The first known King was John Williams. His son, John Williams II, the third of the recorded kings, was deposed in 1900, and asked to leave the island as he had become an alcoholic. At the start of World War I, the last king, Love Pritchard, offered himself and the men of Bardsey Island for military service. He was refused as he was considered too old at the age of 71. Pritchard was angry and declared the island a neutral power. In 1925 Pritchard left the island for the mainland, to seek an easier way of life, but died the following year.
Yorkshire born poet Christine Evans lives half the year on Bardsey Island, spending the winters at Uwchmynydd. She moved to Pwllheli as a teacher, and married into a Bardsey Island farming family. While on maternity leave in 1976, she started writing poems, and her first book was published seven years later. "Cometary Phrases" was "Welsh Book of the Year 1989" and she was the winner of the first "Roland Mathias Prize" in 2005.
Edgar Ewart Pritchard, an amateur movie-maker from Brownhills, produced "The Island in the Current", a colour movie of life on Bardsey Island, in 1953. A copy is held by the "National Screen and Sound Archive of Wales".
Opera singer Bryn Terfel, a patron of the Bardsey Island Trust, has performed in the island's chapel. Llio Rhydderch recorded "Enlli "in 2002, an album inspired by the spiritual feelings from a pilgrimage.
Dilys Cadwaladr, the former school teacher on the island, in 1953 became the first woman to win the "Crown" at the National Eisteddfod, for her long poem "Y Llen". Artist Brenda Chamberlain won the "Gold Medal for Art" at the Eisteddfod on two occasions: in 1951 for "Girl with Siamese Cat", and in 1953 with "The Christin Children". Some of the murals she painted can still be seen on the walls of "Carreg", where she lived from 1947 to 1962. Wildlife artist Kim Atkinson, whose work has been widely shown in Wales and England, lived on the island as a child, and came back to live there in the 1980s.
Since 1999," "Bardsey Island Trust has had an Artist in Residence who spends several weeks on the island producing work which is later shown on the mainland. A Welsh literary residence was created in 2002; singer-songwriter Fflur Dafydd spent six weeks working on a collection of poetry and prose. Her play "Hugo" was inspired by her stay, and she has produced two novels, "Atyniad ()", which won the prose medal at the 2006 Eisteddfod; and "Twenty Thousand Saints", winner of the "Oxfam Hay Prize", which tells how the women of the island, starved of men, turn to each other.
In 2009 Cowbois Rhos Botwnnog became the first electric rock group to play on the island, as part of S4C's "Bandit" series.
There is a ferry services to Bardsey Island from "Porth Meudwy" and Pwllheli.
At times, the wind and the fierce sea currents make sailing between the island and the mainland impossible. Sometimes boats are unable to reach or leave Bardsey Island for weeks. In 2000, 17 visitors had to stay for two weeks when strong winds prevented a boats from reaching the island.

Bryn Celli Ddu

Bryn Celli Ddu is a prehistoric site on the Welsh island of Anglesey near Llanddaniel Fab. Its name means 'the mound in the dark grove'. It was robbed in 1699 and archaeologically dug between 1928 and 1929.
During the Neolithic period a stone circle and henge stood at the site. There were 14 stones in the circle, and the henge was about 30 m in diameter, with a ditch about 5 m across. The ditch was about 2 m deep. There was probably a path or causeway across the ditch to the henge. A small human bone from the ear, covered with a flat stone, was found in an area of burnt material in the centre. The amount of silt in the ditch showed that it had been used for a long time.
The stone circle was pulled down in the early Bronze Age. Five of the stones were removed, two were pushed over, and six were smashed, and one was buried.
A passage grave was built in the centre of the henge. The passage is about 8.5m long and 1 m wide. The burial chamber is about 2 m wide, made from six large upright stones, covered with two capstones. A stone, carved with a twisting, serpent like design was in the burial chamber. It has been moved to the National Museum of Wales and replaced with a copy standing outside. The earth barrow covering the grave was made in after the 1928 dig; the original was probably much bigger.
In 1906 Norman Lockyer said that Bryn Celli Ddu marked the summer solstice. This was made fun of at the time, but research by Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas in 1997- 98 showed it was true. They also say the site can be used as an agricultural calendar. Steve Burrow, curator of Neolithic archaeology at Amgueddfa Cymru (National Museum of Wales), has more recently supported the case for summer solstice alignment. This alignment links Bryn Celli Ddu to other sites, including Maes Howe and Newgrange, both of which point to the Winter solstice. It has also been suggested that a feature similar to the 'lightbox' at Newgrange may be matched at Bryn Celli Ddu (Pitts, 2006).
A row of five postholes which were thought to have been dug at the same time as the tomb, about 3000 BC, are now known to be much earlier. Early results from radiocarbon tests show that pine charcoal from two of the pits goes back to the Mesolithic (Pitts, 2006).
Two researchers, Rupert Soskin and Michael Bott recently suggested that the pillar standing within the chamber is in fact the petrified remains of a tree trunk. Study of the pillar shows that it looks like the bark of a tree, however what is unknown at the moment, is whether the pillar is indeed petrified wood or natural rock chosen by the tomb builders because of its unusual appearance.

IOS 8

iOS 8 is the eighth major version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS. It was announced at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 2, 2014. It contains several new features, such as an app named Health, and a framework called HealthKit. 
Siri is able to be activated hands-free when it is plugged into power and can also tell users what song is playing using Shazam integration.
The Golden Master of iOS 8 was released to developers on September 9, 2014, and the final release of iOS 8 was released to the public on September 17, 2014.
The Photos app now has more options to edit the user's pictures. The cropping feature now allows the user to turn the image clockwise and counter-clockwise. The user can also set the brightness and colors you want for the user's pictures. The Camera app now has a shot timer that can be set for 3 or 10 seconds.
Users can send audio and video messages by holding down the record button.
The design of iOS 8 is the same as iOS 7 or iOS 7.1. There are some small changes such as added transparency and faster animation effects. The multitasking screen now shows a list of contacts that the user has talked with recently, as well as the user's favorite contacts.
iOS 8 also includes a new predictive typing feature called QuickType. It displays word selections above the keyboard as the user types. The feature can be turned off in Settings, or hidden using a swipe gesture. In addition, iOS 8 will allow users to install third-party keyboards. 
In iOS 8, a user can add six other people as family members. Family members can share purchased apps, music, and books using the same credit card. iOS 8 can also set up photo streams for every family member. The calendar can also sync between all family members. 
iCloud Drive allows users to save photos, videos, documents, music, and other data on iCloud. A user can start their work on one device and continue their work on another device. Users will get 5 GB of storage for free, but they can buy more storage.
HealthKit is a service that allows developers to make software that will be included in the new Health app. This app tracks user's steps, oxygen, sleep and other data. Users can also make an emergency card to help them in case of an emergency. HealthKit is only on iOS 8.4 or later/Higher.
Continuity allows users to share e-mails and websites over Wi-Fi. It also allows users to answer phone calls and respond to text messages on their Mac or iPad. This feature works on devices that have OS X Yosemite or iOS 8.
Spotlight now gives the user suggestions from Wikipedia entries, places nearby, trending news, and more. It’s even smart enough to recognize context and location to offer users the most relevant information.
In iOS 8, Apple integrated Wi-Fi calling. This service allows mobile phone calls over Wi-Fi. It is planned to be available for customers of T-Mobile in the US.Apple developers have removed many errors in IOS 8 Beta 5 like Wi-Fi sync but many other problems are still there
A study by Crittercism found that the rate at which applications crashed in their tests was 3.56% on iOS 8, higher than the 2% found on iOS 7.1.
Although the update is officially available for the iPhone 4S, it is recommended that users of the iPhone 4S do not upgrade, due to problems such as the battery draining quickly and the phone hanging up whenever a user makes a call.
On September 24, 2014, the iOS 8.0.1 release caused problems for iPhone 6 devices by turning off Touch ID and not allowing the phone to make calls. The update was released at 12:00 PM EST, and at around 2:00 PM EST, Apple removed the update due to these problems, as well as other small problems. A day later, Apple released iOS 8.0.2 which has all the fixes included with iOS 8.0.1 and also fixes the problems that iOS 8.0.1 brought.

There they were formed into the 9th Regiment, Illinois volunteer infantry. There were rumors that the Confederates intended to invade at Cairo, Illinois. In response, orders were issued for the 9th Infantry to occupy Cairo. They arrived and set up camp on 1 May 1861.
The first few months were spent on the Mississippi river guarding Cairo. Their three-month enlistments were up in July. Most of the men reenlisted for three years. In September the regiment moved to Paducah, Kentucky. There they did little more than drill practice. On 15 February 1862 they joined the fighting at the Battle of Fort Donelson. Their losses included 36 killed and 165 wounded, out of a total strength of 600. After the Confederates surrendered, they were transported by riverboats up the Tennessee River. They left the boats at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee and camped nearby. On 6 April 1862 they woke up to the sound of cannons. While they were waiting to join the battle, new orders were given. They were ordered to exchange their gray coats for Union blue. This way they would not be mistaken for Confederate troops. They then joined the battle of Shiloh. They fought most of the day. At Shiloh the 9th Illinois had the highest casualties of any Illinois unit. They lost 366 of their comrades They also fought at the Second Battle of Corinth. The regiment was changed to the 9th Illinois Volunteer Mounted Infantry Regiment on March 15, 1863. On 9 July 1865 the 9th Illinois Infantry was mustered out (released from military service) at Louisville, Kentucky.
The regiment suffered 5 officers and 211 recruited men killed in action or mortally wounded. 1 officer and 200 enlisted men died of disease. In total there were 417 casualties (persons killed or wounded).
The 9th Illinois volunteers, along with the 8th, 11th, and 12th, all wore gray coats trimmed in blue. They also wore Zouave caps. In 1862, they were fitted with the standard Union blue uniforms. Most of the Illinois infantry regiments were issued the Springfield Model 1861 muskets.

It was the longest ship ever built and had the greatest deadweight tonnage that has ever been recorded. When it was heavily loaded, the ship had a displacement of 657,019 tonnes (646,642 long tons; 724,239 short tons) and had a draft of 24.6 m (81 ft). Due to it's size and lack of maneuverability, it was not able to move through the English Channel, Suez Canal or the Panama Canal.
The ship was built in 1979 by Sumitomo Heavy Industries at the Oppama shipyard in Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan. The ship was sunk during the Iran–Iraq War but was salvaged, restored and put back into service. The ship sailed its final journey in December 2009 after being sold to Indian ship breakers. It was then intentionally beached in Alang, Gujarat, India and was demolished.

Presbyornis

Presbyornis is an extinct genus of water bird. It was a wading bird, often walking in shallow water on its long legs.
"Presbyornis" was one of the first anseriforms. Because of its long legs and neck, it was initially mistaken for a flamingo. Later it was reclassified as an anseriform when the duck-like anatomy of its skull and bill was found. It is from an extinct group closely related to ducks and geese. Judging from numerous fossil findings, "Presbyornis" probably lived in colonies around shallow lakes. Its broad, flat bill was used to filter food (small plants and animals) from the water, in the manner of today's dabbling ducks.
The fossil record includes many complete skeletons from Green River Formation sites (early Eocene). This suggests that the birds nested in colonies, similar to many colony-nesting waterfowl or shorebirds today. Species of this bird have also been found in Maryland, Utah, England, and Mongolia.
Fossils are held in the Smithsonian Institution, the Natural History Museum, London, and the KUVP.

Anglo-Saxon England

Anglo-Saxon England is the history of England from the 5th to 11th centuries.
The Anglo-Saxons were people from Germanic tribes. They first came as migrants to southern Britain from central Europe. Anglo-Saxon history begins after the end of Roman control.
In the 5th and 6th centuries there were seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms: Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia, Essex, Kent, Sussex, and Wessex.
Anglo-Saxon Christianity arrived in the 7th century. Viking invasions and Danish settlers started in the 8th century. The gradual unification of England under Wessex hegemony occurred during the 9th and 10th centuries.
Anglo-Saxon England ended with the Norman conquest of England by William the Conqueror in 1066. 
Anglo-Saxon identity survived beyond the Norman Conquest, and slowly developed into the modern English people.

Michael Smith (chemist)

Michael Smith CC, OBC, FRS (April 26, 1932 – October 4, 2000) was a British-born Canadian biochemist. He was the winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (shared with Kary Mullis) for his work in developing site-directed mutagenesis. 
After graduation with a PhD in 1956 from the University of Manchester, he studied with Dr. Har Gobind Khorana (himself a Nobel Prize winner) at the British Columbia Research Council in Vancouver, Canada. 
Smith received many awards in addition to the Nobel Prize, and was known for his generosity. He gave half of the Nobel Prize money to researchers working on the genetics of schizophrenia. The other half he gave to BC Science World in Vancouver and to the Society for Canadian Women in Science and Technology. He received the Royal Bank Award in 1999, and donated the grant to the BC Cancer Foundation.
In 1978, Smith, with former Fred Sanger colleague Clyde A. Hutchison III, introduced a new technique into molecular biology. This technique, called "oligonucleotide-directed site-directed mutagenesis", showed how to find the effect of a single mutant gene. They developed a synthetic DNA. With this they compared different protein molecules to show what the mutation did.
The new technology allowed deliberate alteration of genes to change the characteristics of an organism. It helps new diagnostic strategies and new treatments for genetic diseases. It may even allow the creation of artificial forms of life.
The team's paper describing site-directed mutagenesis was published as "Mutagenesis at a specific position in a DNA sequence" in the "Journal of Biological Chemistry" in September 1978. For the team's work, Smith shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Kary Mullis, the inventor of the polymerase chain reaction.

There are 2 arrondissements in the Tarn-et-Garonne department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into "arrondissements", which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture.
If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture.
The arrondissements are further divided into cantons and communes.

The style of Orange Caramel is Candy Culture which means to be cute, lively and fancy, but pure and sensitive. Their target is Asian market, so they got also Chinese name which is DeungJaChoDang(橙子焦糖).
They made two trends in Korean pop music. One is a unit group trend. After Orange Caramel was made, many unit groups were made, for example, Girls' Generation-TTS from Girls' Generation, Rainbow Pixie from Rainbow, Sistar19 from Sistar. Also the other is '선병맛 후중독' trend which means when you sees their show, it is hard to understand, but gradually and unconsciously you are addicted to it.
Orange Caramel have released totally 11 albums. However, they mainly have done music activities with 6 songs (Magic Girl, A~ing♡, Bangkok City, Shanghai Romance, Lipstick, Catallena). Orange Caramel released its first album "Magic Girl" on June 21, 2010. Althought the concept of their original group, Afterschool, is sexy and strong, that of Orange Caramel were different. Their stage is very shocking to K-pop. At the same year, they released the second miuni album "A~ying♡". The song also had big effect on K-pop and its lyrics were controversial because the lyrics is so strange that it is hard to listen it. 
In 2011, they released the first single album "Bangkok City" for the global "One Asia project", and another album "Sanghai Romace" for the "Sanghai Project". These songs also succeeded in Korea music market.

Chungyang Red Pepper

Chungyang Red Pepper is one of the hottest chili pepper species ("Capsicum annum"). It is grown in Korea. It is a genetically improved strain of Thai and Jeju-do chili peppers. It was developed by Dr.Il-ung Yoo in 1983. Chungyang Red Peppers have 10,000~23,000 Scoville heat units in average.
The name Chungyang comes from the name of the county, Cheongsong and Yeongyang.
Red pepper grows well in high temperature. Proper temperature to grow is 25~28 °C during the day and 18~22 °C during the night. It's better not to drop the temperature under 13 °C. When temperature stabilizes in 20~25 °C it is the best time for plants to bear fruits. If the temperature drops under 15 °C or rise over 30 °C, fertility of the plant is seriously damaged resulting in windfall and malformed fruit.
Even though red pepper requires high temperature, it does not require that much of a sunlight. However, the deficit of sunlight in long-term can result in poor quality and number of the produce, so it is better to give adequate amount of sunlight. Light saturation point is 30,000 lx, which is lower than other typical vegetables.
Most Chungyang Red Peppers are cultivated outdoors and some of them are cultivated indoors.
Normally, farmers harvest peppers that are cultivated outdoors in late July. It ripens from the bottom and peppers placed closer to a root are more likely to ripen well and have more vivid red color. It can be harvested until we have the first frost and till then, we can harvest five times from one root in average. The quality of produce is affected by how many times have peppers being harvested. For example, if the root can bear fruits five times, then the first produce will have more thicker fruit skin and also the taste of it is better because the first one has strong sweet flavor and hot flavor at the same time in harmony. However, the color is little bit darker and less in red than the second or third one, so it is easy to be mistaken as worse produce than later produce.
Technically through indoor cultivation, farmers can harvest through out the year. There is no quality difference between the first produce and the last one like the case mentioned in outdoor cultivation. The one raised in this environment has taller stem body and bears more fruits than the one raised outdoors. Especially, because it stays always indoors, it doesn't get wet, so can block all kinds of diseases caused by excessive humidity. Because of these advantages, more and more farmers cultivate Chungyang Red Pepper indoors.

The event consist of five sports: Baseball, basketball, soccer, rugby, and ice hockey. The event started in 1956, with all 5 sports included. The origin of Korea-Yonsei Match (Yonsei-Korea Match) is a tennis competition round between players of Bosung college which is former Korea University and Yonhui college which is former Yonsei University which was held in May 30, 1925. After the match, the two schools got into another competition in 1927. This time the two school collided in a soccer match. Korea University and Yonsei University had other matches after the match and it was almost annually held. It was not officially annual then. Since the period was the period of Japanese colonial era in Korea, the competition of two schools grew as a national event of Korea.

Korea-Yonsei Match also plays a role of the biggest festival of both Korea and Yonsei university. The two university shows another college rivalry like Harvard verses Yale University, Stanford University verses UC Berkeley, and in Korea, KAIST verses POSTECH, since they are the top two most famous private universities. During the Korea-Yonsei match, stores of each hometown, Anam and Sinchon, put many placards humiliating the rival in the streets. Huge festival in thrown in each town biannually. Festival takes place in Anam in even number years and in Sinchon in odd number years.
One of the customs takes place during the festival is 'human train march'. People from each department make a long line and put their hands on the shoulder of front person making a long train-like rows. The human trains marches and wanders through streets. They ask for side-dishes and bottles of alcohol to the owners of the stores, restaurants and bars. The alumni and university student council pre-pay for the side-dishes and bottles of alcohol to the owners. The human trains make themselves full and drunk enough then move to bars they have made reservation.
Cheering for each team is a huge joy for the students of both university. Students dance to the cheering anthems and sing along with them. The most popular and famous cheering anthems are Minjokui Aria(Aria of People), Batnorae(Sailing song) in Korea University and Yonseireul Saranghanda(I love Yonsei), Wonsirim(Virgin Forest) in Yonsei University. Each university sings Batnorae and Wonsirim when the team scores in each sports events. There is a joint cheering event between two university twice a year. Students practice their cheering in the two joint events and also cheering learning time in their orientation camp.

Software release life cycle

A software release life cycle is the different stages of making a computer program, giving it out to other people, and making sure the computer program works right after it is released.
Pre-alpha is the first stage of making a computer program. People making the computer program think up what the computer program should have in it, and start to actually create the computer program itself.
Alpha software is a computer program that can do most of what the programmers (people who make the software) want it to do, but it has lots of problems. Only the things that the programmers "really "want the software to do has been made without many problems.
A computer program goes into beta when programmers have made the software do everything it needs to do, but there may still be problems. The people who make the software then give it out to other people, so they can test whether the software works. Often, they find problems that they did not find in alpha.

Conwy Castle

Conwy Castle () is a castle that was built in the Middle Ages. It is in Conwy, in the country of Wales. It was built by Edward I of England. He built it after he went to Wales and took over control of it, conquering it. He built it between the years of 1283 and 1289. It is part of the city walls. It cost £15,000 to build. The castle has survived wars like Madog ap Llywelyn. Richard II of England hid there in 1399. Owain Glyndŵr took it over in 1401, too.
After the English Civil War started in 1642, people who supported Charles I of England took over the castle. They stayed there until 1646, which was when the Roundheads took it from them. When that war ended, the government partially destroyed the castle, so no one would use it. By 1665 it was completely destroyed because people had taken all of the iron and lead from the castle and sold it. Artists started making paintings of the castle in the 18th and 19th centuries. People started visiting it on vacation and it is now ran by Cadw.
Conwy Castle was called one of the best Middle Ages military places in Europe by UNESCO. It is a World Heritage Site. The castle is rectangular. It is made from local stone and stone brought from other places. There are two parts of the castle: "Inner Ward" and "Outer Ward". It has eight towers and two barbicans. There is a gate which has a path that goes down to River Conwy. This path let the castle get supplies from boats and fishing. It has one of the oldest machicolation's in the country. It also has a bedroom which was used by kings and queens. The castle was based on the buildings made by James of Saint George.
Conwy was a Cistercian monastery before it was a town. It was often visited by the Welsh princes. It is also a place where a person can cross the River Conwy going from the ocean area to the inland. The area has been owned by kings who have been from England and Wales since 1070.
In 1282 Edward I of England attacked the castle. He had a big army. They came to the castle from the north. They came from Carmarthen. They also came from the West. The army came from Montgomery and Chester. The town of Aberconwy was captured by Edward in March 1283. He decided to use the castle as the center point for a county. There used to be an abbey where the castle was. Edward had the abbey relocated. He wanted to own the castle so that other people thought he was very powerful.
After Edward decided to build the castle people started building it quickly. Sir John Bonvillars was the foreman for the building of the castle. A mason named James of St. George also worked on the project. They started building it in 1283. From 1283 until 1284 they built the walls and towers. Next, they built the buildings inside the castle walls. They also built walls for a town nearby. That took place between 1284 and 1286. They finished building the castle in 1287. People came from all over England to help build the castle. People would meet in Chester and walk to Wales to work at the castle. In total the project cost £15,000. That was a lot of money back then.
The castle had a person who was both constable and the mayor of Conwy. That person also managed 30 soldiers. A carpenter, chaplain, blacksmith, engineer, and stonemason worked at the castle. In 1294 Madog ap Llywelyn started to fight against the people who ruled England. King Edward moved to Conwy to escape Madog ap Llywelyn. He lived at the castle from December 1294 until January 1295. He was only able to get supplies and food from the sea. Eventually, soldiers came and helped him in February. After that time, various people lived at the castle. This included Edward's son, who would become Edward II of England. He lived there in 1301.
The castle fell apart during the 14th century because people did not take care of it. By the year 1321 the roof was leaking and the wood was rotting. In 1343, Edward, the Black Prince took over the castle. He fixed it with the help of Sir John Weston. Weston worked for Edward. They added a lot of things, including arches to the great hall. When Edward died, the castle fell apart again.
Richard II of England started living in the castle towards the end of the century. He stayed there to escape Henry IV. When Richard got back from Ireland on August 12, 1399, and went to the castle, he met Henry Percy. Percy worked for Henry IV. The two talked to help stop the fighting. Percy promised to not hurt Richard. Richard surrendered on August 19 to Henry Percy at Flint Castle. He said he would stop being King if he was allowed to live, not die. Richard was taken to London. He died at Pontefract Castle.
A rebellion started in 1400, during the rule of Henry IV. It was started by Owain Glyndŵr. This was just after Richard was told he was no longer king. Two cousins of Owain Glyndŵr, Rhys ap Tudur and his brother Gwilym, attacked the castle as a surprise. They dressed up like carpenters and acted like they were going to fix the castle. The got inside, killed two watchmen, and took over the castle. Their troops took over the town. The brothers lived there for about 3 months. They gave up after Henry IV promised to forgive them and they would not go to trial.
The castle was almost used during the War of the Roses but by the time the war ended it did not see any activity. The castle went through repairs in the 1520s and 1530s by Henry VIII. The castle was used as a prison and sometimes people who visited Conwy stayed at the castle.
The castle had fallen apart again by the 1600s. It was sold to Edward Conway by Charles I in 1627. Edward bought it for £100. Edward's son, also named Edward, took over the castle in 1631. It was a ruin. In 1642, the English Civil War started. John Williams, Archbishop of York, took charge of the castle for the king. He used his own money to fix the broken parts of the castle. In 1645, Sir John Owen became governor of the castle. The two men argued about this, since Williams was supposed to be running it, not Owen. Eventually Williams gave up and moved back to London. The castle was taken over by Thomas Mytton between a siege in August and November of 1646.
After the siege, Colonel John Carter became governor of the castle. He made more repairs to fix it. In 1655, the English Council of State was told, by the Parliament of England, to pull down the castle so people could not use it anymore. The Bakehouse Tower was partially torn apart during that time. The castle was given back to Edward Conway by Charles II as part of the Restoration. But, five years later Conway took all of the iron and lead that was on the castle and sell it to make money. A man named William Milward was in charge of taking the iron and lead off the castle. The people who lived in the town of Conwy protested the removal. Conway and Millward did not care and the castle became a complete ruin.
By the end of the 18th century the castle ruins were called "picturesque" and beautiful. People and artists would visit the castle from around the country. Artists would paint pictures of it, including the artists Thomas Girtin, Moses Griffith, Julius Caesar Ibbetson, Paul Sandby and J. M. W. Turner. Bridges were built over the River Conwy to the town from the Llandudno in the 1800s. The new bridges brought more tourists to the area. The two bridges included the Conwy Suspension Bridge, built in 1826, and the Conwy Railway Bridge, built in 1848. This allowed people with boats, cars, and riding in trains to visit the castle. The Holland family was running the castle, and in 1865 they gave it to the local government to run. The town helped to restore the ruins and they fixed the Bakehouse Tower. The castle was leased in 1953 to the Ministry of Works. They had Arnold Taylor start to fix the castle. He also researched the castle's history. A new road was built to the castle in 1958. It was going to be made into a monument by the country. In 1986 it was called a World Heritage Site.
Today it is ran by Cadw and tourists visit it. As of 2010, 186,897 people had visited the castle. They opened a new visitor center in 2012. The castle always has to be repaired. Between the years 2002 and 2003, it cost £30,000 to maintain and repair the castle.
The castle is considered one of the best "examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe," by UNESCO. It sits on the coast. The coast is made up of a lot of rocks, including grey sandstone and limestone. Most of the stone that the castle was built out of is from this stone. The sandstone used to make carvings was brought from the Creuddyn peninsula, Chester, and the Wirral. That sandstone had more colors than the grey sandstone that was local. It might have been chosen not only because it was easy to carve, but also because it was pretty.
The castle is rectangular. It has two different sections, the Inner Ward and the Outer Ward. It has four towers. They are and there is one on each side of the castle. The castle would have been painted white with lime render during its early days. The towers have holes in them, called "putlog holes". These holes were used to help the builders build the towers, by putting wood timber pieces through the holes so they could climb up the towers. There are also square holes that are found in the castle walls. No one knows what they were used for. Maybe they were used to get rid of water when it rained, used for hoardings, or for displaying decorations.
The main entrance to the castle is through the western barbican. That barbican used to go over a drawbridge and a ramp from the town. Today, the path goes along the east side of the walls. The barbican has some of the oldest machicolation stones in Britain. In the early days, the gate to the castle was probably protected by a portcullis.
Through the gate is the Outer Ward. When it was first built, this is where administrative duties were. People were handling business and management of the castle. This is where the northwest tower is located. People could live inside of it, and also store things. There is also the southwest tower, which was used by the constable. There was also a bakery inside of it. On the southside of the Outer Ward, there is a great hall and a chapel. There are also cellars. There is an old great arch from the 1340s. A jail was in a tower behind the great hall. There was a dungeon inside of it. The north side of the Outer Ward has a kitchen, brewery, bakery, and inside the tower people could live and store things.
There used to be a wall that separated the Inner Ward from the Outer Ward. The wall, which was inside the castle, had a drawbridge and a gate. There was also a ditch which made it hard to cross if the gate was closed. In the 16th century, the ditch was filled up so people could walk over it and the drawbridge was removed. This is where the spring that the castle gets it water from is located. The well is deep. The Inner Ward is where the royal guests and residents lived. It is also where their staff and servants lived. The royal bedrooms, also called "chambers", are considered the finest preserved in England and Wales. The Inner Ward was supposed to look like a very small version of a royal palace. The reason the wall, gate, and ditch were built was so that if there was an emergency or an attack, the Inner Ward could be sealed off from the Outer Ward, which would fight against invasions.
The rooms where the royals lived were on the first floor in a series of small buildings. There were four protective towers for the Inner Ward. One of the towers was a chapel where the royals would have religious services. All of the towers had turrets for security. They also each displayed the royal flag. It is believed that this part of Conwy Castle was designed similar to that at Corfe Castle. The king could have his own private time while having a lot of security to keep him and all inside safe. There used to be two apartments inside, but eventually they were made into one apartment with three rooms.
The east side of the Inner Ward has another barbican. This is where the castle garden is. The royal apartments could see the garden from their windows. There used to be grass there, and then vines, crab-apple trees, and flowers. There was a small gate that led to a small dock on the river. This allowed visitors to visit and leave the castle with very few people seeing them. It also allowed people to get supplies for the Inner Ward from boats.
The architecture is similar to that found in the kingdom of Savoy during the 13th century. This includes the way the windows were designed, the positioning of the "putlog" holes. Historians think that Conwy Castle was influenced by the work of architect Master James, from Savoy. The similarities to Savoy architecture might also be because many of the men who worked on building Conwy Castle were from Savoy.

Gender selection

Gender selection (or sex selection) is the attempt to control the gender of human offspring. It can be done either before or after the fertilisation of the egg. It has been promoted by the term family balancing. In certain countries, particularly China, Nepal and India, sons are often preferred to daughters. In the United States, slightly more Americans preferred boys to girls. 
The methods used for gender selection are of two main types. One occurs before fertilisation by making sure there are more sperms with a Y chromosome (which produce a male). The other acts after fertilisation by selecting only male embryos to develop.
The Ericsson method uses the extra weight of sperms carrying the X chromosome. They swim slower than the lighter sperms with the Y chromosome. This test tube method increases the chance of having a boy from just over 50% to just over 70%. The method is called 'sperm sorting'.
The "in-vitro" fertilisation uses ovarian stimulation to cause the mother to produce a number of eggs. The eggs are fertilised in the laboratory by the father's sperm. Then the sex of embryos is discovered by taking a single cell from the ball of cells which has divided after fertilisation. One or more male embryos are then implanted in the mother's womb so they will develop.
Probably the most common method uses selective abortion. The sex of an embryo can be found by amniocentesis: cells are taken from the fluid surrounding the embryo. This is regularly done to identify genetic defects in the embryo. The procedure gives the information about sex early enough for abortion to be a safe practice.
Sex selection has only recently become available. Sex selections are legal in most of the world. It is practiced mostly in Western countries, though more limited for Eastern countries, such as China and India. There is fertility tourism from the United Kingdom or Canada. That’s because preimplantation genetic diagnosis (a potential expansion of in-vitro fertilization that can be used for gender selection) is not allowed in Canada or the United Kingdom.

Embryo transfer

Embryo transfer is a medical procedure. It is a step in the process of assisted reproduction (also called fertility treatment), which uses science and medical treatments to help women who have difficulty getting pregnant. 
In embryo transfer, embryos are placed in a woman's uterus. The goal is to create a pregnancy. The embryos can be either fresh or frozen. If they are frozen, they are thawed right before they are transferred. Embryo transfer is the last step in a type of fertility treatment called in vitro fertilization.
Embryo transfer can be used for humans or animals.

Aglet

An aglet, or aiglet, is the small tip on the end of a shoelace or rope. It can be plastic or metal. It keeps the fibres from fraying or unwinding. This makes it easier to hold, and easier to feed through a hole, such as a grommmet, eyelet, or lacing guides.
The word "aglet" (or "aiglet") comes from the Old French word, "aguillette" (or "aiguillette"), which means "needle". This in turn comes from "acus", Latin for "needle". An aglet is like a small needle at the end of a cord.
There are two main types of aglets. Some are purely functional, that is to simply stop fraying, while others can also be decorative. Decorative aglets are on the end of decorative cords, such as bolo ties, or on the aiguillettes of military dress uniforms.
Aglets today are most often made of plastic; they also have been made of metal, glass, and stone. Many were highly ornamental and made of metals such as silver. Before the invention of buttons, they were used on the ends of ribbons to hold clothing together. Sometimes they were formed into small figures. Shakespeare called these an "aglet baby" in "The Taming of the Shrew".
Homemade aglets can be made out of adhesive tape, wax, resin, glue, thread, heat shrink or metal tubing, and by simply knotting or melting the end of a lace or cord. During the Great Depression, aglets were made out of paper and glue.

2014 Moncton shootings

The 2014 Moncton shootings were shootings that took place on June 4, 2014 in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada. Three members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were shot and killed in Moncton. Two other RCMP officers were also injured in the attack. 24-year-old Justin Bourque is suspected of committing the shooting. He was caught after he was found in a yard on Mecca Drive and was taken into custody on June 6, 2014. After he was caught, he told police, "I'm done." The shooting lasted from June 4, 2014 to June 6, 2014. It was the first homicide in Moncton since 2010 and was the deadliest attack on RCMP members since the Mayerthorpe tragedy in 2005.
George LeBlanc, Mayor of Moncton said in a statement on Twitter that the shooting was "Terrible sad news for Moncton. Stay indoors and allow police to do their job. Prayers for the families." Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper said in a statement "On behalf of all Canadians, Laureen and I offer our deepest condolences to the families, colleagues and friends of those affected by this tragedy. We also offer our prayers for the speedy recovery of those injured." He also said that the incident reminds us that "men and women in law enforcement put their lives on the line in Canada every day to protect our citizens and communities".

Turner syndrome

Turner syndrome, also known as 45 X, is a genetic disorder of human females. It is usually caused by the loss of one of the X chromosomes.
Turner's syndrome occurs in 1 out of 2000, to 1 out of 5000 female births. The condition is much more common "in utero" (that is, before birth). About 1–2% of all conceptions are affected, of which only 1% survive to birth.
Girls with Turner syndrome often have webbed necks, short stature, broad chests and low hairlines. Heart disease, hypothyroidism (reduced hormone secretion by the thyroid), and diabetes are other problems that may be present. Autoimmune diseases and infertility may also occur. These girls usually have normal intelligence but may have some trouble with vision and hearing.
Girls with Turner Syndrome sometimes receive Human Growth Hormone (hGH). Human Growth Hormone regulates growth in the human body. Human Growth Hormone helps girls with Turner Syndrome grow normally.
Many girls affected by Turner’s syndrome also may experience learning disabilities. These are usually related to subjects that are not related to verbal subjects. A girl’s visual or motor coordination may be impaired, and she may have trouble with her spatial perception as well.

Royal Mail 4 State Customer Code (commoly abbreviated to RM4SCC) is a two-dimensional barcode that was develooped by Royal Mail in England. It is used for marking the postcodes of letters and parcels in the UK. The system, or one of its variants is also used in other countries. The printed code is optimized for being read at a high speed.
The barcode consists of a number of vertical bars. Each bar has one of four possible states. Four bars are necessary to code one of 36 possible characters. Two of the four bars point upwards, the other two point downwards. RM4SCC uses start and stop symbols. The RM4SCC barcode includes a checksum, which is also encoded as a character. 
There are other barcode systems, which are similar. TNT Post uses a system called KIX which stands for Klant index (Customer index). This system does not use the start and stop characters, and does not include a checksum.
Universal Postal Union has defined a standard how the system should be used.
Note that the code is read and printed at high speed, at which it is usually not possible to print straight lines; for this reason, the lines being "bent" is a normal state.

Garth Brooks is the eponymous debut studio album of American country music artist Garth Brooks, released on April 12, 1989 through Capitol Nashville. It was both a critical and chart success, peaking at #13 on the "Billboard" 200. On the Top Country Albums chart the album peaked at #2 for eight weeks behind Clint Black's Killin' Time. In 2006 "Garth Brooks" was certified Diamond by the RIAA for shipments of 10 million copies in the US.
This album contains Brooks' earliest hits, for instance his first ever single, "Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)", which peaked at #8 on the Country Billboard Charts in 1989. It put the name of an independent cowboy singer, Chris LeDoux, into the mainstream due to the lyric "The worn out tape of Chris LeDoux" Two other strong starts include his first #1, "If Tomorrow Never Comes" and the Academy of Country Music's 1990 Song of the Year and Video of the Year, "The Dance" (another #1).
Brooks commented on the album, saying:

No Fences

No Fences is the second studio album by the American country music artist Garth Brooks. It was released on August 27, 1990, and reached #1 on "Billboard's" Top Country Albums chart. The album also reached #3 on the "Billboard" 200. On the latter chart it stayed in the top 40 for 126 weeks, only one week less than Shania Twain's "Come On Over", the Soundscan era's record holder. No Fences remains Brooks' best-selling studio album to date with 17 million copies shipped in the US, and is the album that made him an international star. It was his first album issued in Europe (the original European release contained the four singles from his U.S. debut as bonus tracks).
Some of Brooks' most famous songs appear on "No Fences", including: "The Thunder Rolls" (CMA's 1991 Video of the Year), "Friends in Low Places" (Academy of Country Music's 1990 Single of the Year), "Unanswered Prayers" and "Two of a Kind, Workin' on a Full House". A cover version of The Fleetwoods' "Mr. Blue" appears on the album. The album itself was named Album of the Year by the ACM in 1990. It reached Number 1 on the British country music charts (earning Brooks his first gold album in that country) and remained charted for over five years.
The track "Victim of the Game" was later covered by Brooks's friend and future wife Trisha Yearwood for her 1991 eponymous debut album.
Brooks later re-recorded the track "Wild Horses", and released the new recording as a single in early 2001, reaching #7 on the country chart.
Brooks commented on this album, saying:
"No Fences definitely, hands down would be the people's favorite album that we have done so far. It's by far our biggest selling album. With songs like Friends In Low Places, Two of a Kind, Unanswered Prayers, and especially The Thunder Rolls with all the attention it got with the video situation that it went through. It's probably not surprising that this is the biggest selling album of our collection. The number that we have sold surprises me to death, and this is a good time for me to say thanks to those people who have it. To those people who might be thinking about getting Fences, if you do, I hope that you don't feel like you've been let down. It's an album that I stand by, I'm very proud of. An album that I pull out from time to time and listen and hold my head up and say, yeah I'll still stand by it."
This track was not on the original release of the album. It first appeared when the album was re-released as part of Brooks' first "Limited Series" box set collection, and remained part of subsequent releases of the album until 2014, when it was released digitally for the first time.
"No Fences" peaked at #3 on the U.S. "Billboard" 200, and peaked at #1 on the Top Country Albums selling 238,000 copies, his first #1 Country album.

Micromoth

Micromoths, or microlepidoptera is a group of moth families. They are very common, but much smaller than the more familiar butterflies and moths. They have wingspans of under 20 mm, and are hard to see well enough to identify. 
They have some lifestyles different from the larger lepidoptera, but this is not an identifying mark. The group is not monophyletic, so the term 'micromoth' is just a convenient label. It can be contrasted with macrolepidoptera, the larger types.
