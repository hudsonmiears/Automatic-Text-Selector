The province also touches three other Kazakh provinces: Jambyl Province to the west, Karagandy Province to the northwest and East Kazakhstan Province to the north. Almaty Province has an area of 224,000 square kilometres. 
Alma-Ata Province, the predecessor of today's Almaty Province, was created from the historical region of Zhetysu on March 10, 1932. Its capital was Alma-Ata (Almaty). Several times during the Soviet period, the north-eastern part of the province, centered on Taldykorgan, was separated from Alma-Ata Province, forming a separate Taldy-Kurgan Province, only to be merged into Alma-Ata Province again several years later. 
In April 2001 the administrative center of Almaty Province was moved from Almaty to Taldykorgan. Thus Taldykorgan has become a provincial capital again - this time without splitting a province.

Bubbly Creek

Bubbly Creek is a nickname for the South Fork of the Chicago River's South Branch. It is the border between the Bridgeport and McKinley Park community areas of the city. The nickname for the creek comes from gases that bubbled out of the riverbed due to the decomposition of blood and entrails that were dumped in the river in the early 20th century by local meatpacking businesses that surrounded the Union Stock Yards.
Author Upton Sinclair wrote an exposé called "The Jungle", which was an unflattering portrait of the meat packing industry of America. In it, he wrote:
"""Bubbly Creek" is an arm of the Chicago River, and forms the southern boundary of the Union Stock Yards; all the drainage of the square mile of packing-houses empties into it, so that it is really a great open sewer a hundred or two feet wide. One long arm of it is blind, and the filth stays there forever and a day. The grease and chemicals that are poured into it undergo all sorts of strange transformations, which are the cause of its name; it is constantly in motion, as if huge fish were feeding in it, or great leviathans disporting themselves in its depths. Bubbles of carbonic gas will rise to the surface and burst, and make rings two or three feet wide. Here and there the grease and filth have caked solid, and the creek looks like a bed of lava; chickens walk about on it, feeding, and many times an unwary stranger has started to stroll across, and vanished temporarily. The packers used to leave the creek that way, till every now and then the surface would catch on fire and burn furiously, and the fire department would have to come and put it out. Once, however, an ingenious stranger came and started to gather this filth in scows, to make lard out of; then the packers took the cue, and got out an injunction to stop him, and afterwards gathered it themselves. The banks of "Bubbly Creek" are plastered thick with hairs, and this also the packers gather and clean.""

Nyala

The nyala ("Nyala angasii" or "Tragelaphus angasii"), also called inyala, is an antelope that lives in southern Africa. It has the highest sexual dimorphism among other spiral-horned antelopes.
The nyala is mainly active early in the morning and late in the afternoon. As a herbivore, the nyala eats leaves, fruits and grasses. They prefer water holes rather than open spaces. The nyala is not a territorial animal. Family groups of up to 10 individuals can be found. Old males live alone but family groups of up to ten members live in thickets within dense and dry savanna woodlands. The main predators of the nyala are lion, leopard and Cape hunting dog, while baboons and raptors hunt for the young. Mating peaks during spring and autumn.
Nyalas live in Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. They have been introduced to Botswana and Namibia, and reintroduced to Swaziland, where they became extinct in the 1950s. Populations are stable and are of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The main threats to the species are poaching and habitat loss resulting from human settlement. The males are highly demanded as game animals in Africa.

Comorbidity

In medicine the term comorbidity is used to describe diseases and conditions that often occur together with another disease or condition. The first disease or disorder is called "primary". In many cases, the primary condition or disease does not cause the comorbid disorders. However, they may both be caused or partly caused by the same thing, for example a genetic mutation or a traumatic experience. 
As an example, a patient may have antisocial personality disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The two conditions are "comorbid". Another patient might suffer from borderline personality disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder. The three conditions are "comorbid".

Interstate Highway System

The Interstate Highway System is a system of freeways in the United States. It was first designed by Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1950s. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 was used to pay for construction. It was mostly built from the 1950s through the 1980s. But more freeways were built later. It is now about 47,000 miles long. Some interstates have tolls, but most do not. Most interstates have rest areas every few dozen miles.
To be an Interstate Highway, there cannot be any stoplights. To get on or off the freeway, an interchange is needed. The speed limit is usually at least 55 miles per hour. It must have at least two lanes going each way. The lanes must be at least 12 feet wide. There has to be a median or barrier between cars going different directions.
North-south interstates have odd numbers. The numbers go up from west to east. East-west interstates have even numbers. The numbers go up from south to north. One and two digit freeways go long distances. Three digit freeways go into or around cities. Freeways that go into cites are called spur routes and start with an odd number. Freeways that go around cities are called loop routes and start with an even number. The last two digits in a spur or a loop route are the same as the freeway it started from.

Bland moved to Meridian to run a State Farm Insurance Agency.
In 2007, Bland was co-chair to pass a bond issue for the first major renovations and improvements to Meridian’s public schools in more than 20 years. The bond issue was for $19.5 million. The bond issue passed on March 27, 2007 with 71.3%.
Bland also helped establish the Magnolia Youth Sports Association. He still runs his own Summer Basketball Camp. Bland helped establish the First Tee Golf Program in Meridian, the first in the state, a golf program aimed at improving the quality of life of primarily inner-city children.
On June 4, 2013, Bland won the election for mayor of Meridian by 54% of the vote. Before he took office, he formed a team from the community to study five issues and make recommendations about how to move improve those areas in Meridian. The areas are education, community development, public safety, infrastructure and city partnerships. Bland was sworn in as the first African-American mayor of the city of Meridian on July 1, 2013.
During his first Meridian City Council meeting as mayor, on July 2, 2014, Bland proposed his livable wage policy. He proposed a $9 an hour minimum salary for all city employees. That was to be funded by money saved through cuts to other areas of the municipal budget. Bland's livable wage proposal became city policy when the city council passed the municipal budget on September 17, 2013.
Bland and several local businesses began recognizing an outstanding teacher or staff member from two MPSD schools a month during the 2013-14 school year. Improvements to public safety were made to the newly annexed part of Meridian. A new warning siren was put at the fire station in that area. Meridian youth sports were brought together through one program in the Meridian Parks and Recreation Department. The program brought in more mentors, more coaches, and more churches as partners for the City of Meridian to work with youth through athletics. In May 2014, the City of Meridian pledged $750,000 to help build a new community center.
In May 2014, the City of Meridian launched a series of new programs to help fight crime in the city. These included a new gang task force, a new team of Meridian police officers and citizens to help with tips on crime, and penalizing parents when their children do not comply with the Mississippi Compulsory School Attendance Law.

John Demjanjuk

John Demjanjuk (born Ivan Mykolaiovych Demianiuk; ; 3 April 1920 – 17 March 2012) was a Ukrainian-American auto worker, a former soldier in the Soviet Red Army, and a POW during the Second World War.
Demjanjuk was born in Ukraine. During World War II was drafted into the Soviet Red Army, where he was captured as a German prisoner of war. 
Although he was a survivor of the notorious Nazi concentration camps system, he was convicted in 2011 in Germany for alleged war crimes as an accessory to the murder of 27,900 Jews while acting as a guard named Ivan Demjanjuk at the Nazi extermination camp near Sobibór in occupied Poland. Since his conviction was pending appeal at the time of his death, Demjanjuk remains innocent under German law, and his earlier conviction is invalidated. According to the Munich state court, Demjanjuk does not have a criminal record.
In 1952 he emigrated from West Germany to the United States, and was granted citizenship in 1958 whereupon he formally anglicized his name from "Ivan" to "John".
In 1986 he was deported to Israel to stand trial for war crimes, after being identified by eleven Holocaust survivors, many from Israel, as "Ivan the Terrible", a notorious guard at the Treblinka extermination camp in Nazi occupied Poland. Demjanjuk was accused of committing murder and acts of extraordinarily savage violence against camp prisoners during 1942–43. He was convicted of having committed crimes against humanity and sentenced to death there in 1988. 
The verdict was overturned by the Israeli Supreme Court in 1993, based on new evidence that "Ivan the Terrible" was probably another man, Ivan Marchenko. After the trial, in September 1993, he returned to his home in Ohio. In 1998 his citizenship was restored after a United States federal appeals court ruled that prosecutors had suppressed exculpatory evidence concerning his identity.
In 2001 Demjanjuk was charged again, this time on the grounds that he had, instead, served as a guard named Ivan Demjanjuk at the Sobibor and Majdanek camps in Nazi occupied Poland and at the Flossenbürg camp in Germany. Demjanjuk became again a stateless person in 2002 (until his death in 2012). His deportation was again ordered in 2005, but after exhausting his appeals in 2008 he still remained in the United States, as no country would agree to accept him at that time. 
On 2 April 2009, it was announced that Demjanjuk would be deported to Germany, where he would stand trial, since in a bid to disassociate from the nation's past, Germany began the policy of prosecuting prisoners of war from other nations whom the German Nazis made the accessories to their crimes. On 11 May, Demjanjuk left his Cleveland home by ambulance, and was taken to the airport, where he was deported by plane, arriving in Germany the next morning. On 13 July, he was formally charged with 27,900 counts of acting as an accessory to murder, one for each person who died at Sobibor during the time he was alleged to have served as a guard. On 30 November, Demjanjuk's trial began in Munich.
On 12 May 2011, Demjanjuk was convicted pending appeal by an ordinary German criminal court as an accessory to the murder of 27,900 Jews at Sobibor and sentenced to five years in prison. The interim conviction was later annulled, because Demjanjuk died before his appeal could be heard. He was later released pending trial and final verdict by the German Appellate Court. 
He lived at a German nursing home in Bad Feilnbach, where he died on 17 March 2012. Despite decades of legal wrangling and controversy, Demjanjuk died a free man and legally innocent.

Rusty Cage

"Rusty Cage" is the third single off American rock band Soundgarden's third studio album "Badmotorfinger". The song was released in 1992.
Lead singer Chris Cornell wrote the lyrics of the song. Lead guitarist Kim Thayil said of the song: 
The tuning on that song was pretty nutty. It's recorded with a wah wah in the low position used as a filter. That was the first time we did anything like that. It was Chris's idea; he wanted to get that weird tone that you can't really dial in on an amp. But if you use the wah wah as a filter, it gets an incredibly weird sound. And if you listen to that riff, especially if you've heard the original demos of it, it almost sounds backward.
A popular cover version of the song was done by Johnny Cash, who included it on his 1996 album, "Unchained". The album won a Grammy Award for Best Country Album and Cash's version of Rusty Cage earned him a nomination for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 1998.

Lead guitarist Kim Thayil said of the song: 
I really liked the music to the song and it needed words, and since no one else pursued it, I decided to. It's not really about things that have actually happened to me. It's more about experience in general. I've heard a lot of good ideas from people telling me what it's about. They said it's about God, Satan, Jesus, Satan, both, it's religious, it isn't religious...The truth is, it's just me.

Evolution of colour vision

The evolution of colour vision causes light to be seen according to its wavelength. This has obvious advantages, especially it helps animals find food. 
The colour vision of many herbivores allows them to see fruit or (immature) leaves which are good to eat. In hummingbirds, particular flowers are often recognized by colour. Predators also use colour vision to help them find their prey.
All this applies mainly to animals in the daytime. On the other hand, nocturnal mammals have much less-developed colour vision. For them, space on the retina is better used with more rods since rods collect light better. Colour differences are much less visible in the dark.
Apart from vertebrates, the only land animals to have colour vision are arthropods. Aquatic arthropods such as crustacea also have colour vision. As with vertebrates, the details differ, but the molecules which do the work the opsins – are very similar.
Four photopigment opsins exist in teleost fish, reptiles and birds. This suggests that the common ancestor of tetrapods and amniotes (~360 million years ago) had:
In contrast, mammals lost much of their colour vision capability during the long period in the Mesozoic when they lived as nocturnal animals. 
Many primates do live as daytime animals, and one group – the Old World monkeys – has developed trichromatic vision. The anthropoid apes and humans are descended from this group of monkeys, and also have good colour vision. So it comes about that most monkeys and humans have good colour vision, but most other eutherian mammals do not: They have only two opsins, and are bichromatic.
Ultraviolet light plays a part in colour perception in many animals, especially insects. 
Colour vision, with UV discrimination, is present in many arthropods—the only terrestrial animals besides the vertebrates to have this trait.
Birds, turtles, lizards, many fish and some rodents have UV receptors in their retinas. These animals can see the UV patterns found on flowers and other wildlife that are otherwise invisible to the human eye.

Anopheles

Anopheles is a genus of mosquito. 
There about 460 species, and over 100 can transmit human malaria. Only 30–40 commonly transmit parasites of the genus "Plasmodium", which causes human malaria in endemic areas. "Anopheles gambiae" is one of the best known, because it transmits the most dangerous malarial parasite species (to humans) – "Plasmodium falciparum".
Some species of "Anopheles" are vectors for canine heartworm "Dirofilaria immitis", filariasis, and viruses such as one that causes O'nyong'nyong fever. Brain tumors sometimes occur in malaria sufferers, which suggests that "Anopheles" might transmit a virus or other agent which could cause a brain tumor.
Mosquitoes in other genera ("Aedes", "Culex", "Culiseta", "Haemagogus" and "Ochlerotatus") can also be vectors of disease agents, but not malaria.

United Church of Canada

The United Church of Canada is the largest Protestant Christian denomination in Canada, and the second largest Canadian Christian denomination after the Roman Catholic Church. It was started in 1925 when four Canadian churches decided to merge: the Methodist Church of Canada, the Congregational Union of Ontario and Quebec, two-thirds of the congregations of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, and the Association of Local Union Churches. In 1968, the Canadian branch of the Evangelical United Brethren Church decided to join the United Church of Canada.

These churches became orgainized into four denominations in the early 1800s. The four denominations merged in 1875 as the Presbyterian Church in Canada. It became one of the largets Protestant denominations in English-speaking Canada by the early 20th century. In 1925, 70% of the Presbyterian congregations merged into the United Church of Canada.

Hijra (Southern Asia)

The Hijras of Southern Asia, (, , , ) refers to individuals or humans in South Asia who are transsexual or transgender. Most South Asians think hijras are only "men who have feminine gender identity and wear women's clothing". However, some include female-to-male people also.
The word "hijra" is a Urdu-Hindustani word. It comes from the Semitic Arabic root "hjr". It has been borrowed into Hindi. The Indian usage has traditionally been translated into English as "eunuch" or "hermaphrodite", where "the irregularity of the male genitalia is central to the definition". However, in general, hijras are born with typically male physiology, only a few having been born with male intersex variations.

The Summit League

The Summit League is a NCAA conference that plays in the NCAA Division I. The member universities and colleges are in the Midwestern United States, plus one member in Colorado. Their headquarters are in the Chicago suburb of Elmhurst, Illinois
The league once sponsored football, but dropped the sport after the 1984 season. All four Summit League members that have football teams now play in the Missouri Valley Football Conference.
The Summit League was founded in 1982 as the Association of Mid-Continent Universities (AMCU or AMCU-8) with eight members. The only one of these schools that is still a member is Western Illinois. In 1989, the AMCU changed its name to the Mid-Continent Conference, or MCC (those initials, however, were also being used by the Midwestern Collegiate Conference, now the Horizon League).
The Mid-Continent saw many changes in the first part of the 1990s, with the biggest coming in 1992 and 1994. In 1992, the conference added women's sports after it absorbed the North Star Conference, a league that only sponsored women's sports. Then in 1994, six schools (including three charter members) left for the Midwestern Collegiate Conference. They were replaced by six other schools, five of them coming from the collapsed East Coast Conference. None of the schools that joined in 1994 are now in the league.
Since the 1994 changes, the conference has had anywhere from 8 to 10 members. It changed its name to The Summit League in 2007.
Currently, The Summit League has nine full members.
The Summit League has one "associate" member that plays three sports in the conference. (The NCAA counts men's and women's teams in the same sport as playing two different sports.)
No fewer than 21 schools have been full members, but are no longer in the league.

Jeanne d'Albret

Jeanne d'Albret (7 January 1528 – 9 June 1572), also known as Jeanne III d'Albret or Joan III, was the queen regnant of the Kingdom of Navarre from 1555 to 1572. 
Her second marriage to Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme, produced her son, Henry of Bourbon. Henry became King Henry III of Navarre and King Henry IV of France, the first Bourbon king of France. She became the Duchess of Vendôme by that marriage.
Jeanne was the acknowledged spiritual and political leader of the French Huguenot movement, and a key figure in the French Wars of Religion.
As a girl, she had a remarkably strong character. Her parents wanted her to marry William "the Rich", Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg. He was the brother of Anne of Cleves, the fourth wife of Henry VIII of England. She was 12 or 13 at the time, quite normal then for a girl's marriage. 
She refused, and her mother had her whipped. The whipping was extremely severe, but the girl continued to resist the marriage. Finally, she was carried bodily to the altar by the Constable of France, and married against her will. 
Evidently she still continued her resistance, because the marriage was eventually annulled on the grounds of non-consummation.
Her second marriage was also a political marriage. Its intent was to unify territory in the south and north of France. However, this time there was love involved. A contemporary wrote "she had no pleasure or occupation except in talking about or writing to [her husband]. She does it in company and in private . . . the waters cannot quench the flame of her love".
The couple had five children, two of whom survived to adult life.
On 25 May 1555, Henry II of Navarre died, at which time Jeanne and her husband became joint rulers of Navarre. Jeanne and Antoine were crowned in a joint ceremony according to the rites of the Roman Catholic Church on 18 August 1555 at Pau.
Jeanne's husband died on 17 November 1562, so for the last ten years of her life she was the sole ruler of Navarre.
During Jeanne's life, religion in France was a battleground between the Catholic church and the Protestant Calvinism of the Huguenots. 
In religion Jeanne was influenced by her mother, towards religious reform, humanist thinking, and individual liberty. Jeanne converted to Calvinism on Christmas Day 1560. This conversion made her the highest-ranking Protestant in France.
Following the imposition of Calvinism in her kingdom, priests and nuns were banished, Catholic churches destroyed, and Catholic ritual prohibited. She commissioned the translation of the New Testament into Basque and Béarnese for the benefit of her subjects.
She was described as "small of stature, frail but erect". She was highly intelligent, but austere and self-righteous. Agrippa d' Aubigné, the Huguenot chronicler, described Jeanne as having "a mind powerful enough to guide the highest affairs".
In addition to her religious reforms, Jeanne worked on reorganising her kingdom; making long-lasting reforms to the economic and judicial systems of her domains.
Jeanne died in Paris from a fever (probably an infectious disease) at the age of 44.

Tertiary source

A tertiary source (also called thirdhand) is an index or a summary of primary and secondary sources. In research, tertiary sources are used as a guide to help find primary and secondary sources of information. Tertiary sources are very useful to find search terms for online literary searches. While tertiary sources are easy to find they are usually not considered useful for college-level research projects.
Some examples of tertiary sources are encyclopedias, dictionarys, newspapers and Magazines. Encyclopedias are useful to gain a general overview of a subject. At best they are a starting point in doing research. They are useful to gain an immediate understanding of otherwise unfamiliar subjects. Encyclopedias, however, are not usually a reliable source for the details of a subject. As your research progresses they should be replaced with secondary or primary sources. Newspapers and magazines should be used with some caution. Some are reliable but many tend to misrepresent or oversimplify research reported in secondary sources. 
The distinction between sources can be relative to a specific field of study. In some academic disciplines the distinction between a secondary and tertiary source can sometimes be confusing. Almanacs, fact books and handbooks can at times be considered tertiary while at other times secondary sources. Some manuals and textbooks would be considered tertiary sources while others would be secondary sources. Many of these sources must be evaluated or vetted to determine which they are. Another view taken by the Purdue University guide ("Writing a research paper", 2010) refers to the "distance" a source is from the original research. A primary source "is" the research; the raw data. A secondary source reports on primary sources and includes interpretation (or explanations), analysis and commentary. A tertiary source is the furthest from the original research. In most cases their purpose is to provide a general introduction to a topic. In many scholarly fields, tertiary sources are not used for research.

Potato blight

Potato blight is the so-called "fungal" disease which destroyed the Irish potatoes in 1845. Because there are other blights of potatoes, this one is sometimes called late blight of potato.
The infestation caused widespread famine. It was caused by an oomycete "Phytophthora infestans". The oomycetes or water moulds have many features which are similar to fungi, but they are in a different Kingdom.
"Phytophthora infestans" in Ireland caused over one million to starve to death and another two million people emigrated from affected countries. During the 1840s the blight damaged crops in Scotland and Europe also. It was the only important cash crop in Ireland, which explains its greater effect there. Also, most of the Irish crop was one variety, the Irish Lumper.
The first recorded instances of the disease were in the United States, in Philadelphia and New York City in early 1843. It crossed the Atlantic Ocean with a shipment of seed potatoes for Belgian farmers in 1845. All of the potato-growing countries in Europe were affected, but the potato blight hit Ireland the hardest. The lack of genetic variability created a susceptible host population for the organism.
Genetic engineering for resistant cultivars is developing. A resistance gene effective against most known strains of blight has been found in a wild relative of the potato. It is introduced by genetic engineering into cultivated varieties of potato.

The word compendium comes from the Latin word "compenso". It means "to weigh together or balance". The Internet has large numbers of compendia in the form of databases.

Kulindadromeus

Kulindadromeus is a herbivorous dinosaur, an ornithischian from the Jurassic of Siberia, Russia.
The fossil shows clear signs of feather-like structures on its body. This is important because it was not known whether this group had proto-feathers. These structures probably had the function of temperature regulation: they were not flight feathers.
The original specimen was a partial skull with lower jaws. The volcanic ash layers of the formation form a "Konservat-Lagerstätte" with exceptional preservation. From 2010 onwards, more fossil material has been discovered, including subadult and juvenile individuals.
Specimens show large parts of its body surface (skin or 'integuent'). There are rows of scales on top of its tail and a covering of scales branching into feather-like structures. Until its discovery proto-feathers were thought to be only in the Theropoda. The feather remains discovered are of three types. 
The first type consists of hair-like filaments covering the trunk, neck and head. These are up to three centimetres long and resemble the "dino-fuzz" already known from theropods like "Sinosauropteryx". The second type shows groups of 1.5 centimetres-long filaments, each group coming from a base plate. These are on the upper arm and thigh. The base plates are ordered in a hexagonal pattern but do not touch each other. The third type is unique. It was found on the upper lower legs and consists of bundles of six or seven ribbon-like structures, up to two centimetres long. Each ribbon is made from about ten parallel filaments up to 0.1 millimetres wide.
The filaments earlier reported in Ornithischia, on "Psittacosaurus" and "Tianyulong", could be homologous to the "protofeathers" found in non-avian theropods. This would imply that feathers are original to the Dinosauria as a whole and possibly to the Archosauria as a whole, since there are similar structures in the Pterosauria.
There are also three types of scales. Overlapping hexagonal scales, up to 3.5 millimetres in diameter, are present on the lower shins. Small round non-overlapping scales, less than one millimetre in cross-section, cover the hands, ankles and feet. The top of the tail is covered by five long rows of arched rectangular scales, measuring up to one by two centimetres. With these scales the trailing edge of each scale slightly overlaps the front edge of the scale behind it. In the middle, to the contrary, a small spur projects forward, covering the trailing edge of the preceding scale. The authors think the scales were not ossified scutes or osteoderms.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (abbreviated BJP) is one the two largest political parties of India. (The other is the Indian National Congress). Since the Indian general election in 2014, the BJP has 282 seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India. 
The BJP's political beliefs are similar to the beliefs of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The RSS is a controversial organization in India accused of being Hindu nationalist.
The history of the Bharatiya Janata Party starts with the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (abbreviated BJS). The BJS was a political party created by Syama Prasad Mookerjee in 1951. At that time, the Indian National Congress was the political party that ruled India. The BJS's goal was to stop the Indian National Congress's policies. 
Many people thought the BJS was a part of the RSS because they had the same ideas on leading the Government of India. 
The party's first election campaign was about Kashmir. Kashmir was an area divided between India and Pakistan. The BJS wanted to make Kashmir a part of India. The party's founder, Mookerjee, was arrested for protesting in Kashmir, when he was ordered not to do so. He died in prison, so Deendayal Upadhyay became the party's leader.
Even though there was slight public support for the party because of the campaign about Kashmir, the BJS only managed to win three seats in the Lok Sabha in the 1952 elections.
In the 1967 Indian elections, many political parties, including the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, joined up together to win a majority of the seats of many Indian states, including Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh. This was the first time the BJS had held any political office.

The Red River Rebellion was an uprising by the Métis people in modern Manitoba. The national government of Canada bought the area, then known as "Rupert's Land", from the Hudson's Bay Company in 1869. The government then ordered surveys to be started of the new territory. The Metis were afraid that they would then lose their lands, since many did not have clear titles. They were also afraid that the Canadian government officials, many of which were Protestants, would not allow the Metis to continue being Catholics.
The Metis then orgainized their own provisional government, with Louis Riel as their leader, in the summer of 1869. They sent a list of demands to the Canadian government, including protection of the French language. After several months of negotiations, the Parliament of Canada passed the Manitoba Act of May 1870. The act admitted Manitoba into the Canadian Confederation and included many of the Metis' demands.

Top Thrill Dragster is a steel accelerator roller coaster built by Intamin at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio. It was the sixteenth roller coaster that was built at the park. It was the first roller coaster to be over tall and was the tallest roller coaster in the world before its record was broken by Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure when it opened in May 2005. Top Thrill Dragster, along with Kingda Ka, are the only strata coasters in the world.
After it leaves the station, the train enters the launch area. To the left of the launch area is a "Christmas tree" light, which is similar to a Christmas tree light at a drag strip. A message is then played to riders: "Keep arms down, head back, and hold on." Once the train is ready to launch, a motor revving sound effect is played and its magnetic braking fins are lowered from the launch track. The train is then launched from the track at a speed of in 3.8 seconds. After it reaches its top speed, it goes up at a 90 degree angle and climbs a hill, or top hat element. Once it goes down, the track twists 270 degrees before it levels out, and then it is stopped by magnetic brakes.
Sometimes, a train does not have enough speed to go over the hill. This is known as a rollback, and it usually happens during cool, wet, or breezy weather. It can also happen when the wind is blowing against the train. In these conditions, the launch doesn't give the train enough speed to go over the hill, which causes it to stop before reaching the top of the hill and then roll back down the hill, which is why it is called a rollback.
Sometimes, the train may stop at the top of the hill. When this happens, a mechanic takes an elevator to the top of the hill and pushes the train down the hill. This has only happened three times with passengers on board the train, June 24, 2005, October 25, 2008, and May 25, 2009.

Aortic aneurysm

An aortic aneurysm is a general term for an enlargement (dilation) of the aorta to greater than 1.5 times normal size. While the cause of an aneurysm may be unknown, the end result is weakness in the wall of the aorta at that location. 
The aneurysm may occasionally cause pain, which is a sign of impending rupture. When rupture occurs, massive internal hemorrhage results, and, unless treated immediately, shock and death can occur within minutes.

Radium girls

Radium girls were a group of female factory workers who sued their employer in 1917. 
These workers, at a factory on Orange, New Jersey, had to paint the dials of watches, so that the numbers on them would glow in the dark. The substance used to paint was luminous paint, which contained radium. Radium is radioactive, and causes radiation sickness. The workers used paintbrushes to draw fine lines; the brush would only draw such a line when it was wet, so it had to be licked very often. The women were told the paint was harmless. Over time, they ingested deadly amounts of it. 
Five workers sued their employer. The case that followed made it clear that people could sue their employer, if they contract occupational diseases.

Sock puppet (internet)

A sockpuppet is a false identity used on the Internet intended to hide a person's real identity. Another word to describe a sock puppet would be alter ego. Often a sock puppet identity is used to promote ideas or gather intelligence anonymously. Very often they are used by individuals on the Internet praising themselves while pretending to be someone else. Politicians have frequently been accused of using sock puppets. sockpuppets are designed to create political mischief (making fun of an opponent's position for example). It can make it appear many people hold a certain opinion, when in fact that is false. Many online communities attempt to block sockpuppets.
The term "sockpuppet" was used as early as July 9, 1993. By 1996 it was in general use. The "Oxford English Dictionary" at first defined it as "a person whose actions are controlled by another". In 2000 the U.S. News and World Report associated the word minion with a sock puppet. In 2006, an aide to a Republican congressman was caught posting messages on Democratic Party sites. Using a false identity the aide was trying to convince Democrats not to support a certain candidate.
A meatpuppet is similar to a sockpuppet, except a person joins users to a website, such as Wikipedia, to be used with sockpuppet behaviors. Such users are actually real individuals that come to support another user.

Harald Fairhair (c. 850 – c. 932) was the first King of Norway. According to traditions today in Norway and Iceland, during the 12th and 13th centuries, he was king from 872 to 930. Most of what we know about him comes from several sagas, written up to three centuries after he died.
He was the son of Halvdan the Black. Harald was the first petty king to gain control of the coastal areas of Norway. After the battle of Hafrsfjord in 872 Harald became king of most of Norway. It was the last of a series of battles between Harald and other feudal states in Norway. 
Because of Skaldic poems (poems honouring heroes in Scandinavia), we know that he was successful in fighting against his opponents in Norway. Eric Bloodaxe and Haakon the Good, his two sons, became King after he died of old age. 
Fairhair may have had as many as 11-20 sons according to different Sagas. Twelve of them became Kings and were all assigned land.

<doc id="458717" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=458717" title="Knowledge of results">
Knowledge of results

Knowledge of results is a term in the psychology of learning. A psychology dictionary defines it as feedback of information:
It describes the situation where a subject gets information which helps them to change behaviour in a desirable way, or to gain understanding. A primitive example is avoiding a behaviour after punishment. An advanced example is the way a human may improve understanding and behaviour after a teacher explains what was wrong with the previous effort.
There are a number of similar terms in psychology, but all of them have some problems.
So, knowledge of results, or sometimes "immediate" knowledge of results, is a useful term. It can be used for any learning where a student (or any animal) gets information after the action. The information is about how satisfactory the action is. 
An early experiment on knowledge of results was the machine invented by Sidney Pressey, where a device both tested and taught multiple-choice questions. Note that this method tells the user (by inference) only whether the choice was correct or not. Since the material was multiple choice items, it was only intended as an addition to collecting classroom test scores.
Later work in training research and education used the term "knowledge of results" frequently. 
An important question was whether scores would be improved more if direct teaching was given either before or after the question was asked. The answer in both cases was (broadly) yes. Using instructional films, Michael and Maccoby split groups into two halves. Half the students were given material which required active, explicit responses. After a pause, they were told the correct answer. The other half was not given feedback. Instructional time was identical. The result showed a "slight but significant gain" for the active-response procedure without feedback, but more gain when feedback was provided. The experimenters later described this as "KCR" rather than "feedback". Research on the active response itself is summarised in . Later discussion of experiments like these suggested that the results might be due to practice rather than feedback. Undoubtedly, the set-up had given extra practice on the questions as well as knowledge of results. In technical terms, the experiments had confounded the two factors. 
Another factor is that knowledge of results may give information to the instructor as to ways the material can be improved. Using a teaching program on decimal arithmetic, an experienced teacher can put student mistakes into types. For example, one group of mistakes are due to the learners not understanding the rules about placement of the point in decimal multiplication. This shows where and how the learning material needs to be revised. 
Conscious thought is not necessary for knowledge of results to have its effect. Research on implicit learning shows that complex information can be got by humans without their awareness. This is also shown by experiments on animal learning which show the effects of knowledge of results on later behaviour. It seems likely that unconscious learning by results evolved first in early metazoa, and conscious thought very much later. This is what Reber calls the "primacy of the implicit", meaning implicit (unconscious) learning came first in evolution.

Metatarsus

The metatarsus or metatarsal bones are a group of five long bones in the foot. They are between the tarsal bones of the hind and mid-foot and the phalanges of the toes. 
The metatarsal bones are numbered from the side of the large toe: the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal. They can be numbered with Roman numerals. The metatarsals are like the metacarpal bones of the hand.
The metatarsal bones are often broken by soccer players. This may be caused by the lightweight design of modern football boots, which give less protection to the foot. In 2010 some soccer players began testing a new sock that had a rubber silicon pad over the foot to protect the top of the foot.

Early settlement of Nelson began in the 1300s by the Māori. The region was lived in by the Māori. But there were no permanent settlements in the area until the first Europeans arrived in the early 1840s. Queen Victoria made it the seat of an Anglican Bishopric in 1858 and Nelson became a city. The city grew slowly until the 1950s when it developed suburbs. Nelson remains a compact city with most attractions within walking distance. The city's main landmark is Christ Church Cathedral, on Church Hill.

Al Brady

Al Brady (October 25, 1910 – October 12, 1937) was an armed robber and murderer. He became one of the FBI's "Public Enemies" in the 1930s. He and a partner in crime were shot dead in an ambush by FBI agents in downtown Bangor, Maine in 1937. 
Al Brady was born in Indiana in 1910. Both his parents died while he was still young. At age 18, he committed his first robbery in Indianapolis, Indiana. He was shot and wounded. After getting out of jail, he got together with a gang. Using guns, they stole cars and robbed places in Indiana; mostly grocery stores. They murdered a 23-year-old Indianapolis store clerk. Then they killed an Indianapolis policeman. After probably killing another police officer, the gang was put in jail in 1936. Brady and some of the gang escaped from jail and robbed a bank in Goodland, Indiana. While running away, they killed one policeman and injured another.
Brady and his gang ended up hiding out in Bangor, Maine. They had about $5,000 left from their robberies. Brady thought Maine would be an easy place to get guns and ammunition without questions being asked. This was because there are many deer and bear hunters in the area.
In Bangor, Brady began trying to buy automatic weapons at Dakin's Sporting Goods store, in downtown Bangor. On Sept. 21, 1937, Brady asked the owner, Everett Hurd, for 500 rounds of 30 calibre ammunition. Seeing a large amount of cash, the store owner became suspicious. Hurd called the police after taking their order. He told them to return in a few weeks to pick up their guns. 
Brady and his gang came back to the store on October 12, 1937. Many FBI agents were waiting in ambush, inside the store and across the street. One of the gang was caught by an FBI agent in the store. Brady and the other one drew their weapons in the street. They were shot down in a lot of gunfire.
Brady was killed by FBI agent Walter Walsh. Walsh was wounded, and recovered. He lived to be the FBI's oldest retired Special Agent.
Pictures of the bodies lying dead in the middle of the downtown street became locally famous. For many years, they could be looked at in Dakin's store. In the pictures, a large crowd of people is shown. It was Columbus Day, so people were already lining the streets to see a parade before the shooting began.
No one came to get Brady's body, because he did not have any family. He was buried in a grave without a headstone at Mount Hope Cemetery in Bangor. In 2007, the grave was finally marked with a stone, with a short funeral.

Swordsmanship

Swordsmanship refers to the skills of a "swordsman". It is a modern term mainly used to refer to small sword fencing. But it can also be applied to any martial art involving the use of a sword. The English word "swordsman" is parallel to the Latin word "gladiator". This was a professional fighter who fought against other fighters and others for the entertainment of spectators in the Roman Colosseum. The word "gladiator" itself comes from the Latin word "gladius", meaning "sword". 
Japan's greatest swordsman, Miyamoto Musashi won sixty duels. His classic book on swordsmanship is called the Book of Five Rings, written about 1645.
William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke was called "the greatest knight who ever lived". He was one of England's greatest swordsmen.
Guy Chabot, Seigneur de Jarnac was famous as France's finest swordsman. He won by a slashing blow to his opponent's buttocks so he could no longer stand. Winning a duel using this method has since been called a "coup de Jarnac".
Italo Santelli was a great Italian fencing master (teacher). His fencing styles made Italians the best swordsmen in Europe by the end of the 19th century. He established and taught fencing in Hungary for over fifty years. By the 20th century his Hungarian fencers were the best in Europe. He was given a knighthood for his contributions to the sport in Hungary.

Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916

The Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916 were a series of shark attacks along the coast of New Jersey between July 1 and July 12, 1916. Four people were killed and one injured. 
Since 1916, scholars have debated which shark species was responsible and the number of animals involved. The Great white shark and the Bull shark are mostly thought to be the shark species being blamed for the attack. The attacks happened during a deadly summer heat wave and polio epidemic in the Northeastern United States. It drove thousands of people to the seaside resorts of the Jersey Shore. 
The shark attack led many meetings about public awareness in congress by the United States House of Representatives and by President of the United States Woodrow Wilson.
Shark attacks on the Atlantic Coast of the United States outside the semitropical states of Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas were rare, but scholars believe that the increased presence of sharks and humans in the water led to the attacks in 1916.

Ohio Valley Conference

The Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) is an American college sports conference that plays in the NCAA Division I. In football, the OVC is part of Division I FCS, the lower of two levels of Division I football. The member universities and colleges are in Alabama, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee. The OVC has its offices in the Nashville suburb of Brentwood, Tennessee.
The OVC grew out of talks between officials at three Kentucky schools—Eastern Kentucky, Murray State, and Western Kentucky—in 1941. America's entry into World War II later that year put these talks on hold for several years. Later, in 1948, the three original schools joined with two other Kentucky schools, plus one in Indiana, to form the conference.
It was one of the first conferences with a presence in the South to accept black athletes at historically white-only schools, with Morehead State being the first OVC member to do so in 1958. Today, the OVC is notable as being the only conference made up of traditionally white schools to have a historically black university (HBCU) as a member, namely Tennessee State. That school is also the only HBCU with a Division I sports program that plays in a conference that is not made up entirely of such schools.
The OVC's current membership of 12 is the largest in its history.
The OVC has 12 full members. Nine of these schools play football in the OVC; one plays football in another conference; and two do not play football at all. All members are public schools except for the league's newest member, Belmont.
The OVC has one "associate" member—i.e., a school that plays a sport in the OVC that its main conference does not sponsor.
Nine schools have been full members, but are no longer in the league.

The Centennial Olympic Park bombing was a terrorist bomb attack on the Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta, Georgia on July 27 during the 1996 Summer Olympics. The blast claimed 1 life and injured 111 people, while another person died of a heart attack. 
It was the first of four bombings committed by Eric Robert Rudolph. Security guard Richard Jewell discovered the bomb before detonation and cleared most of the spectators out of the park. 
Rudolph, a carpenter and handyman, had detonated three pipe bombs inside an ALICE Pack. Motivated by "abortion on demand," Rudolph wanted to force the cancellation of the Olympics.
After the bombings, Jewell was implicated as a suspect by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The news media focused aggressively on him as the presumed culprit. However, in October 1996, Jewell was cleared of all charges. Following three more bombings in 1997, Rudolph was identified by the FBI as the suspect. 
In 2003, Rudolph was arrested and tried before being convicted two years later. Rudolph was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for his crimes.

Hurricane Iselle (2014)

Hurricane Iselle was a Pacific tropical cyclone. The storm threatened the islands of Hawaii, especially Hilo. The storm developed on July 31, 2014. Iselle is the first hurricane to hit the islands in 22 years. 
Iselle approached Hawaii as a powerful category 4 hurricane. It had sustained winds of about 120 knots (138 mph). A number of conditions caused it to weaken just before it approached Hawaii. It struck the Big Island as a strong tropical storm. The storm center made landfall at about 2:30 am on August 8. It left downed trees and about 25,000 people without electric power. The storm surge caused 25-foot waves. Airlines had to cancel about 50 flights due to the storm.
Iselle then followed a northwestern track missing the rest of the Hawaiian islands. They received rain and winds. A woman hiker on Kauai was swept away and drowned in the storm.

Word salad

Word salad is language with meaningless, scrambled words. It is a "confused or unintelligible mixture of seemingly random words and phrases". 
'Word salad' is most often used for a symptom of a neurological or mental disorder. The words may or may not be grammatically correct. The key thing is that a listener cannot get any meaning from them. The term is often used in psychiatry and theoretical linguistics to describe language which native speakers judge is meaningless.
Word salad occurs in neurological or psychological cases in which a person tries to communicate, and words and phrases come out but make no sense. Often, the person is unaware that they did not make sense. It appears in people with dementia and schizophrenia, and after anoxic brain injury.
It may be present as:
Word salad can be generated by a computer program for various purposes.
Mojibake, also called "Buchstabensalat" ("letter salad") in German, is an effect similar to word salad, in which an assortment of seemingly-random text is generated.

Karen X. Gaylord

Karen X. Gaylord (January 4, 1921 - August 1, 2014) was an American actress, model, and former Miss Minnesota, whose career was most successful during the 1940s.
She was born Karen Xandra Gaylord on January 4, 1921, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to a working class family. She was the oldest of four children (all girls). Her father worked as an engineer with the Northern Pacific Railway. 
After she graduated from North Community High School in 1939, Gaylord wanted to go to college to study music and art. But then a friend of hers saw a notice in a magazine called "Movie Mirror." It said that the movie studios in California were accepting photographs with names and addresses to help them find new actors for movies. Without telling Gaylord, her friend mailed in Gaylord's picture. Not long after, Gaylord got a letter telling her that she had been chosen to come to California for a tryout.
The entire Gaylord family decided this would be a good chance for all of them. The whole family moved to California with Karen. 
After moving to California, Karen began going to all of the major studios in Hollywood, doing screen and wardrobe tests (tryouts to see how she acted and looked on movie screens and in costumes). 
In 1941, Gaylord was in her first film, "The Chocolate Soldier" with Nelson Eddy (though she was not listed in the credits at the end of the movie). Between 1941 and 1949, she acted in about 36 films (see the "Filmography" section lower on this page). But she was only listed in the credits for these movies once, for the 1944 film "Cover Girl" with Rita Hayworth.
In 1942, the Chamber of Commerce of Minneapolis, Minnesota, chose Gaylord as their 1942 'Miss Minnesota.' Not long after this, film producer Samuel Goldwyn chose Karen to become one of his six new Goldwyn Girls. (The Goldwyn Girls were a group of female dancers that included some very famous women.) 
Gaylord also became a popular stand-in, and stood in place for leading ladies like Linda Darnell, Barbara Stanwyck, Laraine Day, Evelyn Keyes, Gene Tierney, and Jeanne Crain. (A stand-in plays an actor's role when the actor is not there.)
In 1949, Gaylord left the entertainment industry. She moved to Clearwater, Florida, to begin her lifelong dream of teaching music and art. In 1950, she legally changed her name from Karen Xandra Gaylord to Jane Goerner. 
Up until the 1990s, she gave private music and art lessons out of her home. 
In the last years of her life, she had some serious health problems. She sold her home and moved to Ocala, Florida, to live with her sister and brother-in-law. She died in her sleep at the age of 93 on August 1, 2014. There were no funeral services or memorials. Her body was donated to medical science through the body donation program at the University of Florida's College of Medicine.

Richard Virenque

Richard Virenque (born 19 November 1969) is a French retired professional cyclist. He was one of the most popular French riders. He won the King of the Mountains competition of the Tour de France seven times, which is more than any other cyclist. Virenque finished third in the Tour de France in 1996 and second in 1997.
He was part of a famous doping scandal in 1998.
He rode for the Vélo Club Hyèrois from the age of 13. He said he knew he could climb well from the start.
His first win was in a race round the town at La Valette-du-Var. He and another rider, Pascale Ranucci, lapped everyone else. He then did his national service in the army battalion at Joinville in Paris.
In 1990 he came eighth in the world championship road race at Utsunomiya, Tochigi in Japan. He was then offered a professional contract with the team RMO.
He turned professional for RMO in January 1991.
Virenque rode his first Tour de France in 1992 as a replacement for Jean-Philippe Dojwa. On the third day he took the maillot jaune of leadership and held it for a day, losing it to his team-mate Pascal Lino, who led for the next two weeks. Virenque finished second in the polka dot jersey climbers' competition.
After the Tour de France Virenque joined another French team, Festina. He stayed there until the team closed down after a doping scandal in 1998.
Virenque first wore the yellow jersey of the Tour de France in 1992 and for the last time in 2003. In 2003 he wore the jersey on the climb of Alpe d'Huez.
Virenque was good at climbing but not at time trials.
In 1998 the Festina cycling team was disgraced by a doping scandal, known as the "Festina affair".
Virenque's teammates, Christophe Moreau, Laurent Brochard and Armin Meier, admitted taking EPO after being arrested during the Tour and were disqualified. Virenque said he was innocent.
Virenque changed teams to Team Polti in January 1999. He rode the Giro d'Italia in 1999 and won a stage.
A few weeks later Virenque's name emerged in an inquiry into Bernard Sainz. Sainz was later jailed for practising as an unqualified doctor. Franco Polti, the head of Virenque's team, fined him 30 million lire.
Race director Jean-Marie Leblanc banned Virenque from the 1999 Tour de France. He was made to let Virenque race by the Union Cycliste Internationale. Leblanc said he hoped Virenque would not win. Virenque rode on a bicycle painted white with red dots to resemble the polkadot jersey of best climber, but he didn't win the competition. He had a bodyguard, Gilles Pagliuca.
In 1999 he wrote a book called "Ma Vérité". In the book he said he was innocent of doping. He wrote that his team-mates confessed to using EPO because of pressure from the police. He said Moreau's urine showed EPO had not been detected.
The Festina affair led to a trial in October 2000. Virenque was a witness as well as others from the Festina team. He at first denied he had doped himself but then confessed. But he denied doping himself intentionally.
Virenque was criticised by the media and satirists for denying doping even though there was evidence. He was also criticised for pretending he had been doped without his knowledge.
Virenque lived near Geneva in Switzerland and the Swiss cycling association suspended him for nine months. The sentence was reduced by an independent tribunal to six and a half months. He was fined the equivalent of 2,600 euros and told to pay 1,300 euros in costs. He became depressed.
It was difficult for Virenque to find a team after he returned from his suspension.
On 5 July 2001 he joined Domo-Farm Frites. He had help from Eddy Merckx who paid the extra money after the main sponsors wouldn't pay. Domo kept him the following season. On 25 October 2002 he signed for another two years.
Virenque returned to fame by winning Paris–Tours on 7 October 2001. This was unusual because Paris–Tours is a flat race and sprinters usually win, not climbers. The French magazine, "Vélo", called the victory "extraordinary." "L'Équipe" 's headline on the front page was "Unbelievable!"
Virenque was beaten by Laurent Jalabert in the 2001 and 2002 Tour de France King of the Mountains competition. He won his sixth polka dot jersey in 2003. In 2004 he won the polka dot jersey for the seventh time. This is the most of any cyclist.
Virenque rode the Olympic Games road race in Athens. He announced his retirement on 24 September 2004.
He won "Je suis une célébrité, sortez-moi de là!" (the French version of "I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!") in Brazil in April 2006. In autumn 2005 he opened Virenque Design, a company to design and sell jewellery. Since 2005 he has been a commentator for Eurosport. He has also advertised an energy drink and a pharmacy company.
In December 2007, Virenque and his wife, Stéphanie, divorced. They had been together for 17 years. They have two children, Clara and Dario.
Virenque lives at Carqueiranne in the Var region of France. He likes dancing, wine, gardening and flowers. "Put me in a good garden nursery and I'm in heaven," he says.

Johann Pestalozzi

Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (12 January 1746 – 17 February 1827) was a Swiss pedagogue and educational reformer. He was a humanist and romantic in his approach.
He founded several schools in German and French-speaking regions of Switzerland, and wrote explaining his principles of education. His motto was "Learning by head, hand and heart". 
In 1780 Pestalozzi published anonymously a series of aphorisms, entitled "The Evening Hours of a Hermit". They are his earliest works which outline ideas that would later be known as Pestalozzian. 
He drew from these experiences and published four volumes of a story titled "Leonard and Gertrude". These four volumes are about the lives of four characters: Gertrude, Glüphi, an unnamed parish clergyman and Arner. Gertrude is a wife and mother who teaches her children how to live moral upstanding lives. Glüphi, a school teacher, sees the success Gertrude has with her children and tries to model his school around her teachings. A parish clergyman also adopts Gertrude's teachings. The work of Gertrude, Glüphi and the clergyman are helped by Arner, a politician, who gets help from the state. Through these four, harmony is achieved and a comprehensive education is offered to all people.
His next endeavor, "Enquiries into the course of nature in the development of the human race", was not so popular. His education was built on the idea that all understanding can be achieved through a psychologically ordered sequence of learning.
Pestalozzi's method was used by the cantonal school in Aarau that Albert Einstein attended. It has been credited with helping Einstein's process of visualizing problems and his use of thought experiments. Einstein said of his education at Aarau: "it made me clearly realize how much superior an education based on free action and personal responsibility is to one relying on outward authority."

John George Bartholomew

John George Bartholomew (22 March 1860 - 14 April 1920) was a British cartographer and geographer. Because he had a royal warrant, he used the name "Cartographer to the King". He is also known as "the Prince of Cartography."
Bartholomew is best known for naming the continent Antarctica, which before was ignored because of its lack of resources and bad weather.
Bartholomew came from a family of great map-makers. He was the son of Scottish cartographer John Bartholomew Junior and grandson of the founder of a very popular map-making company named John Bartholomew and Son Ltd.
Bartholomew helped make John Bartholomew and Son Ltd. one of the best in the business. During this time, he also introduced the use of colored contour layer maps; he also helped future travelers by making many maps of major cities, railroads, and so on.
He worked with major scientific figures and travelers on projects involving their studies. During his life, he worked on an Atlas of Meteorology and Atlas of Zoo geography, however, he never finished. Before he died he was able to plan out the first edition of the Times Survey Atlas of the World; which would later become the most successful atlas project of the twentieth century.
Bartholomew received the Victoria Research Gold Medal and Helen Carver medal. He was also put in the Royal Geographical Society.

Nimrod Expedition

The British Antarctic Expedition 1907–09 was also called the Nimrod Expedition. It was the first of three expeditions to the Antarctic led by Ernest Shackleton. The point of the journey, was to reach the South Pole. They did not reach the South Pole. They made it 180.6 kilometers (or 112.2 miles) away from their destination. This was the farthest journey to that date. The group was also the first to climb Mount Erebus.
When the group returned, they nearly became worldwide hero's. Shackleton received many awards. These included a knighthood from King Edward VIII. Three years later, the group's record was broken by another group led by Edgeworth David.

Cercopithecinae

The Cercopithecinae are an important subfamily of Old World monkeys. There are 12 genera and about 71 species. the baboons, the macaques and the vervet monkeys. 
Most of then live in sub-Saharan Africa, but the macaques range from the far eastern parts of Asia through northern Africa, and Gibraltar.
The various species are adapted to the different terrains they inhabit. Tree-dwelling (arboreal) species are slim, delicate and have a long tail. Ground-dwelling species are heavier, and their tail may be small or nonexistent. All species have well-developed thumbs. 
Like many Old World monkeys, they have pads on their bottoms. These are called "ischial callosities". They let the monkeys sleep sitting upright on thin branches, beyond reach of predators, without falling off. In some species, these pads change their colour during the mating period.
These monkeys are active in the daytime, and live together in social groups. They live in all types of terrain and climate, from cool mountains to rain forests, savannah, bald rocky areas or even snowy mountains, as does the Japanese macaque.
Most species are omnivorous, with diets ranging from fruits, leaves, seeds, buds, and mushrooms to insects and spiders to smaller vertebrates. All species have cheek pouches in which they can store food. 
Gestation lasts approximately six to seven months. Young are weaned after three to 12 months and are fully mature within three to five years. The life expectancy of some species can be as long as 50 years.

Sodium cyclamate

Sodium cyclamate is an artificial sweetener. It is 30 to 50 times sweeter than sugar. Even though other artificial sweeteners are more potent, sodium cyclamate is often used because of its taste, which is close to natuarally occurring sugar. Some studies have found that sodium cyclamate causes cancer. For this reason, its use is forbidden in the United States. In the European Union, the use in certain kinds of products is limited (to a maximal dose).

Token Ring

Token Ring is a networking protocol for Local area networks. It uses a token at the data link layer. The token has two states, either it is free, or it is taken, and data follows. When a computer has a message to send, it appends the message to the token, and sets the token state to taken. Each workstation along the ring sees the message. If the workstation was the recipient of the message, it sends a new empty token, otherwise it passes the token along. Since the only way to send data is to wait for an empty token, there will be no collisions.
Token Ring was mainly used by IBM in the 1970s to 1990s, today, Ethernet has replaced it in many applications.

Are you all ready to start quickly deleting transwikied articles for lack of attribution? Although we haven't done that before (at least not that I've seen), they seem to qualify. I think it might be worth a notice at Simple Talk before we start routinely doing this. Thoughts? -- () 00:01, 12 August 2014 (UTC)
I really think we admins need to be consistent about this, and right now we're not. I see at least one admin deleting on these grounds due to lack of attribution, and another admin declining such QDs. It's not fair to the editors to be inconsistent like that. Would all the admins please weigh in here? The only comments so far have been about being unsimplified, which is not the point of this discussion. The point is whether attribution is given. -- () 20:24, 14 August 2014 (UTC)
I am with Auntof6 on this. The requirement for copyright is originality of thought. A simple listing of data is not copyrightable in and of itself. The template itself (ie the formating) is and the attribution for that would be on the template page not the individual articles. Infoboxes are completely fair game to copy over. As are in most cases table which are laid out in a manor which would be expected of them. I forget the exact legal wording off the top of my head but basically anything that is done in a manor that many people could be expected to lay that data out if they all did it without knowledge of anyone else doing it is not copyrightable. An example (thought not of a table). But a sentence like "An apple is a fruit." or "Paris is the capital city of France." are not copyright eligible. As for the table you copied over, you don't even need a template from that. As long as you put in your edit history that you copied it from the english wiki article then you are covered by the attribution requirement. - () 11:32, 15 August 2014 (UTC)

OK, there has been a lot of discussion. We have to be consistent, one way or the other, or it's not fair to the editors.

Could there possibly be some other option or gadget that I need to turn off or on that is interfering? () 11:59, 22 August 2014 (UTC)
Recent developments, a no consensus vote on using G12 for lack of attribution and three test cases submitted for RfD, have shown we don't have an effective policy in place. In discussions, it's been suggested an editor can place attribution on a page for another editor, but I'm no longer sure this is the case. By placing the attribution on a talk page (or in an edit comment), you "might" justify keeping the article (frequently unsourced stubs), but the originator still violated copyright law by not placing the attribution there themselves. For example, you can pay someone else's fine for speeding, but they still are responsible for the offense (and the points against their license) themselves. They may also have created a violation of our agreement with WMF. A serial copyright infringer is unquestionably a liability to this wiki. Allowing this to continue also undermines efforts to get new users to comply with attribution on transwikied pages. Why would they comply if it gets ignored or someone else does it for them (sometimes) and there is no penalty? Then, why follow "any" other rules here?
The 2007 [Resolution:Licensing policy], begins with the statement: "This policy is approved by the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees to apply to all Wikimedia projects. It may not be circumvented, eroded, or ignored by local policies." In the resolution itself, it does not offer an alternative to deletion of files uploaded under an unacceptable license (acceptable licenses, including free content licenses are defined under the section Free content licenses). 
Unless I'm wrong, our Exemption doctrine policy is still in development. If so, is a provision for another editor to step in and attribute an uploaded file under CC BY-SA 3.0 even an option? Or would this be a case of circumventing the WMF licensing policy? 
In WMF's Terms of Use, two provisions would seem to apply to this situation. First, under § 7 c. Importing text: "<mark>You</mark> agree that, if you import text under a CC BY-SA license that requires attribution, <mark>you</mark> must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion. Where such credit is commonly given through page histories (such as Wikimedia-internal copying), it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is recorded in the page history, when importing the text. The attribution requirements are sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of the license), and there may be instances where the Wikimedia community decides that imported text cannot be used for that reason." It doesn't say you or someone else, it says "you". Secondly, under § 8. DMCA Compliance: "The Wikimedia Foundation wants to ensure that the content that we host can be re-used by other users without fear of liability and that it is not infringing the proprietary rights of others. In fairness to our users, as well as to other creators and copyright holders, our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the formalities of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Pursuant to the DMCA, we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and network who are repeat infringers." 
For an example, one editor alone has something like 175 unattributed articles (spot checking indicates most are transwikied articles) and refuses to comply. After some reading at WMF and enwiki's copyright policy, I'm not convinced it is permissible for another editor to attribute for someone who fails to do it themselves. Also, if an editor takes the responsibility upon themselves to attribute one or two articles for an infringing editor, aren't they then responsible for all the non-attributed articles the infringer created? I'm perfectly willing to encourage new editors to attribute and, before I looked into this at the WMF, to attribute for them as an example. Attributing for someone who refuses to do it themselves (if deemed permissible) "might" save some stubs, but at the same time seems to be encouraging the user to ignore policy. This is a small wiki and nothing goes unnoticed here for very long. We seem to be between a rock and a hard place (current practice versus the policies of WMF and Simplewiki). Why would a patroller even nominate a page for deletion (for lack of attribution) if in many cases it will be declined? Why would a patroller place a warning message on a new user's talk page if they don't know if an administrator will support them, or make them (and the policy) look foolish? Is there any way we can get some kind of agreement on what this wiki will do about this problem? () 17:12, 26 August 2014 (UTC)

Hi there, User Stylefume is a sock operator at the English Wikipedia with an incessant history of disruptive editing. Without burdening the noticeboard with too much detail, the obvious indicator is that the user has injected "Jetania", a fictional nation of his own creation, into articles, and it appears also in his sandbox: . Here is the SPI archive at the English Wikipedia, and here is another operator who is generally assumed to be the same person or a confederate. At the English Wikipedia, any account that adds "Jetania" to articles is typically indeffed as soon as it is discovered. When the user isn't vandalizing articles, they tend to use Wikipedia as a free hosting platform for make-believe edits, for example here where we learn in his sandbox that his make-believe movie theater has reasonably priced popcorn. Not an encyclopedic contribution. Recommending indef. User has zero consistent history of contributing constructively to the project, and no edits from this user can be assumed as being made in good faith. User is believed to be based in Aberdeen Scotland, and occasionally uses IPs from there, or general Sky IPs that geolocate to central England. Regards, () 05:53, 6 November 2014 (UTC)

Hello-
Apologies in advance if this is in the wrong place. I flagged a page for deletion recently because I felt the entry was for a person who did not meet the notability standards of Wikipedia and that the page had been created for personal promotion. The subject of this entry is now threatening to sue me for nominating the page for deletion. I just want to make sure that there is no legal grounds for this. Perhaps relevant is the fact that the person in question tried to hire me to create the page and when I said no, sent me angry emails and then found someone else to do it. At any rate, I just want to be clear that I flagged the page not out of spite, but because I thought it was questionable/borderline in terms of notability and should be reviewed. I don't think I have violated any of Wikipedia's terms of use in doing this, but wanted to inquire just in case I am contacted by a lawyer about this matter. Thank you for your time.

Could an admin please look and possibly remove this offensive edit summary located here: Thanks. 14:44, 10 January 2015 (UTC)
I'd like to remind my fellow admins about a glitch in the delete process. When an RfD is created in one year (for example, 2014) but closed as deleted in the following year (for example, 2015), the usual generated close reason in the dropdown menu is inaccurate. That's because the text for that reason is formed using the year when the close is done (for example, 2015), but the RfD page contains the year that the request was created (for example, 2014). To get the right link in the edit summary, we need to manually enter the close reason when deleting these. -- () 08:11, 1 January 2015 (UTC)

<doc id="459746" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=459746" title="Service oriented architecture">
Service oriented architecture

Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a concept in computer programming. It is a way of creating a program or application that is focused around distinct tasks or services. With an SOA model, each piece of the program or application performs a specific task (such as retrieving a piece of data, performing a mathematical operation, etc). The tasks are performed completely independent of each other.
Since each component of the program works independently, each component can be tested by itself without needing the whole program to be completed first. The program can be built piece by piece with confidence that each piece works.
Often times, a company has already created a program or application to perform a specific task. If that is the case, this legacy program, (program that has already been written) or a piece of this legacy program can be reused without the need to re-code that specific task. Consequently, programs with SOA can be developed faster than traditional programs in some circumstances.
The benefit of this is that unlike in a big combined program, each task is isolated so it is easy to manage and troubleshoot the program after completion. If there is a problem, a developer can check each service component systematically until the problem is detected. After it is detected, only that one small service would need to be fixed as opposed to a much larger section of a combined application

Catalepsy

Catalepsy is a nervous condition. The body is fixed, with rigid muscles and fixed posture. The body position does not respond to stimuli, and there is decreased sensitivity to pain.
Catalepsy is a symptom of certain nervous disorders or conditions such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. It is also a characteristic symptom of cocaine withdrawal. It may be caused by schizophrenia treatment with anti-psychotics such as haloperidol. It may be caused by the anaesthetic ketamine. In some cases, catalepsy may be started by an extreme emotional shock – one well known example of this was the reaction of 1968 Olympic long jump medalist Bob Beamon on finding he had broken the previous world record by over 0.5 meters (2 feet). Protein kinase A has been suggested as a mediator of cataleptic behavior.

Mental state examination

The mental status examination, MSE, is an important step in a "clinical assessment" of an individual. The purpose of the MSE is to get an over-all description of the patient's mental state. This, with information about the person, lets the clinician make a diagnosis. Then a plan is chosen for the person's treatment.
The examination is a way of describing a patient's current state of mind. Some parts of the MSE are done by observing, asking questions and noting; some parts are done using psychological tests. It works by looking at attitude, behavior, mood and "affect" (feeling), speech, thinking, perception, cognition, insight and judgment.
The MSE is different from the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), which is a brief test for dementia.

Ryutin Affair

The Ryutin Affair began in the summer of 1932 in the Soviet Union. Martemyan Ryutin was a right-wing communist. He wrote a 200 page document called the "Ryutin platform". In it he criticized Joseph Stalin's leadership of the communist party. Twelve or so party members met with Ryutin and read the document. This was in August of 1932. They passed it on to other party members. Stalin thought Ryutin and his friends were trying to have him assassinated. Ryutin was arrested. When Stalin tried to have him executed, he was instead sent to a labor camp for ten years. Every party member who read the document was arrested. In 1933 as many as 800,000 were arrested. In 1934 another 340,000 were sent to camps. This shows that Stalin did not yet have enough power to order Ryutin's execution. But by 1937 things had changed. After a 40 minute trial on 1 January 1937 Ryutin was executed.

<doc id="459864" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=459864" title="Sphynx cat">
Sphynx cat

The Sphynx is a breed of cat. It does not have much hair or fur on its body, but it is not truly hairless. The skin is soft because it has a fine layer of down. It may or may not have whiskers. The skin is the color the fur would be. This cat has all the same coat patterns found on other cats, such as a calico or tabby. The pattern is just seen on the Sphynx skin. Because they have no coat, they lose more body heat than cats with fur. This makes them feel warm when touched. They also like to seek sun or warm places because they are naturally cold.
The Sphynx was not the first hairless domestic cat. Some were seen in other places around the world for at least 90 years.
The Sphynx breed began in 1966, in Toronto, when a hairless kitten, named Prune, was born to a black and white shorthair cat, named Elizabeth, in Ontario, Canada. The kitten was mated with its mother, so one more naked kitten was born. Along with a few naked kittens found later, the hairless breed began.
A natural birth of a Sphynx cat happened on a Minnesota farm. The owners found hairless kittens in several litters of their domestic shorthair barn cats in the mid-1970s. Two hairless female kittens born in 1975 and 1976, named Epidermis and Dermis, were also an important part of developing the breed. More hairless cats were found in Texas, Arkansas, and Minnesota. So, the modern Sphynx breed began with the Canadian cats and the Minnesota cats.
The first breeders did not know much about cat genetics and they had some problems. The gene pool was small and many kittens died. Many of the females had seizures.
Sphynxes are friendly and not shy. They have a lot of energy, intelligence, curiosity, and love for their owners. They are one of the more dog-like breeds of cats. They run and greet their owners at the door and are friendly when meeting strangers.
Even though Sphynx cats do not have a coat to be brushed, they do need a bath once a week to wash off oils that get on their skin. They should not be left outside and need to be an indoor cat. First, sunlight can give them a sunburn. Secondly, they cannot keep warm when outside, so some owners dress them in warm clothes in the winter.

Oshkosh, Wisconsin

Oshkosh is a city in Winnebago County, Wisconsin, United States. It is located where the Fox River enters Lake Winnebago from the west. The population was 66,083 at the 2010 census. The city is located adjacent to and partially within the Town of Oshkosh.
In 1670, a French priest, Jean Claude Allouez, landed his canoe in what is now Menominee park in Oshkosh. He came to hold mass for the Indians. European settlers came to the area as early as 1818 and a trading post was set up. By 1837 the small community became known as 'Athens'. In an election in 1840 the name was changed to honor (or flatter) the Menominee chief Oshkosh (meaning 'claw' or 'brave'). Oshkosh became a city in 1853.
In 1847 the first Sawmill began making lumber. Soon other sawmills were operating up and down the Fox river. Oshkosh provided lumber for the railroads. When the Great Chicago Fire destroyed much of Chicago in 1871, Oshkosh sawmills provided much of the lumber used to rebuild the city.
By 1870, Oshkosh had become the third-largest city in Wisconsin. It had a population of over 12,000. The "Oshkosh Daily Northwestern" newspaper (now the Oshkosh Northwestern) was founded around this time. Oshkosh State Normal School later became the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh).
Oshkosh B’Gosh, a clothing manufacturer, started here in 1903. They started out making adult work clothing. But they became famous making children's clothing. Their bib overalls allowed children to dress just like their working fathers. In 2005 the company was purchased by Carter's, Inc., a children's clothing company. Oshkosh B'Gosh is still sold as a separate brand of clothing. The clothing is no longer made in Oshkosh but the corporate headquarters are still there.
The Experimental Aircraft Association, headquartered in Oshkosh, holds a yearly air show called "AirVenture Oshkosh". It is mainly for experimental and recreational aircraft. The event has been held at Oshkosh since 1970. The large number of planes coming and going during the fly-in week makes the Wittman Field air traffic control tower the busiest in the world. The event has become so popular that fans simply call it "Oshkosh".

The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) was founded in 1804 in London, England. It was originally called the Horticultural Society of London, and was renamed in 1861. The RHS is the UK's leading gardening charity.
The RHS helps to protect plants, gardens and parks. It also helps people learn gardening, and encourages people to grow their own food.
It holds flower shows such as the RHS Chelsea Flower Show, Hampton Court Palace Flower Show, RHS Tatton Park Flower Show and RHS Cardiff Flower Show.
The RHS has several gardens. The four main gardens are: Wisley Garden in Surrey, Rosemoor Garden in Devon, Hyde Hall in Essex, and Harlow Carr in North Yorkshire.
The society honours certain people with the Victoria Medal of Honour, and the Banksian, Knightian and Lindley medals. It awards Gold, Silver-gilt, Silver, and Bronze medals to exhibitors at its flower shows. The Veitch Memorial Medal is awarded each year for an outstanding contribution to the science and practice of horticulture.
Other awards bestowed by the society include the "Associate of Honour" and the "Honorary Fellowship".
The Award of Garden Merit, or AGM, is for garden plants that have been extensively tested by the society, and are recommended.
The RHS works to help keep collections of cultivated plants. Some of these collections are kept by the RHS, and others are kept by other people who send documents and dried plant samples to the RHS. 
The Lindley Library of the RHS has five branches. The library began as the book collection of John Lindley.
The RHS Herbarium has many dried plant specimens. It also has its own image library with more than 3,300 original watercolours, approximately 30,000 colour slides and many digital images.
The society has published a magazine since 1866. Since 1975 it has had the title "The Garden" and is currently published monthly. The RHS publishes "The Plantsman" and "The Orchid Review" four times a year. "Hanburyana" is published once a year. It is about horticultural taxonomy.
Since the International Registration Authorities for plants were formed in 1955, the RHS has been the official "Registrar" for some groups of cultivated plants. It is now Registrar for nine categories – conifers, clematis, daffodils, dahlias, delphiniums, dianthus, lilies, orchids and rhododendrons. It publishes The International Orchid Register, the central list of orchid hybrids.

Aegean cat

The Aegean cat () is a breed of cat. It first lived on the Cyclades islands on the Aegean Sea. This is how it got its name. Because it was an island cat, it likes to play in water and to catch fish.
The Aegean now lives all over Greece and is a common domestic cat that lives in homes. But there are also many that are feral in Greece. This means they are not tame and they run wild. They hang around fishing ports begging for food. This breed is probably the only cat that began in Greece.
Aegean cat fur is medium long. It gives good protection during bad winter weather. They have two or three colors. One of the colors is always white, with no yellow tone. Other colors can be black, red, blue, and cream. The fur may or may not have tabby stripes. These cats are strong with muscles and are medium-sized. The paws are medium in size and have a round shape. The eyes are always green and they have an almond shape.
The Aegean cat has been tame for hundreds of years and has been living where people are. So it is a friendly and intelligent pet that likes attention. The Aegean can not only live in an apartment, but is also a good rodent catcher outside.

The Road to Serfdom

The Road to Serfdom is a book written by the Austrian-born economist and philosopher Friedrich von Hayek (1899–1992) between 1940–1943.
In the book he warned of the danger of tyranny which comes from "government control of economic decision-making by central planning". He means the way fascist, communist and socialist governments try to control every aspect of the economy. 
The rights and wishes of the individual are important, and the state should not interfere too much. When the state controls too much, that leads to a loss of freedom, an oppressive society, and eventually the tyranny of a dictator. The individual citizen becomes a serf. Hayek argued that fascism and socialism had roots in central economic planning and giving the state power over the individual.
After its publication in 1944, "The Road to Serfdom" became a popular account of market libertarianism. It has sold over two million copies.
"The Road to Serfdom" was to be a popular edition of the second volume of Hayek’s "The Abuse and Decline of Reason". The title was inspired by the writings of the 19th century French classical liberal Alexis de Tocqueville on the "road to servitude". The book was first published in Britain by Routledge in March 1944, during World War II, and was quite popular. Hayek called it "that unobtainable book", due to wartime paper rationing. 
It was published in the United States by the University of Chicago Press in September 1944 and became popular. The American magazine "Reader's Digest" published an abridged version in April 1945. This got "The Road to Serfdom" to a wider group of readers than before. The book had a big impact on twentieth-century conservative and libertarian economic and political thinking. It is often cited today by commentators.

Australian Mists are medium-sized short-haired cats. They have large eyes and a short coat of fur. They do not need much brushing because they do not lose much hair. Their coat has three types of markings. First is their background solid color. It is paler than their pattern, which is spotted like a tabby. Their legs and tail have rings or stripes. Their face and neck also have lines of color. The accepted colors are blue, chocolate, lilac, cinnamon and fawn.
Australian Mists are okay with being picked up and held. They do not scratch much. When they are kittens, they have a lot of energy. As adults, they settle down to be quiet cats. They make good indoor cats. Some can be trained to go for walks with a collar and a leash.

Northern pike

The Northern pike ("Esox lucius"), has a number of nicknames such as 'Northern', 'Great northern pike', 'Pike', and 'Jack'. It's name literally means 'water wolf'. The Northern pike is a freshwater game fish and the second largest member of the Esox (Pike) family. It is also that family's namesake. In North America they are native to Alaska, Canada and the Upper Midwestern United States. Their natural range also includes Northern Europe and Asia. They are a cold water fish and do best in deep lakes. Northerns are voracious feeders that require large supplies of fish for steady growth. If they are overpopulated in a body of water their growth rate is often stunted.
Northern pike and Muskellunge look very similar and are sometimes confused. The Northern has light colored markings on a dark body (the opposite of the Musky). Also the Northern has a rounded tail fins while the Musky's are pointed. The northern has a long body. It has a large number of very sharp teeth. The northern is the only member of the pike family with spots on its side that are lighter than the body color. Another difference is they have five or less pores under the jaw; muskies have six or more.
Northern pike are frequently found in very shallow water. They prefer weeds and are often found near fallen logs. In the early spring Northerns move to very shallow water. They often spawn in weedy marshes. As the weather warms up, Northerns move to deeper water close to the edges of weed beds. 
Northerns eat other fish; they eat a lot of other fish. They control other fish species from becoming overpopulated. They feed on whatever is easiest to catch. They wait in ambush and can rush forward with tremendous speed.

Mount Washington (New Hampshire)

Mount Washington is the tallest mountain in New Hampshire. It is also the tallest in the northeastern United States. It is tall. The mountain is known for cold and stormy weather. Some people think it has the "worst weather in the world". The highest wind speed ever measured on earth, 231 miles per hour, was recorded there.
The Native American name for the mountain was Agiocochook (or Agiochook). It was thought to be the home of the Great Spirit. As early as 1628 it appears in print as "Christall hill" (Crystal Hill). In July 1874 it was given its current name, Mt. Washington, after George Washington. A road to the summit was completed in 1859. It allowed horses and carriages to travel to the top. The road is still there today. 
On 31 August 1899, Freelan O. Stanley and his wife drove a Stanley Steamer motor car to the top of Mt. Washington. Not counting stops to add water, the car took two hours and ten minutes to reach the top.
In 1869 a cog railroad was built to carry tourists to the top of the mountain. It carried so many passengers at a time a new hotel had to be built in 1873. Sylvester Marsh designed this system and in 1866 he raised funds to build the first cog railroad; it was to the top of Mt. Washington. He was called "Crazy Marsh" because a railroad going up a mountain was thought to be impossible. But Marsh wasn't crazy. He took out patents on his design. Customers paid to ride to the top even before it was finished. They called the ride "Jacob’s Ladder". It is still in operation today climbing the mountain at 2.8 miles per hour.

Handkerchief

A handkerchief , also called a handkercher or hanky, is a form of a kerchief, usually made of thin fabric that can be carried in the pocket or purse. It was invented for personal hygiene purposes such as wiping one's hands or face, or blowing one's nose. 
A handkerchief is also sometimes used as a purely decorative accessory in a suit pocket.
The material of a handkerchief can be symbolic of the social-economic class of the user. It is not only because some materials are more expensive, but because some materials are more absorbent and useful for those who use a handkerchief for more than style. Handkerchiefs can be made of cotton, cotton-synthetic blend, synthetic fabric, silk, or linen.
Before people used the word handkerchief, the word kerchief alone was common. This term came from two French words: couvrir, which means “to cover,” and chef, which means “head.”
In the time of ancient Greece and Rome, handkerchiefs were often used the way they are today. But in the Middle Ages, kerchiefs were usually used to cover the head.

Legibility

Legibility is the degree to which the print can be seen and read. Each glyph (individual character) in text has a shape we recognise in reading. The complete set of letters and symbols in a design is called a font (or fount). The choice of font is therefore the first thing which affects legibility.
A second factor in legibility is the setting, the way the type is used in practice. This includes line length, line spacing ("leading"), justification, typestyle, kerning, tracking, point size, etc.

Cairn Terrier

The Cairn Terrier is a breed of working dogs. It is one of the oldest terrier dog breeds. It is a small terrier from the Scottish Highlands. The breed was used for hunting among the cairns (a cairn is a pile of stones in the Scottish Highlands).
Cairn Terriers have rough hair or fur that helps to protect the dog from water and dirt.
The fur can be blue, red, sandy, gray, or brindle. Pure black, and white are usually not permitted by breeding groups.
The Cairn Terrier's hair should not be cut with scissors. The old hair is removed by pulling it by hand. This is called hand-stripping. Removing the dead hair like this will let new hair grow.

Boleskine House

Boleskine House is a house on the south side of Loch Ness. It is in the Scottish Highlands. It is best known for having been the home of two famous people. First was the writer and occultist Aleister Crowley. Then later, it was the home of Jimmy Page, the guitarist for Led Zeppelin.
The house was mostly burned down by fire in December 2015. Boleskine House is a Category B listed building in the United Kingdom, along with the stables and a small lodge (cottage). This means it has historical and cultural importance.
Boleskine House is 21 miles south of Inverness and close to the village of Foyers. The house was built in the 18th century as a hunting cottage or lodge. The house is right next to a graveyard. The graveyard was already thought to have ghosts and supernatural happenings, even before Crowley bought it.
Crowley bought Boleskine House from the Archibald Fraser family in 1899. There were rumors of him using black magic and rituals while he lived at the house. His housekeeper had bad things happen while living there, including the death of his two children. Crowley later said that he had used too much black magic. He sold the house in 1913, because he was running out of money.
Page was already collecting things about Aleister Crowley. He was reading about him and was interested in his ideas. He bought the house and land in 1970. He thought it would be a good spooky place to help him write songs. At the time it was in bad shape and needed repairs. But, even though he had the house fixed up; he did not spend much time there. Page sold the house in 1992. He actually lived there for less than six weeks.
A fantasy scene for Page that was shown in Led Zeppelin's movie "The Song Remains the Same" was made around Boleskin House. It was made during a full moon in December, 1973. Page is climbing a mountain in the moonlight.
After Page sold it, the house was run as a guest-house. In 2009, the house and land were put up for sale. The sale also included 140 feet of shoreline of Loch Ness. The new Dutch owners, who are not known, were using it as a holiday home.
On the afternoon of 23 December 2015, a motorist passing by saw flames and smoke coming from Boleskine House. By the time fire crews arrived, almost 60 percent of the home was already burned. Flames were rising up to 20 feet high. The firefighters tried to save the west wing of the house, as the rest of the building had been too badly damaged. The fire was thought to have started in the kitchen, but no one was home.
It is not known how much of Boleskine House is still standing since the fire. A former owner said that the damage is so bad it "is unlikely it will ever be rebuilt unless there is someone out there with an interest in the occult wanting to spend a lot of money."

Komondor

The Komondor is a breed of dog. 
The Komondors are cord-coated dogs. They come from Hungary. They are livestock guard dogs and should not be confused with herd dogs. They stay with the animals they guard as a member of their flock. Komondors need a job to do or a property to guard. 
They should not be kept in apartments. They need space, a large garden or a home in the countryside. They are not lap dogs but working dogs. They may think of their family as their herd to take care of. The Komondors are and must be at least high. But they can be much bigger; this is the minimum height. They live 12-14 years; that is long life for a big dog. 
Komondors are calm, intelligent and independent. They do not always need a human to tell them what to do. This trait can make them more difficult to train. They are loyal and will often follow family members around the house. A Komondor is a large dog. To protect a herd or family is instinctive to this breed. Komondors can be aggressive with people they meet, if they do not learn how to be friendly and social with people and other pets. This ability to be friendly must be taught while they are puppies. Komondors are generally quiet dogs. They do not bark without a good reason. Giving a glaring stare can be a warning to intruders to leave, or the Komondor will attack. 
Komondor dogs should be trained to listen to owners and caregivers. Otherwise they will just go on doing things their own way. This is because that is what they learned to do for hundreds of years. The Komondors were often left alone to take care of the herd. The Komondors learned to make decisions and not wait for directions to tell them what to do if a wolf or bear was coming.
The Komondor is usually silent and sleeping during the day. But when the night comes the Komondor starts moving around. The Komondor will walk up and down all over the area he is supposed to guard. The dog will take care of any thief, burglar or bad people who want to make trouble. The Komondor often knows how to tell a friendly person from a burglar. The Komondor just knows and feels if somebody will come with a bad intention.

Cyprus cat

The Cyprus cat is a breed of cat. These cats are thought to have first come from ancient Egypt or Palestine. They were brought to the island of Cyprus by St. Helen. These are now common domestic cats that live in homes or outside. Many of these cats still live all over Cyprus. But, a large number are now feral. This means they are not tame and they run wild. 
A researcher, J.-D. Vigne and his group, might have discovered the oldest domestic cat, in Cyprus. In 2004, archaeologists working at a Neolithic site in southern Cyprus dug up carefully buried bones of a cat. It had been placed next to human bones and artifacts. "Examination showed that a small pit or grave had been deliberately dug out, and the body of the cat was placed in it, then rapidly covered." The cat skeleton is about 4,000 years older than any known Egyptian drawings or writings.
Cyprus cats were probably living in a Byzantine monastery in the fourth century. In legends, it is said that St. Helen brought hundreds of cats to get rid of poisonous snakes that were taking over the monastery. The monastery had two bells. One rang to call the cats for their food. The second one rang to send the cats out to the meadows to hunt snakes. Now, the monastery has very few cats that live there.
Cyprus cats are strong, athletic and full of energy. They live both in the cool mountains and in hotter areas near the sea coasts. They can adapt to any climate or living space.

American Curl

The American Curl is a breed of cat. It has unusual ears for a cat. They curl back away from the face and seem to be sideways. This cat is a rare breed, but now lives in the United States, Spain, France, Japan, Russia, and other parts of the world. The American Curl is usually a strong and healthy breed.
Both longhaired and shorthaired American Curls have soft, silky coats which lie flat against their bodies. They require little grooming and enjoy spending time with their owners.
The American Curl is a medium-sized cat (5–10 lbs). It is not completely grown until 2–3 years of age. American Curl kittens are born with straight ears, like any other kittens. The ears begin to curl in about eighty-two days. After four months, their ears will not curl any longer. Then they become hard and feel stiff.
A house pet American Curl may have almost straight ears. To qualify for cat shows, ears must curl at an angle between 90 and 180 degrees. More curl is better, but cats will be not allowed to be shown if their ears touch the back of their skulls.
The breed began in Lakewood, California in a natural birth of kittens, but with a genetic mutation. In June 1981, two stray kittens were found and taken in by the Ruga family. The kittens were both longhaired, one black and the other black and white. The family named the black cat Shulamith. The black and white was named Panda. Several weeks later, Panda went missing. This left Shulamith to be the first female of the American Curl breed.
In 1986, an American Curl was judged in a cat show for the first time. In 1992, a longhaired American Curl became a champion in The International Cat Association (TICA). In 1999, the American Curl was the first breed the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) Championship Class allowed in both longhair and shorthair categories.
American Curl cats' ears need cleaning often to keep away infections. The ears must also be handled very gently to keep from breaking the cartilage.

Mercator projection

The Mercator projection is a cylindrical map projection which is widely used in cartography today. It was developed by Gerardus Mercator in 1569. It is not a physical projection, and cannot be constructed using geometric tools. On a small scale, geometric shapes can be moved around the map, without distorting them (this property is known as conformity). As a downside, the scale of the shape and the direction of lines may change when shapes are moved. For example, Africa is actually 15 times larger than Greenland, but on this map projection they look the same size.
Today, Mercator projections are mainly used for maps.

Scagliola (from the Italian "scaglia", meaning "chips"), is an artificial way of imitating marble and other precious material. It is a decorative building material. 
Stucco columns, sculptures, and other architectural elements can be made by scagliola. It came into fashion in 17th-century Tuscany.
Scagliola is a composite substance made from selenite, glue and natural pigments, imitating marble and other hard stones. The material may be veined with colours and stuck on to a core, or patterns may be carved into a prepared scagliola matrix. The pattern is then then filled with the coloured, plaster-like composite. Then it is polished with flax oil for brightness, and wax for protection. The whole thing gives a richness of colour not easy to get in natural marbles.

Puli

The Puli is a small to medium sized dog breed. It was brought to Hungary with the Magyars in the late 9th century. They are used as herding and guard dogs. 
Female Pulis are about high. Males are . Females weigh . Males weigh a little more.
The Puli is an intelligent and active dog. It needs obedience training while still young. If a Puli gets enough exercise it can live in the city, even in an apartment. 
But Pulis do best when not kept as indoor pets in a small living space. Pulis kept indoors need a lot of exercise to use up their energy, or they can became either shy or overactive. They need to get the kind of exercise they were created for. A Puli without enough exercise can became mischievous and cause trouble. The right kind of exercise includes running, biking, hiking, jogging and field work; not just a walk around the corner. Pulis are best kept in a house with a garden.
The Puli is happiest when it has work to do. Then this dog will show excellent intelligence, strength and ability to work with humans. This satisfies their strong instinct to guard their herd.
As a working dog, the Puli is obedient and focused when doing a task. Some of them are used as police dogs. They are one of the best sheepdogs. Pulis don't need to be taught how to guard the sheep. They naturally protect their territory and flock. Even though they are not big dogs, they will still try to scare away anyone they do not know. 
If well trained, they understand even the smallest instructions and obey. They are excellent in obedience trials for dogs. These are also dogs who are sensitive (get their feelings hurt easily). Pulis hate being bullied or made fun of. Because they are so intelligent, they understand that they are being mistreated. If not treated well, they lose their desire to cooperate.
Pulis are not very friendly with people they do not know. With owners and friends, these dogs are funny, lovely and playful. Pulis bark quite a lot.
The coat of fur on a Puli is corded, like dreadlocks. The puli is a one-colored dog. It is usually black. It can also be white, gray, or cream. All Pulis, even the white ones have black eyes, black noses and black feet. The Puli's coat needs a lot of care to keep its cords clean, neat, and attractive. About 45 minutes of grooming work each week is recommended. When the dog is older the cords can become quite long and heavy. They sometimes are so long that they touch the ground. The cords can be thinner or thicker cords. The thin, nice cords are made by keeping the fur clean and cared for. Thin ropes are made by hand forming thinner ropes. 
This breed has little to no shedding (see Moult).

American Cocker Spaniel

The American Cocker Spaniel is a breed of dog. It is one of many Spaniel breeds. In the United States, the breed is usually called the Cocker Spaniel. In other parts of the world, it is called the American Cocker Spaniel. This is because there is a Cocker Spaniel called English Cocker Spaniel. They are clever, loving and happy dogs.
The breed is the smallest of the sporting or hunting dogs. Also, there are some differences between it and its English relative. It is a happy and intelligent working breed. Because of having been bred to meet show dog qualities, it is no longer an ideal working dog. These Spaniels now have many health problems with their hearts, eyes and ears. 
The American Cocker has a medium long silky coat of fur. It has an upturned nose, either black or brown. It has long, silky ears that hang down. The eyes are large, dark in color and round. Fur colors can be black, tan, cream, dark red, buff, roan and sometimes merle. 
This dog breed is nicknamed the "Merry Cocker". It is a friendly dog and not shy.
It is smart as a hunting dog. IQ tests given in the 1950s and 1960s showed the American Cocker did best of all dogs tested on hunting skills. But, they did not do as well on other skills. These showed they were slower in uncovering a dish of food or pulling on a string. The American Cocker Spaniel is in 20th place in Stanley Coren's "The Intelligence of Dogs". This means this dog is excellent in "Working or Obedience Intelligence" and in being trained. 
If they are played with and loved as puppies, American Cockers can get along with people, children, other dogs and other pets. This breed has a tail that wags most of the time. It likes best to be around people. It is not meant to be left alone in a backyard. Cockers can get stressed by loud noises and by being treated roughly or fussed at.
Because they have now been bred to have a long coat, they can no longer be active enough to hunt or be exercised outside.

Knock Shrine () is a Roman Catholic pilgrimage site. In 1879, a religious vision was said to have happened in the village of Knock, County Mayo, Ireland. It was seen by fifteen people. The vision was of The Virgin Mary, Saint Joseph, John the Evangelist, angels, and Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God. A church was later built on the site, to worship and remember this event.
On the evening of 21 August 1879, at about 8 o'clock, fifteen people, aged from five years to seventy-five included men, women, teenagers and children, witnessed this event. 
They all said they saw an apparition of Our Lady, Saint Joseph, and Saint John the Evangelist on the wall of the small parish church. The little church was caled the Church of Saint John the Baptist. 
The Blessed Virgin Mary was said to be beautiful, standing a few feet above the ground. She wore a white dress. She had a crown on her head. The crown was golden, sparkling, and glittering. She was described as "in prayer", with her eyes raised to heaven. 
Saint Joseph, also wearing a white robe, stood on the Virgin's right hand. Behind the figures, to the left of Saint John was a plain altar. On the altar was a cross and a lamb, with angels around. The lamb is the symbol of Jesus. This symbol is from the religious phrase The Lamb of God) 
Those who saw the apparition stood in the rain for up to two hours.
An ecclesiastical inquiry was held to decide if the vision was true and not a mistake or fake.
The evidence was found to be trustworthy and not a lie. At a second Commission of inquiry in 1936, the surviving witnesses confirmed the evidence they gave to the first Commission.
Every August, ten thousand pilgrims go to visit the Knock Shrine .
The original little church is still there. A new Apparition chapel with statues of Our Lady, St Joseph, the lamb and St John the Evangelist, has been built next to it. Knock Basilica is a separate building showing a tapestry of the apparition.

Prime number theorem

The Prime number theorem is a theorem from number theory. Prime numbers are not distributed evenly across the number range. The theorem formalizes the idea that the probability of hitting a prime number between 1 and a given number becomes smaller, as numbers grow. This probability is about n/ln(n), where ln(n) is the natural logarithm function. This means that the probability of hitting a prime number with 2n digits is about half as likely than with n digits. For example, among the positive integers of at most 1000 digits, about one in 2300 is prime (ln 10 ≈ 2302.6), whereas among positive integers of at most 2000 digits, about one in 4600 is prime (ln 10 ≈ 4605.2). In other words, the average gap between consecutive prime numbers among the first "N" integers is roughly ln("N").
Fifteen-year old Carl Friedrich Gauß suspected that there was a link between prime numbers and logarithms in 1793. Adrien-Marie Legendre also suspected such a link in 1798. Jacques Hadamard and Charles-Jean de La Vallée Poussin proved the prime number theorem, in 1896, over a century after Gauß.

<doc id="460590" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=460590" title="Cat righting reflex">
Cat righting reflex

The cat righting reflex is a cat's natural ability to turn itself around as it falls so it will land on its feet. This righting reflex starts to happen at 3–4 weeks of age. The cat has entirely learned how to do this by 6–7 weeks. Cats are able to do this because they have a flexible backbone and a clavicle that does not move. The minimum height needed for this to happen safely in most cats is about 12 inches.
Cats without a tail can also do this. This is because a cat mostly moves its hind legs and does not use much angular momentum to set itself up for landing. So a tail is not really needed for this skill.
Using this righting reflex, cats can often land without injury. But, this is not always true, since cats can still break bones or die from extreme falls. 
In a 1987 study, written in the "Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association", 132 cats were looked at after having fallen from buildings. The injuries per cat were more, depending on the height fallen; up to seven stories high. Above seven stories, the injuries were less. The study authors think that after falling five stories, the cats reached terminal velocity. At that time, the cats relaxed and spread their bodies to increase drag.
First, cats decide which is up or down, by looking to see or by using senses in the inner ear. Then, cats manage to twist themselves to face downward, without ever changing their angular momentum. They do this in these steps:
If the cat is not flexible enough (able to bend easily), it may need to do steps two and three again in order to completely right itself.
Besides this righting reflex, cats have body features that help keep them safe in a fall. Their small size, light bones, and thick fur decrease their terminal velocity. Also, once righted they may also spread out their body to increase drag and slow how fast they are falling. They also relax as they fall, which protects them some when they land.

Buttered cat paradox

The buttered cat paradox is a popular joke based on putting two adages (sayings) together to make them funny:
The paradox happens when one asks this question: What would happen if one attached a piece of buttered toast (butter side up) to the back of a cat, then dropped the cat from a large height? 
In reality, cats can turn themselves right side up in mid-air if they should fall upside-down. This is named the cat righting reflex. This reflex lets them land on their feet if dropped from high enough up (about ). Toast, not being alive, does not have the ability to turn itself over. Nor does it want to, since it cannot think.
Toast usually lands on the floor butter-side-down. This is because of how it is dropped from a table. As the toast falls from the table, it rotates or turns. Using the average speed of rotation for a slice of toast as it falls from the table and the usual height of a table, a slice of toast that began butter-side-up on the table will land butter-side-down on the floor 81% of the time. This is because the buttered side is heavier. When an object has a heavy and light side, in most cases it will fall heavy side first.
Domestic cats usually weigh between . A regular slice of bread weighs only one ounce and a pat of butter about one fourth ounce. So attaching a very small piece of toast with butter to a much larger cat would hardly have any effect on how the cat would move.

Louis Philippe I

Louis Philippe I (6 October 1773 – 26 August 1850) was the first and only person to have the title King of the French. Following the execution of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, France became a republic. He spent 21 years in exile before being made king after the death of Charles X of France in 1830. His relatively short reign (1830–1848) was known as the July Monarchy. Louis-Philippe promoted friendship with Great Britain. He sponsored colonialism, notably the conquest of Algeria. His popularity faded quickly when French troops fired on demonstrators. This set off the French Revolution of 1848 causing Louis Philippe to flee England as "Mr. Smith". He lived out his life in exile in England. His eldest son and heir died before succeeding him. This brought the Kingdom of the French to an end.
Born at the Palais Royal in Paris he was named Louis Philippe d'Orléans, Louis Philippe in honour of his father. His parents were the Duke and Duchess of Orléans. One of the most senior members of the French royal court. He was born a Prince of the blood which entitled him to be addressed as "His Serene Highness". From birth he was given the title of Duke of Valois one of his fathers subsidiary titles. He was the eldest of four children born to the duke and duchess. He was a member of the House of Orléans, itself a cadet branch of the ruling House of Bourbon. The two branches were both directly descended from Louis XIV and were often in competition with one another. 
His education was carried out by Madame de Genlis who was later his fathers mistress. It was her that instilled a fairly liberal attitude within the young prince. When Louis Philippe's grandfather died in 1785, his father succeeded him as Duke of Orléans and Louis Philippe succeeded his father as Duke of Chartres.
His parents had a strained marriage the Duke was famous for his many extramarital affairs and his wife just quietly accepted his infidelity. She was a notoriously religious woman who relished watching her children grow up. Louis Philippe was the eldest of four children born to the couple. Louis Philippe was very close to his brother, the younger Duke of Montpensier. 
In 1792 he joined the French army and went to fight in Austria. But in April 1793 he deserted. He could not return to France so he found work as a teacher in Switzerland. He then went to live in Sweden. After that he lived in the United States and finally he moved to England.
After the abdication of Napoleon in 1814, Louis Philippe returned to France. King Louis XVIII gave him back his Orléans estates.
In 1808, proposed to Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King George III of the United Kingdom. His Catholicism and the opposition of her mother Queen Charlotte meant the princess reluctantly declined the offer.
In 1809, Louis Philippe married Princess Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily, daughter of King Ferdinand IV of Naples and Maria Carolina of Austria. They had ten children. Maria Amalia was also a niece of the late Queen Marie Antoinette.
He died on August 26, 1850 in Claremont, Surrey, England.
When king of the French he made his children and descendants legally able to bare the title of Prince/ss of Orléans. With the style of "Royal Highness".

<doc id="460622" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=460622" title="Stanley Motor Carriage Company">
Stanley Motor Carriage Company

The Stanley Motor Carriage Company was an American manufacturer of steam-engine cars. The company was founded in 1898 and incorporated in 1901. The cars made by the company were called Stanley Steamers. They were produced from 1896 to 1924. In the early 1900s steam was used to power locomotives, steamships, even sewing machines. It seemed natural that steam could power cars. Of all the steam driven cars made in the early 20th century, the Stanley Steamer was the best-known and most popular. Today Stanley Steamers are rare automobiles and hard to find outside of museums and a few car collections.
Twins Francis E. Stanley and Freelan O. Stanley were the co-inventors of the Stanley Steamer automobile. Freelan was a teacher and high school principal. Francis was also a teacher, but left teaching in 1874 to become a photographer. In 1885 they both left their jobs and started a company to make photographic plates for photographers. they sold their shop four years later when they moved to Watertown, Massachusetts. They started another photographic plate business, but sold it to Eastman Kodak in 1904. The brothers had become interested in making cars and wanted to do that full time.
Many inventors were working on making cars during this time. The Stanley brothers built their first two cars as a hobby. In 1898 they brought their cars to the first Auto show in the US held in Boston. Cars from the US and Europe were on exhibition. There was also an outdoor competition. Their Stanley Steamers were faster and could climb hills much better than other cars. No gasoline engined car could climb the 15% grade. A Whitney steam car nearly climbed the 20% grade. The Stanley steamer easily climbed the 30% grade.
With the money from the sale of their company to Eastman Kodak, they began making steam cars. In 1899, they produced and sold over 200 cars, more than any other U.S. maker. In 1899, Freelan and his wife Flora drove one of these cars to the top of Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the highest peak in the northeastern United States. The ascent took more than two hours and was notable as being the first time a car had climbed the long Mount Washington Carriage Road; the descent was accomplished by putting the engine in low gear and using the car's brakes. The twins later sold the rights to this early design to Locomobile, and in 1902 they formed the Stanley Motor Carriage Company.
Stanley licensed their designs to several other motor car companies. The White Motor Company was one who used the Stanley design and continued to produce steam cars until 1912. Stanley was the last manufacturer of steam powered cars. As the internal combustion engine designs improved, steam and electric cars lost much of their popularity. The numbers of cars sold went down to less than 600 a year in 1918. That year the Stanley brothers sold the company to Prescott Warren, a Chicago businessman. Francis Stanley died in an automobile accident later the same year (1918). His brother Freelan opened a hotel in Colorado called The Stanley Hotel. He lived to be 91 years old. Stanley Steamers were made until 1924.
Early Stanley cars had bodies made of wood. The bodies were attached to steel frames by leaf springs. Later bodies were made of aluminum. A Kerosene burner heated a drum-shaped boiler. The boiler stored steam. The driver controlled the steam going to the engine by a throttle. There was no need for a transmission. Starting a Stanley in the morning would wake everyone who lived nearby. It sounded like a steam locomotive, hissing and chugging. It was very hard to steal a Stanley Steamer. It took 20 minutes to gather enough steam before it could move. Once it was moving it seemed to have unlimited power. An early Stanley Steamer was capable of 75 miles per hour. In 1906 a Stanley Steamer broke the land speed record at 127 miles per hour in Florida. To operate a Stanley Steamer, the driver had to watch a number of gauges. There were 13 handles, pumps and valves to adjust. They carried only a small amount of water due to its weight. The car could only go about 40 miles before it had to add water. The kerosene burner was known to cause fires. The easier to operate gasoline powered internal combustion engine caused the steam car to become obsolete.

<doc id="460688" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=460688" title="Voice-tracking">
Voice-tracking

Voice-tracking is a technique used by some radio stations in radio broadcasting to make an illusion of a live disc jockey or announcer sitting in the studios of the radio station when one is actually not in the station.
Voice-tracking refers to the process of a disc jockey prerecording the parts when they speak on the radio. It is then mixed with songs, commercials and other elements to make it sound like a live air shift. Voice-tracking is mostly used in radio stations, especially during the night, overnight, weekend, and holiday time periods. Most radio stations also use it as a way to save money instead of having disc jockeys around the clock.
Sometimes, voice-tracking is done so that people can do other jobs. For example, a DJ may also have a job as a program director or general manager. Voice-tracking allows that person to record a three-hour shift in less than a half-hour, leaving him or her time to do office work. A popular live weekday morning radio host can record parts for a Saturday show, allowing him or her to be on the air six days a week without spending more time at the station. It is also helpful during holidays such as Christmas or Easter, when people are off spending time with their families.
Different radio stations want their DJs to speak only at certain times. Here is an example:
As an example, see the picture below:<br>
As one song ends, the next song begins. At this point, the DJ doesn't start talking until the second song starts and he stops at the point where the song's vocals start.

Black box

A black box, in science and engineering, is a box whose inside working is not known.
It is a device, system or object with input and output. There is no knowledge of its internal workings. The way it works is "opaque" (black). Almost anything might be referred to as a black box: a transistor, an algorithm, or the human brain.
Ashby expains that the term arose when a decision had to be made about opening an engineering box. The question was whether to return the box for repair, or just scrap it. Could this be decided without opening the box? There can be many reasons why a complex system cannot be repaired in the field, and even opening up some systems is a big deal. The question also comes up in surgery on brain damage patients. The more that can be discovered before operating, the better.
The opposite of a black box is a system where the inner components or logic can be seen. It is sometimes known as a clear box, a glass box, or a white box

Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans

Prince Ferdinand Philippe of Orléans, Duke of Orléans (Ferdinand Philippe Louis Charles Henri Joseph; 3 September 1810 – 13 July 1842) was the eldest son of Louis Philippe d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans and future King Louis Philippe I. Born in exile in his mother's native Sicily, he was their heir to the House of Orléans from birth. Following his father's succession as King of the French in 1830, he became the "Prince Royal" and subsequently Duke of Orléans (French: "duc d'Orléans"), the title by which he is best known. Dying in 1842, he never succeeded his father nor saw the collapse of the "July Monarchy" and subsequent exile of his family to England.
He was named after his two grandfathers King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Philippe Égalité. He was born in Palermo and given the title of Duke of Chartres. He was also a prince of the blood at the French royal court of Versailles. This gave him the style of "Serene Highness". His father was banned from attending court at Versailles due to his liberal views. Prince did not attend either. He instead remained at his father's court at their Parisian residence the Palais Royal. 
His father became King of the French in 1830. This made the prince the heir to the title of Duke of Orléans and heir to the throne. From that time the heir to the French throne was to be known as the Duke of Orléans. His father also declared his descendants through the male line were entitled to use the style of "Royal Highness". They also used the title (a title in its own right) of Prince of Orléans. The prince became known as His Royal Highness, Prince Ferdinand Philippe of Orléans, Duke of Orléans. His sons were also entitled to the same style and title.
There were plans for him to marry his cousin, Princess Louise Marie Thérèse d'Artois. But the plans never materialised. There were also negotiations for the young prince to marry an Austrian Archduchess as well as a Russian grand duchess. But the plans again never materialised as the new monarchy in France was seen as fragile and not expected to survive. Instead the choice came in the form of Duchess Helene of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. She was a member of a minor ducal family native to Germany. The couple eventually married on 30 May 1837. This gave her the style of Royal Highness and made her one of the first princesses of Orléans by marriage. The couple eventually had two sons and had a very happy marriage.

Interdisciplinarity

Interdisciplinarity is when two or more subjects (academic disciplines) join up. This happens when a problem overlaps traditional academic boundaries. Other terms which mean almost the same thing are multidisciplinarity and crossdisciplinarity.
An examples makes clear what is meant:
Other examples include artificial intelligence, cultural studies, cybernetics, computational linguistics, biomedical engineering, and so on. Physical chemistry, biochemistry and astrophysics must have been some of the first.
In many universities, traditional departments (e.g. botany, zoology) were scrapped, and new broader departments like 'School of biological sciences' were formed. Inside this umbrella, research and teaching teams were based on interdisciplinary problems, such as ecology or cell division or Earth history. There are some necessary specialities which do not fit easily into the new system. Examples are taxonomy (you still need people to identify animals) and areas like parasitology and agricultural botany. 
A system which works in some universities is to appoint staff to the Schools (usually Humanities, Science. Social sciences and Technology) and let the staff join those groups which best fit their expertise.

Watertown is a city in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States. It is part of the greater Boston area. The population was 31,915 at the 2010 census. Watertown is one of fourteen Massachusetts municipalities that have been granted city forms of government but kept the name town.
The area of Watertown was inhabited for thousands of years before the arrival of settlers from England. The tribes of the Pequossette and the Nonantum, had settlements on what is now called the Charles River. The Pequossette built a fishing to trap herring. This was at the site of the current Watertown Dam. Every year the alewife and blueback herring swim upstream from their adult home in the sea. this is to spawn in the fresh water where they came from.
The first settlement of Watertown was at the Saltonstall Plantation in 1630. This was one of the earliest of the Massachusetts Bay settlements. It was begun by a group of settlers led by Richard Saltonstall and the Rev. George Phillips. It was officially incorporated that same year. The alternate spelling "Waterton" is seen in some early documents.
The first buildings were on land that is now in the city of Cambridge. It was known as Gerry's Landing. For its first quarter century Watertown ranked next to Boston in population and area. Since then its city limits have been greatly reduced.
The Stanley Brothers built the first of their steam-powered cars, called Stanley Steamers, in Watertown in 1897.

Battering ram

A battering ram is a siege engine used in the past. It was used to break open the stone walls of castles or splinter their wooden gates.
In its simplest form, a battering ram is just a large, heavy log carried by several people and banged against an obstacle. The ram damages the target if the big log hit the target again and again. Later rams were covered in the log with an arrow-proof, fire-resistant canopy mounted on wheels. Inside the canopy, the log was swung from chains or ropes.
Rams were great weapons of war against old fashioned wall-building materials such as stone and brick. These walls were weak in tension: they cracked when struck with sufficient force. With many blows, the cracks would grow steadily until a hole was created. Eventually, a breach would appear in the fabric of the wall. It would cause armed attackers to force their way through the gap.
The introduction in the later Middle Ages of siege cannons causes the end of battering rams and other traditional siege weapons. Much smaller, hand-held versions of battering rams are still used today, however, by law enforcement officers and military personnel to bash open locked doors.

Zugzwang

Zugzwang is a chess term. It means a situation where any move by a player will weaken the player's position. The fact that the player is compelled to move means that their position will become significantly weaker. 
For example...
1. ... Kd7 and White cannot win:
2. c6+ Kc7
3. Kc5 Kc8
4. Kd6 Kd8 (opposing the king)
5. c7+ Kc8
6. Kc6 is stalemate
But if it is White to play in the original position, he can win by zugzwang:
1. Kc6! and now Black must move his king, for example
1... Kd8
3. Kb7 and queens the pawn.
There are positions where either player to move will lose. 
On the following diagram, Whichever king moves, he loses his pawn and the opponent will win the game.
The concept of zugzwang was known in the old forms of chess, like shatranj. We know this because there are some Arabic chess problems which use the idea.
The term itself comes from the 19th century in a German chess magazine. Its first use in English was in the early 20th century.

Dean of the United States House of Representatives

The Dean of the United States House of Representatives is the representative that has been in office the longest. The current Dean is John Conyers, a Democrat from Michigan. He has served in the House since January 3, 1965. The Dean is a symbolic job whose only customary duty is to swear in a Speaker of the House when he or she is elected. The Dean comes forward on the House Floor to administer (give) the oath to the Speaker-elect. The new Speaker then administers the oath to the other members. The Dean does not preside over the election of the Speaker, unlike the Father of the House in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom and the Dean of the Canadian House of Commons.
Because of other privileges associated with seniority, the Dean is usually given some of the most desirable office space. The Dean is generally either chair or ranking minority member of an influential committee. Unlike the office of President pro tem, the Office of the House of Representatives is not an official position.
Years as Dean are followed by name, party, state, and start of service in Congress.
All the members of the First Congress had equal seniority (as defined for the purpose of this article). But Muhlenberg as the Speaker was the first member to be sworn in. Muhlenberg, Hartley and Thatcher were among the 13 members who attended the initial meeting of the House on March 4, 1789.
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries some state delegations to the House were often not elected until after the term had begun. To avoid confusion, this fact is ignored in the list below.

Francis Edgar Stanley

Francis Edgar Stanley (1849 – 1918), was an American inventor, photographer and manufacturer. He and his twin brother Freelan Oscar Stanley invented and manufactured the Stanley Steamer car. They were pioneers in the use of steam engines to power cars. 
Francis E. Stanley and his twin Freelan O. Stanley were born on 1 June 1849 in Kingsfield, Maine. Their parents were Solomon and Apphia (French) Stanley. Solomon Stanley was both a farmer and a teacher. He and his brother graduated from Farmington State Normal School in Farmington, Maine. The school is now the University of Maine at Farmington. Francis became a teacher, and taught at New Portland, Cape Elizabeth and Strong, Maine. In 1870 he met and married Augusta May Walker, another teacher. Together they had three children. In 1875 he left teaching and moved to Auburn, Maine. He became an artist and photographer opening a studio there. He began to do more portrait photography and opened two more studios in Lewiston and Bridgton, Maine. In the early 1880s he started experimenting with the new dry plate way of taking pictures.
In 1885 both brothers left their jobs and started a company to make photographic plates for photographers. they sold their shop four years later when they moved to Watertown, Massachusetts. They started another photographic plate business, but sold it to Eastman Kodak in 1904. The photographic plate business had made both brothers very wealthy.
In 1897 the two brothers began experimenting and making steam-powered cars. They were soon making about 200 cars a year. In 1899 they purchased a bicycle factory in Watertown and began building their cars. They then sold their car company to John B. Walker and Amzi L. Barber for $250,000 USD. With it they sold the rights to their car designs. The sale had a clause that the two Stanley brothers could not build and sell cars for two years. The Stanley brothers broke the clause and had to give their new design to the company Walker and Barber formed, the Locomobile Company of America. In 1901 Francis and Freelan Stanley formed a new car company, the Stanley Motor Carriage Company. 
The cars they produced, called Stanley Steamers, had many advantages. The cost was $ 650. That was $300 less than the cost of a Ford Model T. The cars were very quiet and only made hissing sounds from the boiler. They had no transmission because there was no need to change gears as there was with gasoline-powered cars. Their cars began making news. In 1899, Freelan and his wife Flora drove one of these cars to the top of Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the highest peak in the northeastern United States. The ascent took more than two hours and was notable as being the first time a car had climbed the long Mount Washington Carriage Road. In 1906 a Stanley Steamer broke the land speed record at 127 miles per hour on a beach in Florida.
As other car companies moved from steam to gasoline power, the Stanley Steamer became the most popular steam powered car. As the internal combustion engine designs improved, however, steam and electric cars lost much of their popularity. Finally, the numbers of cars sold went down to less than 600 a year in 1918. That year the Stanley brothers sold the company to Prescott Warren, a Chicago businessman. both brothers retired. A few months later, while he was driving home from a trip to Maine, his car ran off the road. He was driving a new 1918 Model 735 Stanley Steamer. He died in the accident, July 21, 1918. He was 69 years old. His brother Freelan lived to be 91 years old.

MIPS architecture

The MIPS architecture is an instruction set for computers that was developed at Stanford University in 1981. At the start, MIPS was an acronym for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages. Most of it is done in RISC. In a full RISC architecture, all commands have the same length. This simplifies the design of the microchip and allows to use fast clock cycles. At the start, the architecture used a 32 bit bus, but from 1991, a 64 bit architecture was used.
In 2015, MIPS implementations are primarily used in embedded systems such as Windows CE devices, routers, residential gateways, and video game consoles such as the Sony Playstation, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. Until late 2006, they were also used in many of SGI's computer products. MIPS implementations were also used by Digital Equipment Corporation, NEC, Pyramid Technology, Siemens Nixdorf, Tandem Computers and others during the late 1980s and 1990s. In the mid to late 1990s, it was estimated that one in three RISC microprocessors produced was a MIPS implementation.

Freelan Oscar Stanley

Freelan Oscar Stanley (1849 – 1940), was an American educator, inventor and manufacturer. He left teaching to join his twin brother Francis Edgar Stanley in the photographic dry plate business. After selling the business, the two brothers invented and manufactured the Stanley Steamer car. They were pioneers in the use of steam engines to power cars.
Freelan O. Stanley and his twin brother Francis E. Stanley were born on 1 June 1849 in Kingsfield, Maine. Their parents were Solomon and Apphia (French) Stanley. Solomon Stanley was both a farmer and a teacher. Freelan and his brother Francis graduated from Farmington State Normal School in Farmington, Maine. The school is now the University of Maine at Farmington. Freelan became a teacher and taught at Andover, Lisbon and Farmington, Maine. He later became principal of the high school at Mechanic Falls, Maine. In 1876 he met and married Flora Tileston.
In 1885 he and his twin brother left their jobs and started a company to make photographic plates for photographers. they sold their shop four years later when they moved to Watertown, Massachusetts. They started another photographic plate business, but sold it to Eastman Kodak in 1904. The photographic plate business had made both brothers very wealthy.
In 1896 Freelan and his brother Francis visited the Brockton County Fair. They saw a steam car and decided to build one themselves. In 1897 the two brothers began making steam-powered cars. Their steam cars had a much lighter boiler and a lighter steam engine than the rest. They were soon making about 200 cars a year. In 1899 they purchased a bicycle factory in Watertown and began building their cars. They then sold their car company to John B. Walker and Amzi L. Barber for $250,000 USD. With it they sold the rights to their car designs. The sale had a clause that the two Stanley brothers could not build and sell cars for two years. The Stanley brothers broke the clause and had to give their new design to the company Walker and Barber formed, the Locomobile Company of America. In 1901 Francis and Freelan Stanley formed a new car company, the Stanley Motor Carriage Company.
The cars they produced, called Stanley Steamers, had many advantages. The cost was $650. That was $300 less than the cost of a Ford Model T. The cars were very quiet and only made hissing sounds from the boiler. They had no transmission because there was no need to change gears as there was with gasoline-powered cars. Their cars began making news. In 1899, Freelan and his wife Flora drove one of these cars to the top of Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the highest peak in the northeastern United States. The ascent took more than two hours and was notable as being the first time a car had climbed the long Mount Washington Carriage Road. In 1906 a Stanley Steamer broke the land speed record at 127 miles per hour on a beach in Florida.
In business, the twins looked exactly alike and dressed the same. They even trimmed their beards the same. People they worked with said the only way to tell them apart was each had a different reaction when you told him a joke. As other car companies moved from steam to gasoline power, their Stanley Steamer became the most popular steam powered car. As the internal combustion engine designs improved, however, steam and electric cars lost much of their popularity. Finally, the numbers of cars sold went down to less than 600 a year in 1918. That year the Stanley brothers sold the company to Prescott Warren, a Chicago businessman. both brothers retired. A few months later, while he was driving home from a trip to Maine, Francis' car ran off the road. Francis was driving a new 1918 Model 735 Stanley Steamer. He died in the accident, July 21, 1918.
In 1903 Freelan came down with tuberculosis and was given less than a year to live. He and his wife Flora came to Colorado to try to improve his health. The couple fell in love with Estes Park, Colorado. Stanley's health began to improve and in 1906 he began building a large hotel. The site had spectacular views of Rocky Mountain National Park. He opened his hotel in 1909. It had luxuries (for that time) of telephones, electricity and indoor plumbing. He had a fleet of Stanley Steamers to bring guests to his hotel, named The Stanley Hotel. The Stanley Hotel was the inspiration behind Stephen King's book "The Shining". King wrote much of the book while he was a guest in room 217. Other famous guests of the hotel include Theodore Roosevelt, Molly Brown and the Emperor of Japan.
Stanley made a number of contributions to Estes Park. He built a hydroelectric plant to provide electricity to the town. He gave land for parks, a fairground and he improved roads in the area. He spent every summer in Estes Park for 37 years. He died on October 2, 1940 at age 91.

Eastman Kodak

Eastman Kodak Company was started by George Eastman and Henry A. Strong in 1881. They made their headquarters in Rochester, New York. It began as the Eastman Dry plate company. The company made Photographic plates for Photographers. It changed from a partnership to a corporation in 1884. In 1888 it changed its name again to the Eastman Kodak Company. This is when they released their first hand-held camera called the Kodak. It used a roll of photographic film which the company had started making in 1885. It was a camera simple enough for anyone to take pictures. Eastman Kodak re-invented photography and became an American success story. But their success would not last.
At first photographers used glass plates they had to coat with an emulsion. But they had to be used within minutes of being coated. They also had to be processed into a picture right away. In 1878, Eastman successfully created dry plates that could be coated with a gelatin solution. These could be used at the photographer's convenience. They did not require all the heavy equipment wet plates did. Eastman decided to go into business selling them. He invented a machine to mass-produce dry plates. In 1888, the company sold the first Kodak box cameras. The slogan was "you press the button, we do the rest". For $24 USD the camera came already loaded with film capable of taking 100 pictures. The camera was sent back to the factory where for $10 the film was developed into pictures. These cameras first used paper film but later turned to Nitrocellulose film. An indexing roller to hold film was invented by David Houston. It had square holes in the edge of the film to advance the film with no waste or Multiple exposures. But Eastman did not want to pay to license his patent. So they bought his patent in 1899. Kodak kept making dry plates until that market dried up. Their main profit was in film and film developing papers and chemicals. They made film for the movie industry, 16mm film for hobby filmmaking and cameras of all kinds. In the mid- 1920s they came out with color film. In 1929 Kodak created motion picture film for adding sound to motion pictures.
In 1947 Edward Land invented the Polaroid instant camera. The camera could develop its own pictures inside the camera in 60 seconds. Within five years Polaroid sold over a million cameras. Kodak took notice. Since Kodak held 80% of the market for photographic development, instant cameras were a real threat. Kodak quickly came out with their own instant camera. Land sued Kodak for $12 billion for using its technology. In the end Land won and Koday quit making instant cameras. But they won only a fraction of what they sued Kodak for and eventually went out of business in 2001. 
Fujifilm, the Japanese photography company, began selling inexpensive film in the United States in the 1980s. Since their film cost much less than Kodak's, by 1999 they had a large share of the film market. Kodak lost millions of dollars and had many layoffs. When Digital cameras became popular, Kodak quickly joined that market. By 1999 they were the second largest maker of digital cameras. But they lost $60 on each one they sold. 
Kodak made so many marketing mistakes that its stock dropped from $76 a share in 1999 to $25 in 2004. They dropped out of the film manufacturing business. Finally Kodak was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In 2012 the 131-year-company filed for bankruptcy. After selling off many of its products to other companies, Kodak came out of bankruptcy a much smaller company.

Off-site data protection

In computing, off-site data protection, or vaulting, is the strategy of sending critical data off the main site. The place where the data is stored is often called the data vault.
In many organisations, there is some data which is so important that it must be protected. Protection against hacking can be done by means of software, but protection against physical damage is a different problem. The solution is to put the data in more than one place, so a major disaster, (such as fire or explosions) does not prevent the recovery of the computer system with all its most important data.
Data is usually taken off-site using media such as magnetic tape or optical storage. Data can also be sent electronically to a remote backup service, which is called "electronic vaulting" or "e-vaulting". 
Sending backups off-site makes sure systems and servers can be reloaded with the latest data in the event of a disaster, accidental error, or system crash. Sending backups off-site also ensures there is a copy of data that is not stored on-site. Off-site backup services are convenient for companies that backup data on a daily basis (classified and unclassified).
Although some organizations manage and store their own off-site backups, many choose to have their backups managed and stored by others who specialize in the protection of off-site data.

Integrated development environment

An integrated development environment, or IDE, is a computer program that makes it easier to write other computer programs. They are used by computer programmers to edit source code, and can be easier to use than other text editors for new programmers. They can have compilers so programmers don't have to open other programs to compile the source code. They also often have syntax highlighting.

Syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting is where a text editor, integrated development environment or other computer program shows different parts of some source code in different colours. This makes it easier for computer programmers to read the source code and understand what it does. It can be done in different colors, and different programming languages have different rules about what parts of the source code need to be different colors.
This is an example comparing some C code without syntax highlighting and with syntax highlighting:

Graph (mathematics)

In graph theory a graph is used to represent the connection between two sets. One of the sets contains nodes (which are officially called vertices), the other one contains the connections (which are officially called edges). There are two classes of graphs, which are distinguished by the nature of the edges. Some edges can be travelled in both directions, other can only be travelled in one direction. Edges that can be travelled in one direction only are called "directed", and the graph is called a "directed graph "or" digraph". The ones which do not have a direction are called "undirected", and the graph is called an "undirected graph". If two vertices are connected by an edge, they are called "adjacent". 
The order of a graph, written as formula_1, is given by the number of vertices. A graph's size is formula_2, the number of edges. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges that connect to it, where an edge that connects to the vertex at both ends (a loop) is counted twice.
Vertices or edges may have weights. In general, weigts are used to show the costs associated with using the respective vertex or edge. In a graph that shows the cities of a region, the cost associated with a vertex may be the distance between two cities, or the amount of time it takes to travel between the two.
A graph were there is more than one edge between two vertices is called multigraph, one where there is at most one edge is called a simple graph. A loop is an edge that connects to the same vertex. Loops are only allowed in multigraphs. 
A simple graph, where every vertex is directly connected to every other is called complete graph. 
A sequence of vertices where two vertices which are next to each other in the sequence are connected by an edge is called a path. 
A path which starts and ends at the same edge is called a cycle. The directed graph below with a cycle has the paths "BCEDB, CEDBC, EDBCE andDBCED" which are cycles.

Tabby cat

Tabby cat, also known as grey tiger, or simply tabby is the name for domestic cats with fur coats of stripes, dots, lines or swirling patterns. These cats often have a mark that looks like the letter "M" on their foreheads. Tabbies are not a cat breed. 
The tabby pattern is in many pure breeds of cats, as well as in mixed breeds. The tabby pattern happens naturally because of cats' closest ancestor, the African Wildcat. It has the same colors and patterns. 
There are four tabby patterns that are genetically different: mackerel, classic, spotted, and ticked.
There is also a fifth pattern that includes tabby as part of another basic color pattern. The "patched" tabby is a calico or tortoiseshell cat with tabby patches (also known as "caliby" and "torbie").
Mackerel is the most common tabby pattern. The legs and tail have dark bars as do the cat's cheeks. A "mackerel tabby" has narrow stripes that run in parallel down its sides. This is what some people refer to as a "tiger." An "M" shape appears on the forehead along with dark lines across the cat's cheeks to the corners of its eyes. Mackerels are also called 'Fishbone tabbies' probably because of the mackerel fish. A mackerel tabby pattern is the only striped coat pattern seen in domestic cats. The mackerel tabby pattern is the original tabby pattern.
The classic tabby cat (also known as "blotched" or "marbled") has a pattern usually in the colors of dark brown, ochre, and black; but sometimes grey. Classic tabbies have the "M" pattern on their foreheads too. The body is marked with a whirled or swirled pattern (often called a "bullseye") on the cat's sides. There is also a light colored "butterfly" pattern on the shoulders and three thin stripes (the center stripe is dark) running along its spine. Classic tabbies have dark stripes on their legs, tail, and cheeks.
A ticked tabby pattern makes a grizzly color of fur of dark and light bands or bars. These break up the tabby pattern into a "salt-and-pepper" look. Some stripes or bars can often be seen on the lower legs, face and belly and sometimes at the end of the cat's tail.
The spotted tabby has a gene that breaks up the mackerel tabby pattern so that the stripes appear as spots. Sometimes, the stripes of a classic tabby's pattern may be broken into larger spots. Both large spot and small spot patterns can be seen in the Australian Mist, Bengal, Egyptian Mau, Maine Coon, and Ocicat breeds.
The mackerel tabby pattern was the first tabby pattern in domestic cats. It is believed to have come from the African Wildcat and the European Wildcat. Both of these wild cats have a pale, striped tabby pattern. But when those breeds mixed, it made a more distinct mackerel tabby coat. At first, the mackerel tabby was common in all domestic cats. But later, other tabby patterns happened because of mutations and selective breeding of the mackerel tabby. All domestic cats have the tabby gene. But the genes of some cat breeds hide the tabby appearance.

He was awarded the 1961 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work. Calvin spent most of his five-decade career at the University of California, Berkeley.
Using the carbon-14 isotope as a tracer, Calvin and colleagues mapped the complete route that carbon travels through a plant during photosynthesis. It starts with its absorption as atmospheric carbon dioxide, and ends with its conversion into carbohydrates and other organic compounds.
They showed that sunlight acts on the chlorophyll in a plant to fuel the manufacture of organic compounds. Calvin was the sole recipient of the 1961 Nobel Prize for Chemistry. He wrote an autobiography three decades later titled "Following the trail of light: a scientific odyssey".
During the 1950s he was among the first members of the Society for General Systems Research. In 1963 he was given the additional title of Professor of Molecular Biology.

The National Assembly for Wales () is a devolved assembly with the power to make laws in Wales. It is also called "the Welsh Assembly".
The Assembly was created after the "Government of Wales Act 1998" law, which was introduced after a referendum in 1997. The Assembly had no powers to make "primary legislation" until the "Government of Wales Act 2006" law, which gave the Assembly limited powers to make laws.
Its powers were increased again after a Yes vote in a referendum on 3 March 2011, which allowed the Assembly to make laws without having to ask the UK parliament, or the Secretary of State for Wales.
The Assembly has 60 members, called Assembly Members, or AMs for short. In Welsh, they are called "Aelod y Cynulliad".
Assembly Members are elected for 4 years in an "additional members system - "40 AMs are elected by the "plurality system, "and represent the different areas of Wales. Another 20 AMs from 5 electoral regions are also elected, by the "proportional representation system."

Dry plate

Dry plate, also known as gelatin process, is an improved type of photographic plate. It was invented by Dr. Richard L. Maddox in 1871. By 1879 the first dry plate factory had been established. With much of the complex chemical work done at the factory, the new process simplified the work of photographers. 
The first practical way to take photographs was called the daguerreotype. It was introduced in 1839. It used sheets of copper coated with silver. The plate was then was exposed to chemical fumes, then taken to the camera. Introduced in the 1850s the Collodion process was introduced. It used what were called wet plates. But a wet plate had to be prepared and used within minutes. It also had a very slow photographic speed. The preparation of wet plates required numerous chemicals. These had to be mixed in the dark in a portable tent if the photographer was planning on photographing away from the studio. In the 1880s the gelatin dry plate replaced the wet plates. The dry plate allowed much faster exposure times. Now a moving subject could be captured on film. The dry plates could be manufactured in a factory and used whenever the photographer wanted.

Dogs in Space

Dogs in Space is a 1986 Australian drama movie about Melbourne's little band scene in 1978. It was directed by Richard Lowenstein. It starred Michael Hutchence as Sam, a drugged dazed singer of a band named Dogs in Space.
The story was from Lowenstein's personal experience of living in a shared house in Melbourne in the late 1970s. Lowenstein had already worked with Michael Hutchence making rock videos. He also produced video clips for songs from the INXS album "The Swing". He wrote the lead role of Sam with Michael Hutchence in mind. 
The character Sam is about a real member of a punk rock band that Lowenstein had lived with in the 1970s. The house in the movie was the one they had shared. It was rented from its new owners and changed back to its original condition for the movie. The cost for the deconstruction of the house was part of the movie's budget.
Copies of "Dogs in Space" are being preserved by the National Film and Sound Archive in Canberra. This means the movie will be protected from damage that happens to older film that was used to make movies.
A group of young music fans share a house in the inner Melbourne suburb of Richmond. It is not too far away from the city to be an active part of the music scene. Sam and Tim are members of a band named Dogs in Space. They share the house with a group of social misfits and quite troubled young people. These include Sam's girlfriend Anna and a really smart university student, Luchio. He is actually trying to study for exams even in the confusion of the house. There is also a nameless teenager, who is just called The Girl. She comes and goes; sometimes sleeping over.
The scenes cover the day-to-day lives of the characters, mainly the sexual relationship between Sam and Anna. There are many party scenes with live music and drug use. During quiet times, the housemates move the television outdoors into the street to watch it on sofas and eat junk food and drink beer. The group makes frequent trips to a convenience store to restock. 
Footage of Sputnik 2 is intermittently seen in the movie (in tribute to the title: "Dogs in Space"). The footage mostly shows Laika, the first Soviet Union dog in space. These scenes can also be seen in the background when the television is playing. There are trips to many local pubs for live punk music. In the end, the group's dangerous lifestyle costs a life of a loved one. Anna dies from a heroin overdose.
There was a punk rock soundtrack album released with the following songs and artists. The album and the later CD are both out of print. Rare copies sell well and fetch the asking price.

The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) is a 1987 agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union. It was signed in Washington, D.C. by U.S. President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev on December 8, 1987.
It was ratified by the United States Senate on May 27, 1988 and came into force on June 1 of that year. The treaty is formally titled The Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles.
The treaty eliminated nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with intermediate ranges of 500-5,500 km (300-3,400 miles).
In 2012 the United States complained about Russian treaty violations. The two systems that appear to be violations are the R-500, a cruise missile using the 9K720 Iskander launcher, and a short ranged ICBM. 
In July 2014, the United States formally notified Russia of the breach, while Russian officials called the treaty unsuitable for Russia and unfair because other countries in Asia had such weapons. Russia later attacked the United States by calling American drones a "violation of the treaty".

Biological pigment

Biological pigments are pigments which are chemical colours.
The colours of plants and animals have various functions. Chlorophyll is the green pigment used to collect light energy for photosynthesis in plants. Many colours on plants and animals work to change the behaviour of animals. They can be seen, and they act as a means of camouflage, warning or attraction (pollination; mating).
The common dark pigment melanin often has the function of protection against sunlight (ultraviolet radiation).
Pigments are different from structural colors. Pigments look the same from all angles. Structural color is the result of reflection or iridescence. For this reason, structural colors look different from different viewing angles. As an example, the wings of butterflies commonly use structural color.

Structural color

Structural coloration is a coloring that results from the special structure of the surface. Sometimes structural coloration is combined with pigments: for example, peacock tail feathers are pigmented brown, but their structure makes them appear blue, turquoise, and green, and often they appear iridescent.
English scientists Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton were the first who observed structural coloration. Thomas Young described its principle a century later and called it wave interference. Young described iridescence as the result of interference between reflections from several surfaces of thin films, combined with refraction as light enters and leaves such films. The geometry then determines that at certain angles, the light reflected from both surfaces adds (interferes constructively), while at other angles, the light subtracts. As a result, different colors appear at different angles.

Fast casual restaurant

A fast casual restaurant is a type of restaurant invented in the United States. It aims to fill the gap between fast food joints and more formal restaurants.
This type of restaurant does not offer full table service. It gives a higher quality of food than fast food places. The fast casual restaurants use fewer frozen or processed ingredients than a fast food restaurant. 
The promoters of this idea see it as fitting between fast food and what they call "casual dining". By 'casual dining' they mean chains like TGI Friday's and Applebee's in the U.S. and Harvester in the U.K. 
The typical cost per meal in a fast casual is in the $8–$15 range. Typical examples of fast casual restaurants in the U.S. are Chipotle Mexican Grill, Culvers, and Panera.

Buffet

A buffet is a serve-yourself food system. 
Food is placed in a public area where the diners choose what they want. 
Buffets are now usual in many hotels for breakfast, and sometimes for other meals. They are also common at social events, where people stand up to eat and talk.
Buffet restaurants usually offer all-you-can-eat food for a set price. Buffets usually have some hot dishes. The term cold buffet (see Smörgåsbord) has been developed to describe buffets lacking hot food. Hot or cold buffets usually involve dishware and utensils, but a finger buffet is designed for small pieces taken by hand, such as cupcakes, slices of pizza, foods on cocktail sticks, etc.
The essential feature of the various buffet formats is that the diners can see the food and immediately select which dishes they wish to eat, and usually also can decide how much food they take. Buffets are effective for serving large numbers of people at once, and are often seen in institutional settings, such as business conventions or large parties.
Buffets grade into cafeterias when there is a serving counter and the customer moves with a tray along a track.

Battle of Jena-Auerstadt

The Battle of Jena-Auerstadt was fought on October 14, 1806. It was part of the War of the Fourth Coalition. It was fought between the French and the Prussians. The battle was a victory for Napoleon of France and he conquered Prussia.
In 1806 the Fourth Coalition was formed by Great Britain, Sweden, Russia, and Prussia against Napoleon and France. Napoleon invaded Prussia in the fall. Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel commanded the Prussians at Jena-Auerstadt. He was 71 years old while his field commanders were in their 60s. The Prussian army was still using tactics and training of Frederick II of Prussia. Its greatest weakness was its staff organization. Most of the divisions were poorly organized and did not communicate well with each other. Napoleon's army was experienced and well led. The armies met at Jena-Auerstadt on October 14, 1806.
The Prussian army was split into three forces- 
75,000 under the Duke of Brunswick.
42,000 under the Prince of Hohenlohe.
15,000 under Ernst von Rüchel
The French Army at Jena was made up of 150,000 men total-
Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult's IV Corps
Jean Lannes' V Corps
Michel Ney's VI Corps 
Pierre Augereau's VII Corps
Joachim Murat's cavalry
At Auerstadt the French forces were Louis Nicolas Davout's III Corps and Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's 1 Corps.
The first French movements were to attack the Prussian flanks. Once in position, Marshal Ney attacked without orders. At first Ney's attack was successful, but he was soon cut off and under attack by the Prussians. Napoleon sent Marshal Lannes to help out. The French center was left weak, however, Napoleon deployed the Imperial Guard in the center and kept the Guard under his direct command. The rescue worked and Ney units were able to retreat. The Prussians did not take the initiative and attack. At 1 P.M. Napoleon made his move. The French flanks pushed hard against the Prussian flanks, and the French center attacked the Prussian center. The flank attacks worked and Prussians fled. They lost 10,000 men, 15,000 men were taken prisoner and 150 cannons were lost.
Marshal Davout's III Corps was at the small village of Auerstedt. The Duke of Brunswick attacked with 60,000 men. However, the Prussians made piecemeal attacks, and the French held them off for 6 hours. Brunswick was mortally wounded and Prussian command broke down. The French destroyed the last Prussians assault and won the battle. 
At the end of the day Napoleon still did not know what was going on. Instead of directing his corps commanders he took charge himself. He forgot to send orders to several of his corps. He thought he had defeated the entire Prussian army when in fact he had only partially defeated them. There was still a large Prussian army of about 100,000 who were not in the battle. Napoleon didn't think Davout had completely beaten the Prussians and said "tell your marshal he is seeing double", a reference to Davout's bad eyesight. Davout was made Duke of Auerstadt. The French Army marched into Berlin and then peace terms were signed between France and Prussia.

Myosins are a group of specialized proteins used for muscle contraction and motion in eukaryotic cells. Myosins need ATP for energy to do these functions. A large number of different myosin genes have been discovered in eukaryotes. 
The structure and function of myosin is strongly conserved across species. For example, Rabbit muscle myosin II will bind to actin from an amoeba.
Most myosin molecules are composed of a head part, a neck part, and a tail part.
Many myosin molecules can make muscles get shorter using the energy released from breaking apart ATP molecules into ADP and a phosphate group. The power stroke happens when a phosphate that n broken off gets released from the myosin. This makes the myosin change shape so that it pulls against the actin. When the ADP molecule is released and a new ATP molecule joins onto the myosin head, the head releases from the actin. The myosin breaks the new ATP and the cycle keeps going. The combined effect of all the power strokes from all the different myosin molecules makes the muscle get shorter.

Montferrat (Piedmontese: "Monfrà"; ; ) is part of the region of Piedmont in Northern Italy. It is both a historical and geographic area. It includes either a part of the Province of Alessandria, or a part of the Province of Asti. In the Middle Ages, it was a small marquisate (meaning a "small reign"), inside the Kingdom of Italy. Montferrat is famous worldwide for its soft and green hills. It produces award-winning wines, including Asti wine, Barbera and Moscato d'Asti. In June 2014, Montferrat, along with Langhe was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its unique characteristics. 
Montferrat has three areas:
Montferrat has a strong culinary culture. It is one of the most important producers in the world of cheese, white truffle and other products of nature, such as vegetables, cereals and fruits. One of the best-known dishes of Monferrato is Agnolotti, which are a special type of filled pasta.

Ocicat

The Ocicat is a breed of cat. It looks like a wild cat but has no wild DNA in its gene pool. The Ocicat is spotted like a wild cat but is tame and has the behavior of a domestic animal. It got its name because it looks like an ocelot. The breed started accidentally by mating Siameses and Abyssinians. Later, American Shorthairs (silver tabby cats) were added to the mix. This gave the breed their silver color, bone structure and patterns. Now, the Ocicat is a popular breed all over the world.
There are twelve fur coat colors accepted for the Ocicat breed: tawny, chocolate and cinnamon, blue, lavender and fawn. As well, all have a shade of silver: black silver (ebony silver), chocolate silver, cinnamon silver, blue silver, lavender silver and fawn silver. Ocicats have eyes shaped like almonds. They have large strong bodies, legs with dark markings, and oval shaped paws. The eyes are usually rimmed with dark fur. These cats have dark spots all over their fur that are darker than their background color. The Ocicat's large, muscled body gives them a look of power and strength.
Most Ocicats are friendly and are not shy. This makes them good family pets. Most can also get along well with other animals. Their mood and actions are similar to those of a dog. Most can be trained to fetch toys, walk on a leash, come when called, and other dog-related tricks. Some even like the water. They are playful and like toys very much. So these pets need attention from their owners.
The first breeder of Ocicats was Virginia Daly, in Michigan, who tried to breed an Abyssinian-pointed Siamese in 1964. Her kittens looked like Abyssinians. But when they were later mated, there was not only an Abyssinian-pointed Siamese, but a spotted kitten,Tonga. The breeder's daughter, nicknamed Tonga an 'ocicat'. Tonga was sold as a pet, but his parent cats had more spotted kittens. This began the Ocicat breed. Other breeders then also did the same steps. They mated Siamese cats to Abyssinians, and then those cat descendents to Siameses to get Ocicat kittens. The Ocicat was accepted in The Cat Fanciers' Association and was first shown for championships in 1987.

Brasserie

Brasserie, in France and nowadays in Britain, means a type of French restaurant. It has a relaxed setting, and serves single dishes and other meals. The word 'brasserie' is also French for "brewery". In the beginning, it was used for the place where the beer was brewed. Often these places served the beer they brewed, together with a meal. 
A brasserie has professional service, printed menus, and (traditionally) white linen—unlike a bistro which may have none of these. Typically, a brasserie is open every day of the week and serves the same menu all day.
In 1901 "Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language" defined 'brasserie' as "in France, any beer-garden or saloon". In 2000 "The New Penguin English Dictionary" had this definition of 'brasserie': "a small informal French-style restaurant".

Steam car

A steam car is an automobile (car) powered by a steam engine. The first automobile, a Three-wheeled vehicle, was powered by a steam engine. 
The steam carriage was invented in 1769 by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot, a French engineer. It was a large three wheeled vehicle that used coal to make steam in a boiler. The boiler was mounted in front which made the vehicle unstable.
In the United States, about the time of the American Civil War, a number of inventors were working on steam-powered cars. In England about 1868 J. H. Knight had created a very successful design of steam car. In 1883 in France, Jules-Albert de Dion and Georges Bouton began building steam cars. In 1886 Ransom E. Olds was producing a steam car in the US. In 1899 the Stanley brothers, Francis and Freelan began making the famous Stanley Steamers.
Steam engines in cars have a great amount of torque. With all this torque they can accelerate very quickly. Because the torque is available over a broad range of speeds, a transmission wasn't needed. They could also carry heavy loads with ease. The speed of a steam car is controlled by the throttle alone and the engine never stalls. Steam cars had fewer moving parts than gasoline powered cars. Also steam cars are very quiet.
A major disadvantage is that a steam car has to "fire up" its boiler (has to get up to operating temperature). This can take as much as 20 minutes before the car can move. In the winter there was the added problem of water freezing. A steam car could not go very far without adding water. The water turned to steam, which was lost as exhaust when it exited the engine. Steam condensers were added to these cars later. This converted the steam back to water. But they came too late. By then steam cars had lost out to cars with gasoline (and diesel) engines.

Principal photography

Principal photography is the part of movie making when a movie is being filmed. It is after pre-production and before post-production.
Principal photography is usually the most expensive part of movie making. This is partly because the cost includes salaries for the actors and crew. It is also because some movie scenes are expensive if they include special props or special effects that are done on the set.
Feature movies usually have insurance when principal photography starts. This is in case something happens that makes the movie cost more to make. For example, if one of the actors dies before filming all his or her scenes, the scenes might have to be filmed again with a different actor. If sets or finished parts of the movie are destroyed, it might even be impossible to finish the movie.

Dreadnoughtus is a genus of giant titanosaurian dinosaur. Its fossilised skeleton was found in the Upper Cretaceous of Santa Cruz province, Argentina. These rocks date from 84–66 million years ago (mya).
This is one of the largest of all known terrestrial vertebrates. It has the greatest mass (weight) of any land animal that has been calculated. They used using limb bone measurements for the calculation. 
"Dreadnoughtus schrani" is the most complete skeleton of a large titanosaurian sauropod dinosaur. Types of bones is the most important statistic. The completeness statistics for "Dreadnoughtus schrani" are as follows:
The specimen was probably not fully grown at the time of its death. The histology of its humerus, shows a lack of an outer layer of bone found only in fully-grown vertebrates. There is a lot of fast-deposited or still-growing bone tissue. Therefore, the specimen was still growing at the time of its death. It is unknown how large this individual would have grown if it had lived a full life.
As a matter of basic science, the estimates of dimensions such as the mass (weight) of extinct animals are very rough figures. To avoid the pretence of spurious accuracy. we only give rounded figures here. Moreover. all the skeletons are incomplete, which means that even length (the easiest dimension to estimate) cannot be given exactly. Published estimates by scientists are just that: "estimates". Estimation is an approximation given when information is not clear or is incomplete. It is like making an educated guess.
It is usual for estimates of mass (weight) to vary between experts. Using the same basic data, the weight of "Dreadnoughtus" has been estimated as:
There is a ~x2 difference between the heaviest and lightest estimates, and that is not at all unusual for this type of calculation.

Data vault modeling

Data vault modeling is a database modeling method that tries to preserve different sets of historical data from different sources. It is also a method of looking at historical data that deals with issues such as auditing, tracing of data, loading speed and resilience to change.
Data Vault Modeling focuses on several things. First, it emphasizes the need to trace where all the data in the database came from. Each row has extra attributes that describe where the data came from, and at what time it was loaded. This feature lets auditors find the source of the values.
Data vault modeling does not distinguish between data that conforms to the business rules and data that does not. The data that does not conform is generally called "bad data". Dan Linstedt, who developed the technology, said that a data vault modeling stores "a single version of the facts". In other data warehouse modeling schemes, the data warehouse generally stores "a single version of the truth", data that does not conform to the business rules is removed. 
Because data vault modeling stores the source of the data separately from the data itself, it can cope with change in the business environment. It does this by explicitly separating structural information from descriptive attributes.
Finally, Data Vault is designed to enable parallel loading as much as possible, so that very large implementations can scale out without the need for major redesign.

Query by Example

Query by Example (commonly shortened to QBE) is a database query language for relational databases. It was developed at IBM in the 1970s. The development of SQL ran in parallel. QBE was developed for those users who only use databases occasionally, and who do not want to learn a complex language such as SQL. 
With Query by example, users are presented with a visual schema of the database, which they edit with a special editor. When they are done, a parser translates their actions into a query in a regular query language such as SQL. Behind the scenes, it is this statement that is actually executed. With a suitable front-end, the user does not need to remember the details of a query language. The user will be able to select tables and columns more quickly, for example by clicking on them, rather than typing their names. This will improve productivity.
In the context of information retrieval, QBE has a somewhat different meaning. The user can submit a document and ask for "similar" documents to be retrieved from a document database. Similarity search is based comparing document vectors (see Vector Space Model).
Today, many database systems have front-ends that resemble QBE.

Ala-ud-din Khalji (died 1316) was the most powerful ruler of the Khalji Dynasty. He ruled from 1296 to 1316. He was the nephew (and son-in-law) of Jalal-ud-din Khalji. His son was Khusrau Malik. 
Ala-ud-din Khalji first conquered Gujarat and Malwa. In 1301 he conquered Ranthambore. In 1303 he captured Chittor. Then he sent a large army headed by his general Malik Kafur to South India. Malik Kafur defeated the Yadavas, Kakatiyas, Hoysalas and the Pandyas. He also took away a lot of wealth. Around the end of his reign, his empire was as large as that of Ashoka the Great (274 BC–232 BC).
Khalji needed money to keep a large army. The main sources were taxes. The land tax was fixed according to the fertility of the land. The land tax in the fertile Ganga-Yamuna doab was one-half of the produce. He kept a strict check on the nobles. A group of officers were kept to discourage corruption. He introduced a system of auditing accounts.
He introduced a market control policy in which he reduced the price of day to day items such as sugar, oil, cloth etc. Shop owners had to pay the amount fixed by Ala-ud-din Khalji. Officials were appointed to check the shop owners. Whoever was caught cheating, was punished. This allowed Khalji to pay a low salary to the soldiers.
With money available to him he maintained a large army. He paid his soldiers in cash. He even started branding horses ( Dagh). This was to prevent the substitution of good horses with low quality horses. He even kept a description of all soldiers in his army (Chehra). He posted spies throughout the empire to prevent rebellions.

Locomobile Company of America

The Locomobile Company of America was a company founded in 1899 by John B. Walker. He and his partner Amzi L. Barber bought the rights to manufacture the steam car built by the Stanley brothers. They called the car the Locomobile. In 1904 the company began producing gasoline-powered cars and continued in business until 1929. 
Francis E. Stanley and Freelan O. Stanley had invented a steam car. In 1899 they purchased a bicycle factory in Watertown, Massachusetts and began building their cars. John B. Walker, the owner of Cosmopolitan magazine, offered to buy half the company. The Stanley brothers said no. When Walker came back a few weeks later he offered to buy the whole car company. The brothers thought about it and set the price at $250,000 USD. The set the price high enough they thought nobody would pay it. But Walker did and the two Stanley brothers stayed on to run the factory. Walker's partner was Amzi L. Barber. They called the new company Locomobile.
Within a few months Walker and Barber had a disagreement and split the company. Walker took his half and formed a new company in Tarrytown, New York. He called his car 'the Mobile'; a Stanley Steamer with his logo on it. With poor sales Walker closed his company in 1902. Barber kept the Locomobile name and sold 5,200 cars by 1902. The Locomobile steam cars were a little difficult to operate and sometimes had fires. They could only go about 20 miles before needing water. They needed to be warmed up for about 30 minutes before they could be driven. By 1904 only about 200 cars were sold. Locomobile sold the patents and the design for their steam car back to the Stanley brothers. By 1904 Locomobile had switched to making gasoline cars.
At about the same time Locomobile switched over to making gasoline powered cars, Barber left the business. His son-in-law, J.J. Albright, took over as company president. Inventor Andrew Riker became the lead designer and was responsible for the new gasoline engines.
The 1904 5-passenger touring car used an Inline-four engine that was water-cooled engine that produced about 16 horsepower. At the time it cost $4,500. In 1905 Locomobile entered cars in Auto racing. It was in 1908 they won the Vanderbilt Cup. A car that won a race gained an excellent reputation. They advertised the Locomobile as “Easily the Best Built Car in America.” They continued to improve their car. In 1922 Locomobile was acquired by the Durant Motor Company. But their cars continued to be made under the name Locomobile. They continued to build their reputation for making high performance luxury cars. In 1929 the company fell victim to the Great Depression and closed its doors.

Plasmodesma

Plasmodesma (plural is 'plasmodesmata') is a microscopic channel across the cell wall of a plant cell. It allows transport and communication between neighbouring cells. Plasmodesmata also evolved independently in some algae. 
Unlike animal cells, every plant cell is surrounded by a polysaccharide cell wall. Neighbouring plant cells are therefore separated by a pair of cell walls. Although cell walls are permeable to small soluble molecules, plasmodesmata allow direct, regulated, intercellular transport of substances between cells.
Similar structures connect animal cells. Stromules form between plastids in plant cells.

Phospholipids are a type of fat that contain phosphorus. They are major parts of all cell membranes because they form lipid bilayers. 
Phospholipid molecules usually have hydrophobic tails and a hydrophilic head. Biological membranes in eukaryotes also contain another class of lipid, sterols. These are spaced out among the phospholipids. Together they provide membrane fluidity and mechanical strength. Purified phospholipids are produced commercially and have found applications in nanotechnology and materials science.

Clerk

A clerk is someone who writes. The word is derived from the Greek "κληρικός" ("klērikos"), meaning "of the clergy". Once only religious people could write, so a cleric meant a religious person.
In early mediaeval courts, writing was mainly done by clergy because most men, including nobles, could not read. In a medieval context, the word "clerk" meant "scholar". Now almost everyone can read and write, but the term 'clerk' still correctly applies to whole professions such as accountants, lawyers and civil servants. There is such a person as the Clerk of the House of Commons, and every court in England has a legally qualified clerk. Their job is to keep the records, and run the behind-the-scenes business.

Indigenous South African marriage

The indigenous African concept of marriage is a socio-legal bond between two clans around a man and a wife and forged through the ukulobola covenant and the delivery of ikhazi goods consisting of cattle and/or other valuables from the husband’s family to the wife’s. This bond binds the two clans to a permanent ‘in-laws’ relationship that gets strengthened by the procreation of children. The wife gets transferred from her clan where she enjoyed her maiden status as a princess inkosazana to her marital home where she is elevated to the status of the queen inkosikazi of the household. She excels in her stature as a paragon of love, care, diligence, reliability and resourcefulness. Symbolically a married woman is seen as a hen that spreads its wings to keep all the clan members including the young, the elderly, the sick and the orphans warm, served and satisfied.

Barnett Newman

Barnett Newman (January 29, 1905 – July 4, 1970) was an American artist. He is one of the major figures in abstract expressionism, and a leading "color field" painter.
Newman was born in New York City, the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland. He studied philosophy at the City College of New York and worked in his father's business making clothing. He later made a living as a teacher, writer and critic. From the 1930s on he made paintings said to be in an expressionist style. He later destroyed all these works. 
Throughout the 1940s he worked in a surrealist vein before developing his mature style. This has areas of pure color separated by thin vertical lines, or "zips" as Newman called them. In the first works featuring zips, the color fields are variegated, but later the colors are pure and flat. Newman himself thought that he reached his fully mature style with the Onement series (from 1948). The zips define the spatial structure of the painting, while simultaneously dividing and uniting the composition..
Newman died of a heart attack in New York City. He was unappreciated as an artist for much of his life, being overlooked in favour of more colorful characters such as Jackson Pollock. He was not a fan of Mark Rothko, his great rival in color field painting. Some critics wrote admiringly about him, but it was not until the end of his life that he began to be taken seriously. He was, however, an important influence on many younger artists.

New Valley Project

The New Valley Project consists of building a number of canals, to be able to irrigate parts of the desert in Egypt for the purpose of agriculture. The project was started in 1997. Its main canal should cover a distance of . In 2012, it was still away from the oasis it was supposed to reach. Other problems of the project include the fact that the soil is very salty in the desert, and that there are underground aquifers, which are a problem for the canals. When the land is irrigated, the salt would mix with the aquifers and would reduce access to drinking water. The clay minerals found in the soil are posing technical problems to the big wheeled structures moving around autonomously to irrigate the land. Often their wheels get stuck in a little bowl created by wet clay that dried, and the irrigation machines come to a standstill. The only objective met up to April 2012 is the diversion of water from Lake Nasser into what little of the Sheikh Zayed Canal has been built.
The Toshka Lakes are a by-product of the rising level of Lake Nasser and lie in the same general region as much of the New Valley Project.

Qutb Shah

Qutb Shah or Qutub Shah was a fictitious person, a Folk hero who never existed in history but according to many stories and legends, he ruled in Herat Afghanistan sometime around 960 AD and then shifted to India. 
The actual story of a legendary ruler of Herat, in Afghanistan, was started much later in the 18th or 19th century by some Punjabi tribes, like the Awan tribe, Khokhar, Khattar and others. All these tribes were inter-linked and were of indigenous (native) Indian Hindu origins but they wanted to impress the colonial rulers of British India by claiming to be descended from an Arab who came and settled in India, after ruling in Afghanistan, so they made up a fictitious ancestor who was a 'hero' and won many battles and then left Afghanistan and came to India and married local Hindu women, and had several children who founded these tribes.
In 1860s to 1940s, a number of British rulers came to believe this story too and mentioned it in their books, but more recent historical research by Prof Ahmad Hasan Dani and others has confirmed that there never existed any person in recorded history by that name, at any time, either in Afghanistan or Northern India.

Jennie Wade

Mary Virginia "Jennie" (sometimes "Ginnie") Wade (May 21, 1843 – July 3, 1863), was a woman from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. She was the only Gettysburg civilian killed directly during the Battle of Gettysburg. The house where she was killed is now a museum called the "Jennie Wade House."
Wade was born in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The house where she was born still stands. When she was a young woman, she and her mother worked as seamstresses. They lived in a house on Breckenridge Street. Wade's father was a tailor. He lived in a psychiatric hospital.
Wade may have been engaged to marry Johnston Hastings "Jack" Skelly. He was an officer in the Union Army. His picture was found in her pocket after her death. Skelly was wounded in the Second Battle of Winchester. He died from his injuries on July 12, 1863. He did not know that Wade had died days earlier. Skelly and Wade were childhood friends. Only one letter between the two survived the war. There was nothing in it about a romantic relationship.
The first day of the Battle of Gettysburg was July 1, 1863. Early in the morning, Wade and others went to the house of Wade's sister, Georgia McClellan. They planned to help Georgia with her five-day-old baby. 
McClellan's house was at 528 Baltimore Street. That was between the armies of the North (the Union) and the South (the Confederacy). The house was hit by 150 bullets during the battle. An artillery shell went through the roof. It did not explode. It stayed where it fell for the next 15 years.
In the early morning of July 3, 1863, Wade was in the kitchen of her sister's home. She was making biscuits and bread for Union soldiers. A bullet came through two doors and hit Wade. It went through her left shoulder blade and through her heart. It stopped in her corset. She was killed instantly. Nobody knows which side fired the shot. Some writers say it was an unknown Confederate soldier. Jennie Wade was the only Gettysburg civilian killed directly during the Battle of Gettysburg.
Three Union soldiers found Wade's body almost right away. They told the rest of her family. The family took shelter in the cellar. Wade's body was placed in a coffin that was meant for a Confederate officer. She was buried in the back yard of her sister's house. On July 4, Wade's mother finished making the bread from the dough that Wade had prepared. In January 1864, Wade's body was moved to the cemetery of the German Reformed Church on Stratton Street in Gettysburg.
Wade received much attention from newspaper writers after her death. Most writers called her a heroine. Some writers did not have good things to say about her. She was accused of having visitors late at night. Other writers said that she was too friendly with Confederate soldiers.
In November 1865, Wade's body was buried in the Evergreen Cemetery in Gettysburg near Jack Skelly. Gettysburg resident Anna M. Miller designed a monument to Wade. It was put in the cemetery in 1900. This monument includes a Flag of the United States that flies around the clock. The Betsy Ross House in Philadelphia is the only other site devoted to a woman that has a flag flying at all times.

Rob Pilatus

Robert Pilatus (also "Rob"; June 8, 1964 or 1965 – April 2, 1998) was an American-German model, dancer and singer. He and musician Fabrice Morvan were the musical group Milli Vanilli.
Pilatus and Morvan released an album called "Girl You Know It's True". This album sold seven million copies. Later people learned that Pilatus and Morvan did not actually sing on the album. When they performed songs from the album on stage, they had lip-synched instead of singing.
After not making a record for a long time, Pilatus and Morvan made the album "Rob & Fab". That album sold only 2,000 copies. The record label went bankrupt shortly thereafter.
Pilatus was born in Munich to a German mother and African-American father. He was adopted as an infant and raised in Munich. He tried to commit suicide many times. He was found dead in a Frankfurt hotel from a mix of alcohol and prescription pill accidental overdose. He was in his early 30s.

Savannah cat

The Savannah cat is a breed of cat. It is the size of a medium dog. The breed is a combination of the serval and the domestic cat. It is a hybrid feline developed by crossing a domestic cat with a serval for a number of generations.
The bodies of Savannahs are long and leggy. When a Savannah is standing, its hind-end is often higher than its shoulders. The small head is taller than wide, and it has a long, slender neck. The backs of the ears have vivid marking, very clear in the first illustration. This is inherited from the serval cat. In the wild this lets kittens know where the mother is heading. In grass the kits can jump up to get a sight of their mothers' ears. This is important because servals can cover a lot of territory very quickly.
Serval cats can jump over 9 feet high from a standing start. Savannahs also jump high, but how high depends on the individual. They sometimes jump on top of doors, or onto shelves. They love the water. They have very few health issues. They make a hissing noise that sounds like a snake. Overall, they are active and intelligent. 
The most serval-like cats are the F1 hybrids. Most later crosses are Savannah to Savannah. That, and outcrosses to other breeds, make the cats less distinctive: see second illustration.
These cats are not allowed in Hawaii, Alabama, and some other U.S. states. They are banned from Australia. The reasoning is that their extra size and capability might put even more of its precious native animals at risk.
