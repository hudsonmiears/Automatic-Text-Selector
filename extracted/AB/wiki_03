Keystone species

A keystone species is a species which has a big effect on its environment relative to its numbers. The ecosystem depends on them, and would be much changed if they were not there. This is because they affect many other organisms in the ecosystem. They affect the types and numbers of other species in the community. 
Some sea stars (e.g. "Pisaster ochraceus") prey on sea urchins, mussels, and other shellfish that have no other natural predators. If the sea star is removed from the ecosystem, the mussel population explodes uncontrollably. This drives out most other species. The urchin population grows likewise, and destroys coral reefs. Living coral reefs are the habitat for many hundreds of other species.
Some other examples of keystone species are the sea otter, horseshoe crab, and wolves. Sea otters and kelp depend on each other. Without the sea otter, sea urchins would destroy the kelp, and much else in the ecosystem.

Fire of Manisa

The Fire of Manisa refers to the burning of the city of Manisa in Turkey by the Greek army. It happened during the Greco Turkish War of 1919-1922. The town was burned between 5 and 8 September 1922. More than 10,000 buildings were destroyed. This was about 90 percent of the town. Thousands of people died in the flames or were shot dead by the Greeks. Turkish sources claim 4,355 died and 300 girls were raped.
The town of Manisa was part of the Ottoman Empire. Turks and Greeks were living there together. The Greeks wanted Manisa to become part of Greece. In May 1919 a Greek army occupied the town. Then there was war between Greeks and Turks for three years. In the summer of 1922 Turks defeated the Greeks. The Greeks fled to the Aegean Sea to be transferred to Greece. During their retreat the Greeks burned towns and villages of Turks. Manisa too was burned down. The local Turks fled to the mountains. Most of the town was destroyed and later rebuilt. Some Turkish authors wrote about their experiences in Turkish literature.

Lady tasting tea

Lady tasting tea is the name of a famous randomized experiment designed by Ronald Fisher in 1935. The experiment is the original exposition of Fisher's notion of a null hypothesis. Fisher's description is less than ten pages long and is notable for its simplicity and completeness regarding terminology, calculations and design of the experiment. The example is loosely based on an event in Fisher's life. The lady in question was Muriel Bristol, and the test used was Fisher's exact test.
The lady in question claimed to be able to tell whether the tea or the milk was added first to a cup. Fisher proposed to give her eight cups, four of each variety, in random order. One could then ask what the probability was for her getting the number she got correct, but just by chance.
If and only if the Lady properly categorized all eight cups was Fisher willing to reject the null hypothesis – effectively acknowledging the Lady's ability at a 1.4% significance level (but without quantifying her ability). Fisher later discussed the benefits of more trials and repeated tests.
David Salsburg reports that a colleague of Fisher, H. Fairfield Smith, revealed that in the test, the woman got all eight cups correct. The chance of someone who just guesses getting all correct, assuming she guesses that four had the tea put in first and four the milk, would be only 1 in 70 (the combinations of 8 taken 4 at a time).
In popular science, Salsburg published a book entitled "The Lady Tasting Tea", which describes Fisher's experiment and ideas on randomization. Deb Basu wrote that "the famous case of the 'lady tasting tea'" was "one of the two supporting pillars . . . of the randomization analysis of experimental data".

Gram staining

Gram staining (or Gram's method) is a way of classifying bacteria into two large groups: gram-positive and gram-negative. The name comes from its inventor, Hans Christian Gram.
Gram's method stains bacteria according to the chemical and physical properties of their cell walls. First, a violet dye is put on the bacteria. This dye stains peptidoglycan, a thick layer that is only found in gram-positive bacteria. After the first stain, another stain (usually safranin or fuchsin) gives all gram-negative bacteria a red or pink colour. 
The Gram stain is almost always the first step in the identification of a bacterial organism. However, not all bacteria can be classified by this technique. Bacteria for which the method does not work are called 'gram-variable' or 'gram-indeterminate'.
Gram developed the technique working with another scientist, Carl Friedländer in a hospital in Berlin. However, Gram first used the test to make bacteria in the lungs easier to see. He published his finished method in 1884.

Dyatlov Pass incident

The Dyatlov Pass incident is an unsolved mystery to the deaths of nine ski hikers in the northern Ural mountains on the night of February 2, 1959. The incident happened on the east shoulder of the mountain Kholat Syakhl (Холат-Сяхыл, a Mansi name, meaning Dead Mountain). The mountain pass where the incident occurred has since been named "Dyatlov Pass" (Перевал Дятлова) after the group's leader, Igor Dyatlov (Игорь Дятлов). To this day, the incident has not been solved.
A group was formed for a ski trek across the northern Urals in Sverdlovsk Oblast. The group, led by Igor Dyatlov, consisted of eight men and two women. Most were students or graduates of "Ural Polytechnical Institute" (Уральский Политехнический Институт, УПИ), now Ural Federal University:
It is not known what happened to the hikers. The most likely thing is that an avalanche hit them, and some of them struggled on until they died of cold and exposure. Only one hiker who left the group before the event happened survived. Six of the group members died of hypothermia and three of fatal injuries.
There are many conspiracy theories towards what killed the hikers. Many Russians believe that a local tribe called the Mansi people killed them for trespassing on their property. Others believe that the military had something to do with their death. High levels of radiation was found on their clothing so some believe that a missile misfired and crashed nearby the hikers.
Investigators at the time discovered that the hikers tore open their tent from inside, ran barefoot into heavy snow and a temperature of . Although the corpses showed no signs of struggle, two victims had fractured skulls, two had broken ribs, and one was missing parts of her face such as her tongue.

Scopes trial

The Scopes trial is formally known as "The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes". It is also referred to as the Scopes monkey trial. 
It was a famous American legal case in 1925. A substitute high school teacher, John Scopes, was accused of violating Tennessee's Butler Act. This Act made it unlawful to teach human evolution in any state-funded school. The trial was deliberately staged in order to attract publicity to the small town of Dayton, Tennessee, where it was held. 
Scopes was unsure whether he had ever actually taught evolution, but he purposely incriminated himself so that the case could have a defendant. 
Scopes was found guilty and fined $100, but the verdict was overturned on a technicality. The trial served its purpose of drawing intense national publicity. National reporters came to Dayton to cover the big-name lawyers who had agreed to represent each side. William Jennings Bryan, three-time presidential candidate, argued for the prosecution, while Clarence Darrow, the famed defense attorney, spoke for Scopes. 
The trial publicized the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy. This set "Modernists", who said evolution was not inconsistent with religion, against Fundamentalists, who said the word of God as revealed in the Bible took priority over all human knowledge. The case was thus seen as both a theological contest and a trial on whether modern evolutionary biology should be taught in schools.
The Tennessee law was not repealed until 1967.

Leopold and Loeb

Leopold and Loeb were Nathan Freudenthal Leopold, Jr. (November 19, 1904 – August 29, 1971) and Richard Albert Loeb (June 11, 1905 – January 28, 1936).
They were two wealthy University of Chicago law students who kidnapped and murdered 14-year-old Robert "Bobby" Franks in 1924 in Chicago.
The duo was motivated to murder Franks by their desire to commit a perfect crime.
Once arrested, Leopold and Loeb hired Clarence Darrow as counsel for the defense. Darrow’s summation in their trial criticized capital punishment as retribution, rather than rehabilitation. Leopold and Loeb were sentenced to life imprisonment. Loeb was killed by a fellow prisoner in 1936; Leopold was released on parole in 1958.
The Leopold and Loeb crime has been the inspiration for several works in film, theatre, and fiction, such as the 1929 play "Rope" by Patrick Hamilton, and Alfred Hitchcock's take on the play in the 1948 film of the same name. Later movies such as "Compulsion" and "Swoon" were more accurate portrayals of the Leopold and Loeb case.

Fluvial terrace

Fluvial terrace is an abandoned floodplain with a long, narrow stairs that is formed when the river flowed at a higher level than at present. Fluvial terrace consists of two parts; a tread, which is the flat surface at the upper side of fluvial terrace, and a scarp, which is the steep slope connecting the tread to the downside. Fluvial terrace is divided into Rock terrace and Gravel terrace according to structure materials, and it is also classified as Tectonic terrace and Climate terrace according to causes of formation.
Fluvial terraces are either called erosional or depositional.
Erosional terrace is a terrace that the tread has been formed primarily by lateral erosion. During low water level stage, fine sediment is deposited and during normal flow, coarse sediment is deposited at the end of a high water event. When the river reaches its highest level, it entrains all the channel sediment and scours the underlying bedrock before coarse detritus is deposited again on the channel floor.
Depositional terrace is a terrace that the tread represents the surface of a valley fill. Valley filling occurs when the amount of sediment produced in a basin exceeds the amount that the river system can carry away. It is usually triggered by glacial outwash, climate change, or change in base level, slope, or load caused by rising water level. Depositional terrace is climatically controlled, whereas erosional terrace is tectonically controlled.

Gracie Gold (born August 17, 1995) is an American figure skater.
Gracie Gold was born on August 17, 1995 in Newton, Massachusetts. When she was four years old her family moved to Springfield, Illinois. At a skating birthday party when she was eight years old, she began to try figure skating. After that party she signed up for lessons. She was a natural; she soon was landing double axels. 
After awhile her hard work wasn't paying off. She kept getting low scores! Around a year before the Sochi, Olympics Gracie's relationship with her coach, Alex Ouriashev had completely crumbled. A little while after that Gracie switched coaches. She switched to Frank Carroll and this switch took her mother and sister Carly Gold with her to Hermosa Beach, Los Angeles. Frank Carroll’s experience with coaching other Olympians like Evan Lysacek, Michelle Kwan, Tim Goebel, Linda Fratianne and Denis Ten helped and inspired Gracie. Going to the Olympics gave a lot of stress to her. She would stress about being an Olympian and would stress out about all of the mistakes she would make in practice. Sometimes to calm down Gracie would juggle. She had to learn how to relax while doing her triple axels and how to save a jump if she started off wrong. Gracie also had to learn how to make her performance still look good to the judges, even after a fall. Later, after all of this training Gracie was ready to compete in competitions like the Midwestern sectional, The U.S. Championships, and the U.S. International Classic. In almost all of her later competitions she did better than the firsts. This helped her earn her spot in the 2014 Sochi, Olympics. 
Gracie got a bronze medal from the Olympics, she got this from the team event. In the Ladies free skate, and short program she was placed fourth. Gracie is eager to return to Olympic Ice in the 2018 Winter Olympics.

Gayageum

The gayageum or kayagum is a traditional Korean zither-like string instrument. It has 12 strings, though some more recent variants have 21 or other numbers of strings. It is probably the best known traditional Korean musical instrument. Its body is made of Paulownia wood.
According to Samguksagi ( the three kingdoms history book), the first gayageum was made for King Gasil in the 6th century. This was after he observed a Chinese musical instrument. He ordered a musician named Wu Ruk to compose music for this new instrument. The original name was "gayago". It was further improved by Wu Ruk.
There are two types. The "beobgeum gayageum" is 160cm long by 30cm wide by 10cm deep. Its body is made of a single piece of paulownia wood. The resonator chamber is hollowed out of the wood body. It is used in court music.
The "sanjo gayageum" is about 142cm long by 23cm wide by 10cm deep. The soundboard is made of paulownia, but the sides and back are of a harder wood such as chestnut or walnut. It is used in folk music.
The player usually sits cross-legged. The gayageum is played put on the player’s knee (usually the right knee). One hand plucks the strings to make a sound. The other hand decorates the sound by pressing, shaking, and vibrating the strings.

<doc id="453519" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=453519" title="Legal guardian">
Legal guardian

The goal of a legal guardian is to protect a person who cannot make legal decisions on their own. The legal guardian makes decisions for the person who needs protection. Usually, a legal guardian has to be appointed (chosen) by a court. Before a court appoints a guardian for a person, it first has to decide that the person is incompetent (unable to make decisions on their own).
A court may choose a legal guardian for a minor child (a child under a certain age) in many different situations:
A court may also choose a legal guardian for an adult. This happens when the court decides the adult is incompetent. The court appoints a legal guardian to help protect the incompetent person (who is called a ward). The legal guardian then has the right to make legal decisions for the ward.
Legal guardians get chosen in a few different ways.
Sometimes a parent will write a will, which explains their last wishes in case they die. In the will, they can say who they want to take care of their child if the parent dies. If the parent dies, a court still has to approve the person named in the will as the child's new guardian. The new guardian does not have to be a blood relative of the parent or child.
If someone (like a person's doctor, psychiatrist, or family member) thinks that a person is incompetent, they may ask a court to choose a legal guardian. In the United States, the court must hold a hearing to decide whether the person needs a guardian. The person must be given a lawyer, and the court must listen to arguments from both sides. If the court decides that the person needs a guardian, the court will choose one. That guardian may be a family member, a friend, or a stranger.
In the United States, when a court chooses a legal guardian, the court has to say specifically what decisions the guardian will be able to make for their ward. For example, a court might say the guardian can only make medical decisions for their ward. The ward will still have the right to make any other decisions that are not medical decisions.
Different states have different laws about types of guardianships and what decisions guardians can make.
For example, in Massachusetts, a court can appoint a Rogers Guardian, who can only make decisions about their ward's psychiatric (mental health) medicines. The ward still has the right to make any other decisions that are not about medications.
In other states, like Pennsylvania, a court can appoint a plenary guardian, who has the right to make all decisions for the ward. The ward has no right to make any important decisions for himself or herself.

Complex Party Come Theories is their first work. After that, they got new guitarist Jim Fairchild and keyboardist Tim Dryden. They released EP A Pretty Mess By This One Band in 1996, and their first full-length album Under The Western Freeway in 1997. “Summer Here Kids”, one of the songs in Under The Western Freeway, earned Single of the Week honors in NME. In 2000, in Sophftware Slump, they created vintage, electronic, drift-off music. In , Concrete Dunes was released, without the band's permission. In 2003, the group released another album, Sumday, and received good reviews. In 2006, Just Like the Fambly Cat was released. 
After the album, the band broke up in 2005. They did not do Just Like the Fambly Cat tour concert. The band was utterly content and happy about the decision to end Grandaddy. In the song 'Elevate Myself', he says "I don't wanna work all night and day. On writing songs that make the young girls cry." Other members all worked in their own field, but Jim Fairchild was still working with music. He joined a guitarist in Modest Mouse tour, and he released his first solo album, Ten Readings of a Warning. In 2012, the band reunited for Outside Lands Festival in San Francisco. In the same year, they played in End of the Road Festival. No album has been released since then. 
In an interview, Jason Lytle tell why the band name got their name Grandaddy; They realized that they are too ugly to seduce young women, so they try to appeal to old women, just like Morrissey. Birds frequently appear in their album cover, because birds are beautiful and colorful, and they can sing.
Grandaddy's music has features in the late 90s lo-fi indie rock. Their music has the catchy melodies that they are able to create with the synths and distorted guitars. Most of their musics are slow and emotional. Also, they used electronics. Their lyrics are mostly vague and abstract, but inventive. The album's most enduring image is a man sipping a beer and strumming an acoustic guitar in quiet, beautiful countryside. The Sophtware Slump is generally regarded as the band's masterpiece, but other albums like Under the Western Freeway are popular, too.

The Aztecs believed the universe went through four phases. They called them suns. They believed that they lived in the fifth sun. The gods ended each sun with a huge tragedy and then created a new world. In the first sun, the world was destroyed by jaguars. In the second, the world was destroyed by a storm. In the third sun, the earth was destroyed by a fire rain. At the end of the fourth, the world was destroyed by a huge flood. They believed that the fifth sun would end with a huge earthquake.
In their religion they worshipped many gods and goddesses. They even made human sacrifices. There were three parts of the body that they considered the most powerful: the head, the heart, and the liver. 
Some gods and goddesses in Aztec mythology are Huitzilopochtli, Tezcatlipoca, and Xochiquetzal.

R/K selection theory

r/K selection theory describes the way a species controls its number of offspring. 
r-selection species produce many offspring. K-selected species focus on a few. Neither method is in itself superior, and they may occur in the same habitat; e.g., rodents (r-selection) and elephants (K-selection). 
The theory was popular in the 1970s and 1980s, but several studies criticized it. The study of life histories has replaced the r/K selection paradigm.
The terminology of r/K-selection was coined by the ecologists Robert MacArthur and E.O. Wilson, based on their work on island biogeography. Study of the evolution of life history strategies actually has a longer history.

Instead of putting all this money to create arms, I think countries should invest in scholarships for kids to study abroad [in other countries]. Perhaps they could become good and knowledgeable professors in their own countries. You need time for that kind of change, though."

Oppositional defiant disorder

Oppositional defiant disorder is a mental disorder. It is a pattern of irritable or angry behavior lasting at least 6 months and is seen during interaction with other people. Unlike those with conduct disorder, though, most people with ODD do not usually get aggressive towards other people or animals, steal or cause destruction. People with ODD, however, do argue and deliberately, often cause trouble.
In order to be diagnosed with ODD, the person must have a behavior pattern lasting at least six months. At least four of these eight symptoms must be present for that time:
About 10.2% of people have or have had ODD (11.2% of males and 9.2% of females). In many cases this condition worsens into conduct disorder, which often worsens into antisocial personality disorder. This is more likely in boys than girls, and more likely if the person also has attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. ODD typically begins in childhood. It is the most common mental disorder in children. It is unusual in adults, because the affected person usually either recovers or develops ASPD. 
ODD is more common in family members of people who have ODD, CD or ASPD. It is more common in poor urban areas. 
Most people who have ODD also have other mental disorders, most often ADHD. Many children who have ODD have problems with alcohol and drugs in their adolescence and adulthood.

Plitt Theatres

Plitt Theaters was a major movie theater chain in the United States. It was originally the theater division of Paramount Pictures. This included a number of theater circuits acquired by Paramount, notably Balaban and Katz. In the late 1930s the United States government filed an antitrust lawsuit against five Movie studios. As a result Paramount was required to split off their theater chain. 
On December 31, 1949, the theater business was spun off into an independent company called United Paramount Theaters (UPT). It was headed by Leonard Goldenson. In 1953 UPT purchased the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). This provided ABC's television network with a source of cash flow that allowed it to survive and eventually become competitive. The new company was named American Broadcasting-Paramount Theaters. In 1965 the corporation was renamed American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. The theater chain was renamed ABC Theaters. In 1974 ABC sold its movie theaters in the Midwest (a division called ABC Great States) to one of its executives, Henry Plitt, doing business as Plitt Theaters. Plitt subsequently bought the ABC Southern theater operations in 1978. In 1985, Plitt Theaters was sold to Cineplex Odeon Corporation.

The Hunger Games trilogy

The Hunger Games is a trilogy of books by Suzanne Collins which tells the story of Katniss Everdeen (16) in these games. In the first book, Katniss replaces her sister Primrose Everdeen (12) in the hunger games because Prim is very weak and fragile. The hunger games are a competition of the nation of Panem (the present day United States), which is divided in 12 Districts. In these games 12 boys and 12 girls between 12 and 18 years old learn the rules of survival and fight one another to the death until only one survives. The boys and girls are named tributes and represent their Districts. A menace of the games are the Muts. The Muts are mutant wolves. The origin of the competition was the Nuclear War of the Dark Years, when the districts rebelled against the Capitol. The Districts lost the war and the Capitol won. The champion of the games lives in a special village in their districts and they are given money and jewellery and their family will not be elected for the games again.
The life in the Districts is very different from the life in the capitol. In the Capitol the people do not work and they are rich. In the districts the people work very hard and they are not rich except in districts 1, 2 and 4. 
In the 74th hunger games Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark (16) participate and win because the rest of the tributes have died and both menace to eat nightlocks, a poisonous berry which kills in a moment. Snow, Panem’s president, doesn’t like it because he needs a Champion so that the people in Capitol and the Districts won’t rebel. The principal tributes are Marvel (killed by Katniss) and Glimer (killed by Katniss) (district 1), Cato (killed by Katniss) and Clove (killed by Tresh) (district 2), Foxface (killed by the nightlocks) (district 5) and Tresh (killed by the muts) and Rue (killed by Marvel) (district 11). In the end of the book, Katniss and Peeta return to district 12 and Seneca Crane, the guard of the games, is killed by president Snow with nightlocks.

The local Greeks wanted to join Greece. The Turkish nationalists were opposed to join Greece and fought against the Greek troops in the surrounding of the town. Then the Greek army decided to retreat in June 1921. The local Christians also fled with the Greek army and lost their non movable property. Before the Greeks left they looted the Turks, partly burned the town, burned some surrounding villages and desecrated the mosques of Izmit. On 24 June they killed more than 300 people in the cemetery. Thousands of Turks hid in the French college to find safety. Izmit was occupied by the Turkish army on 28 June 1921. Most of the Christians never returned back to the town.

101st Airborne Division

The 101st Airborne Division is an infantry division in the United States Army. It was called an "airborne" division because, as a paratrooper unit, it used airplanes to go into battle. It is most famous its defense of Bastogne at the Battle of the Bulge. The division later fought in the Vietnam War, including the Battle of Hamburger Hill. It also fought in the Gulf War, War in Afghanistan, and War in Iraq.
The 101st Division was organized 2 November 1918 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi. World War I ended 9 days later. The unit was disbanded on 11 December 1918.
The unit was made active again on 10 September 1921, at Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They were assigned to the United States Army Reserve. At this time the "Screaming Eagle" nickname became associated with the division. They assumed several traditions as a successor to the volunteer regiments of the American Civil War. In order to reorganize the 101st as an airborne division in the (regular) U.S. Army, the reserve division was disbanded on 15 August 1942.
The 101st Airborne Division was activated in the U.S. Army on 16 August 1942. This was at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana. On 19 August 1942, its first commander, Major General William C. Lee, promised his new recruits that the 101st had "no history but had a rendezvous with destiny." On D-Day (6 June 1944) the 101st Airborne Division parachuted behind the enemy lines in back of Utah Beach. They cleared a path for the beach landings and captured several key objectives. The division took part in Operation Market Garden (17–25 September 1944). This was the largest airborne operation of all time.

Interlanguage fossilization

In 1972, Selinker showed the concept of "Interlanguage fossilization." Interlangauge means a language learning stage before achieving the new language. Sometimes it is defined as an imperfect language. Fossilization means a condition where nothing can be changed. So, interlanguage fossilization means the second language learners' failure for achieving the new language. Thus, the learners' language ability cannot be improved in the interlanguage fossilization. 
There are two reasons why the interlanguage fossilization happens.
Interlanguage fossilization occurs in adults learning a new language. In language learning, unlike the child, adults can't ignore about language rules and grammar. When adults study a new language, they always check the language rules or grammar. This can make learning a language much harder. In addition, adults are more likely to be influenced by their native language. In other words, the native language interferences hold adults back from improving language proficiency. Therefore, there are many adults language learners who experience the interlanguage fossilization.
"Acceptance" of a new culture can also cause interlanguage fossilization. If the learners are in new country, then they have to learn a new language. When the learners are in new cultures, they try to make it suitable themselves to new circumstances. At first, they feel nervous because there are big cultural differences. Therefore, the learners study hard. However, after time goes by, people stop studying a new language because they cannot feel nervous anymore. The learner think that they are fully adapted in the new culture and they are confident with their new language proficiency. Then, interlanguage fossilization happens.

Portmeirion

Portmeirion is a tourist village in Gwynedd, North Wales. The village is in the community of Penrhyndeudraeth. Its is next to the River Dwyryd. It was created and built by Clough Williams-Ellis. He created and built it between the years 1925 and 1975. He wanted it to look like an Italian village. A charity owns it. Many movies and television shows were filmed there, including "The Prisoner".
Portmeirion looks a lot like the Italian city of Portofino. But, Clough Williams-Ellis, who created Portmeirion, always said that it was "not" based on the city of Portofino. He said he did want it to look like it was a place near the Mediterranean, though. He designed and built the village between the years of 1925 and 1975. The mix of architecture in the village is believed to have influenced postmodernism architecture in the late 1900s.
An old estate used to be located on the property before Portmeirion was built. It was called "Aber Iâ" (). The hotel and three cottages, which are named "White Horses", "Mermaid", and "The Salutation", are part of the original estate. It was built in the 1850s. Before the estate, there was a foundry and a boatyard on site. There is also an old site which has a small group of remains from a mediaeval castle nearby. 
In 1931, Williams-Ellis bought a Victorian mansion from his uncle Sir Osmund Williams, Bt. It was called Castell Deudraeth. Williams-Ellis planned on having the mansion be a part of the hotel. Lots of problems and the war did not allow that to happen. Williams-Ellis loved the building a lot and did anything he could to make it a part of the hotel. He received money from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, and Wales Tourist Board. This money allowed him to finally open Castell Deudraeth as a hotel with 11 bedrooms and a restaurant on August 20, 2001. Bryn Terfel performed at the opening. 
There are a lot of rhododendrons at Portmeirion, which are part of gardens that go throughout the land. The gardens were started before Williams-Ellis lived there. They were started by George Henry Caton Haigh. An English charity owns Portmeirion, today. It is still a hotel. There is also a cafe, cottages for rent, shops, a tearoom, and a restaurant. 
Lewis Mumford has written a lot about Portmeirion. He wrote a lot about it in his book, "The Highway and the City" in 1964.
A lot of people have found inspiration in Portmeirion. Noël Coward wrote the play "Blithe Spirit" while staying in a cottage at Portmeirion. Frank Lloyd Wright, Gregory Peck, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul McCartney have visited. Jools Holland visited it while he was making a TV show called "The Tube". He loved Portmeirion so much that he used its type of architecture in building his recording studio and house in Blackheath. 
The village is used in many movies and television shows to look like the shows are taking place in an exotic place in Europe. Episodes of "Danger Man", "Doctor Who", and "The Prisoner" have been filmed at Portmeirion. Many bands and musicians have recorded videos, songs, and held concerts there to do with "The Prisoner", including Supergrass, Iron Maiden, XTC, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and a music festival called Festival N°6.

Sirius Passet is a special fossil site, a lagerstätte in Greenland. It is from six places on the eastern shore of a fjord in the far north of Greenland. It was discovered in 1984. About 10,000 fossil specimens have been collected so far.
The fauna is just before that of the Burgess Shale, probably ten to fifteen million years older – 518 vs. 505 mya. 
The fauna includes some arthropods and sponges, and rare representatives of other groups. A polychaete annelid from the Sirius Passet was described in 2008. Polychaete annelids are a significant part of the Burgess Shale fauna, but are otherwise unknown from the other early Cambrian lagerstätten. This single species from a single place improves our knowledge of this group.

Menai Suspension Bridge

The Menai Suspension Bridge () is a suspension bridge in Wales. It runs from the island of Anglesey to Holyhead. It was designed by Thomas Telford. They started building it in 1819 and it was finished in 1826.
Before the bridge was built, the only way people could get to Anglesey island was by a ferry from Holyhead. The water of the Menai Strait is very rough and dangerous, so it was hard for people to use their own boats or swim to the island. The people who lived on Anglesey sold cattle that they raised. The cattle were forced to swim through the dangerous water, with many of them often dying. If the cows survived the trip, they were sent to London and other places to be sold. 
An engineer named Thomas Telford was working near Holyhead when he thought it would be a good idea to build a suspension bridge to Anglesey. A suspension bridge was big enough that tall ships could go underneath them. He asked the British Parliament if he could build the bridge and they said yes.
Telford designed the bridge. They started building it in 1819. The first thing to be built were the towers that are on both sides at Holyhead and Anglesey. The towers were made out of limestone from Penmon. They were hollow inside. After the towers were built, 16 chains were installed. They were made out of 935 bars of iron. They were long enough to support the long bridge. Iron can rust. So, the people who made the chains soaked them in linseed oil and the painted. The chains were long and weighed 121 tons. The bridge opened on January 30, 1826.
The road that went over the bridge was not very safe because of the strong winds. Workers made the bridge stronger in 1840. The bridge road was made of wood, and in 1893 it was replaced with steel. The bridge only allowed cars and trucks that weighted up to 4.5 tons to go over the bridge. This made it hard for big trucks to bring goods to the island. In 1938 they installed wrought iron chains to make the bridge strong. In 1999, the bridge closed for one month. The road was fixed and the bridge was made stronger. When it was closed, people had to drive over the Britannia Bridge to get to the island. 
One part of the bridge was closed for six months starting on February 28, 2005. The bridge was painted for the first time in 65 years. It was reopened on December 11.
The Anglesey Coastal Path goes under the bridge. There is a memorial to the Aberfan disaster victims at the bridge on Anglesey.
The closest town to the bridge is called Menai Bridge. British one pound coins have drawings of the bridge. The coins were made in 2005. The bridge is mentioned in "Through the Looking-Glass" by Lewis Carroll.

D (programming language)

The D programming language is an object-oriented, imperative, multi-paradigm system programming language. D language originated as a re-engineering of C++, and D's design goals try combining the performance of compiled languages with the safety and expressive power of modern dynamic languages. Native D code is commonly as fast as equivalent C++ code, while being shorter and memory-safe.
This example program prints its command line arguments. The codice_1 function is the entry point of a D program, and codice_2 is an array of strings representing the command line arguments. A codice_3 in D is an array of characters, represented by codice_4 in D1, or codice_5 in D2.
import std.stdio: writefln;
void main(string[] args)
The codice_6 statement can iterate over any collection. In this case, it is producing a sequence of indexes (codice_7) and values (codice_8) from the array codice_2. The index codice_7 and the value codice_8 have their types inferred from the type of the array codice_2.
The following shows several D capabilities and D design trade-offs in a very short program. It iterates the lines of a text file named codice_13 that contains a different word on each line, and prints all the words that are anagrams of other words.
import std.stdio, std.algorithm, std.range, std.string;

A transatlantic telegraph cable is a cable running under the Atlantic Ocean. It was used for telegraph communications.

Tribune of the plebs

Tribunes of the plebs were important officials in Ancient Rome. The plebians (plebs) were the free Roman people who were not patricians.
The tribunes provided a balance between the power of the Senate and the needs of the people. There were ten tribunes at any time, and they could act separately or together. 
These tribunes had the power to use the People's Assembly (the Concilium Plebis) to support the common people. They could summon the Senate, propose legislation and intervene on the behalf of plebeians in legal matters. Most important of all was the power to veto the actions of the Consuls and other magistrates, to protect the interests of the plebeians. An assault on any plebian tribune was against the law.
Tribunes of the plebs were elected by the People's Assembly alone. They could be commoners, unlike all the other officials of the Roman Republic. Their role lasted for about 800 years, but under the Roman Empire they did not have real powers. They were in origin and style, a working part of the Roman Republic. 
Although a tribune could veto any action of the magistrates, Senate, or other assemblies, he had to be physically present in order to do so. Once the tribune was no longer present, the action could be completed as if the veto had not occurred. This meant that the tribunes' powers were limited to Rome itself, not the Republic in general.

Meju

Meju is a brick of fermented soybeans in Korean cuisine. It is used in Korean cuisine to make essential condiments such as soy sauce (kanjang), soybean paste (doenjang) and red chilli pepper paste (gochujang). Meju is produced by drying a brick of soybeans. The brick of soybeans is naturally fermented while it dries. There are several ways to make a brick of soybeans. Traditionally, boiled soybeans were crushed in a mortar and made into a brick shape to be tied up with straw.
"Meju" was commonly made in any Korean home in the past. Condiments made with mejus all tasted different because the production of meju was not standardized. As many Koreans now buy Korean traditional condiments instead of making them, it is difficult to find the wide variety of unique tasting condiments made from homemade meju.
The meaning of the word ‘meju’ originally included all condiments and seasonings made with meju. However, as another word ‘jang’ was used more frequently to refer to condiments made with meju, the meaning of the word ‘meju’ shifted to refer only to the stage before it is used in condiments. Scholars believe the Japanese word ‘miso’ which is similar to Korean doenjang has the same origin as ‘meju’.

Seal of Mississippi

The Mississippi State Seal was adopted in 1798, back when Mississippi was a U.S. territory, the Mississippi territory. When it became a state in 1817, it was declared the state seal.
The central part of the seal has an eagle centered inside it. The wings of the eagle are spread out, and its head held high. Stars and stripes adorn its chest. The outer circle of this seal carries the words "The Great Seal of the State of Mississippi".
This seal was adopted on 19 January 1818. In July of 2014, the seal was slightly changed when the state government added the words "In God We Trust" to the bottom. The state government said that it did this to protect "religious freedom".

Limit of a sequence

In mathematics, a sequence is an ordered list of events. Each event consists of a mathematical object, which is a number in many cases. In some cases, the sequence tends towards a limit. In this case, the sequence is said to be convergent, otherwise it is divergent.
In a convergent sequence, the absolute difference between the value of the current element and the limit, formula_1 will decrease as the sequence progresses. 
We call formula_2 the limit of the sequence formula_3 if the following condition holds:
In other words, for every measure of closeness formula_8, the sequence's terms are eventually that close to the limit. The sequence formula_3 is said to converge to or tend to the limit formula_2, written formula_11 or formula_12.
If a sequence converges to some limit, then it is convergent; otherwise it is divergent.
The Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea is famous for formulating paradoxes that involve limiting processes.
Leucippus, Democritus, Antiphon, Eudoxus and Archimedes developed the method of exhaustion, which uses an infinite sequence of approximations to determine an area or a volume. Archimedes succeeded in summing what is now called a geometric series.
Newton dealt with series in his works on "Analysis with infinite series" (written in 1669, circulated in manuscript, published in 1711), "Method of fluxions and infinite series" (written in 1671, published in English translation in 1736, Latin original published much later) and "Tractatus de Quadratura Curvarum" (written in 1693, published in 1704 as an Appendix to his "Optiks"). In the latter work, Newton considers the binomial expansion of ("x"+"o") which he then linearizes by "taking limits" (letting "o"→0).
In the 18th century, mathematicians like Euler succeeded in summing some "divergent" series by stopping at the right moment; they did not much care whether a limit existed, as long as it could be calculated. At the end of the century, Lagrange in his "Théorie des fonctions analytiques" (1797) opined that the lack of rigour precluded further development in calculus. Gauss in his etude of hypergeometric series (1813) for the first time rigorously investigated under which conditions a series converged to a limit.
The modern definition of a limit (for any ε there exists an index "N" so that ...) was given by Bernhard Bolzano ("Der binomische Lehrsatz", Prague 1816, little noticed at the time) and by Karl Weierstraß in the 1870s.

Random walk hypothesis

Random walk hypothesis is created as a neo-classical consumption function by Robert E. Hall, and it is related to an expectation theory in macro economics. This gives basis of how individuals do economic decision of present period and is used to calculate an amount of the macro consumption from an economic world.
This theory starts with Freidman's permanent income hypothesis and Lucas's rational expectation hypothesis. Before this theory was made, other expectation theories basically assume that people irrationally think sometimes making decision based on the past (already reflected in the market) facts or falling into the illusion. But Lucas argued that the market players use all the information available at the moment in order to pursuit utility maximization. Permanent income hypothesis supposes people try to decide the amount of consumption expecting the impacts of a certain incident throughout the whole periods of time.
Random walk hypothesis concludes rational expectation to consumption of the next period is the present consumption. It is because all the information was taken into account on the decision of the present consumption. What changes the amount of next period consumption is totally unexpected or not given information. Therefore, the changes in the consumption cannot be expected but randomly walk.

Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant

Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), or Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), or Islamic State, (IS) is a Sunni jihadist militant group. In Arabic it is often called "Daesh". It operates in Libya, Nigeria, Iraq, and Syria. It is influenced by the Wahhabi version of Islam. It claims the status of independent state for the territories under its control in Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, and Syria. It is opposed to Shiism and has been described as "Shiaphobic". 
The group was started in the early years of the Iraq War and associated itself with Al-Qaeda in 2004. ISIL was composed of different insurgent groups. Its aim was to establish a caliphate in the Sunni majority regions of Iraq, later expanding this to include Syria. In February 2014, after an eight-month power struggle, Al-Qaeda cut all ties with ISIL.
ISIL is millenarianist, meaning it believes that society is going to change a lot over the course of 1,000 years.
At the height of the Iraq War, ISIL was in the Iraqi provinces of Al Anbar, Ninawa, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad. It claimed Baqubah as its capital. In the ongoing Syrian Civil War, the group has a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqa, Idlib and Aleppo.
The group has attacked government and military targets. It has claimed responsibility for attacks that killed thousands of Iraqi civilians. During the time coalition forces were present in Iraq, the group suffered some setbacks. By 2012, it was thought to have regained most of its strength and more than doubled the number of its members to about 2,500.
In 2013, a letter and an audio recording of Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaeda, was leaked to Al Jazeera. In it, al-Zawahiri disbanded the Syrian faction of ISIL. The group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, opposed this ruling on the basis of Islamic law. The group has since continued to operate in Syria. Starting in April 2013, it made rapid military gains in large parts of Northern Syria, where the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights described them as "the strongest group". They have sought publicity by releasing videos of the decapitation (beheading) of journalists and other prisoners of war mainly done by member Jihadi John. "Jihadi John" was killed in a U.S. drone strike in November 2015.
In June 2014, it announced a worldwide caliphate. In 2014, ISIL successfully fought in a large-scale offensive in Iraq. After this offensive, ISIL is reported to have seized control of most of Mosul, the second biggest city in Iraq, its surrounding Nineveh province, and the city of Fallujah. In the spring of 2015 ISIL fought for control of Tikrit, the administrative center of the Salah ad Din Governorate. In spring of 2016 the Army of Iraq took back Fallujah.
The 2014 film "The Blue Man", which is related to The New York Times article titled "Uncovering Iraq's Horrors in Desert Graves" written by John F. Burns, also mentions mass killings of Shia Muslims by the Islamic State between 2003 to 2006.

The Orpheum is a theatre and music venue. It is located on 884 Granville Street in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Orpheum is a part of the Vancouver Civic Theatres group of live performance venues along with the Queen Elizabeth Theatre and Vancouver Playhouse. It was opened on November 7, 1927 as a vaudeville house although they had their first show the day before. When it opened in 1927, The Orpheum was the biggest theatre in Canada, had three thousand seats and cost $1.25 million to build. When vaudeville was slowing down from its popularity, the Orpheum found new owners in Famous Players and became mainly a movie house but hosted live events every now and then.
In 1973, Famous Players wanted to turn the place into a multiplex because of economic reasons. There was a "Save the Orpheum" public protest that was launched, which Jack Benny flew in to help with. The Orpheum was then saved.
It is the home of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. The Orpheum was designated a National Historic Site of Canada on November 15, 1979.

Multiroom

Multiroom, also known as "multi bang" in Korea, is a place that people go to do various activities such as, singing, watching movies, playing Nintendo or Wii games, and etc. It is called multiroom because you can rent a small room with many electronic devices by the hour. The price of a multiroom is usually between 10,000-15,000 won per hour. The room usually comes with unlimited snack and beverage refills. The snacks include pretzels, toast, ice cream, cereal and the beverages include coffee, soda, tea, and etc. Customers are allowed to bring the snacks into their cozy, small rooms and enjoy while singing or gaming. It is a trend in Korea for teenagers to go to multibangs or multirooms. This is because of the reasonable prices and it comes with many activities. Compared to going to noraebang, theaters or game rooms individually, multiroom is much more cheaper and reasonable. So for broke teenagers, it is a very attractive place to hang out. Multirooms are also an attractive place for adults to spend their time.

Toussaint L'ouverture

Toussaint L'Ouverture (c. 1743–1803), He was the leader of the Haitian Revolution. Toussaint L’Ouverture started his military career as a leader of the 1791 slave rebellion in Saint-Domingue, which was a French colony. When he did this he was a free black man (not a slave). Toussaint gradually took control over the whole island (also the Spanish part called Santo Domingo). When he had power for years, he tried to improve the security and economy on Saint-Domingue. He also restored the plantation system, by using paid workers. Besides of all this, he had a very large army.
Little is known for sure about Toussaint L’Ouverture’s early life, because sources disagree. The first records of his life were from his son, Isaac L’Ouverture. Most histories say Toussaint’s father was Gaou Guinou, who was a son of King Arrada. King Arrada, also called Great Arrada, was the king of what is now Benin. His mother was Gaou Guinou’s second wife.
Most sources tell us that Toussaint L’Ouverture was born on the plantation of Bréda at Haute de Cap in Saint Domingue. His birthdate is unknown. All Saints' Day is likely, because his name "Toussaint" means "all saints'" in French. When the Haitian Revolution started he was probably about 50 years old. Different sources give birth dates from 1739 until 1746. When he was a child he was small and weak. But as an adult he was known by his great stamina and horse-riding skills.
Most sources tell us that Toussaint was well-educated by his godfather, Pierre Baptiste. By age 20 he could speak three languages, French, Creole and some Latin. He also had a knowledge of medicinal plants.
Toussaint married Suzanne Simone Baptiste in 1782. Suzanne was probably his cousin. People think that he had 16 children, and that 11 of them had already died before he did himself. His oldest son was adopted. The two sons born out of his marriage with Suzanne were Isaac and Saint-Jean.
Toussaint was known for being a slave until the start of the Revolution. He was free at the age of 33.
When he was free, he became wealthier and began to have more property. He made a good amount of money in the Revolution and he was the owner of several properties.
During his life Toussaint L’Ouverture was considered to be a Roman Catholic. The Vodou spirituality was also often used on the Bréda plantation. It was combined with Catholicism. It is not known if Toussaint had anything to do with these religions and spiritualties. When he was the ruler of Saint-Domingue, he said he did not.
L'ouverture was a Freemason. The historians thought this, because he used a Masonic symbol in his signature.
Saint-Domingue (later Haiti) was the world's biggest sugar producer and provided sugar for many countries. It had more than 800 sugar plantations. With a few rich families and 500,000 African slaves on Haiti, the slaves totally outnumbered everyone else. To stop the slaves from revolting and taking the power, the French people used terrible methods to keep the slaves powerless.
The Haitian Revolution began when the French people who owned the plantations wanted independence. But the slaves wanted something else; they wanted freedom. In 1791, about 100,00 slaves revolted. They burned all the sugarcane in the fields and killed hundreds of slave owners. In this early stage, Toussaint L’Ouverture did not join yet. But after some weeks, he took his family to the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo to keep them safe and helped the supervisors of the plantation of Bréda to leave the island, if we believe surviving documents.
Toussaint L’Ouverture was one of the leaders of the rebellion. He took part in talks about strategy. He had contact with the Spanish people who supported the rebellion, because they provided food to the slaves who were in revolt. In 1801 he moved to Santo Domingo and took control of the territory. He freed the slaves and wrote a constitution for Santo Domingo.
When Napoleon Bonaparte took power in France, he took back the rich sugar plantations on Saint-Domingue. In January of the year 1802, French soldiers landed in Saint-Domingue in order to get rid of Toussaint L’Ouverture. When Napoleon Bonaparte told Toussaint that he wanted Saint-Domingue back, Toussaint said that he would get it back if he would end slavery on Saint-Domingue forever. Napoleon agreed and took Toussaint with him to Paris to discuss the deal further.
Despite the deal, the French people later accused L'Ouverture of planning another revolt against the plantation owners. He was sent to jail in the French Alps. The jail was called Fort-de-Joux. Ten months after he was sent to jail, on the 7th of April 1803, Toussaint died.
After his death, slavery in Haiti was started again, but was never to be the same. Toussaint had left an impression about slavery, and the slaves continued to fight the rich French plantation owners in a brutal way. This resulted in another revolution. Toussaint’s General, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, took up Toussaint's job in the revolution after he died. Dessalines became the first Emperor of Haiti. Later in the revolt he was attacked and he died.
But before Dessalines died, yellow fever killed thousands of French people trying to calm the revolt in Haiti. On January 1, 1804, Saint-Domingue was renamed Haiti and was declared independent by Dessalines. In this way, Haiti became the first black republic in the world, and the first colony to free itself from European rule.

Mary Sheldon Barnes

Mary Downing Sheldon (born September 15, 1850-died August 27, 1898) was a historian and teacher from the United States. She taught her students how to use primary sources and problem-solving to do their research in college. Anna Strunsky was inspired by Sheldon's work.
Mary Downing Sheldon was born in Oswego, New York. She had four siblings. She was the oldest of them all. Her mother was named Frances Stiles. Her father was Edward Austin Sheldon. Her father founded Oswego State Normal and Training School. Sheldon would go to school there. She graduated in 1869. She worked there as a teacher for two years. She then went to school at the University of Michigan. She graduated in 1876 with a degree in classics. She went back to Oswego State Normal and Training School where she taught for two years. She taught history, Latin, botany, and Greek. She stopped work at Oswego and started working at Wellesley College in 1876. She worked there for two and a half years. She used case methods in her teaching. She quit working there in 1879 because she was sick and also had problems with the people who worked there. After she quit, she relaxed so she would feel better, and then traveled for fun. In 1882, she went back to work at Oswego. She wrote a book while she was there, called "Studies in General History". It was published in 1885.
On August 6, 1885, Sheldon got married. She married a man named Earl Barnes. She met him when he was a student of hers, and he was 11 years younger than her.

Knott's Berry Farm

Knott's Berry Farm is a theme park in Buena Park, California that is owned by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Since the theme park was purchased by Cedar Fair, the number of people who visited the park has increased. According to the 2013 Global Attractions Attendance Report, Knott's Berry Farm is the 13th most visited theme park in North America. The park has 40 rides, including roller coasters, family rides, children's rides, water rides, and historical rides, and there are plans to make the park bigger in the future.
The theme park sits on what used to be a berry farm that was built by Walter Knott, Cordelia Knott, and their family. Starting around 1920, the family started selling berries, berry preserves, and pies from a roadside stand along a highway. In 1934, the Knotts started selling fried chicken dinners inside a tea room that is on the farm. They later built shops and other attractions to entertain visitors. In 1940, Walter Knott built a ghost town on the farm, and added other attractions over many years. In 1968, Knott's Berry Farm started to charge people to visit the park. In 1983, the park added Camp Snoopy.
In the 1990s, the Knott children sold the family business after Walter and Cordelia Knott died. The theme park was sold to Cedar Fair and the food business was sold to ConAgra Foods, which was later sold to The J.M. Smucker Company.
Cedar Fair continued to make the park bigger in 1999 by adding Knott's Soak City. They also added more rides to Knott's Berry Farm.
The idea of an amusement park really picked up in the 1950s when Walter Knott opened a "summer-long county fair". In 1968, for the first time, an admission price was required to get into the park, originally set at 25 cents. The Calico log ride was added in 1969. On April 12, 1974, Cordelia Knott died, and Walter turned his attention toward political causes.
Sky Tower was built to support two attractions, the Parachute Sky Jump (now closed) and the Sky Cabin. Parachute Sky Jump boarded one or two standing riders looking forward to the thrill of the drop into baskets beneath a faux parachute canopy. From the top, eight arms supported the vertical cable tracks of wire rope which lifted the baskets. The Sky Cabin ringed the support pole with a single floor of seats that is surrounded behind windows. The Sky Cabin ring revolves slowly as it rises to the top and back offering a pleasantly changing view.. Sky Cabin is very sensitive to weather and passenger motion, such as walking, which is not allowed during the trip. During winds 25 mph+ or rain it is closed. When built, Sky Tower was the tallest structure in Orange County (a distinction now held by nearby WindSeeker.) The illuminated "K" in logo script atop the Sky Tower was designated a landmark which prevented Knott's plan of changing the foundation to support WindSeeker.
Corkscrew debuted in 1975 as the first modern-day roller coaster to perform a 360-degree inverting element, twice. It was designed by Arrow Development. Corkscrew is still operating to this day, but was sold and moved in 1989 to Silverwood in Athol, Idaho. Montezooma's Revenge was later opened in 1978 and remains in operation at Knott's Berry Farm.

Leopoldo Galtieri

Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri Castelli (15 July 1926 12 January 2003) was an Argentine general and politician. He served as President of Argentina from 22 December 1981 to 18 June 1982. This was during the last military dictatorship (known officially as the National Reorganization Process). He was removed from power soon after the British retook the Falkland Islands, whose invasion he had ordered.
Galtieri was born in the Buenos Aires area. He entered the Argentine Army, and studied engineering. He was a skilled engineer, and he rose quickly through the ranks of the Argentine military. In 1975, he became the head of the Engineering Corps of the army. 
When Jorge Rafael Videla took power a year later, Galtieri supported him. Videla was a brutal dictator, and thousands of people were murdered under his rule. 
In 1981, Videla stepped down. Galtieri took power late that year after removing Roberto Viola in a coup d'état. Although not as brutal as Videla, he continued the "Dirty War."
The United States supported Galtieri. He was a strong anti-communist. Because of this, the United States saw Argentina as an ally against the Soviet Union in the Cold War.
Soon after Galtieri took power, the Argentine economy was about to fall apart. Inflation, the rate at which new money is put into the economy, was as high as 130%. Unemployment was very high, and the state oil company lost six billion dollars in a matter of months. This is the worst loss of money any corporation has had in all of history. 
Galtieri allowed people to disagree with him more than the leaders who came before him. Protests against his dictatorship became common.
By 1982, Galtieri's popularity was low. He wanted more people to support him. He also wanted to increase Argentine patriotism. For many years, Argentina had said the Falkland Islands (a British territory) was actually theirs. The British did not see Argentina as a war threat, and didn't heavily defend the islands. 
With Jorge Anaya, one of the other members of the junta, Galtieri thought of a plan to take over the islands. Galtieri ordered the Argentine military to invade the islands. After bombarding the capital city, Port Stanley, Argentina forced the British Governor of the islands, Rex Hunt, to surrender.
Galtieri became very popular after the invasion, and huge celebrations were held in Buenos Aires. His regime seemed to be very strong. But Galtieri had badly misread what British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher would do. He also believed he would have the support of the United States. However, the United States (and most of the world) supported Britain. 
The British sent their armed forces to the islands. After heavy fighting, the British defeated Argentina in June. Within days, the Argentine army turned on Galtieri, and he was removed from power.
Afterwards, Galtieri was put on trial for crimes against humanity. Although one report wanted him to be executed, he was sentenced to twelve years in prison. In 1989, he was pardoned. 
After leaving prison, Galtieri lived in a suburb of Buenos Aires. Never a rich man, he lived modestly for the rest of his life. Galtieri died from a heart attack caused by surgery to remove a cancerous tumor in his pancreas. He was 76 years old. 
Today, Galtieri is commonly viewed as a very incompetent dictator. He is often blamed for Argentina losing the Falklands War.

Fighters have three different types of fighting variations. The makers are planing on having a fully-connected online functionality.
There have been four new fighters that have been announced for the game so far: D'Vorah, a woman who controls insects; Ferra/Torr, a pairing consisting of a small girl and a giant masked brute; Cassie Cage, the daughter of Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade; and Kotal Kahn, a character that have not been described yet. According to series creator Ed Boon, the game's main villain will be a "surprise returning character."
Game Informer rated the game a 9.25 out of 10. Brian Shea of "Game Informer" said that the game was "more than the continuation of NetherRealm’s successful vision for the franchise; it’s one of the best fighting games in years". 
The Escapist rated the game 4.5 out of 5 stars. Joshua Vanderwall of "The Escapist" said that he liked the gameplay and the roster. He called the options "exquisite fighting-game experiences".

Districts of Wales

In 1974, Wales was re-divided for local government purposes into thirty-seven districts. Districts were the second tier of local government introduced by the Local Government Act 1972, being subdivisions of the eight counties introduced at the same time. This system of two-tier local government was abolished in 1996 and replaced with the current system of unitary principal areas.
Each district was administered by an elected district council. The council was entitled to petition for a charter granting borough status, whereupon the district became a "borough" and the district council a "borough council" headed by a mayor. In addition, a district could be granted Letters Patent granting city status.

Gendarmerie Nationale

In France, the National Gendarmerie is one of the divisions of the French Armed Forces, the military police. They are responsible for the public safety. They act like police for the citizens of France. It also contains a military police force and a special forces component, the GIGN. In 2011 more than 98,155 people were working for the National Gendarmerie in France.
The Gendarmerie works together with the other national law enforcement agency, the Police Nationale. And since 2009, even though this force is a part of the armed forces establishment, it belonged to the Ministry of the Interior as its military component and it is part of its operations and the budget. They fulfill national security duties and duties in support of their ministry. 
They are also responsible for road patrols. The police can stop drivers. When they do so, it is called a contrôle. They can ask for a driver's identification papers and car papers at any time. 
Their weapon quote is Gendarmerie, une force humaine. This literally means "Gendarmerie, a human armed force."
The name "Gendarmerie" comes from "gens d’arme," which means "armed people." This military corp has an exploding grenade as its logo. Instead of metal medals, Gendarmes wear ribbons. These are called bâtons. They get ribbons, inter alia, for service abroad. 
Since a few years ago, the Gendarmes' flat hat, called a képi, has only been used for special occasions. 
The French did not have a uniform until the late 17th century, though some companies had recognizable coat colors. Light grey was common, but red and blue were also worn. It was said that the French in the 17th century had an addiction to bows, ribbons, and plumes, which was suitable to the future leaders of European fashion. Guard Gendarmes probably had red coats. Many guard troops wore the royal badge on their back and their breast. In the 16th century, national signs were that they wore a white cross on their back and on their breast. In the 17th century this became a white sash. 
Nowadays the Gendarmerie uses bulletproof and tactical vests and body armour. A anti-riot shield is used during a heavier riot. They also make use of the spectra helmet. This spectra helmet is fitted with a visor for extra protection of the face. If a tear gas is used, the operators use a special gas mask, which protects them from the dangerous gasses. They also have apparatus for throwing tear gas canisters and FAMAS riffles. This is a sort of weapon. This equipment helps protect Gendarmes while they are doing their jobs.
This is the territorial police branch of the Gendarmerie. It is the branch that is most similar to France’s common police. It has regular contact with France’s population and does jobs similar to the Police of France. The Departmental Gendarmerie is divided into Brigades consisting of 6 to 40 operators. A brigade performs observation and may give assistance to citizens in regulated periods, during both daytime and nighttime.
The Mobile Gendarmerie has several tasks, which include riot control, security of significant places (like embassies), conducting OPEX (External Operations), and providing support to the Departmental Gendarmerie. It is divided into 25 legions, including one advanced armoured anti-riot police group. The Mobile Gendarmerie has control over the GIGN, the counter-terrorism part of the Gendarmerie Nationale.
The GIGN members are well trained to conduct special operations such as hostage rescue. They are also trained in maritime anti-terrorism operations. They are trained to conduct operations with no risk to the public and the hostages. 
A ceremonial unit that takes part in parades and secures important locations in a formal way.
Supervised by the Gendarmerie and the French Navy, the Maritime Gendarmerie conducts maritime surveillance, assistance and rescue at sea; police security at naval bases; and police at sea. They do these jobs not only in France, but also in other countries like French Guiana, Guadeloupe, and others.
The air transport gendarmerie is similar to the Gendarmerie de L’air. The Gendarmerie de L’air conducts safety operations in air force bases and goes to accidents involving military aircraft. Its missions include securing civilian airports, surveillance of technical things in the airport (like control towers), traffic control on the roads near airports, and making sure that important visitors are safe and well protected at airports.

Fishing reel

A fishing reel is a device attached to a fishing rod used in winding and unwinding fishing line. 
Modern fishing reels are designed to help in casting for distance and accuracy. Reels also retrieve line, usually with a handle. Fishing reels are traditionally used in the recreational sport of angling. They are also used in the sport of competitive casting. Reels are usually attached to a fishing rod by some means. However specialized reels are made to be mounted directly to the boat gunwales or transoms. 
The first writing describing a fishing reel is from about 1100 years ago in China. Fishing reels first appeared in England around 1650 AD. By the 1760s, London tackle shops were advertising gear-retrieved reels. An American watchmaker and inventor, George W. Snyder, invented the first gear multiplying reel abut 1810.

Triangular gimbap

Triangular gimbap ( is a kind of gimbap. It is made from steamed white rice (bap) and various other ingredients. It is wrapped by gim (sheets of dried laver seaweed) in a triangle shape. The plastic wrapping is folded between the gim and rice. People can make it by themselves but usually they purchase it at a convenience store. They tend to eat it to replace their meals. A refrigerator shelf life is within 1 day. Convenience stores have various kinds of triangular gimbap. The price range is from 700 won to 900 won.
Triangular gimbap was first made in Japan. At first, the name was Onigiri. It was ball-shaped and made to serve quick meals during war. Triangular gimbap was introduced to Korea during the 1990s. In 1991, 7-Eleven began to sell it. Family Mart and GS25 followed it. Nowadays, there are various flavors and types of triangular gimbap: tuna with mayonnaise, Jeonju bibimbap, bulgogi, spicy tuna, cheese spicy chicken, and so on.
Triangular gimbap is very convenient. It is easy to replace meals with it. However, it has a few side effects that are harmful to people's health. The amount of sodium and fat it contains is near the Daily Reference Value. The nutrients it contains are 20~30% of the amount a person needs to take a day. Also, synthetic preservative was found. It was revealed that several food additives are added to it because the main resource, rice, is at least 2-3 years old and manufacturers added artificial flavor enhancer to remove rice smell and bleach to make the rice whiter.

<doc id="454495" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=454495" title="Casting (fishing)">
Casting (fishing)

In fishing, casting is the act of throwing bait or a lure using a fishing rod, reel, and line. Several types of rod and reels are designed just for casting. The method of casting can vary but in each case the object of casting is to get the bait or lure to where the fish are. 
The most accurate type of cast is the 'overhead cast'. The angler raises the rod (and reel) back behind the head, then quickly flicks the rod forward, releasing the line as the cast is completed. The 'side cast' is less forceful but easier to learn. The rod is swung back in a horizontal motion then quickly moved forward releasing the line. Both basic methods have variations. But both are popular when using spinning and casting rods. Fly fishing uses similar movements, but the line release is different. All types of rods and reels need to match the weight rating of the rod, reel, line and lure for best performance. 
Anyone can learn to cast a lure with a spinning rod and reel in just a few minutes. Two types of spinning reels, open faced and close faced. They work differently. With a closed face reel a push-button his held down and released at the end of the cast. Open face reels require the angler to first open the bail, then hold and release the line with your forefinger as you cast. Open faced reels have a disadvantage when casting short distances. Short casts causes the line to twist. This in turn causes line tangles on the spool. Spinning rods and reels work best using light line and light lures. Spinning reels have an advantage over casting reels when casting into the wind.
Bait casting (also called "baitcasting") reels come in different sizes and capacities. Depending on use, they also can have different features. The common feature is a horizontal spool that the line winds onto. Casting reels usually have better control of the line and lure. They have better accuracy than other types. Bait casting reels are better at handling heavier line and lures. But there is a to become skilled with a bait casting rod and reel. To cast a bait casting reel, a push-button is pressed and held until you want to release the line. Bait casting reels have a tendency to 'snarl' or 'backlash'. This is because during the cast the line is coming off the reel at a high rate of speed. When the lure hits the water the line stops. But the spool on the reel keeps turning, causing the line to snarl up. This is even more so when casting into the wind. Practice with bait casting reels minimizes this problem. To control snarling, bait casting reels usually have a brake. This automatically stops the spool when the line stops. Reels have either a magnetic brake control or a centrifugal brake control. Some have both. These must be adjusted to balance between good distance in casting and preventing backlash. Many anglers set the brake lightly to allow more distance. Then they control the braking with their thumb on the spool. Low-profile bait casting reels are designed especially for using the thumb.
Among the specialized types of casts with a bait casting rod are two made popular by tournament fishermen:
In both methods, the rod is used to swing the lure (like a pendulum) out over the water. In both cases the lure enters the water very quietly and so as not to frighten the fish.
<br>
Fly fishermen use artificial flies as a lure. Most flies have almost no weight and by themselves could not be cast with other types of rods and reels. The fly rod works because it uses a much heavier line than the other types. It is the line that is being cast. The fly simply goes where the line goes. Fly casting looks more difficult than it is. In less than a couple of hours most beginners can learn the basic cast. Fly casting is more involved than other types of casting. There are fly fishing schools that teach fly casting. 
To cast a fly rod, the angler pulls several feet of line off the reel. The rod tip is moved back then in a fluid motion and accelerating, it is moved forward as the line is released. In fishing streams and rivers, trees and shrubs on the bank may prevent an overhead cast. Another type of cast is the 'roll cast'. Using the rod tip the fisherman forces the rod tip down to roll the line forward. Most fly lines are rated by a weight system. A 1wt (one weight) is very light while a 13wt is very heavy. It would be suitable for large salt water fish. Rods (and reels) are rated by the weight of the line they are designed for. Unfortunately there is no one size for all kinds of fish and fishing situations.
The term may also be used for casting a net. The net is cast (thrown) by hand so that it spreads out on the water and sinks. Fish are caught in the net and it is hauled back in. Net casting is often used to catch fish for bait. Modern cast nets have a radius of from 4 to 12 feet (1.2 to 3.6 metres). A larger net full of fish may take more than one person to pull it in. Cast nets also sometimes use a 'net thrower' device. This helps spin the net as its thrown, keeping it open. Cast nets work best in shallow water.
Casting (known as Casting Sport) is also a sport. The sport is supervised by the International Casting Sport Federation (ICSF). As of April 2014 are in 31 countries.
Casting competitions were active in England and the United States in the later 1800s. In 1881 the first tournament was held just outside of London. In 1955, 14 different national associations started the ICF (now ICSF). The ICSF sets all international standards for the sport. It sponsors tournaments. It also recognizes world records for accuracy and distance. This sport uses plastic weights or hookless flies. Competitions can be held on water or on athletic fields. There are competitive divisions for almost all types of fly, fixed spool and revolving spool tackle, and competitor classes. Competitive casting is part of the World Games.
World Championship in 2014 are to be held in Szamotuly (Poland), from 3 to 7 September.

Rangeley is a town in Franklin County, Maine in the United States. The population was 1,168 in the 2010 census. The town is on the east side of Rangeley Lake, in the Western Maine mountains. It is a popular summer resort. The winters are very cold with a snow cover. A sign in town says that Rangeley is halfway between the Equator and the North Pole.
Rangeley is named after an English settler, Squire James Rangeley. He had a 31,000 acre piece of land that was bought in 1796 by his father. He came in 1825 to build the town. He built a sawmill, a gristmill, a mansion, and a ten-mile road to get to other towns. 
The Phillips and Rangeley railroad opened in 1891 and tourists from Boston; Hartford; New York; and Philadelphia started to come. In the early 1900s, Rangeley became a summer resort area with camps, cabins, summer homes, and hotels. The cool mountain climate and plenty of sport fishing make this a likeable town.
Some local people became fishing guides for visitors. Among the fishermen was President Herbert Hoover. The big hotels went away during World War II. The Rangeley Lake House was torn down in 1958. New hotels have taken their place, so Rangeley remains popular.
One of many famous people who lives in Rangeley is Kurt Russell, the movie star. He quietly owns a home in the mountains here. He is locally called by the name "Snake Plisskin". His father, the actor Bing Russell, was a native of Rangeley.
Wilhelm Reich, a well-known Austrian-American psychiatrist and psychoanalyst made his home in Rangeley during his later years. He took over a large estate () and named it Orgonon. It became his home, laboratory and research center. Reich is buried here on the grounds. It is now open to the public as the Wilhelm Reich Museum, with rental cottages available.

IPod Touch (5th generation)

The fifth generation iPod Touch (sold as iPod touch, sometimes called the iPod Touch 5 or iPod Touch 5G) is a pocket computer that is designed and sold by Apple Inc. It replaces the fourth generation iPod Touch. Like the iPhone 5, it is a thinner and lighter that introduces a 4-inch screen. Other new features include 1080p video recording, panoramic pictures, an LED flash, an Apple A5 processor, and Siri.
The fifth generation iPod Touch also comes in several different colors: space grey, silver, pink, yellow, blue, and Product Red. The fifth generation iPod Touch was announced along with the iPhone 5 on September 12, 2012, and it was released on October 11, 2012.
At first, the device was only sold in 32 and 64 GB models. The first 16 GB model was introduced on May 30, 2013. It was only available in one color, it didn't have a back camera, and it didn't have the iPod Touch loop that the 32 and 64 GB models have. A new version of the 16 GB model was released on June 26, 2014, and it has the back camera as well as more color options. The prices for all iPod Touch models have also dropped on that same day.
The fifth generation iPod Touch runs Apple's iOS mobile operating system. It shipped with iOS 6, which was released on September 19, 2012. It can play music, movies, television shows, eBooks, audiobooks, and podcasts.
The fifth generation iPod Touch is the first iPod Touch to have Siri, which was also on the iPhone 4S and other iPhone models that came after it. The software was made better in iOS 6 to have the ability to open apps, see movie reviews, sports scores, make Facebook or Twitter updates, and more. It also supports iMessage, an instant messaging service that allows users to send unlimited messages to devices that run iOS 5 or later. Some apps and features that came with iOS 6 included Apple Maps, Passbook, and screen mirroring, meaning that you can be able to put the iPod Touch's screen on a television. The new Apple Maps application, which replaced Google Maps, doesn't have many features that other maps apps have. It can also sometimes give wrong directions which are still not fixed, even after the iOS 7 updates. The Passbook app can get boarding passes, tickets, coupons, and other cards. A device with the Passbook app can be scanned under a barcode reader to buy things. A feature called AirPlay was available, meaning that you can put the iPod Touch's screen on an Apple TV or other device. It was the first generation of iPod Touch to support it.
The fifth generation iPod touch currently runs iOS 7, which was released on September 18, 2013. It is the only iPod Touch that supports iOS 7. Apple announced on June 2, 2014 that the fifth generation iPod Touch would support iOS 8 in the fall.
The fifth generation iPod Touch has an aluminum body that is made from the same aluminum that is used in a MacBook. Along with an iSight camera and an LED flash, the fifth generation iPod Touch has a new feature called the "iPod touch loop." There is a button on the bottom left side on the back of the iPod Touch. You press down on the button and you can be able to put a loop around the button.

Messier 54 (or M54 or NGC 6715) is a globular cluster in the constellation Sagittarius. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1778. Later, he included it in his catalog of comet-like objects.
M54 was thought to belong to our Milky Way galaxy, but in 1994 it was discovered that M54 belongs to the Sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy ('Sag DEG'), 
M54 is some 87,000 light-years from us, and has a radius of 150 light-years across. It is one of the most dense globulars. It shines with the luminosity of roughly 850,000 times that of the Sun and has an absolute magnitude of −10.0.
M54 is easily found in the sky, being close to the star ζ Sagittarii. Individual stars cannot be seen with amateur telescopes.
It is on or near SagDEG's center. Some authors think it actually may be its core; but others do not.
In July 2009, a team of astronomers found evidence of a medium-sized black hole in the core of M54.

Muskellunge

The muskellunge (scientific name "Esox masquinongy"), has a number of nicknames such as the muskie and maskinonge (Canada). The Muskellunge is a freshwater game fish and the largest member of the Esox (Pike) family. They are native to northern and eastern North America. Muskies have been introduced into other U.S. states. They are not usually found in great numbers in lakes they inhabit. They are large solitary apex predators and requires large amounts of water to feed their appetites. Muskies are carnivorous and feed on other fish. They are ambush feeders who will strike at anything that moves in or on the water.
Currently there are three recognized subspecies of Muskellunge.
There is also a hybrid called the Tiger muskellunge (or Tiger Muskie). They are a cross between the Muskellunge and the Northern pike ("Esox lucius"). They are smaller than true muskies but can grow up to 1.5 times faster in the first year. They are almost always sterile and cannot reproduce.
True muskies have light colored bodies that can be silver, light green, or light brown. They usually have dark bars on their sides. This is the opposite of the Northern pike which Muskies are sometimes confused with. Northerns have dark bodies with light colored bars on the sides. Muskies also have scales only on the upper half of the cheek. The best way to tell the two apart is the pores under the jaw. Northerns have five or less; muskies have six or more. Males are always smaller than females.
Tiger muskies resemble both muskies and northerns. Their "tiger" stripes are more distinctive than the true musky. Where both species live in the same waters, tiger muskies occur naturally. But they are never in great numbers. Once biologists realized that tiger muskies were a hybrid, they began raising them in hatcheries. There are no size differences between male and female tiger muskies.
The muskie is a very efficient predator. It lays in wait near the shoreline often in shallow water. It hides in weeds, near or under logs and rocks. In the summer as the water warms up, Muskies move to the cooler waters at lower depths. But will remain close to shallow water using drop-offs for cover. Muskies can stand water up to 90 degrees F.
Muskies forage (feed) mainly on other fish such as suckers and perch. They are ambush feeders who will nearly anything. They have been known to eat Loons, ducks and small mammals like Muskrats. 
When the water temperature reaches 60°F, muskies feed heavily. At 80° the feeding slows down. They have a preference for larger fish over small fish. Muskies strike quickly. They often take their prey to a secluded area before eating it. They remain in the same area of a lake, sometimes for their entire lifetime.
Muskies are one of the largest freshwater fish in North America. The largest on record was 69 pounds, 15 ounces. Average muskies are usually less than 40 inches long and might weigh from 7 to 15 pounds. Muskies can live up to 30 years.
Just after the ice melts on northern lakes (called ice-out) and the water temperature is between 49° and 59°F, muskies begin to spawn. In lakes where both northern pike and muskies live, muskies spawn after the northerns. A female lays between 60,000 to 100,000 eggs. In lakes with northern pike and muskies, the muskie seems to have fewer numbers of surviving fry. Two reasons are suggested. Since northerns hatch about two weeks earlier than muskies, the young northerns feed on the smaller muskie fry. Another reason is that the young muskie fry swim just below the surface of the water. They are easily seen by fish below or birds flying over the water.
Muskies are an elusive fish but highly prized by anglers. Many fishermen specialize in muskie fishing and will fish for no other species. They are called "the fish of 10,000 casts". This gives some idea of how difficult they are to catch. According to many guides, muskies do not fear anything, including fisherman. They routinely follow lures back to the boat without striking. Sometimes they will flick a lure or fly back at the fisherman. Hooking a muskie is hard. Landing one is even harder. Once hooked they can fight for hours. Skill and luck are needed to land one. 
Muskies require very careful handling by anglers. A trophy size musky is an old fish. A 30 pound female may be 17 years old. If taken as a trophy they are not easily replaced. For that reason catch and release is strongly recommended. A musky may still fight being handled. They are large powerful fish with very sharp teeth. The mortality rate can be very high for fish that are handled carelessly.

Galaxy group

A galaxy group is a group of galaxies made up of less than 50 or so members and bound by gravity. Collections of galaxies larger than groups are called galaxy clusters or superclusters. Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is in the Local Group of more than 40 galaxies.
Galaxy groups are the smallest groups of galaxies. They usually have no more than 50 galaxies. The group in a diameter of 1 to 2 megaparsecs (about 4 to 8 million light-years). Their mass is about 10 solar masses. This is just a guide, because larger and more massive galaxy systems are sometimes called galaxy groups.

Supercluster

Superclusters are large collections of smaller galaxy groups and galaxy clusters. They are one of the largest known structures in the cosmos.
Superclusters show that the galaxies in the universe are not evenly distributed. Most, perhaps all, are in groups and clusters. Groups have some dozens of galaxies, and clusters up to several thousand galaxies. Those groups and clusters plus more isolated galaxies form even larger collections called superclusters.
Superclusters themselves form even larger structures, called "filaments", "complexes", "walls" or "sheets", like the Great Wall. These may span between several hundred million light-years to 10 billion light-years, and cover more than 5% of the observable universe. Superclusters suggest something about the initial condition of the universe when these superclusters were formed. The directions of the rotational axes of galaxies within superclusters may also tell us about the formation of galaxies early in the history of the Universe.
Inside superclusters are large voids of space in which few galaxies exist. Superclusters are often subdivided into groups of clusters called "galaxy clouds".

Politics of the United States

The United States is a federal constitutional republic, in which the President of the United States (the head of state and head of government), Congress, and judiciary share powers reserved to the national government, and the federal government shares sovereignty with the state governments.
The executive branch is mostly about the President and is independent of the legislature. Legislative power is rights in the two chambers of Congress, the Senate and the House of Representatives. 
The judicial branch (or judiciary), made of the Supreme Court and lower federal courts, focuses on the judicial power (or judiciary). The judiciary's main focus is to change the meaning of the United States Constitution and federal laws and rules. This includes solving problems between the executive and legislative branches. The federal government's layout is explained in the Constitution.
Two political parties, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. They have made a large difference in American politics since the American Civil War. 
There are also smaller parties like the Libertarian Party, the Green Party, and the Constitution Party. The Whig Party and the Democratic-Republican Party were important many years ago.
There are major differences between the political system of the United States and that of most other developed democracies. These include greater power in the upper house of the legislature, a wider scope of power held by the Supreme Court, the separation of powers between the legislature and the executive, and the dominance of only two main parties. Third parties have less political influence in the United States than in other developed country democracies.
The federal object created by the U.S. Constitution is the main feature of the American governmental system. However, most people are also subject to a state government, and all are subject to various units of local government. The latter include counties, municipalities, and special districts.
The federal government was created by the states, which as colonies were established separately and governed themselves independently of the others. Units of local government were created by the colonies to carry out various state functions. As the country expanded, it admitted new states modeled on the existing ones.
In each state there are governors. They are in charge of their state. They make and pass bills that would become laws in their countries. There are also two senators who represent their state in congress. There are also representatives who represent a district in their state and also represent them in congress.
The President of the United States is the head of state of the United States. They are elected by the American citizens every four years in democratic elections. They also appoint people who will work in different departments that focuses on special areas for the country.

Least common multiple

The least common multiple of two integers is the smallest positive integer between all the multiples of both. It is usually denoted by LCM("a", "b"). Likewise, the LCM of more than two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of them.
The LCM is known in elementary arithmetic as the "least common denominator" (LCD) that must be calculated before fractions can be added, subtracted or compared.
A multiple of a number is the product of that number and an integer. For example, 10 is a multiple of 5 because 5 × 2 = 10, so 10 is divisible by 5 and 2. Because 10 is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 5 and 2, it is the least common multiple of 5 and 2. By the same principle, 10 is the least common multiple of −5 and 2 as well.
It is known that:
This formula is often used to compute the LCD, once known the GCD of "a" and "b".

Christ the Redeemer (), is a statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. From 1931 until 2010 it was the largest Art Deco statue in the world. It is tall. It sits on a pedestal on the peak of the tall Corcovado mountain. The statue overlooks the city. 
The first electric railway in Brazil was built in the late 1800s. At that time people would go to the top of the Corcovado Mountain to enjoy the panoramic view of the city below. Construction started in 1926 and took five years. During that time workers balanced themselves on scaffolds with no safety equipment. It was risky work but during the entire construction period, no workers were killed. Many regarded that as a miracle. The statue was finished in 1931. It was built to celebrate the 100 year anniversary of Brazil's independence from Portugal. The statue was built in France by the sculptor Paul Landowski. He never came to Rio to see the sculpture in place.
The statue underwent a $4 million renovation in 2010. Since then it has been damaged by lightning at least two times. Repairs in 2014 added more lightning rods to prevent future damage from lightning. 
The statue is maintained by the Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro.

Esox is a genus of fresh water fish. It is the only living genus in the family Esocidae. The oldest known example of Esox is the fossil "Esox tiemani". It dates to about 62 million years ago and was found in Alberta, Canada. Esox are commonly called pike and pickerel. They are found in the northern parts of North America, Europe and Asia. One species, "Esox lucius", the Northern pike, is found in both Europe and North America. Esox are large predatory fish with a long cylindrical body. They have a green color (various shades) with yellow eyes. Pike and pickerel share a forked tail fin and a large pointed head. Their dorsal and anal fins are located far back on their bodies. All species have very sharp teeth.
Currently there are five species in the Esox family. The study of this family is not complete. There are several known hybrids between species which occur naturally. The five species are:
All species of Esox are predatory feeders. They eat other fish, small mammals and birds. Pike will eat almost anything that doesn't eat them first.

Planetary system is the general term for a star with planets and other objects in orbit around it. The solar system is one of these. It is now clear that many other stars have planetary systems.
The 21st century has become a golden era of planetary system discovery. 1795 such planets in 1116 planetary systems, including 461 multiplanet systems. Hundreds more systems are unconfirmed. (2014 data)
The closest confirmed system is Gliese 832 at 14.8 light years (ly) with one confirmed planet, whereas the closest unconfirmed system is Alpha Centauri at 4.37 ly with a planet of Earth mass. The closest multi-planet system is Gliese 876 at 15.3 ly with four confirmed planets.
Of particular interest to astrobiology is the habitable zone of planetary systems. This is thought to be the region with the most potential to develop extraterrestrial life.
Multiplanetary systems are stars with at least two confirmed planets, beyond our Solar System.
From the total of 1116 stars known to have exoplanets (as of June 2014, there are a total of 461 known multiplanetary systems. About 280 of these have only two confirmed exoplanets, but some have more. The star with the most confirmed planets is our Sun with 8 confirmed planets, while the stars with the most confirmed exoplanets are Kepler-90 and HD 10180 with 7 confirmed planets each; in 2012, two more exoplanet candidates have been suggested for HD 10180, which would bring the total to 9 exoplanets in that system.
Gliese 876, with 4 confirmed exoplanets, is the closest multiplanetary system at 15 light years from our Solar System. A total of 12 systems are known that are closer than 50 light years away, but most are much farther away. The farthest confirmed multiplanetary system is OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L, at 13300 ly away.
The two most important stellar properties are mass and metallicity because it determines how these planetary systems form. The higher mass and metallicity tend to have more planets and more massive planets.

Rhyme scheme

A rhyme scheme is the pattern of rhyme between lines of a poem or song. It is usually referred to by using letters to indicate which lines rhyme; lines designated with the same letter all rhyme with each other. Therefore, it is the pattern of end rhymes or lines. The most basic rhyme schemes are aa, aaa, aabb, abab and abba. There are also more complicated schemes, as ababbcc (rhyme royal), abababcc (ottava rima) or ababbcbcc (Spenserian stanza). Sonnets may have very different rhyme schemes, Italian (abba abba cdc dcd, abba abba cde cde, abba abba cde edc), French (abba abba cdcd ee), Spenserian (abab bcbc cdcd ee) or Shakesperian (abab cdcd efef gg). 
Sometimes there are also internal rhymes. In the following strophe from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" there are rhymes and alliteration:
Some schemes are common, the other are used very rarely. The scheme aabbcc is simple and can be found everywhere, but the scheme abccba, used by Robert Browning in the "Meeting at Night", was never popular:
There are many possibilities of rhyme scheme. For example five-line stanza can have one of ten schemes with two different rhymes: aaabb, aabab, aabba, abbaa, ababa, abaab, aabbb, ababb, abbab, abbba. Another possibily is of course aaaaa.
Notice that two or three rhymes can be linked to each other by repeating the same vowel. The rhyme scheme of Giambattista Marino's poem "Adone" is abababcc (ottava rima), but in this strophe all rhymes are based on the vowel [i]. This feature can be seen only in Italian text:
A rhyme scheme can be typical for a poet, an epoch or a genre. For example the scheme aaabab is typical for Scottish poet Robert Burns. Rhyme royal ababbcc is typical for medieval English poetry. And ottava rima is typical for epic poems. Many great epic poems were written in Italian, Spanish or Portuguese with the use of abababcc scheme.

Saint-Gaudens (Gascon: "Sent Gaudenç") is a commune in the Haute-Garonne department in southwestern France. It is the capital of the "arrondissement" of Saint-Gaudens and of the canton of Saint-Gaudens.
In antiquity, the present place of the city was near a Roman road between Toulouse and Dax, where there was a rural area called "Mansus"; "Mansus" was named later as "Mas Saint-Pierre" after the Christianization of the region.
In 475, a young Christian boy, Gaudens, was killed by the Visigoths and he was buried in this place. The town took its current name in the ninth century, because may people came here to worship the martyr; the relics of Gaudens were deposited in the church of Mas-Saint-Pierre.
As an important regional market place, Saint-Gaudens became the economic capital of the Comminges (a natural region and an old French region on the hills at the base of the Pyrenees).
The city of Saint-Gaudens is in the Comminges, at the foot of the Pyrenees. It is about to the southwest of Toulouse and at about from Tarbes (Hautes-Pyrénées).
It is found on the left side of the Garonne river.
The "commune" has an area of and its average altitude is ; at the city hall, the altitude is ..
The climate of Saint-Gaudens, in the Köppen climate classification, is Cfb - Oceanic climate with template summers.
The inhabitants of Saint-Gaudens are known, in French, as "Saint-Gaudinois" (women: "Saint-Gaudinoises").

Fat feminism

Fat feminism is a version of feminism mixed with fat activism. Fat-positive feminists are into accepting women of all sizes. Fat feminism began in second-wave feminism. The field is growing within third-wave feminism.
According to one survey, 56 percent of overweight women are disrespected by their doctors. Forty-six percent say doctors are uncomfortable with the women's weight.
Fat feminists oppose the concept of fixed body images imposed from society. These feminists condemn fat jokes on sitcoms. They also condemn the promotions of skinny figures in Hollywood, on television and on catwalks.
Fat feminists contest the belief one cannot be overweight and fit at the same time.
The movement began in the late 1960s. It has become more popular over the years.

Epsilon Eridani

Epsilon Eridani (ε Eri, ε Eridani) is a star in the southern constellation Eridanus, just south of the celestial equator. It can be seen from most of Earth's surface. 
It is 10.5 light years (ly) away, and has an apparent magnitude of 3.73. It is the third closest individual star or star system visible to the unaided eye.
Epsilon Eridani was the closest star known to host a planet until the unconfirmed discovery of Alpha Centauri Bb. Its age is less than a billion years. Because of its youth, Epsilon Eridani has a more active magnetic field than the present-day Sun. Its stellar wind is 30 times as strong. Its rotation period is 11.2 days at the equator. The star is smaller and less massive than the Sun, and has a lower level of metal elements. It is a main-sequence star of spectral class K2, which means that energy generated at the core through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is emitted from the surface at a temperature of about 5,000 K, giving it an orange hue.
Its planet, Epsilon Eridani b, was announced in 2000. The planet orbits in about 7 years. It is about 3.4 astronomical units (AU) away from its star. 
The system includes two belts of rocky asteroids: one at about 3 AU and a second at about 20 AU, whose structure may be maintained by a hypothetical second planet, Epsilon Eridani c. Epsilon Eridani has an extensive outer debris disk of remnant planetesimals left over from the system's formation.
Epsilon Eridani may be a member of the Ursa Major Moving Group of stars that share a similar motion through the Milky Way. This suggests they share a common origin in an open star cluster. Its nearest neighbor, the binary star system Luyten 726-8, will have a close encounter with Epsilon Eridani in about 31,500 years when they will be separated by about 0.93 ly. 
Epsilon Eridani has been the target of SETI searches. Epsilon Eridani appears in science fiction stories and has been suggested as a destination for interstellar travel.

Star system

A star system or stellar system is a small number of stars which orbit each other, bound by gravitational attraction. A large number of stars bound by gravitation is generally called a "star cluster" but, broadly speaking, they are also star systems. Star systems are not to be confused with planetary systems, which include planets and similar bodies.
A stellar system of two stars is known as a "binary star", "binary star system" or "physical double star". If there are no tidal effects, no disturbance from other forces, and no transfer of mass from one star to the other, such a system is stable. Both stars will orbit around the center of mass of the system indefinitely. Examples of binary systems are Sirius, Procyon and Cygnus X-1, the last of which probably consists of a star and a black hole.
It is possible to have star systems with more than two members. Their stars are gravitationally bound to each other, and may or may not be close to each other.
A recently discovered quintuple star system (five stars) is known as 1SWASP J093010.78+533859.5. The system has two sets of binary stars, one of them with a small third star. The two sets are a long way apart, further than the orbit of Pluto is to the Sun. The binary stars are close to each other and one binary has touching stars, with their outer ionised gases mixing. That situation is called a contact binary. From the data collected, the authors are fairly sure that both binaries (and probably all five stars) are gravitationally bound in a single system. The angles of inclination (the angle between the two orbital planes) of the two binaries (88.2(3) and 86(4) degrees). This suggests they originally formed by break-up (~9-10 billion years ago ago) from a single protostellar disk. Afterwards, they stayed in the same orbital plane.
Most multiple star systems are "triple stars". Systems with four or more components are less likely to occur. 
Multiple star systems are smaller than open star clusters, which have more complex dynamics and typically have from 100 to 1,000 stars. Most multiple star systems known are triple. For example, in the 1999 revision of
Tokovinin's catalog of physical multiple stars,
551 out of the 728 systems described are triple.
Multiple-star systems can be divided into two main types: systems which are stable, or systems with chaotic behavior.

Open star cluster

An open star cluster, also known as galactic cluster, is a group of a few hundred or thousand stars. They have roughly the same age, and were formed from the same giant molecular cloud. 
More than 1,100 open clusters have been discovered within the Milky Way Galaxy, and many more are thought to exist. They are loosely bound together by mutual gravitational attraction, but they get disrupted by close encounters with other clusters and clouds of gas. Open clusters generally survive for a few hundred million years, with the most massive ones surviving for a few billion years. 
In contrast, the more massive globular clusters of stars exert a stronger gravitational attraction on their members, and can survive for longer. Open clusters have been found only in spiral and irregular galaxies, in which active star formation is occurring.
Young open clusters may still be in the molecular cloud from which they formed. They light it up and create an H II region. Over time, radiation pressure from the cluster will disperse the molecular cloud. Typically, about 10% of the mass of a gas cloud will form stars before radiation pressure drives the rest of the gas away.
Open clusters are key objects in the study of stellar evolution. Because the cluster members are of similar age and chemical composition, their properties (such as distance, age and chemical composition) are more easily studied than they are for isolated stars. A number of open clusters, such as the Pleiades, Hyades or the Alpha Persei Cluster are visible with the naked eye.

Antares

Antares (α Scorpii, Alpha Scorpii) is a red supergiant star in the Milky Way galaxy and the sixteenth brightest star in the nighttime sky. It is sometimes listed as 15th brightest, depending on how the two brighter components of the Capella quadruple star system are counted. 
Antares is the brightest and most massive star in the Scorpius-Centaurus Association. The Scorpius-Centaurus Association contains thousands of stars with a mean age of 11 million years.
Antares has a secondary, or companion star, Antares B.
The orbit of the companion star is poorly known, with an estimated period of 1,200 to 2,562 years.
Antares has a radius of about 883 times that of the Sun. If placed in the center of our solar system, its outer surface would lie between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Antares is about 550 light-years (170 parsecs) from the Earth. Its visual luminosity is about 10,000 times that of the Sun. Because the star radiates much of its energy in the infrared part of the spectrum, the bolometric luminosity is about 65,000 times that of the Sun. The mass of the star is in the range of 15 to 18 solar masses.

Chain pickerel

The Chain pickerel (scientific name "Esox niger"), has a number of nicknames such as the Grass pickerel, Jack, and Eastern pickerel. The Chain pickerel is a freshwater game fish and the smallest member of the Esox (pike) family. They are native to Atlantic and Gulf Coast tributaries. Chain pickerel have been introduced into the Lakes Ontario and Erie drainages as well as other places. They are found in shallow weedy pools of lakes, streams and tidal and non-tidal rivers. They are ambush feeders who will strike at anything that swims near them. They feed mainly during daylight hours.
Chain pickerel has the same torpedo-like shape of the Muskellunge and Northern pike. They have different markings than either of their family members. They have a chain-like pattern of dark markings on a yellowish to greenish body. This pattern is what they were named for. Like other pike they have a forked tail fin and a long pointed head. Chain pickerel have a dark bar underneath each eye. The eye color is yellow or yellowish. They can live up to 10 years.
In waters not shared with Northern pike or Muskies, Chain pickerel can be abundant. They prefer shallow weedy pools and submerged trees, limbs or man-made structures. These can be dock pilings, or riprap. Pickerel ambush their prey. They eat other fish, frogs, crayfish and small mammals. Young pickerel eat aquatic insects and small Crustacea. During the winter months the adult fish move to deeper water.
Spawning begins when water temperatures approach 50°F. Unlike others in the pike family, Chain pickerel eggs are sticky and ribbons of eggs stick to underwater weeds. Females lay up to 50,000 eggs. Unlike other fish, Chain pickerel do not remain to guard their young fry.
Chain pickerel are not as popular as other game fish. A good number are caught by accident while fishing for other fish. But they are popular with ice fishermen in the winter. Chain pickerel are a very good fighting fish. Anyone hooking one is in for an exciting fight. They will attack a live minnow or any lure that resembles one. In Canada, Walleyes are called 'pickerel' which sometimes confuses identification. But a walleye and a pike are very different in appearance.
The world record for a chain pickerel is 9 pounds 6 ounces. It was caught in Georgia in 1961. Chain pickerel rarely grow longer than 36 inches.

Lego Star Wars: The Yoda Chronicles

Lego Star Wars: The Yoda Chronicles is a American LEGO animated web and television special film series produced by Lucasfilm Limited, WILFILM and Lego company. The series had two seasons as the first season aired in Cartoon Network and the second season aired in Disney XD. The second season was called Lego Star Wars: The New Yoda Chronicels so Cartoon Network could not claim it as there property.
LEGO Star Wars returns in epic style with THE YODA CHRONICLES, a thrilling, funny and action-packed new LEGO Star Wars story told in three animated TV specials! Set in the “Prequel” Star Wars timeline, THE YODA CHRONICLES stars the one and only Yoda—the Jedi Master who has seen it all, done it all, and taught generations of Jedi Knights—in an all-new adventure. With the help of a fresh class of Padawans, Yoda leads the Jedi in a desperate fight to stop Darth Sidious and his minions from creating a new super-weapon that could crush the Republic and win the war for the forces of Evil.
Lucasfilm Ltd. allowed the LEGO group free reign with developing the storyline. The team worked to make sure everything looked consistent if it would have been made with LEGO bricks, as well as adding humor to the story. The story of season one was set during the Clone Wars and season two was set during the Galactic Empire of from "Star Wars A New Hope" to "Star Wars Empire Strikes Back".
The episodes respectively aired on May 29, 2013, September 4, 2013 and November 27, 2013 on Cartoon Network in the U.S. The first of the 3-part animated series aired on Cartoon Network in India on December 1, 2013 at 4:30 pm and the rest aired on December 8, 2013 and December 15, 2013 at the same time. 
On May 3, Disney released the latest episode on Disney Channel and Disney XD. Since Cartoon Network owned the broadcast rights to "Lego Star Wars: The Yoda Chronicles", the name of the series was altered so it could not claim it as their property. The altered title for season two drops "Lego" and adds "New" to the title - "Star Wars: The New Yoda Chronicles". "Escape from the Jedi Temple" has the Younglings' last appearance.
The first three episodes aired in May 2013 on Cartoon Network. The second season had aired a year later in 2014 but as Disney purchased Lucasfilm the second season came on Disney XD.
Lucasfilm Ltd. released the two first movies "The Phantom Clone" and "Menace of the Sith" on DVD with bonus of several mini movies.
The Mini Movies were released on Lego.com.

Tidal locking

Tidal locking (or captured rotation) is when one side of an astronomical body always face another. It is also called synchronous rotation. The classic example is the Moon: the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth. 
A tidally locked body takes just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve around its partner. This makes one hemisphere constantly face the partner body. Usually, at any given time only the satellite is tidally locked around the larger body. If the two bodies are similar in mass, and their distance apart is small, the tidal force will lock "each" to the other. This is the case between Pluto and Charon. 
If the Moon were not spinning at all, it would alternately show its near and far sides to Earth, while moving around Earth in orbit.
It is possible to work out how long it takes for a particular case of tidal locking to occur. It is just a rough estimate, because some factors are poorly known. An example is the rigidity of a planetary body and its change in shape under tidal force. Tidal locking is an aspect of orbital resonance.
Locked to the Earth
Locked to Mars
Locked to Jupiter
Locked to Saturn
Locked to Uranus
Locked to Neptune
Locked to Pluto
Libration is an oscillating motion of orbiting bodies relative to each other. Examples include the motion of the Moon relative to Earth, or of Trojan asteroids relative to planets.
The Moon generally has one hemisphere facing the Earth, due to tidal locking. Therefore, our first view of the far side of the Moon resulted from lunar exploration in the 1960s. 
However, this simple picture is only approximately true: over time, slightly "more" than half (about 59%) of the Moon's surface is seen from Earth due to libration.
Libration is a slow rocking back and forth of the Moon as viewed from Earth, permitting an observer to see slightly different halves of the surface at different times.

The Horsehead nebula (also known as Barnard 33) is a dark nebula in the constellation Orion. 
The nebula is part of the much larger Orion complex. The nebula is located just to the south of the star Alnitak. Alniak is the farthest east on Orion's Belt. It is part of the much larger Orion Molecular Cloud Complex. 
The nebula was first recorded in 1888 by Scottish astronomer Williamina Fleming. It was recorded on photographic plate B2312 taken at the Harvard College Observatory. The Horsehead Nebula is about 1500 light years from Earth. It is one of the most known nebulae because of its shape when seen from Earth. 
The dark cloud of dust and gas is a region in the Orion nebula where star formation is taking place. The nebula contains over 100 known organic and inorganic gases. It also consists of large and complex organic molecules.
The red or pinkish glow comes from hydrogen gas behind the nebula. Magnetic fields channel the gases leaving the nebula into streams that show as streaks in the background glow. A glowing strip of hydrogen gas marks the edge of the massive cloud. Thee densities of stars are different on either side. 
The darkness of the Horsehead is caused by thick dust blocking the light of stars behind it. The lower part of the Horsehead's neck casts a shadow to the left. Bright spots in the Horsehead Nebula's base are young stars just in the process of forming.

Louise Élisabeth was born on 22 November 1693, at the Palace of Versailles. She was a "princesse du sang". In youth, she was known at court as "Mademoiselle de Charolais", a style later borne by her younger sister. Her parents' second daughter, and third child, she was one of nine children:
She was baptised in the chapel of Versailles on 24 November 1698 with her brother Louis Henri and her sister Louise Anne.
The first years of her marriage were full of court cases at the "Parlement de Paris" against her husband due to his violent temper and her desire to leave him.

Orion complex

The Orion complex (sometimes called the Orion molecular cloud complex) is a huge star-forming area in the constellation of Orion. 
It is a large group of bright nebulae, dark clouds, and young star clusters. The cloud is between 1,500 and 1,600 light-years away and is hundreds of light-years across. Several parts of the nebula can be seen through binoculars and small telescopes. Some parts (such as the Orion nebula) are visible to the naked eye.
The nebula is important because of its sheer size. It is also one of the most active regions of stellar formation that can be seen in the night sky. In it are protoplanetary discs and many very young stars. The nebula is very bright in the infrared wavelengths due to the heat-intensive processes involved in star formation. The complex contains dark nebulae, emission nebulae, reflection nebulae, and HII regions.
The following is a list of notable nebulae in the larger nebula complex:
Also the Orion OB1 Association is part of this complex. This is a group of several dozen hot giant stars of spectral types O and B.

Sagittarius A

Sagittarius A (or Sgr A) is a complex radio source at the galactic centre of the Milky Way. It is in the Sagittarius constellation, but hidden from view by large clouds of cosmic dust in the spiral arms of the Milky Way.
It consists of three components: the remains of a supernova Sagittarius A East, the spiral structure Sagittarius A West, and a very bright compact radio source at the center of the spiral, Sagittarius A*. These three overlap: Sagittarius A East is the largest, West appears off-center within East, and A* is at the centre of West.
This feature is about 25 light-years wide. It looks like a remnant from a supernova explosion that happened between 35,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, it would take 50 to 100 times more energy than a standard supernova explosion to create a structure of this size and energy. Sgr A East might be the remains of a star that exploded as it was gravitationally squashed approaching the central black hole.
Sgr A West looks like a three-arm spiral from the point of view of the Earth. Actually it is made of several dust and gas clouds, which orbit and fall onto Sagittarius A* at velocities as high as 1,000 kilometers per second. The surface layer of these clouds is ionized. The source of ionisation is the population of massive stars that also occupy the central parsec of the galaxy. Over hundred such OB stars have been identified so far.
There is a supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy. Sagittarius A* (abbreviated Sgr A*) is the most likely candidate for the position of this central black hole. The Very Large Telescope and Keck Telescope detected stars orbiting Sgr A* at speeds greater than any other stars in the galaxy. One star, S2, orbits Sgr A* at speeds of over 5,000 kilometers per second at its closest approach.
A gas cloud is expected to collide with the black hole in 2014 and provide additional information.

Crash (computing)

A Computer crash is when a computer program stops running normally. The program can be either an application or the computer's operating system. The program may freeze (stop) or may show a crash report explaining what happened. One, called the Blue Screen of Death has a blue screen and means whatever you were working on may have just 'died'. Many crashes involving computers are often the result of machine instructions not running right. Typical causes are if programs' counters are set to incorrect addresses or buffer overflows.
An application crash can happen if an operation (a set of instructions) is performed that is not allowed by the operation system. If an application crashes, any work in progress may be lost. For this reason it is very important to backup computer files every few minutes. In some operating systems, when one application program crashes, other running programs may crash as a result.
Operation systems often crash due to hardware problems. A device driver that is poorly written can cause an operating system to crash. The solution may be to upgrade the driver.

Canis Major dwarf

The Canis Major dwarf galaxy ("CMa dwarf") or Canis Major overdensity ("CMa overdensity") is a disputed dwarf irregular galaxy in the Local Group. It is in the same part of the sky as the constellation Canis Major.
The supposed small galaxy contains a relatively high percentage of red giant stars, and is thought to contain an estimated one billion stars in all.
The Canis Major dwarf is classified as an irregular galaxy. It is now thought to be the closest neighbouring galaxy to our position in the Milky Way. It is about 25,000 light-years away from the Solar System, and 52,000 light-years from the Galactic centre. It has a roughly elliptical shape and is thought to contain as many stars as the Sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy, the previous contender for closest galaxy to us.
The dwarf was discovered in 2003.
Several studies cast doubts on the true nature of this overdensity. Investigation of the area in 2009 showed only ten RR Lyrae variable stars. This is consistent with the Milky Way's halo and thick disk populations, rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy.

Sonderkommando

Sonderkommandos were special work groups made up of prisoners in the Nazi concentration camps during World War II. (In German, "Sonderkommando" means "special unit".) They worked in and around the gas chambers, which the Nazis used to murder many people.
The "Sonderkommandos" did not kill anybody. When the Nazi guards at the concentration camps killed people in their gas chambers, they made the "Sonderkommandos" do a few different jobs:
Usually, the Nazi camp guards chose people for the "Sonderkommando" groups right after those people got to the concentration camps. They almost always chose Jewish prisoners. These people were told they would be killed if they did not agree. They were not told what kind of work they would have to do. Sometimes, the new "Sonderkommando" would find the bodies of their own families in the gas chambers. They were not allowed to change jobs or refuse to work. The only way they could stop working as "Sonderkommando" would be to kill themselves.
Sometimes the groups of "Sonderkommandos" were very big. As the Nazis killed more and more people in the concentration camps, they wanted more "Sonderkommandos". By 1943, at Birkenau concentration camp (also called "Auschwitz II"), the groups of "Sonderkommando" included 400 prisoners. But when many more Jews from Hungary were sent to the camp in 1944, the Nazis added 500 more "Sonderkommando".
The Nazis needed the "Sonderkommandos" to stay strong enough to work. Because of this, they were treated a little better than the other prisoners. They were allowed to sleep in their own barracks. They were also allowed to keep things like food, medicines, and cigarettes that had belonged to people who were killed in the gas chambers. The Nazis allowed these things because they wanted to be able to kill people as quickly as possible in the gas chambers. Without the "Sonderkommando" to help with the dead bodies, the Nazis would not be able to use the gas chambers as much.
Because they knew so much about how the Nazis were killing so many people, the Nazis thought of the "Sonderkommando" as "Geheimnisträger" — people who knew secrets. Because of this, they were kept apart from other prisoners in the camps. The Nazis also did not want anyone outside the camps to know what they were doing. To make sure the "Sonderkommando" could never tell what they knew, the Nazis would regularly kill all of the "Sonderkommando", usually about every 3 months. Then they would choose a new group out of new prisoners just getting to the camps. The new group's first job would be to burn the bodies of the old "Sonderkommandos".
Some "Sonderkommandos" tried to revolt (fight back) against the Nazis. For example, in 1944, "Sonderkommandos" at Auschwitz partly destroyed one of the crematoria used for burning bodies. For months, young Jewish women had secretly been taking small amounts of gunpowder from a weapons factory in the Auschwitz camp. They had been sneaking that gunpowder to men and women in the camp's resistance movement. (The resistance movement was a group of prisoners at Auschwitz who decided to fight back against the Nazis, sometimes in secret ways.) Using this gunpowder, the leaders of the "Sonderkommando" planned to blow up the gas chambers and crematoria, and start a rebellion against the camp's guards.
However, before this plan was ready, people in the camp's resistance movement found out that the Nazi guards were going to murder the "Sonderkommando" on 7 October 1944. The resistance members warned the "Sonderkommando", who attacked the guards with two machine guns, axes, knives and grenades. They killed about 3 guards and hurt about 12 others. A total of 451 "Sonderkommandos" were killed on this day. Some died fighting the camp's guards. Some did not, and were executed later that day by the Nazis.
There were also revolts in two other concentration camps, called Treblinka and Sobibór. At Treblinka, on 2 August 1943, around 100 prisoners were able to escape from the camp. At Sobibór, "Sonderkommando" in one part of the camp (Camp I) revolted on 14 October 1943. The "Sonderkommando" in another part of the camp (Camp III) did not revolt, but were murdered the next day.
Other "Sonderkommandos" fought back secretly. For example, at Auschwitz, in August 1944, members of the "Sonderkommando" were able to take pictures showing bodies being burned and people being sent to the gas chambers. They snuck these pictures out of the camp as proof of what the Nazis were doing.
Fewer than twenty out of several thousand members of the "Sonderkommando" are known to have survived and were able to testify to what happened. After World War II, at some camps, people found notes that members of the "Sonderkommando" had buried or hidden, hoping that someone would find the notes later and know what happened.
Between 1943 and 1944, some members of the "Sonderkommando" at Birkenau (Auschwitz II) were able to get pens and paper, and they wrote about the things they had seen at the camp. They buried the things they wrote near the crematoria. Their writings were found after the war ended.
For example, this note was found buried in the Auschwitz crematoria. It was written by Zalman Gradowski, a "Sonderkommando" who was killed in the revolt on 7 October 1944:"Dear finder of these notes, I have one request of you ... that my days of Hell, that my hopeless tomorrow will find a purpose in the future. I am transmitting [writing about] only a part of what happened in the Birkenau-Auschwitz Hell. You will realize what reality looked like ... From all this you will have a picture of how our people perished [died]."

Totally Spies! The Movie

Totally Spies! The Movie (known as Totally Spies! Le film in France) is a 2009 French - Canadian animated action comedy movie. The movie is part of the "Totally Spies!" series. It tells the beginnings of the three secret agents, how they met and their first mission as members of WOOHP.
Three newcomers, Sam, Clover and Alex, come to Los Angeles and meet by chance, because they are entering the same high school. They are in fact followed closely by a secret agency, the WOOHP, who will recruit them for three seasoned spies. They agree to go through spy training and within 48 hours, they have completed it.
After training, they are thrown into their first mission when rockstars have been abducted. They go to Wolfman's building and later find that each went through a make over by a mysterious machine called the "Fabulizor". They later see that everyone at school also had gone through the Fabulizor and Oinky ends up going through the Fabulizor too. They are almost blasted by one of Fabu's minions in a fighter jet after avoiding Miss Skritch as they sneak back into school. Tailing Mandy that night, they find that all of those who went through the Fabulizor became hypnotized by a special chip in their cheek bones. They then meet the mastermind behind the entire affair, Fabu, a runway model who quickly lost his fame. The spies accidentally expose themselves and are captured by Fabu's strongest henchmen. He then relates his entire plan, to abduct everyone who went through the Fabulizor and place them inside a special space station which he calls Fabutopia; then use a missile to destroy all of Earth, before using his Fabulizor in reverse and give the girls each horrible make overs. He then sets them to be blasted back to Earth in rockets. But when Tad meets the girls again, they are still imprisoned and he says he will let them fail the mission and stop Fabu himself, taking all the credit and regaining his "favorite agent" status with Jerry.
But after a fight with Fabu, Tad is strapped to the missile bound for Earth. The girls manage to escape and go after Fabu. They are unable to stop the missile from taking off but hitch a ride as it is rocketing towards Earth with Tad still attached to it. They are able to turn the missile around to destroy the station and Alex whacks at the control panel with the WOOHP manual. They then are picked up by a surprise appearance from Jerry in one of WOOHP's ships and rescue the kidnapped people from aboard the station and evacuate safely, including Oinky. They are finally reunited with Alex before the missile explodes and destroys the station in a firework finale. They then chase after Fabu's ship, manage to destroy it and catch Fabu and his Sphynx in his escape pod. After the mission, Alex is invited for a session with Wolfman and Clover is offered a date by Rob Hearthrob over the phone.
Miss Skritch had been transferred to another school in Antarctica in an igloo, Fabu, his henchmen and Tad are later imprisoned and set for punishment by WOOHP and everyone who was rescued from aboard Fabu's space station have their minds erased (including Mandy). But just after the girls celebrate getting even with Mandy for the last time, courtesy of one of WOOHP's gadgets, they are sucked away to another mission. The girls are quick to bring up personal appointments, but soon find themselves running from a WOOHP jet as it prepares to suck them aboard. But the girls are ready for their mission as they change into their spy uniforms and exclaim their friendship as the movie ends.
The movie was released in France on 22 July 2009 in 272 theatres.

H II region

An H II region is a region where huge blue stars are formed from hydrogen. They are named after the ionised atomic hydrogen which they produce: H II.
The stars form inside a large cloud of hydrogen gas. The short-lived blue stars formed in these regions give off huge amounts of ultraviolet light. This ionizes the surrounding gas. 
H II regions can be several hundred light-years across. The first known H II region was the Orion nebula, which was discovered in 1610. These regions have extremely varied shapes. They often appear clumpy and filamentary, sometimes showing bizarre shapes such as the Horsehead nebula. 
H II regions give birth to thousands of stars over several million years. Eventually, this produces a star cluster. In the end, supernova explosions and strong stellar winds from the most massive stars blow away the gases of the H II region. This leaves behind behind a cluster of stars such as the Pleiades.
H II regions can be seen at huge distances in the universe.The study of extragalactic H II regions helps to fix the distance and chemical composition of other galaxies. 
Spiral and irregular galaxies have many H II regions, while elliptical galaxies have almost none. In spiral galaxies, like the Milky Way, H II regions are found in the spiral arms, but in the irregular galaxies they are distributed at random. 
Some galaxies have huge H II regions, with tens of thousands of stars. Examples include the 30 Doradus region in the Large Magellanic Cloud and NGC 604 in the Triangulum galaxy.

OB stars are hot, massive blue stars. They are stars of types O or B in the HertzsprungRussell diagram. 
These stars are short lived, and do not move far from where they were formed. During their lifetime, they emit huge amounts of ultraviolet radiation. This radiation ionizes the surrounding interstellar gas of the nebula, forming an H II region.

A grey market (or parallel market) is a market where goods are sold legally, but outside the commonly-used channels and at lower prices. They are sold without the permission of the manufacturer. Consumers buying grey market goods risk not having warranties honored. They risk getting user guides and software in the wrong language. Packages may not include all accessories needed for a particular market. Sometimes grey market goods are sold without packaging, user guides or needed accessories. There is usually no after-sale support for products. Grey market products are often sold via the Internet without charging customers any sales tax. Products sold by grey marketers generally sell for much less than authorized dealers. This causes a loss of tax revenue to governments.

Egyptian language

The Egyptian language was the language spoken in Ancient Egypt. It has a written history of about 5000 years, which makes it one of the oldest written languages known today. The Coptic language is the modern form of the Egyptian language. The Copts, a Christian minority in modern-day Egypt, use it for religious purposes. A few people are still fluent in Coptic. While the modern variant is known, the older variants could only be translated when the Rosetta stone was found in 1799. The Rosetta stone contains the same text in three languages, one of which was known at the time.
The oldest records of the Egyptian language date from about 3400 BC. 
Egyptian was spoken until the late 17th century AD in the form of Coptic. The national language of modern-day Egypt is Egyptian Arabic, which replaced Coptic as the language of daily life in the centuries after the Muslim conquest of Egypt.
Scholars group the Egyptian language into six major chronological divisions:
Egyptian writing in the form of labels and signs has been dated to 3200 BC. These early texts are generally called "Archaic Egyptian."
In 1999, "Archaeology Magazine" reported that the earliest Egyptian glyphs date back to 3400 BC which "...challenge the commonly held belief that early logographs, pictographic symbols representing a specific place, object, or quantity, first evolved into more complex phonetic symbols in Mesopotamia."
Old Egyptian was spoken for about 500 years from 2600 BC onwards. Middle Egyptian was spoken from about 2000 BC for a further 700 years when Late Egyptian made its appearance; Middle Egyptian survived until the first few centuries AD as a written language, similar to the use of Latin during the Middle Ages and that of Classical Arabic today. Demotic Egyptian first appears about 650 BC and survived as a spoken language until the fifth century AD. Coptic Egyptian appeared in the fourth century AD and survived as a living language until the sixteenth century AD, when European scholars traveled to Egypt to learn it from native speakers during the Renaissance. It probably survived in the Egyptian countryside as a spoken language for several centuries after that. The Bohairic dialect of Coptic is still used by the Egyptian Christian Churches.
Old, Middle, and Late Egyptian were all written using hieroglyphs and hieratic. Demotic was written using a script derived from hieratic; its appearance is vaguely similar to modern Arabic script and is also written from right to left. Coptic is written using the Coptic alphabet, a modified form of the Greek alphabet with a number of symbols borrowed from Demotic for sounds that did not occur in contemporary Greek.
Arabic became the language of Egypt's political administration soon after the Arab conquest in the seventh century AD. Over time, it replaced Coptic as the language spoken by the common people. Today, Coptic survives as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Coptic Catholic Church.
The Bible contains some words, terms and names thought by scholars to be Egyptian in origin. An example of this is Zaphnath-Paaneah, the Egyptian name given to Joseph.

Status epilepticus

Status epilepticus (often simply called status) is a medical emergency where the brain will not stop having seizures. In medicine, a person who is having status epilepticus is described as being "in status."
Definitions of status epilepticus have changed over time. It used to be that a seizure had to last 20 or 30 minutes to be thought of as status epilepticus. (Most normal seizures last only one to two minutes.)
Today, a person is usually described as being "in status" when:
Status epilepticus is very dangerous. About ten to twenty percent of the people who go into status will die from it.
Status is a medical emergency for many reasons:
If people in status get the right treatment quickly, they can survive with little or no brain damage.
Only about one in four people who go into status epilepticus have epilepsy. The other three out of four people who go into status have never had a seizure before. Status epilepticus can happen for many other reasons.
Many different illnesses can cause status epilepticus:
Very bad injuries can also cause status:
Illegal drugs, alcohol, and some medications can cause status:
People in status epilepticus are unable to end their seizures on their own. They are often unconscious and unable to react.
The most common way to end status is to inject special medicines that can stop seizures. If these medicines do not help, the patient must be treated in the intensive care unit at a hospital. Sometimes patients have to be put into a coma to stop very bad status epilepticus.

Active galactic nucleus

An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is a compact region at the centre of a galaxy. This central region radiates huge luminosity over the electromagnetic spectrum. The radiation from an AGN is thought to be caused by mass dragged in by the gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole at the centre of the host galaxy.
This electromagnetic radiation is observed in the radio, microwaves, infrared, optical, ultra-violet, X-ray and gamma ray wavebands. 
A galaxy hosting an AGN is called an active galaxy. AGN are the most luminous and persistent sources of electromagnetic radiation in the universe. They can be used to discover distant objects. All theories about the cosmos have to account for AGNs. They are one of the basic facts about the universe.
So-called relativistic jets are extremely powerful jets of plasma which come from some AGNs, notably radio galaxies and quasars. Their lengths can reach several thousand or even hundreds of thousands of light years.

Niels Kaj Jerne

Niels Kaj Jerne (December 23, 1911 – October 7, 1994) is an Danish immunologist.
Jerne won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Georges J. F. Köhler and César Milstein in 1957. They won it "[f]or theories concerning the specificity in development and control of the immune system and the discovery of the principle for production of monoclonal antibodies".
According to Jerne's biographer Thomas Söderqvist, Jerne did not play the role of a bench scientist, he could not pipette accurately, and he did not enjoy experimental work. Jerne's Nobel Prize was awarded for theories, rather than discoveries. He developed the "natural selection theory of immunology," which was proposed by Paul Ehrlich 50 years earlier, although he was missing the clonal selection element proposed by David Talmage and later by Frank Macfarlane Burnet. James Watson had told Jerne that his theory "stinks."
He was married three times and had two sons, Ivar Jerne (born 1936) and Donald Jerne (born 1941), with Tjek Jerne. He had a third son, Andreas Wettstein, with Gertrud Wettstein, in 1971. According to Söderqvist, his wife Tjek was distraught when she had found out that Niels was having an affair with her best friend, Adda Sundsig-Hansen. Tjek had told Adda about her own affairs, and Adda then told Neils about them too. After hearing this, Niels demanded a divorce. Tjek begged him to stay but he refused. She would then kill herself. Her son Ivar had woken up in the morning, smelled gas, and found his mother dead by the oven. His second wife was treated as a servant and nanny by Jerne. He was regularly unfaithful to his wives, and even though he was not physically handsome, he had attracted women by his charm as a conversationalist and his skills in the arts of love, which included a liking for sadism.

George Davis Snell (December 19, 1903 – June 6, 1996) was an American mouse geneticist and basic transplant immunologist.
Snell won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1980 with Baruj Benacerraf and Jean Dausset. They won it "for their discoveries concerning genetically determined structures on the cell surface that regulate immunological reactions". Snell specifically "discovered the genetic factors that determine the possibilities of transplanting tissue from one individual to another. It was Snell who introduced the concept of H antigens."
Snell was born on December 19, 1903 in Bradford, Massachusetts. He was the youngest of three children. In 1926, Snell received a Bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College. After recommendation by John Gerould, his genetics professor at Dartmouth, Snell completed graduate work at Harvard University where he worked with William E. Castle. In 1930, Snell earned his PhD from Harvard. After he earned his PhD, he worked at Brown University from 1930 to 1931. After he left, he spent two years at the University of Texas as a postdoctoral fellow. He worked with H. J. Muller, a pioneer of radiation genetics (and later, a Nobel Prize winner). Snell worked at WUSTL as a teacher from 1933 to 1934. After he had some short stints as a teacher, Snell joined the Jackson Laboratory staff in Bar Harbor, Maine and spent the rest of his life there. He died on June 6, 1996 in Bar Harbor, Maine.

Allan McLeod Cormack

Allan MacLeod Cormack (February 23, 1924 – May 7, 1998) was a South African American Physicist.
Cormack is best known for his work on X-ray computed tomography (CT). He won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1979 for his work. He shared the prize with Godfrey Hounsfield. 
He was born on February 23, 1924 in Johannesburg, South Africa. During his early years, Cormack attended the Rondebosch Boys' High School in Cape Town, and was a member of the debating and tennis teams. In 1944, Cormack received his B.Sc. in physics from the University of Cape Town and in 1945, he received his M.Sc. in crystallography in 1945 from the university. From 1947 to 1949, he attended University of Cambridge as a research student. While there, he met Barbara Seavey, an American physics student. Comack and Seavey would later get married. 
After they got married, Cormack returned to lecture at the University of Cape Town in early 1950. After he took a break at Harvard from 1956 to 1957, Cormack and Seavey moved to the United States. He would then take a job as a professor at Tufts University in 1957. In 1966, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Even though he was mostly working on particle physics, he had a side interest in x-ray technology which led him to develop the theoretical underpinnings of CT scanning. The work that he did on this started at the University of Cape Town and Groote Schuur Hospital in early 1956. It continued shortly in mid-1957 after he returned from his break. His results were afterwards published in two papers in the Journal of Applied Physics in 1963 and 1964. The papers that had been published drew hardly any interest until the first CT scanner was built by Hounsfield and colleagues in 1971 which took Cormack's theoretical calculations into a real application. He was then the recipient of the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine which he shared with Godfrey Hounsfield. In 1990, he was awarded the National Medal of Science.
Cormack and his wife had three children; Margaret, Jean and Robert. Cormack died on May 7, 1998 in Winchester, Massachusetts from cancer. On 10 December 2002, Cormack was posthumously awarded the Order of Mapungubwe for his outstanding achievements as a scientist and for co-inventing the CT scanner.

Deep Web

The Deep Web is the part of the World Wide Web you can not search on common search websites such as Google. The part you can search is called the Surface Web. The first person who used the term "Deep Web" was Mike Bergman, a computer scientist, in the year 2000. 
Some people think that "darknet" and "Dark Web" are the same thing as Deep Web, but they are not. Let's explain what they mean:
In common networks, the Internet Protocols (IPs) of all users are in most cases visible. The Internet Protocol is an important information that reveals, among other things, the location where the user is accessing the Internet from. In darknets, the IPs are hidden, invisible or very difficult to find. This makes many people access darknets because they do not want the others to know this information about them, such as where they are. In other words, they access darknets to have privacy. 
There are many reasons people want privacy in the Internet. One of them is to do things forbidden by governments, such as piracy (which means sharing files protected by copyright laws).

Bee-eater

The bee-eaters are a group of land birds in the family Meropidae.
They live in the Old World and Australasia: Africa, Asia, Europe, Australia, and New Guinea. They have richly coloured plumage and slender bodies. They have long downturned bills and pointed wings, which give them a swallow-like appearance. There are 26 different species of bee-eaters.
As the name suggests, bee-eaters eat flying insects, especially bees and wasps. They catch them in the air by darting from a perch. The birds only catch prey which is flying: they ignore flying insects once they land.
Mostly, they eat honeybees. Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps) make up from 20% to 96% of all insects eaten. Before eating its meal, a bee-eater removes the sting by repeatedly hitting and rubbing the insect on a hard surface. The bird squeezes out most of the venom. 
Bee-eaters live together. They form colonies by nesting in burrows tunnelled into the side of sandy banks, such as those that have collapsed on the edges of rivers. Many of these holes occur together. 
Most of the species in the family are monogamous, and both parents care for the young, sometimes with the assistance of other birds in the colony, a behaviour rather unusual for birds.

Verulamium

Verulamium was an ancient town in Roman Britain. It was in the southwest of the modern city of St Albans in Hertfordshire. 
Much of the Roman city is unexcavated, with the modern city built over it. The ancient Watling Street passed through Verulamium, which was one of the most important towns in Roman Britain. Much of the site and its environs is now a scheduled ancient monument.
Before the Romans, it was a settlement of the Catuvellauni tribe, which called it Verlamion. It was among the first places in Britain recorded by name. 
Verulamium was burnt to the ground and its people slaughtered by Boudica of the Iceni in AD 61. A black ash layer has been found, confirming the Roman written record. The town was rebuilt, and grew to about by the early 3rd century. It was defended by a deep ditch and wall. 
It is the location of the martyrdom of the first British martyr saint, St Alban, who was a Roman patrician converted to Christianity.
Verulamium had a Roman Forum, a basilica and a Roman theatre. Much was damaged by fires in AD 155 and AD 250. The town was rebuilt in stone rather than timber at least twice over the next 150 years. Occupation by the Romans ended between 400 and 450.
There are a few remains of the Roman city visible, such as parts of the city walls, a hypocaust (heating system) still in place under a mosaic floor. Remains of the theatre are on land belonging to the Earl of Verulam. More remains are under the nearby agricultural land, and have never been excavated.

Adze

An adze is an ancient type of "edge tool". It dates back to the stone age. 
Adzes are used for smoothing or carving wood in hand woodworking. They are similar to an axe, but with the head mounted perpendicular (at right angles) to the handle. The cutting edge was made from chipped flint in the Mesolithic, polished stone in the Neolithic, and metal later on.
A very similar (but blunt) tool used for digging in hard ground is called a mattock.

Konrad Emil Bloch

Konrad Emil Bloch (January 21, 1912 – October 15, 2000) was a German American biochemist.
Bloch won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1964 with Feodor Lynen "for their discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of the cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism". 
He was born on January 21, 1912 in Neisse, Prussian Silesia, German Empire (today Poland). He studied at the Technical University in Munich from 1930 to 1934. He fled to the "Schweizerische Forschungsinstitut" in Davos, Switzerland in 1934 because of the Nazi persecutions of Jews. He then moved to the United States in 1936. While in the United States, he was appointed to the department of biological chemistry at Yale Medical School.
He then earned his Ph.D in biochemistry from Columbia University in 1938. He would teach at Columbia University from 1939 to 1946. After that, he went to University of Chicago and then Harvard University where he worked as the Higgins Professor of Biochemistry in 1954. He worked there until 1982. He then retired and served as the Mack and Effie Campbell Tyner Eminent Scholar Chair in the College of Human Sciences at Florida State University.
In 1964, Bloch was the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology which he shared with Feodor Lynen. They won the prize "for their discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of the cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism". The work that they did showed that the body first makes squalene from acetate over many steps and then converts the squalene to cholesterol. Bloch traced the carbon atoms in cholesterol back to acetate. Some of the research that he did was conducted using radioactive acetate in bread mold and this was possible because fungi also produce squalene. The results were confirmed after he tested it on rats. He was one of many researchers that showed acetyl Coenzyme A is turned into mevalonic acid. Both Bloch and Lynen showed that mevalonic acid is converted into chemically active isoprene, the precursor to squalene. Bloch discovered that bile and a female sex hormone were made from cholesterol, which led to the discovery that all steroids were made from cholesterol. His Nobel Lecture was "The Biological Synthesis of Cholesterol."
In 1985, Bloch was named as a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1988.

IOS 5

iOS 5 is the fifth major version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS. It came after iOS 4, and was replaced by iOS 6, which was released on September 19, 2012. The current version of iOS 5 is iOS 5.1.1.
iOS 5 was announced during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2011. Support was dropped for the iPhone 3G and the iPod Touch (2nd generation), and devices that are supported are the iPhone 3GS and later, the iPod Touch (3rd generation) and later, and the first generation iPad and later.
When the iPhone 4S was announced on October 4, 2011, the release date for iOS 5 was also announced. iOS 5 was released on October 12, 2011.
The iPhone 4S already had iOS 5 installed on it, but other devices had to have the update installed through iTunes. At first, many people could not install iOS 5 because they got error messages when they tried to download it. This was because Apple's servers could not keep up with the number of people who are downloading the update.
Apple's cloud-based service, iCloud, came as part of the iOS 5 update. This feature allows users to sync their music, pictures, videos, and more across all of their devices that have iCloud on them. Each user is given 5 gigabytes of storage for free, but they are allowed to sync unlimited amounts of music, apps, books, and photos.
A new feature called iMessage, built into the Messages app, allows anyone with an iOS device to send unlimited messages to people with iOS 5. It also allows iPhone users to send text messages to people who don't have an iOS device. The Messages app used to be only on the iPhone, but iOS 5 brought it to the iPod Touch and iPad.
The Reminders app allows users to make lists and alerts that can be based on a date or a location.
The Newsstand app is not a real app, but it is a folder that shows the newspapers and magazines that the user is subscribed to.
iOS 5 allows devices to sync with iTunes wirelessly for the first time, without being connected to a computer. iOS devices can also be activated and updated over a wireless network for the first time.
In iOS 5, you can get to the camera quickly from the lock screen swiping up on the camera icon. Users can get to the camera without having to enter a passcode, but you can only use the camera. At first, you had to double-click the home button on the lock screen to get to the camera button, but it was changed in iOS 5.1 so that you could swipe up on the camera button.
Notification Center was introduced in iOS 5, and it also changed how notifications are displayed. Instead of a message that appears in the middle of the screen, stopping what was going on at the time, they appear in a banner on the top of the screen. You can access Notification Center by swiping down from the top of the screen, where it is hidden, and it shows notifications that happened in the past.

<doc id="456050" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=456050" title="Compliance (medicine)">
Compliance (medicine)

In medicine, compliance or adherence refers to the fact that a patient follows the advice of the doctor, and takes the prescribed drugs in the quantities prescribed. Compliance is important for the treatment of chronic diseases.
Worldwide, non-compliance is a major obstacle to the effective delivery of health care. In 2003, the World Health Organization estimated that only about half the patients with chronic diseases living in developed countries follow treatment recommendations. In particular, low rates of adherence to therapies for asthma, diabetes, and hypertension are thought to contribute substantially to the human and economic burden of those conditions. Compliance rates may be overestimated in the medical literature, as compliance is often high in the setting of a formal clinical trial but drops off in a "real-world" setting.
Some drugs are difficult to take, because they must be taken at a specific time or interval; sometimes, several drugs must be taken together. This is seen as a major obstacle to compliance. Other factors that may adversely influence compliance are that many patients do not understand the benefits of being treated, or they see side-effects that they were not told about, the drugs costing a lot of money, poor communication or lack of trust between the patient and their health-care provider. Efforts to improve compliance have been aimed at simplifying drug packaging, providing effective medication reminders, improving patient education, and limiting the number of medications prescribed at the same time.

Glaucophyte

The glaucophytes are a small group of freshwater microscopic algae. Together with the red algae (Rhodophyta) and green algae plus land plants (Viridiplantae or Chloroplastida), they form the Archaeplastida.
The glaucophytes are of interest because they may be similar to the original algal type that led to green plants and red algae. The relationships between these groups are not yet clear, and the glaucophytes in particular need more study.
The chloroplasts of glaucophytes are known as 'cyanelles'. Unlike the chloroplasts in other organisms, they have a peptidoglycan layer, like bacterial cell walls. This is thought to be a relic of the endosymbiotic origin of plastids from cyanobacteria.
Glaucophytes have the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll a. They harvest light with the same type of pigment molecules as do cyanobacteria and red algae. Green algae and land plants have lost that pigment, which is known as phycobiliprotein.
Glaucophyte mitochondria and flagella (if present) are similar to forms found in some green algae.
Only 13 species of glaucophytes are known, none of which is particularly common in nature. There are three genera.
The glaucophytes were previously placed in the order Chlorococcales.

Black Lake (Louisiana)

Black Lake is a reservoir located between Creston and Campti in North Louisiana. Water feeds into Black Lake from Black Lake Bayou, a watershed that extends from north of Gibsland in Bienville Parish and south to Clarence in Natchitoches Parish through the parishes of Claiborne, Webster, Bienville, Red River and Natchitoches. The elevation of the lake is . Louisiana Highway 9 runs across Black Lake. On the west side of Highway 9 the body of water is called Black Lake — the east is called Clear Lake or Clear Lake Bayou. The Clear Lake side is near another body of water: Saline Lake. Between Clear Lake and Saline Lake is the Alan Chiverly Dam, constructed in 1934. Road 1226 also extends between the lakes.
Residents about Black Lake use the Campti and Clarence ZIP Codes, 71411 and 71414, respectively. They are zoned to Lakeview Junior/Senior High School. There are boat launches and campgrounds for fishing and boating. Bell's Camp, founded in 1936 by the late Albert and Eva Bell, is still operated by their daughter, Joy Bell Wimberly (born 1924). Nearby is a catfish and steak restaurant known as Sea and Sirloin, which opened in 1983.
Black Lake is wide in some places such as at the Hwy 9 bridge and tight in other places because of the growth of cypress trees. There are channels cut into the lake that allow clearance for boats. Boats stay in the channels or risk grounding the bottom of the boat on tree stumps. The aquatic vegetation such as moss, seaweed and algae are visible at surface level.
The latitude and longitude coordinates for Black Lake are 31.9574, -93.0466 and the altitude is 102 feet (31 m).

The group is claimed to be a clade. It includes eukaryotic cells that:
The unikonts include opisthokonts (animals, fungi, and related forms) and Amoebozoa. By contrast other well-known eukaryotic groups are often referred to as bikonts. Bikonts include Archaeplastida (plants and relatives), Excavata, Rhizaria, and Chromalveolata. These groups may have two flagella (although there are many exceptions).
The unikonts have a triple-gene fusion that is lacking in the bikonts. The three genes code for enzymes which make pyrimidine nucleotides. This must have involved a double gene fusion, a rare pair of events, which supports the shared ancestry of Opisthokonta and Amoebozoa.

Samudaya sacca is the second of the four noble truths in Buddhism. It is about the origins of dukkha (suffering).
"Samudaya" has many meanings, but it usually means "origin" or "source." "Sacca" means "truth" or "reality." So because of this, "Samudaya sacca" means "truth of the origin of suffering."

Rhizaria

The Rhizaria are a supergroup of mostly unicellular eukaryotes. A multicellular form has recently been described.
This supergroup was proposed by Cavalier-Smith in 2002. It has many species. They vary considerably in form, but for the most part they are amoeba-like with pseudopods. Many produce shells or skeletons, which may be quite complex in structure. They make up the vast majority of protozoan fossils. Nearly all have mitochondria with folds.
There are three main groups of Rhizaria:
Rhizaria is part of the bikont clade, which also comprises the Archaeplastida, the Chromalveolata, the Excavata, and some smaller, groups. As bikonts, they all descend from a heterotrophic eukaryote with two flagella.
Historically, many rhizarians were considered animals, with their movement and heterotrophy as justification. However, when the five-kingdom system took prevalence over the animal-plant dichotomy, the rhizarians were put into the kingdom Protista. Then, after Carl Woese published his three-domain system, taxonomists turned their attention to the eukaryote domain. The protists are paraphyletic, so needed to be split into monophyletic clades. After much debate, which continues to this day, Rhizaria emerged as one of those monophyletic groups.

Professional wrestling aerial techniques

This page describes the different types of aerial attacks in professional wrestling.
A diving crossbody is a move where a wrestler performs a type of crossbody off of the top turnbuckle and onto a standing opponent.
A diving DDT is a move where a wrestler who is on higher ground (usually the top rope) is facing either a standing or bent-over opponent. The wrestler dives wraps their near arm around the opponent's head in a front facelock and swings themselves backwards in midair, performing a DDT.
A diving double axe handle (also known as diving axe handle, diving double axe handle smash or diving double sledge) is a move where a wrestler jumps from the top turnbuckle to either the mat or floor and hits their opponent with two fists that are held together in the fashion of holding an axe.
A diving elbow drop is a move where a wrestler jumps from the top turnbuckle and lands on a downed opponent with their cocked elbow. There is also a less common version called the diving back elbow drop, where a wrestler climbs to the top turnbuckle, jumps backwards, cocks their elbow and lands their elbow on the opponent. The diving elbow drop was popularized by "Macho Man" Randy Savage who used it as his finisher. CM Punk adopted the moved as a tribute to Savage after he died.
A pointed elbow drop is a move where a wrestler that is sitting on the top turnbuckle, jumps while clasping their forearms together, and lands on their knees, while driving both elbows into either the shoulder or chest of their opponent.
A diving fist drop is a move where a wrestler jumps from the top turnbuckle onto the opponent and drives their fist into either the opponent's chest or head. 
A diving headbutt happens when a wrestler jumps from either the top rope or turnbuckle and lands anywhere on the opponent's body. Harley Race accidentally invented the move. The move was popularized by The Dynamite Kid and later by Chris Benoit. It was later found out that the move could cause spinal damage and was blamed as a contributing factor for the damage that was found in Chris Benoit's brain after his double-murder suicide.
A flying clothesline is a move where a wrestler jumps from either the top rope, top turnbuckle or somewhere else and performs a clothesline onto their standing opponent. 
A flying neckbreaker is a type of neckbreaker where the wrestler jumps from a higher position, usually the second turnbuckle, grbas the opponents neck in midair and takes them down with a neckbreaker. A common version of this is called the flip neckbreaker slam or Blockbuster when a wrestler does a somersault, and while flipping, catches the opponents head which ends in a neckbreaker slam.
A Frankensteiner is a type of hurricanrana that is done when the opponent is sitting on the top turnbuckle. While facing them, the wrestler performing the move wraps their legs around the opponent's head, does a backflip to swing through the opponent's open legs and drags them into a forced somersault which distances the wrestler from the opponent, who lands on his or her back. The name Frankensteiner comes from Scott Steiner, who popularized the move.
There is a different version called the reverse frankensteiner, also known as the inverted frankensteiner. The move is performed when an opponent is facing the other way while sitting on the top turnbuckle. The wrestler then performs the frankensteiner but the opponent lands on their chest instead.
A moonsault happens when a wrestler does a backflip and lands on their opponent. It is usually performed from the top turnbuckle. 
A 630° senton is a move where a wrestler does a senton and flips 630 degrees forward before landing. A corkscrew can be added. In a corkscrew version, the wrestler faces away from the ring and is on the top turnbuckle, they then perform a 180° turn in mid-air and perform a 630° senton onto a lying opponent.
A shiranui is a move where a wrestler puts their opponent in a three-quarter facelock, runs up the corner turnbuckles, jumps backwards, does a backflip in the air and lands face down on the mat, driving the opponent back first on the mat. There is a standing version and a "sitout shiranui" where the wrestler lands in a seated position and drives the opponent's head between their legs. It is the finishing move of Brian Kendrick who calls it the "Sliced Bread #2". The move was invented by Naomichi Marufuji.
A shooting star is when a wrestler jumps forward from higher ground and performs a backflip in midair. The most common technique of the shooting star is the shooting star press.
A shooting star press is a move where the wrestler jumps forward, presses their knees to their chest, does a backflip in midair and lands on their opponent chest first. A corkscrew version has also been used where the wrestler either a 180°, 360° or more in midair and lands in either a senton or press. The move was invented by Jushin "Thunder" Liger.
A shooting star leg drop is a move where the wrestler jumps forward from higher ground, does a backflip in midair, continues the rotation (by either doing a full 360° or more rotation) and lands on the downed opponent with their leg. 
A shooting star elbow drop is a move where the wrestler jumps forward from higher ground, does a backflip in midair, and lands on the downed opponent with their elbow.
A shooting star DDT is a move where the wrestler jumps forward from higher ground, does a backflip in midair, catches the standing opponent and performs a DDT on the way down. 
A shooting star senton is a move where the wrestler jumps forward from higher ground, does a backflip in midair, and continues the rotation (by either doing a full 360° or more rotation) and adds another 90 which ends in a senton.
A corkscrew shooting star press is a move where the wrestler jumps forward from higher ground, twists and flips backwards at the same time, and hits a shooting star press. Pac/Adrian Neville uses the move as his finisher which he calls the "Red Arrow".
A sunset flip is a pinning move performed when a wrestler is on higher ground. The wrestler then dives over the opponent, catches them in a waist-lock from behind and rolls them into a sitting position when they hit the mat. When the wrestler rolls over the opponent, they pull the opponent backwards and land their back into a pinning position. 
Some of the moves that are done are not meant to pin an opponent or weaken them. They are used to set up another attack on an opponent.
A springboard is when a wrestler bounces themself upward off of a rope into a move. There is also a double springboard where a wrestler bounces off one rope and onto another. Some moves that can be done from a springboard position are a springboard dropkick, springboard legdrop and a springboard moonsault.
A slingshot is when a wrestler, who is standing on the ring apron, pulls the top rope and uses the momentum that is gained to hurl themself over the rope and into the ring.
A corkscrew is when a wrestler twists themself in the air. It can also refer to when a wrestler does a backflip but it is twisted so the wrestler faces the inside of the ring instead of the outside when the move ends. 
A Plancha is the name in American wrestling for when a wrestler performs a slingshot crossbody to an opponent on the outside of the ring. In lucha libre, it is called a Pescado when a wrestler uses the top ring rope for the slingshot. 
A ropewalk is when a wrestler walks across the top rope before performing a move. The Undertaker uses a ropewalk in his "Old School" signature move.
the name "suicide" or "suicida" is used before any move that wrestler uses which goes either from the ring, the ring apron, or the turnbuckles to the outside of the ring. The most common move is the "suicide dive" or "topé suicida" where a wrestler jumps through the ring ropes to the opponent on the outside. Sometimes a front flip is used after the wrestler leaps through the ropes, this is known as "suicide senton" or "Topé con Hilo".

Live Forever

"Live Forever" is the third single off English rock band Oasis' debut studio album "Definitely Maybe". The song was released on 8 August 1994. 
The song was written by Noel Gallagher in 1991 before he joined Oasis. "Live Forever" was inspired by The Rolling Stones song "Shine a Light". It featured an optimistic outlook which differed from the attitude of the grunge bands which were popular at that time. Noel Gallagher presented a fully composed "Live Forever" to the band for the first time in early 1993 during their rehearsals. According to drummer Tony McCarroll, the band were awed by it. The demo version of the song begins with an acoustic guitar intro. While recording the album version, the producer Owen Morris cut out the intro and replaced it with a drumbeat that was played by McCarroll. Morris further cut a second section in Gallagher's guitar solo. Although Gallagher was upset, Morris felt the part had sounded "a bit like fucking Slash from Guns N' Roses".
The song is understood to be an ode to Noel and Liam Gallagher's mother Peggy.In general, the lyrics to the song stress an optimistic outlook. Noel Gallagher explained that "At the time . . . it was written in the middle of grunge and all that, and I remember Nirvana had a tune called 'I Hate Myself and Want to Die', and I was like . . . 'Well, I'm not fucking having that.' As much as I fucking like him (Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain) and all that shit, I'm not having that. I can't have people like that coming over here, on smack, fucking saying that they hate themselves and they wanna die. That's fucking rubbish. Kids don't need to be hearing that nonsense." While Gallagher said that he did not intend "Live Forever" as a direct reply to Nirvana or their music (being a professed fan of the band), he differed the lives of Cobain and his band at that point, saying, "Seems to me that here was a guy who had everything, and was miserable about it. And we had fuck-all, and I still thought that getting up in the morning was the greatest fuckin' thing ever, 'cause you didn't know where you'd end up at night. And we didn't have a pot to piss in, but it was fucking great, man". Gallagher says that the line "We see things they'll never see" is the most important line of the song and explained that old friends tend to laugh at jokes and stories that "no one else gets".

Melanocyte

Melanocytes are melanin-producing cells. They are most obvious in the skin, hair and eyes. They are in the bottom layer of the skin's epidermis, in hairs, and in the iris of the eye, and some places inside the body. 
Melanin is the pigment mostly responsible for skin and hair colour. It protects the skin against damage by UV radiation from the Sun. UV radiation causes damage to cell DNA, which makes skin cancer more likely. 
Melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH) from the pituitary gland causes melanocytes to produce more melanin. They stimulate the production and release of melanin by melanocytes in skin and hair. MSH signals to the brain have effects on appetite and sexual arousal.

<doc id="456403" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=456403" title="Human skin colour">
Human skin colour

Human skin colour is one of the most easily seen features of a person. It ranges in variety from the darkest brown to the lightest pinkish-white. Skin colour is inherited and is the result of natural selection. Skin pigmentation in human beings evolved mainly to control the amount of ultraviolet radiation penetrating the skin, thus reducing its effects.
The single most important substance deciding human skin colour is the pigment melanin. Melanin is produced within the skin by cells called melanocytes. The red colour underlying the skin becomes more visible in white skin, especially in the face. In physical exercise or the stimulation of the nervous system (anger, fear), blood vessels expand.
There is a direct relationship between UV radiation (UVR) and the distribution of indigenous skin pigmentation around the world. Areas that have more UVR also have darker-skinned populations. Areas that are far from the tropics and closer to the poles have lower concentration of UVR, and lighter-skinned populations. Human populations have changed from dark-skinned to light-skinned as they left Africa about 100,000 years ago, and some have changed back to darker skin as they returned to higher UV zones. 
Natural skin colour can also darken as a result of tanning due to exposure to sunlight. The leading theory is that skin colour adapts to intense sunlight to provide partial protection against the ultraviolet fraction which damages DNA of the skin cells and so produces mutations. 
It is easy to see why dark skin is an advantage in the tropics as a partial defence against skin cancer. It is much less easy to see why a white skin is an advantage in colder climates. Researchers have suggested two reasons, and both probably play a part. The first is that, at a given temperature, a white skin radiates less heat than a black skin. The second is that in weaker sunlight the body tends to produce less vitamin D. There is a hypothesis that the selection for lighter skin is due to the need for higher vitamin D production. The change started as soon as populations moved north out of Africa. 
In addition, adult human females are usually lighter in skin pigmentation than males. Females need more calcium during pregnancy and lactation. The body synthesizes vitamin D from the action of sunlight on the skin. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium. Females evolved to have lighter skin so their bodies absorb more calcium. 
The social significance of differences in skin color has varied across cultures and over time, as demonstrated with regard to social status and discrimination.

The band started out as a cover band and went by the name Fozzy Osbourne, a play on the name of the singer Ozzy Osbourne. The band was assembled by Rich Ward from whatever musicians that he could find in a given week. In 1999, Ward met Jericho in San Antonio, Texas after a wrestling show and he invited Jericho to play with the band. 
In 2000, after Jericho suffered a severe ankle injury and was unable to wrestle for four moths, he rejoined the band and became their front man. He went under the persona of Moongoose McQueen.

When he was interviewed as Moongoose, he stayed in character the entire time and feigned ignorance of who Chris Jericho was. On the other side, Chris Jericho was a "huge fan" of both Moongoose and Fozzy.
Fozzy started production on their first album later on. On October 24, 2000, Fozzy released their first, self-titled studio album. The album featured covers of songs songs from bands like Dio, Krokus, Twisted Sister, Iron Maiden, Mötley Crüe and Judas Priest.

Roman invasion of Britain

The Roman conquest of Britain began in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius. His general Aulus Plautius became first Governor of Roman Britain (). 
Britain had been the target of invasions by the Roman Republic and Roman Empire. It had diplomatic and trading links with the Romans after Julius Caesar's expeditions in 55 and 54 BC. Roman economic and cultural influence was already part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age, in the south.
Between 55 BC and the 40s AD, Britain was not invaded. Augustus prepared invasions in 34 BC, 27 BC and 25 BC. The first and third were called off due to revolts elsewhere in the empire, the second because the Britons seemed ready to come to terms. Strabo's "Geography", written during this period, says that Britain paid more in customs and duties than could be raised by taxation if the island were conquered.
By the 40s AD, the political situation in Britain was apparently in some chaos. Caligula planned a campaign against the Britons in 40, but it never happened. Caligula's preparations made Claudius' invasion possible three years later. For example, Caligula built a lighthouse at (modern Boulogne-sur-Mer) that provided a model for the one built soon after at Dover.

Corduroy

Corduroy is a strong fabric. It is made of twisted fibers. When woven, the fibers are parallel to one another in ridges. This makes the corduroy look striped. Corduroy is used to make clothing, including trousers, jackets and shirts. It is also used for furniture, including couches..
The ridges in the fabric are called "wales". Corduroy can have from 1.5 to 21 wales per inch. It usually has between 10 and 12 wales per inch. Corduroy with fewer wales per inch is more often used to make trousers and for furniture. Corduroy with more wales per inch is usually used for clothing worn above the waist.
Some people think the word "corduroy" comes from the French words "corde du roi" ("the cord of the King"). There is no evidence that this is true.
Other names are used for corduroy. Some of those names are corded velveteen, elephant cord, pin cord, Manchester cloth and cords.
In continental Europe, corduroy is often called "Manchester" or "Cord".

Hell Awaits

Hell Awaits is the second studio album by American thrash metal band, Slayer. "Hell Awaits" was released in March 1985. The album was released through Metal Blade Records.
"Hell Awaits" features Slayer's most progressive and diverse work compared to their older releases. According to guitarist Kerry King, he and Jeff Hanneman were into Mercyful Fate at that time and that led them to do longer and more progressive songs.
To promote the album, the band took part in the Combat Tour with Venom and Exodus. Exodus guitarist Gary Holt commented, "We immediately bonded with the Slayer guys. It was two bands of friends playing with one band of heroes, you know? We were just star-struck." Gary Holt later joined the band in 2015.

Interface

An interface is what the user uses on an operating system to make the computer do tasks, like writing a document, or loading a web page. There are two types of interfaces, a command line interface (CLI for short), or a graphical user interface (GUI for short).
"See Command line interface."
Command line interfaces ask the user to type in commands in a text-based environment, not allowing images, like the screen image to the right.
For example, if the user wanted the computer to say "Hello World", he or she would:
This is hard to use for most people, mostly because when the user has to do a long command, he or she can miss a letter or two, so the computer shows an error, and he or she has to do it all over again, which can waste hours.
"See Graphical user interface."
Graphical user interfaces are instead made of not only text, but also images. The first computer to do this was the Apple Lisa (1983).
The following operating systems can use graphical user interfaces:
Since the top operating systems (listed above) use graphical user interfaces, they are seen on every computer. Anyone can still use a command line interface on any computer very easily.

South of Heaven

South of Heaven is the fourth studio album by American thrash metal band, Slayer. "South of Heaven" was released on July 5, 1988. The album was released through Def Jam. It is the second collaboration with record producer Rick Rubin.
The album is their second to enter the Billboard 200 and was their last album that was released under Def Jam Recordings. Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has said that the album was the only album that the band members had discussed before writing the music. They knew that they "couldn't top Reign in Blood", and that whatever they recorded would be "compared to that album", he believed they "had to slow down", something the band had never done on albums before, or since.
Guitarist Kerry King mentioned the need to "keep people guessing" as another reason for the musical shift. According to Slayer's official biography: "In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole". "They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums."

"My Plague" is the third single off American metal band Slipknot's second studio album "Iowa". The song was released on July 8, 2002. 
There was a remix for the song called "New Abuse Mix" that was featured on the soundtrack to the 2002 movie "Resident Evil". the remix cut a screamed layer of vocals and replaced it with a more monotone, drone-like sounding layer. The new version was cut by approximately 00:37 seconds by removing the transitional ""Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you" section. Some of the profanities were also replaced with less offensive phrases; like the phrase "...the everyday bullshit things that you have done" was changed to, "...the everyday abusive things that you have done" and "You fucking touch me, I will rip you apart..." was replaced with "...and if you touch me, I will rip you apart..."". The whole second verse of the chorus was removed.
In 2003, the song was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Metal Performance category but it lost to Korn's "Here to Stay".

Pelagornis

Pelagornis is a genus of huge fossil birds. One species, "P. sandersi", is one of the largest bird ever found. Its wingspan was twice that of the largest Albatross. Its wingspan is estimated as about 6.4 to 7.4 metres. The fossil of this particular species is from the Oligocene stage, about 25 million years ago (mya).
Pelagornithids are an extinct group of birds known for bony tooth-like beak projections, large size, and highly modified wing bones. There are many questions about their ecology. The bird was capable of highly efficient gliding. That suggests it had a long-range marine soaring life-style similar to that of living albatrosses.
Several later species have been found, and they are not quite so large. The whole group died out about three million years ago.

Pyrrharctia isabella

The Isabella tiger moth ("Pyrrharctia isabella") lives in cold northern regions, especially the Arctic. 
Its caterpillar, the banded woolly bear larva, overwinters. It literally freezes solid. It produces a body fluid which helps its tissues to avoid damage. In the spring it thaws out and emerges to eat and grow in the short Arctic summer.
In temperate climates, many moths go through one generation in a year. In the Arctic the summer period is so short that the Woolly Bear must feed for several summers. Each winter it freezes, until at last it can pupate. Some are known to live through as many as 14 winters.
Once it emerges from its pupa as a moth it has only days to find a mate.

The law's signing was met with widespread criticism by people and groups who felt the law was carefully worded in a way that would permit discrimination against LGBT persons.
As of March 2016, Pence has attempted unsuccessfully to prevent Syrian refugees from being resettled in Indiana.
Pence is running for a second term as governor. He was unopposed in the May 3, 2016, Republican primary for governor. He faces Democrat John Gregg, former Speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives, in a rematch of the 2012 race. Early reports on July 14 suggest Pence is likely to be announced as the VP candidate on July 15. If he becomes Trump's running mate, Pence said he would drop out of the governor race.
In July 2016, Trump said that there was three people on his running mate shortlist: Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich and Pence himself. On July 14, 2016, it was reported that Trump selected Pence as his running mate. On July 15, 2016, Trump announced on his Twitter that Pence would be his running mate. He made a formal announcement in New York City on July 16, 2016.
Trump would go on to defeat Clinton in the general election making Pence the Vice President-elect of the United States.
Pence was inaugurated as the 48th Vice President of the United States after being sworn in by Associate Justice Clarence Thomas on January 20, 2017.
Pence and his wife Karen Pence have been married since 1985. They have three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey. Pence is a born-again Christian.

Elsa (Disney)

Elsa is the Queen of Arendelle in the Disney movie "Frozen". For most of the movie, she is voiced by singer and actress Idina Menzel. However, "Young Elsa" is voiced by Eva Bella, and "Teen Elsa" is voiced by Spencer Lacey Ganus. Elsa has a sister named Anna who is younger than her.
Elsa was born with magic powers. She freezes everything that she touches. When she can't control them, she shuts herself away from everyone.
This is what the Official Frozen Website says about Elsa:
"From the outside, Elsa (voice of Idina Menzel) looks poised, regal and reserved, but in reality, she lives in fear as she wrestles with a mighty secret."
Elsa is based on the main character of the story The Snow Queen. In the movie, Elsa is born with ice powers and hurts her sister Anna, causing her parents to lock her up in her room for her young life. Elsa's parents die, and Elsa becomes the queen, but escapes to finally have freedom for herself and avoid hurting people with her ice powers. When Elsa accidentally freezes the kingdom, she flees to a far-off mountain. Anna goes after her sister.
Elsa was the hardest character Disney had ever made. For example, a normal person has 100,000 hairs on his head, but Elsa has 420,000 hairs on her head.
Elsa's song "Let It Go" received many positive reviews from viewers and critics.

Megacheira

Megacheira ("great hands") is an extinct class of predatory arthropods. They had a pair of short enlarged appendages at the front. They look like early chelicerates. 
Most of them lived in marine environments round the world from the lower to middle Cambrian. It looks like they were quite common then. However, one perfectly preserved specimen of "Enalikter" was found in the Silurian of Herefordshire (England). Another species ("Bundenbachiellus") was found in the early Devonian of Germany.

He is best known for his 14-year tenure with Pro Wrestling Noah. During his time in Pro Wrestling Noah, Kobayashi is a former one-time GHC Heavyweight Champion, three-time GHC Junior Heavyweight and one-time GHC Tag Team Champion. He also won the 2012 Global League and the 2013 Global Tag League tournaments. He was also one half of the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions twice; his first reign was the inaugural reign with his longtime tag partner and rival, Naomichi Marufuji, which saw the two hold the title for almost two years. His second reign was with his protégé, Taiji Ishimori. He first wrestled under his real name, but because of potential confusion with his mentor, Kenta Kobashi (in both English and Japanese), he decided to drop his surname and only use his given name. He also spells his ring name with Roman letters in all capitals.
On January 27, 2014, he did a tryout at WWE's Performance Center in Orlando, Florida with Noah's blessing. In a press release, he said that he was not looking for a WWE contract but he only wanted to fulfill a dream that he had to take part in a WWE workout. On June 27, 2014, it was reported by Tokyo Sports that Kenta had signed with the WWE. During WWE's July 12, 2014 event in Osaka, they announced that they had signed Kenta during an in-ring segment with Hulk Hogan. Kenta will go to Orlando, Florida to continue training at the Performance Center and also work for WWE's developmental territory "NXT".
He debuted at "NXT Takeover: Fatal 4-Way" on September 11, 2014. He was introduced by William Regal. During his debut, he announced that his new ring name would be Hideo Itami, meaning "Hero of Pain". He would then fend off The Ascension after they interrupted the segment to confront Regal.
Itami would make his in-ring debut on the September 18 episode of "NXT", defeating Justin Gabriel. After his match, he was attacked by The Ascension. He would continue to engage The Ascension in brawls but he would end up on the losing side due to the numbers advantage. On the November 6 episode, Itami revealed his tag partner as the debuting Finn Bálor.

House of La Tour d'Auvergne

The House of La Tour d'Auvergne was a French noble family. They had great power and wealth during the 17th and 18th century in France. The family claimed to rule the Duchy of Bouillon from the year of 1456. The duchy was later ceded to France on 26 October 1795. The family had apartments at the Palace of Versailles and a grand townhouse in Paris (now destroyed). The family were notoriously arrogant. They schemed to marry their children well. They tried to gain favour with the royal family of the time. The duchy came into the family through the marriage of Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne to Charlotte de La Marck who was a duchess in her own right. The family also claimed to be the sovereign rulers of the Principality of Sedan. The family used several lesser titles such as titles of Duke of Albret and Duke of Château-Thierry from 1651. They held the rank of "Foreign Princes" at Versailles. As such, they were entitled to use the style of "Highness".
The dukes were usually addressed by the style of "Serene Highness". 
Jacques Léopold was the last Duke of Bouillon, and following the Napoleonic Wars the duchy was absorbed into the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

He was sentenced to death "in absentia" in France in 1954 for crimes against humanity. In 1961 and in 1980, Brunner lost an eye and the fingers of his left hand, as a result of letter bombs sent to him by the Israeli Mossad.
In 2003, the Guardian described him as "the world's highest-ranking Nazi fugitive believed still alive". Brunner was last reported to be living in Syria, whose government had long refused international efforts to locate or apprehend him.

Xcelerator

Xcelerator is a steel launched roller coaster that was built by Intamin, and is located at Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, California.
After the riders have been loaded onto the train at the station, the train is first hooked up to a catch car that is under the train. The train has to move back to hook onto the catch car in order to launch. After 2.3 seconds, the train is released from the catch car, and travels at a speed of from the station. The train then travels over a tower, or top hat element, and after that it travels through a 110 ft over banked turn, and then a 95 ft over banked turn before coming to a smooth stop over magnetic brakes.
Sometimes, a train does not have enough speed to make it over the top hat element. If that happens, a train tries to go up the tower, stop, then roll back to the station. This is called a shortshot, and it is part of the ride's design. A shortshot can cause the ride to be closed for a period of time while the ride is reset and tested several times before it can be opened again. Rain, weight, the number of time its launched, the outside temperature, and overheating can cause a shortshot.
Xcelerator will not operate in the rain so that a shortshot does not happen when the launch track is wet. Then the track needs to dry until it is safe to test the roller coaster. This happens so that a shortshot does not happen.

Programmed learning

Programmed learning (or 'programmed instruction') is a research-based system which helps learners work successfully. The method is guided by research done by a variety of applied psychologists and educators.
The learning material is in a kind of textbook or teaching machine or computer. The medium presents the material in a logical and tested sequence. The text is in small steps or larger chunks. After each step, learners are given a question to test their comprehension. Then immediately the correct answer is shown. This means the learner at all stages makes responses, and is given immediate knowledge of results.
It is rather interesting that Edward L. Thorndike wrote in 1912:
"If, by a miracle of mechanical ingenuity, a book could be so arranged that only to him who had done what was directed on page one would page two become visible, and so on, much that now requires personal instruction could be managed by print". 
Thorndike, however, did nothing with his idea. The first such system was devised by Sidney L. Pressey in 1926. "The first.. [teaching machine] was developed by Sidney L. Pressey... While originally developed as a self-scoring machine... [it] demonstrated its ability to actually teach".
In World War II, with largely conscript armies, there was great emphasis on training. What was learnt influenced education and training after the war. One of the main methods was the use of film as a group training method. Research on the effectiveness of training films was done extensively. In one account, Lumsdaine comments that research on films went on "from about 1918 to the present" (meaning 1962). 
A few conclusions stood out from the research. One was that films were great at giving overviews of a situation or an operation. However, they were less successful at getting over the details. Some general features of film (and, later, television) stand out. One is that a film goes at its own pace. Another is that no specific responses or activities are required from the viewer. A third is that the audience is varied, sometimes hugely varied. This gives clues to ways of improving instructional films.
In a 1946 experiment at Yale University, questions for students were put between segments of a film on the heart and circulation, with correct answers given after students had responded (knowledge of results). This added significantly to the amount learnt from the film. Lumsdaine commented that even showing the basic film twice was not so effective as showing the version with questions and answers. 
The connections between this experiment and those of Pressey were obvious. Active responses by learners and helpful feedback on the activities were now seen as critical elements in any successful system of learning. Pressey's work had been half forgotten, but it was now recognised as significant.
If so much research had already been done on learning from films, what exactly did programmed learning add? The short answer is "stimulus control", by which is broadly meant the teaching material itself. Also, in programmed learning, a complete system was proposed which included these stages: 
A helpful discussion of the different programming techniques was given by Klaus.
Although there were three or four other systems proposed, we discuss here the two best-known methods.
One was by Norman Crowder, a psychologist with the U.S. Air Force. He had been asked to investigate the training of aircraft maintenance men. Crowder's system was to set multiple choice questions in the text, and provide feedback for each of the alternatives. Examples of this method show that the alternatives offered in questions were chosen to cover mistakes which students were likely to make.
Much better known was the other style of programmed learning, as proposed by the behaviourist B.F. Skinner. Skinner made some very effective criticisms of traditional teaching methods. His scheme of programmed instruction was to present the material as part of a "schedule of reinforcement" in typical behaviourist manner. The programmed text of Skinner's theory of behaviorism is the most complete example of his ideas in action. Skinner was a wonderful publicist for his own ideas, as can be seen from this passage:
Both methods were originally presented in machines, and both were later presented in book form. Both systems were to an extent student centered. They were ways of teaching individual learners who worked at their own pace. Both systems (in different ways) used knowledge of results to promote learning. In both systems the content was pre-tested to identify problems and iron them out. Both systems emphasised clear learning objectives. Progress in learning was measured by pre- and post-tests of equivalent difficulty. Many practical tests showed the effectiveness of these methods. 
Many of these ideas were picked up and used in other educational fields, such as open learning (see the Open University) and computer-assisted learning.

Sidney L. Pressey

Sidney L. Pressey (Brooklyn, New York, 1888 1979) was Professor of Psychology at Ohio State University for many years. He is famous for having invented a teaching machine many years before the idea became popular.
Pressey joined Ohio State in 1921, and stayed there until he retired in 1959. He continued publishing after retirement, with 18 papers between 1959 and 1967. He was a cognitive psychologist who "rejected a view of learning as an accumulation of responses governed by environmental stimuli in favor of one governed by meaning, intention, and purpose". In fact, he had been a cognitive psychologist his entire life, well before the "mythical birthday of the cognitive revolution in psychology".
Pressey was the first winner of the E.L. Thorndike Award for achievements in educational technology, in 1964. This is an award of the American Psychological Association.
In 1923, Pressey and a co-worker published the first reading ease formula. They had been concerned that science textbooks in junior high school had so many technical words. They felt that teachers spent all class time explaining their meaning. They argued that their formula would help to measure and reduce the “vocabulary burden” of textbooks. Their formula, based on the Thorndike word list, took three hours to apply to a single book. It was a measure of vocabulary difficulty. Many later formulae made use of some measure of sentence complexity as well as vocabulary. These are the two main causes of text difficulty or 'readability'.
Pressey's idea started as a machine for administering multiple-choice questions to students. These were (and are still) a basic method for testing students in the U.S.A.. The machine had a window with a question and four answers. The student pressed the key to the chosen answer. The machine recorded the answer on a counter to the back of the machine, and showed the next question.
The great idea was to fix the machine so that it would not move on until the student chose the right answer. Then it was easy to show that the second arrangement taught the students what were the right answers. This was the first demonstartion that a machine could teach, and also a demonstration that knowledge of results was the cause of the learning.
A number of reviews credit Pressey with being the founder of programmed learning and teaching machines, long before the better known efforts of B.F. Skinner. Skinner was, however, responsible for bringing the whole subject into popular view, and his critique of the limitations of traditional classroom teaching is a classic work.

Polar climate

Polar climate has temperatures below for much of the year. According to the Köppen climate classification, a polar climate is one in which no monthly average goes above . If the temperature is between and in the warmest month, it is a tundra climate. If the average temperature is below in the warmest month, it is an ice cap climate. These climates are found near the poles and on high mountains. There is usually little precipitation because the air is so dry. Ice cap climates are in the Arctic Ocean, Greenland, Iceland, Antarctica and at high altitude.
About 20% of the Earth has a polar climate.

Teaching machine

Teaching machines were originally mechanical devices. They presented educational materials and taught students. They were first invented by Sidney L. Pressey. His machine originally administered multiple-choice questions. When the machine was set so it moved on only when the student got the right answer, tests showed that learning had taken place. Much later, Norman Crowder developed the Pressey idea much further.
B.F. Skinner was responsible for a different type of machine which used his ideas on how learning should be directed with positive reinforcement. 
There is extensive experience that both methods worked well, and so did programmed learning in other forms, such as books.
The ideas of teaching machines and programmed learning provided the basis for later ideas such as open learning and computer-assisted instruction.

A Prairie Home Companion

A Prairie Home Companion is a live radio variety show created and hosted by Garrison Keillor. The show runs on Saturdays from 5 to 7 pm Central Time. It is usually broadcast from the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul, Minnesota. The program is also taken on the road. "A Prairie Home Companion" is known for its musical guests, especially folk and traditional musicians. It is also known for its tongue-in-cheek humor and Keillor's storytelling segment, "News from Lake Wobegon".
The radio program inspired a 2006 film of the same name, written by Keillor, directed by Robert Altman, and featuring Keillor, Lily Tomlin, Meryl Streep, Lindsay Lohan, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Kline, John C. Reilly, and Woody Harrelson.
"A Prairie Home Companion" started as a morning show, running from 6 to 9 am on Minnesota Public Radio. The first program aired on 6 July 1974 before an audience of 12 people. The idea for the name came from a cemetery in Moorhead, Minnesota called the Prairie Home. It was located across the street from the radio station.
In April of 1974, Keillor traveled to Nashville. This was the last broadcast of the Grand Ole Opry from the old Ryman Auditorium and Keillor was doing a story for The New Yorker Magazine. He decided to host a variety show based on that format on the radio. On July 6, 1974, the first live broadcast of "A Prairie Home Companion" took place.
In 1978, the show moved into the World Theater in Saint Paul, Minnesota. In 1987, he decided to move to Denmark with his new wife. He then moved to New York City. In 1989 he began a new show "The American Radio Company of the Air." The format was the same, but the program was geared to the New York audience. But after four seasons he moved back to Minnesota and brought back the Prairie Home Companion.
In 1985, the program was taped for audiences in Australia and Sweden. In 1990 digital tapes were rebroadcast in Tiwan. By 1995 the program was rebroadcast in numerous countries via satellite.
Music is a main feature of the program. It includes many different kinds of music, including country, bluegrass, blues, and gospel. The program also has guest performers from a wide variety of other styles of music, including classical, opera and music from a number of different countries.
One of the show's best-known features is Keillor's "News from Lake Wobegon". This is a weekly storytelling monologue, claiming to be a report from Keillor's fictitious hometown of Lake Wobegon. The segment always begins with "It's been a quiet week in Lake Woebegone, my hometown." It almost always ends with "And that's the news from Lake Woebegone, where all the women are handsome, all the men are strong, and all the children are above average."
Because the program is aired on public broadcasting radio, they are not allowed to have real advertisements. Instead, the show produces fictional advertisements for fictional products. The ads are performed in the style of live old-time radio commercials. The show is "sponsored" by fictitious products including "Powdermilk Biscuits", "Cafe Boeuf" and the "American Duct Tape Council".
The program recently celebrated its 40th year.

Chipko Movement

The Chipko movement or Chipko Andolan is a movement that practiced the Gandhianmethods of satyagraha and non-violent resistance. This is mainly done through the act of hugging trees to protect them from being cut down. This was first started by Amrita Devi while protesting against a King's men to cut the tree. The modern Chipko movement began in the early 1970s in the Garhwal Himalayas of Uttarakhand. It spread to Uttar Pradesh with a growing awareness of rapid deforestation. The landmark event in this struggle took place on March 26, 1974. This is when a group of peasant women in Reni village, Hemwalghati, in Chamoli district, Uttarakhand, India, acted to prevent the cutting of trees by the contractors assigned by the state Forest Department. Their actions inspired hundreds of such actions at the grassroots level throughout the region. By the 1980s the movement had spread throughout India. This led to the formulation of people-sensitive forest policies, which put a stop to the open felling of trees in regions as far as the Vindhyas and the Western Ghats.

A Confederate army commanded by Jubal Early was marching eastward towards Washington, D.C., to capture the city. A small Union army commanded by Lew Wallace fought the Confederates along the Monocacy River. The battle took most of the day to fight. The Confederates finally made Wallace's force retreat about 4:30 p.m. However, the delay kept the Confederates from reaching Washington until General Grant's soldiers reached the city. The Battle of Monocacy is sometimes called "the battle that saved Washington".

The Fitzgerald Theater is the oldest active theatre in Saint Paul, Minnesota. It is the home of American Public Media's "A Prairie Home Companion". The theater is owned by Minnesota Public Radio. The Fitzgerald was also the location for the 2006 film of the same name.
It was built in 1910 at a cost of $165,000. It had a sandstone front and was of concrete and steel construction. The theatre had several very modern features for its time. It had 2,000 electric light bulbs. The stage could be lowered and raised by two feet. It had 16 dressing rooms and a side entrance for those arriving in automobiles. It was one of many theaters built by the Shubert Theatre Corporation. It was originally named the Sam S. Shubert Theater. The theatre was designed by the noted Chicago architectural firm of Marshall and Fox.
By 1933 it had fallen on hard times. Even the Broadway shows that played there could not make it profitable. That same year it was remodeled in the Art Deco style and renamed the World Theatre. It became a movie theatre and specialized in showing foreign films. By 1978 it was scheduled to be torn down. Minnesota Public Radio was looking for a new home for one of it's programs, A Prairie Home Companion. They were able to lease the theatre for a very reasonable price. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 as the Sam S. Shubert Theatre and Shubert Building. In 1985 it was decided the building was unsafe and was in danger of closing permanently. After raising nearly two million dollars, the building was once again renovated. In 1994 it was renamed after St. Paul native F. Scott Fitzgerald.
In 2005, the theater was used for filming the movie "A Prairie Home Companion", directed by Robert Altman. Garrison Keillor, the star of the radio show also starred in the movie. He was instrumental in getting Hollywood stars such as Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin for the movie.
The movie was shot digitally which allowed the cast and crew to fit into the small building. Even the theatre's basement was used for movie sets. With all the actors, technicians, electricians and carpenters squeezed into a small space, it was "as crowded as an ant farm". A Hollywood-style premiere was held at the Fitzgerald on 3 May 2006. A parade led from Rice Park to the theatre and the red carpet was laid out for the stars who arrived in white horse-drawn carriages.

Oral rehydration therapy

Oral rehydration therapy is a treatment for dehydration: the sick person drinks water mixed with sugar and salt. They don't stop eathing food. There is a mixture that is used for severe dehydration: This mixture also includes zinc. Those who take care of the sick person are taught how they can see it if the dehydration gets worse. The World Health Organization and UNICEF specify indications, preparations and procedures for ORT.
The therapy was developed in the second half of the 20th century. It has helped lower the number of human deaths from dehydration in vomiting and diarrheal illnesses, especially in cholera epidemics occurring in children. It is sign for public health getting better all over the world. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.
Before ORT was used often, most of the children who died in developing nations, died from diarrhea. Between 1980 and 2006, the introduction of ORT is thought to have lowered the number of young children who died anywhere in the world from 5 to 3 million every year. However, in 2008, diarrhea is still the second most common cause of death in children under five years (17 percent), (after pneumonia (19 percent)). Moreover, by the same year, the use of ORT in children under five had declined.
WHO and UNICEF developed official guidelines for how to make ORS. Depending on what materials are available, they propose different alternative preparations. Commercial preparations are available as either pre-prepared fluids or packets of oral rehydration salts (ORS) ready for mixing with the fluid.
WHO/UNICEF's formula is salt (NaCal), trisodium citrate dihydrate , KCl, anhydrous glucose (formula_1) per litre of fluid. 
A basic oral rehydration therapy solution is composed of salt, sugar, and water in solution, made using a standard ratio and is appropriate for use in situations when ORS must be prepared without the standard ingredients. 
The Rehydration Project says that making it a bit too thin (using more than 1 liter of fluid) is not bad for the sick person. 
The best fluid is plain, clean water. However, fluids such as rice water, coconut water, vegetable broth, yogurt, weak unsweetened tea, unsweetened fresh fruit juice or even non-drinking water are recommended when plain, clean water is unavailable. Water can be made safe with chlorine, or by boiling it. However, ORS should still be given even if the water is maybe unsafe. Rehydration is more important. 
The molar ratio of sugar to salt should be 1:1 and the solution should not be hyperosmolar. The Mayo clinic suggests half a teaspoon of salt, six level teaspoons of sugar and water. The British Columbia health service suggests 1 part fruit juice without sugar, mixed with 4 parts water.

Assassination of Theo van Gogh

Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh was assassinated by Mohammed Bouyeri in Amsterdam East, Netherlands. He was murdered in broad daylight. Van Gogh's last words, according to eyewitnesses, were "Mercy mercy! We can talk about this!"
The murderer Mohammed Bouyeri killed van Gogh. The reason for murdering Gogh was to oppose the controversial film Submission. Bouyeri shot and stabbed van Gogh, then cut his throat. Finally the killer attached a 5 letter page to van Gogh's chest with a knife. Bouyeri was chased by Dutch police after shooting a bullet into Bouyeri's leg. Bouyeri was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Bouyeri stated, he doesn't have any regret for killing van Gogh. He termed the assassination as Jihad.
Van Gogh was buried in Amsterdam on 9 November, 2004. Van Gogh's son claimed that many assassination attempts were made but van Gogh refused to take police protection.
Sooner after van Gogh's assassination, Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Geert Wilders went into hiding. This is because Bouyeri made death threats against Hirsi as the writer of the film.
On 18 March 2007, a sculpture honoring van Gogh, entitled "De Schreeuw" ("The Scream"), was unveiled in Amsterdam. It is located in the Oosterpark, a short distance from where van Gogh was murdered.

"Paul is dead" is an urban legend and conspiracy theory suggesting that Paul McCartney of the English rock band the Beatles died in 1966 and was secretly replaced by a look-alike.
In September 1969, American college students published articles claiming that clues to McCartney's supposed death could be found among the lyrics and artwork of the Beatles' recordings. Rumours declined after a contemporary interview with McCartney was published in "Life" magazine in November 1969.
Popular culture continues to make occasional reference to the legend, and McCartney poked fun at it with a 1993 live album titled "Paul Is Live", whose cover parodied "clues" allegedly on the cover of the Beatles' "Abbey Road" album.
The legend is based on a range of ideas. One theory says that facial recognition proves that a different person "became" Paul after 1966. The "Abbey Road" cover clues include:

William Holman Hunt

William Holman Hunt OM (2 April 1827 – 7 September 1910) was an English painter, and one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood.
Hunt formed the Pre-Raphaelite movement in 1848, after meeting the poet and artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti. With John Everett Millais, they sought to revitalise art. They favoured the detailed observation of the natural world, in a spirit of devotion to thetruth. This almost religious approach was influenced by the spiritual qualities of mediaeval art. It was in opposition to the rationalism of the Renaissance, as in Raphael. 
Hunt's works were not successful at first, and were widely attacked in the art press. They were thought clumsy and ugly. All the same, his was noticed for the naturalistic scenes of modern rural and urban life, such as "The Hireling Shepherd" and "The Awakening Conscience". However, it was with his religious paintings that he became famous, initially "The Light of the World" (1851–1853), now in the chapel at Keble College, Oxford; a later version (1900) toured the world and now has its home in St Paul's Cathedral.
In the mid-1850s Hunt travelled to the Holy Land in search of material for more religious works, and to “use my powers to make more tangible Jesus Christ’s history and teaching”. there he painted "The Scapegoat", "The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple" and "The Shadow of Death", along with many landscapes of the region. Hunt also painted many works based on poems, such as "Isabella, or the Pot of Basil" and "The Lady of Shalott". He eventually built his own house in Jerusalem.
His auction record is £1,700,000, set at Sotheby's, London on 11 February 1994, for reduced-size version his 1873 work "The Shadow of Death".
His paintings were notable for their great attention to detail, vivid colour and elaborate symbolism. These features were influenced by the writings of John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle, according to whom the world itself should be read as a system of visual signs. For Hunt it was the duty of the artist to reveal the correspondence between sign and fact. Out of all the members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood Hunt remained most true to their ideals throughout his career. He was always keen to maximise the popular appeal and public visibility of his works.
He eventually had to give up painting because failing eyesight meant that he could not get the level of quality that he wanted. His last major works, "The Lady of Shalott" and a large version of "The Light of the World" were completed with the help of his assistant, Edward Robert Hughes.

Geoffroy's cat

Geoffroy's cat ("Leopardus geoffroyi") is a wild cat native to southern and central South America. It is about the size of a domestic cat. The species is relatively common in many areas, but is considered to be "near threatened" by IUCN.
The cat was examined and described by the early 19th century French anatomist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. He collected it on an expedition to South America.
Geoffroy's cats live in the Andes, Pampas (scrubby forest parts), and Gran Chaco landscape. They are found from southern Bolivia to the Straits of Magellan, at heights from sea level to . They prefer open woodland or scrubland habitats with plenty of cover, but are also found in grasslands and marshy areas. Although they are able to climb trees, they rarely do so, except to leave faeces to scent mark their territory.
Geoffroy's cat is nocturnal. It eats rodents, hares, small lizards, insects, and occasionally frogs and fish. Like other small cats, it is a solitary hunter, and only comes together during the mating season. Females have territories ranging from , while males have larger ranges, reaching up to .

African-American Civil Rights Movement

The African-American Civil Rights Movement was a group of social movements in the United States. Their goal was to gain equal rights for African-American people. The word "African-American" was not used at the time, so the movement was usually called The Civil Rights Movement. 
This article talks about the part of the movement that lasted from about 1954 to 1968.
The movement is famous for using non-violent protests and civil disobedience (peacefully refusing to follow unfair laws). Activists used strategies like boycotts, sit-ins, and protest marches. Sometimes police or racist white people would attack them, but the activists never fought back.
However, the Civil Rights Movement was made up of many different people and groups. Not everyone believed the same things. For example, the Black Power movement believed black people should demand their civil rights and force white leaders to give them those rights.
The Civil Rights Movement was also made of people of different races and religions. The Movement's leaders and most of its activists were African-American. However, the Movement got political and financial support from labor unions, religious groups, and some white politicians, like Lyndon B. Johnson. Activists of all races came to join African-Americans in marches, sit-ins, and protests.
The Civil Rights Movement was very successful. It helped get five federal laws and two amendments to the Constitution passed. These officially protected African Americans' rights. It also helped change many white people's attitudes about the way black people were treated and the rights they deserved.
Before the American Civil War, there were almost four million black slaves in the United States. Only white men with property could vote, and only white people could be United States citizens.
After the Civil War, the United States government passed three Constitutional amendments:
After the Civil War, the U.S. government tried to enforce the rights of ex-slaves in the South through a process called Reconstruction. However, in 1876, Reconstruction ended. By the 1890s, the Southern states' legislatures were all-white again. Southern Democrats, who did not support civil rights for blacks, completely ruled the South. This gave them a lot of power in the United States Congress. For example, Southern Democrats were able to make sure that laws against lynching did not pass.
Starting in 1890, Southern Democrats began to pass state laws that took away the rights African Americans had gained. These racist laws became known as Jim Crow laws. For example, they included:
In 1896, the United States Supreme Court ruled in a case called "Plessy v. Ferguson" that these laws were legal. They said that having things be "separate but equal" was fine. In the South, everything was separate. However, places like black schools and libraries got much less money and were not as good as places for whites. Things were separate, but not equal.
Violence against black people increased. Individuals, groups, police, and huge crowds of people could hurt or even kill African Americans, without the government trying to stop them or punishing them. Lynchings became more common.
Problems were worst in the South. However, social discrimination and tensions affected African Americans in other areas as well.
Segregation in housing was a problem across the United States. Many African Americans could not get mortgages to buy houses. Realtors would not sell black people houses in the suburbs, where white people lived. They also would not rent apartments in white areas. Until the 1950s, the federal government did nothing about this.
When he was elected in 1913, President Woodrow Wilson made government offices segregated. He believed that segregation was best for everyone.
Black people fought in both World War I and World War II. However, the military was segregated, and they were not given the same opportunities as white soldiers. After activism from black veterans, President Harry Truman de-segregated the military in 1948.
African Americans tried to fight back against discrimination in many ways. They formed new groups and tried to form labor unions. They tried to use the courts to get justice. For example, in 1909, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was created. It fought to end race discrimination through lawsuits, education, and lobbying.
However, eventually, many African Americans became frustrated and began to dislike the idea of using slow, legal strategies to achieve desegregation. Instead, African American activists decided to use a combination of protests, nonviolence, and civil disobedience. This is how the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1954-1968 began.
<br><br>
Schools in the South, and some other parts of the country, had been segregated since 1896. In that year, the Supreme Court had ruled in "Plessy v. Ferguson" that segregation was legal, as long as things were "separate but equal."
In 1951, thirteen black parents filed a class action lawsuit against the Board of Education in Topeka, Kansas. In the lawsuit, the parents argued that the black and white schools were not "separate but equal." They said the black school was much worse than the white one.
The lawsuit eventually went to the United States Supreme Court. After years of work, Thurgood Marshall and a team of other NAACP lawyers won the case. The Supreme Court ruled that segregated schools were illegal. All nine Supreme Court judges agreed. 
In their decision, the Court said:
"We conclude that, in ... public education, the doctrine of "separate but equal" has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal." 
This was the Civil Rights Movement's first major victory. However, "Brown" did not reverse "Plessy v. Ferguson." Brown made segregation in schools illegal. But segregation in all other places was still legal.
<br><br>
Civil rights leaders focused on Montgomery, Alabama, because the segregation there was so extreme. On December 1, 1955, local black leader Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. Parks was a civil rights activist and NAACP member; she had just returned from a training on nonviolent civil disobedience. She was arrested.
African-Americans gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott. They decided they would not ride on the buses again until they were treated the same as whites. Under segregation, blacks could not sit in front of whites - they had to sit in the back of the bus. Also, if a white person told a black person to move so they could sit down, the black person had to.
Most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans took part in the boycott. It lasted for 381 days and almost bankrupt the bus system. Meanwhile, the NAACP had been working on a lawsuit about segregation on buses. In 1956, they won the case, and the Supreme Court ordered Alabama to de-segregate its buses. The boycott ended with a victory.
<br><br>
In 1957, the NAACP had signed up nine African American students (called the "Little Rock Nine") to go to Little Rock Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. Before this, only whites were allowed at the school. However, the Little Rock School Board had agreed to follow the Supreme Court's decision in "Brown v. Board of Education" and de-segregate its schools.
Then came the black students' first day of school. The Governor of Arkansas called out soldiers from the Arkansas National Guard to prevent the black students from even entering the school. This was against a Supreme Court ruling, so President Dwight D. Eisenhower got involved. He took control of the Arkansas National Guard and ordered them to leave the school. Then he sent soldiers from the United States Army to protect the students. This was an important civil rights victory. It meant the federal government was willing to get involved and force states to end segregation in schools.
Unfortunately, the Little Rock Nine were treated very badly by many of the white students at the school. At the end of the school year, Little Rock Central High School closed so it would not have to allow black students the next year. Other schools across the South did the same thing.
<br><br>
Between 1958 and 1960, activists used sit-ins to protest segregation at lunch counters (small restaurants inside stores). They would sit at the lunch counter and politely ask to buy some food. When they were told to leave, they would continue to sit quietly at the counter. Often they would stay until the lunch counter closed. Groups of activists would keep coming back to sit in at the same places until those places agreed to serve African Americans at their lunch counters.
In 1958, the NAACP organized the first sit-in in Wichita, Kansas. They sat in at a lunch counter in in a store called Dockum's Drug Store. After three weeks, they got the store to de-segregate. Not long after, all of the Dockum Drug Stores in Kansas were de-segregated. Next, students in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma led a successful sit-in at another drug store.
In 1960, college students (including some white students) began to sit in at a Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina. After a while, they began to sit in at other lunch counters. In the stores that held these lunch counters, sales dropped by one-third. These stores de-segregated to avoid continuing to lose money. After five months of sit-ins, the Woolworth's in Greensboro also de-segregated its lunch counter. Newspapers all over the country wrote about the Greensboro sit-ins. Soon, people started sitting in across the South.
A few days after the Greensboro students started their sit-in, students in Nashville, Tennessee began their own sit-ins. They chose stores in the part of Nashville that had the most businesses. Before starting their sit-ins, they decided they would not be violent, no matter what. They wrote out rules, which activists in other cities began to use also. Their rules said:
"Do not [hit] back or curse if abused. ... Do not block entrances to stores outside [or] the aisles inside. [Be polite] and friendly at all times. Do sit straight; always face the counter. ... Do refer information seekers to your leader in a polite manner. Remember the teachings of Jesus, Gandhi, Martin Luther King. Love and nonviolence is the way."
Many of the Nashville students were attacked and abused by groups of white people; arrested; and even beaten by police. However, the students were always nonviolent. Their protests, and the attacks on them, brought more newspaper stories and attention. It also showed how the activists were truly nonviolent. After three months of sit-ins, all of the lunch counters in Nashville's downtown department stores were de-segregated.
Soon, there were sit-ins all over the country. Sit-ins even happened in Nevada, and in northern states like Ohio. Over 70,000 people, black and white, took part in sit-ins. They used sit-ins to protest all kinds of segregated places - not just lunch counters, but also beaches, parks, museums, libraries, swimming pools, and other public places.
The sit-ins even got the support of President Eisenhower. After the Greensboro sit-ins started, he said he was "deeply sympathetic with the efforts of any group to enjoy the rights of equality that they are guaranteed by the Constitution." 
In April 1960, students who had led sit-ins were invited to a conference. At the conference, they decided to form the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). SNCC would become an important group in the civil rights movement.
<br><br>
In 1960, the Supreme Court had ruled in "Boynton v. Virginia" that it was illegal to segregate people on public transportation that was going from one state to another. In 1961, student activists decided to test whether the Southern states would follow this ruling. Groups of black and white activists decided to ride buses through the South, sitting together instead of segregating themselves. They planned to ride buses from Washington, D.C., to New Orleans, Louisiana. They called these rides the "Freedom Rides."
The Freedom Riders were met with danger and violence. For example:
The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) brought in more Freedom Riders to keep the movement going. They were also met with violence:
However, people around the country began to support the Freedom Riders, who had never used violence, even when being attacked. Eventually, Robert Kennedy, the Attorney General in his brother John F. Kennedy's government, insisted on a new law about de-segregation. It said that:
<br><br>
Between 1961 and 1965, activist groups worked on trying to get black people registered (signed up) to vote. Since the end of Reconstruction, the Southern states had passed laws and used many strategies to keep black people from registering to vote. Often, these laws did not apply to white people.
Voter registration activists started out in Mississippi. All of Mississippi's civil rights organizations joined together to try to get people registered. Activist groups in Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina then started similar programs. However, when the activists tried to register black people to vote, police, white racists, and the Ku Klux Klan beat, arrested, shot, and even murdered them. 
Meanwhile, black people who tried to register to vote were fired from their jobs, thrown out of their homes, beaten, arrested, threatened, and sometimes murdered.
In 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed. It made discrimination illegal, and specifically said it was illegal to have different voter registration requirements for different races. However, even after this law was passed, the Southern states still made it very difficult for black people to vote. Finally, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed. This law included ways to make sure that all United States citizens were getting their right to vote.
Starting in 1956, a black man named Clyde Kennard wanted to go to Mississippi Southern College. Kennard had served in the Korean War, and he wanted to use the GI Bill to go to college. The college's president, William McCain, asked state politicians and a local racist group who supported segregation to make sure Kennard never got into the college.
Kenner was arrested twice for crimes he never committed. Eventually he was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison. After Kennard had spent three years in prison doing forced labor, Governor Ross Barnett pardoned him. Journalists had looked into Kennard's case, and wrote that the state did not give Kennard the treatment he needed for his colon cancer. Kennard died that same year. Later, in 2006, a court ruled that Kennard was innocent of the crimes he had been sent to jail for.
In September 1962, James Meredith won a lawsuit that gave him the right to go to the University of Mississippi. He tried three times to get into the university to sign up for classes. Governor Ross Barnett blocked Meredith each time. He told Meredith: "[N]o school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor." 
Attorney General Robert Kennedy sent United States Marshals to protect Meredith. On September 30, 1962, Meredith was able to enter the college with the Marshals protecting him. However, that evening, students and other racist whites started a riot. They threw rocks and fired guns at the Marshals. Two people were killed; 28 marshals were shot; and another 160 people were hurt. President John F. Kennedy sent the United States Army to the school to stop the riot. Meredith was able to begin classes at the college the day after the Army arrived. Meredith survived harassment and isolation at the college and graduated on August 18, 1963, with a a degree in political science.
Meredith and other activists kept working on de-segregating public universities. In 1965, the first two African American students were able to go to the University of Southern Mississippi.
<br><br>
In 1963, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) started a campaign in Birmingham, Alabama. Its goals were to de-segregate the stores in downtown Birmingham; make hiring fair; and create a committee, including blacks and whites, that would make a plan for de-segregating Birmingham's schools. Martin Luther King described Birmingham as "probably the most [completely] segregated city in the United States."
Birmingham's Commissioner of Public Safety was Eugene "Bull" Connor. (A Commissioner of Public Safety is in charge of the police and fire department, and deals with emergencies that could be dangerous to people in the city.) Connor was very much against integration. He often let the police, Ku Klux Klan, and racist white people attack civil rights activists. He promised that blacks and whites would never be integrated in Birmingham.
The activists used a few different non-violent ways of protesting, including sit-ins, "kneel-ins" at local churches, and marches. However, the city got a court order saying all protests like this were illegal. The activists knew this was illegal, and in an act of civil disobedience, they refused to follow the court order. The protesters, including Martin Luther King, were arrested.
While in jail, King was held in solitary confinement. While there, he wrote his famous "Letter from Birmingham Jail." He was let go after about a week.
However, very few activists could afford to risk being arrested. One of SCLC's leaders then came up with the idea of training high school, college, and elementary school students to take part in the protests. He reasoned that students did not have full-time jobs to go to, they did not have families to take care of, and they could "afford" to be in jail more than their parents.
"Newsweek" magazine later named this plan the "Children's Crusade." On May 2, more than 600 students, including some as young as 8 years old, tried to march from a local church to City Hall. They were all arrested.
The next day, another 1,000 students started to march. Bull Connor let police dogs loose to attack them and used fire hoses to knock down the students. Reporters were there, and videos and pictures showing the violence were shown on television and printed across the country.
People throughout the United States were so angry at seeing these videos that President Kennedy worked with the SCLC and the white businesses in Birmingham to work out an agreement. It said:
Some of Birmingham's whites were not happy with this agreement. They bombed the SCLC's headquarters; the home of King's brother; and a hotel where King had been staying. Thousands of blacks reacted by rioting; some burned buildings and one even stabbed and hurt a police officer.
On September 15, 1963, the Ku Klux Klan bombed a church in Birmingham, where civil rights activists often met before starting their marches. Since it was a Sunday, church services were going on. The bomb killed four young girls and hurt 22 other people.
<br><br>
During the spring and summer of 1963, there were protests in over a hundred United States cities, including Northern cities. There were riots in Chicago after a white police officer shot a 14-year-old black boy who was running away from the scene of a robbery. In Philadelphia and Harlem, black activists and white workers fought when the activists tried to integrate state-run construction projects.On June 6, over a thousand white people attacked a sit-in in North Carolina; black activists fought back, and a white man was killed.
In Cambridge, Maryland, white leaders declared martial law to stop fighting between blacks and whites. Attorney General Robert Kennedy had to get involved to create an agreement to de-segregate the city.
On June 11, 1963, Alabama Governor George Wallace actually stood in the doorway of the University of Alabama to stop its first two black students from getting inside. President Kennedy had to send United States soldiers to make him get out of the doorway, and make sure that the black students could get into the school.
Meanwhile, the Kennedy government had become very worried. Black leaders had told Robert Kennedy that it was getting harder and harder for African Americans to be nonviolent when they were getting attacked, and when it was taking so long for the United States government to help them get their civil rights. On the evening of June 11, President Kennedy gave a speech about civil rights. He talked about "a rising tide of discontent [unhappiness] that threatens the public safety." He asked Congress to pass new civil rights laws. He also asked Americans to support civil rights as "a moral issue ... in our daily lives."
In the early morning of June 12, Medgar Evers, a leader of the Mississippi NAACP, was murdered by a Ku Klux Klan member. The next week, President Kennedy gave Congress his Civil Rights bill, and asked them to make it into law.
<br><br>
In 1963, civil rights leaders planned a protest march in Washington, D.C. All of the major civil rights groups, some labor unions, and other liberal groups cooperated in planning the march. The march's full name was "The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom." The goals for the march were to get civil rights laws passed; to get the U.S. government to create more jobs; and to get equal, good housing, education, jobs, and voting rights for everyone. However, the most important goal was to get President Kennedy's civil rights law passed.
Many people thought it would be impossible for so many activists to come together without violence and rioting. The United States government got 19,000 soldiers ready nearby, in case of riots. Hospitals got ready to treat huge numbers of injured people. The government made selling alcohol in Washington, D.C., illegal for the day.
The March on Washington was one of the largest non-violent protests for human rights in United States history. Martin Luther King, Jr., thought that having 100,000 marchers would make the event successful. On August 28, 1963, about 250,000 activists from all over the country came together for the march. The marchers included about 60,000 white people (including church groups and labor union members), and between 75 and 100 members of Congress. Together, they marched from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial. There, they listened to civil rights leaders speak.
Martin Luther King, Jr., spoke last. His speech, called "I Have a Dream," became one of history's most famous civil rights speeches.
Historians have said that the March on Washington helped get President Kennedy's civil rights bill passed.

Malcolm X was an American minister who converted to Islam in prison, around 1948. He became a member of the Nation of Islam. This group believed in black supremacy - that the black race was the best of all. They believed that blacks should be completely independent from whites, and should eventually return to Africa. They also believed that black people had the right to fight back and use violence to get their rights. Because of this, Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam did not support the civil rights movement, because it was non-violent and supported integration.
However, in March 1964, Malcolm X was kicked out of the Nation of Islam, because he had disagreements with the group's leader, Elijah Muhammad. He offered to work with other civil rights groups, if they accepted that blacks had the right to defend themselves.
On March 26, 1964, Malcolm met with Martin Luther King, Jr. Malcolm had a plan to bring the United States before the United Nations on charges that the U.S. violated African Americans' human rights. Dr. King may have been planning to support this.
Between 1963 and 1964, civil rights activists got more angry and more likely to fight back against whites. In April 1964, Malcolm gave a famous speech called "The Ballot or the Bullet." ("The ballot" means "voting.") In the speech, he said that if the U.S. government is "unwilling or unable to defend the lives and the property of Negroes," then African Americans should defend themselves. He warned politicians that many African Americans were not willing "to turn the other cheek any longer." Then he warned white America about what would happen if blacks were not allowed to vote:
<br>
In the summer of 1964, civil rights groups brought almost 1,000 activists to Mississippi. Most of them were white college students. Their goals were to work together with black activists to register voters, and to teach summer school to black children in "Freedom Schools." They also wanted to help create the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP). At the time, only white people could take part in the Mississippi Democratic Party. The MFDP was planned as another political party that would allow black and white Democrats to take part in politics.
Many white Mississippians were angry that people from other states were coming in and trying to change their society. Government workers, police, the Ku Klux Klan, and other racist whites used many strategies to attack the activists and black people who were trying to register to vote. The Freedom Summer project lasted for ten weeks. During that time, 1,062 activists were arrested; 80 were beaten; and 4 were killed. Three black Mississippians were murdered because they supported civil rights. Thirty-seven churches, and thirty black homes or businesses, were bombed or burned.
On June 21, 1964, three Freedom Summer activists disappeared. Weeks later, their bodies were found. They had been murdered by members of the local Ku Klux Klan - including some who were also police in the Neshoba County sheriff's department. When people were searching for their bodies in local swamps and rivers, they found the bodies of a 14-year-old boy and seven other men who also seemed to have been murdered at some time.
During Freedom Summer, activists set up at least 30 Freedom Schools, and taught about 3,500 students. The students included children, adults, and the elderly. The schools taught about many things, like black history; civil rights; politics; the freedom movement; and the basic reading and writing skills needed to vote.
Also during the summer, about 17,000 black Mississippians tried to register to vote. Only 1,600 were able to. However, more than 80,000 joined the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP). This showed that they wanted to vote and take part in politics, not just let white people do it for them.

John F. Kennedy's suggested civil rights bill had support from Northern members of Congress - both Democrats and Republicans. However, Southern Senators blocked the suggested law from passing. They filibustered for 54 days to block the bill from becoming a law. Finally, President Lyndon B. Johnson got a bill to pass.
On July 2, 1964, Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The law said:
<br><br>
In December 1964, Martin Luther King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. When giving him the award, the Chairman of the Nobel Committee said:
In January 1965, Martin Luther King and the SCLC went to Selma, Alabama. Civil rights groups there had asked them to come help get black people registered to vote. At the time, 99% of the people registered to vote in Selma were white. Together, they started working on voting rights.
However, the next month, an African-American man named Jimmie Lee Jackson was shot by a police officer during a peaceful march. Jackson died. Many African-American people were very angry. The SCLC was worried that people were so angry that they would get violent.
The SCLC decided to organize a march from Selma to Montgomery. This would be a 54-mile (87-kilometer) march. Activists hoped the march would show how badly African-Americans wanted to vote. They also wanted to show that they would not let racism or violence stop them from getting equal rights.
The first march was on March 7, 1965. Police officers and racist whites attacked the marchers with clubs and tear gas. They threatened to throw the marchers off the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Seventeen marchers had to go to the hospital, and 50 others were also injured. This day came to be called Bloody Sunday. Pictures and film of the marchers being beaten were shown in newspapers and on television around the world. 
Seeing these things made more people support the civil rights activists. People came from all over the United States to march with the activists. One of them, James Reeb, was attacked by white people for supporting civil rights. He died on March 11, 1965.
Finally, President Johnson decided to send soldiers from the United States Army and the Alabama National Guard to protect the marchers. From March 21 to March 25, the marchers walked along the "Jefferson Davis Highway" from Selma to Montgomery. On March 25, 25,000 people entered Montgomery. Martin Luther King gave a speech called "How Long? Not Long" at the Alabama State Capitol. He told the marchers that it would not be long before they had equal rights, "because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."
After the march, Viola Liuzzo, a white woman from Detroit, drove some other marchers to the airport. While she was driving back, she was murdered by three members of the Ku Klux Klan.
<br><br>
On August 6, 1965, the United States passed the Voting Rights Act. This law made it illegal to stop somebody from voting because of their race. This meant that all the state laws that kept black people from voting were now illegal.
For almost 100 years, registrars (the government workers who had registered people to vote) were all white. They had total power over who they could register and who they would not register. If a registrar refused to let a black person register, that person could only file a lawsuit, which they were not likely to win. However, the Voting Rights Act finally made a change to this system. If a registrar discriminated against black people, the Attorney General could send federal workers to replace local registrars.
The law worked right away. Within a few months, 250,000 new black voters had signed up to vote. One out of every three of them was registered by a federal worker who replaced a racist registrar. In 1965, 74% of Mississippi's black voters actually voted, and more black politicians were elected in Mississippi than in any other state. By 1967, most African Americans were registered to vote in 9 of the 13 states in the South.
Politics in the South were completely changed by African Americans having the power to vote. White politicians could no longer make laws about African Americans without blacks having a say. In many parts of the South, black people outnumbered whites. This meant that they could vote in black politicians, and vote out racist whites. Also, black people who were registered to vote could be on juries. Before this, any time an African American was charged with a crime, the jury that decided whether they were guilty would be all-white.
<br><br>
From 1966 to 1968, the civil rights movement focused a lot on fair housing. Even outside the South, fair housing was a problem. For example, in 1963, California passed a Fair Housing Act which made segregation in housing illegal. White voters and real estate lobbyists got the law reversed the next year. This helped cause the Watts Riots. (Later, in 1966, California made the Fair Housing Act the law again.)
Activists, including Martin Luther King, led a movement for fair housing in Chicago in 1966. The next year, young NAACP members did the same in Milwaukee. Activists in both cities got attacked physically by white homeowners, and legally by politicians who supported segregation.
Of all the civil rights laws passed during the Civil Rights Movement, the Fair Housing Act was the hardest to pass. The law would make discrimination in housing illegal. This meant black people would be allowed to move into white neighborhoods. As Senator Walter Mondale said: "This was civil rights getting personal."
The suggested Fair Housing Bill was sent to the United States Senate first. There, most Senators - Northern and Southern - were against the bill. In March of 1968, the Senate sent a weaker version to the House of Representatives. The House was expected to make changes that would make the bill even weaker.
That did not happen. On April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King was murdered. This made many members of Congress feel like they needed to do something about civil rights quickly. The day after Dr. King's murder, Senator Mondale stood in front of the Senate and said:
On April 10, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1968. President Johnson signed the law the next day. Part of the law is called the "Fair Housing Act." It makes it illegal to discriminate in selling, renting, or lending money for housing, based on a person's race, skin color, religion, or home country.
<br><br>
In 1968, Martin Luther King and the SCLC were planning the Poor People's Campaign. People of all races took part in the movement. The movement's goal was to decrease poverty for people of all races.
As part of his work against poverty, Dr. King and the SCLC started to speak out against the Vietnam War. King argued that poor people in Vietnam were being killed, and that the War would only make them poorer. He also argued that the United States was spending more and more money and time on the War, and less on programs to help poor Americans.
In March 1968, Dr. King was invited to Memphis, Tennessee to support garbage workers that were on strike. These workers were paid very little, and two workers had been killed doing their jobs. They wanted to be members of a labor union. Dr. King thought this strike was a perfect fit for his Poor People's Campaign. As soon as he got to Memphis, King started getting threats.
The day before he was murdered, King gave a sermon called "I've Been to the Mountaintop." The next day he was murdered. After King was killed, people rioted in more than 100 cities across the United States.
Civil rights leader Ralph Abernathy continued the Poor People's Campaign after King's death. About 3,000 activists camped out on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., for about six weeks.
The day before Dr. King's funeral, his wife, Coretta Scott King, and three of their children led 20,000 marchers through Memphis. Soldiers protected the marchers. On April 9, Mrs. King led another 150,000 people through Atlanta during Dr. King's funeral. An old, wooden wagon, pulled by mules, pulled Dr. King's casket. The wagon was a symbol of Dr. King's Poor People's Campaign.
Mrs. King once said:
<br><br>
Many people were killed during the Civil Rights Movement. Some were killed because they supported civil rights. Others were killed by the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) or other racist whites who wanted to terrorize black people. No one knows just how many people were killed during the Civil Rights Movement. However, here are some examples. People whose names are highlighted in blue were children or teenagers when they were killed.
An unknown number of other people died or were killed during the Civil Rights Movement.

Parakeet is a name for any small to medium sized species of parrot, often with long tail feathers. Basically, it is a common term for a small parrot. Another term used in America for parakeets is conure.
Parakeets breed better in groups, but are usually fine breeding in pairs. Having other parakeets encourages a pair to breed, which is why breeding in groups is more successful. However, many breeders choose to breed in pairs because that way they know which parents produced any given birds. If the parakeet does lay eggs, it produces about six to eight.

Helix (genus)

Helix is a genus of large air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs. 
The genus "Helix" is known from the Oligocene onwards.
This genus is native to Europe and the regions around the Mediterranean Sea. 
The best-known species include "Helix aspersa", the common, or brown garden snail, and "Helix pomatia", the Roman snail, Burgundy snail, or edible snail. "H. pomatia" and some other species are eaten as escargots.
"Helix" snails have been introduced throughout the world, where some, especially "H. aspersa", have become garden pests.
Snails in this genus create and use love darts during mating.
"Helix" snails prefer cool, damp environments, as they easily get dry. Snails are most active at night and after rainfall. During unfavourable conditions, a snail will remain inside its shell, usually under rocks or other hiding places, to avoid being discovered by predators. In dry climates snails will naturally congregate near water sources, including artificial sources such as waste-water outlets of air conditioners.
The common garden snail ("Helix aspersa") is herbivorous. These snails are able to digest most vegetation including carrots and lettuce. They also have a specialized crop of symbiotic bacteria that help their digestion, especially by breaking down the polysaccharide cellulose into simple sugars.

Rice Park, Saint Paul, Minnesota

Rice Park is a public park located in Saint Paul, Minnesota.
Before it became a park, Rice Park was used as an open space to dry laundry and graze animals. The land was eventually made into a "public square" in 1849 by John R. Irvine, a territorial pioneer and Henry M. Rice, territorial delegate and United States Senator. The park was named after early Minnesota Senator Henry M. Rice. Rice park sits atop a small hill where glacial melt failed to erode completely. The park was mostly ignored until 1860 when Mayor John S. Prince had shade trees planted. In the 1870s the park got a fountain and a bandstand. A pair of squirrels were given to the park by the chief of police in Memphis, Tennessee as an act of goodwill. Eventually, electric lights were installed in 1883. This was on the occasion of the visit by President Chester A. Arthur, former president Ulysses S. Grant, and General William Tecumseh Sherman, at the opening of Northern Pacific's West Coast rail line. The historic buildings, museums, and music halls that border the park were constructed over a period of nearly 100 years. On May 10, 1903 Saint Paul Globe reported that Rice Park was the traditional place in St. Paul for newly engaged couples to go and sit. The Women’s Institute of Saint Paul donated a new fountain to the park on June 14, 1965. Minnesota sculptor Alonzo Hauser designed the fountain, titled 'the Source', with a statue of a woman in the water. Rice Park has been honored as a Great Place in America by the American Planning Association in 2011.
Rice Park is about 2 acres in size. It is located at 4th Street and Washington Street in downtown Saint Paul, Minnesota.
Rice Park sits above the Mississippi River’s highest flood level, so its surroundings are important buildings like the Federal Customs House (now Landmark Center), Central Public Library, and the grand St. Paul Hotel. More recently the park was given character sculptures from the Peanuts cartoons to honor the birthplace of Peanuts cartoonist Charles Schulz. It also has an ice rink during the winter months. Rice Park forms a pathway between eight different significant buildings, adding to its popularity.
Rice Park was placed right in the heart of the busy city of Saint Paul. The park is used year-round. During the summer, music, specifically blues, jazz, and original composition, can be heard at noon on various Mondays starting in June. The park has an annual Winter Carnival, one of the oldest and largest winter festivals in the country. These activities include a tree lighting ceremony, ice skating, watching fireworks, listening to holiday music and family-friendly activities. Rice Park is also available for private parties and gatherings. It can accommodate a wedding party of up to 200 people. 
In addition, several events have been located at Rice Park. For instance, the funeral of Charles Luth, a switchman who was murdered during the Pullman strike, was held at the park in 1894.

Chief of police

A chief of police (also known as police chief or chief) is the title typically given to the top official in a police department, particularly in North America. Other titles for this position include Commissioner, Superintendent, and Chief Constable. A Chief of Police is usually a municipal employee of a city or town. In contrast, a U.S. Sheriff is generally elected by the voters of a county. Some states have both an appointed and an elected Chief of Police (Louisiana). The fraternal organization International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) is an organization often associated with many Chiefs of Police.
A police chief is the top executive officer in a police department. The job of a chief, no matter what the size of the police department, is to protect their community. A chief is responsible for the budget of a police department. He or she is also responsible for the conduct of all police officers in the department. In larger police departments, a chief can delegate some of his responsibilities to an assistant Chief (Deputy Chief, etc.). 
Chief police officer is a phrase used in the United Kingdom to describe the position of the most senior police officer in a police force. It refers to the 53 Chief Constables, the Commissioner of the City of London Police or the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. They are members of the Association of Chief Police Officers. The phrase is used in legislation on the power to permit public processions, or grant firearms licenses. Many routine activities are delegated to constables.
No police officers in the UK are elected. There is a mixed system of control by local and central government, and local committees act in advice and supervision. Various organisations are permitted to hire and control their own security forces: the armed forces, the railways, certain branches of the security services, and a number of private organisations. 
Policing in Canada is usually the responsibility of the province. Usually police chiefs run the police departments. In eight of Canada's ten provinces the Royal Canadian Mounted Police act as regional police. They also act as the municipal police in the three territories and in many towns in British Columbia. In the province of Ontario, a Chief of Police must be a sworn police officer.
Chiefs of police in the United States have two unique opportunities for training for the position. The FBI offers executive police training at their academy. The University of Louisville has the Southern Police Institute. Police chiefs of larger cities often work for a police commissioner. In those cases the chief of police manages the day-to-day business of the police department. The chief may also work for a board of commissioners.
In Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria, the chief of police is a Cabinet minister position. In many parts of the world Interpol has taken a role in organizing regional councils of police chiefs. They work in close cooperation with police chiefs to exchange methods and ideas. Many councils take these ideas directly to their governments which often put them into effect. Regional and sub-regional chiefs of police councils are set up in most parts of Asia, Africa and Europe. North and South American have functioning councils that work with Interpol. Central American councils are a work in progress.

Special Branch

Special Branch is the British police force which works mostly for the security services, especially MI5. It has had various changes of name, while its function has stayed much the same.
It was formed in London in 1883. Branches were formed in Ireland (before the Republic of Ireland was founded) and later Northern Ireland. The Metropolitan Police had their own Special Branch, until it was merged with the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch (SO13) to form Counter Terrorism Command or SO15 in 2006.
The main function for all these branches was to collect evidence and arrest the enemies of the United Kingdom who lived on home territory. Historically, these have been the IRA (and its splinter braches), Soviet and Russian intelligence agents, and Islamic extremists and terrorists.
Special Branch has contact with the Security Service and the Home Office. They use the prefix "Detective" in front of their ranks, and are governed by the same laws as the general police. Under British law, MI5 officers are not permitted actually to lay hands on members of the public. Observations, wire taps ("lawful interception"), arrests, interrogations and preparing cases for prosecution are usually done by the Special Branch.
Special Branch have responsibility for the personal protection of (non-royal) VIPs, and are examining officers at designated ports and airports, as prescribed by the Terrorism Act 2000.
The intelligence work of Special Branch sits somewhere between that of the Security Service and that of the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch (SO13). It was announced, in September 2005, that the Metropolitan Police Special Branch would be merging with the Anti-Terrorism Branch of the Metropolitan Police to form a new department called Counter Terrorism Command. The new department came into being on 2 October 2006.
Most, if not all UK police services still maintain a Special Branch. Strathclyde Police had a Special Branch until it was renamed the Counter Terrorist Intelligence Section.

Pack (canine)

Pack is the name given to canines, which live and hunt together. That means the dog tribe, known as the Canini. It does not apply to foxes (the tribe Vulpini). Other caniforms (Caniformia) live singly or come together at mating times, with some exceptions (like the badger).
So, not all canids form packs. If they do, the size of the pack, and the social behaviour in the pack varies by species. The animals in the pack know each other. Always there is a hierarchy of dominance inside the pack. The classic case is the grey wolf. All packs are united by genetic relationship: they are family members.
One reason why some mammalian predators evolved group behaviour is that their prey lives in massive herds on grassland. The most notable predators on grassland are the wolves and jackals (caniforms) and the lions and hyaenas (feliforms). The same principle works with aquatic predators: if their prey goes in shoals or family groups, then the predators go in groups.

A Prairie Home Companion (movie)

A Prairie Home Companion is a 2006 American ensemble comedy movie. It was directed by Robert Altman. It was Altman's last movie before he died in November 2006. The movie is a fictional story of behind-the-scenes activities at the long-running public radio show "A Prairie Home Companion".
A long-running live radio show is in danger of being canceled by the new owners. The company owns both the radio station "WLT" and the theater where the show is broadcast. The movie takes place on the night of the show's last performance. The show has two visitors. The first is an angel calling herself Asphodel (Virginia Madsen). She comes to comfort the people who work on the show and to escort one of them to the afterlife. The other visitor is "the Axeman" (Tommy Lee Jones). He is the representative of the new owners who arrives to decide whether the show should be canceled. He makes it clear that the show is not what he considers modern popular programming. Although he too is escorted by the angel, the show is shut down anyway. In an at the end of the movie, the former cast members are reunited at Mickey's Diner. Their conversation pauses as they are joined by Asphodel.
To receive insurance for the shoot, Robert Altman had to hire Paul Thomas Anderson. He was a "backup" director who could take over if Altman could not work, The movie had the working title "The Last Show". Principal photography started on June 29, 2005, at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota. That is where the radio show is broadcast from. Filming ended on July 28, 2005. The movie was the second major picture to be filmed in Minnesota in 2005. (The first was "North Country", starring Charlize Theron and Harrelson,)
The Fitzgerald is a rather small building. Because of that, the movie makers thought about using other stage theaters in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region. With some effort, the necessary movie equipment was crammed into the structure. The basement was also used for sets due to lack of space. Set design had to make the show more visually interesting. Fake dressing rooms were used in the movie. The movie's production designer noted that Keillor's actual dressing room is "about the size of a very, very small bathroom". Mickey's Diner, a downtown St. Paul landmark, is also in the movie.
On November 1, 2005, the "Star Tribune" reported that an early screening in New York City for movie distributors resulted in a heavy bidding war. Picturehouse bought the rights. Company president Bob Berney, "aiming to capitalize on the name recognition of the 31-year-old radio program, recommended that the title revert to "A Prairie Home Companion". 'At the screening, Garrison said that to broaden the movie's appeal, they were thinking about changing the name to "Savage Love", so we may have an argument there,' Berney said."
"A Prairie Home Companion" opened the 2006 South by Southwest movie festival on March 10. It then premiered in St. Paul, on May 3, 2006, at the Fitzgerald Theater. The movie's stars arrived in ten horse-drawn carriages. Brian Williams of "NBC Nightly News" did his newscast from neighboring Minneapolis, Minnesota, that night so that he could attend.
Critics' general reaction to the movie was favorable. It got an 81% fresh rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert gave the movie four out of four stars. He wrote, "What a lovely film this is, so gentle and whimsical, so simple and profound". Ebert later added the movie to his "Great Movies" list.
Michael Medved gave the movie one and a half stars out of four. He wrote, "The entertainment value stands somewhere between thin and nonexistent" and "[it may be] the worst movie ever made that pooled the talents of four (count ‘em – four!) Oscar winners".
Desson Thomson from "The Washington Post" said that while the movie had its strengths, it was weaker than it should have been.
Meryl Streep won the Best Supporting Actress Award from the National Society of Film Critics for her role. Altman was also posthumously nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Director.
The movie had a successful limited release in the United States. It grossed $20,338,609 in the United States. It grossed $25,978,442 worldwide.
The movie's DVD was released on October 10, 2006. Special features included deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes documentary, and commentary by Altman and Kline. "A Prairie Home Companion Original Motion Picture Soundtrack" was released on May 23, 2006, by New Line.

Sequoyah was a Cherokee man. He invented a syllabary (alphabet based on syllables) for his people. Before that, they did not have an alphabet for their language.
Sequoyah was born into the Cherokee Nation. His mother was "Wut-teh". Not many people know about his early childhood. There are different stories on what happened. 
Sequoyah met many white people. He was fascinated by their "talking leaves," which was their writing system on paper. He wanted to make an alphabet for Cherokees to communicate too. He began making it around 1809. First he tried to make a symbol for every word, like in Chinese. That required too much remembering. Then he tried to make one for every idea, but gave up. Finally he made one symbol for every syllable in the Cherokee language. He made a syllabary with 86 letters. Many of the letters look like English because he had an English book that he could not read.
He taught the syllabary to his daughter, Ayokeh (Ayoka). Then he tested it in front of a group of leaders. They said a word, he wrote it down, and then Ayokeh repeated them. Originally people thought it was witchcraft, but then they started liking his syllabary. Many Cherokee learned it and eventually became literate, which means they could read and write. In fact, more Cherokees could read and write than nearby white people.
Sequoyah became a hero for giving Cherokee people a written language. Cherokee is still taught and used. There are now 85 symbols, instead of the original 86.

Elinor Wylie

Elinor Morton Wylie (7 September 1885 – 16 December 1928) was an American poet and novelist. She was popular in the 1920s and 1930s. She was also famous for her beauty and personality. She "was called the reigning queen of American poetry" in the 1920s.
Elinor Wylie was born Elinor Morton Hoyt on 7 September, 1885 in Somerville, New Jersey. She came from a prominent New Jersey family. Her parents were Henry Martyn Hoyt, Jr. and Anne Morton McMichael. Elinor was the oldest of five children.
When Elinor was twelve, the family moved to Washington, D.C.. This was when her father was appointed Assistant Attorney General. Elinor went to Miss Baldwin's School near Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. She next went to Mrs. Flint's School, and Holton-Arms School, both in Washington. She graduated in 1904. At the Corcoran gallery she studied drawing. As a girl, she liked reading books. 
Little more than a year after she finished school, she married Philip Hichborn, Jr. Together they had a son, Philip Hichborn, III. But she left her husband and son in 1910. She went to England with Horace Wylie. He was a Washington lawyer, was married and was 17 years older than Elinor. The scandal was widely publicized. 
Horace's wife finally agreed to a divorce, and Hichborn committed suicide. in 1916, Elinor and Wylie returned to America and got married. In 1919, the couple moved to Washington. There she met with famous writers. They said she should publish her poetry. 
First she sent poems to "Poetry", the leading American poetry magazine. The magazine accepted her poems. In 1921, she produced a book of poems called "Nets to Catch the Wind." It was popular with both critics and the public. Now Wylie became a celebrity. People liked her poetry, her charming personality, and her beauty.
Elinor Wylie left her second husband and moved to live in New York. In 1923, she divorced Wylie and married the critic, novelist and poet William Rose Benét. Although they stayed married, she separated from him, too. But she would visit him after the separation. 
In 1928, Elinor had a heart attack which left her in poor health. On December 16, 1928, she suddenly died of Bright's disease in New York.
According to Evelyn Hively, Elinor Wylie "subscribed fully to the theory that a poet's work, as Wallace Stevens says, lies in trying to wrestle experience into meaning." 
She admired poetry from the past. These included the Metaphysical poets and the Romantic poets. Her favorite poet was Percy Bysshe Shelley. He had a strong influence on Elinor's style. Her poetry often followed strict rules and traditions. For example, many of her poems were sonnets. She also used a lot of imagery. 
All of Elinor's long works of fiction were allegories. They dealt with the supernatural or the strange and unusual. She called these fantasies "fairytales".
Elinor Wylie was primarily a poet, but she also wrote four successful novels, or fantasies, as well as short stories and essays.

Op art

Op art is a style of painting which makes use of optical illusions and other kinds of unusual optical effects. Victor Vasarely a Hungarian artist, was perhaps the first to use this theme regularly, in the 1930s. In the 1960s, Bridget Riley became one of the world's best-known op artists. She specialised in the effects produced by closely fitted lines. Jesús Rafael Soto used mobile elements, so connecting op art with kinetic (moving) structures. 
The idea of visual illusions and effects fascinated other artists and intellectuals. The famous Dutch artist M.C. Escher drew impossible structures which worked by using visual illusions. The art historian Ernst Gombrich wrote a detailed study on visual effects in art. The psychologist Richard Gregory spent much of his career studying why the mind saw illusions.

Dog attack

When a dog attacks and bites a human this is generally known as dog attack. Dogs have been among the first animals to be domesticated and have lived with humans for a long time. Dog attacks are common in daily life. The biting dog causes an injury, which may be serious, and may lead to death. In addition to the bite wound, the dog may transmit diseases through the bite; one example for a disease transmitted through biting is rabies. 
There is a discussion whether certain breeds of dogs are more prone to producing an attack than others. 
Very often, the attack is triggered by human behavior.

Maria Cristina National High School

An institution of learning committed to provide quality education to all students and enable them to be responsible and productive members of the community imbued with the values of patriotism and nationalism, develop moral character and personal discipline and promote technological advancement and vocational efficiency.
Maria Cristina National High School was formerly known as Maria Cristina Barangay High School. The opening of said Barangay High School was based on the provision of RA 6050, otherwise known as the Barrio High School. In this event, request to open a barangay high school in Barangay Maria Cristina was initiated by the Barangay Captain with a joint petition of the residents of said barangay.
With its approval, the Maria Cristina Barangay High School was established during the year 1972 of June with 183 students man with 5 teachers. There were 2 sections in first year and one section in second year as a start. There were classes held at the barangay hall and 2 classes at the elementary school. The school grows in population causing the PTA to construct a temporary classroom made of nipa to accommodate enrollees on the following school year.
Due to the growing population, additional teachers were hired. What started with 3 sections man with 5 teachers become 17 sections man with 26 teachers funded under local school board and majority were funded by the national government.
At present, the school has already 11 sets of computers and other facilities needed by the growing population. There is already a 3 hectare lot owned by the National Power Corporation as the new school site of Maria Cristina National High School. A Memorandum of Agreement was signed between the National Transmission Corporation (TRANSCO) and the Local School Board of Iligan City Division to allow the usage of the unutilized portion of the lot of cadastral lot number 292, a land reserved for the project of National Power Corporation (NPC) by virtue of Proclamation Number 335 as the site of Maria Cristina National High School.
It is the school’s desire to develop the new site in order for the school to transfer and grow in terms of population, buildings, facilities and school equipment. Last June, 2004, the new site was being occupied by the fourth year students first due to the existence of two buildings with 6 classrooms only. However, at present, all the year levels already utilized the said site.
With the joint effort of the school and its stakeholders the dream to be all together at the designated new site of Maria Cristina National High School is now realized.

Wavefunction collapse

When a scientific experiment is done properly, it will give a measurable result. At each moment, the system (experiment) will be in one of several possible states. At the end, the experiment will be in a final state. At each point in time, the state of the system can be measured. 
Experiments done in quantum mechanics work the same way. The difference to classical mechanics is that at each point in time, several states are superposed (overlapping) to describe the state the experiment is in. These states are called eigenstates. In the same way as with classical mechanics, if a measurement is done, there is a single result. This result is the eigenvalue of one of the eigenstates. This means that measurement will reduce the several possible states to a single state by adding them together. After the measurement, the system will be in the state that was measured. In the Copenhagen interpretation, this reduction is known as wavefunction collapse. Collapse is one of two processes by which quantum systems evolve in time. The other is continuous evolution via the Schrödinger equation.
Werner Heisenberg was among the first to explain this situation, in a paper published in 1927. This result is controversial. Erwin Schrödinger used the thought experiment Schrödinger's cat to show this controversy.

So far four supernovae have been observed in NGC 2207. 
NGC 2207 is in the process of stripping IC 2163 of stars and material.
NGC 2207 is in the process of colliding and merging with IC 2163. But unlike the Antennae or the Mice galaxies, they are still two separate spiral galaxies. They are only in the first step of colliding and merging. Soon they will collide, probably looking a bit more like the Mice Galaxies. In about a billion years time they are expected to merge and become an elliptical galaxy.

Photorefractive keratectomy

Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is a type of laser eye surgery. PRK uses an ultraviolet laser to reshape the cornea (outer surface of the eye). PRK can correct astigmatism, nearsightedness, and farsightedness. Unlike LASIK, PRK does not create a flap in the eye. Although no surgery is completely safe, PRK has less complications or side effects than LASIK. Some patients who can not have LASIK may be able to get PRK. PRK is especially preferred over LASIK for people with high prescriptions, thin corneas, and people who are more likely to get eye injuries, such as athletes or police officers. Potential side effects or complications include seeing haloes, starbursts, or glare, corneal haze, dry eye, infection, blurry vision, double vision, and the continued need for glasses or contact lenses. Side effects are more likely if an old or obsolete laser is used, which many clinics still use. Side effects are usually temporary but may become permanent. Some temporary side effects may be caused by the eye drops used, and not the surgery itself.
The surgeon gives anesthetic drops in each eye, to prevent the patient from feeling pain. The epithelium (outer layer of the cornea) is brushed off, and the surgeon uses a laser to remove small amounts of the cornea, changing its shape. Mitomycin C is then applied to the eye, which helps prevent corneal haze. A bandage contact lens is then placed over the eye, and the epithelium grows back behind the contact lens. Vision will be blurry for a few days, and there will be some pain and discomfort. The recovery period is longer and more painful than LASIK. Several sets of eye drops, applied several times each day, are necessary for at least a week or longer. After about a week, the epithelium has grown back, and the surgeon removes the contact lens.

<doc id="457683" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=457683" title="Breast augmentation">
Breast augmentation

Breast augmentation is a surgical procedure used to increase the size of the breasts. 
Usually, implants are used, but another technique called fat grafting is sometimes used. The size increase can be as small as one cup size, or as large as 10 cup sizes or more. 
The larger the increase, the greater the risk of complications. Complications may include leaking of the implants, which may require the implants to be replaced. With larger breasts the whole weight balance of the body is changed, which may cause stress to the muscular and skeletal systems. 
A surgical implant is either an implant filled with saline-solution, or an implant filled with silicone-gel. The fat-graft transfer uses grafts of adipose fat tissue from the woman’s own body. A full assessment of this method is not yet available. The method does not allow for the huge size increase possible with implants, and slim women may not have enough fat tissue to allow the method to be used. 
Implants are inserted into the breast and filled with silicone or a saline solution. This is the most common method of augmentation.
Yarn-like polypropylene string is inserted into the breast, where it irritates the breast, causing it to fill with fluid. Polypropylene string produces very large size increases, often well over 20 cup sizes. It has a very high complication rate and is now banned in the United States and many other countries.
Fat is removed with liposuction from an area of the body where it is not desirable. The fat is then cleaned and injected into the breast.

Monk (TV series)

Monk is an American comedy-drama detective mystery television series. It was written for TV by Andy Breckman. It stars Tony Shalhoub. The show was on the air from July 2002 to December 2009. The last show before the series was cancelled was one of the most-watched in cable television history. Other actors in the show were Bitty Schram, Jason Gray-Stanford, Ted Levine and Traylor Howard.
Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) had been a good detective for the San Francisco police department. After his wife Trudy was killed by a car bomb, Monk had a nervous breakdown. He was too upset and afraid to work. He was then let go by the police department. 
After that he stayed inside his house for many years. He finally began to go outside his house; but only with the help of his nurse, Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram). He could only go places when she went with him to protect him from his fears. This let him do some work as a private detective. He still has a severe case of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Sometimes, the obsessive-compulsive disorder helps him figure out the answers to clues in cases. He has a great memory for details. Since he was a child, Monk has been able to notice small things that others miss.
Monk has to have everything clean and spends a lot of his day cleaning over and over. He also has a fear of germs. He cleans his toothbrush with boiling water. He vacuums his walls and ceilings in his home. 
Captain Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Randall "Randy" Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford) ask Monk for detective help when they can't figure out a crime scene. Stottlemeyer is usually frustrated by Monk's idiosyncrasies. But he respects Monk's amazing crime solving abilities.
When Monk is not working, he tries to solve his wife's murder. He often works on cases that involve women or bombs, because it reminds him of his wife.
In the middle of Season 3, Monk's nurse, Sharona Fleming, decides to move back to New Jersey. Monk then hires another assistant. Her name is Natalie Teeger (played by Traylor Howard). Natalie has a daughter named Julie Teeger. Her husband was in the United States Navy and was killed in combat years earlier.
