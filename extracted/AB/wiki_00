In 2010, Deen launched the Unpious website along with "Shtreimel," another ex-Hasidic blogger, and has served as its editor throughout. He has also written several pieces for other publications on the intersection of Hasidic and secular lives, including articles in the "Jewish Daily Forward", "Tablet Magazine", "Salon", and "Zeek".
He currently serves as a Board member at Footsteps, a New York City organization that assists formerly ultra-Orthodox Jews with transitioning to life outside the Orthodox world. 
Deen spent his early life among Satmar Hasidim in Borough Park, Brooklyn, and joined the Skverer sect when he was a teenager, moving to the town of New Square, to settle after marriage. He was married in 1993, and has five children.
In 2005, Deen was expelled from New Square by its leaders for holding heretical views, and several years later divorced his wife and left the Hasidic lifestyle entirely. He currently lives in Brooklyn New York He is mostly estranged from his children, who have remained among the Skverer Hasidim in New Square, N.Y.

Calculus of variations

The calculus of variations is a field of mathematical analysis. It usually deals with functions defined on the real numbers, and with finding minima and maxima of such functions. When finding a minimum or maximum, there are often additional conditions that need to be satisfied. In the 18th century, mathematicians such as Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange made this kind of calculus popular. 
Other people who influenced it include Adrien-Marie Legendre, Alfred Clebsch, Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi and Karl Weierstraß. Today, calculus of variations is used in different fields of science, such as geodesy, theoretical physics, classical mechanics and quantum mechanics.

Law of sines

The sine rule or law of sines, is a theorem in mathematics. It says that, if you have a triangle like the one in the picture, the equation below is true.
This is another version, which is also true.
D is equal to the diameter of the triangle's circumcircle. 
The law of sines is used to find the remaining sides of a triangle when two angles and a side are known. This is known as triangulation. However, this calculation can have a numerical error if an angle is close to 90 degrees. The law of sines can also be used when two sides and one of the angles not enclosed by the two sides are known. In some such cases, the formula gives two possible values for the enclosed angle. This is called an "ambiguous case".
The law of sines is one of two trigonometric equations which is used to find lengths and angles in scalene triangles. The other is the law of cosines.
The area formula_3 of any triangle can be written as one half of its base times its height (drawn from the vertex not on the base). Depending on which side one chooses to be the base, the area can be given by
Multiplying these by formula_5 gives

Welfare economics

Welfare economics is a field of economics that looks at the problem of allocating resources. It uses techniques from microeconomics to assess general well-being. From this assessment, it tries to find an allocation of productive factors as to desirability and economic efficiency within an economy, often relative to competitive general equilibrium. It analyzes "social welfare" in terms of economic activities of the individuals that compose the theoretical society considered. Individuals and their economic activities are the basic units for aggregating to social welfare. The aggregation may focus on a group of people, a community, or a society. There is no "social welfare" apart from the "welfare" associated with its individual units.
Welfare economics typically takes individual preferences as given and tries to improve welfare in terms of Pareto efficiency. As an example, social state B is "better" than social state A, if at least one person prefers "B" and no one else opposes it. Another aspect of welfare treats income/goods distribution, including equality, as a further dimension of welfare.
Social welfare refers to the overall welfare of society. With sufficiently strong assumptions, it can be defined as the sum of the welfare of all the individuals in the society. Welfare may be measured either cardinally in terms of "utils" or dollars, or measured ordinally in terms of Pareto efficiency. The cardinal method in "utils" is rarely used in pure theory today. Its main problem is that different kinds of "utiity" cannot easily be summed up without losing the meaning of the measurement. In applied welfare economics money-value estimates are often used. One example of applied welfare econmics is cost-benefit analysis. Money-value estimates are a useful form of measurement where income-distribution effects are factored into the analysis or seem unlikely to change the analysis.
The capabilities approach to welfare argues that freedom - what people are free to do or be - should be included in welfare assessments, and the approach has been particularly influential in development policy circles where the emphasis on multi-dimensionality and freedom has shaped the evolution of the Human Development Index.
Other classifying terms in welfare economics include externalities, equity, justice, inequality, and altruism.

Pope Linus was the second Pope of the Catholic Church, (the official title is Bishop of Rome). He was pope from 67 to 76 C.E.
Linus came from Volterra, Tuscany. He became a follower of Peter. Peter was pleased with Linus and introduced him to the teachings of Christianity. After a time He was conscrated by Peter as a Bishop. He formed a Christian community in Ruvo, Apulia. The location where the community of Linus met is now known as the Crypt of San Cleto. He was also sent to Besancon and brought many people to Christianity.
When Peter was put into prison, Linus became the next leader of the Church. He served at a very dangerous time during the reign of Nero. He converted to Christianity the daughter of a Roman official named Saturinus and was for that reason put into prison and beheaded. He was buried near Peter.
Linus is one of the three popes mentioned by name in the New Testament. He is recognized as a saint. His feast day is 23 September, the same day as his death.

<doc id="435260" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=435260" title="Varistor">
Varistor

A varistor, VDR, "(voltage dependent resistor)" is a type of resistor. It controls the current depending on the voltage.
In these devices resistance drops sharply at a certain threshold voltage. Once the voltage across the device reaches the threshold, there is a breakdown of the electrical structure in the vicinity of the grain boundaries, which results in its electrical resistance dropping from several megohms down to a few hundred ohms. The major advantage of these is that they can dissipate a lot of energy, and they self reset–after the voltage across the device drops below the threshold, its resistance returns to being high. 
This makes them ideal for surge-protection applications. As there is control over the threshold voltage and energy tolerance, they find use in all sorts of applications. The best demonstration of their ability can be found in electrical substations, where they are employed to protect the infrastructure from lightning strikes. They have rapid response, are low maintenance, and do not appreciably degrade from use, making them virtually ideal devices for this application.
They can be used to protect electronics from voltages that could damage components.

Wheathampstead

Wheathampstead is a village and civil parish north of St Albans. It is part of the City and District of St Albans, in Hertfordshire. Its parliamentary constituency is Hitchin and Harpenden. The village is on the River Lea (or Lee), a tributary of the Thames.
The population of Wheathampstead at the time of the 2001 census was 6,058. 
Settlements in this area were made about 50 BC by Belgic invaders. They moved up the rivers Thames and Lea from what is now Belgium. Evidence for them was found in Devil's Dyke, at the eastern side of Wheathampstead. 
The Devil's Dyke earthworks are remains of an ancient settlement of the Catuvellauni. It is thought to have been the tribe's original capital. The capital was moved to Verlamion, later the Roman Verulamium. This became the modern St Albans. 
The Devil's Dyke is reputedly where Julius Caesar defeated Cassivellaunus in 54 BC, although this claim is disputed. The Dyke may have been part of the same defensive rampart as nearby Beech Bottom Dyke. If correct, this would make the area one of the largest and most important British Iron Age settlements.
Later, the village is recorded in the Domesday Book under name "Watamestede". It appears that a church existed at Wheathampstead before the Norman Conquest, as Wheathampstead was given by Edward the Confessor to Westminster Abbey. The original structure was demolished in the reign of Henry III, and the oldest part of the present church dates to about 1280. The main doorways to the church (in the chancel section) and the windows are Early English pointed arches.

George S. Patton slapping incidents

The George S. Patton slapping incidents refer to two events that involved an American general, George S. Patton. These happened during the World War II Allied campaign in Sicily. General Patton slapped two soldiers he thought were cowards who were in hospitals for . The general lost his command. He was sent back to England and played no part in the D-Day landing in Normandy.
George Patton believed it was part of a general's duty to visit his wounded soldiers in hospitals. He did this more than other generals even though he personally found it hard to do. His usual visit included talking to the soldiers and telling them how much he appreciated their courage. His aids followed him pinning medals on soldiers as they went. General Omar Bradly, who knew Patton well, said that when it came to his men Patton was in spite of his manner. 
Growing up, Patton had serious doubts about himself. He came from a long line of military heroes. One of his greatest fears was that he might be a coward in battle. Through his own strength of will he conquered his fear. He expected the same from all the men he commanded. . Any display of fear reminded him of his own earlier problems with fear.
On 3 August 1943 Patton was visiting the 15th Evacuation Hospital. He found a soldier sitting on a supply box. The General asked him what he was there for. The soldier, Private Charles H. Kuhl, said "I guess I just can't take it." The general was immediately angry. He swore at the soldier and slapped him with his gloves. The man had malaria and dysentery. 
A week later at the 93rd Evacuation Hospital the general came upon Private Paul G. Bennet laying on a bed. In reply to Patton's usual question of what was wrong with him, the soldier replied "it's my nerves." The general yelled "What did you say?" Bennet repeated himself. Then Patton angrily swore at the soldier calling him a coward. He hit the soldier and told him he had to return to the front lines. He even reached for his pistol. Patton was still yelling when he left the hospital tent.
When Patton and his army entered Messina (16 August 1943) General Eisenhower wrote him saying he had received word of the slapping incidents. Eisenhower told Patton there was no excuse for losing his temper in front of his soldiers. He said there was no excuse for brutality of the sick and injured. He ordered Patton to publicly apologize to their divisions and to the two men personally. Patton wrote Eisenhower a note of apology. Then he proceeded to address his troops as he was ordered. On 30 August he was giving his public apology for the third and last time to the 3rd Division. Patton was giving his short speech when his troops sensed he was about to apologize. They started chanting "No general, no, no; General, no, no." They cut him off from his apology and would not let him give it. Overcome with emotion Patton left the stage.
The incidents were considered handled by Eisenhower and Army Chief of Staff George Marshall. News reporters were told not to file any stories on the incidents. In November 1943, however, one American columnist, Drew Pearson, filed the story anyway. He accused the Army of a cover-up. The American people, however, still mostly were behind Patton. The Germans were amused at the story and at the Americans. They saw nothing wrong with a general slapping a soldier. But Patton was too valuable to dismiss. So in early January 1944, Eisenhower sent him back to England. There he was placed in command of the First United States Army Group. It was an army that did not exist and was only intended to fool the Germans. The Germans thought Patton would lead the invasion of Europe, whenever it came. For the next six months Patton was on his good behavior. After the D-Day landings, he was given command of the US 3rd Army in Normandy.

Radioactive waste

Radioactive waste is a term used for certain substances that are radioactive and that are no longer useful. Most radioactive waste is a by-product of operating nuclear power plants. Certain treatments in hospitals use radioactive substances. Scientists doing certain kinds of research use radioactive substances. Nuclear weapons also produce radioactive waste. Low-level radioactive wastes are radioactive gases, solids, or liquids that give off small amounts of ionizing radiation. High-level radioactive wastes give off large amounts of ionizing radiation. 
Radioactive waste is dangerous to the environment, and there are many regulations about transporting it, handling it, and processing it in such a way that the dangers are reduced. They can contaminate water and affect the living organisms. Storage of radioactive waste must be guaranteed for thousands of years, until it decays sufficiently to be safe to the environment and its inhabitants. Radioactive waste can be stored by deep geological burial or by dry cask storage. Dry Cask Storage is large cylinders of concrete and steel that are used to hold 10 or more metric tons of high-level radioactive waste. The U.S. currently has no long-term radioactive waste storage site. In 1987 Yucca Mountain, Nevada was a candidate for radioactive waste storage, but was shut down.

Shiprock is the remains of an extinct volcano in the U.S. state of New Mexico. 
Shiprock is composed of fractured volcanic breccia and black dikes of igneous rock. It is the erosional remnant of the throat of a volcano. The exposed rock was probably formed 2,500–3000 feet (750–1,000 meters) below the Earth's surface, but exposed after millions of years of erosion. 
Radiometric dating of the rock shows that the volcanic rocks solidified about 27 million years ago. Shiprock is in the northeastern part of the Navajo Volcanic Field. El Capitan in Monument Valley is another prominent volcanic neck in this field.

South African Navy

The South African Navy is the navy of the South African National Defence Force. The role of the South African Navy is to conduct naval operations in defence of the Republic of South Africa.
The current organisation of the South African Navy dates back to 1 April 1922, when the South African Naval Service (SANS) was created. (However, colonial naval volunteer units date back as far as 1861.) The South African Naval Service was later expanded and renamed to the South African Naval Forces (SANF). In 1951, the South African Naval Forces was renamed to the South African Navy and the ship title HMSAS (His Majesty's South African Ship) was changed to SAS (South African Ship) one year later.
The South African Navy has a strength of 6,104 active military personnel. The navy is divided into a Combat Fleet and a Support Fleet. The Combat Fleet is made up of five Valour-class frigates, three Heroine-class submarines, three Warrior-class patrol vessels, three T-class patrol vessels, three River-class mine countermeasures vessels, and twenty-one Namacurra-class harbour patrol boats. The Support Fleet is made up of one replenishment vessel, one Hecla-class survey vessel, and three tugboats. The navy also includes an infantry-trained special forces unit called the Maritime Reaction Squadron (MRS).

South African National Defence Force

The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) is the military of South Africa.
The SANDF is made up of four branches: the South African Army, the South African Navy, the South African Air Force, and the South African Military Health Service (formerly the South African Medical Service).
The Commander-in-Chief of the military is the President of South Africa, currently Jacob Zuma. The Ministry of Defence and Military Veterans, currently headed by Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, is in charge of political leadership. Military command is in the hands of the General Staff, headed by the Chief of the South African National Defence Force, who is General Solly Shoke.
The history of the SANDF can be traced back to 1912, with the establishment of the Union Defence Force (UDF). In 1957, the Union Defence Force was renamed to the South African Defence Force (SADF). The SADF fought a bloody guerrilla war against the South-West African People's Organisation (SWAPO) and the African National Congress in South-West Africa (now Namibia). SADF forces were also involved in the Angolan Civil War. In 1994, the South African Defence Force was combined with the ANC's Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the PAC's Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA), several Bantustan defence forces, and the self protection units of the Inkatha Freedom Party to form the South African National Defence Force.
Since 1994, South Africa has been trying to develop its military into a professional, well trained and mobile military. The SANDF currently plays a role in peacekeeping in the African continent, in countries such as the DRC and Burundi.

John Berryman

John Berryman (1914–1972) was an important American poet in the second part of the 1900s. He was born in McAlester, Oklahoma October 25, 1914. He was seen as one of the chief poets of confessional poetry.
When John Berryman was born in Oklahoma, his name was John Allyn Smith, Jr.. His father was a banker named John Allyn Smith. His mother was a schoolteacher named Martha. When he was ten years old his family moved to Tampa, Florida. In 1926, when he was twelve years old, his father shot and killed himself. This haunted the poet for the rest of his life.
After his father died, his mother married another banker named John. His last name was Berryman. The poet took his father's name, so he ended up with the same last name as his stepfather. They moved to New York City. John was sent to a private boarding school in Connecticut. He went on to graduate from Columbia College.
The book "Five Young American Poets" had some of his earliest poems alongside other poets like Randall Jarrell. The publisher of this book also published Berryman's first book, "Poems". His next book, "The Dispossessed", was more mature but received mostly bad reviews. When Jarrell reviewed Berryman's book, he wrote that Berryman's poems sounded too much like William Butler Yeats. Berryman later said, "I didn't want to be "like" Yeats; I wanted to "be" Yeats."
In 1947 John Berryman started seeing a married woman while he was married to his first wife. He wrote many sonnets about her, but they were not published until 1967.
In 1950 he wrote a biography of the writer Stephen Crane, who he admired. He also published a book of poems called "Homage to Mistress Bradstreet." This book also featured drawings by the artist Ben Shahn. It was his first book to get attention from people all across the United States of America.
Even though "Homage to Mistress Bradstreet" was successful, Berryman's biggest breakthrough came with "77 Dream Songs" in 1964. This book won the Pulitzer Prize in 1965. Berryman wrote a much longer sequel, "His Toy, HIs Dream, His Rest". This book was just as successful. He later combined the two into one book, "The Dream Songs".
On January 7, 1972, John Berryman killed himself by jumping off the Washington Avenue Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Berryman wrote about shame, like mental illness and lust. He said that he was not writing about himself but about made-up people. Despite this remark, many critics believe Berryman did write about himself. John Berryman's best-known poems were called Dream Songs. He put out the 385 Dream Songs in two books: "77 Dream Songs" and "His Toy, His Dream, His Rest." Later he put them into one book: "The Dream Songs".

Pope Clement I

Pope Clement was the fourth Pope of the Catholic Church, (the official title is Bishop of Rome). He served the early Catholic Church from 88-97 C.E. He was born in Velletri, Latium and came from a very important family. He was the son of a Roman senator, Faustinus, and the cousin of Roman consul Tiberius Flavius Clemens.
He was recognized as a great historian and recorded many important events in his time such as the martyrdom of his predecessors and the settling of disputes among Christians. During a time of trouble within the Christian community, Clement wrote to the church in Corinth, asking them to end their dispute with their fellow christians, which they did. This established the precedent of Popes being the final person to decide the rules within the Church. He either established, or continued the practice of recording the laws and customs of the Church.
Clement's persecution began with Emperor Trajan who sent him to do hard labor in a mine. He used that time to teach his fellow Christians and it was said that during that time he even taughted some pagans in Christianity. He is also credited with performing a miracle during that time. He is know as the "Pope of Convicts".
His martyrdom was described as being tied to an anchor and dragged out to sea.
His relics and the anchor were retrieved and preserved in a church that was submerged in the Black Sea. During part of the year, it can still be seen and entered into today.
This pope has been very highly regarded through the centuries and is still honored today by the Russian Orthodox Catholics in the Ukraine and by all Catholics in their ceremonial liturgy. He is considered a Saint of the church and his feast day is November 23.

Romance (love)

Romance is a feeling of excitement and mystery associated with love. In relationships, it involves a strong emotional attraction towards the other person. A romantic relationship focuses on feelings rather than sex. Romantic love is the opposite of platonic love.
Romance is often strongest at the beginning of relationships. It comes with uncertainty and anxiety that the love may not be returned.
The modern concept of romantic love comes from the medieval ideals of chivalry, as set out in its chivalric romance literature. It was made popular in Western culture by the concept of courtly love. Knights were often said to have had intimate relationships with the noble ladies they served. These relationships were usually not physical. Since marriage was commonly just a formal arrangement without love, courtly love allowed women to be emotionally intimate with a man.
Romance is a major theme found in art, particularly literature and fiction. It is often found in fairy tales, women's fiction and the writings of people like William Shakespeare.

Pope Evaristus

Pope Evaristus is the fifth Pope of the Catholic Church, (the official title is Bishop of Rome). There is very little information about him. He served in Christianity during the years 97-105 C.E.
Author Charles A. Coulombe states that he was a Jew and came from a Jewish family from Antioch, Turkey.
Pope Evaristus is noted for further developing the parishes of the Catholic Church, a work started by Pope Anacletus. He is also credited with ordering that all Churches be consecrated (blessed) by special ceremonies. He created a method of choosing future bishops by the creation of a group which is now known as the College of Cardinals.
He was martyred during the reign of Emperor Hadrian. His feast day is celebrated on October 26.

Einstein's Cross

Einstein's Cross is an image of a quasar which is 8,000,000,000 light years (ly) or 2,500,000,000 parsecs (pc) away.
The quasar sits directly behind ZW 2237+030, Huchra's lens, the lensing galaxy. Four images of the same distant quasar appear around this foreground galaxy due to strong gravitational lensing.
According to its redshift, the quasar is about 8 billion light years from Earth, while the lensing galaxy is only 400 million light years away.
Amateur astronomers are able to see some of the cross using telescopes but it requires extremely dark skies and telescope mirrors with diameters of 18 inches or greater.

HMS Beagle

HMS "Beagle" was a "Cherokee"-class ship of the Royal Navy. It was launched on 11 May 1820 from the Woolwich Dockyard on the River Thames. It is best known for a voyage that carried Charles Darwin.
On 22 May 1826, "Beagle" left to survey bodies of water in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. One of the bodies of water found was named the Beagle Channel after the ship. During the voyage, Captain Pringle Stokes became depressed and shot himself. He died ten days later. Robert FitzRoy became the new captain. Beagle returned to England on 14 October 1830.
On 27 December 1831, the "Beagle" began her second voyage.
Captain FitzRoy did not want to have the stress and loneliness that led to the suicide of the first captain. He looked for someone to go on the voyage to keep him company. The person found was Charles Darwin.
On this voyage, the crew did surveys in South America. "Beagle" returned to Falmouth, Cornwall, England on 2 October 1836.
Darwin kept a diary of the things he saw and did on this voyage. He rewrote it as the book called "Journal and Remarks". The book was published in 1839 as the third volume of the official account of the expedition. It was very popular. It was reprinted many times with different titles. It eventually became known as "The Voyage of the Beagle".
In 1837, "Beagle" went to survey the coast of Australia. Commander John Clements Wickham was in charge. They started with the western coast between the Swan River (modern Perth, Australia) and the Fitzroy River. They then surveyed both shores of the Bass Strait. In May 1839 they sailed north to survey the shores of the Arafura Sea opposite Timor. This voyage ended in 1843.
Many places around the coast were named on this voyage. Many of the places were named for important people or members of the crew. Wickham named Port Darwin in honour of Charles Darwin. A settlement there became the town of Palmerston in 1869, and was renamed Darwin in 1911.
During this survey, the Beagle Gulf was named after the ship.

Companion planting

In gardening and farming, companion planting is the planting of different crops next to each other. It is done to help the crops grow and to use the space available as much as possible.
Depending on the crops chosen, companion planting may encourage processes that help the plants, such as pollination. Some companion plants may help stop pests, such as caterpillars or fungi, from damaging the crop. Some of these, called "trap crops" attract pests away from the crop. Other plants may serve as shelter for the crops.
Many of the basic principles of companion planting were used thousands of years ago in Mesoamerica. From about 8,000 years ago, Native American peoples grew squash, maize and common beans together. The stalk of the corn were there for the beans to climb, and the beans fixed nitrogen, helping the maize.

The 2nd century BC was a century that started the first day of 200 BC and ended the last day of 101 BC. It is considered part of the Classical period of history.
After having won the Second Punic War, the Roman Republic continued expanding by conquering neighbouring territories. It eventually made Greece part of its empire. It also took the coast of North Africa after destroying the city of Carthage at the end of the Third Punic War. In the east, the Seleucid Empire was forced to make concessions to Rome in order to avoid war. Rome came to dominate the Mediterranean Sea during this period. By the end of the century, its army changed from conscription to a voluntary professional force. These changes were known as the Marian Reforms.
In East Asia, China became very successful under the Han Dynasty. Its empire extended from Korea in the east to Vietnam in the South to the borders of what is today Kazakhstan in the west. The Han also try to get help in fighting the Xiongnu from the Yuezhi people in the west. It is also during this century that the first paper is made in China.

Nuclease

A nuclease is an enzyme which cuts the bonds between the nucleotide subunits of nucleic acids. Well known nucleases are deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease.
Nucleases may have the prefix "endo" or "exo" added to the name. Endonucleases break nucleic acid chains somewhere in the middle of the molecule. Exonucleases remove nucleotides from the ends of DNA molecules.
A restriction endonuclease does a specific job. It scans the length of a DNA molecule. Once it finds a particular sequence, it binds to the DNA molecule and makes a cut in each of the two sugar-phosphate backbones. 
Different endonucleases cut in different places, but one endonuclease will always cut a particular base sequence the same way, no matter what DNA molecule it is acting on. Once the cuts have been made, the DNA molecule breaks into fragments. In fact, more than 900 restriction enzymes, some sequence specific and some not, have been isolated from over 230 strains of bacteria since their discovery.
These enzymatic tools were important to scientists who were gathering the tools needed to "cut and paste" DNA molecules. They needed a tool to cut DNA at specific sites, rather than at random sites along the length of the molecule. This way they could cut DNA molecules in a predictable way.
This whole field of research started many years ago with the Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment.

Aretino Records

Aretino was an American record label. It was in business from about 1907 to 1914. Aretino was started by Arthur J. O’Neill. He started many record and phonograph businesses in the Chicago area. O’Neill named this company in honor of Guido Aretino, an 11th-century Italian monk.
Aretino is an odd type of record because the hole in the center is very large compared to the normal size. It is the largest ever for a record that was made for people to use in their houses. Like many of O'Neill's other companies, Aretino was run as a premium scheme. A phonograph (record player) was offered for not much money. However, this record player could only play Aretino records because it came with a 3-inch spindle. O’Neill also offered adapters for Aretino discs. These allowed the discs to be played on record players that had normal spindles, or even on a Busy Bee machine (another O’Neill brand) which had two spindles instead of one.
Aretino did not make any of its own recordings: it borrowed masters from other companies. The first series of Aretino records had music on only one side of the disc. They were each given a catalog number beginning with the letter A. The music was recorded on them by Leeds & Catlin. Leeds and Catlin also made a group of records for Aretino with catalog numbers starting with the letter D. These records have a recording on both sides. They are very hard to find now. Leeds & Catlin was later shut down by court order for patent infringement. After that, Aretino records were made for a short time by two record companies named Hawthorne & Sheble and Zonophone. These companies kept making records which only had music on one side of the record. They also kept using catalog numbers beginning with "A".
It was not long after this that Columbia became the maker of these records. No other companies made records for Aretino after Columbia began to make them. These records have a catalog number that begins with the letter "D" and then numbers that are larger than 500. They have music on both sides. Of all Aretino records, these are the most common. Most records from this time period have a diameter of 10 inches. Columbia also made a group of records for Aretino that are 12 inches in diameter. These are very hard to find. They have catalog numbers with the letter "A" at the beginning. Aretino stopped making anything after the year 1914.
The music on the Aretino label was like most music from those years. Some artists on Aretino are Henry Burr, William F. Denny, Byron G. Harlan, Ada Jones, Billy Murray, Vess Ossman, Steve Porter, Cal Stewart, and Bert Williams.

Well, I think Kennedy's warning was appropriate. The criticisms of her work were objective, based on defects seen in the articles, not upon the editor personally. The criticisms were: lack of citations for biogs of living people, lack of appropriate simplification, and changing the meaning of key statements so that the text was inaccurate. The user has put up many new pages, which is something we do want. But it's all pointless if the pages do not meet minimum requirements. The user could, and IMO should, have done much less much more carefully. () 11:50, 1 March 2014 (UTC)

I believe that User:Centaur is a sockpuppet of User:DeFacto. DeFacto made a few edits on SimpleWP in January 2007 to the article Speed limit. In April 2012 he was been banned from enWP indefinitely. The discussion leading up to his enWP ban can be seen . In particular may I draw to attention Ron Ritzman's comment about DeFacto's filibustering. 
Since then has launched many sockpuppets on enWP - the . Most of those sockpuppet have been directed against me, usually in articles concerning the metric system. (I have taken four such articles to GA status in enWP). As an IP editor he tried to an for which I was largely responsible - even though this article has been commended by other editors and the article was on the topic of imperial and customary units of measure, not metric units.
A sockpuppet investigation was published against his incarnation as Passy2 on 19 February 2014 and he was blocked on 21 February 2014. Unusually for him, he did not contest the accusation. On 20 February though, Centaur created an account on SimpleWP. One of his first changes was to add an image to the article Kilometres per hour. I believe that his interest in Speed limit in 2007 coupled with my interaction with DeFacto on enWP and the timing of his account creation backs up my suspicion that Centaur and DeFacto are one and the same person.
His comments regarding the article Metric system that were made and the text changes here suggest to me that he is looking to sabotage this article. This is very much in line with the style that he used on enWP under the identity User:Bill le Conquérant () in which he made a number of useful additions to Wikipedia as a cover to his strong anti-metric stance.
I realise that the indefinite banning order applied at enWP does not apply here, but I feel that the disruption he is dragging in from enWP into SimpleWP should be nipped in the bud. Please take whatever action is appropriate. () 22:15, 2 March 2014 (UTC)

I've been looking at to see what could be cleaned up. The top item there is the nonexistent article "Telecommunications of Nasal Sprays from Venus (9*6=42)". It has 698 links. The links come from a signature previously used by . I'm not linking it here to avoid making it 699 links, but you can see it at the top of . I'd like to unlink these to help clean up the list. I told the user I wanted to unlink them, and he/she did not object. I am letting you know because a lot of the links are on archive pages, which we normally don't change. Most of the links are on user talk pages, but there are also links on user talk page archives, other talk pages and archives, old RfDs, requests for permission pages, and possibly others. You can take a look at to see everything that links to it. Does anyone have a problem with me unlink this item on all these pages? -- () 02:30, 2 March 2014 (UTC)
I posted here instead of at Simple Talk because I was first most concerned about the issue of changing archives, which are not supposed to be changed. If people think I should also post at Simple Talk because I would be changing user pages, I can do that, too. I imagine that many of the affected users don't watch Simple Talk, but at least some would see it.
I wonder if I should do the change under my bot account, to try to avoid all the "your talk page has been updated" notifications. Would anyone have an issue with that if I visually check each edit? -- () 18:38, 2 March 2014 (UTC)
Seeing no objections, I'm going ahead with this. Thanks to all who commented. -- () 06:35, 5 March 2014 (UTC)

Please do something about User:Centaur disrupting the articles Metric system, Litre and System of units. 
I believe that Centaur is a sockpuppet of User:DeFacto. DeFacto made a few legitimate changes on siWiki in 2007 but worked mainly on enWiki.He has now been banned from enWiki, but has created many sockpuppet accounts. He is continually trying to discredit anything to do with metrication and also trying to undermine my activities. He has recently followed me onto siWiki and is acting in the same way as he acted on enWiki. In particular, he is now trying to sabotage my efforts to get the article Metric system accepted as a good article.
Using Keynes as an example of units
Centaur has asserted that just because John Maynard Keyne's had a chapter entitled "Units" that the book is a useful addition to this article. If anybody reads chapters 4, 5 and 6 they will see that Keynes argues that the absence of meaningful units of measure in economics makes it difficult to verify his arguments experimentally. Centaur refuses to accept this fact. I believe that he is trying to antagonise me by his continual refusal to acknowledge that Keynes' book has no place in this article. 
I find it significant that in his incarnation as he worked on the article yet he failed to see that OIML was one of the publishers of "International vocabulary of metrology" (VIM), the publication on which the article System of units is based.
Merger proposal
Centaur has proposed that this article should be merged with the article System of measurement on grounds that the two cover the same topic. Systems of units deal with units of measure – metres, feet, inches, kilograms etc. Systems of measurement deal with data gathering systems and includes not only units of measure, but also inherent errors, measurement devices, data recording etc. Systems of measurement also deals with area where systems of units are not applicable such as economics, phycology etc. I believe that his merger proposal is a device to cause disruption.
Centaur has a track record of trying to merge articles in order to destroy them. Examples include while hiding behind an IP address. This action of his caused the delay of a DYK nomination for several days. Another attempt was in his dual incarnations as and .
I believe that Centaur is trying to goad me by persisting in making inappropriate references to the "1791 metric system". While it might be true that many books make reference to the metric system having been introduced into France in 1791, they do not define what they mean by "having been introduced" (or similar such phrases). Books that give more detail outline the following chronology:
Centaur is persisting in writing as though metric system was an established fact in 1791. I believe that he is doing this out of sheer bloody-mindedness..
I believe that Centaur is trying to sabotage this article in order to wind me up and to prevent it from being classed as a "good article".
"System of measurement" or "system of units"
When I changed the text "The metric system is a system of measurement" to "The metric system is a system of units of measurement", he reverted. (See System of units)
Blatant POV in his opposition to metrication
Centaur has taken every opportunity to run the metric system down. In this version of the article, the degree of POV by Centaur is excessive as is the use of unverified sensational language ("…the police…."). It is unnecessary to detail the opposition to the degree that he has done – the article is about the metric system as a whole: the problems that French had two hundred years ago warrants a passing mention but nothing more. For the record, the section on the problems in France after the metric system was introduced runs to 328 words while 173 words are devoted to metrication in the United Kingdom and 286 to metrication in the United States. (Since I made these measurements, he has reduced the UK and US sections further. )
When I first crossed swords with DeFacto, I tried to explain to him that this addition was not very helpful – the survey to which he referred was an in-house survey while the strawberry promotion was a promotion for a single item by a single chain store. The material was hardly relevant. The discussion, or rather DeFacto gaming the system covered the following items (no need to read them, just measure them with a ruler):
The result was DeFacto being banned from enWiki.
I do not want to go through this tedious argument with him on every point that he tried to make.
After he was banned, he created a . I have been the main target of his disruption. 
There are a number of indicators suggesting that DeFacto and Centaur are one and the same.
Each of the above on its own could be put down to coincidence, but when viewed together, I believe that they present overwhelming evidence that DeFacto and Centaur are one and the same person. Finally, why is Centaur using a new account when he already has a valid account on siWiki? Is he trying to hide something?-- () 14:10 13 March 2014 (UTC) 
Additionally, Centaur's first few days on Wikipeida appeared to be quite productive. Within 24 hours of creating an account, he spotted that I had overlooked a copyright issue. On the same day he inserted an image into the article kilometre. Quite remarkable for a beginner, unless of course he had been previously been editing on either simpleWiki or enWiki. If he had been editing previously, what was his username? Was it DeFacto (or one of his sockpuppets)? () 22:40, 13 March 2014 (UTC)
First of all, you have both been edit warring. Because of that, effective immediately, I am imposing a topic ban on both of you: you are both forbidden to make any content edits related to measurement until I (and/or any other admins who want to help) have time to analyze the edits that you both have made. I will leave a message to this effect on both of your talk pages. If either of you violate this restriction, you will be blocked from all editing until an admin has evaluated the issues mentioned in this complaint. It might take some time for that evaluation to be done, given the number of edits made.
As far as Centaur being the same person as DeFacto: I do not see anything at the "series of sockpuppets" link provided by Martinvl that says they were determined to be the same. If I am missing that, please point out where it was stated. Unless I see evidence of that, I am not going to consider anything related to DeFacto on other Wikipedias.
As for the nomination of Metric system as a good article, I am putting that on hold. With the article changing so much, it is impossible for editors to evaluate it for possible good article status.
The one thing I have noticed so far is that some of the references given for disputed information in these articles are not sufficient. When there are disputes as there are in this case, it is not enough to give just a book name and author. More specific information is needed, such as a page number or chapter, so that people who want to look up the information or verify something can find the referenced information.
That's all for now. I will get back to you as I evaluate each article. -- () 02:03, 13 March 2014 (UTC)
Both of you need to behave yourselves. No more bickering, no more attacking each other, no more complaining about each other, no more accusing each other of vandalism or anything else. The more you do that, the more I have to review before I can get back to looking at the actual articles, and the longer your topic ban will stay in effect. Consider this a warning that the scope of your ban might be extended if you can't control yourselves. I don't have unlimited time to spend on Wikipedia, y'know, and I'm not spending all of my Wikipedia time on this issue.
As far as whether Centaur and DeFacto are the same person, I am not convinced by either of your arguments. In any case, I don't really care: I am only looking at the changes to the three articles listed. Now please clean up your acts and let me get back to that. -- () 07:28, 14 March 2014 (UTC)

It is worth noting that when the IP addresses used by this user is blocked at English Wikipedia, (s)he moves onto Simple English Wikipedia like many other cross-wiki vandals do.

If this user does not respond to any of the messages and if this type of pointless edits are not stopped, this IP should be blocked, imo. I do not believe that this user is acting in good faith (1. has been repeatedly warned at enwp and sewp 2. has failed to stop these edits even after warning 3. has been blocked several times at enwp). Even if these edits were made in good-faith, they are more disruptive and making the articles more complex. Also edits such as (totally opposite to the sources there) convinces me even more that these are not good faith edits. My answer to the original post is yes.

Recently i made an edit on the article old city jerusalem ,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_City_(Jerusalem)
The edit was about the population of the old city of Jerusalem and the ethnic and religious distribution, which is common when you you talk about demographics or population to mention it.
Then two users undid my edit and removed the mention of the ethnic and religious distribution and used the division of population by the quarters of the city (the city has four quarter ) instead, without providing any valid reason despite being requested that by me in the talk page.
I believe that the reason behind their vandalism is political
The interesting thing is that we both are using the same reference and they dont object to it.
I believe that the arab israeli conflict is a very controversial subject where it is really difficult to find an accurate and independent article even here in Wikipedia, but i am trying to improve as much as i can.
I am requesting you to take action and protect the article in the right version and not allow vandalism in it anymore.

I have contacting you today to inform you about the article "coolie" this article is very inaccurate and offensive because it classes collies as slaves when it is a fact that collies were indentured laborers and indentured laborers are not slaves. The majority of this article needs to be re-written and I just wanted to formally file a complaint.
I have provided several credible sources from encyclopedia yet unreliable blogs are being used in this article.
First of all the Category must be changed from Slavery to Indentured Worker. If a category was not created for Indentured Worker then in should be. Coolie should not be lumped in the category of slavery because it is false. Second the etymology for coolie is hired laborer or wages. And kuli in Turkish means hireling. Many people of Indian and Chinese background took exception to this article because they knew that a lot of the subject matter in this article is false and misleading. Indians have land today because of the work that they did; slavery and coolie cannot be compared.
Coolies were given wages, land, and houses for their labor. Generally speaking people today are not even given this. This resulted in a lot of jealousy and anger from African slaves towards coolies and perhaps rightfully so. Indian coolies were paid about $45 dollars a day plus food and clothing.
http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/136194/coolie http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/research-guides/indian-indentured-labour.htm http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2013/11/25/247166284/a-history-of-indentured-labor-gives-coolie-its-stinghttp: http://www.sahistory.org.za/politics-and-society/anti-indian-legislation-1800s-1959
80% of the immigrants who came to the Chesapeake Bay colonies were white, European indentured laborers. Indentured laborers were: White Europeans, Chinese, Indians, and other Asian ethnic groups and these people were not slaves. "Coolie" needs to be listed under a category called Indentured Worker or it should not be in a category at all. Coolie should simply not be listed under the category of Slavery because that is very false and is misleading to the public. How do I remove "coolie" from the category Slavery or get a new category created entitled Indentured Laborer? https://sites.google.com/site/rydenonushistory/home/directory-study-guides/southern-english-colonies Also the etymology of coolie is "hired laborer" or an "unskilled Asian Laborer" There are several other etymology used in the present article that is not relevant and they must be removed. Can you please remove this. Thank you for your help. http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=coolie http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/coolie
To me it is obvious that this article was written to degrade peoples whose ancestry goes back to Asia. Coolies and Europeans were both indentured laborers. They were majority unskilled workers and a minority of skilled workers that were paid.
Coolies were paid and given land in exchange for work. How could this possibly be classed as slavery? Most WHITE Europeans that came to the United States when this country first started were indentured servants. 80-90% of all white Europeans that came to the Chesapeake Region of the United States were Indentured Servants. 80%-90%... that's a large number right... Over 60% of all white colonial immigrants were indentured servants... are you saying that all these white people were slaves?
Check out the source from encyclopedia... http://www.answers.com/topic/indentured-servant
Coolie / Indentured Servitude should not be classed as slavery and that is a fact. This must be edited. I would like to be contacted by an administrator who can remove "Coolie" and "Indentured Servitude" from the Slavery Category.

I asked to use the standard warning levels, after he had started with final warnings with some users. He replied that he was following procedures that were set forth by admins in the past. Would any and all willing admins please comment at and let me know if I am indeed missing something? Please reply there only about procedures that are already in place: I am looking to learn if there are procedures and practices I'm unaware of, not to discuss what the procedures should be. We could certainly have a conversation about the latter, but elsewhere, please.

<doc id="435808" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=435808" title="Shotgun Sports">
Shotgun Sports

Shotgun Sports is a competitive shooting sport involving shotguns. Shotgun Sports include several different events, each with different rules. The general goal of a shotgun event is to break a clay target, but the targets are thrown in different manners depending on the game.
In sporting clays, a shooter will walk through a course generally consisting of ten stations. Each station will have two targets that are thrown as a true pair or as a report pair(one thrown on pull command and one thrown on gun fire). Sporting clay courses are generally scored out of a 100.
Trap is another clay target event. A game of trap is scored out of 25, and a full trap event generally consists of 4 trap games, or 100 targets. In this event, a team of 5 shooters lines up behind a trap house. Inside the trap house is a pivoting arm that throws a clay out at a random direction when 'pull' is called. To vary the difficulty of this game, shooters can stand farther back from the house.
In the skeet shooting event, a shooter moves around a field in a semi circle. Skeet, like Trap, is also a 25 target game, with skeet events generally consisting of four games. There are 8 stations on the field. On one end of a field is a high house, and on the other end of the field, there is a low house. On station 1, 2, 6, and 7 a high single, low single, and double are shot. On stations 3, 4, and 5 a high single and low single are shot. Station 8 is in between the high and low house. At this station, the shooter faces the high house, shoots a high single, then turns and faces the low house to shoot a low single. This totals 24 targets. The last target, to make 25, comes from what is referred to as the option. The option is a target that is shot after the first target that is missed. If the shooter misses the high bird on station 1, the high bird is shot again. If the shooter makes it all the way around the field without missing a bird, a second low single is shot on station 8, totaling a perfect 25.

Chr

In computing, chr is a type of file format commonly used for graphics (i.e. 3D Max Characters and Homebrew NES Dev Graphics) and character sets.
chr files are used to draw 8x8 tiles for homebrew NES development. To draw graphics for the NES such as backgrounds or sprites, they must be pieced together using 8x8 pixel tiles constrained to 4 colors.
The contents of a chr file can be summed up as multiple lines of bit strings. For example, take the first line of the chr file for the game Super Mario Bros.
When reading the file, it is interpreted as 2 equal length bit strings, such as
The position of these 2 bit strings represent a pixel in an 8x8 tile, going in row-column order. The color of the pixel can be found out using a simple formula:
The color is irrelevant because it is chosen through the code by the programmer with the attribute table, so it is the bit combination that is significant and there is no storage of color values

Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania

The Perelman School of Medicine (Penn Med), is the medical school of the University of Pennsylvania. It is an Ivy League school located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Opened in 1765, Penn Med is the first and oldest medical school in the United States. Today, the Perelman School of Medicine is a chief place of biological and medical research and education. It is one of the country's top medical schools. The school ranks among the highest recipients of the National Institutes of Health research awards.
John Morgan earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the College of Philadelphia (now called the University of Pennsylvania. He then earned Doctor of Medicine (MD) from the University of Edinburgh Medical School in Scotland. In 1765, after five years training in Edinburgh and touring Europe, Dr. Morgan returned to Philadelphia. There he opened the United States' first medical school at the University of Pennsylvania. He planned for the school to be one of the best medical schools in the country and the world. Dr. Morgan copied many teaching methods from his medical school.
The School of Medicine's professors were known internationally. Some of these were: Benjamin Rush, Philip Syng Physick, Robert Hare, William pepper, and Joseph Leidy. In 1847, a convention of medical doctors started the American Medical Association. The first President was Nathaniel Chapman, a professor at the School.

<doc id="435860" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=435860" title="Constant function">
Constant function

In mathematics, a constant function is a function whose output value is the same for every input value. For example, the function formula_1 is a constant function because the value of  formula_2  is 4 regardless of the input value formula_3 (see image).
Formally, a constant function "f"("x"):R→R has the form  formula_4. Usually we write formula_5  or just  formula_6. 
Example: The function  formula_7  or just  formula_8  is the specific constant function where the output value is  formula_9. The domain is all real numbers ℝ. The codomain is just {4}. Namely, "y"(0)=4, "y"(−2.7)=4, "y"(π)=4... No matter what value of "x" is input, the output is "4". 
In the context where it is defined, the derivative of a function measures the rate of change of function (output) values with respect to change in input values. A constant function does not change, so its derivative is 0. This is often written:  formula_12 . 
Example:  formula_13  is a constant function. The derivative of "y" is the identically zero function   formula_14  .
The converse (opposite) is also true. That is, if the derivative of a function is zero everywhere, then the function is a constant function.
Mathematically we write these two statements: 
A function "f" : "A" → "B" is a constant function if "f"("a") = "f"("b") for every "a" and "b" in "A".
Real-world example: A store where every item is sold for 1 euro. The domain of this function is "items in the store". The codomain is "1 euro".
Example: Let "f" : "A" → "B" where "A"={X,Y,Z,W} and "B"={1,2,3} and "f"("a")=3 for every "a"∈"A". Then "f" is a constant function.
Example: "z"("x","y")=2 is the constant function from "A"=ℝ² to "B"=ℝ where every point ("x","y")∈ℝ² is mapped to the value "z"=2. The graph of this constant function is the horizontal plane (parallel to the "x"0"y" plane) in 3-dimensional space that passes through the point (0,0,2).
Example: The polar function "ρ"("φ")=2.5 is the constant function that maps every "angle" φ to the "radius" ρ=2.5. The graph of this function is the circle of radius 2.5 in the plane.
There are other properties of constant functions. See on English Wikipedia

Inline skating is a form of skating. It involves a person moving across land using shoes that have wheels on the bottom. It is similar to roller skating, except that the wheels are smaller and arranged in a single line. It is also called rollerblading after the brand of skates, "Rollerblade".
Inline skates usually have between 2 to 5 polyurethane wheels. They are arranged in a single line. This allows for faster speeds than roller skates.

The Voyage of the Beagle

The Voyage of the Beagle is the usual title of the book written by Charles Darwin. He first published it in 1839 as his Journal and Remarks.
The title refers to the second survey expedition of the ship HMS "Beagle". The ship set sail from Plymouth Sound on 27 December 1831 under the command of Captain Robert FitzRoy R.N.
The expedition was originally planned to last two years, but it lasted almost five. The "Beagle" did not return until 2 October 1836. Darwin spent most of this time exploring on land (three years and three months on land; 18 months at sea). The ship dropped him off at various places and picked him up later.
The book is a vivid and exciting travel memoir as well as a detailed scientific field journal. It includes biology, geology, and anthropology. Darwin's observations were written at a time when Western Europeans were exploring and charting the whole world. Although Darwin revisited some areas during the expedition, for clarity the chapters of the book are ordered by places and locations rather than by date. 
Darwin's notes made during the voyage include comments illustrating his thinking. Looking at the plants, animals, rocks and fossils, he ran across questions which he could not answer at the time. On his way back, ideas began in his mind which he developed later as his theory of evolution by natural selection. The second edition of 1845 includes some suggestion of this.
Later, he realised he had made a big mistake in not noting which islands some specimens from the Galapagos Islands were found on. He knew this was a mistake because he had sensed how islands were rather like the higher parts of mountains, which also have many unique species. The idea we now know as geographical speciation was beginning to form in his mind. Darwin opened his secret 'transmutation' notebook (Notebook 'B') in July 1837, less than a year after the "Beagle" returned to England.

Candy floss

Candy floss (or candyfloss) is sugar that is spun with air. It is also called cotton candy or fairy floss. It is spun in machines. When spun, a small amount of sugar creates a much larger serving of candy floss. This is because it is mostly air. It is usually served on a stick or in a bag. Food colouring is sometimes used to change the natural white colour. Flavour is also sometimes added. Candy floss is often sold at fairs or circuses.
Candy floss was first made in Europe in the 18th century. At that time, spun sugar was expensive. The average person could not afford it. Machines to spin the sugar were invented in 1897 by William Morrison and John C. Wharton. They introduced it at the World's Fair in 1904, under the name "Fairy Floss". It was very successful. They sold 68,655 boxes at 25 cents each box (equivalent to US$6 per box today).

Bed (geology)

In geology a bed is the smallest division of rock or deposit. It is a geologic formation or stratigraphic rock series marked by well-defined divisional planes (bedding planes) separating it from layers above and below. 
A bed is the smallest lithostratigraphic unit. It ranges in thickness from a centimetre to several metres. It can be distinguished from beds above and below it by rock or mineral type and particle size. The term is usually applied to sedimentary strata, but may also be used for volcanic flows or ash layers.
In a quarry, bedding is a term used for a structure occurring in granite and similar rocks which allows them to split in well-defined planes horizontally or parallel to the land surface.
In geotechnical engineering a bedding plane often forms a discontinuity that may have a large influence on the mechanical behaviour (strength, deformation) of soil and rock masses. This is important in, for example, tunnel, foundation, or slope construction.

Mog, is the main character in a series of books for children. The author is Judith Kerr. In the series Mog was well loved by Mr and Mrs Thomas (Mog's owners) and their two children Nicky and Debbie. In the books Mog, a cat, would often get into a difficult situation with a new character or event.
Mog died of old age in the final book, "Goodbye, Mog" and goes to heaven. It was published in 2002. It is not usual for a pet to die in stories for young children just learning to read. Kerr said ""I don't think it was so much about killing off Mog, as rather doing something about dying...and being remembered."
In November 2015, Mog came back as a CGI character for the 2015 Christmas video advert for the supermarket, Sainsbury's. In "Mog's Christmas Calamity" Mog accidentally starts a fire in her house after having a bad dream. She saves her family by calling firefighters by running across the telephone and dialing the emergency number. She is a hero for saving her owners, and is later given an egg as a treat. A special plush Mog and book version of the story were sold at Sainsbury's, with all profits being donated to Save the Children's child literacy work.

Mamdouh Eldamaty

Mamdouh Mohamed Gad Eldamaty (; born December 6, 1961 in Cairo) is Professor of Egyptology at the Department of Archaeology, Faculty of Arts, Ain Shams University in Cairo. On May 15, 2011, he became Cultural Counselor and Head of Educational Mission at the Embassy of Egypt in Berlin.
He attended high school in Cairo. In 1979, he registered at the Faculty of Archeology, Cairo University. In July 1981, he was looking for a summer job as a student. He went to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and met with Dr. Mohamed Saleh, the vice director of the museum. He worked there for one month. In summer 1982, he worked at the museum again for a summer student job. He did work that brought him in contact with all departments of the museum. In 1983, he graduated at the Faculty of Archeology, Cairo University.
After his graduation, he worked again for the museum for one month for free. After that, he joined the restoration team of the Coptic Museum for several months. In January 1984, he started his 15 month long conscription service. He worked at the museum again from April 1985 to September 1987. He rejoined his Faculty at Cairo University to resume higher studies. The thesis of his Master's Degree was "St- Meskhnet hall at Dendara Temple, linguistic and cultural study" under supervision of Prof. Abdelhalim Noureldin and partnership of Dr. Ola El-Aguizy.
Through his work at the Museum he became acquainted to many Egyptologists and archaeologists who visited the Museum. Among those was Prof. Erich Winter at Trier University, who along with his wife visited Egypt in 1987 and were accompanied by the young Mamdouh Eldamaty during their 3-day visit to Siwa Oasis. This new contact proved to be quite useful as Prof. Winter encouraged the young Egyptologist to continue his studies under his supervision at the Department of Egyptology at Trier University.
In October 1988 he worked as a curator at Faculty of Archaeology Museum of Cairo University. During his work he got his Master Degree in April 1989 in Egyptology from the same faculty. Immediately he left Egypt for Germany on leave to prepare his PhD. 
Trying his luck without any state sponsored scholarship it was rather difficult to get an entry visa to study in Germany without guarantor. Thanks to the help and support of his Professor and guarantor, Prof. Dr. Mohamed Saleh, an entry visa was issued and he started his German courses at Cologne University as soon as he arrived to Germany. He supported his life by working during summer vacation. While in Cologne he held correspondence with Trier University. He got an acceptance from Trier University, which he joined from winter semester 1989/ 1990. He started his Trier residence by learning German until he acquired the ‘Prüfung zum Nachweis der Deutsch Sprachkenntnis’ that qualified him to regular study at the university. He registered for Egyptology as major subject with classical archaeology and ethnology as minor subject in summer semester 1991.
At the winter semester 1992/ 93 he registered for his PhD with thesis ‘Sokar- Osiris- Kapelle im Tempel von Dendera’ for which he received a study scholarship from Ministry of Culture at Rhineland Palatia that enabled him to conclude his study in June 1995. 
During his stay in Germany, on February 26th 1992 he married Aida Abdelghany Ahmed, who studied sociology at Zagazig University. She accompanied him to Germany where gave birth to their first daughter, Mariam (11.Feb. 1993) in Trier.
Having concluded his PhD, he returned to Egypt in September 1995 but kept visiting Trier frequently in the years 1996, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2004 and 2007 in order to follow recent publications and studies on Egyptology.
Back in Cairo, where the family got a son and another daughter, he resumed his work for the Faculty’s Museum until January 1996.
Starting from January 1996 he started as lecturer for Egyptology at Faculty of Tourism and Hotels, Cairo University, Fayoum Branch. Upon founding an archaeological department at the Faculty of arts, Ain Shams University in August 1998, he moved to the new department as a lecturer for Egyptology until end of 2001.
At the beginning of 2001 he was appointed Director General of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, a post that he held until End of January 2004.
During his directorship the Museum witnessed several far reaching activities, developing its cellar (April 2001), restoration of old records of the Museum (May 2001), preparing for the second chamber for royal mummies (June 2001) and establishing restoration laboratory for papyrus, in cooperation with Corrado Basile, Director of Istituto Internazionale del Papiro, Siracusa in Italy (March 2003).
In July 2001 he laid forward a concept for the centennial of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, which included several projects to promote and develop the old institution. This concept was approved by Dr. Gaballa Ali Gaballa, the then Secretary General of the Higher Council for Monuments and by the Minister of Culture as well.
These activities were performed in late 2002 in the time of the successor of Gaballa, Dr. Zahi Hawas, who gave this ceremony special attention.
Eldamaty was assigned also to supervise the external exhibitions committee from May 2002 till February 2004.
Having concluded his assignment at the Egyptian Museum he returned to his main work in teaching at the Ain Shams University. There he got the post of associate professor of Egyptology at the Faculty of Arts from 25.03.2001 till 20.08.2006. As of 21.08.2006 he became a full professor of Egyptology and presided over the archaeological Department of Faculty of Arts at Ain Shams University from 12.09.2006 till 12.09.2009.
Besides he was assigned to head the college center for studies, consultations and training from 15.10.2008 till 13.10.2009 when he overtook the post of director of open education center from 22.03.2009 till 15.11.2009.
Starting from 13.09.2009 till 14.05.2011 he was the Dean of Faculty of Arts at the Ain Shams University. During his deanship he supervised the project for sustainable development and qualifying for Accreditation. This sustainable development specified certain criteria for selection of university cadres, which was approved by the college council, albeit not by the university council due to the political conditions accompanying the Arab spring in January 2011.
Following the revolution he organized the first election process in Egyptian universities to choose his successor as Dean of the Faculty in March 2011, as he left the country on 15.05.2011 in the capacity of cultural counselor at the Egyptian Embassy to Berlin and head of educational mission there. At this post he supervises all Egyptian students in Germany, Netherlands, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway.

Solid geometry

Solid geometry is the geometry of three-dimensional Euclidean space. It includes the measurements of volumes of various solid figures (three-dimensional figures). These include pyramids, cylinders, cones, spheres, and prisms.
It is Euclidean geometry, but not plane geometry. Points are defined as a defined position on a sphere. A "staight line" is the shortest path between two points which stays on the surface of the sphere. 
Euclid's account of spherical geometry is in his Elements volumes XIXIII containing solid geometry, and in his lesser-known work the "Phaenomena", which includes 25 geometric propositions. The actual discoveries were often made by others. 
The Pythagoreans dealt with the regular solids, like the cube and the sphere. The pyramid, prism, cone and cylinder were not studied until the Platonists. Eudoxus proved the pyramid and cone have one-third the volume of a prism and cylinder on the same base and of the same height.
The equations for areas and volumes in two and three dimensions was proved by Archimedes. One of Archimedes' works was called "On the sphere and the cylinder". He asked that a carving of the two solid figures be placed on his tomb. He specified a "right circular cylinder with height equal to its circumference" because he had used this in his proof.

Not proven

Not proven is a type of verdict in Scottish law. Out of the country, the "not proven" verdict may be referred to as the Scottish verdict, and in Scotland itself it may be referred to colloquially as the bastard verdict, which was a term coined by Sir Walter Scott, who was sheriff in the court of Selkirk.
Scottish law is distinct from English law, and this is one of the differences. Juries may convict with a guilty verdict or they may acquit (see below)). A criminal case jury consists of 15 jurors, and make their decision by a simple majority vote: eight votes are necessary and sufficient for the verdict "guilty", which has replaced the older verdict "proven".
In Scotland there are two forms of acquittal:

Sacrum

In humans, the sacrum is a large, triangular bone. It is at the bottom of the spine and the upper and back part of the pelvis. 
It fits like a wedge between the two hip bones. Its upper part connects with the last lumbar vertebra, and bottom part with the coccyx (tailbone). During the first half of life these bones gradually fuse together.
The sacrum is concave facing forward, and tilted forward. The sacrum connects with four bones:

Outstanding Eagle Scout Award

The NESA Outstanding Eagle Scout Award (NOESA) is a distinguished service award of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). It is awarded to an Eagle Scout by the for distinguished service to his profession and community. He must be recommended by his local BSA council, NESA committee, Scout executive and council president.
A council may present one NOESA per year plus one award for every 100 Eagle Scout awards above of 200 awards presented to youth the previous year. The Distinguished Eagle Scout Award (DESA) is a similar distinguished award, but requires twenty-five years as an Eagle Scout. NOESA is not required for the DESA award, but DESA recipients may not receive the NOESA.
The award consists of a round gold pendant with the NOESA emblem in silver. It is suspended from a blue ribbon. The NOESA emblem is in the shape of the NESA logo. It is round with a descending knot, with an eagle in flight and the word NOESA. A smaller pin-on version of the NOESA emblem may be worn on the Eagle Scout square knot patch on the Scout uniform. A lapel pin version of the NOESA emblem may be worn on the lapel when not in uniform. The recipient is also presented with a certificate.
The NOESA was introduced during BSA'a 100th Anniversary year with the first 152 awards being made in 2011 by the National Eagle Scout Association. This was on the recommendation of local council NESA Committees. In 2012, an additional 179 were awarded bringing the total to 331. The award was created to recognize notable Eagle Scouts who had either performed their distinguished service closer to home (at the local, state, or regional level) or who were known nationally, but had not yet been an Eagle for 25-years: a requirement for the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.

2013–14 Cambodian protests

Cambodian protests or Anti-government protests, have been going on in Cambodia since July 2013. Demonstrations in Phnom Penh have taken place against the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen. These were because many reasons, including widespread claims of election fraud during the Cambodian general election of 2013. Protesters want the minimum wage raised to $160 a month. There is also resentment over Vietnamese influence in Cambodia. Also, Cambodia is a very poor country and the government is not doing much to address the issues. The main opposition party, CNRP (Cambodia National Rescue Party), refused to participate in parliament after the elections. Major demonstrations took place all through December 2013. The government took action in January 2014. This led to the deaths of 4 people and the clearing of the main protest camp.
Hun Sen has been the prime minister of Cambodia for 28 years. He is the leader of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP). In 2013 he was challenged by Sam Rainsy leader of the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP). On 28 July 2013 general elections were held in Cambodia. The ruling Cambodian People's Party claimed victory by winning 68 seats in Parliament. The Cambodia National Rescue Party won 55 seats. They then rejected the election results and boycotted the opening of parliament. The CNRP claimed there had been irregularities with the voting. The European Union (E.U.) and the United States also expressed concern about possible fraud. The international non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch called for an 'independent commission' to investigate charges of election fraud.
Security police clashed with Cambodian protesters when the police blocked the two main roads near the Kbal Thnal Bridge leading into Phnom Penh. Police shot and killed one protester wearing a yellow headband with the word, “We demand Justice”. Three others were seriously injured. Ten people were arrested. Police used firearms, tear gas and against the protesters. The protesters smashed a barrier in the middle of a road. They also threw rocks, shoes and other objects at the police. One policeman was injured. This clash happened the day before the scheduled talks between Prime Minister Hun Sen and CRNP leader Sam Rainsy.
A woman was shot and nine others were wounded when clothing workers in Phnom Penh protested . About 100 police blocked some 600 protesters who were airing their complaints over low pay and poor working conditions along Stung Meanchey road. Police fired live bullets and tear gas to rescue fellow officers. Protesters threw rocks at police. When protesters retreated into a pagoda police fired tear gas into the building. Buddhist monks joined in the protests also throwing rocks at police. More than a dozen people including several monks were arrested.
On 27 December striking garment workers and police officers clashed on a road on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The opposition party organised large protests in Phnom Penh during December, including motorbike rallies. The government called the protests illegal and stated that they were 'inciting anarchy'.
On 3 January at least four people were shot to death and 20 others were injured when police opened fire to break up a protest by garment workers. The workers were demanding their minimum wage be doubled. They had blocked the road with burning tires. Protesters also threw objects at police. By this time most of the workers at Cambodia's 500 factories were on strike. The demand was still for a $160 a month in minimum wage while the government had offered $100. This was the second day of strikes and clashes with police. The opposition party and anti-government protesters have close ties with the labor movement. Unions representing disgruntled garment workers joined the protest with opposition supporters against the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen. They want a re-run of the July election. Sam Rainsy, CNRP leader promised to nearly double wage to $160 if CNRP wins a re-election.
On 4 January a camp occupied by anti-government demonstrators was taken down by Cambodian officials. The camp was in Freedom Park. Hundreds of CNRP supporters started occupying the space on 15 December. It is the only place in Phnom Penh that allowed protests. Protesters fled with their belongings as they saw police approaching. Police did not enter the park, but allowed security guards and city workers to take down the stage and clear the grounds. In spite of the clearing of the park a rally planned for Sunday would go ahead according to Rainsy. At that rally at least eight people injured. On 6 January a protest was led by radio station owner Mam Sonando. They gathered in front of the Cambodia Ministry of Information to demand a license for a television channel. The government rejected the application saying that there was no frequency available. All local TV channels are closely linked to Prime Minister Hun Sen.

Seymour Benzer

Seymour Benzer (October 15, 1921 – November 30, 2007) was an American physicist, biologist and geneticist. 
His career began during the molecular biology revolution of the 1950s, and he eventually rose to prominence in the fields of molecular and behavioral genetics. He led a genetics research lab at Purdue University and at the California Institute of Technology.
Benzer made fundamental discoveries in two quite different fields of genetics. He got his PhD in solid-state physics, but soon switched to genetics after he read Erwin Schrödinger's book "What is Life?"
At Purdue University, Benzer developed the "T4 rII system", a new genetic technique. This used recombination in T4 bacteriophage rII mutants to map the inside structure of genes. Benzer realized that by generating many r mutants and recording the recombination frequency between different r strains, he could make a detailed map of the gene, much as Alfred Sturtevant had done for chromosomes. 
Taking advantage of the enormous number of recombinants that could be analyzed in the rII mutant system, Benzer was eventually able to map over 2400 rII mutations. The data he collected provided the first evidence that the gene is not an indivisible entity, as previously believed, and that genes were linear. Based on his rII data, Benzer also proposed distinct classes of mutations including deletions, point mutations, missense mutations, and nonsense mutations.
Benzer was one of the first scientists in the field of behavioral genetics. As the field began to emerge in the 1960s and 70s, Benzer found himself in scientific opposition to another of the field's leading researchers, Jerry Hirsch. 
Hirsch believed that behaviors were so complex they could not be explained as the action of single genes, Benzer thought behaviors might be directed by single genes. Both researchers tried their ideas out on "Drosophila". Hirsch artificially selected for behaviors of interest over many generations, while Benzer used methods to isolate mutants for a particular behavior. Benzer and Hirsch's competing philosophies developed behavioral genetics, and helped it become a legitimate area of study in the scientific community.
He was a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences.

Prima scriptura

In Christianity, prima scriptura is the idea that canonical scripture is the most important kind of divine revelation. People who believe in this idea say that revelation that comes from scripture is more important than revelation that comes from other sources. Other sources include traditions, spiritual gifts, conscience, common sense and the views of experts. Prima scriptura suggests that there are ways of knowing or understanding God and his will that do not originate from canonized scripture. These may be helpful in interpreting that scripture, but that if they seem to contradict the scriptures, the scriptures should be used instead.
Prima scriptura is sometimes mentioned together with Sola scriptura. Sola scriptura is a view mainly held by protestants which states that only scripture is the source of divine revelation. Sola scriptura rejects scripture which is not in the Bible, while prima scriptura says that there may be such scripture.

Ethnic conflict

An ethnic conflict (or ethnic war) is a conflict where different ethnic groups fight each other. It is different from a civil war, where a single nation or ethnic group is fighting among itself.
Examples of ethnic wars since the 1990s were typically caused by secessionist movements leading to the breakup of multi-ethnic states along ethnic lines: the Yugoslav Wars, the First Chechen War, the Nagorno-Karabakh War, the Rwandan Civil War and the War in Darfur, among others
Academic explanations of ethnic conflict generally fall into one of three schools of thought: primordialist, instrumentalist or constructivist. Intellectual debate has also focused around the issue of whether ethnic conflict has become more common since the end of the Cold War, and on finding ways of managing conflicts, through instruments such as consociationalism and federalisation.

Nuclear family

A nuclear family is a type of family unit. It is made up of a husband, a wife, and their children. Not everyone agrees on what a nuclear family is. Some people say that a nuclear family does not include stepchildren or adopted children. Others say that a nuclear family may include stepchildren or adopted children. A nuclear family is a part of an extended family.
The term "nuclear family" was first used in 1947. However, people have lived in nuclear families for thousands of years. In 2005, archaeologists discovered four 4,600-year-old graves in Germany. Several adults and children who were related were buried in these graves. Researchers think that this proves that people lived in nuclear families a long time ago.
During and before the medieval period in Europe, large family groups, such as clans, were most common. By the late medieval period, the nuclear family had become most common.

George C. Williams

George Christopher Williams (May 12, 1926 – September 8, 2010) was an American evolutionary biologist.
Williams was a professor emeritus of biology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. He was best known for his critique of group selection, though later in life he recognized that it did sometimes occur. The work of Williams in this area, with W.D. Hamilton, John Maynard Smith and others, led to the development of a gene-centered view of evolution.
In 1999 Williams shared the Crafoord Prize, with Maynard Smith and Ernst Mayr, for developing the concept of evolutionary biology.
Williams' 1957 paper "Pleiotropy, natural selection, and the evolution of senescence" was influential in 20th century evolutionary biology. It contains three important ideas. In this paper Williams proposed that senescence should be generally synchronized by natural selection.
"if the adverse genic effects appeared earlier in one system than any other, they would be removed by selection from that system more readily than from any other. In other words, natural selection will always be in greatest opposition to the decline of the most senescence-prone system." 
This paper also contains the first outline of the idea that natural selection might select for menopause and post-reproductive life in females, although Williams does not explicitly mention grandchildren or the inclusive fitness contribution of grandparenting. By helping grandchildren survive, grandparents promote the survival of an average of one-quarter (1/4) of their own genome.
In his first book, "Adaptation and Natural Selection", Williams advocated a "ground rule or perhaps "doctrine" would be a better term ... that adaptation is a special and onerous concept that should only be used where it is really necessary", and, that, when it is necessary, selection among genes or individuals would in general be the preferable explanation for it. This contributed to the development of a gene-centered view of evolution; Richard Dawkins built on Williams' ideas in this area in the book "The Selfish Gene".
Williams was also well known for his work on the evolution of sex, and was an advocate of evolutionary medicine.

Battle of Lewes

The Battle of Lewes was an important battle in the history of England. It was fought near the town of Lewes, in Sussex, England. The battle took place on 14 May 1264. It was one of two main battles of the conflict known as the Second Barons' War.
The two armies that met in the battle were led by King Henry III of England and a rebel leader, Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. Henry III's son, Prince Edward, fought on his side. The battle came about because many of the leading noblemen of England were unhappy with the way King Henry was ruling the country. They wanted more involvement in the government. The Barons voted to hold a Parliament regularly so that they could discuss subjects such as taxation. King Henry would not agree to this, and so both sides started to raise armies. When the two sides met at Lewes two days before, Simon de Montfort tried to arrange a truce with the king. King Henry refused and so both sides got ready to fight a battle. 
The king's army was nearly twice as big as the rebel army. The battle began when the Baronial forces attacked the king's . When the fighting started, it looked as though the king's army would win easily. Prince Edward, who was only 25, was headstrong and made one big mistake. Edward was in charge of the cavalry, who did well in the battle but then chased some of the rebels who were running away. By the time they came back to the battlefield, the rebels had managed to win the battle. With Edward off chasing foot soldiers, Henry was forced to attack using his two remaining divisions. Henry led one, the other was led by his brother, Richard, Earl of Cornwall. Henry's division fought until driven back by the Baronial reserve forces. Cornwall's division did not do well from the start. Cornwall fled the field and hid in a windmill but was quickly captured by the barons. As a result of the battle, King Henry III was forced to sign a document called the Mise of Lewes. This gave the rebel barons what they wanted. A year later the barons were defeated at the Battle of Evesham.

Persecution of Muslims is the religious persecution of Muslims (persecution based on their religion). This can mean any form of participating in discrimination against Muslims. This includes using violence against them or putting them in prison. Muslims were persecuted during the crusades. There was also persecution during the Mongol invasion and in the Iberian Peninsula when they were subject to the Inquisitions. Modern persecution of Muslims exists in many countries such as Myanmar, Central African Republic and Serbia. 
Islam is a major religion and like other major religions they have suffered violent persecution.

Photodiode

A photodiode is a light sensitive semiconductor. It is a type of photodetector capable of changing (or converting) light into either current or voltage, depending upon the mode of operation. If the anode and cathode leads of a photodiode are joined together by a wire, when in the dark, no current will flow. On the other hand, when in the light, current flows from the cathode to the anode. The diode part of a photodiode allows current to flow in only one direction.
Photodiodes may contain optical filters, built-in lenses, and may have large or small surface areas. Photodiodes usually have a slower as its surface area increases. The common, traditional solar cell used to generate electric solar power is a large area photodiode. Photodiodes and look the same physically but have different functions.

Bedrock

In stratigraphy, bedrock is the common term for solid rock under the surface of the Earth. Above the bedrock is usually an area of broken and weathered rock, soil, sand, pebbles, etc. 
The top of the bedrock is known as the rockhead and identifying this, via excavations, drilling or geophysical methods, is an important task in most civil engineering projects. Loose material on top (known as drift) can be extremely thick, so that the bedrock lies hundreds of meters below the surface.
A 'solid' geologic map of an area will usually show the rock that would be exposed at the surface if all soil or other superficial deposits were removed.

Police car

A police car is a motor vehicle used by police. It is used to assist with their duties in patrolling and responding to incidents. Typical uses of a police car include transportation for officers to reach the scene of an incident quickly. Police cars are also used to transport suspects, or to an area. Police cars usually marked to identify them. This is a high visibility to crime. Some police cars are adapted for certain functions such as traffic control, to transport police dogs or bomb disposal.
In the United Kingdom in the early 1900s, police vehicles were first used to chase speeding motorists. This had very poor results until police schools were opened to teach officers how to use their vehicles properly. In 1910 the first police car in the US was used in Akron, Ohio. By 1920 police cars were in wide use in the US. It was noticed that patrol cars allowed police to respond faster. It also allowed an officer to cover a wider area. By the 1960s most major cities had shifted away from foot patrols altogether in favor of police cars. But studies proved a mix of foot officers and police vehicles worked best.
Police cars are often identified with high speed of fleeing . The offense may have been anything from a to a major felony. Suspects often attempt to lose law enforcement by driving away, sometimes at high speed. From 1990 to 2005, 136 people were killed in the US in high speed pursuits by police. Despite controversy as to whether high speed chases are necessary police continue to work on the problem using technology and new techniques. One technique is the 'take out'. A take out is a technique used to cause the fleeing vehicle to lose control and be turned sideways by the police vehicle. 
Terms for police cars include (police) cruiser, squad car, area car and patrol car. In some places, a police car may also be informally known as a cop car, a 'Black and white', a 'Cherry top', a 'gumball machine', a 'jam sandwich' or 'panda car'. Depending on the configuration of the emergency lights and livery, a police car may be considered a marked or unmarked unit.

Linear function

In basic mathematics, a linear function is a function whose graph is a straight line in 2-dimensions (see images). An example is: "y"=2"x"–1. In higher mathematics, a linear function often refers to a linear mapping.
Formally, a linear function is a function "f"("x"):R→R such that the graph of "f" is a line. This means the domain or input of "f" is a real number R and the range or output of "f" is also a real number R. Usually we write "y"("x") or just "y" in place of "f"("x"). So the formal statement means:
There are three main forms for writing linear functions: slope-intercept, standard and parametric.
The slope-intercept (also called point-slope or explicit) form of a linear function is  formula_1  or  formula_2 . This form has 2 variables "x" and "у" and 2 constants "m" and "b". 
Example: "y"=–2"x"+4. The slope is "m"= –2 and the "y"-intercept is "b"=4 or the point (0,4). Substituting "y"=0 and solving for "x", we get 0=–2"x"+4 or "x"=2. So "x"=2 is the root of this linear function and the point (2,0) is the "x"-intercept. Since the slope is "m" = –2, the line is decreasing. Since |–2|=2>1, the decrease is "relatively" steep. For each change in "х" of 1 (to the right), the value of "у" changes -2 (goes down). 
Example: "y"=–2"x"+4. Substituting "x"=0 we get "y"=4 (this is the "y"-intercept) and thus the point (0,4). Substituting "x"=1, we get "y"=2 and thus the point (1,2). Plot these points and draw the line. (Notice that the 2nd point is 1 to the right and 2 down from the 1st point. As we said in the above example, this happens because the slope is "m"= –2) 
Example: "y"= –"x"+2. Suppose "y"= –1. We substitute "y"= –1 and get: –1= –'x"+2 or "x"=3. This is the only solution. We can do this for any "y"-value.
   formula_3.
Example: The linear function 3"x"–2"y"=1 is in standard form. The constants are "A"=3, "B"=–2 and "C"=1. 
Example: The lines 3"x"–2"y"=1 and 6"x"–4"y"=2 are coincident (same line). Here the factor is: "k"=2. We multiplied the first equation by 2 to get the second equation. The unique slope-intercept form of this line is: "y"=1.5"x"–0.5 (solve either equation for y).
Parametric form: formula_5    or
Vector form: formula_6  or  formula_7 .
Example: X=(–1,1)+"t"(2,3), t∈R is a line in vector form. Here: "a"=2, "a"=3, "x"=–1 and "x"=1. The line goes through the points ("x","y")=(–1,1) and ("x"+"a","y"+"a")=(1,4). The corresponding parametric form of this line is: "x"("t")= –1+2"t", "y"("t")=1+3"t". The unique slope-intercept form of this line is: "y"("x")=1.5"x"+2.5   (solve the first equation for "t" and substitute this result into the second equation).
Example: X=(–1,1,2)+"t"(2,3,–1), t∈R is a line in 3-dimensional space. The line goes through the points (–1,1,2) and (1,4,1).
In the context where it is defined, the derivative of a function is a measure of the rate of change of function values with respect to change in input values. A linear function has a constant rate of change. This rate of change is the slope "m". So "m" is the derivative. This is often written:
Example: "y"= –2"x"+4. Here "m"= –2 and so "y"′= –2.
Often, the terms "linear equation" and "linear function" are confused. Both are polynomials. However, the word "linear" in "linear equation" means that all terms with variables are first degree. (The word "linear" in "linear function" means the graph is a line.) A linear equation can have 1, 2, 3, or more variables. So a linear equation is a linear function only if it has exactly 2 variables. (A linear equation in one variable is a point on the number line and a linear equation in 3 variables is a plane in 3-dimensional space.)
Many countries and disciplines use different letters and ordering for the different forms. 
In many countries, a linear functions is often written as formula_9 where "a" is the slope and "b" is the "y"-intercept.
In business and economics, a linear function is often written as formula_10 where "a" is the "y"-intercept and "b" is the slope.

YM (magazine)

YM (or Your Magazine) was an American magazine for teenaged girls. It originally began being published in the 1930s. It was published for 72 years. It was the second-oldest girls' magazine in the United States; the oldest being "Seventeen".
It began as two separate magazines: "Compact" and "Calling All Girls". "Compact" was aimed at older teenagers. It was first published in 1932. "Calling All Girls" was intended for younger girls. It began publication in July 1941 after a teen column in "Parents' Magazine" produced a positive interest from readers. It was the first magazine for girls. Contents consisted of comics, fashion advice, and short stories. It was originally published four times a year, but soon became published every month. This was because it was popular. By 1945 it was selling 500,000 copies of each issue. The average reader was aged 13. The magazine never appealed to older teens or fashion advertisers because of its emphasis on comics.
During the 1960s, the two titles ("Compact" and "Calling All Girls") merged into "Young Miss". The title changed again to "Young & Modern" in the 1980s. It was changed one final time in 2000 to "YM". This was said to stand for "Your Magazine".
"YM" stopped being published in 2004. Subscriptions were replaced with "Teen Vogue".

Bantustan

A Bantustan (also known as a Bantu homeland, black homeland, black state, or simply homeland) was a territory set aside for South Africa's black inhabitants during apartheid. Ten Bantustans were established in South Africa and ten more in South-West Africa (now Namibia), with the goal of creating nation states for the black tribes of Africa. The term "Bantustan" comes from "Bantu" (meaning "people" in the Bantu languages) and "-stan" (meaning "land" in Persian).
The founders of apartheid tried hard to make the Bantustans recognised internationally, but this never happened, and most blacks did not like the Bantustans. They were unpopular because:
The Bantustans were dissolved in 1994 and their territory incorporated into the Republic of South Africa. From 1994, most parts of the country were redivided into new provinces.
Lesotho and Swaziland were not Bantustans, but former British colonies granted independence by Great Britain and internationally recognised.
Four of the South African Bantustans, Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, and Ciskei (also called the "TBVC States") were granted independence from South Africa, but were never internationally recognised. The other six had a high amount of autonomy.
Beginning in 1968, ten Bantustans were established in South-West Africa. Unlike the Bantustans in South Africa, only four Bantustans in South-West Africa were granted autonomy, and none were granted independence. The Bantustans were abolished in May 1989 in the transition to independence.

Coloured

In South African, Namibian, Zambian, Botswanan, and Zimbabwean context, the term Coloured (Kleurlinge in Afrikaans) is used to refer to people of mixed European and Khoisan or Bantu ancestry.
They form the majority of the Northern Cape and Western Cape populations. Most Coloured speak Afrikaans as their first language, although there are some native English speakers. The majority of Coloureds living in Cape Town are able to speak both languages.
Because of South Africa's history of racial discrimination, many feel that the term "coloured" is derogatory. The official term is "Coloured people", but many Coloureds prefer to call themselves "Black", "Khoisan", or just "South African".
During apartheid, people were classified into four groups: White, Black, Coloured, and Asian. The Cape Malays, who are of Asian descent, were not classified as Asians, but as Coloureds.
Although they were discriminated upon by the government, many Coloureds and Asians got to enjoy certain rights during the apartheid era. For example, they did not have to carry around a passbook, had limited political representation, and were considered citizens of South Africa.

<doc id="436729" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=436729" title="Jan Smuts">
Jan Smuts

Jan Christiaan Smuts, OM, CH, ED, KC, FRS, PC (24 May 1870 – 11 September 1950), was a South African soldier and Prime Minister, from 1919 to 1924 and again from 1939 to 1948.
Jan Smuts was born into a wealthy Afrikaner family living in the British Cape Colony. He first went to school at age 12, going to Victoria College four years later to study science and the arts. He later went to Christ's College in Cambridge to study law.
Smuts was a supporter of Cecil Rhodes until it was revealed that he was apart of the Jameson Raid by a group of Uitlanders ("foreigners" in Afrikaans) in the Transvaal Republic. In 1898, Smuts moved to Johannesburg in the Transvaal to practice law and later became a minister in the Transvaal government until the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War.
During the Boer War, he lead a Boer Commando in the Cape Colony using guerrilla tactics. After the war, Smuts joined the cabinet lead by Louis Botha in 1907. However, uneasiness with his Afrikaner comrades cooperating with the British lead him to disown the Afrikaners on year later, declaring himself to be South African instead.
Two years after the Union of South Africa was formed, Smuts created the Union Defence Force (UDF). He lead the UDF and was instrumental in the conquest of German South-West Africa and German East Africa during World War I. In 1917, Smuts was invited to join the Imperial War Cabinet. In 1918, Smuts helped created the Royal Air Force.
Smuts and Botha were key negotiators at the Paris Peace Conference. After signing the Treaty of Versailles, which gave South Africa control over Namibia, Smuts returned to politics.
When Botha died in 1919, Smuts became Prime Minister, serving until his defeat in 1924 to the National Party.
After serving nine years in opposition, Smuts became Deputy Prime Minister in a coalition government lead by Barry Hertzog.
When Hertzog asked for neutrality towards Nazi Germany during World War II, he was deposed and Smuts became Prime Minister again. During World War II, Smuts was invited to the Imperial War Cabinet again, where he worked closely with Winston Churchill. In 28 May 1941, Smuts became a Field Marshal of the British Army, becoming the first South African to hold that rank. This cooperation with Churchill made Smuts very unpopular with the Afrikaners, which lead to his downfall.
In May 1945, Smuts represented South Africa during the drafting of the Charter of the United Nations. Just as he did in 1919, Smuts urged the delegates to create a powerful international organisation to preserve peace. Smuts signed the Paris Peace Treaty, becoming the only person to sign the treaties that ended both the First and Second World Wars.
After World War II, Smuts continued to represent South Africa internationally. However, his support for the war and plans to change racial segregation in South Africa made him very unpopular with the Afrikaners, and in 1948, lost the election to Daniel Francois Malan and the pro-Apartheid National Party.
Smuts died on 11 September 1950 from a heart attack on his family farm.

The term mass murder refers to when a murder of four people or more happens. Usually the murders happen at the same time or over a relatively short period of time. The FBI defines mass murder as the killing of many people without any cooling off period. By comparison a serial killer has a cooling off period between murders. Murder can be done by a person, a terrorist group, a government or police. In many cases, the killer has a mental disorder. In many cases, the killer commits suicide or is killed by police.
The University of Texas massacre in August 1966, the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, the Virginia Tech massacre, the 2012 Aurora shooting and the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting are some examples of mass murders that have happened in the United States.
The United Kingdom's mass murders include those in Hungerford, Berkshire in 1987 and in Dunblane, Scotland in 1996. Australia's mass murders include the Port Arthur massacre in 1996.

There is no net in between players. There is also no firm rules about where it is played. It can be played on tennis courts, streets, beaches, fields or gyms. The court is two squares of 5.50–metre (18 ft) length. They are fixed opposite to each other at a distance of 12.8 m (42 ft).
There are tournaments all over the world. Tournaments are organized into a growing number of clubs. In some countries, associations are already established, for example the German Speed Badminton Association (DSBV) and the Swiss Speed Badminton (SSB). On August 25, 2011 the international Speed Badminton Organization (ISBO) was founded in Berlin.

Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia

The Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia (RFDS) is a medical service in Australia. It was the first flying medical service in the world. It provides emergency and other health care to people living in rural and remote areas. It is a not-for-profit organisation.
Communities in the Outback and the bush are generally small, and spread over large distances. Many farms, stations and outstations are located far from towns over rough trails. Because of this, many of these places do not have access to hospitals or doctors. The Flying Doctor Service brings medical service to them. It can land planes in any community that has an airstrip.
Today it has a fleet of about 60 planes. They fly from 21 bases located across Australia.
The service was started by Reverend John Flynn. He had worked in rural areas of Victoria. In 1912, he was asked by the Presbyterian Church to look at the needs of people living in the Northern Territory. His report about it led to the creation of the Australian Inland Mission (AIM). Flynn became the manager of this. It began as one nursing clinic. By 1926, it had become a network of ten nursing clinics.
On 15 May 1928, Flynn formed the AIM Aerial Medical Service. This was an experiment based in Cloncurry, in Queensland. AIM leased a de Havilland DH.50 plane from the Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Service (Qantas). The plane was named "Victory". It would fly doctors to remote communities. The service answered its first call on 17 May 1928. From Cloncurry, the plane flew to Julia Creek in central Queensland. Within its first year of operations, the service flew more than 30,000 kilometres in 50 flights. It became the world's first flying ambulance service.
From the mid-1920s, Flynn had been experimenting with radio together with Alfred Traeger. Traeger built the first pedal-powered transmitter in 1929. It allowed people in remote places to contact a central medical base. These transmitters were given out gradually to stations, missions and other communities around Cloncurry. Cloncurry was the base site for a large transmitter.
During its first few decades, the service got most of its money from community fundraising, volunteers and donations. Today, the service gets financial help from the federal and state governments. But it still needs money from fundraising and donations from the community.
Until the 1960s, the service mostly leased planes and pilots. After this point, the service moved on to buying its own equipment and employing its own pilots and mechanics.
By the early 1930s, there was growing interest in expanding the service across the continent. Demand for its services was increasing. In response, the service expanded its fleet by hiring more planes and more pilots. Money from fundraising and the Australian Government helped to finance the project. In 1934, it became the Australian Aerial Medical Service. It opened up new bases across the country, in Wyndham, Port Hedland, Kalgoorlie, Broken Hill, Alice Springs, Meekatharra, Charters Towers and Charleville. These bases were organised into "sections". A council to manage the organisation was formed in 1936.
The service's name was changed to the Flying Doctor Service in 1942. It was given the honorific "Royal" in 1955.

John Ostrom

John Harold Ostrom (February 18, 1928 – July 16, 2005) was an American paleontologist. 
In the 1960s, he showed that dinosaurs are more like big non-flying birds than they are like lizards (or "saurians"). Thomas Henry Huxley in the 1860s had thought birds evolved from dinosaurs, based on a comparison of "Archaeopteryx" with "Compsognathus". Huxley's idea was later discarded, mainly because Heilmann, in 1926, had different views. 
The first of Ostrom's reviews of the osteology and phylogeny of the primitive bird "Archaeopteryx" appeared in 1976. After the modern discoveries of fossil dinobirds in China, the HuxleyOstrom theory was accepted by almost all palaeontologists.
Ostrom was a professor at Yale University. He was the Curator Emeritus of vertebrate paleontology at the Peabody Museum of Natural History, which has an impressive fossil collection started by Othniel Charles Marsh. He died from complications of Alzheimer's disease.
His 1964 discovery of "Deinonychus" was one of the most important fossil finds in history. "Deinonychus" was an active predator that clearly killed its prey by leaping and slashing or stabbing with its "terrible claw". Evidence of a truly active lifestyle included long strings of tendons running along the tail, making it a stiff counterbalance for jumping and running. The conclusion that at least some dinosaurs had a high metabolism, and were therefore warm-blooded, was popularized by his student Robert Bakker. This helped to change the impression of dinosaurs as the sluggish, slow, cold-blooded lizards which had prevailed since the turn of the century.
This changed how dinosaurs are seen by both professional dinosaur illustrators, and by the public. The find is also credited with triggering the "dinosaur renaissance", a term coined in a 1975 issue of "Scientific American" by Bakker. It describes the renewed interest in paleontology, which has lasted from the 1970s to the present. 
Ostrom's interest in the dinosaur-bird connection started with his study of what is now known as the Haarlem "Archaeopteryx". Discovered in 1855, it was actually the first specimen recovered but, incorrectly labeled as "Pterodactylus crassipes", it languished in the Teyler's Museum in the Netherlands until Ostrom's 1970 paper (and 1972 description) correctly identified it as one of only eight "first birds" (counting the solitary feather).
Ostrom also studied fossilized trackways of the duckbilled dinosaur "Hadrosaurus". He decided they traveled in herds. To this extent they were social animals like many birds and mammals, but unlike lizards.

Maya Plisetskaya

Maya Mikhaylovna Plisetskaya (; 20 November 1925 – 2 May 2015) was a Russian ballerina, choreographer, director and actress. She was born in Moscow, Soviet Union. 
Plisetskaya gained an interest in ballet at a young age and was active during the Soviet period. She has been called by some, such as Nikita Khrushchev, one of the best ballerinas of all time. She was married to composer and pianist Rodion Shchedrin from 1958 until her death.
Plisetskaya was born in Moscow, Russia to Lithuanian Jewish parents. Her mother, Rachel Messerer, was a silent movie actress and her father, Mikhail Plisetski, was a diplomat. She studied at the Bolshoi Theater.
In 1938, her father was arrested and later executed during the Stalinist purges. Her mother was arrested soon after and, with Maya's seven-month-old baby brother, sent to a gulag in Kazakhstan for the next three years. Plisetskaya was taken in by her maternal aunt (a ballerina) until her mother was released in 1941. 
During the years without her parents, and barely a teenager, Plisetskaya "faced terror, war, and dislocation". As a result, "Maya took refuge in ballet and the Bolshoi Theatre".
For many years she was not allowed to tour outside the Soviet Union. This ban was lifted in 1959 by Nikita Khrushchev. 
Able to travel the world as a member of the Bolshoi, her skill as a dancer was widely recognised. It set a high standard for ballerinas in technique and dramatic presence. Khrushchev allowed her to go on the Bolshoi tour in New York and he was immensely satisfied upon reading the reviews of her performances. He embraced her on her return.
Within a few years, she was recognized as “an international superstar” and a continuous “box office hit throughout the world”. The Soviet Union treated her as a favored cultural emissary, as “the dancer who did not defect”. Although she toured extensively during the years that other dancers defected, including Rudolph Nureyev, Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov, Plisetskaya always returned to Russia.
Plisetskaya explains that for her generation, and her family in particular, defecting was a moral issue. She had once asked her mother why their family didn't leave the Soviet Union when they had the chance, at the time living in Norway. Her mother said “Misha would never have been a traitor”.
Plisetskaya married composer Rodion Shchedrin in 1958. They lived in Munich, Germany. She was close friends with Robert F. Kennedy. Plisetskaya was a naturalized citizen of Lithuania and Spain.
Plisetskaya died in Munich, Germany on 2 May 2015 from a heart attack, aged 89.
Plisetskaya was given many awards by the Soviet Union, and by Russia. Of special note were:

Zhucheng fossil site

The Zhucheng fossil site is in Zhucheng, a city in the Shandong Province of China. It is perhaps the greatest treasury of dinosaur fossils found in the 20th century.
Zhucheng has been an important site for dinosaur excavation since 1960. The local community used the calcium-rich fossils for traditional village remedies used to treat muscle cramps and other minor ailments. 
The world's largest hadrosaur fossil was found in Zhucheng in the 1980s, and is on display in the local museum. Scientists have collected more than of fossils since 1960. 
Many dinosaur bones were smuggled out of the city. In 2008 Australia returned hundreds of kilograms of Chinese dinosaur fossils, including dinosaur fossil eggs. These fossils were recovered during a sting operation carried out on warehouses and cargo containers.
The palaeontologists believe they have found one of the biggest sites of dinosaur remains from a massive excavation pit. The fossilized bones date to the Upper Cretaceous just before to the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The findings also include the remains of a 20 meter (66 ft) hadrosaurid, a record size for the duck-billed dinosaur. A fossilized skull of a large ceratopsian was also found along with bones which belong to club-tailed ankylosaurs.
Such a high concentration of fossil bones in such a small area suggests they died together and suddenly. Scientists believe a volcanic eruption may have killed the dinosaurs, and a subsequent flood carried the fossils to Zhucheng, which may have been a wetland covered in grass.
The local authorities in Shandong are making plans to set up a fossil park in the area.

Royal Highness

Royal Highness is a style of address traditionally used to address or refer to members of the royal families. This address is usually for princes, other than monarchs, and their female . This style ranks below that of Imperial Highness. Historically the term was first used by Gaston, Duke of Orléans, younger son of King Henry IV of France. He encountered this style in Brussels and used it himself. His children later used the style, considering it their right as grandchildren of France. In contradiction to other European kingdoms, the kingdom of Denmark reserves the superior style of Royal Highness only to the children of the monarch and the children of the crown prince; other grandchildren of a Danish monarch enjoy the style of Highness, e.g. Princess Elisabeth of Denmark.

<doc id="437217" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=437217" title="Metre Convention">
Metre Convention

The Metre Convention is the treaty that set up the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). The BIPM is an inter-governmental organization that is responsible for harmonizing systems of measurement across the world. The treaty was first made in 1875 between 17 countries. 
The member countries agreed to share the costs of running a laboratory on neutral territory. The international prototype metre and the international prototype kilogram would be kept at the laboratory. Member state's national prototype metres and kilograms would be compared with the international prototypes at regular intervals. Member states would have regular meetings to discuss developments in measurement technology.
In 1921 the treaty was extended to cover electrical and all other physical measurements. This enabled the BIPM to published the standards for the International System of Units (SI). Under SI, units of measurements that are used in science and engineering were defined in a logical manner. The rules for SI also standardized the way in which physical quantities are written.
In 2014 the BIPM had 55 member countries.
The metric system was developed in France in the 1790s. The length of the metre was made to be one ten millionth of the distance between the North Pole and the equator. Between 1791 and 1798 the French men Delambre (a mathematician and astronomer) and Méchain (an astronomer) measured the distance between Dunkirk and Barcelona. The measurements were used to make a metal bar exactly 443.296 "lignes" long (the "ligne" is an old French unit of length equal to one twelfth of a French inch). The bar would be used as a standard for the metre. The bar was later called the "metre des archives". By the 1860s it was found that the "metre des archives" was 0.03% shorter than it was supposed to have been.
The Great Exhibition in London in 1851 and the Paris International Exhibition in 1867 had shown the need for different nations to use the same units of measurement. In the 1860s there were many discussions by astronomers and surveyors from outside France whether they should use the "metre des archives" or whether they should use a "new metre" that took account of the 0.03% error. Prussia took the lead in organizing conferences in Berlin to discuss the matter. France did not take part in the conferences. Before any actions could be taken the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Prussia defeated France. At the same time the German Empire was formed.
In 1875 France invited representatives to Paris to discuss the matter. This helped France to score a diplomatic victory over Prussia and the German Empire.
The treaty was signed by seventeen of the countries at the conference in Paris on 20 May 1875. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands went to the conference but did not sign the treaty at that time. After further consideration, the United Kingdom did sign the treaty in 1884.
The meeting agreed:
The organization set up by the treaty was the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. Its French name is "Bureau international des poids et mesures". Its abbreviation is BIPM. The BIPM has its headquarters at the Pavillon de Breteuil, Sèvres, France (close to Paris). About 70 people work at the BIPM. The budget for 2013 was over €10 million ($12 million).
The three organisations were set up under the treaty. They are:
The Bureau has responsibility for safeguarding the international prototype kilogram.
The official language for the organisations is French. Until 1988 all reports of meetings were only published in French. Since then both English and French have been used. Abbreviations are based on the French words, not English words. Official communications between the BIPM and France are conducted via the French Foreign Ministry. Official communications with other countries are conducted via that country's embassy in Paris.
The General Conference on Weights and Measures was set up under the Metre Convention as an organ of the BIPM. It gives the BIPM its mandate and budget on behalf of the member states. Its French name is "Conférence générale des poids et mesures". Its abbreviation is "CGPM".
The CGPM meets every four to six years. The first meeting was in 1889 and the 24th meeting was in 2011. Each member state has one vote. France is represented by its foreign minister and by the president of the French Academy. The French Foreign minister is the chairman of the opening and closing sessions of any CGPM session. The president of the French Academy is the chairman of other meetings of the CGPM. 
The CGPM:
The International Committee for Weights and Measures was set up under the Metre Convention as an organ of the BIPM. It advises the CGPM and supervise the BIPM. Its French name is "Comité international des poids et mesures". Its abbreviation is CIPM.
The CGPM has 18 members. These members are well-known measurement experts who are elected by the CGPM. They must all come from different countries. One of the CIPM members must be French. They meet once or twice a year in Paris. The CIPM is assisted by a number of Consultative Committees. In February 2014 there were ten such committees. Nine of the committees are dedicated to special types of measurement such as Electricity and Magnetism, Length, Photometry and Radiometry, Thermometry and Time and Frequency. The CIPM appoints people to these committees.
The tenth committee is called the Consultative Committee for Units (CCU). Its chairman is appointed by the CIPM. Other members of the committee are appointed by other organizations. These organizations include International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CCU's task is to ensure that all the definitions of SI are consistent. It also drafts the SI standard which is called the "SI Brochure".
The BIPM's offices and laboratories art at the Pavillon de Breteuil, Sèvres, France (close to Paris). 
The BIPM looks after the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK) for the CGPM. It provides laboratory services for the CGPM and CIPM. Member states use the BIPM laboratories when they check their own copy of the kilogram against the IPK. The BIPM offices are also the headquarters for the CGPM and CIPM.
In 1875 the convention only dealt with standardization of the kilogram and the metre. The convention was revised in 1921 to accommodate all physical measurements. In 1933 the CGPM approved efforts that were being made to merge electrical and photometry units into the metric system.
During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century many new units of measure were defined using the metric system. Units of measure used in electrostatic applications, electromagnetic applications and electrical distribution systems were incompatible with each other. The use of standard gravity in force and pressure definitions resulted in more units of measure being defined than were necessary. 
After the Second World War the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) and the French Government asked the BIPM to look into the matter. In 1948, the 9th CGPM asked the CIPM to conduct a study into units of measurement used by member states. The CIPM reported back and in 1954 the 10th CGPM decided to set up a new system of units. There would be six base units. These were the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, degree Kelvin (later renamed kelvin), and candela. The new system was published in 1960. The 11th CGPM named it the "International System of Units". The short name was "SI". This came from the French name, . The BIPM described SI as "the modern metric system".
Since 1960 the BIPM has made several refinements to SI. Some of the refinements include developing new ways of making high precision measurement. Other refinements include small changes to details of definitions.
The atomic clock has made very precise time-keeping possible. The earth is slowing down. A the "time of the dinosaurs" the earth rotated once every 23 hours. It is now possible to measure variations in the Earth's rotation caused by volcanoes and tsunamis. This is done by the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS). The IERS proposes leap seconds as and when these are needed. Under the Metre Convention, the BIPM has the task of coordinating over 200 atomic clocks around the world. These clocks are located in 50 different national laboratories.
Many measuring devices need to be recalibrated at regular intervals. These devices might be petrol pumps. They might be weighing scales. They might be complex medical equipment like MRI scanners. A certificate is issued when the device is recalibrated. The device that is used to do the calibration must itself be calibrated. These devices are often recalibrated in a national metrology laboratory. Legal problems can arise if a calibration done in one country is not recognised in another country.
Some countries are full members of the CGPM and have a vote at CGPM meetings. These countries have their own copy of the prototype kilogram. They also take part in the CIPM MRA program. 
Other countries are associate members. They take part on the CIPM MRA program. They may speak at CGPM meetings but not to vote at these meetings. They do not have their own copies of the prototype kilogram.
 (1877) <br>
At its 21st meeting (October 1999), the CGPM created the category of "associate" for those states not yet members of the BIPM and for economic unions.
The following international organisations have signed the CIPM MRA:

Diego da Silva Costa (born 7 October 1988) is a Brazilian/Spanish footballer. He plays as a striker for Chelsea F.C. in England
He was born in Brazil and played for the Brazil national football team for the first time in 2013. However, he now plays for Spain. This has made the Brazil manager, Luiz Felipe Scolari, very angry. The Brazilian Football Confederation have even asked the country's government to remove Costa's citizenship.
In March 2014, Costa changed to the Spanish national team, this was when he was granted his Spanish citizernship. He made his first appearance against Italy and represented Spain in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. 
Costa spent 2 years at Barcelona Esportivo Capela, from 2004 to 2006. After this, he then began his senior career in Portugal.
Diego Costa joined Braga in 2006. But due to a loan at Penafiel, he didn't get a game.
In the same year as joining Braga, he was sent on a loan spell to Penafiel. He achieved 13 league games with 5 goals.
In 2007, Costa joined Atletico Madrid for a fee of €1.5 million. Unfortunately, he didn't get a games due to loan spells.
Diego Costa remained at Braga in 2007 but on a loan spell. This time, he made 7 league appearances, but he failed to score a goal. In the UEFA Cup, he scored his first goal in a domestic cup against Parma F.C.
He was then loaned to Celta for the 2007-08 Segunda Division season. In that season, he made an impressive 30 appearances and scored 5 goals.
Staying in the Segunda Division, he then joined on loan Albacete Balompie for the 2008-09 season. At this loan spell, he made 35 league appearances and 9 goals.
Costa was bought by Valladoid from Atletico Madrid in 2009 Transfer Window. In this 2009-10 season, he made 34 league appearances with 8 goals. But it wasn't enough to keep Valladoid in the La Liga. Near to the end of the season, they were relegated.
Costa returned to Atletico in June 2010 for an undisclosed fee. Since then, Costa has made a superb 94 league appearances and 43 league goals during his 4 year spell with the club. In his time, he suffered with a few injuries during his time. This include his hamstring injury he suffered near to the end of the 2013-14 La Liga season. 
On the 1 July 2014, it was announced that Chelsea had agreed a fee with Atletico to sign Costa for a fee of £32 million. He made his first league appearance against Burnley in a game which he scored in for Chelsea to win 3-1. Costa is currently top goal scorer in the Barclays Premier League and has flown during his start at Chelsea
During his international career, he started with the Brazilian National Team in 2013. He only made 2 appearances with no goals. But controversy was created when Costa was granted a Spanish Citizernship in 2014. Then, Costa adopted Spain as his national side. He made his debut against Italy on the 5 March 2014, Spain won 1-0. Costa was called-up to play for Spain in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He started for both of the first two games of Spain's torlument against Holland and Chile, but was rested against Australia. Spain lost 5-1 against Holland And 2-0 against Chile. They did win 3-0 against Australia in their final group game, but it wasn't enough to keep them to progess into the knock out phases. Costa is still yet to score a goal for Spain during his time playing as a striker for the national side.

Gomphothere

The Gomphotheres were a varied family of extinct elephant-like animals (proboscidea) the Gomphotheriidae. They had a wide distribution. They were common in North America during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs, 121.6 million years ago. Some lived in parts of Eurasia, Beringia and, after the Great American Interchange, South America.
Beginning about 5 million years ago, they were gradually replaced by modern elephants. The last two South American species, in the genus "Cuvieronius", did not become extinct until about 9000 years ago. "Stegomastodon" remains have been dated as recently as 6,000 years ago in the Valle del Magdalena, Colombia. Gomphotheres also survived in Mexico and Central America until the end of the Pleistocene.

<doc id="437295" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=437295" title="Revolver">
Revolver

The term revolver refers to repeating firearms with a revolving cylinder. Revolvers have several chambers. These are handguns although other types of weapons use revolving cylinders. They are also called revolving guns, though "revolver" is used far more often. The first revolvers date back to late 1500s in Europe. It was not until the 1700s or 1800s, however, they became affordable. Revolvers are sometimes used by law enforcement agencies. On some occasions, these guns can be reset by one hand, then loaded with the other.
In a single-action revolver, the hammer is manually cocked. This is usually done with the thumb. This action advances the cylinder to the next cartridge. It also locks the cylinder in place with the chamber aligned with the barrel. The trigger, when pulled, releases the hammer, which fires the round in the chamber. To fire again, the hammer must be manually cocked again. This is called "single-action" because the trigger only performs a single action—that of releasing the hammer. Because only a single action is performed and trigger pull is very light, firing a revolver in this way allows most shooters to achieve greater accuracy. Additionally, the need to cock the hammer manually acts as a safety. The gun will not fire unless the hammer is cocked back. The Colt Paterson Revolver, the Walker Colt, the Colt's Dragoon and the Colt Single Action Army pistol of the American Frontier era are all good examples of this system.
In double-action (DA), the stroke of the trigger pull generates three actions: 
Thus, DA means that a cocking action separate from the trigger pull is not needed. Every trigger pull will result in a complete cycle. This allows the gun to be carried uncocked. It also allows the gun to be drawn from the holster and fired using only the trigger. However, a DA revolver has a longer and harder trigger pull. However, this drawback can also be viewed as a safety feature, as the gun is safer against accidental discharges from being dropped.
Most double-action revolvers may be fired in two ways.

The loudness war is a negative term that describes the apparent competition to release albums that are increasingly loud. Albums that are "victims of the loudness war" have less good sound quality because the dynamic range has been compressed to make the music louder. Examples of albums that are victims of the loudness war include "Death Magnetic" by Metallica. Record producer Charles Dye started an organization called Turn Me Up! that campaigns to give musicians the choice to make albums with bigger dynamic ranges. In March 2010, mastering engineer Ian Shepherd organised the first Dynamic Range Day.

Eritherium is an extinct genus of early Proboscidean. It was discovered in Morocco. It was first named by Emmanuel Gheerbrant in 2009 and the type species is "Eritherium azzouzorum". Eritherium is the oldest, smallest and most primitive known elephant relative.
The phosphate bed where the remains were found places the animal's age as 61.1 to 57.8 million years ago.
"Eritherium" is the oldest known representative of the Proboscideans. It has not been assigned to any family in the order. "Eritherium" is the sister clade to "Phosphatherium", "Numidotherium" and "Moeritherium". This is one of the most complete evolutionary sequences of early mammalian radiations after the K/T extinction event. Thus, the elephants are one of the oldest "modern" mammal orders to have survived.

Cylinder (firearms)

A cylinder, in firearms terminology, is the cylindrical, rotating part of a revolver. The cylinder has multiple cartridges chambers. The cylinder revolves around a central shaft in the revolver. This is to bring each individual chamber into alignment with the barrel for firing. Each time the gun is cocked (made ready to fire), the cylinder rotates by one chamber making the pistol ready to fire again.
Cylinders typically hold six cartridges—which is why revolvers are sometimes called "six shooters". But some small frame revolvers only hold five cartridges, due to the smaller overall size of the gun. Several models of .22 rimfire caliber revolvers have cylinders holding nine or ten rounds. As a general rule, cylinders are not designed to be removed from the firearm except for cleaning. A speedloader or moon clip can be used with some revolvers for rapid reloading.

Apomixis

Apomixis is reproduction where only one parent passes genes to the offspring. Apomictically produced offspring are genetically identical to the parent (clones). 
The method is most seen in plants, especially flowering plants. Brambles (blackberry) are apomictic. Some authorities give "reproduction by special tissues without fertilisation", or "asexual formation of a seed from the maternal tissues of the ovule, avoiding meiosis and fertilization, leading to embryo development".
Apomixis includes some methods which are more common in animals, such as parthenogenesis. 
In botany, apomixis was defined by Hans Winkler as the replacement of the normal sexual reproduction by asexual reproduction, without fertilization. 
Horticulture methods, such as propagation from cuttings or leaves, is not apomixis. Natural replacement of the seed by an asexual method is apomixis.

Evonne Goolagong

Evonne Goolagong-Cawley, AO, MBE (born 31 July 1951) is an Australian tennis player. She was one of the world's most successful players in the 1970s and early 1980s. She ranked No. 1 in the world in 1976.
Goolagong won 14 Grand Slam titles. She won the women's title in singles tennis four times at the Australian Open, twice at the Wimbledon Championships, and once at the French Open. The other Grand Slam titles she won were in doubles tennis: six in women's doubles and one in mixed doubles.
Evonne Fay Goolagong was born in Griffith, New South Wales. She and her family are Aboriginal Australians. They belong to the Wiradjuri nation. Evonne was the third of eight children. She grew up in the small farming town of Barellan. Her father, Kenneth Goolagong, was a sheep shearer. Her family was poor. At this time, many Aboriginal people around Australia faced discrimination; they were treated differently by White Australians. However, Goolagong has said that she did not experience discrimination whilst living at Barellan.
She started playing tennis when she was a young girl. A began when Bill Kurtzman, a player at Barellan, saw Goolagong looking through the fence of the local tennis courts. He asked her if she would like to try playing. She joined the local tennis club when she was seven years old. She quickly showed a talent for the game. She was fast and had quick reflexes. She played in competitions with neighbouring towns. In 1961, Vic Edwards, the owner of a tennis school in Sydney, travelled to Barellan to watch Goolagong play. She was eleven years old at the time.
Edwards coached Goolagong and encouraged her to play tennis as a career. She left Barellan and moved to Sydney permanently in 1965, when she was aged 14. She lived with Edwards' family in their home. She went to Willoughby Girls High School, finishing in 1968. She entered the New South Wales Championship in 1967. She played in the Australian women's singles championship in January 1968. By this time she was ranked as the best junior player in New South Wales. Goolagong would later win the Australian championship four times; in 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977. She came second place in 1971, 1972 and 1973.
Goolagong won seven Grand Slam singles titles in her career. She played in eighteen Grand Slam singles finals; all except one of these were during the 1970s. Between 1971 and 1977, she reached the final of almost every Grand Slam singles event she entered.
She competed at Wimbledon for the first time in 1970. She won her first Grand Slam singles title in 1971, beating Helen Gourlay to win the French Open. A month later, she beat Margaret Court to win the Wimbledon Championship. The next year, she lost in the Wimbledon final to Billie Jean King. She lost to King again in the semi-final in 1973, and a third time in the final in 1975. She lost to Chris Evert in the final in 1976. She won the Wimbledon title for the second time in 1980, playing against Evert again in the final. Goolagong had given birth to her daughter in 1977. She became the first and only mother to win since Dorothea Douglass-Chambers 66 years before.
Goolagong reached four U.S. Open finals; in 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976. She lost them all: to Court, King, then twice to Evert. She is the only woman in the U.S. Open to have lost four finals one after the other. Goolagong made seven finals at the Australian Open, each one after the other. She won four times in a row. After having won her first French Open in 1971, Goolagong stopped competing in the tournament after 1973. She returned in 1983, and this was the last Gland Slam singles tournament she competed in. She lost to Evert.
Goolagong won six women's doubles titles. She won five at the Australian Open (in 1971, 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977), and one at Wimbledon (1974). She also won the mixed doubles title at the French Open in 1972.
Goolagong was ranked number one in the world for two weeks in 1976. However, it was not reported at the time because incomplete data were used to calculate the rankings. This was discovered in December 2007, 31 years later. She was the 16th woman to hold the top position.
Goolagong was awarded Australian of the Year in 1971. She was made an Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1972, and an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1982. She was entered into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. She was made a part of the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1988.
The National Museum of Australia holds a collection of items to remember Goolagong's career. This includes her 1971 and 1980 Wimbledon singles trophies, the trophy from her 1974 doubles win, and two racquets used in these tournaments.
Goolagong married British tennis player Roger Cawley on 19 June 1975. After their wedding, the couple settled in Naples, Florida. They lived in the U.S. for eight years. They now live in Noosa Heads, in Queensland. They have two children: Kelly and Morgan.
Goolagong played a total of 869 singles matches. Of these, she won 704 (81.01%). In Grand Slam singles tournaments, she won 82.09% of her matches (133 wins, 29 losses).

Martha Cowles Chase (November 30, 1927 – August 8, 2003), also known as Martha C. Epstein, was an American geneticist known for having experimentally showed in 1952 (with Alfred Hershey) that DNA rather than protein is the genetic material of life.
Chase was born in 1927 in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1950 she received her bachelor's degree from the College of Wooster. In 1964 Chase received her PhD from the University of Southern California.
In 1952 Chase was a young laboratory assistant to American bacteriophage expert Alfred Hershey at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory at the Carnegie Institution for Science. This was where the well-known Hershey-Chase experiment was performed. The experiment showed that it was DNA, and not protein, that was the genetic material through which traits were inherited.
A series of personal setbacks through the 1960s ended Chase's career in science. She spent decades suffering from a form of dementia that affected her short-term memory. She died of pneumonia on August 8, 2003, at the age of 75.

Gomphotherium

Gomphotherium is an extinct genus of proboscid which evolved in the lower Miocene of North America. It survived from 13.651.7 million years ago (mya).
They spread to Asia, Europe and Africa after a drop in sea level allowed them to cross over. It survived into the Pliocene, and its remains have been found in Chile, china, France, Germany, Austria, Kansas, Tennessee, Pakistan, Kenya and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"Gomphotherium" stood around high with an estimated weight of 4-5 tons, and looked similar to a modern elephant. However, it had four tusks; two on the upper jaw and two on the long lower jaw. "Gomphotherium" lived in dry wooded regions near lakes.
The lower tusks are parallel and shaped like a shovel. They may have been used to dig up food from mud. These animals probably lived in swamps or near lakes, using their tusks to dig or scrape up aquatic vegetation. 
However, wear patterns on the teeth of its relative "Platybelodon" suggest that it used its lower tusks to strip bark from trees, and may have used the sharp incisors that formed the edge of the "shovel" more like a modern-day scythe, grasping branches with its trunk and rubbing them against the lower teeth to cut it from a tree.
Unlike modern elephants, the upper tusks were covered by a layer of enamel. Compared to elephants, the skull was more elongated and low, indicating that the animal had a short trunk, rather like a tapir's. In comparison to earlier proboscids, "Gomphotherium" had fewer molars; the remaining ones had high ridges to expand their grinding surface.

Division of Dickson

The Division of Dickson is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland, Australia. It was set up in 1992 and is named after Sir James Dickson, a supporter of the Australian Federation, the Premier of Queensland and Minister for Defence in the first Australian government. It covers the outer north-western suburbs of Brisbane, including Albany Creek, Arana Hills, Bray Park, Brendale, Cashmere, Dayboro, Eatons Hill, Everton Hills, Ferny Hills, Joyner, Kallangur, Lawnton, Mount Glorious, Mount Nebo, Petrie, Samford Valley, Strathpine and Warner.
There was an unusual circumstance at the 1993 election. One of the candidates, an independent, died very shortly before the election. Because of this another election had to be called for the division a month later than the general election. The Labor Party won the election, and Prime Minister Paul Keating selected his new ministers on 27 March. He did not include an Attorney-General, keeping the position open for Michael Lavarch. Lavarch won the division, and was appointed to the ministry on 27 April.
Michael Lavarch had previously had been member for the Division of Fisher. He was Attorney-General in the Keating Government. Tony Smith did not receive Liberal Party support for the upcoming 1998 election, and so become an independent. Cheryl Kernot had been a member of the Australian Senate and leader of the Australian Democrats. She resigned, joined the Labor Party and won the division in 1998. Peter Dutton was a minister in the Howard Government and Minister for Health and Minister for Sport in the Abbott Government.

TR-069

TR-069 is a protocol that is mainly used for the communication with end-user devices, such as DSL modems. The number of such devices is rising steadily, and they are often are very difficult to configure. For that reason, TR-069 allows to configure these modems remotely. This also poses problems, because it allows to change the configuation the managed device as well as other devices, which may be behind a firewall. Since the users are not aware of the configuration changes, TR-069 can be used to introduce a backdoor. This backdoor might allow a "remote search" by police or legal authorities of a country.

Sacco and Vanzetti

Nicola Sacco (22 April 1891 – 23 August 1927) and Bartolomeo Vanzetti (11 June 1888 – 23 August 1927) were two Italian men who were convicted of murder in the United States in 1920. They were convicted of killing two men during an armed robbery in Braintree, Massachusetts.
Sacco and Vanzetti were immigrants to the country. Both were anarchists who supported rebellion against governments that were violent and oppressive.
They were put on trial in 1921. They were convicted even though evidence was clear that they had not committed the crime. This evidence involved ballistics tests and several witnesses who claimed Sacco had been in Boston and Vanzetti in Plymouth on the day of the robbery. The two men were carrying weapons when they were arrested. To explain this, Sacco and Vanzetti had to explain their anarchist beliefs in court. It is believed that this may have prejudiced the jury (influenced their decision).
The jury found Sacco and Vanzetti guilty of murder on 14 July 1921. The case drew attention from around the world. As details of the trial became public, many protests were held against their conviction. Sacco and Vanzetti were eventually executed on 23 August 1927. Since their deaths, scholars have mostly agreed that Sacco and Vanzetti were wrongfully convicted. They also did not speak English so they could not get a defense themselves. This would not have mattered because they could not afford one (they did not have enough money) anyway.

Saint Valentine's Day massacre

The Saint Valentine's Day massacre was a mass murder that took place in Chicago, Illinois on the morning of 14 February 1929. It was the most infamous event in the history of crime in the United States. 
Al Capone was the most powerful bootlegger in Chicago. By 1929 he had eliminated several of his rival crime bosses. The last one on his "list" was Bugs Moran. Capone was trying to appear as if he was retired to Florida. So Capone didn't want to be seen as starting another gang war. Instead, Capone gave the order to one of his associates, Jack McGurn, to eliminate Bugs Moran. 
On the morning of 14 February, McGurn lured Moran and his men to a warehouse on Clark street. The bait was a stolen of whisky they could buy cheap. Seven of Moran's men were there to inspect the load. A police car pulled up outside the building and several of Capone's men dressed in Chicago police uniforms went in and pretended to arrest Moran's men. When they were lined up against a wall when the killers pulled out Thompson submachine guns and opened fire. Six of the seven men were killed. Moran himself was just arriving when he saw the police car and escaped without notice.
At this time murder was not a federal offense. Most of the killers McGurn hired were from out of town. Police departments from different cities rarely could work together to solve crimes at that time. So the killers knew if they simply left Chicago after the massacre nobody could touch them.
Newspapers ran stories of the gangster shootings and prohibition in Chicago. These were complete with detailed photographs of the murders. At first many thought the Chicago police had committed the massacre. But most people in Chicago thought Al Capone was behind the murders. Capone had an . He was at his winter home in Palm Beach, Florida when the murders took place. The suspicions finally resulted in the arrests of Vincenzio Damora and John Scalise. These were two of Capone's known . Scalise was charged with the murders after Damora came up with an alibi. But Capone murdered Scalise personally before he could stand trial. also put pressure on the FBI to arrest Capone with any charge they could. In 1931 they finally charged him with tax evasion and sent him to prison. Capone was sent to Alcatraz for eleven years. When he was finally released he was too sick to continue his crime career. He died in 1947. Prohibition was repealed in 1933 which all but eliminated bootlegging.

Happisburgh footprints

The oldest hominin footprints in Europe are in Britain. They are about 800,000 years to a million years old. They were found on Happisburgh beach, East Anglia in May 2013.
The archaeologists describe them as "the oldest known hominin footprint surface outside Africa at between ca. 1 million and 0.78 million years ago". The site is known for its preservation of sediments with early Pleistocene fauna and flora. Since 2005 flint tools have been found. This means humans occupied northern Europe at least 350,000 years earlier than was thought before.
The footprints were found in sediment, partially covered by beach sand, at low tide on the shore at Happisburgh. Stormy weather had washed away the sand, leaving the sediment exposed. Because the sediment was soft, and lay below the high tide mark, the tides quickly eroded the exposed sediment, and in two weeks the footprints had all been destroyed. The team worked during low tides, often in pouring rain, to record 3D images of all the footprints.

Rum-running

Rum-running, or bootlegging, is the illegal business of taking alcoholic beverages where they are against the law. It is usually done to evade taxation or prohibition laws.
"Rum-running" usually means smuggling over water. The term is thought to come from the start of the Prohibition era in the United States. This is when ships from Bimini in the western Bahamas transported cheap rum to Florida to be sold illegally. But there was little profit in cheap rum. They soon started smuggling Canadian whisky, French champagne, and English gin to major cities like New York City and Boston. This gave them a high profit. It was said that some ships carried $200,000 worth of alcohol in a single trip.
"Bootlegging" usually means smuggling over land. It is thought the term "bootlegging" started during the American Civil War. Soldiers would sneak liquor into army camps by hiding bottles of liquor in their boots or under their trouser legs.

Shirley Temple (cocktail)

A Shirley Temple is a non-alcoholic mixed drink made with ginger ale and a splash of grenadine, mixed with a maraschino cherry. Modern Shirley Temple recipes may substitute lemon-lime soda in part, or in whole, for ginger ale. Shirley Temples are often served to children dining with adults in lieu of real cocktails, as is the similar Roy Rogers.
The cocktail may have been invented in the 1930s by a bartender at Chasen's, a restaurant in Beverly Hills, California, to serve then child actress Shirley Temple (1928–2014). However, other claims to its origin have been made. For the cocktail version of this, Shirley Temple Black (after she got married), replace ginger ale with alcoholic ginger beer, and add dark rum (or white rum and Maraschino liqueur).

Harriet Martineau

Harriet Martineau (12 June 1802 – 27 June 1876) was an English social theorist and writer. She is often called the first female sociologist.
She wrote only one book, but many essays. The essays were sociological, religious, domestic, sexual themes, with a feminine perspective. She also translated various works from Auguste Comte. She earned enough to be supported entirely by her writing. 
A young Princess Victoria, (later Queen Victoria), enjoyed reading Martineaus's publications. The Queen invited Martineau to her coronation in 1838 – an event which Martineau descibed, in great and amusing detail, to her many readers. Martineau has said of her own approach to writing: "when one studies a society, one must focus on all its aspects, including key political, religious, and social institutions". She believed a thorough analysis was necessary to understand woman's status under men.
One writer said "as a born lecturer and politician she [Martineau] was less affected by her sex than perhaps any other, male or female, of her generation". Often described as having a masculine intellect and body, Martineau introduced feminist perspectives in her writing on otherwise overlooked issues such as marriage, children, domestic and religious life, and race relations.

<doc id="438031" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=438031" title="Blackheath, London">
Blackheath, London

Blackheath is a heathland area of South East London. Formerly in Kent, it is now shared between the London Boroughs of Lewisham and Greenwich. 
Blackheath has one of the largest areas of common land in Greater London.
The name is recorded in 1166 as "Blachehedfeld" and means the "dark coloured heathland". It is formed from the Old English 'blæc' and 'hǣth' and refers to the open space that was the meeting place of the ancient hundred of Blackheath. The name was later applied to the Victorian suburb that developed in the 19th century and was extended to the areas known as Blackheath Park and Blackheath Vale.
The Roman road that later became known as Watling Street crosses the northern edge of Blackheath (almost in line with the A2).
Blackheath was a rallying point for Wat Tyler's Peasants' Revolt of 1381, and for Jack Cade's Kentish rebellion in 1450. Wat Tyler is remembered by Wat Tyler Road on the heath. After pitching camp on Blackheath, Cornish rebels were defeated in the Battle of Deptford Bridge (sometimes called the Battle of Blackheath), just to the west, on 17 June 1497.
With Watling Street carrying stagecoaches across the heath, en route to north Kent and the Channel ports, it was also a notorious haunt of highwaymen during the 17th and 18th centuries.
The sizeable estate of Blackheath Park was created on lands of Wricklemarsh Manor, and built over in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It has fine examples of substantial Georgian and Victorian houses – most notably Michael Searles' crescent of semi-detached terrace houses linked by colonnades, The Paragon (c 1793-1807). 
The Pagoda is a notable example of a beautiful property situated in Blackheath, built in 1760 by Sir William Chambers in the style of a traditional Chinese pagoda. It was later leased to the Prince Regent, who would become King George IV, and used as a summer home by his wife Caroline, Princess of Wales.
In 1608, according to tradition, Blackheath was the place where golf was introduced to England – the Royal Blackheath Golf Club. The club was one of the first golf associations established (1766) outside Scotland. Since 1923 it has been in nearby Eltham. Blackheath also gave its name to the first hockey club, established during the mid 19th century.
The Blackheath Rugby Club was founded in 1858, the oldest rugby club in England. The Blackheath club organised the world's first rugby international (between England and Scotland in Edinburgh on 27 March 1871), and hosted the first international between England and Wales ten years later. Blackheath Rugby Club was one of the 12 founding members of the Football Association in 1863.

Common land

Common land (a common) is land where local people have certain rights. For example, to allow their sheep to graze, to collect firewood, or to cut turf for fuel. 
Originally in mediaeval England the common was part of the manor. Although it was part of the estate owned by the lord of the manor, tenants had certain rights. 
By extension, the term "commons" has come to be applied to other resources which a community has rights or access to. Today the term "common" is mainly used for the land over which the rights are exercised. A person who has a right to common land is a commoner.
Today commons still exist in Great Britain and the United States, although their extent is much reduced from the millions of acres that existed in the 17th century.

<doc id="438060" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=438060" title="Japan Airlines Flight 123">
Japan Airlines Flight 123

Japan Airlines Flight 123 was a scheduled domestic flight from Tokyo's Haneda Airport (also known as Tokyo International Airport) to Osaka International Airport (Also known as Osaka Itami Airport). On August 12, 1985, the Boeing 747-146SR developed mechanical problems 12 minutes after taking off. The plane then crashed into Mount Takamagahara in Gunma Prefecture 32 minutes later, after the pilots tried to control the plane, but failed. 520 people died, and only 4 survived. The crash was caused by incorrect repair after a tailstrike incident, which caused metal fatigue and eventually an in-flight structural failure, in which the whole tail of the plane separated from the plane.
The crash was the worst plane crash involving only one plane. It was also the second worst plane crash, with the only one worse than it being the Tenerife Airport Disaster.
The plane that crashed was a Boeing 747-146SR (SR stands for short range), with tail number JA8119. The plane was used to fly short, domestic routes within Japan. The plane first flew on January 28, 1974. It had 4 Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7A engines. Before it crashed, it had flown for 25030 hours, and took off and landed 18835 times.
On June 2, 1978, JA8119 was involved in a tailstrike accident at Osaka International Airport. When landing, the plane's tail struck the runway. The aft pressure bulkhead was damaged in the accident, as well as the rear of the plane. Later, during June 17 and July 11, repairman from Boeing repaired the plane, by replacing the lower part of the rear and a part of the bulkhead. The plane later returned to service.
While investigating the accident, the investigators realised that the repair done 7 years before the accident by Boeing was incorrect. While two rows of rivets were required for a splice plate in the bulkhead to be installed, the repairman only used one row. This increased the chance of metal fatigue by 70% and also caused the subsequent accident.
On that day, the plane was flown by three crew. The 49-year-old captain, Masami Takahama, was a very experienced pilot. He has flown for 12423 hours, with 4842 hours on 747s. The 39-year-old co-pilot, Yutaka Sasaki, was training to be a captain. On that flight, he was seated on the left-seat (which is usually for captains). He has flown 3963 hours, with 2665 hours on 747s. The last crew, 46-years-old flight engineer, Hiroshi Fukuda, has flown 9831 hours, with 3846 hours on 747s. There were also 12 cabin crew.
The countries which the passengers and crew came from are listed below.
On the afternoon of the accident day, JA8119 has already completed two round trip flights, JL503/504 to and from Sapporo, and JL363/366 to and from Fukuoka. At 5.17pm, the plane has just completed flight JL366, and was parked at Spot 18 at Tokyo International Airport, getting ready for its flight to Osaka, JL123. 
At 6.04pm, the plane started taxiing towards the runway. Takeoff was at 6.12pm, and the plane climbed to its cruising height of 24000ft (about 7300 metres). Till then, everything was fine.
At 6.24pm, there was suddenly a loud noise heard, which was actually caused by the pressure bulkhead's failure. This caused an explosive decompression. Air rushed out of the plane and blew off the tail of the plane. As all four hydraulic lines, which control the plane, are located in the tail, the plane became uncontrollable. 46 seconds later the pilots squawked 7700 (meaning that they are in an emergency) and requested to return to Tokyo International Airport. However, although the air traffic controller approved the plane to turn towards Tokyo, the plane strangely started heading towards the north-west direction. At 6.28pm, the Tokyo Air Traffic Controller asked the pilots to turn left, but received the message from the pilots, "now uncontrollable." By then, the plane was moving in a way called the phugoid motion, climbing until losing speed and stalling, then the nose goes down and gaining speed until the plane is able to climb again. The phugoid motion repeated itself until the end of the flight.
At 6.31pm, the air traffic controller asked the plane if it can land at Nagoya Airport, which was 72 miles (about 133 km) from the plane. However, the pilots wanted to return to Tokyo. Between 6.35pm and 6.56pm, the pilots struggled to control the plane without the tail. This failed, as the plane flew uncontrollably towards the mountains.
At 6.56pm, the plane's right wing hit a ridge. The plane then flew on, crashed into a second ridge, and exploded. 520 died, while 4 survives.
The time taken for the plane to crash after the bulkhead failure is 32 minutes. The accident was the worst in aviation history involving explosive decompression.

Oncogene

An oncogene is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer. Or, equally good, an oncogene is a gene which brings about uncontrolled cell division.
Oncogenes in tumor cells are often mutated or expressed at high levels.
Most normal cells undergo a programmed form of death (apoptosis). Activated oncogenes can cause those cells designated for apoptosis to survive and proliferate instead. Most oncogenes require an additional step, such as mutations in another gene, or environmental factors, such as viral infection, to cause cancer. Since the 1970s, dozens of oncogenes have been identified in human cancer. Many cancer drugs target the proteins coded by oncogenes.
In 1976 J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus of the University of California, San Francisco showed that oncogenes were activated proto-oncogenes, found in many organisms including humans. For this discovery Bishop and Varmus were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1989.
The work of Bishop and Varmus corrected a long-standing error. The Nobel citation includes this explanation:
In fact, the reverse transcription of the virus RNA into DNA had the effect that the oncogenes become integrated into the chromosomal DNA in the cells. It was then found that oncogene-like material could be detected in different species throughout the animal kingdom, in fact even in simple organisms with only a few cells. Furthermore, it was shown that the gene had a fixed position in the chromosomes of a certain species, and that the gene, when it constituted part of the cellular genetic material, was divided into fragments.
A proto-oncogene is a normal gene that can become an oncogene due to mutations or increased expression. The resultant protein can be called an oncoprotein. Proto-oncogenes code for proteins that help to regulate cell growth and differentiation. Proto-oncogenes are often involved in signal transduction and execution of mitogenic signals, usually through their protein products. Upon "activation", a proto-oncogene (or its product) becomes a tumor-inducing agent, an oncogene. 
The MYC gene is implicated in Burkitt's Lymphoma. This starts when a chromosomal translocation moves an enhancer sequence close to the MYC gene. The MYC gene codes for widely used transcription factors. When the enhancer sequence is wrongly placed, these transcription factors are produced at much higher rates. Another example of an oncogene is the Bcr-Abl gene found on the 'Philadelphia Chromosome'. This is a piece of genetic material seen in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, caused by the translocation of pieces from chromosomes 9 and 22. Bcr-Abl codes for a receptor tyrosine kinase, which is active, causing uncontrolled cell proliferation.

The South African Air Force (SAAF) is the air force of the South African National Defence Force.
The South African Air Force goes back to 1912, when the Union Defence Force (UDF) was created. The UDF had included the South African Aviation Corps (SAAC), which was part of the Active Citizen Force (ACF). On 1 February 1920, the South African Air Force was created. The SAAF fought in several battles during World War II, the Korean War, and the South African Border War.
The South African Air Force has about 226 aircraft and 11,245 active military personnel. The aircraft are mostly European-made. However some, such as the Denel Rooivalk and the Atlas Oryx were designed and built in South Africa. The Swedish Saab JAS 39 Gripen is the standard aircraft of the Air Force.

The Navajo People (Navajo: Diné or Naabeehó) are a tribe of Native Americans from the southwestern part of the United States. The Navajo tribe has about 300,000 members. It is the second largest tribe in the United States. The Navajo Nation is an independent government that runs a large Native American reservation in parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. Many Navajo live there, but not all of them. Most Navajo speak English. Some speak the Navajo language, The Navajo have many things in common with the Apache tribe, and the two groups may share a common ancestry.
The Navajo Nation works to maintain an economy for a population of 250,000 plus members. The discovery of oil on Navajo lands in the 1920s started the tribe towards building a systematic form of government. A tribal government was established in 1923 to deal with oil exploration. The Navajo Nation is currently the largest and most sophisticated form of Native American government. The Navajo Nation has become a wealthy nation in it's own rite.
Navajo code talkers were bilingual Navajo speakers who were recruited during World War II by the U.S. Marines. They served in their standard communications units in the Pacific Theater. The Navajo code was created by the first 29 Navajo recruits in May of 1942. About 400 Navajos were trained as code talkers. Their training was intense and all 17 pages of the code had to be memorized. From 1942 to 1945 Navajo Code Talkers took part in every Marine assault in the Pacific Theatre. Navajos served in all six Marine divisions plus parachute units and the Marine Raider battalions. They transmitted messages on the battlefield including orders, troop movements and logistics. While the Japanese were able to break codes used by the United States Army and the United States Army Air Corps, they were never able to break the Marine codes. Even a Navajo soldier captured during the Battle of Bataan could not figure out the code for the Japanese. Major Howard Connor, a 5th Marine Division signal officer at Iwo Jima stated: "Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima." On September 17, 1992, the Navajo code talkers of World War II were honored for their contributions at the Pentagon in Washington, DC. The long delay was due to the Navajo code being Classified information.

The Stasi was the official state security service of East Germany, the German Democratic Republic or GDR. The Stasi motto was "Schild und Schwert der Partei" (Shield and Sword of the Party). "The Party" was the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany. The main job of the Stasi was to prevent opposition to the Party.
It was one of the most effective and ruthless secret police agencies in the world. The Stasi headquarter was in East Berlin, with a group of buildings in Lichtenberg and several other buildings in Berlin. 
One of its main tasks was spying on the people, through a vast network of citizens who were informants ("snitches"). Informants were paid, or given favours for this. 
The Stasi also worked as an intelligence agency abroad, using espionage and covert operations in foreign countries. Under its long-time head Markus Wolf it got a reputation as one of the most effective intelligence agencies of the Cold War. After German reunification in 1990, many Stasi officials were prosecuted for their crimes. The files that the Stasi had kept on millions of East Germans were laid open. Now citizens can see their personal files on request; these files are kept by the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Archives.

Chemical synapse

Chemical synapses are synapses that use chemical messengers called neurotransmitters to transmit signals. They are found all over the body. Especially in the central nervous system and the brain.
Neurons use electrical signals to carry information. These signals are called action potentials. There are an estimated 86 billion neurons in the average human brain. Neurons don't act alone. They need to connect to other neurons and pass messages between each other. The electrical signal cannot pass the gap between neurons alone. This is why neurotransmitters are needed to pass signals from one neuron to the next. In this sense they differ from electrical synapses which pass electric signals directly to the next neuron. Chemical synapses can be further classified depending upon function and structure.
The structure of a typical chemical synapse comes in three parts:

General Medical Council

The General Medical Council (GMC) is a fee-based registered charity with statutory obligation to maintain a register of medical practitioners within the United Kingdom. Registration with the GMC confers a number of privileges and duties.
There is a legal requirement for a register, the list of "registered medical practitioners" in Britain. That is the main job of the GMC. The GMC controls entry to the List of Registered Medical Practitioners ("the medical register"). "The main objective of the General Council in exercising their functions is to protect, promote and maintain the health and safety of the public".
Secondly, the GMC regulates and sets the standards for medical schools in the UK. It liaises with other nations' medical and university regulatory bodies over medical schools overseas, leading to some qualifications being mutually recognised. Since 2010, it also regulates postgraduate medical education.
Thirdly, the GMC is responsible for a licensing and revalidation system for all practising doctors in the UK, separate from the registration system. This was done by order of the Privy Council on 3 December 2012.
Citizens have a right to free choice in a democracy. Therefore, medical activities by an unregistered person is not absolutely banned:
However, most activities connected with being a doctor are effectively banned:

Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall

The Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall is the largest known super-structure in the universe.
It is a huge group of galaxies forming a giant sheet-like pattern. It is about 10 billion light-years long, 7.2 billion light-years wide, and almost 1 billion light-years thick. It is about 10 billion light-years away in the constellations of Hercules and Corona Borealis, hence its name.
It was discovered in November 2013 by mapping gamma-ray bursts. They are very luminous explosions of distant, massive stars, the most powerful explosions in the universe. A typical burst releases more energy in less than a tenth of a second than the Sun will in its whole life of 10 billion years. 
Gamma-ray bursts are very rare: only one happens in a typical galaxy every few million years. The stars which cause these explosions are very massive, so the material required for them to be formed must be in great amounts. So, these explosions can be used to track down if there is a galaxy in that direction, or there is a large group of matter in there.
Between the years of 1997 to 2012, astronomers mapped these bursts in the sky, with the help of the robotic satellites Swift and Fermi which looks for gamma-ray bursts and measures their redshifts. In the map they produced, they noticed something interesting; 14 gamma-ray bursts have very similar redshifts and are very close to each other. This means that there is a very large group of galaxies and matter in the region. They say, from measuring these bursts, comes up with a very large structure measuring 10 billion light-years in diameter.
For comparison, the Milky Way, the galaxy we live in, measures only 100,000 light-years, and the distance from the Milky Way to the Andromeda Galaxy measures only 2.5 million light-years. The Huge-LQG (the Huge Large Quasar Group), the previous largest structure in the universe, is 4 billion light-years long.
The discovery of the Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall contradicts a theory proposed by Albert Einstein known as the cosmological principle. The cosmological principle says that the entire universe is approximately equal; any two regions in the universe will look very similar, even if those two regions are very far apart, assuming those regions have sizes larger than 250 to 300 million light-years. Maximum sizes of structures must be around 1.2 billion light-years based on the meaning above, and no structure must be larger than that, assuming that matter is spreaded equally from the Big Bang. However, the structure, is eight times larger than the limit, contradicting the cosmological principle.
The structure also contradicts theories about the evolution of the universe. The structure is 10 billion light-years away, which means that we see the structure 10 billion years ago, when the universe is only 13.8 billion years old, and its light was just approaching us. The 13.8 billion year span of time is "too short for a giant structure 10 billion light-years long to form". Even Istvan Horvath, the discoverer of the structure, says he has no idea how the structure has formed in that amount of time. For now, the existence of the structure is still a mystery for cosmologists.

Academic art

Academic art was an artistic style that was popular from the 17th to the 19th century. Different art schools laid down rules on what a good painting or artwork shouls look like. Academic art was influenced by these rules, and was about applying them when creating a work of art. Academic art is a form of Realism in art. One of the main ideas that influenced academic art was that of Aristotle: A work of art should give a selective, but true copy of a part of reality. This idea was transformed into the concept of mimesis, or imitation. Together with thisidea, there were a number of subjects that were acceptable for painting or sculpture. Very often, the subjects came from mythology
The École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris had a lot of influence on the movement. At the time Neoclassicism and Romanticism were the main movements at the school. 
With later art styles, especially that of impressionism, academic art losts its importance.
Well known artists who painted in the academic art style include William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Alexandre Cabanel, Eugene de Blaas, Edward Poynter, Wilhelm Bendz and Alexander Ivanov.

Hall boy

The hall boy or hallboy was the lowest ranked male domestic worker on the staff of a great house. Usually a boy or young teenager, his name derived from the fact that his main duties were in the servants' hall, where he may also have slept. 
Like his female counterpart, the scullery maid, the hall boy would have been expected to work up to 16 hours per day, seven days per week. His duties were often among the most disagreeable in the house, such as emptying chamber pots for the higher-ranking servants, and (in the absence of a boot boy) cleaning the boots. 
A hall boy could rise through the ranks and, if fortunate, eventually become a valet or butler. Arthur Inch, butler technical consultant for the film "Gosford Park", stated in an interview that he began his life in service as a hall boy at the age of 15.

United States debt ceiling

The United States debt ceiling is a limit set by congress that tells how much money the government can borrow at any given time. Its basic purpose is to try to lower the national debt or prevent excessive borrowing. The debt ceiling was created in 1917 under the Second Liberty Bond Act. It was designed to fund the US as it entered World War I. Before the creation of the debt ceiling, the president determined how much debt could be incurred in a given time. This was changed in 1917 to prevent the president from having too much borrowing power. The debt ceiling in 2011 was 14.3 trillion dollars.

Public-private partnership

A public-private partnership is a contract between the public sector, or government, and a private company. The purpose for such public-private partnerships is to provide public services, like education and transportation. This is without changing the private business into a government-operated service. One way of doing this is to allow the government to pay the business for providing free services to the public. The business provides the services for free and then charges the government for compensation, in which the government agrees. Supporters of public-private partnerships argue that it reduces inefficiency and provides the free market with greater flexibility.

His father was Fritz Von Erich, a wrestling promoter and professional wrestler. Mike made his professional wrestling debut on November 24, 1983. Unlike his older brothers, however, he never wanted to do wrestling (according to certain wrestlers tied to Mike, including his brother Kevin).
In 1985, Von Erich was diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome (rare among men). The condition caused brain damage that then affected his behavior and overall performing abilities.
In April 1987, he was arrested for drunk driving and drug charges. A few days later, Mike wrote and left a suicide note for his family, went to Lake Dallas and overdosed on Placidyl and alcohol. His body was found four days later.

Polymyalgia rheumatica

Polymyalgia rheumatica ("PMR", sometimes called just polymyalgia) is a disease that causes pain in the muscles. Most people with PMR have pain during the morning. Sometimes the pain is in the late afternoon or evening. About 15% of people having PMR may also have temporal arteritis.
PMR usually affects women. Men can have it also.
PMR usually happens in people age fifty and older. People under age 50 can be affected, although only rarely.
Recent research now seems to point to both polymyalgia and celiac disease having a common cause: an intolerance to gluten found in wheat, barley and rye. Celiac disease has been known since the 1940s, but recent research has shown that although the cause is the same, symptoms are different. Celiac disease causes painful gastrointestinal symptoms, but polymyalgia causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and limited range of motion in the shoulders, neck, upper arms, and hips.

Dinosaur renaissance

Dinosaur renaissance is a term coined in a 1975 issue of "Scientific American" by Robert Bakker to describe the renewed interest in paleontology. This has lasted from the 1970s to the present. It was caused by a great increase in dinosaur discoveries, and by new ideas of how they lived. 
The "renaissance", a word which means "rebirth", changed how dinosaurs pictured both by professional illustrators, and in the public eye. 
John Ostrom's 1964 discovery of "Deinonychus" is one of the most important fossil finds. "Deinonychus" was an active predator that clearly killed its prey by leaping and slashing or stabbing with its "terrible claw". Evidence of a truly active lifestyle included long strings of tendons running along the tail, making it a stiff counterbalance for jumping and running. One conclusion was that at least some dinosaurs had a high metabolism, and so in some cases were warm-blooded. This was popularized by Ostrom's student Robert Bakker. The impression of dinosaurs as being slow, cold-blooded, small-brained reptiles needed to be rethought, at least for some of the carnivores.
These are the main points:
The discovery of new feathered dinosaurs in China has kept the field in the forefront of research and populat attention. Lower Cretaceous geological formations in the northeastern Chinese province of Liaoning are especially noteworthy. The animals found there are known as the Jehol biota.

Maria I of Portugal

Maria I (English: "Mary I") (17 December 1734 – 20 March 1816) was the Queen of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Known as Maria the Pious (in Portugal), or Maria the Mad (in Brazil), she was the first undisputed Queen (in her own right) of Portugal. Her court, then under the direction of her eldest son and heir Dom João, the , moved to the then Portuguese colony of Brazil. Later on, Brazil would be elevated from the rank of a colony to that of a Kingdom. This led to the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.
Maria was born at the Ribeira Royal Palace in Lisbon. On the day of her birth, her grandfather, King João V, created her the Princess of Beira. She was the eldest of all her four siblings.
When her father succeeded to the throne in 1750 as José I, Maria became his heiress presumptive and was given the traditional titles of Princess of Brazil and Duchess of Braganza. She was also an Infanta of Portugal from birth and thus entitled to the style of Royal Highness. She grew up during the dominating Marquis of Pombal
In 1760 Maria married her uncle Pedro, younger brother of her father Jose I. They had six children, of whom the eldest surviving son succeeded Maria as João VI on her death in 1816.

The American lion ("Panthera leo" or "P. atrox") is also known as Naegele’s giant jaguar or American cave lion. It is an extinct species of lion which lived in North America during the Pleistocene (340,000 years ago to 11,000 years ago). It existed for about 330,000 thousand years.
The American lion belonged to the family Felidae. By analysing the species' genes, scientists have shown that it shared the same ancestor as the Eurasian cave lion ("Panthera leo spelaea" or "P. spelaea"). Most remains have come from the La Brea tar pits.
The American lion was large, slightly larger than the early middle Pleistocene cave lion, "P. leo fossilis" and about 25% larger than the modern African lion. There is no evidence that it was a social hunter like the modern lion, and that may explain its size.
"Panthera leo atrox" hunted large mammals such as horses, camels, bison and mammoth.

A police dog (also called a K-9) is a dog trained to help police and other law enforcement people. German Shepherds are the most common breed, but other breeds are also used. If a police dog is killed in duty, it is usually given a full police funeral. K-9s are often given their own ballistic vests, and some are given their own police IDs and badges.
A police dog may be trained to do one special thing, or a few different things. Common K-9 jobs include: 
There are also specialized police dogs, who are used only for a specific job because they have special skills or training for that job. For example:
Different breeds of police dogs tend to be good at different things. However, any good police dog should be intelligent, aggressive, strong, and have a good sense of smell. Many police dogs are male and unneutered (because neutering can make a dog less aggressive). However, there are female police dogs, which are used for rescue, tracking, and locating bombs and drugs. German Shepherd Dogs and Belgian Malinois are the most commonly used; however, other dog breeds (and their specialties) include:

Dara Howell

Dara Howell (born August 23, 1994 in Huntsville, Ontario) is a Canadian freestyle skier. She skied for Canada at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and became the first freestyle skier to win a gold medal in slopestyle at the inaugural event. She has also competed in women's slopestyle at the Winter X Games XVII in Aspen, Colorado where she won a bronze medal.
Howell dedicated her win to Sarah Burke and said: "Oh, my God. I don't know what to say. I can't believe it. It is so surreal and I am so happy to win a gold medal for Canada. I don't think it will hit me until later. It is truly amazing. There are a number of really good girls out there and I came out on top. This is the best moment in my entire life...I said it earlier this week, I hope a Canadian brings home a gold medal for Sarah. I can't believe it's me. It's totally for Sarah and I cannot believe it."

Tarsal formula

The tarsal formula is the number of segments on the tarsi of arthropods. The tarsus is the bottom part of an arthropod's legs, see diagram.
The formula has 3 numbers a-b-c, starting with the front leg (a), then the middle leg (b), then the hind leg (c). For example, a tarsal formula of "5-5-4" means there are 5 segments in the fore leg's tarsi, 5 segments in the middle leg's tarsi, and 4 segments in the hind leg's tarsi. This character is especially useful at family rank and higher.
The characteristic is useful when identifying insects.

Leaf beetle

Leaf beetles are the family Chrysomelidae. There are over 35,000 species in more than 2,500 genera, so it is one of the largest and most common of all beetle families. Many subfamilies are recognized.
Leaf beetles have a tarsal formula which appears to be 4-4-4, but is actually 5-5-5. Some are difficult to tell from long-horned beetles (family Cerambycidae): it is done by the antennae "not" arising from frontal tubercles.
Adult and larval leaf beetles feed on all sorts of plant tissue. Their diversity has run parallel with that of the Angiosperms. Many are serious pests of cultivated plants, for example the Colorado potato beetle ("Leptinotarsa decemlineata"), the asparagus beetle ("Crioceris asparagi"), the cereal leaf beetle ("Oulema melanopus"), and various flea beetles. A few act as vectors of plant diseases. Others can be used as biocontrol of invasive weeds. Most Chrysomelidae are conspicuously coloured, often in glossy yellow to red or metallic blue-green hues. Some (especially Cassidinae) have spectacularly bizarre shapes. They are highly popular among insect collectors.
Selection of notable sub-families:
Records from the Cretaceous period are scarce: only three records are known. An early Cretaceous origin from a more general form is suggested by Grimaldi and Engel. Then came an Upper Cretaceous divergence of Chrysolmelid sub-groups, and adaptive radiation connected to that of the flowering plants.

House of Braganza

The House of Braganza (Portuguese: Casa de Bragança; Portuguese pronunciation: [bɾɐˈɣɐ̃sɐ]), officially the Most Serene House of Braganza (Portuguese: "Sereníssima Casa de Bragança"), is an important imperial, royal, and noble house (dynasty) of Portuguese origin. It is a branch of the House of Aviz. The House changed from being powerful dukes of Portuguese nobility, to ruling as the monarchs of Portugal and the Algarves, from 1640 to 1910. They were also monarchs of Brazil, from 1815 to 1889. The heir to the Portugese throne was usually given the title of "Duke of Braganza".
The House of Braganza was founded in 1442. This is when Afonso, 8th Count of Barcelos, was made Duke of Braganza. Alfonso (Alfonso I) was an illegitimate son of King João I of Portugal, of the House of Aviz. He was made a duke by his nephew, King Afonso V of Portugal. The feudal dukes quickly collected a fortune in properties, titles, and power. By the mid 1600s, the House was the most powerful in all of Portugal. It was also of the greatest houses of Iberia.
The House of Braganza became the reigning house of Brazil, first, when the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves was created in 1815. The United Kingdom lasted until 1822, when the Brazilian Empire became independent from Portugal. The new Brazilian nation was led by Prince Pedro of Braganza, heir to the Portuguese throne, who ruled as Emperor Pedro I of Brazil, as well as King Pedro IV of Portugal. Until 1835, the Portuguese Braganzas were still in the line of succession to the Brazilian throne. The House was deposed (removed) from the Brazilian throne, in 1889, when Brazil was proclaimed a republic.
The House continued to be the house to the Brazilian throne until 1921. This is when Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil, daughter of Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, died. Her claim passed to her son, Prince Pedro Henrique of Orléans and Braganza. Thus the House of Orléans-Braganza became the claimant house to the former monarchy of Brazil. Pedro Henrique died in 1981. The current claimant is his eldest son, Prince Luiz.
In Portugal, King Carlos I of Portugal was assassinated in 1908. Also killed in the attack was his eldest son. His younger son, Manuel II, became king. When the Portuguese Republic was established, in 1910, King Manuel II and the rest of the Braganzas went into exile.

The common yabby, "Cherax destructor", is an Australian freshwater crustacean. It is in the Parastacidae family. It is listed as a vulnerable species of crayfish by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). But wild yabby populations remain strong, and have expanded into new habitats created by reservoirs and farm dams.
Its common name of "yabby" is also applied to many other Australian "Cherax" species of crustacean. The name is also applied marine ghost shrimp of the infra-order Thalassinidea. Yabbies occasionally reach up to 30 cm (12 in) in length but are more commonly 10–20 cm (4–8 in) long.
Colour is highly variable and depends on water clarity (how clear it is) and habitat. Yabbies can range from black, blue-black or dark brown in clear waters to light brown, green-brown or beige in dark waters. Yabbies specifically bred to be a vibrant blue colour are now popular in the aquarium trade in Australia.

Hague Adoption Convention

The Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (or simply Hague Adoption Convention), provides certain protections to children. It guarantees the protection of children from child trafficking. It also guarantees them safe adoption and a quick adoption process. 
In May 1993 the proposal was presented at the seventeenth session of The Hague Convention. It became effective in 1995. The United States ratified the Hague Adoption Convention in December of 2007. Forty-six countries had ratified the treaty as of May of 2002. Thirteen more had yet to ratify it. Many countries which have not ratified the Convention do not permit foreign adoptions of their children nor adoptions of foreign children. For example Muslim countries do not permit foreign adoptions.
Adopting children from one country into a family from another is a relatively new idea. It developed after World War II. By the 1970s it became a fairly common event. But it was soon recognized this was creating a number of legal and human problems. There were few domestic and international laws that adequately protected children's rights. The Hague Adoption Convention of 1993 addressed these concerns. The Convention gave the responsibility of providing the protection against child trafficking, safe adoption and a quick adoption process to the countries and to adoption agencies.
The convention also raised several ethical concerns. In a normal domestic adoption the child loses connections and identification with their biological family. In an international adoption a child may also lose identification with their nationality and ethnicity. Adoptions that span countries should be considered only after all efforts to place adopted children within their own country. UNICEF, by comparison, does not encourage international adoptions. They encourage nations to adopt within their own country.
There has been a sharp decline in international adoptions in the last few years. Romania, for one, has ended all foreign adoptions. Belarus and the Ukraine closed foreign adoptions for 2007. The 5000 adoptions from China in 2005 dropped to 4000 in 2006. Wars and natural disasters were the reasons for massive adoptions from the affected countries in the past. But the international community is no longer in favor of this as a solution. Adoptions from Africa are increasing, however. The number of Orphans from Liberia and Ethiopia have increased from 2006–2008. But the costs to adopt a child from another country have risen. This is due in part to the steps taken by the convention to prevent abuse of the system.

<doc id="439025" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=439025" title="Equal Pay Act of 1963">
Equal Pay Act of 1963

The Equal Pay Act of 1963 is a Federal law that amends the Fair Labor Standards Act. It prohibits wage based solely on gender. It was signed into law on June 10, 1963 by John F. Kennedy, who at that time was President of the United States. The principle was equal pay for equal work regardless of sex.
In 1868 a major objective of the Knights of Labor was equal pay for men and women. During World War I and World War II the National War Labor Board had the power to set labor standards for American businesses. During the Korean War the Wage Stabilization Board set these standards. In all three cases they set equal pay policies for both sexes during . During the war, Rosie the Riveter was paid the same wage as males doing the same job. In 1919 two states, Michigan and Montana, passed equal pay laws. But it wasn't until after World War II that any other states followed their examples. The United States Women's Bureau, a part of the United States Department of Labor, was established in 1920. Since their start they have pushed for equal pay. In 1952 the National Committee for Equal Pay was established as a coalition of several woman's, labor, business, and civic group|groups. They began a campaign for new laws requiring equal pay. In 1945 the 79th Congress introduced an equal pay bill that did not pass. It was 18 years later when the 88th Congress passed such legislation. It was called the Equal Pay Act of 1963.
As an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Equal Pay Act of 1963 made it against Federal law to discriminate against workers on the basis of gender. This is when "tasks require equal skill, effort, and responsibility under similar working conditions." President John F. Kennedy signed this into law on June, 10 1963. At the ceremony held in the Oval Office of the White House president Kennedy gave special recognition to several groups and individuals who worked towards this law. Among those honored were Congresswomen Edna Kelly and Edith Green, Assistant Secretary of Labor Esther Peterson, National Council of Negro Women President Dr. Dorothy Height and Business and Professional Women's Foundation President Dr. Minnie Miles.
The act passed largely due to Congress recognizing the changing in the United States. Male-supported households were becoming obsolete as more women entered the workforce. Higher divorce rates meant more female-supported households. But in the 1960s women earned only 60 cents for every dollar paid to male workers. The Equal Pay Act was intended as part of the solution to unequal pay. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII, added more to the Equal Pay Act by making it unlawful to discriminate based on race "or" sex. Title VII also added White-collar worker to the Act.
By the 1970s women were earning 75 cents per male-earned dollar. According to US Department of Labor statistics, in 2007 the rate was still at about 75 cents. The gap between college educated women and college educated men has actually widened slightly. In Fortune 500 companies (top US corporations) women still hold only about 17% of top positions. As of 2010 the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that women who worked earned about 81 cents for every (full-time) male-earned dollar.

<doc id="439036" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=439036" title="Miranda v. Arizona">
Miranda v. Arizona

Miranda v. Arizona, , was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court. The Court ruled that a suspect in police custody must be informed of the right to consult with an attorney before and during questioning. They must be informed of the right against self-incrimination. They must also make certain the suspect understands these rights.
The Miranda warning (often abbreviated to "Miranda," or "Mirandizing" a suspect) is the name of the formal warning that is required to be given by police in the United States to criminal suspects. It must be given before they are interrogated, in accordance with the "Miranda" ruling. Its purpose is to ensure the accused are aware of these rights under the U.S. Constitution. Also so they know they know they can invoke them at any time during the interview.
On 13 March 1963, Ernesto Miranda was arrested by police officers in Phoenix, Arizona. Miranda asked why he was being arrested but was given no answer. At the time of his arrest he was not charged with any crime. Ten days earlier an 18-year old girl claimed she had been sexually assaulted. When she talked to the police, her story changed several times. A few days later she was leaving work and saw a suspicious car she thought might be the same as the one used in her assault. A partial license plate led police to arrest and question Miranda. In a lineup, the girl could not identify her attacker but thought he looked similar to Miranda. During the interview with Miranda, police told the suspect he failed the lineup. After hours of interrogation Miranda finally signed a confession. Police also got Miranda to confess to two other cases of abduction and robbery which "cleared" two more cases.
The case of Ernesto Miranda and three other similar cases were heard before the Supreme Court. All four defendants did not have attorneys present when they were questioned. The decision was announced on 13 June 1966 by Chief Justice Earl Warren. Because of the important changes it made, he read the entire sixty pages. Four justices disagreed with the ruling. Their argument was that all the defendants confessed. Their opinion was that allowing lawyers in interrogations would prevent most suspects from confessing.
As a result Ernesto Miranda's first conviction was overturned but he faced a second trial on sexual assault and kidnapping charges in 1967. His confession could not be used against him but the prosecutor got Miranda's girlfriend to testify he told her he did it. She said it happened three days after his police confession. He was found guilty and got the same sentence again.
There are some 17,000 police departments in the United States. They use any of hundreds of different versions of the Miranda warning. These range from a few words to over 400. One reason is that many fall into vulnerable groups who do not always understand written or oral Miranda warnings. These include those who are deaf, do not speak or read English well, juveniles, mentally ill, and or the mentally challenged. The courts have been less than protective of the rights of these groups who may not have understood their Miranda rights.
Like the Miranda warnings, other countries have written rights they give to suspects before police begin their questioning. They have procedures to insure a confession is valid in their court systems. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for example, provides that if someone is arrested they have certain rights. These are to be promptly told why they were arrested, told they have a right to retain legal council and the right of proof of habeas corpus (or be released from custody).

Leishmaniasis

Leishmaniasis or leishmaniosis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus "Leishmania". It is spread by the bite of certain types of sandflies.
The disease has three forms:
Leishmaniasis in humans is caused by more than 20 species of "Leishmania". Risk factors include poverty, malnutrition, deforestation and urbanization. All three types can be diagnosed by identifying the parasites under a microscope. The visceral form can be diagnosed with a blood test.
Leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Another way is using insecticides to kill sandflies. Early treatment of people with the disease also helps prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of "Leishmania" and the type of infection. Medications used for the visceral form include: liposomal amphotericin B, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin, and miltefosine. For the cutaneous form, paromomycin, fluconazole or pentamidine can help.
As of 2014, about 12 million people are infected in some 98 countries. There are about 2 million new cases each year. Each year, between 20 thousand and 50 thousand people die from the disease. About 200 million people in Asia, Africa, South and Central America and southern Europe live in areas where the disease is common. The World Health Organization has gotten discounts on some medications to treat the disease.
The parasites that cause the disease also infect other mammals: The disease has been described in dogs, cats, rodents, cattle and horses. In addition to the mammal, the parasite needs an insect that spreads the parasite through its sting. 
Leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of infected female sandflies. These can transmit the infection "Leishmania". The sandflies inject the infective stage, metacyclic promastigotes, during blood meals (1). Metacyclic promastigotes that reach the puncture wound are phagocytized by macrophages (2) and transform into amastigotes (3). Amastigotes multiply in infected cells and affect different tissues, depending in part on which "Leishmania" species is involved (4). The differences in the type of tissue affected are responsible for the different visible types of leishmaniasis. Sandflies become infected during blood meals on infected hosts when they ingest macrophages infected with amastigotes (5,6). In the sandfly's midgut, the parasites differentiate into promastigotes (7), which multiply, differentiate into metacyclic promastigotes, and migrate to the proboscis (8).
The genomes of three "Leishmania" species have been sequenced and this has provided much information about the biology of the parasite. "Leishmania" has unique features with respect to the regulation of gene expression in response to changes in the environment. The new knowledge from these studies may help identify new targets for drugs and aid the development of vaccines.

Geocentrism

Geocentrism is the belief that the Earth is fixed at the centre of the Universe. Geocentrists accept that the earth is round. Before the 16th century most people believed in the theory of geocentrism. From Earth, it looks like the Sun and stars are moving across the sky. Geocentrism is connected with the Ancient Greek philosopher, Ptolemy. From the time of Ptolemy round the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD through to the time of Copernicus round the 15th and 16th Centuries AD educated people who knew the earth is round almost always believed the Geocentric theory of Ptolemy.
From the 15th to the 17th century, astronomers, especially Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler, found evidence that the Earth is not fixed but moves round the Sun. That is called heliocentrism.
Geocentrism has been proven to be incorrect. However, there are still geocentrists today. In the United States, the National Science Foundation found that about 25% of Americans believe in geocentrism.

Young Earth creationism

Young Earth creationism (YEC) is the belief that the God of Judaism or Christianity created the Universe, the Earth and all life on Earth over a short time between 5,700 and 10,000 years ago. Those who believe young Earth creationism are mainly Christians and Jews. They believe the Genesis account of creation in the Bible is completely true. Young Earth creationists believe that God created the Earth in six 24-hour days. They disagree with other creationists because they believe the Bible is literally true when it tells the age of the Earth. 
Many scientists agree together that young Earth creationism is wrong and know about experiments and observations (facts that scientists have seen, heard, recorded with their instruments) in their theory. Scientists believe that the universe is more than 13 billion years old while the earth existed for 4.5 billion years according to scientific theory.

Tsarevich of Russia

The title of Tsarevich of Russia was traditionally used by the heir apparent or heir presumptive in the Russian Empire. The title was used with the style "Imperial Highness". The title was usually only used by males due to females being prevented from succeeding the throne after Catherine the Great. 
It is often confused with "tsarevich", which is the title for any son of a tsar. Normally, there was only one "tsesarevich" at a time (an exception was Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich, who was accorded the title until death, even though law gave it to his nephew), and the title was used exclusively in Russia. 
The title came to be used together with the formal style "successor" ("Naslednik"), as in "His Imperial Highness the Successor Tsesarevich and Grand Duke". The wife of the "Tsesarevich" was the Tsesarevna.

He called Morocco "Maghreb al-Aksa" (meaning the farthest west). In 788, The Zaydi Shia Idrisids ruled large parts of Morocco. Later, several Berbers formed more powerful Islamic dynasties that reigned over the country. Among them were the Almoravids, who were the first to unite Morocco. They also united significant regions in West Africa, Spain and Algeria. These Almoravids were responsible for making the Maliki school the most prominent in Morocco.

Sandfly

Sandflies are a group of flies, many of which feed on blood and are vectors of parasites. 
The group is the Phlebotominae, a subfamily of flies. Parasitic diseases spread by the flies include leishmaniasis, bartonellosis and pappataci fever. In the New World leishmaniasis is spread by sand flies in the genus "Lutzomyia". "Lutzomyia" often live in caves, where their main hosts are bats. In the Old World sand flies in the genus "Phlebotomus" spread leishmaniasis.
Phlebotomine females, and only females, suck blood from various mammals, reptiles and birds. Some species are selective, whereas others bite any suitable host they find. As far as is known all species need a blood meal for every following clutch of eggs after the first. Proteins and other nutrients in the blood enable the female to produce eggs. 
The flies use their mouthparts to start the host bleeding. They then suck up the exposed blood. Like practically all blood-feeding parasites, they inject biochemicals that inhibit blood clotting, plus some that stimulate host mast cells to produce histamine; this distend capillary vessels, thereby promoting blood flow.
One blood meal can support the production of about 100 eggs. Females lay their eggs in humid soil rich in organic matter.
Sand flies are small; a body size of about 3mm in length is typical. This helps them in escape notice. Their bite is not always felt, but leaves a small round, reddish bump that starts itching hours or days later. Use of insect repellent is recommended in areas where sand flies are present.

Road bicycle racing

Road bicycle racing is a sport where people race on bicycle along paved roads. Usually riders start the race at the same time. The winner is the first to the finish line at the end of the route.
Road bicycle racing is popular in Belgium, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. More recently, countries such as Kazakhstan, Australia, Venezuela, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Poland and the United States have also become very good at racing.
Road bicycle racing began as a sport in 1868. The first world championship was in 1893. Cycling has been part of the Olympic Games since 1896.
At the beginning the sport was popular in France, Spain, Belgium, and Italy. Some of the first races were Liège–Bastogne–Liège (started in 1892), Paris-Roubaix (1896), the Tour de France (1903), the Milan – San Remo and Giro di Lombardia (1905), the Giro d'Italia (1909) and the Tour of Flanders (1913). Nowadays there are many other races, but these historic races remain the most famous and many cyclists want to win them.
Single day races are held on one day. The race can be any distance from a few kilometres to over 200km. The race route may go from one place to another, or be a number of laps of a circuit. Some routes take the riders from a starting place and then finish with several laps of a circuit. This helps create excitement for the crowd at the finish.
An individual time trial is an event in which cyclists race alone against the clock. A team time trial is where teams of cyclists race against the clock. In both types of time trial, each cyclist or team starts the race at different times so that each start is fair and equal. The winner is the cyclist or team who finishes the race in the fastest time. Race distances vary from a few km to 60 and rarely more than 100 km.
Stage races are made up of races held for several days in a row. These races are called stages. The competitor with the lowest total time to finish all the stages is the overall winner. He or she is called the general classification (GC) winner. Stage races often have other awards, such as prizes for each stage winners, the points classification winner, and the "King of the Mountains" winner. Some stage races include time trials or team time trials. The stage winner is the first person to cross the finish line that day or the time trial rider (or team) with the lowest time on the course.
These races are very long single stage events. They usually last several days. The winner is the first one to cross the finish line. The riders take breaks on their own schedules. One of the best-known ultramarathons is the Race Across America (RAAM). It is a coast-to-coast non-stop, single-stage race. Riders cover approximately 3,000 miles in about a week.
The winner of the race is the first rider to cross the finish line. However many riders are grouped together in teams. Teams usually have commercial sponsors and are named after the main sponsor. For example some famous teams have been called T-Mobile, Rabobank, ONCE, and Lampre. There can be up to twelve team members in professional races. Team riders decide which team member has the best chance of winning the race. The choice will depend on how hilly the route is, the chance that everyone will finish together in a sprint, and other things. The rest of the team will work to help him or her win the race.
In professional races, radios are used so that the team can talk to each other and the team director. The team director often travels in a team car behind the race to monitor the whole race. The influence of radios on race tactics is controversial, and some people think radios have led to less exciting racing. In September 2009, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the governing body of pro cycling, voted to ban team radios in men's top level road racing.
Different cyclists have different strengths and weaknesses. Therefore a rider may prefer different events over particular courses, and perform different roles within a team.
The main types of rider in road bicycle racing are:
A number of tactics are used to win a race. Tactics can be different in single stage races and stage races.
Tactics are based on drafting. This is where a rider can reduce the effort needed to pedal by following the rider in front very closely. Riding with others in the main field, called the peloton, can save as much as 40% of the energy needed to ride alone. Riders can help each other to ride at high speed, or one rider can sit on a competitor's wheel, forcing him to do more work and get tired earlier. Some teams have a leader, and the rest of the team let him or her draft them to save their energy for the important bit of the race. Drafting is not allowed in individual time trials.
A small group of riders sometimes "breaks away" in front of the main group. When they work together a small group can sometimes go faster than the peloton, if the peloton does not organise to chase them. The riders in the breakaway try to win the race, and in the breakaway there are fewer rivals for the win.
If a break does not succeed and the peloton catches up with them, a sprinter will usually win the race by sprinting faster than everyone else in the final few hundred metres. The team works together to make sure their sprinter is in a good position to win.
Climbs are very good places for a single rider to try and leave the others behind. If the finish of the race is at the top of the climb, or not far past the top, a single rider can stay in front of the peloton and win the race.
In a stage race each day's stage is like a race within the bigger race. Each stage has a winner, either the first rider across the line, or in a time trial the rider or team with the quickest time. After each stage the general classification ranking is also worked out. The rider with the lowest total time for all the stages is the leader. The leader wears a special jersey for the next day's stage. 
In multi-stage races, the GC leader will watch break-aways carefully if there is a rider close to him in the general classification. However often the GC leader will not react to a break-away. This happens if the escaping riders are a long way behind in the GC, and do not have a chance of taking the GC lead. Riders who are far behind often escapes because they want to win the stage or collect points for sprinting or climbing mountains. Riders may also go in a break-away to get television time for their team sponsors because the break-away often gets shown on the television coverage.
The most famous cycling race is the Tour de France, a stage race lasting three weeks. It takes place mostly in France, usually ending in Paris. Similar races are held in Italy (the Giro d'Italia) and Spain (the Vuelta a España). These three races make up the "grand tours".
Professional racing is controlled by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). In 2005 it started the UCI World Tour. The World Tour includes the Grand Tours and other large stage races such as Tour Down Under, Tour de Suisse, Paris–Nice and the Critérium de Dauphiné Libéré.
Some one day races are also part of the World Tour: Milan – San Remo (Italy), Tour of Flanders (Belgium), Paris-Roubaix (France), Liège–Bastogne–Liège (Belgium) and Amstel Gold Race (Netherlands) in the spring, and Clásica de San Sebastián (Spain), HEW Cyclassics (Germany), Züri-Metzgete (Switzerland), Paris–Tours (France) and Giro di Lombardia (Italy) in the autumn season.
Cycling has been at the Olympics since 1896. There are usually road race and individual time trial events for both men and women.
The other important one-day race is the World Championships. The World Championships is held on a different course each year and ridden by national rather than sponsored teams. The winner wears a white jersey with coloured bands (often called "rainbow bands") around the chest.
In Europe and in the United States, cycle racing on the road is a summer sport. The season can start in early spring and end in autumn.

<doc id="439371" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=439371" title="G.K. Dhas">
G.K. Dhas

G.K.Dhas is the Founder of the Mother Teresa Charitable Trust (MTCT). Inspired by the large gathering at the funeral service of St Mother Teresaon 5September 1997 in Calcutta, Dr. G.K. Dhas, who was standing amidst the crowd, was sparked with a nagging question “What have I done for my people as a citizen of India?” This in course of time gave birth to this esteemed social organization.His words and deeds reflect the dedicative service of St Mother Teresa in all the endeavors possible. Through his sacrificial service and indefatigable hard work for the betterment of the society, especially the marginalized and the downtrodden,he soon emerged as a distinguished social reformist. He strives hard to transcend the society into a positive one following the footsteps of Mother Teresa,the resplendent star of hope. The vision and mission of the MTCT is to spread the values and principles of St Mother Teresa.
‘Politics is one of the important means through which the society can be empowered.’ With this great vision, G.K.Dhas got involved in politics with a great zeal and zest. He is at present the General Secretary of the Tamil Nadu Unit of Indian National Congress . “Responsibility of a citizen lies in service to the society” is the motto of this great visionary who works determinedly for the betterment of the poor.
He was born on 11 March 1951 in Melmidalam, a small hamlet in Kanyakumari District, Tamil Nadu, India. He had his schooling in the village itself. His father, G.KanagappuNadar,was an agriculturalist and mother, G.Chellammal, was a home-maker. They nurtured him with righteousness and wisdom. Indeed, they were his first role models. He has got four siblings, two brothers and two sisters. His wife B.Stella, a teacher and his daughter Binuja and Pravin both B.E, MBA, are professionals. He secured B.A. at Christian College, Martandam and pursued M.A. in English Literature at Sagar University, Madhya Pradesh and eventually completed BAL (Law Degree) at Annamalai University.
After completing his post graduation, he joined a govt. Organization in Chennai and worked in various fields like marketing, public distribution, etc. He was appointed as the procurement officer in 1983 with a promise of good salary. But, he quitted the post immediately on account of the prevailing corruption in the department. He took good many initiatives, desiring to serve the broken humanity; amidst them one such was the foundation of two NIDHI companies. He started them with the help of his friends. Furthermore, the two companies still function and serve people; one is in Kanyakumari and the other one is in Chennai
Inspired by the lifestyle of K.Kamaraj, an exemplary Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu,G.K.Dhas, being a student then, with so much eager and enthusiasm, joined the Congress Party and vigorously engaged himself in the election campaign of K.Kamaraj in 1969 as well as in 1971 parliament election. He occupied the district level position in the Students’ Congress.
He was appointed as the state committee member in the minority wing of the Congress Party in 1975. Taken aback by the message proclaimed by late V.P.Singh to eradicate corruption from politics, he joined ‘Jan Morcha’ and became the Tamil Nadu State General Secretary in 1986. When Jan Morcha merged with Janatadal, he was declared one of the State Executive members. Later, he was appointed as the Secretary and afterwards, as the General Secretary. When Janatadal was divided into Janatadal (Secular) and Janatadal (United), he opted to the Secular Party. He has been nominated as the Secretary General of Janatadal (Secular) Party in Tamil Nadu. He is an effective communicator, polyglot and good writer. He has translated the speeches of national leaders like V.P.Singh, I.K.Gujaral, Shri.H.D.DevaGowda, RamvilasPaswan.
When there was communal violence in Gujarat in 2002 in which hundreds of innocent lives were massacred, he, along with a few senior leaders, resolved to strengthen the secular forces in the country for fighting against communal forces led by the BJP party. He in course of time realized that the policies of the Congress leader Smt.Sonia Gandhi alone can overcome the communal forces to maintain the secular credentials of the country; the Janatadal (secular) unit of Tamil Nadu under the leadership of the veteran leader Shri. G.A, Vadivelu, merged into the Congress Party during a rally at Chennai 2002. Then, he became the Tamil Nadu State General Secretary of the Congress Party in 2002. In the reshuffle in 2013, again he was nominated as General Secretary by the National President Smt. Sonia Gandhi and the Vice – President Shri. Rahul Gandhi.
He has been nominated in the following committees
He is the Founder of" 
Nobel Laureate Mother Teresa Charitable Trust (MTCT) 
Being an ardent follower of Mother Teresa, he desires to proclaim her values and ideologies to the humanity in order that the people from all walks of life may be inspired to become instruments of peace and the world may be replete with love, harmony and serenity.
Mother Teresa Forum and Mother Teresa Students Forum enroll members from all strata of the society and form committees to render service to the under privileged and the needy in the society. It identifies the richest of the rich and the poorest of the poor in the society in order to make the former help the latter so that the gap of inequality may be cemented with the bridge of SHARING. It invites young and energetic people, irrespective of caste, religion, politics, gender, state and nation, to dedicate their service to the people.
MTCT runs free ambulance service, free computer centers, free tailoring centers, free tuition centers in various parts of the country. All these services are offered as part of the mission initiated by G.K. Dhas. 
He is the Editor and Publisher of “Mother News” a bilingual- monthly journal which tries to re engineer and transcend the society into a positive one. Well-experienced personalities such as scientists, IAS/IPS officers, legal luminaries, social activists etc. contribute articles to this journal. The articles are informative, society- oriented and reflective. It covers subjects other than politics, cinema, religion, caste or community. Every month more than ten thousand copies are dispatched to different parts of the world. It shapes the young generation to become writers.
The international Tamil University, United States of America has conferred a doctorate degree on him for his exemplary services to humanity through Mother Teresa Charitable Trust.
He is a man of hard work. His indefatigable hard work has mitigated the suffering of many people. Yet, he is humble and simple. His service to the humanity is magnificent. He has sacrificed his entire life for the poor and the marginalized. And, he still serves them with the same burning desire. His heart is always vibrating with many dreams- the dreams that will give hope to the hopeless, freedom to the poor from the shackles of poverty, freedom from the bondage of corruption, etc. Thinking of him, it always reminds me of Robert Frost’s words
"“Two roads diverged in a yellow wood"
"I chose the less travelled and"
"that made all the difference."”

The Polyphaga is the largest and most diverse suborder of beetles. The name is got from two Greek words: "poly"-, meaning 'many', and "phagein", meaning 'to eat', so the suborder is called the “eaters of many things”. Polyphaga has 144 families in 16 superfamilies, and shows an enormous variety of specialization and adaptation. It has over 315,000 described species, about 90% of all beetle species so far discovered. 
There are 5 infraorders:
The infraorder Cucujiformia includes most phytophagous [plant-eating] beetles. Adoption of a plant-eating lifestyle promoted speciation and diversity in beetles, with Cucujiformia, especially weevils, forming a major radiation. Much of this adaptive radiation has taken place at the same time as the evolution of the flowering plants. "99% of phytophagous beetles feed on flowering plants".

Prince of Carignan

The title of Prince of Carignan is the French form of the Italian title of "Prince of Carignano". The title is more often than not seen in its French form due to the many ties the Carignans had with French royalty and the minor nobility The title stems from a younger son of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy. Due to their links with the former Ducal family of Savoy the Prince was entitled to the highest rank at the Savoyard court and should the ruling Duke die without heirs the Prince was entitled to succeed to the Ducal throne. The Princes had a Palace in Turin called the "Palazzo Carignano". The title is similar to that of Prince of Condé in France.
It was a junior line of the House of Savoy. It was founded by Prince Thomas Francis of Savoy, Prince di Carignano 21 December 1596 - 22 January 1656), an Italian military commander. His descendants were accepted as "princes strangers" (Foreign Princes) at the court of France, where some held prominent positions, eventually coming to reign as kings of Sardinia from 1831 to 1861 and as kings of Italy from 1861 until the dynasty's deposition in 1946. The Carignanos also, briefly, supplied a king each to Spain and to Croatia, as well as queens consort to Bulgaria and Portugal.
Following the succession of Charles Albert to the throne the title was not used again the family preferring to use other titles named after Italian cities. The famous Princess Marie Louise of Savoy ("princesse de Lamballe") was a Savoyard princess of this line. 
Sometimes the style of "Highness" was used but at the Savoyard and French courts the style of "Serene Highness" was more often than not used

Knights of Labor

The Knights of Labor (K of L) was the largest and one of the most important American labor organizations of the 1880s. One of its first leaders was Terence V. Powderly. The Knights started as a secret society with many elaborate rituals. By 1878 they became more of an open group. They greatly expanded their membership in the 1880s.
The Knights of Labor began during the era of labor unions. The Garment Cutters Association of Philadelphia failed and was dissolved on 9 December 1869. Several members voted to form a new organization. They were convinced their new union needed more secrecy. As they drew up plans for the new organization each member was required to take an oath of secrecy. The title for the presiding officer was "Master Worker" and other titles were similarly named. On December 28th they adopted the name of Knights of Labor. The membership fees were $1. In 1878 they held their first general meeting. The early Knights took up campaigning for an 8-hour workday. Child labor exploitation was another of their causes. About 20% of the Knights were women and black workers. The members were mainly working class people. Certain professions were banned from membership. This included lawyers, bankers, and stockbrokers. As a measure of how these occupations were viewed, saloon keepers and gamblers were also excluded. 
Workers in the 1880s began going on strike to gain better . Only about half belonged to unions. There were an average of about 500 strikes a year between 1881 and 1885. In 1886 this increased to over 1400 strikes. On 4 May 1886 in Chicago a peaceful rally was held to support workers striking for an eight-hour day. Someone threw a bomb into the crowd at Haymarket square. At least eight police officers and several civilians were killed. Labor unions were blamed even though the person throwing the bomb was never caught. The press and the American people held labor unions responsible. As one of the largest labor organizations the knights of Labor were blamed more than the other unions. The Haymarket affair caused the decline of the Knights of Labor even though they were not directly involved. By the early 1900s they were all but gone.

Pope Victor I

Pope Victor (189-198C.E.) I was the fourteenth Pope, the official title is Bishop of Rome of the Catholic Church.
Pope Victor was the first African pope. He attempted to resolve the ongoing controversy over the celebration of Easter through a great meeting of church members from Rome and Gaul (France) and areas of and around Mesopotamia (Iraq) that Easter should be celebrated on a Sunday instead of on Passover, whichever that day occurred on. The Asia Minor church however, stayed fast to the celebration on Passover. Pope Victor at first declared the congregation in Asia Minor excommunicated but under protest seems to have withdrawn and those members of the church were accepted back into the Church.
He secured the release of some Christians who were condemned to the mines of Sardinia as a result of his request with the emperor's mistress.
His feast day is celebrated on July 28.

National War Labor Board

The National War Labor Board (NWLB) was an agency of the United States government. It was created in early 1918 by President Woodrow Wilson. It was made up of twelve members from business and labor. The were former President William Howard Taft and attorney Frank Walsh. Its purpose was to make sure labor strikes did not hurt the war effort. The board ended after the war in May 1919. The National War Labor Board was reestablished on January 12, 1942 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The chairman was William Hammatt Davis. This board ended its duties in 1945.
The United States entered World War I in April 1917. Soon the government became concerned that labor strikes might stop the production of military equipment and supplies. In response President Woodrow Wilson created the National War Labor Board. The board recognized the worker's right to organize unions and bargain collectively. Former President Taft and labor attorney Frank Walsh were the co-chairmen. The board had little real power but depended on their ability to negotiate compromises between the two sides. They succeeded in preventing a number of strikes. After Germany was defeated the board was disbanded. In 1919 several strikes broke out in the coal and steel industries. The board supported an eight-hour day for workers and equal pay for equal work regardless of sex.
The National War Labor Board was started up again by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, on January 12, 1942. The chairman was William Hammatt Davis. The board's job was to prevent labor disputes. Also to insure that higher wage settlements did not cause inflation. The board was generally favorable to unions. The board encouraged the use of fringe benefits instead of inflation-causing higher wages. In 1942 the board began a "maintenance of membership" policy which attracted new members into labor unions. Unions understood they had to minimize any activism among their members in order to gain favorable rulings from the NWLB. Dispite the efforts of labor unions there were wartime strikes. Most of these were unauthorized (by the unions) or wildcat strikes (non-union). The CIO (Congress of Industrial Organizations), later part of the AFL-CIO, largely cooperated with the board. When the number of strikes peaked in 1944 CIO members maintained their no-strike pledge. By the time the war ended, membership in the CIO was nearly 5 million. The NWLB provided on an honorary basis, that is, without fees. But they encouraged paid arbitrators and by war's end most who arbitrated disputes were paid a fee of from $25–$100 per day. In 1945 the board was disbanded. A wave of strikes broke out just the same as when the NWLB ended in 1918.

Cementation

Cementation is what makes rocks solid. It is the process where grains of sediment get stuck together. It is a chemical process, and the cement is a precipitate which crystallises in the spaces between the matrix of grains. Silica (SiO) and calcium carbonate (CaCO) are the most common types of cement.
Ions carried in groundwater precipitate to form new crystalline material in sediment pores: this is how "sediment" becomes "rock". The new pore-filling minerals form "bridges" between original sediment grains, thereby binding them together. So "sand" becomes "sandstone", and "gravel" becomes "conglomerate". 
Cementation occurs mainly below the water table. Large volumes of pore water must pass through sediment pores for new mineral cements to crystallize and so millions of years are generally required to complete the cementation process. 
Sedimentation does not always occur. Many quarries used for sand and gravel have them as loose particles and stones, just as if they came from a present-day beach. In England, most of these quarries are from beds laid down in the Jurassic, 150+ million years ago. By chance, the conditions for cementation have never occurred there.

Suicide in Greenland

Suicide is a serious problem in Greenland. According to the government of Greenland, one person in five has attempted suicide. Because of this, the Greenland government has taken a number of steps to reduce the suicide rate. One example is roadside posters.
The number of suicides in Greenland began to rise in the 1970s. Before that it had been very low. It kept getting higher until 1986. In 1986, suicide was the leading cause of death in several towns, such as Sarfannguit. Before 1970, the rate of suicide in Greenland had been very low. But by 1994, it had become one of the highest in the world. The rate was 107 per 100,000 persons committing suicide per year. Government data in 2010 suggested that almost one suicide occurred a week.
An article was published in the journal "BMC Psychiatry" in 2009. It reported that 1351 suicides took place in Greenland during the 35 years (1968–2002). The study noted seasonal changes in the suicide rate. Suicides were higher in June and lower in the winter months. Suicide rates in northern parts of West Greenland are higher than in southern parts. Suicide rates are higher for men than women. Most of the people committing suicide are young men between the ages of 15-24. Unlike in other Western countries, the suicide rate in Greenland goes down with age.
Several reasons are blamed for Greenland's high rate of suicide. These including alcoholism, depression, poverty, poor relationships with partners and dysfunctional parental homes. The higher summer suicide rate is blamed on insomnia caused by longer periods of daylight.
The increase in suicide rates started about the time television appeared in Greenland. But it may be more the "modernization package" in general that is causing the problem. Culture clash between the traditional culture and modern Western culture is also assumed to be a factor.
The most common methods were hanging (46%) and shooting (37%). Other methods include jumping from heights, cutting with sharp objects, drowning, overdose of medication, and poisoning.
Greenland's Government and other organizations have made a number of efforts to prevent suicides. There are different associations that provide support for people that feel suicidal. Measures include posters placed along the roads, which read: "The call is free. No one is alone. Don't be alone with your dark thoughts. Call." Suicide consultants are used to show films discouraging teenage suicide attempts.

Fuze

In military munitions, a fuze is the part of an explosive device that makes it explode. In some devices (notably torpedoes) a fuze may be identified by function as the "exploder". The term "fuze" is used to indicate an advanced device with mechanical and/or electronic parts.
Time fuzes detonate after a set period of time. Impact, or contact fuzes detonate when they hit something, usually the target. A proximity fuze uses sensors which can be one or more combinations of the following: radar, active sonar, passive acoustic, infrared, magnetic, photoelectric, seismic or even television cameras. Whatever the sensor used, percussion fuzes cause the explosion to occur close to the target. The target will either be destroyed or severely damaged.
Most English-language countries use the "z" spelling to distinguish between simple burning fuses and pyrotechnical or explosive devices.

Megan's Law

Megan's Law is an informal name for laws in the United States that require law enforcement authorities to make information available to the public regarding registered . It was created after the murder of Megan Kanka. Individual states decide what information will be made available and how it should be distributed. Most give out the offender's name, picture, address, Prison date, and nature of the crime. The information is often displayed on free public websites, but can be published in newspapers, distributed in pamphlets, or through various other means.
Richard and Maurine Kanka and their three children lived in a small town in New Jersey. On 29 July 1994 their daughter Megan was lured into a neighbor's house to see a non-existent puppy. There she was raped and murdered by her , Jesse Timmendequas. Timmendequas had just recently been released from prison after his second conviction on sexual offenses against children. He had served six of the ten years of his sentence. Searches for the girl turned up nothing. The local police quickly focused on three known sex offenders living across the street from the missing girl. Police released two of the suspects when they verified where they were. Timmendequas became the main suspect. He was released after several hours of . After obtaining a detectives searched Timmendequas's trash and found a piece of Megan Kanka's clothing. Timmendequas was questioned again and after several hours told police "She's in the park." When police then asked if she was still alive Timmendequas said "No, she's dead. I put a over her head."
The Kankas were outraged to find they were living across the street from a convicted child sex offender. Two days after her murder, the parents of Megan Kanka started the "Megan Nichole Kanka Foundation". The mission of the foundation is to identify the location of convicted child sex offenders in every community. 
Maurine Kanka began pushing for laws disclosing the need to notify residents of the presence of convicted sex offenders in their communities. New Jersey was the first state to pass a "Megan's law." In 1995 the Supreme Court of New Jersey upheld the State law. The continuing efforts resulted in President Bill Clinton signing the federal version of "Megan's Law." The Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children Law, or "Megan's Law", was signed in May 1996. This was the first part. The second, or notification part of the law, was signed on 13 November 1996. It gave states one year to pass state versions of Megan's law. The District of Columbia and forty-seven states met the deadline and passed their own versions of the law. The notification portion of the law requires states to make public information about all sex offenders. They may each choose how they want to implement that part. Under the law sex offenders are grouped in risk bands based on the nature and details of their offense. The public is not notified of 'low risk' sexual offenders. Information on 'Medium risk' offenders is disclosed to schools and . 'High risk' sexual offenders' information is disclosed to the public. 
Megan's law is not without problems. As many as 20% of offenders have disappeared after providing false addresses. Others make sure to offend outside their own neighborhoods where they are not readily identified. Some states release information on offenders only if officials there decide it is necessary. While many states are open and disclose offender information readily, some are very restrictive as to who the information is released to. Many offender databases are inaccurate and often mistake one person for another. s can make sex offense charges go away when negotiating with prosecutors. They sometimes get 'pled down' to lesser offenses.

Flipping

Flipping is a term used in economics. It is used mainly in the United States to describe buying something and quickly reselling (or "flipping") it for profit. It can apply to any asset but is often applied to real estate and initial public offerings (IPOs).
Real estate is bought and sold every day. The seller arranges for a realtor to advertise and sell their property. The realtor charges between 4 and 7 percent of the selling price as a commission. The sale is conducted between the owner of the property or house, and the who wants to purchase it. 
Flipping is used by real estate investors to describe someone purchasing a property then selling it quickly for a profit. Usually the investor will pay for improvements to make the property more attractive. The investor must have the money to buy the house and pay for the improvements. Realtors neither buy the house or resell it (although a realtor can also be a flipper). They simply broker the sale.
Flipping involves a good deal of risk for investors. They must know the value of a property and not pay too much. They have to be careful not to invest too much in improvements. Very often run-down properties or are sold at auctions. The buyer may not be able to inspect the property before buying it. This can lead to additional costs to fix problems that could not be seen. A property needs to sell quickly or there is no quick return on their money. 
There are also many risks for buyers of flipped homes.
Initial public offerings are when a private company sells shares of stock to the public for the first time (called going public). Flipping is buying stocks and selling within the first 2 to 3 days after the company went public. The hope is the price will go up rapidly. Underwriters want investors want to hold onto stocks. They may blacklist investors who flip too many stocks even though it is legal.
In the United Kingdom the term is used to describe Members of Parliament switching their 'second home' between several houses. This was to maximize their taxpayer funded allowances.

Fasciculation

A fasciculation, or "muscle twitch", is a small, local, involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation. At times it may be visible under the skin. Deeper areas can be detected by EMG testing. A fasciculation can happen in any skeletal muscle in the body. Fasciculations can occur in normal healthy people. One uncommon reason for them is due to a lower motor neuron lesion that may be caused by any of several diseases. One example would be Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

Cephalaspis

Cephalaspis "(head shield)" was a genus of armoured fish in the early Devonian about 400 million years ago (mya).
It was one of the jawless fishes, or ostracoderms, which were common at the time. They were discovered in the first half of the 19th century in the Old Red Sandstone of Britain. "Cepalaspis" was described and pictured in a popular work on the rocks and fossils of the Old Red Sandstone.
It was a medium-sized fish that lived in freshwater streams and estuaries of the early Devonian. Some of the fossils are well-preserved, and so we know quite a bit about its anatomy. Its armour was on the dorsal side, and its mouth on the ventral side. Therefore, it is likely that it was a bottom-feeder, nosing about in the mud of a river. It had a typical vertebrate type of brain, with front, middle and rear regions, and nerves to and from sense organs and muscles in the head region.
Its pineal opening between its eyes was probably a light-sensitive organ. On its skull are three areas which obviously had a special function. Many modern fish which live in muddy rivers use both pressure-sensitive lateral lines, and also electrical fields to sense movement. "Cephalaspis" had no lateral lines, but the three fields on its skull were no doubt sensory, for sensing pressure change or electrical fields.
The animal had semi-circular canals to sense balance (one of the functions of our own semi-circular canals). They were capable of sustained swimming, and short rapid bursts. Almost all the fossils are found in strata laid down in freshwater conditions, so the various species live in rivers, streams connected with lakes and estuaries.

Fair Labor Standards Act

The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (abbreviated as FLSA; also referred to as the Wages and Hours Bill) is a federal of the United States. 
The FLSA introduced a maximum 44-hour workweek (reduced to a 40-hour workweek by 1940). It established a national minimum wage (of 25¢ per hour). It guaranteed "time-and-a-half" for overtime in certain jobs. The FLSA also prohibited most employment of minors in "oppressive child labor". The FLSA created a Wage and Hour Division in the Department of Labor. The statute applies to employees engaged in interstate commerce or employed by a business engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, unless the employer can claim an from these requirements.
The FLSA was originally written in 1932 by Senator Hugo Black. He was later appointed to the Supreme Court in 1937. However, Black's proposal to require employers to adopt a thirty-hour workweek met stiff resistance. In 1938 a revised version of Black's proposal was passed that adopted an eight-hour day and a forty-hour workweek. It allowed workers to earn wages for an extra four hours of overtime as well. According to the act, workers must be paid minimum wage and overtime pay must be one-and-a-half times regular pay. Children under eighteen cannot do certain dangerous jobs. Also children under the age of sixteen cannot work during school hours. There were 700,000 workers affected by the FLSA. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt called it the most important piece of New Deal legislation passed since the Social Security Act of 1935.

Ham earned a Bachelor of Applied Science degree from Queensland Institute of Technology. He also received a diploma in Education from the University of Queensland.
On February 4, 2014, at the Creation Museum, Ham debated Bill Nye (also known as "Bill Nye the Science Guy"). The topic was the question "Is Creation A Viable Model of Origins?". The televised event drew over three million viewers. Ham's position was the world was created about 6,000 years ago. He also defended his position that all animals alive today descend from those aboard Noah's Ark. Nye argued that radioisotopic and ice core data shows that Earth has existed for far longer than 6,000 years. He also added that using the Bible's description of the Ark it could not float. A number of experts were critical of the debate saying that it did not discuss important areas. At least one said neither did very well. An informal viewer's poll showed 92% thought Nye won the debate. However, "Debate is a tool for showing who's a better orator, not necessarily who's right. And Ken Ham is no mean orator, usually," noted the National Center for Science Education, a not-for-profit membership organization that defends the teaching of evolution and climate science."
Ham said of his father:
He married Marilyn "Mally" on 30 December 1972. They have five children together. The Ham couple live in unincorporated Boone County, Kentucky.

Intelligence agency

An intelligence agency is a government agency. Its job is to collect, analyse, and use information to support its government. 
There are two parts to this, and usually they are done by separate agencies. The first part is to collect information (to "spy") on other countries. The other side is to watch people in the home country who might cause problems. A third activity is to defend against foreign intelligence agencies in the home country. This is called counter-intelligence, and is often done by a separate agency.
What the agencies discover is called "intelligence". It may be used to help law enforcement, security, defence and foreign policy. 
The methods of information gathering are sometimes covert (hidden) and sometimes quite open. A covert method might be to steal and copy secret documents. An open method would be to read all published work on some important matter, and analyse it. Much important material is published openly in democratic countries.
To get hold of secret information, these organisations use espionage, intercept signals (tap phones, hack computers), cryptanalysis (break codes), and think about what the information means. Putting together and communicating information is known as intelligence analysis and assessment.
Some agencies have been involved in assassination, arms trafficking, coups d'état, and the placement of misinformation (propaganda) as well as other covert operations, in order to support their own or their governments' interests.
The United States has about 17 major intelligence groups, and many other smaller groups. These are the most important:

Atlantic salmon

The Atlantic salmon, "Salmo salar", is a fish in the family Salmonidae. Atlantic salmon are found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and in rivers that flow into the north Atlantic. They have also been successfully transplanted into the north Pacific Ocean. Other names for Atlantic salmon are: bay salmon, black salmon, caplin-scull salmon, Sebago salmon, silver salmon, fiddler, or outside salmon. Atlantic salmon that don't journey to sea are known as landlocked salmon or . This can be due to human interference or natural disasters.
Most Atlantic salmon follow an life cycle. Once hatched, they are called alevins. They live off the nutrients in their they were born with. Once they start feeding they are called fry. They grow into juveniles or parr and remain in fresh water for a number of years while growing. When they leave fresh water they are called smolts. Smolts leave the streams and move into the ocean for feeding and growth. The post-smolts change from territorial behavior to that of open ocean, possibly shoaling, fish. Their mortality rate while in the ocean is very high. The rate is from 90% to as high as 99%. After 1–5 years at sea they return to spawn in the same streams they were born in. Unlike most Pacific varieties Atlantic salmon are meaning they don't automatically die after their first spawning. But the stress of spawning, predators, or disease does kill many. The remainder return to sea to spawn again and again.
There is a variety in the life cycle of Atlantic salmon. They do not require salt water. Numerous examples of fully fresh water landlocked Atlantic salmon exist throughout the Northern Hemisphere. In North America, the landlocked fish are called ouananiche. Fresh water Atlantic salmon are smaller than the (ocean-dwelling) Atlantic salmon.

Bark bread

Bark bread is a form of bread used during a famine. It made by adding ground phloem to the flour as an to make it last longer.
During the 18th and early 19th century Northern Europe had several very bad years of crop failure. This was particularly during the Little Ice Age of the mid 18th century. The grain harvest was badly affected. Many ideas to make the flour last longer were introduced. In 1742, samples of “emergency bread” were sent from Kristiansand, Norway to the Royal Administration in Copenhagen. One of these was bark bread. This is bread made from grain and bread made from burned bones. During the Napoleonic Wars, moss too was used for food.
The last time bark bread was used as famine food in Norway was during the Napoleonic Wars. The introduction of the potato as a staple crop gave the farmers other crops when grain production failed. So that bark bread and moss cakes were no longer needed. In Northern Sweden, traces of Sami harvest of bark from Scots pine are known from the 1890s. In Finland "pettuleipä" (literally "pinewood-bark bread") was produced as a substitute for bread during the Finnish Civil War of 1918.

Luby's massacre

The Luby's massacre was a mass murder on October 16, 1991, which took place at a Luby's restaurant in Killeen, Texas.
George Hennard, a thirty-five year old man, drove his blue 1987 Ford Ranger pickup truck through the front window of a Luby's restaurant. He yelled "This is what Bell County did to me!" and started shooting customers and staff members with a Glock 17 and a Ruger P89. He shot and killed 23 people, ten of them with a single shot to the head. He also wounded 20 other people. Hennard had a dislike of women and survivors of the shooting said that he went by men to shoot the women. He also announced that "All women of Killeen and Belton are vipers!" He exchanged gunfire with police officers, hid in a bathroom and committed suicide.
One of the survivors of the massacre was former Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives Suzanna Hupp. Both her parent were killed in the shooting.
Until the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, it was the deadliest shooting rampage in American history. It is now the third deadliest behind Virginia Tech and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. It is still the deadliest non-school shooting rampage in American history.
After the massacre, the Texas Legislature passed a shall-issue gun law in 1995, which required all qualifying applicants be issued a Concealed Handgun License (which is Texas' required permit to carry concealed weapons). To qualify for a license, the person must be free-and-clear of crimes, attend a minimum 10-hour class which is taught by a state-certified instructor, pass a 50-question test, show a high amount of skill in a 50-round shooting test, and must pass two background tests, one shallow and one deep. The license costs $140 for a four year license and applicants have to pay $10 for fingerprinting as well as instructor costs which vary. The law was campaigned by shooting survivor Suzanna Hupp and was signed by then-Governor George W. Bush.
The restaurant closed down on September 9, 2000. A Chinese-American buffet called Yank Sing is now located where the Luby's used to be.

<doc id="440762" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=440762" title="Long-term memory">
Long-term memory

Long-term memory (LTM) is our memory of past events. It follows from short-term memory, and involves the growth of nerve synapses which are very long-lasting.
The brain does not store memories in one unified structure, as might be seen in a computer's hard disk drive. Instead, different types of memory are stored in different regions of the brain. Long term memory is typically divided up into two major headings: explicit memory and implicit memory.
Explicit or 'declarative' memory refers to memories which can be consciously recalled such as facts and knowledge. These are partly encoded by the hippocampus, stored elsewhere. Exactly where is unknown, but the temporal cortex has been proposed as a likely candidate. Research shows that amnesiac patients with damage to the medial temporal lobe performed more poorly on explicit learning tests than did healthy controls. However, the same patients performed at the same rate as healthy controls on "implicit" learning tests. This implies that the medial temporal lobe is heavily involved in explicit learning, but not in implicit learning. 
Implicit or procedural memory refers to the use of objects or movements of the body, such as how exactly to use a pencil, drive a car, or ride a bicycle. This type of memory is encoded and it is presumed stored by the striatum and other parts of the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia is believed to mediate procedural memory and other brain structures and is largely independent of the hippocampus. The parietal and occipital regions are associated with implicit memory.
The memory for events that evoke a particularly strong emotion may involve both declarative and procedural memory processes. Emotional memories are consciously available, but elicit a powerful, unconscious physiological reaction. Research indicates that the amygdala is extremely active during emotional situations, and acts with the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in the encoding and consolidation of emotional events.
Working memory (STM) is not part of long term memory, but is important for long term memory to work. Working memory holds and works on information for a short period before it is either forgotten or put into long term memory. Then, to remember something from long term memory, it must come back into working memory. If working memory is overloaded it can affect the encoding of long term memory.

Sensory memory

Sensory memory (SM) is an automatic response, not under conscious control. It deals with the input from the senses. The information people received which is stored in sensory memory is just long enough to be transferred to short-term memory.
The information in SM is the "raw data" of a person's overall sensory experience. There are four common features to all forms of SM: 
The SM is made up of stores of different kinds of information. Each has different rates of information processing and decay. Genetics also plays a role in SM capacity.

Between 2012 and 2013, more than 27,000 volunteers (people who are not paid money) worked to make the parks for better for the 25.2 million people who visit every year. There is a small fee to enter most of Florida's state parks. It costs more to use , marinas, or campsites if the park has them. Florida's state parks together have 3,454 family campsites, 235 cabins, thousands of picnic tables, of beaches, and over 1,625 miles (2,616 km) of trails.
The Florida Park Service is the part of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. They operate the Florida State Parks. The National Recreation and Park Association gave them the Gold Medal honoring the best state park system in the country in 1999 and 2005. The parks are open all year. Some have many things to do other than fishing, hiking and camping. Many parks have facilities for bird watching or horseback riding; there are several battle reenactments; and freshwater (not salty) springs and beaches are some of Florida's very beautiful places.
Several state parks used to be private tourist attractions bought by the state of Florida to preserve (keep from changing) their natural environment. These parks include the Silver River State Park, Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park, Rainbow Springs State Park and Weeki Wachee Springs.
There are state parks in 58 of Florida's 67 counties. Nine of the 161 parks do not have "State Park" in their name. Four are "conservation areas" (reserve, preserve, or wildlife refuge); three are "Historical/Archaeological sites"; one is a fishing pier and one is a recreation area. Seven parks are mostly undeveloped (nothing built there) with few or no facilities (such as water or toilets); 10 parks are accessible only by private boat or ferry; and 13 parks contain National Natural Landmarks. There are also eleven national parks in Florida. The National Park Service controls those.

Holocene calendar

The Holocene calendar, also called the Holocene Era Human era or (HE), is a year numbering system that adds 10,000 years to the currently used "Anno Domini" (AD) or Common Era (CE) system. It places the first year near the beginning of the Holocene epoch and the Neolithic revolution. People who like the Human Era system say that it makes for easier geological, archaeological, dendrochronological and historical dating. They say that it is based on an event more important than the birth of Jesus. The current year of AD can be made into a Holocene year by adding the number "1" before it, making it 1 HE. The "Human Era" was first thought of by the scientist Cesare Emiliani in 1993 (11993 HE).
Cesare Emiliani's reasons for wanting a new calendar include:
Instead, HE places its epoch to 10,000 BC. This is a rough approximation of the start of the current geologic epoch, the Holocene (the name means "entirely recent"). The reason for this is that human civilization (e.g., the first settlements, agriculture, etc.) is believed to have started within this time. All important dates in human history can then be listed using a simple increasing date scale with smaller dates always before larger dates.
Conversion to the Human Era from Julian or Gregorian AD years can be achieved by adding 10,000. BC years are converted by subtracting the BC year from 10,001.
A useful check is that the last single number of BC and HE equivalent pairs must add up to 1 or 11.

Kinematics

Kinematics is the branch of classical mechanics which describes the motion of points, bodies (objects) and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without looking at the cause of this motion. The term was translated from French; A.M. Ampère used the term "cinématique". He constructed the term form the Greek , kinema (movement, motion), derived from , kinein (to move). The study of "kinematics" is often referred to as the "geometry of motion."
To describe motion, kinematics studies the paths of points, lines and other geometric objects in space, and some of their properties such as velocity and acceleration. Astrophysics uses kinematics to describe the motion of celestial bodies and systems. Mechanical engineering, robotics and biomechanics use it to describe the motion of systems composed of joined parts such as an engine, a robotic arm or the skeleton of the human body.
The study of kinematics can be abstracted into purely mathematical functions. It is possible to represent rotation with elements of the unit circle in the complex plane. Other planar algebras are used to represent the shear mapping of classical motion in absolute time and space and to represent the Lorentz transformations of relativistic space and time. Mathematicians have developed a science of kinematic geometry, which uses time as a parameter.
Certain geometric transformations which are called rigid transformations have been developed to describe the movement of components of a mechanical system. These transformations simplify the derivation of its equations of motion, and is central to dynamic analysis.
Kinematic analysis is the process of measuring the kinematic quantities used to describe motion. In engineering, kinematic analysis may be used to find the range of movement for a given mechanism, and, working in reverse, kinematic synthesis designs a mechanism for a desired range of motion. In addition, "kinematics" applies algebraic geometry to the study of the mechanical advantage of a mechanical system, or mechanism.

System of measurement

A system of measurement is a set of related measures that are used to give a numeric value to something. A "system of measurement" is also known as a "metric". There are many systems of measurement. Some systems of measurement describe physical systems. Other systems of measurement describe economic systems.
The term "system of measurement" is often used in engineering application to describe a set of operational devices that take measurements. 
In metrology, the term "system of measurement" is often used as a synonym for system of units.
The international standard system is the International System of Units. Other systems in common use are the closely related United States customary units and British imperial units. 
A system of measurement that describes economic systems is called an econometric system. An econometric system uses quantities such as Gross domestic product and money supply to model an economic system.

Ricin

Ricin is a poison. It is a highly toxic, naturally occurring protein. It is produced in the seeds of the castor oil plant "Ricinus communis". 
A dose the size of a few grains of table salt can kill an adult human. The median lethal dose (LD) of ricin is around 22 micrograms per kilogram (1.78 mg for an average adult, around of a standard aspirin tablet/0.4 g gross) in humans if injected or inhaled. Oral exposure to ricin is far less toxic and a lethal dose can be up to 30–40 milligrams per kilogram.
Ricin prevents cells from assembling various amino acids into proteins, and death occurs after a few hours up to a day. Ricin has been used as a terrorist weapon, including the assassination of Georgi Markov in 1978, supposedly by the KGB.

China Airlines Flight 611

China Airlines Flight 611 was a scheduled international passenger flight from Taipei to Hong Kong, China. On May 25, 2002, the Boeing 747-209B airplane broke apart while flying over the Taiwan Straits and crashed into the water. It happened about 25 minutes after takeoff. The accident was caused by metal fatigue in the rear part of the plane. This was traced back to an incorrect repair that was done 22 years before the accident. All 225 people on board the plane were killed.
The Boeing 747-209B that flew China Airlines Flight 611 was registered as B-1866. This was changed to B-18255 on May 18, 1999. The plane was delivered to China Airlines on July 31, 1979. It was powered by 4 Pratt & Whitney JT9D engines. At time of crash it had flown for 64,394 hours, taking off and landing 21,180 times.
On February 7, 1980 the tail of the plane struck the runway while landing at Hong Kong airport. The plane was then ferried back to Taipei. A temporary repair was done on February 8, 1980, while a permanent repair was done from May 23 to 26, 1980. Later it was discovered the repair was not done to Boeing repair standards. It was also discovered that from 1997 a total of 29 corrosion inspections were not completed. When the repair patch was recovered from the crash site, there was evidence that deep scratches had been polished out, thinning the metal. Several fatigue cracks were found in the scratches. Crash estimate a crack of about 71 inches may have caused the plane to break up.
The captain was Yi Ching-Fung (In Traditional Chinese, 易清豐), who was 51 years old. He joined China Airlines in 1991 before becoming a captain in 1997. He had flown for 10148 hours. First Officer Hsieh Ya Shiung (In Traditional Chinese, 謝亞雄), who was 52 years old, joined China Airlines in 1990. He had flown for a total of 10173 hours.
As the Boeing 747-200B was an older type of airplane, a flight engineer is needed. The flight engineer on this flight is Sen Kuo Chao (In Traditional Chinese, 趙盛國). He joined China Airlines in 1977 and had a total flying time of 19117 hours.
All three pilots had more than 24 hours of rest before this flight.
On the flight to Hong Kong, there were 190 Taiwanese passengers. Of the rest 16, 9 were from People's Republic Of China and 5 were from Hong Kong. There were also 1 Singaporean and 1 Swiss.
All 19 crew came from Taiwan.
On May 25, 2002, B-18255 was actually going to be sold to Orient Thai Airlines. This was the plane's last day of service with China Airlines. Takeoff was at 3.07 pm, and the plane was cleared to climb to 20,000 feet. At 3.16 pm the plane was again cleared to climb and maintain 35,000 feet. At about 3.30 pm, the plane was about to reach 35,000 feet when it suddenly disappeared from the radar systems of the air traffic controllers. Communications were also lost. No distress signals were sent out. However, two Cathay Pacific planes nearby received flight 611's emergency location-indicator signals.
Later, the investigators discovered that flight 611 broke apart in mid-air when as it was reaching 35,000 feet. All 225 people on the plane were killed. This was one of the worst disaster in aviation history involving explosive decompression. China Airlines has had nine fatal crashes between 1970 and 2002. This is the worst record in commercial aviation.
Shortly after the plane vanished, Taiwan launched one of the country's largest search-and-rescue operations. As the plane broke apart in mid-air, wreckage were spread over a large area and this makes it difficult to recover all the wreckage. When the search-and-rescue teams arrived, they realised they could not do anything-all 225 people onboard were dead.
When there was no more hope for survivors, the teams started to recover wreckage and human remains. These were sent to Penghu Islands. There, the wreckage were numbered and the human remains were sent for identification. In the end, out of 225 people on board, 175 bodies were recovered. 50 remain in the sea.
The investigation of the crash was by Aviation Safety Council (ASC) of Taiwan. During the investigation, it was found that the crash of China Airlines Flight 611 was similar with another crash, TWA flight 800. Investigators found out that both crashes had similar points such as:
However, unlike flight 800, investigators determined that flight 611 was not caused by a fuel tank explosion.
As the investigation continues, both recorders of the flight were recovered. However, investigators could not find any possible cause from the recorders as the flight data recorder showed that the plane was working properly before it broke up. The cockpit voice recorder also showed nothing unusual. The recorder started ten minutes before the flight. After a last sentence said by captain Yi Ching-Fung, "two thousand" at 3.26pm, the recorder captured nothing more spoken. Then, the sound of the plane breaking up was heard at about 3.29pm.
With nothing possible showing up, investigators decided to use a method that the investigators of TWA Flight 800 used. Using several pieces of wreckage, investigators were able to use a computer and find out which piece fell off first. This provided a major clue-the wreckage from the back of the plane fell first. So, investigators began looking for wreckage from the back of the plane.
Finally, investigators managed to find a piece of wreckage which was damaged in the tailstrike incident in 1980. A doubler plate was placed over the scratches that the tailstrike caused. The piece, item number 640, was sent to Taipei for further examination.
When investigators removed the doubler that was installed over Item 640, they found out that the scratches, caused by the tailstrike 22 years ago, were still there. This was not the proper way to repair the damage from the tailstrike. From this investigators found out what really happened 22 years ago.
According to the Boeing SRM (Structural Repair Manual), the scratches should be sanded down. But as the scratches caused by the tailstrike were too deep, the correct way to repair is to cut out the damaged section, then put a doubler plate that is 30% larger than the section that was cut out. However, in the repair of the accident plane, the workers did not follow the instructions. Instead they just placed a doubler plate over the damaged section, which was not 30% larger than the section that was supposed to be cut out. This weakened the structure behind the doubler. The workers then made one more mistake, by writing in the repair log that the repair was done correctly. So, anyone reading the log book would assume that the repair was done correctly and that the workers had cut out the damaged section and replaced it.
Over the years, the cracks under the doubler grew worse and worse. Every time the plane took off and landed the cracks increased in length, in the end reaching 2.3 metres. Then, on May 25, 2002, the cracks reached the breaking point. It grew in all directions and caused the whole tail to break away from the plane. The plane went into a steep dive and was torn apart.
Another possible reason why the mistake could not be found out is that the maintenance procedures of China Airlines. In 1988, the roof of Aloha Airlines Flight 243 peeled off when the plane was cruising, causing explosive decompression. The plane landed safely. After the accident, the FAA ordered that the airlines evaluate again all the previous repairs that was done on planes.
China Airlines began evaluating the repairs in 2001. The workers took photographs of 31 different doublers on different 747s, including the one on B-18255. Although there was a stain on the doubler, the workers chose to ignore it. The stain was actually caused by smoke as passengers were allowed to smoke until 1995. The smoke was forced out through the crack and nicotine stained the plane's skin. It was said in Mayday that if China Airlines went on to find out how the stain formed, they may find out the cracks and prevent the crash.
The workers then scheduled the next maintenance check, 7C, on November 2, 2002. The check would definitely have led the workers to find out the cracks. However, the plane crashed 5 months before the check.
China Airlines no longer uses 611 as its flight number.

Sarin

Sarin is a nerve gas, a deadly poison. It was designed as a chemical weapon for use in war by Nazi Germany.
It has been classified as a weapon of mass destruction in UN Resolution 687. Production and stockpiling of sarin was outlawed by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993, and it is classified as a Schedule 1 substance.
Sarin can be lethal even at very low concentrations. Death comes in 1 to 10 minutes after breathing it in. It paralyses lung muscles. Antidotes, such as atropine, can save a person if given immediately.
People who get a non-lethal dose, but do not get immediate treatment, may suffer permanent neurological damage.
Like other nerve agents, sarin attacks the nervous system by stopping nerve endings in muscles from switching off. Death will usually occur as a result of asphyxia due to the inability to control the muscles involved in breathing function.
In vertebrates, acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used at the neuromuscular junction, where signals are transmitted between neurons from the central nervous system to muscle fibres.
Normally, acetylcholine is released from the neuron to stimulate the muscle, after which it is degraded by acetylcholinesterase. This allows the muscle to relax. Inhibition of cholinesterase means the neurotransmitter continues to act on the muscle fibre. This stops breathing.
Sarin was discovered in 1938 in Wuppertal-Elberfeld in Germany by scientists at IG Farben attempting to create stronger pesticides. it is the most toxic of the four G-Series nerve agents made by Germany.
In mid-1939, the formula for the agent was passed to the chemical warfare section of the German Army Weapons Office, which ordered that it be brought into mass production for wartime use. It was not used in World War II.
In medicine, the acronym SLUDGE is used to remember some of the symptoms of sarin poisoning:
Other symptoms of sarin poisoning include:

Centimetre-gram-second system of units

The centimetre-gram-second system (abbreviated CGS or cgs) is a variant of the metric system. The derived units are on the centimeter as the unit of length, the gram as a unit of mass and the second as a unit of time. The system evolved in the nineteenth century when it was used to define both electrical and mechanical units. 
The cgs units of energy and force are the "dyne" and the "erg". 
The coherent cgs unit of pressure was the "barye" (symbol Ba). A "bayre" is one dyne per square centimeter. 
Many non-coherent units of pressure were used in the cgs system. They include:
The dyne and the erg were used to define the units for electrical quantities. Two different forms of cgs units were developed. One form was developed for electrostatic units and another for electromagnetic units. Electrical engineering units were based on the MKS (metre-kilogram-second) system instead of the CGS system.
During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries many other units were defined using cgs units. In 1960 the BIPM published the International System of Units (SI) which was based on the metre, the kilogram, the second and the ampere. SI has now replaced the CGS system of units in most applications.

Blood–brain barrier

The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective permeability barrier. It controls what gets from the bloodstream into the brain, and what does not.
For example, things that the brain needs to survive (water, glucose, and amino acids) can get through the barrier. However, the barrier stops many harmful things, like bacteria and viruses, from getting into the brain. This helps protect the brain from getting an infection.
The blood-brain barrier is formed by capillary endothelial cells. It allows the passage of water, some gases, and lipid-soluble molecules by passive diffusion. It also allows the selective transport of molecules such as glucose and amino acids which are crucial to nerve function. On the other hand, the blood-brain barrier may prevent the entry of neurotoxins by means of an active transport mechanism. 
A few small areas in the brain do not have a blood-brain barrier. 
Paul Ehrlich, a German doctor, discovered the blood-brain barrier. He injected dye into mice's bloodstreams. The dye got to every organ except the brain. The blood-brain barrier had stopped the dye from getting through to the brain. Then one of Ehrlich's students injected the dye right into the mice's brains. This time the brain turned blue, but no other organs did. The blood-brain barrier had stopped the dye from getting out of the brain into the bloodstream (which would have carried the dye to every other organ in the body).
The blood–brain barrier protects the brain from many common infections. Infections of the brain are rare. If they do happen, they are often serious and difficult to treat. Antibodies (which the body's immune system makes to fight infections) are too large to cross the blood–brain barrier. Also, many antibiotics cannot pass through the BBB to kill the infection in the brain. 
One way to get medications into the brain is to inject them into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF helps protect the brain and spinal cord. However, it does not actually touch the brain. Instead, two of the layers that protect the brain and spinal cord hold the CSF. Because of this, even if medications are injected right into the CSF, they still do not get into the brain very well. 
Some bacteria, viruses, and other things can get through the blood-brain barrier and damage the brain. For example:

Some of the units are called "base units". These units can be defined by arbitrarily. Other units are called derived units. They are defined using the base units. 
The most common systems of units today are the International System of Units (SI), the Imperial units and the United States customary units. 
The base units of SI are the metre, the second, the kilogram, the ampere, the kelvin, the candela and the mole. SI has many derived units which include the watt, newton and joule. SI is called a "coherent system of units" because the constant factor in the definition of it derived units is always 1.
The base units of the imperial system and the United States customary system are the pound avoirdupois, the yard and the second. Derived units found in the Imperial and Customary systems of units include horsepower and Pounds per square inch.

The 'Invader' was used in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War by the United States. The French used it in the Algeria War. After 1946 its role in the US was changed from an attack aircraft to a bomber aircraft. The letter 'A' (for attack) in its name was changed to a 'B' (for bomber). It became the B-26 Invader. This caused some confusion because the Air Force already had the Martin B-26 Marauder, which is a different aircraft. Some A-26 Invaders were used during the 1950s by the United States Forest Service to fight forest fires. In this role the plane was used to put out wildfires from the air by dropping first , then later water and other retardants.

Recent molecular data from rRNA, and from mtDNA, show that these living agnathans are monophyletic. There are about 100 species. Hagfish are vertebrates but do not have vertebrae. It is believed that they lost their vertebrae during their lifestyle adaptations.
The name Cyclostomata means "round mouths". Their mouths cannot close due to the lack of a jaw, so they have to constantly cycle water through the mouth.

Space debris is the collection of useless objects that are in orbit around Earth, like broken satellites, empty rockets, pieces of metal, and many more. Because of how much space debris there is, collisions happen between space debris and sometimes even operational spacecraft, creating more debris.

Kessler Syndrome

Kessler Syndrome (or an ablation cascade) is a thought-up situation made by the NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler in which the amount of space debris in orbit is large enough to cause space collisions to happen often. This would make space mostly unusable for years if it happened at an extreme level.
There is a satellite in orbit that is large and inactive, making it count as space debris, but it is in an orbit with a large amount of space debris. Two known objects get within 200m of it every year. This could cause a lot of space debris, inducing a domino effect with more collisions.
Satellite manufacturers must demonstrate that their satellite can safely destroy itself or boost itself into a higher or lower orbit, known as a graveyard orbit, to avoid keeping unused satellites in common orbits for other satellites.
