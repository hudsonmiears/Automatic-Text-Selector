Movius Line

The Movius Line is a theoretical line drawn across northern India. It was proposed by the American archaeologist Hallam L. Movius in 1948 to show a technological difference between the early prehistoric tool technologies of the east and the west of the Old World.
Movius noticed that the palaeolithic stone tools from sites east of northern India never contained handaxes. They had less formal implements known as chopping tools. These were sometimes as extensively worked as the Acheulean tools from further west, but could not be described as true handaxes. Movius then drew a line on a map of India to show where the difference occurred, dividing the tools of Africa, Europe and Western and Southern Asia from those of Eastern and South-eastern Asia.
Fossil evidence also suggests a difference in the evolutionary development of the people who made the two different tool types across the Movius Line. The line is still in use as a distinction between the two traditions. The existence of the line, in terms of stone tool technology and human evolution, is still not explained.

Think of the children

"Think of the children" (also "What about the children?") is a phrase that became a strategy used when you are in an argument with someone. Basically in its simplest use it can mean just children's rights, like for example talking about child labor problems. But when this phrase is used in the middle of an argument, it can be used to try to make people feel emotional when thinking about the needs of children, and then to try and fool people into doing what they want because they might be scared that they do not want to harm children.
The 2002 book "Art, Argument, and Advocacy" (2002) said that using this phrase replaced emotion instead of reason in the middle of an argument with someone. Ethicist Jack Marshall wrote in 2005 that the phrase is so popular because it can stop people from behaving rationally especially when they are talking about morals. "Think of the children" was used by censorship supporters to try to defend children from things they thought were dangerous to these young people. The book "Community, Space and Online Censorship" (2009) wrote that calling children just babies in need of protection was a form of focusing too much on the concept of purity. A 2011 article in the "Journal for Cultural Research" wrote that "Think of the children" was caused by people thinking too hard about telling everyone what to do and the difference between right-and-wrong.
"Think of the children" as a phrase was used in the 1964 Walt Disney Pictures film "Mary Poppins"; where Mrs. Banks pleaded with her departing nanny not to quit and to asked her to "Think of the children!". Its use was popularized through satire on the television program "The Simpsons", beginning in 1996. Character Helen Lovejoy pleaded: "Won't somebody please think of the children!" during loud arguments in the town of Springfield on the TV show.
Law professor Charles J. Ten Brink in the 2012 "Georgia State University Law Review" wrote that "The Simpsons" character Helen Lovejoy's use of "Think of the children" was a good form of parody. The phrase's use was made fun of a lot when people used it in politics. After it became popular on "The Simpsons", use of the phrase was called "Lovejoy's Law", the "Helen Lovejoy defence", the "Helen Lovejoy Syndrome", and "think-of-the-children-ism".

Maternal insult

A maternal insult (also referred to as a "yo mama" joke) is a reference to a person's mother. This is through the use of phrases such as "your mother" or other variations, often used to insult the target by way of their mother. "Your mother" can be combined with most types of insults, although suggestions of promiscuity are common. One of the purposes of these insults is to incite violence. Slang variants such as "yo mama", "yo momma", "yer ma", "ya mum", "your mum" or "your mom" are sometimes used, depending on the local dialect. 
When Joram saw Jehu, he said, "Is it peace, Jehu?"<br>
And he answered, "What peace, so long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?"
"Painter": "Y'are a dog."<br>
"Apemantus": "Thy mother's of my generation. What's she, if I be a dog?"
" “...of your mother is by the one who has intercourse with her. What/who is it?<br>
(No answer)”
While it cannot be completely deciphered, it is clear some comment is being made about somebody's mother.

Origins of the blues

The origin of the blues. Little is known about the origin of the music known as the blues. No year can be cited as the origin, because the style evolved over a long period. Ethnomusicologist Gerhard Kubik traces the roots of many of its elements back to the African continent, the "cradle of the blues". 
One early mention comes from 1901, when an archaeologist in Mississippi described the songs of black workers which had lyrical themes and technical elements in common with the blues.
There are few characteristics common to all blues. The genre takes its shape from the peculiarities of each individual performance. Some characteristics are common to most styles of African American music. The earliest blues-like music was a "functional expression, rendered in a call-and-response style without accompaniment or harmony and unbounded by the formality of any particular musical structure". This pre-blues music was adapted from the field shouts and hollers performed during slave times, expanded into "simple solo songs laden with emotional content".
Many of these blues elements, such as the call-and-response format, can be traced back to the music of Africa. When African slaves went to work in North America, they took musical traditions with them. Early forms of music include spirituals and work songs. Spirituals were religious songs and work songs were sung to the rhythm of working. Work songs included a vocal call and response, or where the lead drummer makes a beat and then the others respond to it. 
The majority of blues songs have four beats in a bar, and are built on the 12 bar blues form which uses three phrases, each four bars long. They can also use the blue scale.

Bye (sports)

A bye in sports and other competitive activities can have two different meanings. Both mean that a participant in a competition is not required to compete while most of the other participants are. Its main use is in tournament competitions. In single-elimination tournaments, when there are an odd number of participants, a bye allows one or more to play in a later round. Other types of eliminator tournaments may also include a bye for others reasons. An example would be as a reward for the best ranked team(s).
In round-robin tournaments where there are an odd number of competitors, usually one gets a bye in each round. However, over the whole tournament, each team plays the same number of games.
Similar to the round-robin context, in leagues where most teams play on the same days during regular-season play, a team that does not play on a given day is said to be on bye. In sports that are played weekly, especially gridiron football, a team that does not play at all during a given week is said to be on its bye week. For example, during the regular football Season in the NFL, each team gets a week off (bye week) during the regular season.

Ptolemaic dynasty

The Ptolemaic dynasty, also known as the Lagids or Lagidae, was a Macedonian Greek royal family who ruled over Egypt. Their rule lasted for 275 years, from 305 BC to 30 BC. They were the last dynasty of ancient Egypt.
Ptolemy, was one of Alexander the Great's generals and deputies. He was appointed satrap of Egypt after Alexander's death in 323 BC. In 305 BC, he declared himself King Ptolemy I, later known as "Soter" (saviour). The Egyptians soon accepted the Ptolemies as the successors to the pharaohs of independent Egypt. Unlike their previous rulers under the Achaemenid Empire, they usually lived in Egypt. Ptolemy's family ruled Egypt until the Roman conquest of 30 BC.
All the male rulers of the dynasty took the name Ptolemy. Ptolemaic queens, some of whom were the sisters of their husbands, were usually called Cleopatra, Arsinoe or Berenice. The most famous, was the last queen, Cleopatra VII. She was involved in the Roman political battles between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and later between Octavian and Mark Antony. Her death marked the end of Ptolemaic rule in Egypt.
Dates in brackets represent the ruling dates of the Ptolemaic pharaohs. They often ruled jointly with their wives, who were often also their sisters. Several queens exercised royal authority, but the most famous and successful was Cleopatra VII (51–30 BC), with her two brothers and her son as successive nominal co-rulers. Several systems exist for numbering the later rulers; the one used here is the one most widely used by modern scholars.
Members of the Ptolemaic dynasty were described as extremely obese. Their sculptures and coins show prominent eyes and swollen necks. Graves' disease within the family could explain the swollen necks and eye prominence (exophthalmos), although this is unlikely if they were simply obese.
Members of this dynasty likely suffered from a multi-organ fibrotic condition such as Erdheim–Chester disease or a familial multifocal fibrosclerosis. With this condition, then thyroiditis, obesity and ocular proptosis can all occur at the same time.

<doc id="516966" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=516966" title="Hedjet">
Hedjet

Hedjet is the name for the White Crown of Upper Egypt, used in Ancient Egypt. The crown was white and after Lower and Upper Egypt joined together, it was combined with the Deshret, the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. This Double Crown was called the Pschent. The symbol sometimes used for the Hedjet was the vulture goddess Nekhbet. This would be shown next to the head of the cobra goddess Wadjet, the Uraeus on the Pschent.
The white crown has a long history, going back into the Predynastic Period. This shows that kingship had been the base of Egyptian society for some time. The earliest image of the Hedjet was thought to have been in the Qustul in Nubia. New discoveries, particularly the excavation of Cemetery U and the tome U-j, dating to Naqada IIIA have shown that it appears earlier in Egypt.
Nekhbet, the protective goddess of Nekhebet (modern el Kab) near Hierakonpolis, was shown as a woman, sometimes with the head of a vulture, wearing the White Crown. The falcon god Horus of Hierakonpolis (Egyptian: Nekhen) was generally shown wearing a White Crown. The White Crown is on the Narmer Palette found at Hierakonpolis. It shows the king of the South wearing the "hedjet", triumphing over his northern enemies. The kings of the united Egypt saw themselves as successors of Horus. Vases from the reign of Khasekhemwy show the king as Horus wearing the White Crown.
As with the Deshret (Red Crown), no example of the White Crown has survived. It is unknown how it was made or what materials were used. It is possible it was made from felt or leather. The fact that no crown has ever been found, might suggest that the crown was passed from one ruler to the next, much as in present day monarchies.

The list names 58 kings, from Anedjib and Qa'a in the First Dynasty to Ramesses II in the Nineteenth Dynasty. The list is in reverse chronological order. It leaves out names of "rulers from the Second Intermediate Period, the Hyksos, and those rulers... who had been close to the heretic Akhenaten".
Each name is surrounded by a border known as a cartouche). The stone is badly damaged, and only 47 names have survived. There are mistakes in the list. For example, it only mentions four kings of the Third Dynasty. The order is correct only for the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty. The only known photograph of the king list was published in 1865.
The names are listed in reverse chronological order from the upper right to the bottom left, as they were meant to be read.

<doc id="517063" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=517063" title="Doo-wop">
Doo-wop

Doo-wop is a genre of music that was developed in African-American communities in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore, Newark, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Detroit, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. It started in the 1940s. Doo-wop achieved mainstream popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s. Built upon vocal harmony, doo-wop was one of the most mainstream, pop-oriented R&B styles of the time. Singer Bill Kenny (1914–1978) is often called the "Godfather of Doo-wop". He introduced the "top and bottom" format which featured a high tenor singing the lead and a bass singer reciting the lyrics in the middle of the song. Doo-wop features vocal group harmony, nonsense syllables, a simple beat, sometimes little or no instrumentation, and simple music and lyrics.
The first record to use the syllables "doo-wop" was the 1955 hit "When You Dance" by the Turbans. The term "doo-wop" first appeared in print in 1961. During the late 1950s many Italian-American groups added to the doo-wop scene. The peak of doo-wop was in 1961. Doo-wop's influence continued in soul, pop, and rock groups of the 1960s. At various times in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the genre has seen revivals. Doo-wop was a precursor to many of the afro-American musical styles seen today. An evolution of jazz and blues, doo-wop also influenced many of the major Rock and Roll groups that defined the later decades of the 20th century. Doo-wop is iconic for it’s swing-like beats and using the off-beat to keep time. Doo-wop laid the foundation for many musical innovations, for example, R&B.
It has had a revival recently as Meghan Trainor usually makes songs with in the genre.

Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The director is responsible for the day-to-day operations. Along with the deputy director, the director makes sure cases and operations are handled correctly. The director also is in charge of hiring the leaders in any one of the FBI field offices with qualified agents. The director advised the president on any issues that arose from within the FBI. This was until the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 was enacted in response to the September 11 attacks. Since then, the director reports to the Director of National Intelligence, who in turn reports to the president.
Directors are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. In theory, they serve ten-year terms unless they resign, die, or are let go. In reality, none have served a full ten years, except J. Edgar Hoover and Robert Mueller. They both served longer than ten years. J. Edgar Hoover was appointed by Calvin Coolidge to the office in 1924. He was by far the longest-serving director. Hoover held the position from its establishment under the current title in 1935 until his death in 1972 because there was then no law limiting service time. In response to Hoover's lengthy tenure, Congress imposed a term limit of ten years (waived by the Senate for Robert Mueller on July 27, 2011). The current FBI director is James Comey, who assumed his position on September 4, 2013.
When the Bureau of Investigation (BOI) was established in 1908, its head was called the Chief of the Bureau of Investigation. It was changed to the Director of the Bureau of Investigation since the term of William J. Flynn (1919–1921), and to its current name when the BOI was renamed FBI in 1935.

Co-education

Co-educational means education for boys and girls together. It means mixed-sex education. The practice has been different in different countries, and at different times.
Most primary schools have been co-educational for a long time. There is no reason to educate females separately before the age of puberty. Also, the curriculum in primary schools is not controversial. It emphasises reading, writing and arithmetic, with some elementary knowledge of geography and history. In some countries it includes some religious education.
However, before the mid-19th century, girls were often educated at home, or were not educated at all. On this point, there were great differences in different parts of the world. In England and Wales, universal primary education was set up by the Elementary Education Act of 1870, and attendance from the ages of 5 to 10 was compulsory. This was extended in another Act of 1880. Since then. almost all primary education in the United Kingdom has been co-educational, and so it is in many other countries.
With secondary education, children go through the process of puberty, and there is no general agreement as to whether the two genders should be educated together. There are arguments for and against. At one extreme is the United States, where both sexes are educated together at all stages. At the other extreme are certain traditional societies where girls do not get a secondary education at all. The tendency has been for more countries to move to co-education as the standard at every level of education.

The Temple Institute ( – "") is a museum, research institute and education center in Old City of Jerusalem. It was established in 1987 by Rabbi Yisrael Ariel. The Institute is dedicated to the two Temples in Jerusalem (called the First and Second Temples). Rabbi Ariel plans to rebuild the Second Temple on the man-made plateau the Jews call the Temple Mount. The site is currently occupied by an Islamic shrine, the Dome of the Rock. The institute has collected tens of thousands of dollars, mostly from Jews in the United States. This is in spite of the fact that rebuilding the temple of Herod, destroyed by the Romans in 79 AD, would almost certainly cause a major war. In 2014, the government of Jordan sent a letter to the State of Israel warning them to guard against any attacks by extremist groups against the Temple Mount.

<doc id="517185" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=517185" title="Diodorus Siculus">
Diodorus Siculus

Diodorus Siculus or Diodorus of Sicily was a Greek historian. He is known for writing the universal history "Bibliotheca historica", much of which survives, between 60 and 30 BC. It is arranged in three parts. The first part covers mythic history up to the destruction of Troy. It is arranged geographically, describing regions around the world including Egypt, India, Arabia, Greece and Europe. The second part covers the Trojan War to the death of Alexander the Great. The third part covers the period to about 60 BC. The title Bibliotheca, meaning 'library', shows that he was using the work of many other authors.
Diodorus wrote that he was born at Agyrium in Sicily (now called Agira). There is only two other references to Diodorus. One is by Jerome, in his "Chronicon" from 49 BC, who wrote that "Diodorus of Sicily, a writer of Greek history, became illustrious". There is also a Greek inscription in the collection of the Agyrium (Inscriptiones Graecae XIV, 588) about the tombstone of one "Diodorus, the son of Apollonius". (This may be a different person).
Diodorus' book, which he called "Bibliotheca historica" meaning "Historical Library", consisted of 40 books. Books 1–5 and 11–20 survive. Small sections of the lost books are preserved in Photius and the excerpts of Constantine Porphyrogenitus.
It was divided into three sections. The first six books treated the mythic history of the non-Hellenic and Hellenic tribes to the destruction of Troy and are geographical in theme, and describe the history and culture of Ancient Egypt (book I), of Mesopotamia, India, Scythia, and Arabia (II), of North Africa (III), and of Greece and Europe (IV–VI).
In the next section (books VII–XVII), he tells the history of the world from the Trojan War down to the death of Alexander the Great. The last section (books XVII to the end) concerns the historical events from the successors of Alexander down to either 60 BC or the beginning of Julius Caesar's Gallic Wars. As the last books have been lost, it is not known if Diodorus reached the beginning of the Gallic War as he promised at the beginning of his work or, as evidence suggests, old and tired from his labours he stopped at 60 BC.) He used the name "Bibliotheca" to show that he was writing a work from many sources. Identified authors on whose works he drew include Hecataeus of Abdera, Ctesias of Cnidus, Ephorus, Theopompus, Hieronymus of Cardia, Duris of Samos, Diyllus, Philistus, Timaeus, Polybius, and Posidonius.
His writing of gold mining in Nubia in eastern Egypt is one of the earliest texts on the topic, and describes in vivid detail the use of slave labour in terrible working conditions.
He also described the Celts:
"Physically the Celts are terrifying in appearance with deep-sounding and very harsh voices. In conversation they use few words and speak in riddles, for the most part hinting at things and leaving a great deal to be understood. They frequently exaggerate with the aim of extolling themselves and diminishing the status of others. They are boasters and threateners, and given to bombastic self-dramatization, and yet they are quick of mind and with good natural ability for learning." (Book 5)

A Multi-party system is a system where multiple political parties that have different ideas participate in the national elections. These parties also have an equal chance to win the elections. A lot of countries that use this system have a coalition government, meaning many parties are in control, and they all work together to make laws. Good examples of countries that have this system include Brazil, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Taiwan and Philippines.

Thinis or This (Egyptian: Tjenu) was the capital city of the first dynasties of ancient Egypt. The actual site of Thinis has not yet been discovered. Ancient writers, such as Manetho, said it was the centre of the Thinite Confederacy. Their leader Menes (or Narmer), united Egypt and was its first pharaoh. In the Third Dynasty the capital was moved to Memphis. This meant that Thinis was no longer important. It still played a role in administration becauset was close to border of the competing Heracleopolitan and Theban dynasties of the First Intermediate Period. It was also near oases of military importance, during the Old and New Kingdoms. Thinis lost its position as a regional administrative centre by the Roman period.
Due to its ancient heritage, Thinis remained a significant religious centre. It was the home to the tomb and mummy of the local god. In ancient Egyptian religious cosmology, as seen (for example) in the "Book of the Dead", Thinis played a role as a mythical place in heaven.
The exact site of Thinis is unknown. Historians believe its was near ancient Abydos and modern Girga.

Cartouche

A cartouche is a hieroglyphic symbol of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh. It is oval with a horizontal line at one end, showing that the text enclosed is a royal name. 
It starts to be used at the beginning of the Fourth Dynasty under Pharaoh Sneferu. The cartouche is usually vertical with a horizontal line, but it is horizontal if it makes the name fit better, with a vertical line on the left. The Ancient Egyptian word for it was "shenu". In demotic writing, the cartouche was reduced to a pair of brackets and a vertical line.
Of the five royal titles it was the "prenomen", the throne name, and the "Son of Ra" titulary, the so-called "nomen" name given at birth, which were enclosed by a cartouche.
At times amulets were given the form of a cartouche displaying the name of a king and placed in tombs. Such items are often important to archaeologists for dating the tomb and its contents. Cartouches were only worn by pharaohs.

<doc id="517206" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=517206" title="Amarna period">
Amarna period

The Amarna period was an era of Ancient Egypt in the last half of the Eighteenth dynasty.
The royal residence of the pharaoh and his queen was shifted to Akhetaten ('Horizon of the Aten') in what is now Amarna. It was marked by the reign of Amenhotep IV, who changed his name to Akhenaten (1353–1336 BC). This was to underline the dramatic change of Egypt's polytheistic religion into one where the sun disc Aten was worshipped over all other gods. Aten was not solely worshipped (the religion was not monotheistic), but other gods were worshipped to a significantly lesser degree. The Egyptian pantheon of the equality of all gods and goddesses was restored under Akhenaten's successor.
During Akhenaten's reign, royal portraiture changed. Sculptures of Akhenaten are different from those of earlier pharaohs. Akhenaten is shown in an androgynous (less manly) and stylized manner, with large thighs, a slim torso, drooping belly, full lips, and a long neck and nose. Some believe that the break with convention was due to "the presence at Amarna of new people or groups of artists whose background and training were different from those of the Karnak sculptors".
The events following Akhenaten's death are unclear and the identity and policies of his co-regent and immediate successor Smenkhkare are unclear.
Tutankhamun died before he was twenty years old, and the dynasty's final years clearly were shaky. The royal line of the dynasty died out with Tutankhamun. Two fetuses found buried in his tomb may have been his twin daughters who would have continued the royal lineage, according to a 2008 investigation.
The last two members of the eighteenth dynasty – Ay and Horemheb – became rulers from the ranks of officials in the royal court. Ay may have married the widow of Tutankhamun in order to get power and she did not live long afterward. Ay's reign was short. His successor was Horemheb, a general in the Egyptian army, who had been a diplomat in the administration of Tutankhamun. He may have been named as a successor by the childless Tutankhamun. Horemheb may have taken the throne away from Ay in a coup. He also died childless and appointed his successor, Paramessu who, under the name Ramesses I, ascended the throne in 1292 BC. He was the first pharaoh of the Nineteenth dynasty.

Edward Sims Van Zile

Edward Sims Van Zile (May 2, 1863 - May 29, 1931) was an American writer. He published fiction, non-fiction, biographies, a commentary on war, and a history of the early days of movies. In 1904, in an essay about him, "Book News Biographies" said "for the past ten years Mr. Van Zile has been known to the reading public through many short stories, novelettes and a few novels".
He was born on May 2, 1863 in Troy, New York to Oscar Edward Van Zile and Sarah Melinda Perry. He was a descendant of Hollanders who came to America in the 17th century. As a boy he read everything he could on every subject. He graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut in 1884. In 1904 the college gave him the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters. In addition to several books and articles, he wrote a libretto for a musical comedy.
In 1887 he married Mary Bulkeley. They had a daughter, Winifred Van Zile (1902-1902). He died on May 29, 1931 of a stroke at his home at 439 East Fifty-first Street in Manhattan, New York City. He was buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, Connecticut.
By 1876, baseball scores were telegraphed, inning by inning, to newspaper offices. Fans who did not want to wait for the newspaper coverage of away games waited at newspaper offices. Some newspapers put up blackboards trying to show the progress of a game as they received the telegraphs.
In 1888, Van Zile was working as an editorial writer at the New York World. He found himself doodling an idea on a notepad. He was, subconsciously he later said, working out a diagram of a baseball diamond. On it he showed pegs indicating the positions of players and other information. Edwin Grozier, at the time Private Secretary to Joseph Pulitzer, looking over his shoulder said "Van Zile, you get that idea patented, and I'll give you $250 for your interest in it." He had come up with what he called a "Bulletin Board and Base Ball Indicator." He filed for a patent in 1888 and it was issued in 1889. It was a major breakthrough in showing the progress of baseball games. The World newspaper placed a large version of it outside their offices for that year’s baseball championship series. It was a tremendous hit. Crowds of up to 6,000 watched to get a play-by-play view of the games.

Second Dynasty of Egypt

The Second Dynasty ruled ancient Egypt from c. 2890 to c. 2686 BC It is the second dynasty of the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt. During this time the seat of government was centred at Thinis. Very little is known about this period in ancient Egyptian history.
There is very little archaeological evidence of the time. But to compare the differences between the First and Third Dynasties shows that there must have important institutional and economic developments during the Second Dynasty.
The names of the rulers of the Second Dynasty is not known exactly. Most sources agree on the names of the first pharaohs. These are:
The names of the next two or three rulers is unclear. We may have both the Horus-name or "Nebty" (meaning "two ladies") name "and" their birth names for these rulers, however they may be entirely different individuals; or they may be legendary names. On the left are the rulers most Egyptologists place here; on the right are the names from Manetho's "Aegyptica":
With the last ruler, we return to an agreement:
Manetho wrote that the capital was at Thinis, the same as during the First Dynasty. However, at least the first three kings were buried at Saqqara. This could mean the center of power had moved to Memphis. Beyond this, little can be said about the events during this period. The annual records on the Palermo Stone only survive for the end of the reign of Nebra and for parts of Nynetjer's. One important event possibly happened during the reign of Khasekhemwy: many Egyptologists read his name ("the Two Powers arise") as commemorating the union of the Upper and Lower Egypts.

Hereditary haemochromatosis

Hereditary haemochromatosis is a disease caused by a genetic disorder in which a person accumulates a dangerous level of iron in a body.
Humans, like most animals, have no means to excrete excess iron. Excess iron accumulates in tissues and organs disrupting their normal function.
The hereditary form of the disease is most common among those of Northern European ancestry, in particular those of Celtic descent. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

Vyasa

Vyasa (, , literally “Compiler”) is an important figure in most Hindu traditions. He is sometimes called Veda Vyāsa (वेदव्यास, "veda-vyāsa", "the one who classified the Vedas") or Krishna Dvaipāyana (referring to his complexion and birthplace). He is the author of the "Mahabharata". He is also a character in it. He is considered to be the scribe of both the Vedas and Puranas. According to Hindu beliefs, Vyasa is an avatar of the god Vishnu. Vyasa is also considered to be one of the seven Chiranjivins (long lived, or immortals), who are still in existence according to Hindu belief.
Vyasa lived around the 3rd millennium BCE. The festival of "Guru Purnima" is dedicated to him. It is also known as "Vyasa Purnima", for it is the day believed to be both his birthday and the day he divided the Vedas.
Vyasa appears for the first time as the compiler of, and an important character in, the "Mahabharata". It is said that he was the expansion of the god Vishnu who came in Dwaparayuga to make all the Vedic knowledge available in writing which was available in only in spoken form at that time. He was the son of Satyavati, daughter of the fisherman Dusharaj, and the wandering sage Parashara. He is credited with being the author of the first Purana, Vishnu Purana). Vyasa was born on an island in the Yamuna river. There are two different views regarding the place of his birth. One of the views suggests that he was born in the Tanahun district in western Nepal. Another view suggests that he was born on Island in Yamuna river near Kalpi, Uttar Pradesh, India. Vyasa had a dark complexion and may be called by the name "Krishna" (black), and also the name "Dwaipayana", meaning 'island-born'.

Will H. Hays

William Harrison Hays, Sr. (November 5, 1879 – March 7, 1954) was chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1918–21. He was United States Postmaster General from 1921–22. He is best known for the Hays Code for censorship of American movies. He was born in Sullivan, Indiana.
He was the manager of Warren G. Harding's successful campaign for the Presidency of the United States in 1920. He was then named Postmaster General. While serving in the Harding Administration, he became somewhat involved in the Teapot Dome scandal. This was because of some illegal donations.
Hays gave up his cabinet position on January 14, 1922. He become President of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), when it first began. This group now handles the well-known voluntary film rating system. He began his new job, at a $35,360 () annual salary, on March 6 of that year. There was talk that he would be paid between $100,000 and $150,000 a year.
The goal of the group was to rescue the image of the movie industry because of a scandal at that time. An actress, Virginia Rappe, had been raped and murdered. A well-known movie star, Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle was accused. Religious groups were angry and demanded federal censorship of the movies. Hiring Hays to "clean up the moving pictures" was a public relations tactic. Much was said about his conservative ways. These included his being a Presbyterian deacon and the past chairman of the Republican Party.
In his new role in Hollywood, Hays' main task was to stop American state censor boards from banning movies that were too dirty to be shown. He also had to keep costs down for the movie studios for changes made to give a movie an acceptable rating. At that time, the movie studios were required by state laws to pay the censor boards for each foot of movie that was cut out. Studios also had the expense of making different versions of each censored movie for each state's different ruling.
Hays tried to reduce studio costs by telling studios how to make movies that would be safe enough not to have to be cut or changed. Each board kept its "standards" secret. Hays had to try to guess what would or would not be allowed by each board. He made a set of guidelines he called "The Don'ts and Be Carefuls". In general he was not successful in quieting demands for federal censorship.
Catholic bishops and non-church people were suspicious of federal censorship. They preferred the Hays approach of self-censorship. For several months in 1929, a group of Catholic leaders tried to come up with a new stricter code of behavior for the movies. A church Father wrote the legal code. This later became known as "The Hays Code". It was shown to Will Hays in 1930. He said, "My eyes nearly popped out when I read it. This was the very thing I had been looking for".
From 1930 to 1934, the Production Code was only somewhat helpful in fighting off calls for federal censorship. Things came to a head in 1934, with widespread threats of Catholic boycotts of immoral movies. The studios gave the MPAA full authority to enforce the Production Code on all studios. These strict rules of self-censorship lasted for decades. (The Code was finally set aside in the 1960s when the MPAA adopted the age-based rating system now in force.) 
Also in 1934, Hays made a list of 117 names of actors and actresses whose personal lives he thought made them unfit to appear in movies.
Many European nations had quotas to make more of their own movies instead of Hollywood imports. A big success of Hays was his ability to work with the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Department of Commerce, to keep Hollywood on top of overseas movie markets.
After his retirement, Will H. Hays returned to Sullivan, Indiana, where he died on March 7, 1954. His widow died in 1960.

Bathory is the first studio album by the Swedish extreme metal band Bathory. It was released in October 1984, through Tyfon Grammofon. Many people say that this album is the very first black metal album.
The band Bathory was formed one year earlier. Quorthon was working part-time at the small record label Tyfon. In late 1983 and early 1984, the label was putting together a lot of songs by Scandinavian metal bands. At the last minute, one of the bands backed out. Tyfon agreed to let Bathory appear on the record as a replacement, and the band recorded two songs for the compilation—"Sacrifice" and "The Return of the Darkness and Evil"—in January. The album, "Scandinavian Metal Attack", was released in March 1984 and was Bathory's first appearance on record. Much of the fan-mail was directed towards Bathory, and Tyfon asked them to record a full-album.
On 22 May 1984, Bathory had their first and only rehearsal together before recording the album. On 14 June the band entered Heavenshore Studio in Stockholm—a garage—to record the album. The recording and mixing were done in somewhere between 32 and 56 hours.

<doc id="517640" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=517640" title="Hotepsekhemwy">
Hotepsekhemwy

Hotepsekhemwy was an early Egyptian king, the first ruler of the Second Dynasty. It is not known how long he ruled. The Turin King List has him ruling for 95 years. The Ancient Egyptian historian Manetho reports that the reign of "Boëthôs" lasted for 38 years. Egyptologists now believe Hotepsekhemwy ruled for either 25 or 29 years.
Hotepsekhemwy's name has been found at Saqqara, Giza, Badari and Abydos, on clay seal impressions, stone vessels and bone cylinders. Several stone vessel inscriptions mention Hotepsekhemwy along with the name of his successor Raneb.
The Horus name of Hotepsekhemwy may give clues to the politics of the time. The Egyptian word "Hotep" means "peaceful", "to be pleased", and also "conciliation" or "to be reconciled". So Hotepsekhemwy's full name may be read as "the two powers are reconciled" or "pleasing in powers". This suggests a significant political meaning. "The two powers" could be Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt as well as to the major deities Horus and Seth.
From the reign of Hotepsekhemwy onward it became a tradition to write the Horus name and the nebty name in the same way. The Horus name has a clearly defined, symbolic meaning in its translation. Horus- and nebty names being the same might also show, that the Horus name was used when becoming king.
The name of Hotepsekhemwy's wife is unknown. There could be a son, Perneb, who had the titles “son of the king” and “priest of Sopdu”. The clay seals with Perneb's name and titles were found in a gallery tomb which belonged to two kings equally, Hotepsekhemwy and his successor, Raneb. It is not possible to know which was his father.
Hotepsekhemwy is known from lists made at the time of Ramesses II. The name "Bedjau" is found on the Abydos king list, "Bedjatau" from Giza, "Netjer-Bau" from the Sakkara king list and the name "Bau-hetepju" is on the Turin King List. A similar name, "Bedjatau", is on a short king list found on a writing board from the mastaba tomb G1001 of the high official Mesdjeru. "Bedjatau" means "the foundryman". This is thought to be a misreading of the name "Hotepsekhemwy". The hieroglyphic signs used to write "Hotep" are very similar to the signs of a pottery kiln and a chick in hieratic writings. The signs of two "Sekhem"sceptres were misread as a leg and a drill. This kind of misreading may have happened in the case of King Khasekhemwy, where the two sceptres in the Horus name were misread as two leg-symbols or two drill-signs. The Abydos king list copies this Old Kingdom name form of “Bedjatau”. The names "Netjerbau" and "Bau-hetepju" are problematic, since Egyptologists can't find any name source from Hotepsekhemwy's time that could have been used to form them.
Little is known about Hotepsekhemwy's reign. Evidence shows he may have gained the throne after a period of political strife. During this time there were several kings who only ruled for a very short time, such as Horus "Bird" and Sneferka. Sneferka could be a name used by king Qaa for a short time. The tomb of king Qaa was robbed at the end of First dynasty, and was restored during the reign of Hotepsekhemwy. The robbing of the cemetery and the conciliatory meaning of the name Hotepsekhemwy may be clues of a dynastic struggle. The kings Sneferka and Horus “Bird” were left out of later king lists, perhaps because their struggles for the Egyptian throne led to the collapse of the first dynasty.
A new royal residence called "Horus the shining star" built for Hotepsekhemwy. He also built a temple near Buto for the god "Netjer-Achty" and founded the "Chapel of the White Crown". The white crown, the hedjet, is a symbol of Upper Egypt. This is a clue to the origin of Hotepsekhemwy's dynasty, and shows a likely source of political power. There is no mention of a Sed festival,which shows that Hotepsekhemwy cannot have ruled longer than 30 years. The Sed festival was celebrated as the anniversary for a reign of 30 years.
The ancient Egyptian historian Manetho reported that during his reign, "a chasm opened near Bubastis and many perished". Although Manetho wrote in the 3rd century BC – over two thousand years later – the story may be based on fact, as the region near Bubastis is known to be seismically active.
The location of Hotepsekhemwy's tomb is unknown. Some Egyptologists believe it could be the giant underground "Gallery Tomb B" beneath the funeral passage of the Unas-necropolis at Saqqara. Many seal impressions of king Hotepsekhemwy have been found in these galleries. Others think that "Gallery Tomb B" is the burial site of king Raneb. Several seal impressions of this ruler were also found there.

Bullet cluster

The Bullet cluster (1E 0657-558) consists of two colliding clusters of galaxies. Strictly speaking, the name "Bullet cluster" refers to the smaller subcluster, moving away from the larger one. It is at a co-moving radial distance of 1.141 x 10 parsecs (3.7 billion light-years).
Gravitational lensing studies of the Bullet cluster are claimed to provide the best evidence to date for the existence of dark matter. However, this interpretation of the gravitational lensing results is disputed. Observations of other galaxy cluster collisions, such as MACS J0025.4-1222, are similarly claimed to support the existence of dark matter.
Mordehai Milgrom, the original proposer of MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics), has posted on-line a rebuttal of claims that the Bullet Cluster proves the existence of dark matter. Milgrom claims that MOND correctly accounts for the dynamics of galaxies outside of galaxy clusters, and even in clusters such as the Bullet Cluster it removes the need for most dark matter, leaving only a factor of two which Milgrom expects to be simply unseen ordinary matter (non-luminous baryonic matter) rather than cold dark matter. Without MOND, or some similar theory, the matter discrepancy in galaxy clusters is a factor of 10, i.e. MOND reduces this discrepancy five-fold to a factor of 2.

Garden of the Sanhedrin Tombs

The Tombs of the Sanhedrin is a series of tombs in Jerusalem, Israel. The tombs are cut into the rock underground. It was named after the "Sanhedrin" - courts of judges that were chosen in every city of ancient Israel.
The cave was cleared in 1903 by the American archaeologist G. A. Burton. In 1950, archaeologist Yotam Julius Rothschild finished excavating the cave (clearing it out completely, so he could see what was inside). In the cave was a coffin with the name "Isaac" written on it. The coffin was taken to France, and today it is in the Louvre Museum in Paris.
Many burial caves were found in the Sanhedrin caves. The whole area is part of the necropolis, a very big, underground cemetery used during the Second Temple period in Jerusalem. There are a few reasons why this area in Jerusalem has so many burial caves. First, the area was used for stone quarrying - taking huge pieces of stone out of the ground to use them to build things. This left large caves. Also, at the time, rich people in Jerusalem liked the idea of burial caves. This made the idea of a necropolis easier and popular.

"Anti" became the fifth-best performing album in the US in 2016.
Rihanna tweeted that the album's lead single was "Work", featuring Canadian rapper Drake. The song ultimately reached number one on the iTunes charts of over 70 countries. "Work" has topped the "Billboard" Hot 100 for nine weeks in a row, making it the longest-running number-one single of 2016 so far. It became Rihanna's 14th and Drake's second number-one song in the United States. It also topped the charts in Canada and France, while reaching number two in the UK.
"Kiss It Better" and "Needed Me" were announced as the second and third singles from "Anti". "Kiss It Better" performed moderately on the charts, while "Needed Me" became Rihanna's 29th top-ten song in the US. It reached number seven there.
"Love on the Brain" was announced as the fourth single from "Anti". It has reached number 20 in the US. "Love on the Brain" is Rihanna's 36th top-twenty hit on the "Billboard" Hot 100.

They are placed in the care of Uncle Montgomery, but following them is a villain called Count Olaf who wants to steal their money.
Mr. Poe takes Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire to live with Montgomery Montgomery ("Uncle Monty"). He is a nice person and he works with snakes. He gives the children a bedroom each, and shows them the "Reptile Room". Made of glass, it is filled with snakes and reptiles. At the end of the room is a library. The children are very happy living with Uncle Monty.
The children are going to Peru in a few days with Uncle Monty. One day, he says his assistant will be coming. His assistant Stephano is really Count Olaf in disguise: he has covered his ankle tattoo and shaved off his eyebrow. Count Olaf kills Uncle Monty.
Olaf wants to take the children to Peru, where he can steal their money easily. When he is taking the children to a ferry in his car, it crashes into Mr. Poe's car. The Baudelaires try to tell Mr. Poe that this man is Olaf, but he does not believe them. They go back to Monty's house and look at his body; there are two bite marks in his face. A doctor called "Lucafont" comes and tells them Montgomery died of snakebite, but Violet looks in Olaf's luggage and finds evidence that Olaf killed Monty. She tells Mr. Poe but Olaf runs away.
"Publishers Weekly" said: "Luckily for fans"..." readers eager for more misfortune can turn to The Reptile Room, for an even more suspenseful tale". It has elegant "drawings of Gothic gargoyles and mischievous eyes" to illustrate the story.

The Last Voyage of the Starship Enterprise

"The Last Voyage of the Starship Enterprise" is a comedy routine. It was first shown during episode 22 of the first season of "Saturday Night Live" on May 29, 1976. The routine is twelve minutes long. It was written by Michael O'Donoghue consulting with actor John Belushi. They included a realistic model of the "USS Enterprise" bridge from the TV show "Star Trek". Dress rehearsal was hard. The writer was not sure if Belushi would be able to do a good parody of William Shatner's performance as Captain Kirk. The routine was a success. O'Donoghue immediately congratulated Belushi after his performance.
The sketch became an instant classic hit among "Star Trek" fans and science fiction fans. The 1977 book "Saturday Night Live" included a copy of a note from "Star Trek" creator Gene Roddenberry where he called the comedic bit "delicious". The routine was released on a 1985 "Saturday Night Live" videotape that combined "The Best of John Belushi". It was released again with the same title in DVD format in 2011.
In his book "Metapop", author Michael Dunne called the comedic bit one of the most famous scenes from "Saturday Night Live". The "Chicago Sun-Times" called it a really intelligent parody of "Star Trek". "Huffpost TV" called it one of "the most famous parodies" of "Star Trek". "The A.V. Club" said the sketch was really well-done comedy.
"The New Yorker" movie critic Anthony Lane wrote that Belushi did a perfect acting job. "The Hollywood Reporter" interviewed Tom Hanks and Elliott Gould in 2015. Gould called the sketch a favorite. Hanks said it was one of the top five best of all time. "Rolling Stone" ranked every "Saturday Night Live" cast member by talent in 2015, and John Belushi was placed at number one. "Rolling Stone" said the Captain Kirk parody was one of Belushi's best.

UML diagram

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering, that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.
UML was originally motivated by the desire to standardize the disparate notational systems and approaches to software design developed by Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson and James Rumbaugh at Rational Software in 1994–95, with further development led by them through 1996.
In 1997 UML was adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG), and has been managed by this organization ever since. In 2005 the Unified Modeling Language was also published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as an approved ISO standard. Since then it has been periodically revised to cover the latest revision of UML.
Though well-known and widely used in education and academic papers, as of 2013 UML is little-used in industry, and most such use is informal and ad hoc.
 [hide] 
History of object-oriented methods and notation
UML has been evolving since the second half of the 1990s and has its roots in the object-oriented methods developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The timeline (see image) shows the highlights of the history of object-oriented modeling methods and notation.
It is originally based on the notations of the Booch method, the Object-modeling technique (OMT) and Object-oriented software engineering (OOSE), which it has integrated into a single language.
Rational Software Corporation hired James Rumbaugh from General Electric in 1994 and after that the company became the source for two of the most popular object-oriented modeling approaches of the day: Rumbaugh's Object-modeling technique (OMT) and Grady Booch's method. They were soon assisted in their efforts by Ivar Jacobson, the creator of theobject-oriented software engineering (OOSE) method, who joined them at Rational in 1995.
Under the technical leadership of those three (Rumbaugh, Jacobson and Booch), a consortium called the UML Partnerswas organized in 1996 to complete the "Unified Modeling Language (UML)" specification, and propose it to the Object Management Group (OMG) for standardisation. The partnership also contained additional interested parties (for example HP, DEC, IBM and Microsoft). The UML Partners' UML 1.0 draft was proposed to the OMG in January 1997 by the consortium. During the same month the UML Partners formed a group, designed to define the exact meaning of language constructs, chaired by Cris Kobryn and administered by Ed Eykholt, to finalize the specification and integrate it with other standardization efforts. The result of this work, UML 1.1, was submitted to the OMG in August 1997 and adopted by the OMG in November 1997.
After the first release a task force was formed to improve the language, which released several minor revisions, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5.
The standards it produced (as well as the original standard) have been noted as being ambiguous and inconsistent.
The UML 2.0 major revision replaced version 1.5 in 2005, which was developed with an enlarged consortium to improve the language further to reflect new experience on usage of its features.
Although UML 2.1 was never released as a formal specification, versions 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 appeared in 2007, followed by UML 2.2 in February 2009. UML 2.3 was formally released in May 2010. UML 2.4.1 was formally released in August 2011. UML 2.5 was released in October 2012 as an "In process" version and was officially released in June 2015.
There are four parts to the UML 2.x specification:
The current versions of these standards follow: UML Superstructure version 2.4.1, UML Infrastructure version 2.4.1, OCL version 2.3.1, and UML Diagram Interchange version 1.0. It continues to be updated and improved by the revision task force, who resolve any issues with the language.
The Unified Modeling Language (UML) offers a way to visualize a system's architectural blueprints in a diagram (see image), including elements such as:
Although originally intended solely for object-oriented design documentation, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) has been extended to cover a larger set of design documentation (as listed above), and been found useful in many contexts.
UML is not a development method by itself; however, it was designed to be compatible with the leading object-oriented software development methods of its time (for exampleOMT, Booch method, Objectory) and especially with RUP that it was originally intended to be used when work began at Rational Software Inc.
It is important to distinguish between the UML model and the set of diagrams of a system. A diagram is a partial graphic representation of a system's model. The set of diagrams need not completely cover the model and deleting a diagram does not change the model. The model may also contain documentation that drives the model elements and diagrams (such as written use cases).
UML diagrams represent two different views of a system model:
UML models can be exchanged among UML tools by using the XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) interchange format.
UML 2 has many types of diagrams which are divided into two categories. Some types represent "structural" information, and the rest represent general types of "behavior", including a few that represent different aspects of "interactions". These diagrams can be categorized hierarchically as shown in the following class diagram:
These diagrams may all contain comments or notes explaining usage, constraint, or intent.
Structure diagrams emphasize the things that must be present in the system being modeled. Since structure diagrams represent the structure, they are used extensively in documenting the software architecture of software systems. For example, the component diagram which describes how a software system is split up into components and shows the dependencies among these components.
Behavior diagrams emphasize what must happen in the system being modeled. Since behavior diagrams illustrate the behavior of a system, they are used extensively to describe the functionality of software systems. As an example, the activity diagram describes the business and operational step-by-step activities of the components in a system.
Interaction diagrams, a subset of behavior diagrams, emphasize the flow of control and data among the things in the system being modeled. For example, the sequence diagramwhich shows how objects communicate with each other in terms of a sequence of messages.
Main article: Meta-Object Facility
Illustration of the Meta-Object Facility
The Object Management Group (OMG) has developed a metamodeling architecture to define the Unified Modeling Language (UML), called the Meta-Object Facility (MOF). The Meta-Object Facility is designed as a four-layered architecture, as shown in the image at right. It provides a meta-meta model at the top layer, called the M3 layer. This M3-model is the language used by Meta-Object Facility to build metamodels, called M2-models.
The most prominent example of a Layer 2 Meta-Object Facility model is the UML metamodel, the model that describes the UML itself. These M2-models describe elements of the M1-layer, and thus M1-models. These would be, for example, models written in UML. The last layer is the M0-layer or data layer. It is used to describe runtime instances of the system.
The meta-model can be extended using a mechanism which is called stereotyping. This has been criticised as being insufficient/untenable by Brian Henderson-Sellers and Cesar Gonzalez-Perez in "Uses and Abuses of the Stereotype Mechanism in UML 1.x and 2.0".
UML has been found useful in many design contexts, so much so that is has become all but ubiquitous within the IT community.
It has been treated, at times, as a design silver bullet, which has led to problems in its usage. Misuse of it includes excessive usage of it (design every little part of the system'scode with it, which is unnecessary) and assuming that anyone can design anything with it (even those who haven't programmed).
It is seen to be a large language, with many constructs in it. Some (including Jacobson) feel that there are too many and that this hinders the learning (and therefore usage) of it.
Common criticisms of UML from industry include:

An editor recently renamed some (but not all) Chicago-related categories to include ", Illinois" in the names. This raises the question, do we want categories for US settlements to include the name of the state or territory in their names? The reasoning for article names has been that it is not needed if there is no ambiguity, or if the place in question is the primary meaning of the name. Should we use the same reasoning for categories? -- () 01:07, 31 August 2015 (UTC)
OK, I was waiting for others to give their opinions, but here is another point. The issue for categories is different from the issue for articles. Take the case of Madrid: there's the big one in Spain and there are several others. Someone could type in "Madrid" when looking for an article on one of the others. When they arrive at the Spanish one, they will soon see that the article isn't about the one they want (because the article talks about Spain), and they can look further. If they're looking at a "category" for one of the others, they may find the category for the Spanish one, but not realize it isn't what they want -- not everyone would look at how the category is categorized. If they are actually categorizing something, they may add the category "Madrid", see that the category exists, and not check further. To sum up, we could make a case for always including the country, state, etc. in categories. -- () 18:04, 5 September 2015 (UTC)

It becomes "I Don't Like It", and I have to privileges to delete it, so I will. We can do better than that. -- () 18:32, 17 October 2015 (UTC)

Certain aspects or articles of this simple wikipedia are quite long, with a large amount of words, and indexes. Just wondering people's thoughts on this. 
Login details for millions of accounts from plenty of security/data breaches over the past few years have been made public for quite some time already. A list (not exhaustive!) is available here. Now would be a good time for all editors (especially functionaries, i.e. editors holding advanced user rights) to change their password. If you use the same password across multiple websites including Wikipedia, your account may have already been compromised.
If an obvious account compromise is detected, the account will be blocked. As for functionaries, local bureaucrats have the technical ability to remove sysop from editors and will not hesitate to do so in the event of an obvious account compromise, and/or enlist the assistance of stewards.
For those who would like to know more, the full story is available .     11:40, 4 November 2015 (UTC)

While trying to find a definitive list of words considered "simple" I found multiple overlapping lists that include obvious omissions and also include words that seem dated, at best. I am referring to the original list of 850 or so basic English words plus the various extensions and addendums, as listed here. This page is referenced on the main landing page, and does not explain how "basic English" is different from "simple English". I am proposing that a master list of simple English words be compiled and published as an . This would not be a single-source list (that cannot or should not be changed), but rather a "consensus-based" list of words that are appropriate for this project, that can be amended or extended in the future, and that do not need additional explanation when used. This would include the original list or lists of words plus common forms of those words (such as plurals of singular nouns, different verb forms, etc.). Such a list would not be an article, subject to the usual rules for citing sources, but once complete, those who propose that specific words be added should be prepared to justify the addition with something beyond their own belief that the word is simple. Finally, the list should be just that: a list. There should not be any explanatory comments, alphabetical section headers, etc. The idea is to make a list that can be copied and pasted and not need additional formatting or cleanup to be used for other purposes.  | |   02:46, 16 November 2015 (UTC)
Two mistakes, one grammatical and one substantive:
I've boldly added the "talk quotation" template that is used on En-Wiki. It was copied verbatim and the diff is referred to in the comments section. Documentation was also copied over and attributed in the same way. For those unfamiliar with it's use, this template is intended for talk and project pages, and is used when quoting another editor during a conversation. For example, if I write, the result is . It is especially useful when quoting someone from a ways up the page on a long discussion, or when quoting policy, but it's use is not restricted on En-Wiki to these purposes. It is restricted to talk pages and project pages, however, so don't try to use it within articles.  | |   11:37, 18 November 2015 (UTC)

Sometimes it is hard to guess the correct pronunciation(s) for a title of an article. I am a non-native speaker, and I have never heard the English pronunciation of the word Constantinople, for example. So I would be grateful if I could know the correct pronunciation without leaving an article when I am reading it (and sometimes reading it aloud). I wrote "every" in the title. But of course I am not much in need for pronunciation guides in articles like Red or Dog. Even so, if there is IPA or audio or even where (which syllable) to pronounce strongly in every article, it would be very helpful. That is, Rock and Sea are OK, it begins to be complicated in River and Flower, and in Earthquake we get really lost. I imagine it as "ree-vuh-r or rah-ee-vuh-r?" and "f-low-r? fl-au-r?" and finally, "ee-r-...th? the? -kyoo-ah-kee...?" (Maybe because of "ear," "smooth," "Q" and "catastrophe," respectively.) 
Also I would like a lot of . That is because to hear the correct sounds of English is the only way to make them correctly on my own. I need more spoken articles on Simple English Wikipedia than on English Wikipedia. I think that spoken audio of any article of any subject will be helpful if the sound is clear and the person speaks clearly and loudly. 
Lastly, I tried to write the sentences above as simple as I could with my own English knowledge. I hope there is nothing ambiguous or rude there. I appreciate if you tell me when you find it.-- () 07:11, 23 November 2015 (UTC)

Hi everyone,
This is to inform all Wikimedia contributors that a has just been started on Meta-Wiki.

An exemplary and an have now been prepared, and translated into about half a dozen languages by volunteer translators.
We are seeking if the global Wikimedia community approves starting a banner campaign asking Wikipedia readers to call on the Syrian government to release Bassel from prison. We understand that a campaign like this would be unprecedented in Wikipedia's history, which is why we're seeking the widest possible consensus among the community.
Given Bassel's urgent situation and the resulting tight schedule, we ask everyone to to the widest possible extent, and to promote it among your communities as soon as possible.
Thank you for your participation!

The Land of Gorch

The Land of Gorch is a series of stories in episodes from the first season of the comedy television show "Saturday Night Live". It was special because it included Jim Henson's Muppets. Before he worked on "Sesame Street", Henson had made his puppet characters for a more adult audience, including his show "Sam and Friends". His characters were regular appearances on the late-night-comedy television shows including "The Ed Sullivan Show". After "Sesame Street", Henson was afraid that he would only be able to get work in the future on children's television series. His friend and advisor Bernie Brillstein, who also represented Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, and John Belushi, helped him move over from his prior work to "Saturday Night Live". 
The idea behind "The Land of Gorch" was that it had Muppet characters in a far-away place, who were members of a royal family. They behaved rudely, with many references to drug abuse, sex, and drinking alcohol. Characters included King Ploobis and Queen Peutra and children, and servants Scred and Vazh. These characters often spoke to their wise prophet Mighty Favog for advice.
The staff of "Saturday Night Live" disagreed with Henson's ideas. Writers Michael O'Donoghue, Alan Zweibel, and Al Franken often tried to avoid writing the weekly sketches involving "The Land of Gorch". Henson felt they were trying to write for situational comedy and were not keeping true to his own ideas. Frank Oz agreed in the end that the match was not perfect between "Saturday Night Live" and "The Land of Gorch", and was thankful that by the end of the year he and Henson were able to move on to "The Muppet Show".
"The Land of Gorch" influenced many later creations by Jim Henson. His feature film "The Dark Crystal" used both puppetry techniques and story ideas from the sketches. The Jim Henson Company television show "Dinosaurs" later contained similar story ideas previously seen in "The Land of Gorch", including a plot-line about environmentalism. 
Commentators talking about "The Land of Gorch" agreed that the reception was bad — "The A.V. Club" wrote that it became an open joke between the staff that no one wanted to continue having the sketches on "Saturday Night Live". "San Francisco Chronicle" called the characters the opposite of Kermit the Frog, and compared them to trolls. "DVD Talk" called the feature the worst mistake made in the first season of the "Saturday Night Live". "Vogue" described the characters as early versions of Muppets and the world they inhabited as quite dark. Academic Michael J. Bernsten wrote in his essay "The Muppetry of Nightmares" that the idea failed because the characters were not funny and did not have strong values.

Plant hormone

Plant hormones (or Phytohormones) are chemicals that regulate plant growth. In the UK they are called 'plant growth substances'. The best known plant hormone is auxin.
Plant hormones are signal molecules produced within the plant. They occur in extremely low concentrations. Hormones regulate cellular processes in targeted cells. Hormones also govern the formation of flowers, stems, leaves, the shedding of leaves, and the development and ripening of fruit. 
Plants, unlike animals, lack glands that produce and secrete hormones. Individual cells can produce hormones. They affect which tissues grow upward and which grow downward, leaf formation and stem growth, fruit development and ripening, plant longevity, and even plant death. Hormones are vital to plant growth, and, lacking them, plants would be mostly a mass of undifferentiated cells. So they are also known as growth factors or growth hormones. 
Phytohormones are found not only in higher plants, but in algae too, with similar functions. They also occur in fungi and bacteria, where they may be used to induce beneficial reactions in host plants.

Auxin

Auxins are a class of plant hormones (or plant growth substances) with some morphogen-like characteristics. Auxins have a main role in coordination of many growth and behavioral processes in the plant's life cycle. they are essential for plant body development. 
Auxins and their role in plant growth were first described by the Dutch scientist Frits Warmolt Went. Kenneth V. Thimann isolated auxin and found its chemical structure to be indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Went and Thimann co-authored a book on plant hormones, "Phytohormones", in 1937.
There are synthetic auxins, and in big doses they can be used as herbicides. Agent Orange is a mixture of synthetic auxins.

Release (music)

In the music industry, a release usually is a creative output from an artist available for sale or distribution. It is a broad term covering the many different forms music can be released in. Music can be released as singles, extended plays or as albums. A popular medium for releases is the Compact Disc (CD).
Musical performers often self-release (self-publish) their recordings without the involvement of an established record label. Some artists or groups who enjoy local or small scale popularity have started their own labels in order to release their music. Others simply sell the music directly to customers. One example is when it is sold at their live concerts. With the growth of the Internet, many musical acts have sold their recordings over the Internet without a record label. Unlike self-publishing a novel, which usually means that publishers did not want to publish it, even well-known musicians will choose to self-release recordings. Music managers are increasingly getting involved in music releases.
The word can also mean the event at which an album or single is first offered for sale. A release is sometimes called an album launch, or single launch.

Help:Why was my page deleted?

First, do not take offense if a page you submitted was deleted. Most publishers (and Wikipedia is a publisher)
maintain the right to reject articles that for some reason do not fit their purposes. Keep in mind, Simple English is a separate and unique Wikipedia project with its own guidelines and policies. While in some ways it is similar to the larger English Wikipedia, it is not the same. Many editors here have had articles deleted before and most see it as a learning experience. C. S. Lewis, the author of The Chronicles of Narnia (and over 30 other books) had his work rejected over "800 times" before he published a single piece of writing! The important thing is if you feel an article you submitted has merit, find out why it was deleted, correct the problem(s) and resubmit the article. You may want to ask another editor for help. While Simplewiki is a small community and most editors are kept very busy with work of their own, most will take the time to help new editors who have questions or would like to know how to do something. Remember, this is about the article, not the editor. 
Pages and media in all namespaces that satisfy certain criteria are candidates. This means that administrators can delete them immediately and without discussion. The criteria include, among others, s, , and , , , or are obvious advertising (of any kind). Additional criteria includes articles that are deemed too short or which have little meaning, articles that have no content and those which are not written in English. Articles in certain areas that do not claim of the subject may be Quick deleted. Articles that have been copied and pasted from another Wikipedia without simplifying complex text may be Quick deleted (see ). For more information see . 
Administrators often leave short codes in the deletion summary instead of typing out a full reason. Examples are (), () or (is very short and provides little or no meaning). You may also ask an administrator why a page was deleted. Another place to look is . If you know the date it was deleted you can scroll down the list to find out who deleted it and why. You can also search the log if you do not know the date.
In addition to deleting, certain subjects may be redirected to an existing article based on community consensus. An example is music albums which do not claim notability. If the artist's page exist, an album article may be redirected to that page. Any redirected page may later be expanded into an article, providing it meets the applicable guidelines.
Under Wikipedia's deletion policy, certain pages do not qualify for QD (Quick Deletion) and must go though the process. This allows seven days for discussion. Each participating editor gives an opinion whether to delete, keep, or make other suggestions, and a give a short reason. This should not be considered a vote. Also be aware that (creating another account to appear to be a different user) for the purposes of adding comments in favor of one action or another is not allowed. An administrator closes the discussion after seven days. The editors' comments are then taken into consideration when the decision is made. If there are no comments in seven days an administrator may close the discussion and delete the page.
Actually, no it isn't. None of the information on a "deleted" page has actually been lost. You can request a . The request should include a "good reason". A redirected page (see ) has a history which contains the original article. This allows a user to copy the original page to their and improve it. 
Is it unfair for an editor to simply submit something knowing it does not meet WP guidelines and expect other editors to fix or improve it. Very few editors have the time (or interest) in just improving pages. Editors here are volunteers and work in their own areas of interest. Many stubs have been submitted since this project started and many of these remain stubs years after their submission. If the submitting editor does not do what he or she sees needs doing, it may not get done. In short, there is no George.

In typography, a typeface is a family of fonts. Every glyph in a typeface shares certain design features. Typefaces have names, such as "Times New Roman", "Garamond", "Baskerville", and so on.
Every font of a typeface has specific details (such as size and weight) and is used in a particular way. The reason for having different fonts is to give the designer or printer choices which suit various needs. The most basic of all needs is to have the text legible and readable.
There are many versions of typefaces which are out of copyright. "ITC Garamond" is a different typeface from "Adobe Garamond" or "Monotype Garamond". These are all versions of the typeface Garamond, originally created in the 16th century.
There are thousands of different typefaces in existence, with new ones being developed constantly.
The art and craft of designing typefaces is called "type design". In digital typography, type designers are sometimes also called "font developers" or "font designers".
Every typeface is a collection of glyphs, each of which represents an individual letter, number, punctuation mark, or other symbol. There are typefaces tailored for special applications, such as map-making or astrology and mathematics.
A very widely used typeface is "Times New Roman". This is a serif typeface commissioned by the British newspaper "The Times" in 1931. This typeface was later adapted for use in book printing, and again for use as a computer face. There are now many different versions of this typeface.

At first it was spoken only by what Indians refer to as "ABCDs" (American-Born Confused Desi). Now it is spoken by about 350 million speakers. It is heard on television and in advertisements in India. Coca-Cola's ad in Hinglish is "Life ho to aisi" (Life should be like this). Pepsi's ad is "Yeh Dil Maange More" (the heart wants more). Domino's Pizza asks "Hungry kya?" (Are you hungry?). It has become a hybrid language many Indians speak naturally and without giving it any thought. 
The first book written in Hinglish, "All we need is Love", is by Richa Devesar. It was published in March of 2015.

It was discovered by the Stonehenge Riverside Project about south-east of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, England. All that remains of the site is the ditch of the henge and a series of stone settings, none of which is visible above ground.
Excavation revealed two flint chisel arrowheads in a style commonly used during 3400-2500 BC. The stones have been put up in that period. It is estimated that there may have been as many as 27 stones in a circle 33 feet (10 m) wide.
The site was excavated in August 2008 and again in August 2009. It is considered an important find by archaeologists.
The name "Bluestonehenge" is from the small stone chips found in some of the stone settings. These bluestones are also found in Stonehenge and consist of a wide range of rock types originally from Pembrokeshire West Wales, some away. Archaeologists think any bluestones in the circle may have been removed around 2500 BC and used at Stonehenge, which had major rebuilding at about that time.
The stone circle settings were surrounded by a henge, comprising an ditch and outer bank which appears to date from approximately 2400 BC.

In Norse mythology, Gleipnir was the third chain used to tie up Fenrir, the wolf. Fenrir was the son of Loki and Angrboða, the giantess. The first two chains, named Lædingr and Dromi, were forged by Thor and did not hold him. Gleipnir was created by the sons of Ivaldi and did hold Fenrir. It was as thin as spider's silk. Gleipnir was made from six things: 
The gods lured Fenrir to the island of Lyngvi. They challenged him to be bound by Gleipnir. To show Fenrir it was no trick, Týr put his hand in Fenrir's mouth. When he could not break Gleipnir's grip on him Fenrir bit off Týr's hand. Fenrir was to remain bound by Gleipnir until Ragnarök (the final great battle of the gods).

End zone

The end zone refers to the scoring area on the field, according to gridiron-based codes of football. It is the area between the end line and goal line bounded by the sidelines. There are two end zones. Each one is on an opposite side of the field. It is bordered on all sides by a white line indicating its beginning and end points. Usually padded orange square markers are placed at each of the four corners as a visual aid. Canadian rule books use the terms "goal area" and "dead line" instead of "end zone" and "end line" respectively. But the latter terms are the more common in Canadian English. In American football the end zone is 10 yards deep. Canadian football end zones are 20 yards; 10 yards deeper than those in American football. Sports like association football and ice hockey require the puck or ball to pass completely over the goal line to count as a score. Canadian and American football merely need the nose of the ball to break the vertical plane of the outer edge of the goal line.

Red-and-green macaw

The red-and-green macaw ("Ara chloropterus"), is a large mostly-red macaw of the "Ara" genus. This is the largest bird of the "Ara" genus. It is commonly found in the forests and woodlands of northern and central South America. They are found in flocks of 30 or more birds in the lowland areas. On forested slopes they form smaller flocks of two to three pairs. The flock roosts in trees at night. During the day they fly long distances to find fruit and seeds to eat. They spend a good part of the day resting, noisily arguing among themselves. Like other macaws, in recent years there has been a decline in its numbers due to habitat loss. They are hunted for food, feathers or are illegally captured for the parrot trade.

Dither fish

Dither fish are aquarium fish used by cichlid owners to make some species of cichlids less timid. 
Dither fish usually swim around the top of a tank. This behavior encourages more timid fish to relax and venture out more. The timid fish think (correctly) that no predators are around. 
The technique relies on the ability of cichlids in an aquarium to use the behaviour of other fish species as a sign that the environment is safe. Good dither fish are typically schooling species, such as some "Danio" species, barbs and some tetra species.

Burning of Parliament

The Burning of Parliament was a great fire in London on 16 October 1834. The Palace of Westminster, the medieval royal palace used as the home of the British parliament, was largely destroyed. The blaze was caused by the burning of small wooden tally sticks. They had been used as part of the accounting procedures of the Exchequer until 1826. The sticks were disposed of in a careless manner. They were thrown in the two furnaces under the House of Lords, which caused a chimney fire in the two flues that ran under the floor of the Lords' chamber. The fire smoldered under the floor for most of the day. The senile housekeeper and a careless Clerk of Works ignored all the warning signs of the pending disaster. This led the Prime Minister to call it "one of the greatest instances of stupidity upon record". 
The fire spread rapidly throughout the buildings. It became the worst fire to occur in London between the Great Fire of 1666 and the Blitz of the Second World War. the event attracted large crowds which included several artists who provided pictorial records of the event. The fire lasted for most of the night. The House of Lords and the House of Commons were destroyed along with most of their libraries, art collections and records.

Like Imageepoch's earlier game series "", "Stella Gow" is tactical role-playing game where the player moves characters under his or her control on a grid and fight against an opposing team of characters or creatures. The battle grid possesses varied elevations and is presented from a top-down .
Witch characters possess "song magic", which they use in combat. Before a witch's song magic can be used, it must first be unlocked by the player. The player must enter a witch and defeat a boss creature inside.
Players also have access to "Free Time", which they have use to speak to characters, partake in jobs in order to earn money, enhance the skills of witches via "tuning", or search the city for items. Partaking in these activities costs "action points", and players only have access to three action points to spend during each "Free Time" session. other activities, such as buying equipment and "orbs" for characters, do not cost action points.
"Stella Glow" takes place in a world with song-driven magic. This song magic brought prosperity to the world, but in turn, this prosperity also brought problems and war to the world. God then took song magic away from the people. Thousands of years later, song magic reappeared in the hands of five witches. One of these witches is Hilda, who wishes to crystallize the world and leads the Harbingers. Opposing her are the Regnant Knights and the four other witches.
Alto is the main protagonist and a resident of Mithra, along with Lisette. When Mithra is crystallized, Alto joined Regnant Knights in order to undo the damage done to his home.

Edward the Exile

Edward the Exile (1016 – late August 1057), also called Edward Ætheling, was the son of King Edmund Ironside and of Ealdgyth. He spent most of his life in exile following the defeat and death of his father by Canute.
After the Danish conquest of England in 1016, Canute had Edward and his brother, Edmund, sent to the Swedish court of Olof Skötkonung. Edward was a baby at the time. Canute's agents apparently had orders to have the children murdered. But they were quickly taken to Hungary where neither Canut or his agents could reach them. He was brought up at the Hungarian court. Edward married Agatha, a relative of Emperor Henry II. 
Edward the Confessor, King of England, had no children. Edward, his nephew, was his nearest living relative. The King wanted to make Edward his heir. In 1057, the king's messengers reached Edward living in Hungary. Edward agreed to return to England and in 1057 arrived in London with his family. But a few days after their arrival Edward was killed.
He and Agatha had three children, Edgar the Atheling, Margaret of Scotland and Cristina, Abbess of Romsey Abbey. In the summer of 1068 his son Edgar took his mother and sisters and escaped to Scotland.

Presumption of innocence

The presumption of innocence, is sometimes referred to by the Latin expression Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat (the burden of proof is on the one who declares, not on one who denies). It is the principle that one is considered innocent unless proven guilty. In many nations, presumption of innocence is a legal right of the accused in a criminal trial. It is also regarded as an international human right under the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 11. and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 14. This places the burden of proof on the prosecution. They have to collect and present enough compelling evidence to convince the trier of fact (a jury or judge) that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt. If reasonable doubt remains, the accused is to be ted. Under Justinian Codes and English Common law, the accused is presumed innocent in criminal proceedings. In civil proceedings (like breach of contract) both sides must issue proof. Under Anglo-American Common Law, the accused is always presumed innocent in all types of proceedings. Proof is always the of the accuser. Sharia law, also called Islamic Law, is the third most common type of law in the world. It also has a presumption of innocence.

Greatest Love of All

"The Greatest Love of All" is a song written by Michael Masser and Linda Creed and originally recorded by George Benson for the 1977 Muhammad Ali biopic "The Greatest". (A live version by Benson appears on 1978's Weekend in L.A.). The song was also recorded in 1979 by Shirley Bassey, for her album "The Magic is You".
The song was further popularized by Whitney Houston under the title "Greatest Love of All". The song was recorded by the American recording artist for her debut album, self-titled "Whitney Houston", which was released in February 1985, by Arista Records.
Creed wrote the lyrics in the midst of her struggle with breast cancer. The words describe her feelings about coping with great challenges that one must face in life, being strong during those challenges whether you succeed or fail, and passing that strength on to children to carry with them into their adult lives. Creed eventually succumbed to the disease in April 1986 at the age of 37; at the time her song was an international hit by Houston.
The song became a major hit, topping the charts in Australia, Canada and the US, while reaching the top 20 in most countries, including Italy, Sweden and UK. It remains her third biggest US hit, after "I Will Always Love You" and "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)". All three songs, in order of their former popularity, re-entered the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, after Houston's death, debuting the same week at numbers 7, 35 and 41, respectively, giving Houston three posthumous chart hits.
Clive Davis, founder of Houston's label Arista Records, was initially against Houston recording the song for her debut studio album, "Whitney Houston", but he eventually gave in after persuasion from Houston and Masser. It was released as the B-side to the single "You Give Good Love", a previous Top 5 hit by Houston. The song was eventually released as a single in its own right. The song, released in January 28, 1986, was the seventh release from Houston's debut album, and spent three weeks at No. 1 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in May of that year.
Houston's album version features a piano intro, while the single version begins with a keyboard intro. After the single became a success, it replaced the original album version on subsequent pressings of the album. However, the original version was restored for the 2010 Deluxe Anniversary Edition reissue of the album.

Legal burden of proof

The burden of proof () in the United States is a level of proof that a party seeking to prove a fact must reach before it is accepted in a court of law. The Latin saying is "semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit". It means: "the necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays charges." 
In a criminal case the burden of proof is on the prosecution. A defendant is not required to prove his or her innocence. The standard the prosecution must reach is proof of their version of the facts beyond a reasonable doubt. In a civil trial the burden of proof is on the one bringing the case to court, called the plaintiff. In a civil trial the burden of proof is on the plaintiff. The standard that must be met is that the "preponderance of the evidence" (weight of the evidence) is enough to prove their case. 
If a defendant in a civil or criminal case wants to provide an alternative set of facts to those provided by the prosecution or the plaintiff, this is called an "affirmative defense". This shifts the burden of proof to the defendant to prove his or her version of the facts. The defendant seek to to excuse or justify his or her actions that brought the lawsuit. Common affirmative defenses include entrapment, Self-defense, unclean hands, insanity, and the statute of limitations.
Preponderance of the evidence, also known as the "balance of probabilities" is the standard required in most civil cases. It is also used in family court for determinations solely involving money, such as child support under the Child Support Standards Act.
The standard is met if the proposition is more likely to be true than not true. The standard is satisfied if there is greater than fifty percent chance that the proposition is true. Lord Denning, in "Miller v. Minister of Pensions", described it simply as "more probable than not." Until 1970, this was also the standard used in juvenile court in the United States. This is a far lower burden than "beyond a reasonable doubt," the threshold a prosecutor must meet in criminal trials.
This is the highest standard used as the burden of proof in common law countries. It usually only applies in criminal proceedings. If there is a real doubt, based upon reason and common sense after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence (or lack of evidence) in a case, then the level of proof has not been met. If the jury, or judge in a bench trial, has no doubt as to the defendant's guilt, or if their only doubts are unreasonable doubts, then the prosecutor has proved the defendant is guilty.

In Economics, a public good is a kind of common good. Public goods have two main properties:
Examples for public goods are fresh air, knowledge, street lighting, or a fireworks display.
Public goods are an example of market failure: If all actors maximize their gain, this does not produce an efficient solution. 
It is obvious that because the goods are non-excludable, it means that a producer sees no benefit in producing or providing the good on the market, this is because it is impossible to make a profit from it as people who have not paid for the good. For this reason, the government may intervene to provide it. There are relatively few examples of "purely" public goods, however some examples are:
The reason that the government feels the need to provide these goods is because the Marginal Social Benefit is greater than the Marginal Private Benefit, and so because there are positive externalities in consumption, it will always be under consumed in the market mechanism,

Corona

A corona is an aura of plasma which surrounds the sun and other stars. The Sun's corona extends millions of kilometres into space and is most easily seen during a total solar eclipse. It is also observable with a device called a coronagraph. The word "corona" is a Latin word meaning "crown", from the Ancient Greek κορώνη (korōnē, “garland, wreath”).
The Sun's corona is much hotter (by a factor from 150 to 450) than the visible surface of the Sun. The photosphere's average temperature is 5800 kelvin compared to the corona's one to three million kelvin. The corona is 10 times as dense as the photosphere, and so produces about one-millionth as much visible light. The corona is separated from the photosphere by the relatively shallow chromosphere. The exact mechanism by which the corona is heated is still the subject of some debate. The outer edges of the Sun's corona are constantly being bloen away by the open magnetic flux generating the solar wind.

Ex post facto law

An "ex post facto" law (Latin for "after the fact" or "from after the action") is a law that changes the legal consequences (or status) of actions that were committed before the law went into effect. In criminal law, it may criminalize actions that were legal at the time they were committed. An "ex post facto" law may make a crime worse by bringing it into a more severe category than it was in when it was committed. 
It may make the punishment prescribed for a crime, more severe. It may also add new penalties or it may extend a sentence. It may change the rules of evidence in order to make conviction for a crime likelier than it would have been when the deed was committed. , a form of "ex post facto" law, commonly called an "amnesty law", may certain acts. A pardon has a similar effect in a specific case. Other legal changes may lessen or eliminate possible punishments (for example by replacing the death sentence with lifelong imprisonment) ly. Such legal changes are also known by the Latin term in mitius.
The United States Constitution s "ex post facto" laws. Two clauses in the constitution prohibit "ex post facto". Article 1 Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution states: 'No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed,'. Section 10 says: 'No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law. . .' 
"Ex post facto" laws relate only to criminal laws passed by legislations. It does not apply to civil laws "that affect private rights adversely." In 2003 the US Supreme court noted the difference between civil and penal laws. In the case of Smith v. Doe, the court questioned the constitutionality of the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act's retroactive requirements. Alaska's Megan's Law was applied to sex offenders before the law went into effect. It required offenders to register with the local police. It also required public notification via the Internet. The court made a legal precedent in deciding the intent of the law was civil and non-punitive. That it was to protect the public saftey by "protecting the public from sex offenders."
The European Parliament prohibits "ex post facto" legislation by all member nations. They determined ""Ex post facto" legislation may also violate citizens’ right to effective legal redress and a fair trial..."
In English law, "ex post facto" laws are very rare. One example was the War Crimes Act 1991 by the Parliament of England. It allowed British citizens to be put on trial for war crimes that took place during World War II.

Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire

Between 1519 and 1521, Spanish conquistadors, led by Hernán Cortés, took over the Aztec Empire. This event is called the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. It was one of the most important events in the Spanish colonization of the Americas.
The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire was devastating to the Aztec people. By 1680, 94% of the Aztec population had died.
In 1515, two of the states in the Aztec Empire rebelled. This was nothing new for the Aztecs. However, this time, the rebelling states beat the Aztec military badly.
Then, in 1517, Spanish conquistadors, led by Cortés, arrived in Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire. At first, Motecuhzoma II, the Aztecs' ruler, invited the Spanish into Tenochtitlan, and things were friendly. Even when the Spanish made Motecuhzoma II a prisoner, the Aztecs stayed friendly.
However, soon, while Cortés was away, Spanish soldiers attacked and killed many Aztecs during a festival. When Cortés got back, he got Motecuhzoma II to tell the Aztecs to stop fighting the conquistadors. By this time, though, the Aztecs had made Motecuhzoma II's brother, Cuautemoc, the king. Nobody did what Motecuhzoma II said. They kept fighting the conquistadors, and they killed two out of every three Spanish soldiers. The Spanish survivors fled to Tlaxcala, where enemies of the Aztecs protected them.
Ten months later, Cortés came back to Tenochtitlan with more Spanish soldiers but mostly Tlaxcaltecas. They started a siege of Tenochtitlan, so that no food or supplies could get in. After 91 days, without any food, and with disease throughout the city, Cuauhtemoc finally surrendered to the Spanish on August 13, 1521. The Spanish destroyed Tenochtitlan. They started a Spanish colony that they named New Spain. The Aztec Empire had ended.
There were many different reasons why the Spanish were able to take over the Aztec Empire.
First, their weapons and armor were better than the Aztecs'. Aztec warriors had only cotton armour and shields made of wood or reeds to protect them. The Spanish had metal armor and shields.
For weapons, Aztec warriors had a few choices:
None of these weapons could compare to the conquistadors' rifles and cannons. The conquistadors also had horses and war dogs, which gave them even more of an advantage against the Aztecs.
As early as 1528, reports have said that Motecuhzoma II thought Hernán Cortés was the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl. Aztec legends said that Quetzalcoatl would return as a man, and Cortés had arrived on Quetzalcoatl's birthday. Aztec writings from the time say that when Motecuhzoma II greeted Cortés, he gave an abdication speech, giving up the Aztec throne to "Quetzalcoatl-Cortés":
As historian David Carrasco explains: Motecuhzoma II is welcoming "Quetzalcoatl-Cortes ... back to his city in order to reoccupy the throne which has been guarded by Montezuma and the other [kings] ... The ancient prophecy has been fulfilled and the returning lord is invited to occupy his throne and visit the palace. There could hardly be a clearer statement of returning the sovereignty to the original king."
Some historians say that the Spanish conquistadors were not the only reason the Aztec Empire fell apart. By 1519, the Empire had other problems that made it easier for Spain to take it over. For example:
Because of these things, many people in the Aztec Empire were unhappy. Some of them helped the Spanish conquistadors take over the Empire. Some historians, like Brian Fagan and Nadia Durrani, say that the Empire would have fallen apart even if the Spanish had never come. However, because so many people had died of smallpox, there were also not enough people left to fight against the conquistadors when they did come.
<br>
<br>
Under Spanish control, the Aztec Empire did not exist any more. The Spanish tried to change the Aztecs into Catholics and into people who acted like they came from Spain. They made it easier to change from Aztec rule to Spanish rule by letting the Aztec nobles become Spanish nobles.
The conquistadors rewarded people who had helped them take over the Empire with the Encomienda system. Under this system, Aztecs were forced to work on other people's land. This was not too different from what many serfs had done during the Aztec Empire. However, workers were badly abused, and many died. Because of this, a Spanish bishop named Bartolomé de las Casas suggested using African slaves to work in New Spain instead. Later, when he saw how much worse African slaves were treated, las Casas changed his mind about this.
By 1680, 94% of the Aztec population had died. This happened for a few reasons:
After taking over the Aztec Empire, the Spanish conquistadors moved on to take over other parts of Mesoamerica. During the same 160 years from 1520 to 1680 between 85% and 95% of Mesoamerica's native population died.

Stuxnet

Stuxnet is cyber weapon and computer worm. It was used to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program with what would seem like a long series of unfortunate accidents. It was first released in 2006. It became known only after the release of the second version. In 2010, an error in the code led the virus to spread outside the test labs and infect computers around the world.
Both the United States and Israel have been accused of developing and releasing Stuxnet. In 2012 the US confirmed that it developed Stuxnet with Israel.
Stuxnet targets PLCs. They control machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or centrifuges for separating nuclear material. Stuxnet works by targeting machines using the Microsoft Windows operating system and networks. It then looks for Siemens Step7 software. Stuxnet reportedly compromised Iranian PLCs, collecting information on industrial systems and causing the fast-spinning centrifuges to tear themselves apart. Stuxnet reportedly ruined almost one-fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.
Stuxnet is typically introduced to the target environment via an infected USB flash drive. The worm then spreads across the network, scanning for Siemens Step7 software on computers controlling a PLC. If it doesn't find a target, Stuxnet becomes dormant inside the computer.
Stuxnet is special for different reasons:
Even though it targeted PLCs only very few were infected. The software is written to infect a specific set of PLC, with well-defined modules. In the case of a personal computer, it will infect any computer running the right software.

Indian summer

Indian summer is a period of unusually warm and dry weather. It happens in autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. The United States National Weather Service describes Indian summer as weather conditions which are sunny and clear with higher than usual temperatures. That occurs between late September and the middle of November.
It is not known where the term came from. It may have come from regions inhabited by Native Americans (who used to be called Indians), or because the Native Americans first described it to Europeans. It also may have been based on the warm and hazy conditions in autumn when Native Americans hunted.

<doc id="519234" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=519234" title="White Ship">
White Ship

The White Ship () was a historic ship that sank in the English Channel. It went down near the Normandy coast off Barfleur, on 25 November 1120. Only two of those aboard survived. Those who drowned included William Adelin, the only surviving legitimate son and heir of King Henry I of England. William Adelin's death led to a succession crisis and a chain of events that changed the history of England. 
The "White Ship" was a new ship captained by Thomas FitzStephen. His father Stephen FitzAirard had been captain of the ship "Mora" for William the Conqueror when he invaded England in 1066. FitzStephen offered his ship to Henry I of England to use it to return to England from Barfleur in Normandy. Henry had already made other plans, but allowed many members of his royal court to take the "White Ship." This included his only son, William Adelin. It also included his illegitimate son Richard of Lincoln, his illegitimate daughter Matilda FitzRoy, Countess of Perche and many other nobles. According to the chronicler Orderic Vitalis, the crew asked William Adelin for wine and he supplied it to them in great abundance. By the time the ship was ready to leave there were about 300 people on board although some had left before the ship sailed due to the excessive drinking going on.
The ship's captain, Thomas FitzStephen, was ordered by the revelers to catch up to and pass the king's ship which had already sailed. The "White Ship" was fast, of the best construction and had recently been fitted with new materials. This made the captain and crew certain they could reach England first. But when the ship left in the dark, its port side struck a submerged rock called "Quillebœuf" and the ship quickly sank. William Adelin got into a small boat and could have survived but he turned back to try to save his half-sister, Matilda (Countess of Perche), when he heard her cries for help. His boat filled with water when others tried to get in to save themselves, and William drowned along with them. According to Orderic Vitalis only two survived by clinging to the rock all night. One was a butcher from Rouen, the second was Geoffrey de l'Aigle. The chronicler further claimed that when Thomas FitzStephen came to the surface after the sinking and learned that William Adelin had not survived, he let himself drown rather than face the King.
One legend says that the ship was doomed because priests were not allowed to board it in the customary manner.
A direct result of William Adelin's death was the period known as the Anarchy. The "White Ship" disaster had left Henry I with only one legitimate child, a second daughter named Matilda. Although Henry I had forced his barons to swear an oath to support Matilda as his heir on several occasions. A woman had never ruled in England in her own right. Matilda was also unpopular because she was married to Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou. He was a traditional enemy of England's Norman nobles. Upon Henry's death in 1135, the English barons were not sure they wanted Matilda as queen Regnant. 
One of Henry I's male relatives, Stephen of Blois, the king's nephew by his sister Adela, usurped Matilda as well as his older brothers William and Theobald to become king. Stephen had allegedly planned to travel on the "White Ship" but had left just before it sailed; Orderic Vitalis attributes this to a sudden bout of diarrhoea.
After Henry I's death, Matilda and her husband Geoffrey of Anjou, the founder of the Plantagenet dynasty, started a long and devastating war against Stephen and his allies for control of the English throne. The period called the Anarchy lasted from 1135 to 1153 with devastating effect, especially in southern England.

<doc id="519244" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=519244" title="Port and starboard">
Port and starboard

Port and starboard are nautical terms for left and right, respectively. Port is the left-hand side of or direction from a vessel, facing forward. Starboard is the right-hand side, facing forward. Since port and starboard never change, they are clear references that do not depend on which way the observer is facing. 
The term "starboard" comes from the Old English "steorbord", meaning the side on which the ship is steered. Before ships had rudders on their center-lines, they were steered with a steering oar at the stern of the ship. Because more people are right-handed it was placed on the right-hand side. The term is similar to the Old Norse "stýri" (rudder) and "borð" (side of a ship). Since the steering oar was on the right side of the boat, it would tie up at wharf on the other side. For this reason the left side was called "port". 
Formerly "larboard" was used instead of "port". This is from Middle English "ladebord" and the term "lade" is related to the modern "load". "Larboard" sounded very similar to "starboard" and in 1844 the Royal Navy ordered that "port" be used instead. "Larboard" continued to be used well into the 1850s by whalers. In Old English the word was "bæcbord", which is used in other European languages, for example as the German "backbord" and the French term "bâbord" (derived in turn from Middle Dutch).
At night, the port side of a boat or aircraft is indicated by a red navigation light at the bow. The opposite side of the bow has a green one to help avoid collisions. The "International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea" state that a ship on the left must give way to a ship on its right. If the courses of two boats are intersecting, the helmsman usually gives way to a red light by going around the stern of the stand-on vessel (the vessel that does not need to change course). A saying for this is:
"If to starboard red appear,<br> 
'tis your duty to keep clear...<br> 
Green to green, red to red<br> 
perfect safety, go ahead."

<doc id="519269" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=519269" title="Reasonable doubt">
Reasonable doubt

Evidence that is beyond a reasonable doubt is the standard of evidence required to validate a criminal conviction in most adversarial legal systems. Generally, the prosecutor has the burden of proof and is required to prove their case to this standard. This means that the version of events being presented by the prosecution must be proven to the extent that there could be no "reasonable doubt" in the mind of a "reasonable person" that the defendant is guilty. There can still be a doubt, but only to the extent that it would "not" affect a reasonable person's belief regarding whether or not the defendant is guilty. Beyond "the shadow of a doubt" is sometimes used interchangeably with beyond reasonable doubt. But this term extends beyond the latter, to the extent that it may be considered an impossible standard. The term "reasonable doubt" is most commonly used.
If doubt "does" affect a "reasonable person's" belief that the defendant is guilty, then the jury is not satisfied beyond "reasonable doubt". The precise meaning of words such as "reasonable" and "doubt" are usually defined within jurisprudence of the applicable country. A related idea is William Blackstone's formulation: "It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer".

Adversarial system

The adversarial system or adversary system is a legal system used in the common law countries. It is a system where two advocates represent their parties' positions before an impartial person or group of people. This is usually a jury or judge who attempt to determine the truth of the case. It is in contrast to the inquisitorial system used in some civil law systems (i.e. those deriving from Roman law or the Napoleonic code). This is where a judge or group of judges opens an official inquiry and decides the case.
The adversarial system is the two-part system under which criminal law courts operate. On one side is the prosecution who usually represents the government. The other side is the defense who represents the defendant. Each party may call witnesses and ask questions. Each party may present evidence based on legal ethics and that is approved by the court. For example, legal ethics prevent a lawyer from calling a witness they know will lie on the witness stand. Justice is served when the most effective adversary is able to convince the jury or judge that his or her case is the correct one.

<doc id="519282" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=519282" title="Statute of limitations">
Statute of limitations

Statutes of limitations are laws passed by a legislative body in common law systems to set the maximum time after an event when legal proceedings may be started. When the period of time specified in a statute of limitations passes, a legal claim can no longer be filed. The intention of these laws is to make sure legal cases are brought to trial in a reasonable length of time. In civil law (legal system) systems, similar provisions are typically part of their civil or criminal codes and known collectively as "periods of prescription". The cause of action dictates the statute of limitations, which can be reduced (or extended) to ensure a fair trial. When a statute of limitations expires (runs out) in a criminal case, the courts no longer have jurisdiction. After that time has run out a person can no longer be placed on trial for that cause. However, once filed, cases do not need to be resolved within the period specified in the statute of limitations.

<doc id="519289" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=519289" title="Cause of action">
Cause of action

Under the law, a cause of action is a set of facts sufficient to justify a right to sue to obtain money, property, or the enforcement of a right against another party. It means literally the cause or reason why a party can make a legal case under the law. The term also refers to the legal theory upon which a plaintiff brings a lawsuit (such as breach of contract, battery, or false imprisonment). The legal document which carries a claim is often called a Statement of Claim in English law, or a Complaint in U.S. federal practice and in many U.S. states. A complaint identifies the court's jurisdiction, the alleged facts and the relief the plaintiff wants. It can be any communication notifying the party to whom it is addressed of an alleged fault which resulted in damages. This is often expressed in amount of money the receiving party should pay or reimburse.
To pursue a cause of action, a plaintiff pleads or alleges facts in a complaint, the pleading that starts a lawsuit. A cause of action generally includes both the legal theory (the legal wrong the plaintiff claims to have suffered) and the remedy (the relief a court is asked to grant). Often the facts or circumstances that allow a person to seek judicial relief may create multiple causes of action. Although it is fairly easy to file a Statement of Claim in most jurisdictions. If it is not done properly, then the filing party may lose his case due to simple technicalities.
There are a number of specific causes of action, including: contract-based actions, statutory causes of action, torts such as assault, battery, invasion of privacy and fraud. The points a plaintiff must prove to win a given type of case are called the "elements" of that cause of action. For example, for a claim of negligence, the elements are: the (existence of a) duty, breach (of that duty), proximate cause (legal cause), and damages. If a complaint does not allege facts sufficient to support every element of a claim, the court, upon motion by the opposing party, may dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted.
The defendant to a cause of action must file an "Answer" to the complaint in which the "claims" can be admitted or denied. The answer may also contain counterclaims in which the "Counterclaim Plaintiff" states its own causes of action. Finally, the answer may contain affirmative defenses. Most defenses must be raised at the first possible opportunity. Either in the answer or by motion or are considered to be waived.

French American

French Americans (French: "Américain français"), also called Franco-Americans (French: "Franco-Américain") are Americans who identify themselves to be of French or French Canadian descent. About 11.8 million U.S. residents are of French or French Canadian descent. About 2 million speak French at home. An additional 750,000 U.S. residents speak a French-based creole language, according to the 2011 census.
Americans of French descent make up a substantial percentage of the American population. However French Americans are less visible than other similarly sized ethnic groups. This is due in part to the high degree of assimilation among Huguenot (French Protestant) settlers. Also, there is a tendency of French American groups to identify more strongly with "New World" regional identities. These include Québécois, French Canadian, Acadian, Cajun, or Louisiana Creole. This has prevented the development of a wider French American identity.

Criminal procedure

Criminal procedure refers to the rules that determine how the courts will process a criminal trial. While criminal procedure differs by jurisdiction, the process generally begins with a formal criminal charge and results in the or acquittal of the defendant.
Many countries have a democratic system and use the rule of law. There are a number of common principals. In a criminal case the burden of proof is on the prosecution. That means it is up to the prosecution to prove that the defendant is guilty beyond any reasonable doubt. This is opposed to having the defendant prove he or she is innocent. It also means any doubt is resolved in favor of the defendant. This provision is known as the presumption of innocence. If charged with a felony, defendants have the following basic rights:

Insanity defense

In criminal trials, the insanity defense is the claim that the defendant is not responsible for his or her actions due to a mental illness. People who have been determined to be insane have been exempt from full criminal punishment since the Code of Hammurabi. There are different definitions of legal insanity in different jurisdictions. A finding of insanity usually results in the defendant being confined in a mental health facility instead of a prison. The first to use this defense was Daniel Sickles when he killed his wife's lover Francis Barton Key (son of Francis Scott Key) in 1859.
In the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States, use of the insanity defense is rare. However, insanity pleas have steadily increased in the UK. Mitigating factors, including things not eligible for the insanity defense like intoxication (or, more frequently, diminished capacity), may lead to reduced charges or reduced sentences. 
The question of who bears the burden of proof is an issue in the United States. Before the John Hinckley, Jr. trial the burden of proof rested with the government in most states. Afterwards many of these states required the defense to prove the defendant was legally insane. Where the state still bears the burden of proof, the standard for the prosecution is beyond a reasonable doubt. Where the defense bears the burden, the standard is preponderance of the evidence (a lower standard).
The insanity defense is based on evaluations by forensic mental health professionals with the appropriate test according to the jurisdiction. Their testimony guides the jury (or judge in a bench trial). But they may not testify to the defendant's criminal responsibility. This is for the jury or judge to decide. Mental health experts may testify as to whether at the time of the crime the defendant understood what he did was wrong. If the defendant were acting under a delusion at the time and could still determine right from wrong, he is not insane and may be punished.

Arbitration

Arbitration, a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR), is a way of resolving disputes outside the courts. Litigation can be expensive, time-consuming and unpredictable. With arbitration the parties to a dispute agree to have the disagreement decided by a neutral third party. More often this is a panel of three arbitrators. Each party suggests one, then both arbitrators agree on a third arbitrator. The decision is the result of a majority vote.
Arbitration includes an agreement in advance by both parties to comply with the decision of the arbitrator(s). The process includes a hearing in which both parties may be heard. The arbitrator(s) reviews the evidence in the case and makes a decision. One that is legally binding on both sides and enforceable in the courts.
Another form of alternative dispute resolution is mediation. Mediation and arbitration both use neutral third parties. For that reason they are sometimes confused. One difference is that a mediator does not make any decisions. Instead the mediator works towards getting both parties to agree. Unlike Arbitration, there is usually only one mediator. Another difference is that mediation is usually non-binding. Mediation is used more often in smaller disputes or when the matter is kept confidential. In some jurisdictions, mediation is required before a case can come to court.

Algebraic topology is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces. Algebraic topology can be used in a number of other fields such as physics, branches of geometry and number theory.
Algebraic topology can be used to count "holes" in a shape: for example, a wedding ring and a hollow pipe both have one hole, but a figure-8 has two. This can also be done in different dimensions; the sphere has a kind of "2-dimensional" hole.

Damages

In law, damages are an award, usually of money. It is to be paid to a person as compensation for loss or injury. The rules for damages can and frequently do vary based on the type of claim which is presented (e.g., breach of contract versus a tort claim) and the jurisdiction. Damages are not the same as court costs which includes the costs to bring a legal case to court. The losing party may also have to pay court costs.
In common law countries, damages are usually categorized into compensatory (or actual) damages, and punitive damages. Compensatory damages are further categorized into special damages and general damages. Special damages include economic losses such as loss of earnings, property damage and medical expenses. General damages are noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering and emotional distress. Statutory damages are those required by statute.
Compensatory damages are paid to compensate the claimant for loss, injury, or harm suffered as a result of another's negligence (tort law). Expectation damages are used in contract law. In civil law countries, these are called "ordinary damages" and may be limited to actual loss.
Generally, punitive damages, which are also termed "exemplary damages" in the United Kingdom, are not awarded in order to compensate the plaintiff, but in order to reform or deter the defendant. They are also to intended to be an example to others not to do the same thing. Punitive damages are awarded when it is determined that compensatory damages are not enough. Punitive damages are awarded over and above the amount of compensatory damages, such as in the event of malice or intent. Great judicial restraint is expected to be exercised in their use. In the United States punitive damages awards are subject to the limitations imposed by the due process of law clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.
Punitive damages in most civil law countries are not awarded. 
Statutory damages are an amount stated within the statute rather than calculated based on the degree of harm to the plaintiff. Lawmakers will provide for statutory damages for acts in which it is difficult to determine the value of the harm to the victim. Someone breaking the law can entitle the victim to a statutory award. This is even if no actual injury happened. 
For example, United States Civil Code 18 USC §§2520 provides for statutory damages to victims of various wiretapping offenses.

<doc id="519533" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=519533" title="Equity (law)">
Equity (law)

In common law countries equity is based on a judiciary assessment of fairness. It is what is often what is considered fair and right under natural law. It is used when the laws themselves do not address an issue or are inadequate in some way. Examples of equity decisions include imposing a lien, correcting a property line or ordering someone to do something to prevent damage.
Common law in England can be traced back to the Norman conquest. The laws, such as they were then, did not address every concern. At first, a subject (of the king) had to petition the king to ask to be heard in his court. One of the first instances of this was in 1070 when Lanfranc, the Archbishop of Canterbury had a case against Odo, Earl of Kent, the king's brother. The archbishop petitioned that lands taken by Odo be restored. Rules of equity began when it became apparent that the common law courts could not solve all legal problems. The king set up courts of chancery (equity). By the 1800s the equity courts were becoming obsolete. In 1875 Parliament did away with the chancery courts altogether.
States in New England followed the English tradition of maintaining separate courts for law and equity. Others, however, combined their courts with both types of jurisdiction. This is what Congress did with respect to the US federal courts. United States bankruptcy courts are the one example of US federal courts which operate as courts of equity.

Commoners

The terms commoners, common people or the masses refers to ordinary people who are members of neither the nobility nor the priesthood. In a system of social classes they are those without title or rank. Since the 20th century, the term "common people" has been used in its place. It refers to typical members of society in contrast to highly privileged (in either wealth or influence).
In Europe, a concept of common people started in the classical antiquity of ancient Rome around the 6th century BC. The Roman social division was into patricians (nobles) and plebeians (commoners). The division may have been instituted by Servius Tullius, as an alternative to the previous clan based divisions that had been responsible for internecine conflict. The ancient Greeks generally had no concept of class and their leading social divisions were simply non-Greeks, free-Greeks and slaves. With the growth of Christianity in the 4th century AD, a new world view arose in European thinking about social division. This continued until at least early modern times. Saint Augustine stated that social division was a result of the Fall of Man. The three leading divisions were considered to be the priesthood (clergy), the nobility, and the common people. Sometimes this would be expressed as "those who prayed", "those who fought" and "those who worked". The Latin terms for the three classes – "oratores", "bellatores" and "laboratores" – are often found even in modern textbooks, and have been used in sources since the 9th century.

Pseudogene

Pseudogenes are genes that have lost their function. They have lost their gene expression in the cell or their ability to code protein. The term was coined in 1977.
Pseudogenes can result from mutations in a gene whose product is not needed for the survival of the organism. Although not protein-coding, the DNA of pseudogenes may be functional. It may be similar to other kinds of non-coding DNA which have a regulatory role.
Most have some gene-like features. They lack protein-coding ability resulting from a variety of disabling mutations, or their inability to encode RNA (such as with rRNA pseudogenes). 
Pseudogenes are generally thought of as the last stop for genomic material that is to be removed from the genome, so they are often labeled as junk DNA. Pseudogenes contain fascinating biological and evolutionary histories in their sequences. This is due to a pseudogene's shared ancestry with a functional gene. In the same way that Darwin thought of two species as having a shared common ancestry followed by millions of years of evolutionary divergence (see speciation), a pseudogene and its associated functional gene also share a common ancestor and have diverged as separate genetic entities over millions of years.

In civil proceedings and criminal prosecutions under the common law, a defendant may raise a defense (or defence) in an attempt to avoid criminal or civil liability. It is an answer, made by a defendant to a plaintiff's action or a denial of a prosecutor's charges. It is also an answer in equity.
Under common law, a defendant may raise any of the numerous defenses to limit or avoid liability. These include:
In a criminal trial, there are a wide variety of defenses offered. Some of these include:
Many of the above are considered an affirmative defense in which case the burden of proof may be on the defendant to prove their innocence. Otherwise in a criminal trial the burden of proof usually rests with the prosecution. They must prove the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

Defence in depth

Defense in depth (also known as deep or elastic defense) is a military strategy. It is a delaying tactic intended to slow down the advance of an enemy instead of stopping them. The tactic buys time by yielding to the enemy slowly. It usually causes additional casualties. A defense in depth can slow down an advancing army causing them to lose momentum.
Hannibal used this tactic at the Battle of Cannae in 216 BC. Facing a much larger Roman army, he placed his less experienced soldiers in the center. On either side were his most experienced fighters. When the Romans advanced, his center gradually moved back while the troops on the wings began to surround the Romans. It was the largest slaughter of Roman soldiers in the history of the republic.
The classic example is Medieval hill forts and castles with rings of defenses (usually walls). The inner circles of defenders support the outer circles with missiles fire. The attacker has to breach each line of defense exhausting himself in the process.
The German army used the tactic in 1917 during World War I. The Germans used it to great effect on both the French and British armies until July 1918. The arrival of the American forces joining the French and British ended the German tactic.
A properly planned defense in depth can be used to reduce or eliminate any advantage an attacking force might have. This includes superior numbers. The defender places the object of the attack behind several layers of defense. The defenders then let the attacker wear down his forces while they slowly give ground and move back to the next layer of defense.
Carl von Clausewitz, Sun Tzu and the martial art of Budō all agreed that the preferred form of war was defense. Clausewitz stated that defense provided the defenders with additional . A defense in depth can prevent an enemy from surrounding your position. It also provides an excellent opportunity to Counterattack. A defense in space is not being there when an enemy attacks. A defense in time means slowing down or blocking an enemy when they do attack.
A similar tactic is called a "delaying action". The object is for a smaller force to harass a larger force and delay their advance. This while inflicting as much damage as they can to the larger force without directly engaging them. The purpose of a delaying action is to allow an army's main force to disengage an enemy while maintaining good order. The main force is given the time necessary to set up a new defensive position. The small force protecting the larger force is called a rearguard. A famous rearguard example was given in the "Song of Roland". Roland, nephew of Charlemagne commanded the rearguard at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. He and his men protected the rear of the Frankish army while they retreated back to France. In this delaying action, Roland and his men were all killed in an ambush.

A gene family is a set of several similar genes. They occur by the duplication of a single original gene. Usually they have similar biochemical functions. The idea that genes get duplicated is almost as old as the science of genetics. 
One such family are the genes for human haemoglobin subunits. The ten genes are in two clusters on different chromosomes, called the α-globin and β-globin loci. These two gene clusters are thought to have arisen from a precursor gene being duplicated, about 500 million years ago. 
The biggest gene family is said to be the olfaction genes. The homeobox genes are another important group. 
Genes for the immune system include several gene families. They code for the major histocompatibility complex, and the immunoglobulins. The toll-like receptors are the main sensors of infection in mammals.

Evidence (law)

In law, evidence is an object of some kind, a document of some kind, or the testimony of a person in a court of law. Evidence is used to show something is either true or false. Evidence has to follow rules in most jurisdictions. In the United States, for example, evidence was based on legal precedent until 1975. In that year Congress created the Federal Rules of Evidence. They became the official rules that all forms of evidence must follow in federal courts. Most states in the US use rules based on the federal rules. China, while a civil law country, has followed much of the US Federal Rules of Evidence in their " Uniform Provisions of Evidence".
In most jurisdictions there are exclusionary rules that automatically suppress certain kinds of evidence. For example, in the US, this may be evidence that violates the constitutional rights of a defendant. To be admissible in most jurisdictions, evidence must be relevant and it must be reliable. In most cases evidence that may prejudice a jury or judge against a defendant is inadmissible.

Impartiality

An part of any of the world's legal systems is impartiality. It is important for tribunals, judges, jurys and Arbitrators to be impartial. It is equally important for the legal systems themselves to be impartial.
Judges cannot favor one party over another or give more weight to one side's claims than the other. Judges learn about the law from outside the courtroom and before a trial begins. Because of this a judge may have an opinion regarding the law. When a judge expresses these views he or she is not being impartial.
In the US legal system, juries are screened and individuals selected by a process called "voir dire". Both the prosecution and the defense question jury candidates before a judge. This is to see if they can remain impartial. Any person having a personal interest in the outcome of the trial or who is obviously biased may be removed. This is called "striking" a juror. It is rare to have more than 10% of potential jurors struck from a trial. Trial by jury began in the United Kingdom. Except for cases where there is a provision by the law, it is the right of every person accused of a crime to have an impartial jury trial. More and more criminal trials are held without a jury. The less severe crimes are tried by Magistrates. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the right to a fair trial. In Canada juries are made up of 12 ordinary persons, male or female, who are expected to be impartial triers of fact. They decide whether the Crown (the prosecution) has made its case. Judges have the option of increasing the jury to 13 or 14 jurors, but only 12 may vote on the guilt or innocence of the accused. 
Juries in Scotland have 15 jurors. In many European civil law countries and Japan, juries can be made up of laypersons and judges. Also the opposing council may not be able to strike jurors as in the United States. 
Many believe the Magna Carta first guaranteed a right to trial by one's peers. The Latin "judicium parium" does not mean a trial by jury. The word "judicium" in the language of the day meant a judge. The term "liber homo", usually translated as "freeman", at that time were a limited class in England. So it did not mean every person.

Charles Russell

Charles Russell (1817-1892), known as "Black Douglas", was an Australian bushranger, who became famous for robbing miners on the road between Bendigo and Melbourne.
Russell was born in Bristol, England in 1817. After coming to Australia, he was well known as a prize fighter, boxing for money. He began robbing people on their way to and from the goldfields at Bendigo. One report claimed he robbed 16 people and chained them to a log. Because of the danger of bushrangers like Black Douglas on the roads, the government set up a gold escort, a coach protected by police troopers to carry gold to Melbourne. One of Black Douglas's tricks was to rob the tents of miners during the day while they were busy digging for gold. He and his gang were captured by an angry mob of gold miners near Maryborough in May 1855. They were going to punish the bushrangers, but the police arrived and saved them. They were charged with various crimes and put in prison. He served several prison terms, and was in prison at Rochester when he died in 1892.
In 1860, Wilhelmine Guischard wrote a book called "Black Douglas: An Australian Romance".
In 1926, his pistol was given to the police. Russell has forgotten it during a robbery in 1857. It was planned to present it to the Castlemaine Art Gallery.

All he felt he could do was retire. He was later imprisoned for these same views. When General Douglas MacArthur became the military governor of Japan, Yoshida was called to Tokyo to become the new foreign minister.

Andy Dalton

Andrew Gregory Dalton (born October 29, 1987) is an American football quarterback for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Texas Christian University (TCU). In his final college game, the 2011 Rose Bowl against the Wisconsin Badgers, Dalton led the Horned Frogs to a 21–19 victory. He left the TCU program as its all-time leader in wins. He also holds several statistical passing records.
Dalton was selected by the Bengals in the second round (35th overall) of the 2011 NFL Draft. He signed a four-year, $5.2 million contract. Under a West Coast-style offensive scheme, Dalton and receiver A.J. Green, the Bengals' 2011 first-round selection from the University of Georgia, have become a great quarterback/receiver combination. Dalton and Green broke NFL records for completions (completed passes) and yards for a rookie quarterback/receiver combination.
Dalton is one of five quarterbacks in NFL history to have thrown for over 3,000 yards in each of his first three seasons. The others are Cam Newton, Peyton Manning, Andrew Luck, and Russell Wilson. Dalton is also one of five to have passed for at least 20 touchdowns in each of his first three seasons. He joins Manning, Luck, Wilson, and Dan Marino. Dalton is the only quarterback to lead the Cincinnati Bengals to four consecutive Playoffs. He is just one of five quarterbacks to lead his team to the playoffs in each of his first four seasons. He is also the Bengals franchise record holder for passing yards and touchdowns in a season. 
Due to his red hair, Dalton has been nicknamed "The Red Rifle" by Bengals fans.

Injunction

An injunction is a court order that either commands or prevents a party from doing a specific act. 
Injunctions can be temporary or permanent. A restraining order and a preliminary injunction are examples of temporary injunctions. Either may be issued early in a lawsuit to prevent either party from doing anything that might unfairly influence the outcome of the litigation. A permanent injunction is usually issued after a case is settled. It enforces the final decision of the court.
In the state of New South Wales, an apprehended violence order (AVO) may be issued against a person from whom another person fears violence. They can be issued to prevent physical abuse, harassment or stalking. Any person who violates an AVO may be charged with a criminal offence.
While the United Kingdom has injunctions much the same as other countries they also have super-injunctions. This is an injunction (sometimes called a gag-order) that prevents journalists from writing anything about a court case. It also prevents them from reporting that the injunction itself has been issued. If any injunction in the UK prevents details of the order from being known it is also called a super-injunction.
In common law countries anti-suit injunctions are court orders used to prevent a court or tribunal from assuming jurisdiction or taking over an ongoing lawsuit. An anti-suit injunction may also be used to prevent a party from filing a second lawsuit in another jurisdiction at the same time as the first case.

Judgment (law)

In law, a judgment is a decision of a court regarding the rights and liabilities of parties in a legal action or proceeding. Judgments also generally provide the court's explanation of why it has chosen to make a particular decision.
The phrase "reasons for judgment" is often used interchangeably with "judgment." The former refers to the court's reasons for arriving at the judgment it did. The latter refers to the final court order. a judgement, whether by a court or a tribunal, is the final part of a court case. The judgement is also called a legal decision.

<doc id="519910" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=519910" title="Case law">
Case law

Case law in a legal system are those laws based on previous judicial decisions. This is opposed to decisions based on existing statutes or regulations. In countries using common law, it is generally uncodified meaning there are no collections of legal rules and laws to rely on. Instead they rely on legal precedent. Precedents are previous legal cases that are used as examples for deciding the present case. They are also binding on lower courts where the facts and issues are similar. In countries that use civil law, their laws are codified and there is much less reliance on case law. 
Judges make judicial decisions based on precedent and their own understanding when there are few or no precedents. This is "judge-made law" as compared to statuary law, which is made by ledislatures and governments. In the United States the courts can rule statutes and regulations unconstitutional if they go beyond the authority given by the constitution. In the United Kingdom judge-made law or common law cannot rule against statutes made by an act of Parliament. The judiciary and legislative branches are not coequal. Judges, however, have traditionally used one of three ways of interpreting statutes: 
Judges make decisions by decisions based on the appropriate laws. The judge first brings the formal charges against the accused. They then investigate to learn all the facts. Finally they make a decision. Under civil law, judiciary decisions are not a critical part of forming civil laws. Under Dutch civil law for example, there are so many civil laws that it becomes difficult for lawyers and judges to know if they have found all the laws that apply to a case. Even with all the laws, not every situation is covered. The civil court will research everything it can on the subject, then make a decision. For this reason those who start a legal case never know for certain what the decision will be.

Lien

A lien ( or ) is a form of security interest attached to property to secure the payment of a debt to a creditor. A lien is usually a public record. The owner of the property is called the "lienee". The creditor or person holding the lien is called the "lienor" or "lien holder".
In the United States, the term lien generally refers to a wide range of legal interests. It includes other forms of mortgage or charge. In the USA, a lien is a "non-possessory" security interests meaning the lien holder does not usually possess the property.
In other common law countries, the term lien refers to a very specific type of security interest. The holder of a lien right to retain (but not sell) property until the debt or other obligation is discharged. In contrast to the usage of the term in the USA, in other countries it refers to a purely "possessory" form of security interest. When possession of the property is lost, the lien is released.

Lanfranc

Lanfranc (1005  1010 at Pavia — 24 May 1089 at Canterbury) was a cleric, teacher and jurist who became Archbishop of Canterbury under William the Conqueror.
This celebrated Italian jurist gave up his career to become a monk at Bec in Normandy. In 1070 he became the Archbishop of Canterbury in England. This was the peak of an extraordinary life.
Lanfranc was born in the early years of the 11th century at Pavia in Italy. His father, Hanbald, held a rank equivalent to a magistrate. He was orphaned at an early age. Lanfranc was trained in the liberal arts. He crossed the Alps, and took up the role of teacher in France and eventually in Normandy. About 1039 he became the master of the cathedral school at Avranches. He taught for three years with much success. 
In 1042 he gave this up to become a monk in the newly founded Bec Abbey. He became the first prior of Bec Abbey in 1045. He became a friend of William, Duke of Normandy and by 1050 his counselor. Lanfranc then became the abbot of St Stephen in Normandy. 
In 1067, when Maurilius, Archbishop of Rouen, died, Lanfrac declined the position. He would not have been able to do so without the consent of William I. It is likely William had something bigger in mind for Lanfranc. In 1070 Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury was deposed by papal legates. William brought Lanfranc from Normandy to England to become the Archbishop of Canterbury.

Five Nights at Freddy's (series)

"Five Nights at Freddy's" is a physiological horror series that that began with a game where you see through the eyes of a security guard who works the night shift at "Freddy Fazbear's Pizza". But this is no normal pizzeria because you have to watch the restaurant's four robots over security camerask. The characters are named Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken and Foxy the Pirate Fox. A fifth secret animatronic named Golden Freddy can also appear in the game. One of the posters in the cameras shows Freddy's face, but it can change to Golden Freddy's face and he will then appear in your office and crash your game. Throughout the nights, a man gives you instructions over the phone and has been named Phone Guy. According to him all of these robots try to stuff you into a Freddy costume killing you in the process. He says this is because they think you are a robot skeleton. To protect yourself, you have the camera which will keep Foxy from moving and Freddy from moving if the camera's on him. If you see them in the doorways on either side of your office, you have to close them but this takes up the building's power which is limited. If your power shuts off Freddy makes his way to the left door and tries to kill you before your shift ends at 6 AM. The goal of each night is to survive until 6 AM. After the fifth night, you unlock a bonus sixth night and after that night, you unlock a custom night where you choose each robot's difficulty.
In "Five Nights at Freddys 2" at a "Freddy Fazbear's Pizza" that predates the one in the original. The restaurant consists of 11 robot characters that are the five original animatronics, Toy Freddy, Toy Bonnie Toy Chica, the Mangle/ Toy Foxy, the puppet and Balloon Boy. Since the animatronics think you're a robot skeleton, you use a Freddy mask to protect yourself, but this time there are no doors. Also, the building's power is unlimited but a flashlight is introduced in this game which does not and the flashlight can be used to keep the animatronics in place. Your flashlight, as well as the vent lights on either side of the office, will also be disabled if Balloon Boy comes into your office. Additionally, you keep the puppet out of your office by remotely winding up a music box through one of the cameras.
In "Five Nights at Freddy's 3" you see through the eyes of a security guard at "Fazbear's Fright: the Horror Attraction". In this location only a new character named Springtrap, a yellow version of Bonnie is able to kill you. There are two new ways you can prevent that: closing ventilation systems and playing audio. In this game, Phone Guy is replaced by Phone Dude, but on the second night, Phone Dude begins playing audio tapes he discovered of Phone Guy. These tapes reveal that Springtrap is attracted to audio explaining the new way you can keep Springtrap away. But both of those systems, as well as your camera system, sometimes malfunction and you have to reboot them whenever necessary. If the ventilation malfunctions you may see "phantom" versions of Freddy, Chica, Foxy, Mangle, the puppet and Balloon Boy, but their jumpscares are the first ones in the series that don't kill you. The sixth night is also called "Nightmare" and there is know custom night. 
In "Five Nights at Freddy's 4" you are a young child who is having nightmares about the animatronics. In the first four nights, you have to defend yourself against "nightmare" versions of the four original animatronics by keeping the door's on either side of your room shut. This is where Bonnie and Chica come in. When Foxy gets into your room, he runs into your closet which you also have to check to see how close he is to coming out and killing you. Nightmare plush toys of Freddy will also appear on the bed behind you and if you ignore them for too long, Freddy attacks you. On the fifth night, a nightmare version of Golden Freddy named Nightmare Fredbear replaces all four animatronics. In the sixth and seventh nights (neither of which are custom nights), a black version of Nightmare Fredbear only named "Nightmare" appears. In between nights, you play a minigame that features Plushtrap, a plush toy version of Springtrap. If you beat the minigame, you get to start at 2 A.M. on the next night. In the Halloween edition of the game, three new characters are introduced; Nightmare Balloon Boy (who replaces Plushtrap), Nightmare Mangle (who replaces Nightmare Foxy) and a nightmare version of the puppet named Nightmarionne (who replaces Nightmare). In this game, your flashlight power is unlimited. 
In "Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location", you are a technician who works at "Circus Baby's Rentals and Entertainment". The animatronics in this game are "funtime" versions of Freddy and Foxy as well as three new animatronics: Circus Baby, Ballora and Ennard. Instead of trying to survive by keeping these five animatronics out of your office, you move around the location completing tasks given to you by an AI named HandUnit and nights end once these tasks are completed. Three of the animatronics have what might be called minions. Funtime Freddy has Bon-Bon, a hand puppet version of Bonnie, Circus Baby has Bidybabs, and Ballora has Minireenas. There are no bonus nights.

Security interest

A security interest is a legal claim on collateral. The collateral can be real estate, personal property or any asset. Collateral is usually used to secure a loan. 
The borrower is the party who borrows the funds. The lender is the one who lends the money in return for a security interest. The lender can repossess the asset if the borrower fails to repay the loan. The lender can then sell the asset to repay the loan. A loan secured by collateral is called a "secured loan" (also called a lien). A loan with no collateral (such as a credit card) is an unsecured loan. There is nothing for the lender to repossess.
There are different types of security interest or liens:

William Benjamin Carpenter

William Benjamin Carpenter MD MRCS CB FRS (29 October 1813 – 19 November 1885) was an English physician, invertebrate zoologist and physiologist. He was instrumental in the early stages of the unified University of London.
Carpenter was born on 29 Oct 1813 in Exeter, the eldest son of Dr Lant Carpenter, an important Unitarian preacher who influenced a "rising generation of Unitarian intellectuals". From his father, Carpenter inherited a belief in the essential lawfulness of the creation: this meant that natural causes were the explanation of the world as we find it. William embraced this "naturalistic cosmogeny" as his starting point.
Although qualified medically, he was best known for his work on marine zoology, notably the lower organisms such as Foraminifera and crinoids. These researches gave an impetus to deep-sea exploration, such as the 1868 oceanographic survey with "HMS Lightning" and later the more famous Challenger Expedition.
In the long term, however, he has become known as a founder of idea of the adaptive unconscious. He observed that the human perceptual system almost completely operates outside of conscious awareness. These same observations were also made by Hermann Helmholtz. Perhaps because these views were in conflict with the theories of Descartes, they were neglected for a hundred years. Carpenter noticed that the more he studied the mechanism of thought, the more clear it became that it operates largely outside awareness. He noticed that the unconscious prejudices can be stronger than conscious thought and that they are more dangerous since they happen outside of conscious.
He also noticed that emotional reactions can occur outside of conscious until attention is drawn to them:
He also asserted both the freedom of the will and the existence of the ego.
In the popular mind, he was perhaps better nown for his work against alcoholism, for which he won a prize of 100 guineas. It was one of the first temperance books.
In 1856 Carpenter became Registrar of the University of London, and held the office for twenty-three years. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath.

Particle detector

A particle detector, also known as a radiation detector, is a device used to , , and/or high-energy particles. These particles can be made by nuclear decay, cosmic radiation, or reactions in a particle accelerator. Particle detectors are used in particle physics, nuclear physics, and nuclear engineering. Modern detectors are also used as calorimeters to measure the energy of radiation. They can measure other things, such as the momentum, spin, or charge of the particles.
Detectors designed for modern accelerators are very big. They are also very expensive. They are called "counters" when they simply count particles, but do not measure anything else. Usually, particle detectors can also track ionizing radiation (high energy photons or even visible light).
Many of the detectors invented so far are ionization detectors (such as gaseous ionization detectors and semiconductor detectors) and scintillation detectors. Other principles, such as Čerenkov light and transition radiation, have also been applied to detect particles.

Pleading

Pleading is usually the first step in a lawsuit. This is when parties formally submit their claims and defenses. A "complaint" is the first pleading filed by a plaintiff which starts the lawsuit. A complaint lists the relevant allegations of fact which leads to one or more legal causes of action. It also has a prayer for relief and sometimes a statement of damages claimed. This is called an "ad quod damnum" clause. In some situations, a complaint is called a "petition". In this case the party filing a complaint is called the petitioner and the other party is the respondent. In equity, sometimes called chancery, the initial pleading may be called either a "petition" or a "bill of complaint in chancery".

Complaint

In legal terminology, a complaint is any formal legal document that establishes the facts and legal reasons for a lawsuit. A complaint must list the reasons for the plaintiff's case, and it must ask for a specific legal remedy. Once a complaint is filed with the court a summons (an order from the court) is notifies the defendant a lawsuit has been filed against them. Once a defendant receives notice of a complaint, they must reply within a specified period of time with an answer. Complaints are pleadings that must be written carefully to properly state the facts and legal basis for the claim. Usually this requires the help of an attorney.
In some jurisdictions, specific types of criminal cases may also be started by the filing of a complaint. This is also called a criminal complaint or felony complaint. All criminal cases are prosecuted in the name of the governmental authority. This is the same authority whose criminal laws were broken and who enforces criminal statutes. The government is sometimes called "the state", "the People" or "the Crown" (in Commonwealth realms). In the United States, the complaint is often associated with misdemeanor charges presented by the prosecutor without the grand jury process. In most US jurisdictions, the document presented to and authorized by a grand jury is called an indictment.

Vitamin B12

Vitamin B (or vitamin B-12) is also called cobalamin. It has a key role in the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system, and for the formation of blood. It is one of the eight B vitamins. 
B is normally involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body, especially DNA synthesis and regulation, but also fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. Fungi, plants and animals (including humans) cannot produce vitamin B. Only bacteria and archaea have enzymes for its synthesis, although animals can convert it to the version they need. 
Many foods are a natural source of B because of bacterial symbiosis. It is produced by some of the gut flora of herbivores. Carnivores, of course, eat herbivores. Also algae and plants get it from symbiosis. So, by one route or another, animals must get vitamin B from bacteria (and archaea).
The vitamin is the largest and most structurally complicated vitamin. It can be produced industrially only by bacterial fermentation-synthesis.
Vitamin B is a group of chemically related compounds, all of which have vitamin activity. It contains the biochemically rare element cobalt sitting in the center of a ring called a corrin ring. In the human body it is converted to the human physiological forms.
Vitamin B was discovered by its relationship to pernicious anemia, which is an autoimmune disease. Because an "intrinsic factor" is needed for B to be absorbed, its lack causes a vitamin B deficiency. Many other kinds of vitamin B deficiency have since been found.

Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz (May 28, 1807 – December 14, 1873) was a Swiss-born and European-trained biologist and geologist. His work on natural history in Europe and the Americas was important. 
His reputation now is less good, because he fought against the theory of evolution, and held wrong ideas about human races. He thought the different human races were of different origins. This idea is called "polygenism". Darwin's comment at the end is interesting:
After visiting Harvard University in mid-career, he emigrated to the U.S. in 1847 and became a professor of zoology and geology at Harvard. He founded its Museum of Comparative Zoology. 
Agassiz made extensive contributions to ichthyology (including extinct species). He founded glaciology, the study of ice fields and ice ages.

It is capable of providing a black start capability to the National Grid.
Construction began in 1959 at the same time as the Hunterston A nuclear power station in Ayrshire. It was completed in 1965. Cruachan uses cheap off-peak electricity generated at night to pump water to the higher reservoir. It can then be released during the day to provide power as necessary. The power station is open to visitors. Around 50,000 tourists visit it each year.

Steppe Geoglyphs

The Steppe Geoglyphs are a number of Neolithic earth constructions in the Turgay Trough area of Turgai in northern Kazakhstan. There are at least 260 of these earthworks.
Many or all of them are smaller earthworks (mounds, trenches and ramparts) arranged with each other to make geometric and other shapes (composite figures). These shapes are squares, rings and three others. The composite figures range from slightly under 90 m in length to over 400 m in diameter.
Besides being made of earth dug out and piled up, some of the geoglyphs are made by placing stones next to each other. 
Some of the large shapes have been given names, including Bestamskoe Ring, Ushtogaysky ("or" Ushtogay) Square, Turgay triradial swastika, Large cross Ashtasti, Ekedyn cross, Ashutasti ring, Kyzyloba line, Koga cross, and Shili square. 
Optical dating (optically stimulated luminescence) was used to get a date for these structures. The results indicate that they date between eight and one thousand years ago. 
The earthworks were discovered in 2007 by Dimitriy Dey. He found them when he was looking at Google Earth. He had been looking for pyramids or similar structures in Kazakhstan. The geoglyphs were first reported to the scientific community in 2014.

Right to a fair trial

The right to fair trial is an essential right in all countries respecting the rule of law. A trial in these countries that is considered unfair will typically be restarted, or its verdict voided. Various rights associated with a fair trial are explicitly proclaimed in Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They are clearly stated in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. They are also stated in Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights, and in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as numerous other constitutions and declarations throughout the world. There is no binding international law that defines what is or is not a fair trial. For example, the right to a jury trial and other important procedures vary from nation to nation.

<doc id="520316" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=520316" title="Due process">
Due process

Due process is the legal requirement that the government must respect all legal rights that are owed to a person. Due process balances the power of law of the land and protects the individual person from it. When a government harms a person without following the exact course of the law, this is a due process violation, which offends the rule of law.
Due process has also been frequently interpreted as limiting laws and legal proceedings. This means that judges—instead of legislators—may define and guarantee basic fairness, justice, and liberty. This interpretation has proven controversial, and is seen as being closer to the concepts of natural justice, and procedural justice used in various other jurisdictions. This interpretation of due process is sometimes expressed as a command that the government must not be unfair to the people or abuse them physically.
Due process developed from clause 39 of the Magna Carta in England. The Magna Carta called it "the law of the land" which became the more modern term due process. When English and American law gradually went in different directions, due process was not upheld in England, but did become part of the Constitution of the United States. It is found in the Fifth Amendment which says "No person shall…be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,". It is applied to all states by the Fourteenth Amendment.
Due process is not used in contemporary English law. But it recognizes two similar concepts are natural justice and the British constitutional concept of the rule of law. However, neither concept lines up perfectly with the American theory of due process. It contains many implied rights not found in the ancient or modern concepts of due process in England. 
Islamic law provides for due process. It includes the presumption of innocence, the right to remain silent and a fair and public trial before a judge. There is no jury and both parties, the injured party and the accused, usually present their own cases.
Scandinavia gets high ratings by the World Justice Project. They were noted for their criminal justice system including their observance of due process. As of the 2013 "Rule of Law Index", the Scandinavian countries were rated higher than the US for due process. The three lowest rated countries in the index were Afghanistan, Zimbabwe and Venezuela.

Roosevelt Island Bridge

The Roosevelt Island Bridge is a bridge in New York. It is a lift bridge. It connects Roosevelt Island in Manhattan to Astoria in Queens. It crosses the East Channel of the East River. The bridge is the only route to the island for vehicles and foot traffic, except for public transportation.
Construction of the bridge began on March 17, 1952. The cost was $6.5 million. It opened on May 18, 1955, as the Welfare Island Bridge. The name was changed to the "Roosevelt Island Bridge" in 1973.
Before the bridge was built, the only way vehicles could access Roosevelt Island was by using an elevator on the Queensboro Bridge. The elevator was torn down in 1970.
In 2001, the New York City Department of Transportation considered converting the Roosevelt Island Bridge into a fixed bridge. This was to reduce the cost of its maintenance. The bridge is rarely opened (raised for ships to go underneath), because most ships passing by Roosevelt Island use the West Channel of the East River. Most of the bridge openings occur in September during the General Assembly at the United Nations. During this time the West Channel is closed for security reasons.
When the bridge is raised for ships to go underneath, the distance between the water and the bridge is . The bridge is wide. Its total length, including approaches, is . The main span (distance across) is long.
The Roosevelt Island Bridge provides direct access to the 'Motorgate Parking Garage', which was designed to minimize vehicle traffic on the island. The garage was completed in 1974 and later expanded in 1990.

Old English poetry

The earliest known English poem is a hymn on the creation. Bede says this was by Cædmon (flourished 658–680). He was, according to legend, an illiterate herdsman who produced poetry at a monastery at Whitby. This is probably the earliest written Anglo-Saxon poetry we have.
Much of the poetry of the period is difficult to date, or even to arrange chronologically. Estimates for the date of the great epic "Beowulf" range from AD 608 through to AD 1000, and there has never been agreement. 
It is possible to identify some key moments. "The Dream of the Rood" was written before about AD 700, when parts were carved in runes on the Ruthwell Cross. Some poems on historical events, such as "The Battle of Brunanburh" (937) and "The Battle of Maldon" (991), seem to have been written shortly after the events, so they can be dated reasonably precisely.
Anglo-Saxon poetry is known by the manuscripts in which it survives. The most important manuscripts are from the late 10th and early 11th centuries. They are known as the Cædmon manuscript, the Vercelli Book, the Exeter Book, and the Beowulf manuscript.
"Beowulf" is the only heroic epic to have survived in its entirety, but fragments of others show that it was not unique in its time. Other genres include much religious verse, from devotional works to biblical paraphrase. 
With one notable exception (the so-called "Rhyming Poem"), Anglo-Saxon poetry depends on alliteration for its structure. Any rhyme included is just ornamental.

Vertical-lift bridge

A vertical-lift bridge or lift bridge is a type of movable bridge in which a span rises vertically while remaining parallel with the road surface.
The vertical lift offers several benefits over other movable bridges such as the bascule and swing-span bridge. They are generally easier to design and easier to build. They usually cost less to build for longer moveable spans. The counterweights in a vertical lift bridges are only required to be equal to the weight of the deck. Bascule bridge counterweights must weigh several times as much as the span being lifted. As a result, heavier materials can be used in the deck, and so this type of bridge is especially suited for heavy railroad use.
Although most vertical-lift bridges use towers, each with counterweights. Some use hydraulic jacks located below the deck. An example is the span bridge at St Paul Avenue in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. Another design used balance beams to lift the deck with pivoting bascules located on the top of the lift towers. An example of this kind is the La Salle Street Bridge in Chicago, Illinois, USA.
The biggest disadvantage to the vertical-lift bridge is the height restriction for ships passing under it. This is a result of the deck remaining suspended above the water.

It was used to mean the laws of the kingdom. This was distinct from Roman law or civil law. In the United States, the Constitution declares it is the "supreme law of the land." It is the same as due process of law as justified by the Constitution.
While the Magna Carta first used the term, it did not actually become the law of the land until the reign of Edward I of England. It became closely associated with another phrase that helped define the law of the land' due process. During the reign of Edward II the Liberty of Subjects Act of 1354 stated:

Accounting software

Accounting software is a program that can run on a computer to track the total value of a company. Accounting software can be downloaded to a computer or can be used through a browser window by logging into a website.
Before computers all accounting information was stored in books called "ledgers". A general ledger was the book where the accountant wrote down all payments that came into a company and all payments that were made. A common term for keeping track of this information is called "keeping the books". A bookkeeper is another term for an accountant, but can sometimes means a person who does accounting but maybe doesn't have as much formal education as an accountant.
Accounting software can automate many of the more menial tasks of accounting. For example, many accounting software companies automatically pull in bank information. Instead of having to put in the payments made and cashed received, the program does it for you.

This makes him think he was right about karma. He believes if he does good things to other people, good things will come to him. He uses his winnings to right his former wrongs, one at a time.

Foundation series

The "Foundation" series is a series of seven science fiction stories written by Isaac Asimov. They follow on from each other. 
"Foundation" was originally a series of eight short stories published in "Astounding Magazine" between May 1942 and January 1950. According to Asimov, the premise was based on ideas set forth in Edward Gibbon's "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire".
Asimov wrote the three books "Foundation", "Foundation and Empire" and the "Second Foundation" in 19501952. They dealt with a remarkable two-part idea. The Foundation was a research project, run by advanced social forecasting and social planning. It is based on the ideas of the character called Hari Seldon. Seldon developed "psychohistory". This method predicts the future, but only on a large scale. Seldon foresees the fall of the Galactic Empire, which includes the entire Milky Way, and a dark age lasting 30,000 years before a second great empire arises. 
"Foundation and Empire" tells how the Empire was destroyed, and what followed. 
The Foundation takes over what remains of the Empire, and applies its social science methods. The now peaceful galaxy is disrupted by an unpredictable event. A mysterious person arises. He is known only as "the Mule". The Mule is a mutant, and can sense and manipulate the emotions of others, often creating fear. He uses this ability to take over the independent systems bordering the Foundation, and conquers the Galaxy.
"Second Foundation" is about the Mule's search for the Second Foundation, which has been tucked away in a hard-to-find part of the galaxy. As the Mule comes closer to finding it, the mysterious Second Foundation comes out of hiding to face him. It is a collection of the most intelligent humans in the galaxy. Using its strongest minds, the Second Foundation wears down the Mule. His destructive attitude is adjusted to a benevolent one. He returns to rule over his kingdom peacefully for the rest of his life, without any further thought of conquering the Second Foundation.
Thirty years later, he wrote the sixth and seventh books that tell what happened later. Then he wrote the first and second books that tell what happened before.
The books in order of the plot are:
An account of the series is as follows:
10,000 years in the future, all humans in the Galaxy live in an empire, ruled by an Emperor on the planet Trantor. Hari Seldon, a scientist, arrives on Trantor to give a talk. He has an idea that the history of the human race can be predicted by mathematics, but the problem is too much for him alone. Seldon can see that the fall of the empire is coming and wants to help preserve the science of humans.
With the assistance of Dors Venabili, Yugo Amaryl and many others, Seldon spends his whole life to create a ‘Foundation’. This foundation is a colony of scientists on Terminus, which is an isolated planet far away from Trantor. Their job is to become the foundation for a new empire. He is also assisted by Eto Demerzel, a high government official, who is secretly a robot named Daneel Olivaw. Daneel is many thousands of years old. Seldon asks his grand-daughter Wanda, who has unusual mental powers, to help create a secret Second Foundation.
After Seldon’s death, the people on Terminus create new and powerful technology. They take over nearby planets and start trading with other planets. The Foundation fights the armies of the empire that attack them, but as Seldon thought would happen, the empire armies are defeated.
A mysterious man, known only as the Mule, has begun taking over planets belonging to the Foundation with his armies. No-one has seen him and no one knows how he manages to conquer them. Ebling Mis, a scientist, thinks he has discovered the reason; the Mule has mental powers that help him to make his enemies loyal to him. Mis has also discovered where the Second Foundation is located, but dies before he can tell anyone. 
The leader of the secretive Second Foundation, who also has strong mental powers, comes face-to-face with the Mule, and adjusts his mind so that he will not conquer anymore and will leave the Foundation alone.
Golan Trevize, a politician on Terminus, travels by spaceship with Janov Pelorat, to find the Second Foundation. They visit many planets but find no evidence of it. But Pelorat thinks that it may exist on the planet known as Earth. 
Meanwhile, Stor Gendibal, a prominent member of the Second Foundation, discovers that people with mental powers – known as Mentalics – exist. They are a force as powerful as the Mule was and more powerful than the Second Foundation are. 
Trevize and Pelorat discover a planet called Gaia, which is inhabited solely by Mentalics. Trevize is made to decide what the future of the galaxy will be. Gaia plans to absorb the entire Galaxy into one shared intellect. Gendibal is sent back home to the Second Foundation, which is actually secretly based on Trantor.
Trevize and Pelorat continue with the search for Earth with an inhabitant of Gaia known as Bliss. They search for a long time and eventually discover Earth. Earth no longer has any people living on it. They travel to the Earth's satellite, known as the Moon. There they meet a robot named Daneel Olivaw.
Olivaw explains that he has been guiding human history for thousands of years, and that he helped Seldon to set up the original foundations. This is the reason why the Seldon plan has remained on course. Olivaw tells them that his electronic brain cannot last much longer and that he is going to die. He explains that must combine his mind with an organic (human) mind before this happens.
Isaac Asimov planned to continue the stories, but was unable to do so. But other authors have written stories to tell what happened next.

Kepler's Laws

Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three laws that describe the motion of planets around the sun:
Johannes Kepler found these laws, between 1609 and 1619. 
Kepler's laws improve the model of Copernicus. If the eccentricities of the planetary orbits are taken as zero, then Kepler basically agrees with Copernicus:
The eccentricities of the orbits of those planets known to Copernicus and Kepler are small, so the rules above give good approximations of planetary motion; but Kepler's laws fit the observations better than Copernicus's.
Kepler's corrections are not at all obvious:
The eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth makes the time from the March equinox to the September equinox, around 186 days, unequal to the time from the September equinox to the March equinox, around 179 days. A diameter would cut the orbit into equal parts, but the plane through the sun parallel to the equator of the earth cuts the orbit into two parts with areas in a 186 to 179 ratio, so the eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth is approximately
which is close to the correct value (0.016710219) (see Earth's orbit).
The calculation is correct when perihelion, the date the Earth is closest to the Sun, falls on a solstice. The current perihelion, near January 4, is fairly close to the solstice of December 21 or 22.

Lake Chad shrank as much as 95% from about 1963 to 1998, but "the 2007 (satellite) image shows significant improvement over previous years". Lake Chad is economically important. It provides water to over 68 million people in the four countries surrounding it: Chad, Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria. It is on the edge of the Sahara Desert. It is the largest lake in the Chad Basin, the largest drainage basin in Africa.
Fossils of an important extinct hominid were found in the dried lakebed of Lake Chad. This was "Sahelanthropus tchadensis". From evidence at the fossil site in Chad, it is thought to have lived about seven million years ago.

Each goal had specific targets, and dates for reaching those targets. To help progress, the G8 finance ministers agreed in June 2005 to provide enough funds to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) to cancel $40 to $55 billion in debt owed by poor countries. This was to allow them to use resources for improving health, education and reducing poverty.
Developed countries' aid for the MDGs rose during the period. More than half went for debt relief. Much of the rest went towards natural disaster relief and military aid, instead of development.

The UEFA Super Cup is a match organised by UEFA. It is played every year. The winner of the UEFA Champions League plays against the winner of the UEFA Europa League. It is played in the middle of August.
The UEFA Super Cup started in 1972, with the winner of the Champions Cup playing against the winner of the European Cup Winners' Cup. It was not recognized by UEFA because it had a team that was banned from UEFA competitions, Rangers F.C.. Since there was no stadium chosen to host the game, they played one match at one team's stadium, and one match at the other's. In 1973, the first Super Cup final to be recognized by UEFA was played between Ajax and Milan. On aggregate (the added score from the 2 matches), Ajax won 6-1.
In 1991, the UEFA Super Cup between Manchester United and Red Star Belgrade was only played at Old Trafford (Manchester United's stadium) because of the war in Yugoslavia. In 1992, the Champions Cup was renamed the UEFA Champions League. In 1995, the European Cup Winners' Cup was renamed the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. The tournament was made the same. In 1998, the tournament was made 1 match with a host stadium. In 1999, The Cup Winners' Cup was ended by UEFA. The last Super Cup to be played with the winner of the Cup Winners' Cup was between Manchester United, winners of the Champions League, and Lazio, the winners of the last ever Cup Winners' Cup. Lazio won 1-0. In the year 2000, the Cup Winners' Cup was replaced in the Super Cup by the UEFA Cup. The first match to be played this way was between Real Madrid, the winners of the Champions League, and Galatasaray S.K., winners of the UEFA Cup. Galatasaray won 2-1.
In 2009, the UEFA Cup was renamed the UEFA Europa League. The tournament stayed the same.

A Fall of Moondust

A Fall of Moondust is a science fiction novel written by Arthur C. Clarke. It was first published in 1961 and has been reprinted many times.
The story takes place on the Moon in the near future. A group of tourists are travelling on the surface of the moon, which is covered by a thin layer of very fine dust, a fine powder drier (it contains less water) than a desert on Earth. The tourists are travelling in a vessel called "Selene", that skims along the surface.
A 'moonquake' (similar to an earthquake) causes the dust to collapse, and "Selene" sinks below the surface. They cannot make contact with Control to call for help, and they only have enough air for a few days. The people are also generating heat, which is dangerous.
Captain Pat Harris and his stewardess Sue Wilkins try to keep the passengers occupied while waiting to be rescued. They are helped by a retired explorer, Commodore Hansteen.
Back at control, Chief Engineer Lawrence prepares to search for the lost tourists, although he doesn't think it can be done in time. But the trail left by Selene is seen by telescope from a satellite high above the Moon. The rescue attempt goes ahead.
Lawrence and his team do find the sunken ship and dig down through the dust to cut a hole in the hull. The tourists are able to climb out to safety, but with seconds to spare before Selene fills with dust and also catches fire.
Pat Harris and Sue Wilkins get married.

Warren Commission

The President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, known unofficially as the Warren Commission, was established by President Lyndon B. Johnson on November 29, 1963. Its purpose was to the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy that had taken place on November 22, 1963. 
The Commission took its unofficial name—the Warren Commission—from its chairman, Chief Justice Earl Warren. According to published Transcripts of Johnson's presidential telephone conversations, some major officials did not want to form this commission. Also that several commission members took part only reluctantly. One of their chief reservations was that a commission would create more controversy and people's fears would be proved valid.
The 88th U.S. Congressional session passed Senate joint resolution 137 authorizing the Presidential appointed Commission to report on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
Its 889-page final report was presented to President Johnson on September 24, 1964. It was made public three days later. It concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald. They also stated that Oswald acted entirely alone. The commission said that Jack Ruby also acted alone when he killed Oswald two days later. The Commission's findings have proven controversial. They have been both challenged and supported by later studies.

However, it can be prevented by vaccines. The disease is best-known for causing meningitis. It also causes blood infection, which then leads to sepsis. 
There are over 2,600 cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States per year. In developing countries, there are over 333,000 cases per year. The case death rate is between ten and twenty percent.
Meningococcal disease is not as spreadable as the common cold. However, it can be passed between people through saliva.

Christmas carol

A Christmas carol (also called a noël, from the French word meaning "Christmas") is a carol (song or hymn) whose lyrics are on the theme of Christmas. They are traditionally sung on Christmas itself or during the surrounding holiday season. 
Carols were first sung thousands of years ago in Europe. They were sung by pagans at the celebration of the Winter solstice. Later, medieval carols were sung in elaborate formal rituals (such as the Catholic Mass). As they are known today, Christmas carols date back to about the 19th century. The tradition of going from house to house was not a part of Christmas caroling at first. It dates back further to Anglo-Saxon traditions. the word "wassail" comes from the Anglo-Saxon toast "Wæs þu hæl", meaning "be in good health". Wassailing likely predates the Norman conquest in 1066. The wishing of good fortune to neighbors produced the song "Here We Come-A-Wassailing". Another song, "We Wish You a Merry Christmas", also comes from the Wassailing tradition. The two forms, singing and wassailing, came together during the Victorian era in England. They produced the modern custom of Christmas caroling.
In the 1680s and 1690s, two French composers added carols into their works. Louis-Claude Daquin wrote 12 noels for the organ. Marc-Antoine Charpentier wrote a few instrumental versions of noels, plus one major choral work "Messe de minuit pour Noël". Other examples include:

A Study in Scarlet

A Study in Scarlet is a detective mystery novel written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It introduces his new characters, the detective Sherlock Holmes and his friend, Dr. John Watson. They became two of the most famous characters in literature.
Conan Doyle wrote the story in 1886, and it was published the next year. Holmes describes the story's murder investigation as his "study in scarlet": "There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it". 
The story and its main characters attracted little public interest when it first appeared. It was published in "Beeton's Christmas Annual" for 1887. Only 11 complete copies of the Annual exist now, and they have considerable value. Although Conan Doyle wrote 56 short stories about Holmes, "A Study in Scarlet" is one of only four full-length Holmes novels. The novel was followed by "The Sign of the Four", published in 1890. 
"A Study in Scarlet" was the first work of detective fiction to have the magnifying glass as an investigative tool.

Jessie Hill

Jessie Hill (December 9, 1932 – September 17, 1996) was an American R&B and Louisiana blues singer and songwriter. He was best known for his popular call and response song "Ooh Poo Pah Doo". As a singer, he recorded a successful single. In addition to his original, there have been over 100 cover versions made by other artists.
Hill was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. While still a teenager, he played drums in local bands. In 1951, while still drumming, he started his own group, the House Rockers. At first, Professor Longhair played piano, then later it was Huey "Piano" Smith. Hill got different musicians for the House Rockers in 1958, and started singing.
The idea for the song "Ooh Poo Pah Doo" began from some music played by a local pianist, who had the nickname Big Four. Hill wrote the lyrics and melody. Over time, while performing it on stage, it became a longer song. Hill also added an opening part written by Dave Bartholomew. In the end, the song became "a nonsensical yet rollicking call-and-response workout that perfectly captures the energy of French Quarter life...".
Hill recorded a demo that he shopped to local record labels, finally recording a session at Cosimo Matassa's studio. The record was produced by Allen Toussaint. When it was released in early 1960, it became popular, especially during Mardi Gras in New Orleans. That year, the record sold 800,000 copies and reached the Top 5 in the US "Billboard" R&B chart. It was in the Top 30 in the "Billboard" Hot 100 pop chart as well. There have been over 100 cover versions of "Ooh Poo Pah Doo" recorded and performed live over the years by other popular musicians.
Other records he made in New Orleans were not as successful. He then moved to California and worked with other musicians from New Orleans, including Harold Battiste and Mac Rebennack. Songs he wrote there were recorded by Ike Turner and Tina Turner, (singing together as "Ike & Tina Turner"), Sonny Bono and Cher (singing together as "Sonny & Cher") and Willie Nelson.
Stil living in California, a 1972 solo album was not successful at all. He ended up living in poverty and had a drinking problem. He moved back to New Orleans in 1977. He continued to drink alcohol and use narcotics. After he was arrested for drunk driving, he could no longer earn money driving his black Cadillac as a taxi. For a while he was homeless. There were several benefit concerts given to try to help him, but he did not recover from his failures.
Hill died of heart and renal failure in New Orleans in September 1996. He was 63. He is buried in Holt Cemetery in New Orleans, in a grave for the poorest citizens of the city.
Two of his grandsons are James and Troy "Trombone Shorty" Andrews. The pair performed "Ooh Poo Pah Doo" in Episode 7 of the HBO series "Treme". A third grandson, Travis "Trumpet Black" Hill, also performed as a trumpet player in New Orleans. He died from an infection while on tour in Tokyo on May 4, 2015.

Congruence (geometry)

In geometry, two figures or objects are congruent if they have the same shape and size. Also if one has the same shape and size as the mirror image of the other. 
More formally, two sets of points are called congruent if, and only if, one can be transformed into the other by isometry. For isometry, "rigid motions" are used. 
This means that one object can be repositioned and reflected (but not resized) so it coincides exactly with the other object. So two distinct plane figures on a piece of paper are congruent if we can cut them out and then match them up completely. Turning the paper over is permitted.
Congruent polygons are polygons that if you fold a regular polygon in half that is a congruent polygon.

Mating

Mating is the pairing of opposite-sex or hermaphroditic organisms, usually for the purposes of sexual reproduction. Some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals, while other definitions extend the term to mating in plants and fungi. 
Fertilization is the fusion of gametes. Copulation is the union of the sex organs of two sexually reproducing animals for internal fertilization. 
Mating may also lead to external fertilization, as seen in amphibians, fishes and plants. For most species, mating is between two individuals of opposite sexes. 
For some hermaphroditic species, copulation is not needed because the parent organism can self-fertilize (autogamy). In some flowering plants self-pollination can happen within the same flower, and some hermaphrodite animals self-fertilize. Many gastropods are hermaphrodite, and do simultaneous copulation. So do earthworms. 
In some birds, mating includes behaviors such as nest-building and feeding offspring. The human practice of mating and artificial insemination of domesticated animals is part of animal husbandry.

This Land Is Your Land

"This Land Is Your Land" is one of the best known folk songs in the United States. Its lyrics were written by American folk singer Woody Guthrie in 1940, based on a melody that already existed. Guthrie's melody was very similar to the melody of "Oh, My Loving Brother". This was a Baptist gospel hymn that had been recorded by the Carter Family as "When the World's On Fire", and had inspired their "Little Darlin', Pal of Mine." He used the same melody for the chorus and the verses.
Guthrie did not like Irving Berlin's song "God Bless America", sung at that time by Kate Smith. Guthrie was angry with the positive (smug) attitude of the song. He thought it was not realistic and the words sounded too proud of the country. The song was popular and was being played on the radio all the time. Tired of hearing it on the radio, he wrote a response originally named "God Blessed America For Me".
Guthrie rewrote the lyrics and the title over time and the song finally became "This Land Is Your Land". He sometimes added more overtly political verses in line with his views of communism than appear in recordings or publications.
Although Gutrie wrote the song in 1940, he did not record it until 1944. The song was not published until 1945, when it was included in a mimeographed booklet of ten songs with typed lyrics and hand drawings. The booklet was sold for twenty-five cents, and was copyrighted in 1951.
The first known professionally printed publication was in 1956 by Ludlow Music (now a unit of The Richmond Organization), which administered the publishing rights to Guthrie's song. Ludlow later issued versions with piano and guitar accompaniments.
In 2002, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry.

Genome editing

Genome editing is a type of genetic engineering.
DNA is inserted, replaced, or removed from a genome using artificially engineered nucleases, or "molecular scissors". The nucleases make specific double-strand breaks (DSBs) at desired places in the genome. The cell’s own mechanisms repair the induced break(s) by natural processes. 
At present there are four families of engineered nucleases being used.
To understand the function of a gene or a protein one interferes with it in a sequence-specific way, and watches its effects on the organism. However, in some organisms it is difficult or impossible to do site-specific mutation. Therefore more indirect methods have to be used. Examples are: 
Genome editing was chosen by Nature Methods as the 2011 Method of the Year. The technique is already being used, but implanting modified embryos into a woman is not yet permitted.

Small interfering RNA

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a class of double-stranded RNA molecules, 20-25 base pairs long. 
siRNA plays many roles, but it is most notable in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, where it interferes with the expression of certain genes. Genes are only affected if they have nucleotide sequences complementary to those of the siRNA. 
siRNA functions by breaking down mRNA after transcription. This prevents translation of the gene into protein. siRNA also acts in RNAi-related pathways, e.g., as an antiviral mechanism or in shaping the chromatin structure of a genome. The complexity of these pathways is only now being worked out.

Skeletal muscle is a form of "striated" (striped) muscle tissue. It is under the voluntary control of the somatic nervous system. Most skeletal muscles are attached to bones by bundles of collagen fibers known as tendons. It is one of three muscle types, the others being cardiac muscle and smooth muscle. 
Skeletal muscle is made up of individual muscle cells or myocytes, known as "muscle fibres". Muscle fibres do the work when muscles contract. A great deal is known about their structure and how they work. They contract when they get a nerve impulse.

Cardiac muscle

Cardiac muscle (heart muscle) is striated muscle (striped muscle) in the walls of the heart. It makes up the tissue called the myocardium. It is involuntary: a person cannot control it consciously.
Cardiac muscle is one of three main types of muscle, the others being skeletal and smooth muscle. The cells that make up cardiac muscle have one (74%) or two (24.5%) nuclei. The myocardium forms a thick middle layer between the outer epicardium layer and the inner endocardium layer.
Coordinated contractions of cardiac muscle cells in the heart force blood out of the atria and ventricles to the blood vessels of the left/body/systemic and right/lungs/pulmonary circulatory systems. This mechanism illustrates systole (contraction) of the heart.
Cardiac muscle cells, unlike most other tissues in the body, rely on the coronary arteries to deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products directly. There is no time for them to diffuse.
The heart muscle can become sick and weak. For example, if a person has very high blood pressure (hypertension), part of the heart muscle can get overworked. The heart muscle becomes bigger and cannot do its job as well. This is called hypertrophy.
If a person has a problem with the electrical system that controls the heart, the heart muscle may not beat the way it needs to. It may beat too slowly to get blood out to the body (this is called bradycardia). Or it may beat so fast that the heart does not have time to fill with blood and then squeeze the blood out to the body. This is called tachycardia (there are many kinds).
The heart gets blood through the coronary arteries. These are special blood vessels that carry blood only to the heart. In order to do its job, the heart muscle needs a constant supply of blood and oxygen from the coronary arteries. If these coronary arteries get blocked, blood flow to the heart muscle can stop. Without blood flow, the heart muscle gets no oxygen. If this lasts long enough, the part of the heart muscle which is not getting enough oxygen dies. This is called a myocardial infarction, or a heart attack.

NoSQL

A very common programming language for accessing a database is called SQL. Many of these databases use the mathematical concept of relations to store the data. NoSQL is a term for databases that do not use relations, to store the data. Relational databases have the benefit of being able to guarantee that all the data stored in the database is consistent. The drawback of this is that the cost of indexing the data grows with the amount of data. 
NoSQL approaches do not give strong guarantees about consistency, but they are able to better handle the situations where relational database systems have problems coping.

McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II

The McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) AV-8B Harrier II is a single-engine ground-attack aircraft. It is the second generation of the Harrier Jump Jet family. It is capable of vertical or short takeoff and landing (V/STOL). The aircraft was designed in the late 1970s as an Anglo-American development of the British Hawker Siddeley Harrier, the first operational V/STOL aircraft. It can hover like a helicopter but can also fly like a jet at near supersonic speeds. It is named after the a bird of prey. It is primarily used on light attack or multi-role missions. These range from close air support of ground troops to armed reconnaissance. The AV-8B is used by the United States Marine Corps (USMC), the Spanish Navy, and the Italian Navy. A variant of the AV-8B, the British Aerospace Harrier II, was developed for the British military. Another is the TAV-8B, is a dedicated two-seat trainer.
The project that eventually led to the AV-8B's creation started in the early 1970s. It was a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom (UK). it was aimed at working on solving the problems of the first-generation Harrier. Early efforts centered on a larger, more powerful Pegasus engine to improve the Harrier's performance. The UK dropped out of the project in 1975.
Following the withdrawal of the UK, McDonnell Douglas extensively redesigned the earlier AV-8A Harrier to create the AV-8B. While retaining the general layout of its predecessor, the aircraft uses a new wing, an elevated cockpit, a redesigned fuselage, one extra hardpoint per wing, and other structural and aerodynamic changes. The aircraft is powered by an upgraded version of the Pegasus, which gives the aircraft its V/STOL ability. The AV-8B made its maiden flight in November 1981 and entered service with the USMC in January 1985. Later upgrades added a night-attack capability and radar. This resulted in the AV-8B(NA) and AV-8B Harrier II Plus, respectively. An enlarged version named Harrier III was also studied, but was not built. The UK, through British Aerospace, re-joined the improved Harrier project as a partner in 1981. After corporate mergers in the 1990s, Boeing and BAE Systems have jointly supported the program. Approximately 340 aircraft were produced in a 22-year production program that ended in 2003.

Pevensey

Pevensey is a village and civil parish in the Wealden district of East Sussex, England. The main village is located 5 miles (8 km) north-east of Eastbourne, one mile (1.6 km) inland from Pevensey Bay. The settlement of Pevensey Bay forms part of the parish. It was here that William the Conqueror first landed on and invaded England in 1066 after crossing the English Channel from Normandy, France.
The name "Pevensey" was first recorded in 947 as "Pefenesea", meaning "River of [a man named] Pefen". It comes from the Anglo-Saxon personal name "Pefen" plus "eã", meaning "river". This is probably a reference to the now largely silted-up marshes.
In the 4th century the Romans built a fort at Pevensey, which they named Anderitum. Pevensey village was just outside the fort. Around 491, after the Romans left, Saxons began moving to the south coast. They besieged Anderitum over a number of years. After a long struggle the British defences were overrun. The old Roman fort of Anderida was burned and left in ruins. In 1042, Harold Godwinson, later Harold II of England, established a stronghold here. 
When William the Conqueror invaded Sussex in September 1066, there were no defenders at Pevensey. The bay provided a safe haven for the invading Norman fleet. The English army had been awaiting Duke William's arrival on the south coast all summer. With supplies running short King Harold allowed his soldiers to return home. When Harald Hardrada the king of Norway invaded northern England in late September, King Harold gathered his army and moved north to York, 250 miles away, to meet the invaders. William, meanwhile, moved his army and fleet to Hastings and built a fort while he awaited Harold and his army. Hastings was a cinque port and with the fort could allow the Norman army to leave England quicker if they were defeated.
After the Battle of Hastings the Roman fort at Pevensey was occupied by the Normans. It was granted to Robert, Count of Mortain (half brother to William). Robert de Mortain built his castle there. The castle was besieged several times during the 11th–13th centuries. Queen Elizabeth I ordered that it be demolished but the order was ignored. As late as 1942 small additions were made to the castle for the defence of Britain. It became a lookout over the channel for German aircraft during World War II. Today the castle is in the upkeep of English Heritage.

The United States courts of appeals (or circuit courts) are the appellate courts of the Federal judiciary of the United States. A court of appeals decides appeals from the district courts within its federal judicial circuit. In some cases it decides appeals from other designated federal courts and administrative agencies.
The United States courts of appeals are considered among the most and courts in the United States. They have the ability to set legal precedent that affect millions of Americans. The United States courts of appeals have strong influence on U.S. law. The U.S. Supreme Court chooses to review less than 1% of the more than 10,000 cases filed with it ly. This means the United States courts of appeals makes the final decision in most federal cases. The Ninth Circuit in particular is very influential. It covers 20% of the American population.
There are currently 179 judges on the United States courts of appeals. These judges are d by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate. They have lifetime tenure, earning an annual salary of $213,300. There are thirteen United States courts of appeals. There are other tribunals that have "Court of Appeals" in their titles, such as the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. They hear appeals in court-martial cases. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims reviews final decisions by the Board of Veterans' Appeals in the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
Decisions of the United States courts of appeals have been published by the private company West Publishing in the "Federal Reporter" series since the courts were established. Only decisions that the courts chooses for publication are included. The "unpublished" opinions (of all but the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits) are published separately in West's "Federal Appendix". They are also available in on-line databases like LexisNexis or Westlaw. More recently, court decisions are also available electronically on the official court websites. However, there are also a few federal court decisions that are classified for national security reasons.
There are eleven ed circuits which are numbered one through eleven. The D.C. Circuit is the twelfth. The thirteenth court of appeals is the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. It has nationwide jurisdiction over certain appeals based on their subject matter. All of the courts of appeals also hear appeals from some government agency decisions and rulemaking. The largest share of these cases heard by the D.C. Circuit. The Federal Circuit hears appeals from specialized trial courts. These are primarily the United States Court of International Trade and the United States Court of Federal Claims. They also hear appeals from the district courts in patent cases and certain other specialized matters.

An appellate court, commonly called an appeals court, court of appeals (American English), appeal court (British English), court of second instance or second instance court, is any court of law that hears an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal. In most jurisdictions, the court system is divided into at least three levels. The trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and to determine the facts of the case. There is at least one intermediate appellate court. The top level is a supreme court (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts. A jurisdiction's supreme court is that jurisdiction's highest appellate court. Appellate courts nationwide can operate by varying rules.
The of appellate courts to review decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another. In some places, the appellate court has limited powers of review.

Line of Actual Control

The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is the effective border between India and China. The LAC is 4,057-km long and traverses three areas of northern Indian states: western (Ladakh, Kashmir), middle (Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh) and eastern (Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh). Quote: "India is used to incursions by Chinese troops across the 4,057-km LAC in all the three sectors—western (Ladakh), middle (Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh) and eastern (Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh)— in a bid to strengthen China's claim over disputed areas and ensure New Delhi does not change its Tibet policy."
Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai used the phrase in a letter addressed to Indian Prime Minister Nehru dated October 24, 1959. In a letter dated November 7, Zhou told Nehru that the LAC consisted of "the so-called McMahon Line in the east and the line up to which each side exercises actual control in the west". During the Sino-Indian War (1962), Nehru claimed not to know where the line was: "There is no sense or meaning in the Chinese offer to withdraw twenty kilometers from what they call 'line of actual control'. What is this 'line of control'? Is this the line they have created by aggression since the beginning of September? Advancing forty or sixty kilometers by blatant military aggression and offering to withdraw twenty kilometers provided both sides do this is a deceptive device which can fool nobody." It should be noted that these incursions were in response to India's "forward policy" in which India began to contest areas controlled by China, including some that were not included in the McMahon Line.

Tupí people

The Tupí people were an important ethnic group of indigenous peoples in Brazil. Scholars believe they first settled in the Amazon rainforest. Later, they started to move to the south and settled on the Atlantic coast.
The Tupí people were living in almost all of the Brazilian coast when the Portuguese first arrived there. In 1500, their population was estimated to be 1 million people. They were divided into tribes, each tribe numbering from 300 to 2,000 people. Some of these tribes are: "Tupiniquim", "Tupinambá", "Potiguara", "Tabajara", "Caetés", "Temiminó", "Tamoios".
The Tupí had agriculture. They grew cassava, corn, sweet potatoes, beans, peanuts, tobacco, squash, cotton and many other crops.
After the 16th century, the Tupí were assimilated, made to work as slaves, or killed by diseases such as smallpox or by Portuguese settlers and Bandeirantes (colonial Brazilian scouts). Except for a few communities, nearly all the Tupí were killed. Today, the descendants of the survivors live on Indian reservations or are part of the dominant Brazilian society.
The Tupí were divided into several tribes which would constantly engage in war with each other. In these wars, the Tupí would try to capture their enemies to later kill and eat them.
They believed that they would gain the strength of the warriors they eat. The Tupí also ate the remains of dead relatives.
Cannibalism by the Tupí decreased after European contact and religious intervention. When Cabeza de Vaca, a Spanish conquistador, arrived in Santa Catarina in 1541, for instance, he attempted to ban cannibalism.
Some scholars question whether the Tupí actually engaged in cannibalism. They do not think the sources that talk about cannibalism, mostly written by Europeans, are reliable.
In the 16th century, the Tupi were the first group to have contact with the Portuguese. The Portuguese colonists did not bring many women, so miscegenation between Portuguese settlers and indigenous women started. The Tupi had a tradition, called "Cunhadismo", of incorporating strangers to their community. The Indians offered the Portuguese an Indian girl as wife. Once he agreed, he formed a bond of kinship with all the Indians of the tribe. The settlers also adopted the Indian practice of polygyny.
The relatives of an Indian woman would have to work for her husband. If a settler had many Indian wives, he would have a large number of Indian relatives who would have to work for him. They would mostly have to cut wood and take it to the ships on the coast. Since there were not a lot of Portuguese women in Brazil, intermarriage made it easier for the Portuguese to colonize the country.
Although most of the Tupí population died, a large population with Tupí-Portuguese ancestry occupied much of Brazilian territory. They continued the ancient Tupí traditions in several points of the country. Darcy Ribeiro wrote that the first Brazilians looked more like the Tupí than the Portuguese. The language that they spoke, called Nheengatu or Língua Geral, was based on Tupí.
Eventually, Brazilian society started to lose its Tupi characteristics. Língua Geral was replaced by the Portuguese language. Indian ways of making things were replaced by European ones. Brazilian Portuguese absorbed many words from Tupi.

Victor Skumin

Victor Andreevich Skumin () (born 30 August 1948) is a Russian psychologist, psychiatrist, psychotherapist, medical doctor and writer.
Victor Skumin was born on 30 August 1948 in Penza Oblast, Russia. His father, Andrew Skumin, was a KGB officer. 
Skumin studied medicine at the Kharkov National Medical University. He graduated the University in 1973 with diploma with honours.
In 1976, he became a psychotherapist in Kiev Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery. Skumin was the first to described a previously unknown disease, now it is called "Skumin syndrome".
From 1980 to 1990, he has been professor of psychotherapy at the Kharkov Medical Academy of Postgraduate education. During this period Skumin investigated borderline mental disorders in chronic diseases of the digestive system in children and adolescents.
From 1990 to 1994, Skumin held positions as Professor by the Chair of Psychology and Pedagogy, and Professor by the Chair of Physical Education and Health life at the Kharkov State Academy of Culture.
In 1994, Skumin became President of the World Organization of Culture of Health (WOCH) — International social movement "To Health via Culture" (Russian: Междунаро́дное обще́ственное Движе́ние «К Здоро́вью че́рез Культу́ру»). In 1995, Skumin became the first editor-in-chief of the journal "To Health via Culture". This journal of the World Organisation of Culture of Health (″World Health Culture Organization″) received an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) 0204-3440. The main topics of the magazine are the dissemination of ideas of Culture of Health, holistic medicine, and Buddhism.
In the Russian Orthodox Church the social activities of this international organization qualifies as an ideology of the New Age.
In 1968, when Skumin was still a medical student, he proposed the term ″culture of health″ (Russian: ″Культу́ра Здоро́вья″.), which has become widespread. The main task of the culture of health is to do health programs that support a holistic approach to physical, mental and spiritual well-being.
The 'culture of health' means recognizing health’s central importance in life. Skumin referred to the works of Helena Blavatsky, Helena and Nicholas Roerich, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, and Alexander Chizhevsky. In some of his publications, he argues that the culture of health will play an important role in the creation of a human spiritual society in the Solar System.
The doctrine of a culture of health, proposed by Skumin, the culture – spiritual, mental, and physical – determines the status of human health. And health – spiritual, mental, physical – is a prerequisite for achieving a higher level of culture.
"Skumin syndrome" ()) was described by Skumin in 1978 as a "cardioprosthetic psychopathological syndrome", associated with mechanical heart valve implant and manifested by irrational fear, anxiety, depression and sleep disorder. This syndrome is often accompanied by asthenia. 
Alain Carpentier – a member of the French Academy of Sciences and the head the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery at the Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou in Paris – believed in 2011 that Skumin syndrome develops in a quarter of the patients with an artificial heart valve. It is possible that a similar problem arises in the conduct of operations to implement an artificial heart.
In 1979, Skumin created a special modification of mind control method for psychological rehabilitation of patients. This method is based on autogenic training. Autogenic training is a relaxation technique developed by the psychiatrist Johannes Heinrich Schultz. He emphasized parallels to techniques in yoga and meditation. It is a method for influencing one's autonomic nervous system. The technique involves the daily practice of sessions that last around 15 minutes, usually in the morning, at lunch time, and in the evening. During each session, the practitioner will repeat a set of visualisations that induce a state of relaxation. Each session can be practiced in a position chosen amongst a set of recommended postures.
The technique of the Skumin mind control method (Russian: "Психотре́нинг по Ску́мину") involves the use of two standard postures: sitting meditation and lying down meditation. This method of psychotraining includes five psychological exercises: the first is "the relaxation", the second one is "the warming", the third one is "the zero gravity", the fourth one is "the target autosuggestion", and the fifth exercise is "the psychological activation". Each session contain explanation of the theory and practice of each new exercise as it is reached. The therapeutic effect is achieved by the neutralization of traumatic emotional experiences and the progressive reorganization of the psychic structures to include previously unacceptable mental contents, too. This method of psychotherapy has found application in medical practice, in particular in the treatment of phobias, headaches, etc.
Skumin proposed mixture subsequently named after him. "Skumin’s mixture" () is a medicine with a sedative effect, affecting the central nervous system. It is used to treat Skumin syndrome, light forms of heart failure, anxiety and sleep disorders, and asthenia. The medicine is known to be well tolerated, with no contra-indications, except sensitivity. The formula contains Adonis vernalis, Crataegus, Valerian root, Leonurus cardiaca, Eucalyptus, Peppermint, and Rose hip.
Skumin wrote many books and articles on a variety medical and spiritual topics advocating a holistic approach to health. He is the author or co-author of a series illustrated books on the culture of health, yoga, Roerich’s philosophy, and Buddhism. 
He is the author of music and lyrics of several songs. Among them:
Skumin was important in the Western transmission and revival of Theravada Buddhism. Today Theravada Buddhists, who are also known as Theravadins, number over 100 million worldwide; in recent decades Theravada has begun to take root in the West and in the Buddhist revival in Nepal.

Wrongful death claim

Wrongful death is a claim against a person who can be held liable for another person's death. This can be because of negligence, misconduct, or murder. Wrongful death lawsuits usually follow a criminal trial. They may use the same evidence but they have a lower standard of proof. 
The claim is brought in a civil action, usually by close relatives, based on tort laws. This is a relatively new concept. Common law did not allow for this type of lawsuit. In the United States, state and federal laws have changed during the last century to allow this kind of action.
In law, damages are an award, usually of money. It is to be paid to a person as compensation for loss or injury. Damages for wrongful death may include:
Damages may also include punitive damages which are intended to reform or the defendant and others from doing the same thing again.

An individual retirement account or IRA is a form of "individual retirement plan". It is simply a savings account with large tax advantages. An IRA is not itself an investment. It is where an investor keeps assets such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds. A 401(k) is set up by an employer. But an IRA may be started by an individual. Other IRAs may be opened by small business owners and those who are self-employed.
There are different types of IRAs: Traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, SEP-IRAs and SIMPLE IRAs. They vary as to tax filing status. Also they have different rules and s. 
A participant-directed account (also called a self-directed IRA) is an IRA which is provided by some financial institutions in the United States. It allows alternative investments for retirement savings. Some examples of such alternative investments are: real estate, private mortgages, private company stock, oil and gas limited partnerships, precious metals, horses, and intellectual property.

Defense in depth (computing)

Defense in Depth (also known as layered security and layered defense) is an information assurance (IA) concept. It uses multiple layers of security controls (defenses) placed throughout an information technology (IT) system. The multiple layers re not of the same security tool. It uses several several different kinds of security with each protecting against a different security attack.
Defense in depth is originally a military strategy. It seeks to delay rather than prevent the advance of an attacker by yielding space to buy time. The National Security Agency (NSA) changed the concept to be a approach to information and electronic security.
The placement of protection mechanisms, procedures and policies is intended to increase the dependability of an IT system. Multiple layers of defense can prevent espionage. They also prevent direct attacks against critical systems. In terms of computer network defense, defense in depth measures should not only prevent security breaches but also buy an organization time to detect and respond to an attack. This is to reduce and the consequences of a .
Defense in depth has long been explained by using the onion as an example of the various layers of security. The outer layer contains the firewall. Middle layers contain various controls. The data is in the center protected by the other defenses.
A newer concept is the kill chain. Borrowed from the military it is a method of detecting and breaking an opponent's kill chain. Lockheed Martin adapted this concept to information security, using it as a method for modeling intrusions on a computer network. 
Using more than one of the following layers constitutes defense in depth.

Mohammed Emwazi (born Muhammad Jassim Abdulkarim Olayan al-Dhafiri, 17 August 1988 – 12 November 2015) was a Kuwaiti-born British Arab terrorist. He moved to London in 1994. He was thought to be the person seen in several videos produced by the Islamic extremist group ISIL. The videos showed the beheadings of captives in 2014 and 2015. A group of his hostages nicknamed him "Jihadi John" since he was part of a four-person terrorist cell with British accents whom they called "The Beatles".
On the night of 12 November 2015, US officials reported that Emwazi had been hit by a drone strike in Al-Raqqah, Syria. The following day, UK officials stated a “high degree of certainty” that Emwazi was killed. He was declared dead later that day.

November 2015 Paris attacks

On 13–14 November 2015, a mass shooting and suicide bombing happened in Paris and Stade de France at Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis, France at the Bataclan concert venue, and at other sites. 130 people were killed. Because of this, French President François Hollande announced a national state of emergency. In his speech of 14 November, Hollande said that 128 people were killed and another 128 were gravely injured.
In total, over 350 people were injured during the attacks, about 100 of them are gravely injured. One of the attacks was at the Paris stadium, one of the others was at a theatre. The others six were at well known places in the city. At least seven people were involved in the attacks: seven were suicide bombers, one was shot by police.
The next day, November 14, ISIS claimed responsibility of the attacks. The leader of the attacks was Belgian terrorist Abdelhamid Abaaoud. He was killed in a police raid on 18 November.
France had been on high alert for terrorist threats since the "Charlie Hebdo" shooting in early January 2015 and other related incidents during the January 2015 Île-de-France attacks. France had also increased security in anticipation of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, scheduled to be held in Paris from 30 November to 11 December 2015, and had restored border checks the week before the attacks.
The "Charlie Hebdo" shooting in January 2015 occurred in the 11th arrondissement of the city, where the Bataclan theatre is situated. Other attacks in France also took place, such as the stabbing of 3 military men in Nice who were guarding a Jewish community center, the Saint-Quentin Fallavier attack and the 2015 Thalys train attack.
Islamic State and their branches have claimed responsibility for numerous deadly attacks within the weeks leading up to the attacks. On 12 November 2015, twin suicide bombings took place in Beirut, Lebanon, killing 43 people. On 31 October 2015, Metrojet Flight 9268, carrying mostly Russian passengers crashed in the Sinai in Egypt, killing 224 people. Islamic State's Sinai branch claimed responsibility. 
Also, during the day of the attacks, ISIL's lead executioner Jihadi John was reported to have been killed by a U.S. drone strike and had lost the Battle of Sinjar to Kurdish forces.
Seven distinct attacks took place, comprising six shootings and three explosions. The explosions occurred near the Stade de France, while shootings were reported in the vicinity of Rue Alibert, Rue de la Fontaine-au-Roi, Rue de Charonne, the Bataclan theatre in Boulevard Voltaire, Avenue de la République, and the Boulevard Beaumarchais.
It is likely that three teams carried out the coordinated series of attacks. 
The Islamic State officially claimed responsibility for the attacks on the morning of 14 November, praising their "eight brothers" led by Abdelhamid Abaaoud on the death of "at least 200 'crusaders'" and claiming that "this was only the beginning of the storm."
The people who committed the crime were:
The exact number of attackers is currently unclear; certain media speak of seven, others of eight attackers. Police think there might be 3-5 attackers who survived, and are on the run. About ten people were taken in police custody in Brussels, as they might have connections to the attacks. The ringleader of the attack, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was killed in a police raid in France on 18 November.
President François Hollande issued a statement asking the French people to remain strong in the face of such incidents. Hollande also visited the Bataclan theatre and vowed to "mercilessly" fight against terrorism. Hollande also chaired an emergency meeting of the French Cabinet that night, and organized his national security council to meet the next morning. The authorities urged the residents of Paris to stay indoors for their own safety. Hollande also cancelled his trip to the 2015 G-20 Antalya summit because of the attacks, instead sending Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and Finance Minister Michel Sapin as his representatives.
On 14 November, President Hollande announced three national days of mourning. Later that day, some of the names of the dead were released:
Pope Francis has condemned the attacks. He said that violence would not solve problems, and that the attacks could not be justified from a religious or humanitarian point of view. Representatives of Islam in France have also condemned the attacks, as did those of the Jewish community. Iranian president Hassan Rouhani cancelled his trip to France, and called the attacks a crime against humanity. 
There are reports of isolated acts against Muslim institutions: Red crosses were found on a mosque in Créteil, near Paris, the day after the attacks. A man of North African descent was attacked during a series of demonstrations of a right-wing group against illegal immigration.

A schnauzer is a type of dog breed that originated in Germany in about the 14th century. The Standard Schnauzer is the oldest of the three three Schnauzer varieties: Miniature, Standard, and Giant. All three varieties have the distinctive whiskers, mustache and eyebrows. 
The Standard Schnauzer is the prototype from which the other two were bred. From the middle ages on they guarded the livestock and family members. They are descended from European herding and guard dogs. As a distinctive breed, they appear in pictures of the 14th and 15th centuries. As far as can be determined they were bred from the Gray Wolf Spitz, the German poodle (pudel) and the Wirehaired Pinscher. About the middle of the 19th century German dog enthusiasts took an interest in the Schnauzer. Dog breeders experimented by crossing them with other breeds. First the Miniature Schnauzer was developed, then the Giant Schnauzer.

Odo, Earl of Kent

Odo, Earl of Kent (ca 1030 – 1097) and Bishop of Bayeux, was the half-brother of William the Conqueror. For a time he was second in power after William became King of England.
Odo was born about 1030. He was the son of William the Conqueror's mother Herleva and Herluin de Conteville. Count Robert of Mortain was his younger brother. 
Although he was an ordained Christian cleric, he is best known as a warrior and greedy nobleman. He provided 100 ships for his brother's invasion of England. Odo is one of the very few proven companions of William the Conqueror, known to have fought at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. He probably commissioned the Bayeux Tapestry. In 1067, Odo became the Earl of Kent. For several years he was a trusted royal minister. On some occasions when William was absent (back in Normandy), he served as the "de facto" regent of England. At times he led the royal forces against rebellions. There are also other occasions when he accompanied William back to Normandy. During this time Odo acquired vast estates in England. He held land in twenty-three counties, mainly in the southeast and in East Anglia.
As the Earl of Kent he became infamous for being greedy, ruthless and a tyrant. Odo obtained a large fortune in land and gold by plundering the landowners of Kent. One chronicler, Thomas of Marlborough, called him a "ravening wolf". Orderic Vitalis, writing nearly a century after Odo's death, he showed him to be a very complex man. On the one hand Odo had great . He was the perfect example of Norman oppression on a conquered England. Yet he was deeply religious and contributed to the al growth of England. Orderic wrote of him:
In 1076 Odo was placed on trial. He was accused of defrauding the Crown and the Diocese of Canterbury. At the conclusion of the trial he was forced to return a number of properties he had taken. Most of his wealth was redistributed.
In 1082, he was suddenly d and imprisoned. This time it was for having planned a military expedition to Italy. He wanted to crown himself the Pope. His brother, the king, disapproved of the plan and put a stop to it. Odo spent the next five years in prison in Rouen. His English estates were taken back by the king, as was his office as Earl of Kent. He was allowed to remain the Bishop of Bayeux, however. Odo was released from prison after William died. In 1096 Odo set off on the First Crusade with his nephew, Robert Curthose. He died in Palermo while wintering there in early 1097. He was buried in the Cathedral there.

Cortisone is a 21-carbon steroid hormone. Its chemical name is 17-hydroxy-11-dehydrocorticosterone. It is one of the main hormones released by the adrenal gland in response to stress. 
In chemical structure, it is closely related to cortisol. It is used to treat a variety of ailments and can be administered in various ways. Cortisone suppresses the immune system. This reduces inflammation, pain and swelling at the site of the injury. Long-term use of cortisone has risks.
Tadeus Reichstein, E.C. Kendall and P.S. Hench were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1950 for their discovery of cortisone.

Hello (Adele song)

"Hello" is a song recorded by English singer-songwriter Adele. It is from her third studio album, "25". It was released on 23 October 2015. The song was Adele's first since the Bond theme "Skyfall" in 2012. The song reached number one in several countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and the United States. In the US, it first appeared at the top of the "Billboard" Hot 100, becoming Adele's fourth chart-topper there, and sold over 1.112 million copies in its first week. This is the most copies of a song sold in a single week in the U.S. since the release of Elton John's "Candle in the Wind 1997". "Hello" was certified 4× Platinum in the U.S. faster than any other song in history. On September 20, 2016, the Recording Industry Association of America certified the song 7× Platinum for sales and streams equal to 7 million copies in the United States.
The song finished at number 35 on the Year-End "Billboard" Hot 100 of 2015 and at #7 on the 2016 chart. Similarly, the song ranked at number 25 on the Canadian 2015 year-end chart and at number 9 at the end of 2016.
The song was first featured in a 30-second TV commercial for "The X Factor" in the UK. She has stated that the lyrics of the song can be applied to anyone with whom one has a history — romantically or otherwise. In an interview with "i-D", she explains:
The music video was shot in Canada. It was shot in sepia. It shows Adele having a conversation on a flip phone when she suddenly loses reception. Her feelings towards a man are throughout the video. It broke the Vevo Record for most views in a single day, with over 27.7 million views. In January 2016, the music video for the song reached over one billion views on YouTube. It did this in less time (88 days) than other videos. That was faster than the music video for Psy's 2012 single "Gangnam Style".
Adele perfomed "Hello" live for the first time for a BBC one-hour-long special, "Adele at the BBC", which was recorded on 2 November and was broadcast on BBC One on 20 November. She also performed the song at the 17th NRJ Music Awards on 7 November 2015, at Radio City Music Hall in New York on 17 November 2015 as her opening number (Adele Live In New York City), and on "Saturday Night Live" on 21 November 2015. On 23 November 2015, after appearing on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Adele recorded the song with Fallon and his house band The Roots, playing classroom instruments. The version was broadcast on the show the following night. In December 2015, Adele performed "Hello" on the live final episode of "The X Factor" at Wembley Arena.

Orbital resonance

Orbital resonance is when two orbiting bodies exert a regular, periodic gravitational effect on each other. Their orbital periods may be related by a ratio of two small integers. It is caused by the changing gravitational forces of bodies which go round each other. The stability of the Solar System was first investigated by Laplace, and there is still much that is not known about it.
As a satellite goes round a planet or two stars go round each other, the gravitaional forces can change, sometimes hugely. This is partly because orbits are usually ellipses, not circular, and so the forces change accordingly. Also, the planets and stars are usually not spherical. They spin, and vary in their degree of oblateness. This also changes the forces on an orbiting body.
In particular, the forces may be unstable, so the smaller partner may change until the forces are stable (do not change with time). Satellites often end up with one face towards their planet, because that is the most stable position (tidal locking). There are other stability effects. Gaps in Saturn's rings are caused by the particles shifting into more stable positions. In the rings of Saturn, the Cassini Division is a gap between the inner B Ring and the outer A Ring. It was cleared by a 2:1 resonance with the moon Mimas. There is a stability ratio for Neptune and Pluto: the 2:3 ratio means Pluto completes two orbits in the time it takes Neptune to complete three.
The area of mechanics which is used for these studies is called celestial mechanics.

They are the only international side with a winning record against every country they have played. Since their international debut in 1903 only five nations have defeated New Zealand in test matches. Since the introduction of the World Rugby Rankings in October 2003, New Zealand has held the number one ranking longer than all other teams combined. The All Blacks are also the first team to set their hands on the Webb Ellis Cup. the first team to successfully defend the Rugby World Cup. They were the first team to win back to back Rugby World Cups and the first team to win the cup on 3 separate occasions.
New Zealand competes with Argentina, Australia and South Africa in The Rugby Championship. The All Blacks have won the trophy thirteen times in the competition's nineteen-year history. They also hold the Bledisloe Cup, which is contested annually with Australia. They hold the Freedom Cup, contested annually with South Africa. New Zealand has achieved a Grand Slam (defeating England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in one tour) four times1978, 2005, 2008 and 2010.
They have also been named the "World Rugby Team of the Year" seven times since 2005. Four members have won the "World Rugby Player of the Year" awardcurrent captain Richie McCaw, Dan Carter, Kieran Read, and Brodie Retallick. Fifteen former All Blacks have been inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame. Four of these are also inductees of the World Rugby Hall of Fame.
The team's first match was in 1884. Their first international match was in 1903 against Australia in Sydney. The following year they hosted their first ever home Test, a match against a British Isles side in Wellington. This was followed by a tour of Europe and North America in 1905 where the team suffered their first test defeatto Wales in Cardiff.

Derogation

Derogation (Latin "derogatio") is the partial ing of a law. This is as opposed to a repeal or ending of a law. The term is used in both civil law and common law. It is sometimes used, loosely, to mean abrogation. For example in the legal maxim: "Lex posterior derogat priori" which means a more recent law may overrule an earlier law. Derogation is different from dispensation (an to a law) in that it applies to the law. A dispensation applies to specific people who are affected by the law.
In terms of European Union legislation, a derogation can also imply that a member state delays putting into effect a part of an European Union regulation (etc.) into their own legal system. This can be for a period of time such as five years. Or that a member state has decided not to enforce a specific provision in a treaty due to internal circumstances (typically a state of emergency).

<doc id="522189" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=522189" title="Repeal">
Repeal

A repeal is the or of a law. There are two basic types of repeal. A repeal with re- (or ) of the repealed law, or a repeal without replacement. The move to , repeal, or is used in parliamentary procedure to cancel or an action or order previously adopted by the assembly. Removal of secondary legislation is normally referred to as rather than repeal in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Under the common law of England and Wales, the effect of repealing a statute was "to it completely from the records of Parliament as though it had never been passed." This, however, is now subject to savings provisions within the Interpretation Act 1978.
A partial repeal occurs when a specified part or of a previous act is repealed but other provisions remain in force. For example, the Acts of Union 1800, providing for the union between the formerly separate kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland as the United Kingdom, was partially repealed in 1922. This was when (as a consequence of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty), twenty-six of the thirty-two counties of Ireland were constituted as the Irish Free State, and ceased to be part of the United Kingdom.
A full repeal occurs where the entire Act in question is repealed.
A typical situation where an Act is repealed and re-enacted is where the law in the area is being updated but the law being repealed needs to be replaced with one suitable for the modern era. Re-enactment can be with or without amendment. However, repeal and re-enactment without amendment normally occurs only in the context of a Consolidation Bill (a bill to consolidate the law in a particular area).
For example the repeal of the Poor Laws in England in 1948 reflected their replacement by modern social welfare legislation.
A repeal without replacement is generally done when a law is no longer effective, or it is shown that a law is having far more negative consequences than were originally envisioned. Many repeals without replacement are the result of significant changes in society. Major examples include:

Marie Jean Pierre Flourens (13 April 1794 – 6 December 1867) proved that the effects of "the mind" were caused by the brain, not the heart.
He was a French physiologist, the founder of experimental brain science and a pioneer in anesthesia. He use brain surgery on animals, and studied their effects. His kind of surgery is called "ablative surgery": in most cases ablative brain surgery does not mean removing brain tissue, but rather destroying tissue and leaving it in place.
In 1825, Flourens pioneered the experimental method of ablating parts of the brain in living rabbits and pigeons. He carefully observed their effects. His intention was to find out whether different parts of the brain had different functions.
Flourens was able to show for the first time that the main parts of the brain were responsible for largely different functions. By removing the cerebral hemispheres, for instance, all perceptions, voluntary action, and judgment were abolished. The removal of the cerebellum affected the animal's equilibrium and motor coordination, while the destruction of the brainstem (medulla oblongata) caused death. These experiments led Flourens to conclude that:

Primary and secondary legislation

In parliamentary systems of government, primary legislation and secondary legislation are two forms of law. Primary legislation consists of Acts of Parliament or statute. Secondary legislation (also called delegated legislation) is the granting of additional law-making powers to another branch of government by an Act or statute. In the European Union, primary and secondary legislation are two of the three processes of law. The third is supplementary law which includes International law and covers any gaps between primary and secondary legislation.
In parliamentary systems, of three branches of government—executive, legislative and judicial—the legislative branch is the most powerful. In other forms of government, such as democracy for example, the three branches of government are equal in power. When a parliament makes a law, called an , it is ing on the other two branches of government. Acts are made by a majority vote of the legislature. The exact process differs in different parliamentary systems. In a bicameral (two-chamber) system there is usually a lower house (such as the House of Commons in the UK) and an upper house (such as the House of Lords). A new law starts out as a bill, usually in the lower house. It must pass both houses before it can become an act. Other systems use a unicameral or one-chamber legislation. In either system, an act becomes the law. Judges and the courts have almost no authority to challenge the validity of a law.
In the United States, primary legislation is, at the federal level, an Act of Congress. A statute that s authority or responsibility to an agency is called an "authorizing statute." A law created by the executive branch of the United States Government or that of a state government as the result of primary legislation is called a regulatory law.
Secondary (also called subordinate) legislation is all other forms of legislation that are not Acts of Parliament. It is very similar to administrative law in the United States. The legislative branch of governments often delegates power to allow ministers to make secondary legislation. Secondary legislation also includes s, s and decisions by s or s. Most Acts of Parliament in the UK contain s to allow secondary legislation. 
The two types of secondary legislation are delegated legislation and prerogative legislation.

Statute

A statute is a written law passed by a state or federal legislature that creates a rule or . Statutes (also called legal codes) provide the authority for other laws. Many state and federal agencies, such as the IRS, EPA and state Secretaries of State may issue regulations for the areas of the law they cover. A statute usually commands something, prohibits something or declares something to be policy. When there is a dispute over the meaning of a statute, a state or federal court may issue a judgment that s the statute more clearly. When this happens it also becomes case law.
Before a statute becomes law in some countries, it must be agreed upon by the highest executive in the government. Then it is published as part of a legal code. In many countries, statutes are organized (or codified) for a particular jurisdiction. In many nations statutory law is distinguished from and is to constitutional law.

Solange Pierre or Sonia Pierre, (1963 – December 4, 2011), was a human rights activist in the Dominican Republic. She worked to end "antihaitianismo", which is discrimination against people of Haitian origin either born in Haiti or in the Dominican Republic. For this work, she won the 2006 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award.
In 2010 she received the International Women of Courage Award from the United States Department of State.
Pierre was born in Villa Altagracia, San Cristóbal, Dominican Republic, in 1963. Her parents were from Haiti. Her mother came to the Dominican Republic in 1957 with a temporary work permit. Her father came to the Dominican territory illegally).
There were twelve children in Pierre's family The family lived in a migrant worker camp. The name of the camp is "batey". Many people from Haiti live here. Pierre's birth certificate said her name was Solain Pie. Pierre said that was a mistake by a government clerk."
On December 4, 2011, Pierre died at the age of 48. She had a heart attack on the way to the hospital in Villa Altagracia.
At the age of 14, Pierre started a protest by sugar cane workers. Pierre went to jail, but the protest received some attention. After the protest, the workers got better tools and more money. 
Pierre worked as director of the non-governmental organization Movement for Dominican Women of Haitian Descent (MUDHA). The goal of the group is to stop "antihaitianism", or discrimination against people from Haiti in the Dominican Republic.
In 2005, Pierre went to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in the case of two ethnic Haitian children who did not receive Dominican birth certificates. The name of the case was "Yean and Bosico v. Dominican Republic". The court told the Dominican government to give birth certificates to the children. However, later, the Dominican Supreme Court later said the Haitian workers were 'in transit,' so their children could not be citizens. "
For her work, Pierre received the 2006 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award from Senator Edward Kennedy. 
Pierre also received Amnesty International's 2003 Human Rights Ginetta Sagan Fund Award.

Principia Mathematica

The Principia Mathematica is a three-volume work on the foundations of mathematics by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell. It was published in 1910, 1912, and 1913. In 1927, it appeared in a second edition with an important "Introduction to the second edition", and different notes at the end. It is often known as "PM".
The book was an attempt to describe a set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic from which all mathematical truths could in principle be proved. This ambitious project is of great importance in the history of mathematics and philosophy. The authors believed that such a project could be done. However, in 1931, Gödel's incompleteness theorem proved that "PM", and any other attempt, could never reach this goal. For any set of axioms and inference rules proposed, either the system must be inconsistent, or there must in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them.
One of the main inspirations and motivations for "PM" was the earlier work of Gottlob Frege on logic.
"PM" is not to be confused with Russell's 1903 "Principles of Mathematics". "PM" states: "The present work was originally intended by us to be ... a second volume of Principles of Mathematics... But as we advanced, it became increasingly evident that the subject is a very much larger one than we had supposed..."
The Modern Library placed it 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century.

Court order

A court order (or order) is a formal written direction by a member of the judiciary. It directs a party to do something. It can also be an order not to do something, as in an injunction. 
An order can be as simple as setting a date for trial. They can also be involving many details. It may be a final order (one that concludes the court action), or an order (one during the action). Most orders are written, and are signed by the judge. Some orders, however, are spoken orally by the judge in open court, and are only reduced to writing in the transcript of the proceedings.
The following represents a small sampling of matters that are commonly dictated by the terms of a court order:

Party (law)

A party is a person or group of persons that make up a single for the purposes of the law. They are a participant in legal proceeding and have an interest in the outcome. Parties include: the plaintiff, the defendant, a petitioner or a respondent. They can also be a cross-complainant (a defendant who sues someone else in the same lawsuit) or a cross-defendant (a person sued by a cross-complainant). A person who only appears in the case as a witness is not considered a party.
Courts use various terms to identify the role of a particular party in civil litigation. They usually call the party that brings a lawsuit as the plaintiff, or, in older American cases, the "party of the first part". The party against whom the case was brought as the defendant, or, in older American cases, the "party of the second part".

Sir Augustine Danger "Austin" Powers, KBE, is a fictional character from the Austin Powers series of films. The character was created by Mike Myers. Mike Myers was also the actor who played the character in the films. He is the main character of ' (1997), ' (1999) and "Austin Powers in Goldmember" (2002). He is a British spy. He likes to go to parties and he represents the hippie culture of the 1960s. This is because he and his opponent Dr. Evil, were frozen during an experiment, and they stayed frozen for many years. The series' humor follows his attempts to adjust to the modern world as he continues to try to save it from terrorism.
Austin Powers was a character seen as a parody of James Bond. The character was also influenced by Harry Palmer and characters played by Peter Sellers.
The band Ming Tea was formed by Myers, Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs during the 1990s. The band acted like a British band of the 1960s. The band members all performed under pseudonyms (fake names) with 1960s personas. Myers adopted the pseudonym and character of Austin Powers. This group made a number of live club and television performances in character. Myers' wife at the time, Robin Ruzan, encouraged him to write a film based on Austin Powers.
Obituaries of Simon Dee (1935–2009), the radio and television presenter, claimed that the character of Austin Powers was inspired by Dee's "Sixties grooviness". Mike Myers has stated that the "Austin Powers" character was based on his own father.
Video Games: Austin Powers, Austin Powers Pinball, Austin Powers: Welcome to my Underground Lair, Austin Powers: Oh Behave!, and Austin Powers: Operation Trivia.

Sason

Sason ( "Sasun"; from ; formerly known as Sasun or Sassoun) is a district in the Batman Province of Turkey. It was formerly part of the sanjak of Siirt, which was in Diyarbakır vilayet until 1880. It was in Bitlis Vilayet in 1892. Later it became part of Muş sanjak in Bitlis vilayet. Sason remained part of Muş until 1927. It was one of the districts of Siirt province until 1993. The boundaries of the district varied considerably in time. The current borders are not the same as in the 19th century. This is when the district of Sasun was situated more to the north (mostly territory now included in the central district of Muş).
Sasun, as it is called by Armenians, holds a prominent role in Armenian culture and history. It is the setting of "Daredevils of Sassoun", Armenia's national epic. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was a major location of Armenian "fedayi" activities, who staged two uprisings against the Ottoman authorities. They rebelled against the Kurdish tribes in 1894 and 1904.
Historically the area was known as "Sasun", part of the historical Armenian Highland. Sasun was in the Arzanene province of the ancient Armenian Kingdom. Later the region was ruled by the Mamikonian dynasty from around 772 until 1189/1190. This is when the Mamikonians moved to Cilicia after being forced out by Shah-Armen.
The region was eventually conquered by the Ottoman Empire, becoming part of the sanjak of Muş in Bitlis Vilayet, and continued to hold a substantial population of Armenians. During this period, Sason was a federation of some forty Armenian villages, whose inhabitants were known as Sasuntsis (). Surrounded by fierce Kurdish tribes to whom they were often forced to pay tribute, the Sasuntsis were able to maintain an autonomy free of Turkish rule until the end of the 19th century when the Kurds themselves were finally brought under government control. Proud warriors, the Sasuntsis made all their own weapons and relied on nothing from the outside world.
In 1893, about three to four thousand nomadic Kurds from the Diyarbakır area entered the Sason region. This of nomads, who customarily used the mountain meadows of the area in summer for their herds, was harmful to the sedentary Armenians. The Kurds were responsible for bringing economic ruin to the agrarian community of the Armenian villagers. They would steal livestock and demand the Armenians to pay a second tax (that is, a separate tax in addition to the one Armenians paid to the Ottoman government). When Armenians decided to challenge the Kurds, there was a fight and a Kurd was killed. Using the Kurd's death as a reason, Turkish officials allowed a Kurdish attack against the Armenians of Sason.
The Kurds, however, were successfully driven off by the armed Armenian villagers. But that success was then seen as a possible threat by the Ottoman authorities. In 1894 the villagers refused to pay taxes unless the Ottoman authorities protected them against more Kurdish attacks and extortions. Instead, the government sent a force of about 3,000 soldiers and Kurdish irregulars to disarm the villagers. This ended in a general massacre of between 900 to 3,000 men, women and children. The "Sasun affair" was d by European Powers. This resulted in demands that Ottoman Turkey initiate reforms in the six "Armenian vilayets". Abdul Hamid II's response to those demands culminated in the anti-Armenian pogroms of 1895 and 1896.
As part of the Hamidian massacres, it is estimated that at least 1,000 Armenian villagers were slain in the Sason atrocity. This was caused by the buildup of Ottoman troops in early 1894. Officials and military officers involved in the Sason massacres were decorated and rewarded.
Today, most of Sason's population is Kurd, Arab, or Zaza. An Armenian minority may still exist (in 1972 there were estimated to be some 6,000 Armenian villagers in the region).

Administrative law

Administrative law (also called regulatory law) covers a wide range of procedures by administrative agencies. These agencies include city, county, state or government bodies. They may be called s, s, divisions or boards. 
Each may have its own rules and regulations which are usually not found in statutes. These are based on laws passed by a government. Agencies also have the power to enforce these rules and regulations.
Congress or state legislatures pass laws, sometimes on complicated issues. The details of how these laws are to be enforced is left to administrative agencies. For example, a government agency, the Social Security Administration (SSA) was created August 14, 1935 by an act of Congress. They were given the authority to administer Social Security benefits and disability laws. They have passed a body of rules and regulations that determine how benefits will be handled.
The rules created by the European Union are carried out by an "ad hoc" collection of agencies. These rules may be for a particular treaty or for things such as trade policy. These agencies on a policy-by-policy basis.

Battery (crime)

Battery is the intentional and offensive or harmful contact with another person. The exact definition varies by jurisdiction. In criminal law the elements of battery are physical contact that causes harm or offensive contact without that person's consent. Battery is often confused with assault which is threatening battery. Battery is when the threat (assault) is carried out and the person is harmed in some way. Criminal battery and civil battery may be the same or differ slightly depending on jurisdiction. In many cases the act of battery can result in both criminal and civil .
Civil battery is a tort. It is a wrong committed against another person that results in damage. It is also called an intentional tort. In most cases they are the result of negligence, caused by or recklessness. The person on whom the battery was committed, the victim, may bring a lawsuit in court to collect monetary damages. 
Criminal battery is the result of breaking a law regarding harming another person. Criminal cases are prosecuted by the state. There are four elements to criminal battery:
If all four elements can be proved, a "prima facie" case exists to go ahead and prosecute the offender.
In most cases the civil lawsuit follows a criminal trial. A person found not-guilty in a criminal trial does not prevent the victim from filing a civil suit. The burden of proof is usually lower in a civil court than in a criminal court.
When a court refers to 'battery', what is usually meant is simple battery. Simple battery is more often a misdemeanor. The elements of simple battery include:
Aggravated battery is more serious than simple battery. In most jurisdictions aggravated battery is a felony. What defines aggravated battery can vary, but most often in includes:

Neurosecretion

Neurosecretion is when nerve cells make, store and release hormones. 
The hormonal system of the body is almost entirely controlled by the central nervous system. It normally does this by sending nerve impulses down axons to a gland. However, some special nerve cells can make hormones themselves, and deliver them to glands which act as storage organs. The neurons of the neuroendocrine system are large; they are mini factories for producing secretory products. These cells are called neurosecretory cells, and they make neurohormones.
Most neurohormones are secreted from nerve cells in the hypothalamus of the brain which (either immediately, or after storage) circulate in the blood. They are similar to normal endocrine cells and glands because they regulate both endocrine and nonendocrine cells. 
There are also neuroendocrine cells in the adrenal glands, which are just above the kidneys. They are called chromaffin cells, and they release epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline).

Ironclad warship

An ironclad is a ship protected by iron or steel armor plates. The first recorded use of an ironclad was during the Japanese invasion of Korea. Western use of ironclads began about the second half of the 19th century. The Western ironclad was developed because up to then wooden warships were easily damaged by explosive or incendiary shells.
In 1592 Admiral Yi-Sun put armor plates on his "tortoise-ships". These protected the sides and top from bullets, arrows and fire. This allowed his small fleet to be victorious in several battles with the ese fleet. The first Western ironclad battleship, "Gloire", was launched by the French Navy in November 1859. The British Admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856. They prepared a draft design for an armored corvette in 1857. In early 1859 the Royal Navy started building two iron-hulled armored frigates, and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all-armored battle fleet. After the first clashes of ironclads (both with wooden ships and with one another) took place in 1862 during the American Civil War. It became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat. This type of ship would come to be very successful in the American Civil War.
By the 1870s, ironclads were the main warships of the world's most powerful Navies. But the ironclad era only lasted about 50 years. By the 1890s most sailing ironclads had been replaced by modern battleships.

Nuremberg principles

The Nuremberg principles were a set of s for determining what constitutes a war crime. The document was created by the International Law Commission of the United Nations to codify the legal principles underlying the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi party members following World War II.
"Any person who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefor and to punishment."
"The fact that internal law does not impose a penalty for an act which constitutes a crime under international law does not relieve the person who committed the act from responsibility under international law."
"The fact that a person who committed an act which constitutes a crime under international law acted as Head of State or responsible government official does not relieve him from responsibility under international law."
"The fact that a person acted pursuant to (an) order of his government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him".
Before the time of the Nuremberg Trials, this defense was called "Superior Orders". After the Nuremberg Trials, that defense is now referred to by many as the "Nuremberg Defense". More recently a third term, "lawful orders", has been used for the same defense. 
"Any person charged with a crime under international law has the right to a fair trial on the facts and law."
"The crimes hereinafter set out are punishable as crimes under international law: 
"Complicity in the commission of a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity as set forth in Principle VI is a crime under international law."

Codification (law)

In law, codification is the process of collecting and restating the law of a jurisdiction. They are listed, usually by subject, forming a legal code (a codex or book of law). Codification is the defining feature of civil law jurisdictions.
Ancient Sumer's Code of Ur-Nammu was compiled 2100-2050 BC. It is the earliest known surviving civil code. Three centuries later, the Babylonian king Hammurabi enacted the set of laws named after him.
Religious laws such as the Torah were codified. Important codifications were developed in the ancient Roman Empire, with the compilations of the Lex Duodecim Tabularum. Much later the Corpus Iuris Civilis was assembled. These codified laws were the exceptions rather than the rule. During much of ancient history the Roman laws were left mostly uncodified.
The first "permanent" system of codified laws could be found in China. This was with the compilation of the "Tang Code" in AD 624. This formed the basis of the Chinese criminal code. This was then replaced by the "Great Qing Legal Code". This code was in turn abolished in 1912 following the Xinhai Revolution and the establishment of the Republic of China. The new laws of the Republic of China were inspired by the German codified work, the "Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch". A very influential example in Europe was the French Napoleonic code of 1804.
Another early system of laws is Hindu law framed by Manu and called as Manu Smriti. They date back to the 2nd century BC. The use of civil codes in Islamic Sharia law began with the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century AD.

Cosmological principle

In modern physical cosmology, the cosmological principle is a prediction based on the idea that the universe is about the same in all places when viewed on a large scale.
Forces are expected to act uniformly throughout the universe. There should, therefore, be no observable irregularities in the large scale structure The structure is the result of the evolution of the matter field after the Big Bang.
Astronomer William Keel explains:
The cosmological principle is usually stated formally as 'Viewed on a sufficiently large scale, the properties of the universe are the same for all observers.' This amounts to the strongly philosophical statement that the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample, and that the same physical laws apply throughout.
The two testable consequences of the cosmological principle are homogeneity and isotropy. Homogeneity means that the same observational evidence is available to observers at different locations in the universe ("the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample"). Isotropy means that the same observational evidence is available by looking in any direction in the universe ("the same physical laws apply throughout"). The principles are closely related, because a universe that appears isotropic from any two (for a spherical geometry, three) locations must also be homogeneous.

Walter Tull

Walter Daniel John Tull (28 April 1888 – 25 March 1918) was an English professional footballer. He played as an inside forward for Tottenham Hotspur and Northampton Town. He was the second person of mixed race to play in the top division of the Football League. He was the first mixed-race British outfielder in the top division of English football. His professional football career began after he was spotted while playing for his local amateur club, Clapton F.C.. He began playing for Clapton in 1908. Within a few months he had won winners' medals in the FA Amateur Cup, London County Amateur Cup and London Senior Cup. In March 1909 the "Football Star" called him "the catch of the season".
Tull was brought up in a National Children's Home orphanage in Bethnal Green, London, along with his brother. They were placed there following the death of their parents. He joined Tottenham in 1909 and transferred to Northampton Town in 1911, where he made 111 first-team appearances.
During the First World War, Tull served in the Footballers' Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment. He fought in the Battle of the Somme in 1916. Tull was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant on 30 May 1917. This was in spite of the fact there was a ban on black people being given that status.
Tull fought in Italy in 1917–18. He was noted for his "gallantry and coolness" while leading his company of 26 men on a raiding party into enemy territory. He returned to France in 1918. Tull was killed in action on 25 March during the Spring Offensive. His body was never recovered.
Campaigners have called for a statue to be erected in his honour. Northampton South MP Brian Binley has campaigned for Tull to be posthumously awarded the Military Cross. He was honoured with a commemorative plaque in London placed close to where he lived. A Walter Tull commemorative coin is part of a set of £5 coins released by the Royal Mint.

<doc id="522803" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=522803" title="Trust law">
Trust law

In law a trust is a relationship where property is held by one party for the benefit of another party. A trust is created by the owner, also called a "settlor", "trustor" or "grantor" who transfers property to a trustee. The trustee holds that property for the trust's beneficiaries. Trusts exist mainly in common law jurisdictions. They have existed since Roman times.
When an owner of property places that property into trust, he or she turns over part or all of his or her rights to the trustee. This separates the property's legal ownership and control from its settlor's ownership and benefits. This controls the property and its benefits if the settlor is absent, incapacitated, or dead. Trusts are frequently created in wills, defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries.
The trustee is given legal title to the trust property, but has an obligation to act for the good of the beneficiaries. The benefits of the trust belong to the beneficiary. The trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed. But the trustee must otherwise must turn over all profits from the trust properties. Trustees who don't do this are self-dealing. Courts can reverse self dealing actions, order profits returned, and impose other sanctions.
The trustee may be either a individual, a company, or a public body. There may be a single trustee or multiple co-trustees. The trust is governed by the terms under which it was created. In most jurisdictions, this requires a contractual trust agreement or deed.
Testamentary trusts transfer property into the trust after the death of the settlor. The trust allows the settlor to specify any conditions and may spread payments from the trust over a period of time. Testamentary trusts are not automatically created when the settlor dies but may be specified in will. Because it is a provision of a will it must go through probate.
A living trust is more complicated than a testamentary trust. Many people use a living trust to avoid probate, which it does. But you cannot use living trusts to name guardians or executors (executrix for a female executor) for your children. Either requires a will.
A living trust provides property management both during the settlor's lifetime and after death. Living trusts may be used to manage property. If the owner is incapacated, disabled by an accident or illness, or is unavailable to manage the property the trustee can manage the property.
Advantages of a living trust include:

Hohmann transfer orbit

In orbital mechanics, a Hohmann transfer orbit moves a spacecraft between orbiting heights. It is the most fuel-efficient method to do so, because the spacecraft is not trying to escape the planet's gravity, using an elliptical orbit for the transfer. 
A ship using this would have to apply two velocities, one to enter the elliptical orbit, and one to enter the second orbit. 
Assuming the mass of the spacecraft is much lower than that of the orbiting planet, the two velocities, formula_1 and formula_2, can be solved for as:formula_3formula_4where

Kostandin Shpataraku

Kostandin Shpataraku (flourished 1736–67) was an Albanian painter of 18th century. 
Kostandin Shpataraku was born in Valesh village in the Shpat region of Albania. The region is located in the southern highland of Elbasan, Albania, in today's Gjinar which was originally in the Ottoman Empire.
Shpataraku was a painter in the Orthodox tradition of icons and Byzantine church frescoes, active between 1736 and 1767. His works combine Byzantine tradition and Italian Renaissance influences.
Shpataraku was beheaded by the Ottomans in Elbasan. His family took his body and buried him in his village with his head apart from the rest of the body, so the Ottomans could not find his exact grave. A small chapel was built later to commemorate him. He is also commemorated as a saint by the locals, on September 21.
Many of his icons are in Ardenica Monastery, St. Jovan Vladimir's Church near Elbasan, Vithkuq, and in the "Museum of Medieval Art" in Korce. Many of his works belong to private collections.

Elastin

Elastin is part of connective tissue. It is an elastic protein which allows many tissues in the body to go back to their shape after stretching or contracting. Elastin helps skin return to its original position when handled. Elastin is also used in places where mechanical energy is stored. 
Elastin is important in blood vessels because it helps blood to flow. It is common in large elastic blood vessels such as the aorta. Elastin is also very important in the lungs, ligaments, the skin, the bladder, and elastic cartilage. It is present in all vertebrates above the jawless fish.
In humans, elastin is encoded by the "ELN" gene.

Icterid

The Icteridae are a family of small to medium-sized New World songbirds. They are usually brightly colored. Most species have black as a main plumage color, often enlivened by yellow, orange or red. The family is extremely varied in size, shape, behavior and coloration. 
This group includes the New World blackbirds, New World orioles, the bobolink, meadowlarks, grackles, cowbirds, oropendolas and caciques. Despite their similar names, they are only distantly related to the Old World common blackbird (which is a thrush) or the Old World orioles.
Icterids are unusual in songbirds because they have considerable sexual dimorphism. For example, the male great-tailed grackle is 60% heavier than the female. The smallest icterid species is the orchard oriole, in which the female averages 15 cm in length (6 in) and in weight, while the largest is the Amazonian oropendola, the male of which measures and weighs about . This variation in size is greater than usual in passerine families. 
One unusual adaptation shared by the icterids is gaping, where the skull allows them to open their bills strongly rather than passively. This lets them force open gaps to get at hidden food.

Mýa sometimes was bullied because of her ethnic background. She would say 
There was a time in my life when I wasn't popular and accepted by kids in school. I was made fun of with braces and kinky hair, and being from a multicultural family, etcetera... And it really hurts when you're that age, but later when you get something of your own or you get involved in activities like a sport, you begin to be accepted for what you do, and your personality and who you are, instead of your clothes and how you look and the name designer brands you have on.

Chain mail

Mail, or chain mail, is a type of armour. It is made of small metal rings linked together in a pattern to form a mesh. The Celts are usually credited with inventing mail armour. Celtic mail was usually made in the form of a vest.
The origins of the word "mail" are not fully known. One theory is that it originally comes from the Latin word "macula", meaning "spot" or "opacity". Another theory relates the word to the Old French "maillier", meaning “to hammer” (related to the modern English word "malleable"). A mail shirt is a called a hauberk (haubergeon or byrnie). Mail leggings were called chausses. A mail Hood is called a coif and covered the head, neck and shoulders. 
Many scholars think mail was invented by ancient Celts about the 3rd century BC. At that time their iron work was probably the best in Europe. The Romans quickly adopted it for their own army. A shirt of mail armour weighed about . After a battle it was common practice to strip weapons and armour from the dead. Vikings were known to wear mail armor whenever they could get their hands on it. Mail was expensive, time consuming to make, and required a supply of iron. It became more expensive as improvements were made in materials and workmanship. Mail armour was in use in Europe until the 15th century.
Mail is today used in gloves to prevent cuts by butchers and firefighters. Some divers wear mail suits when swimming around sharks and particularly when feeding sharks. But mail is heavy and it makes moving around more difficult. Mail is very popular by history reenactors. It is also popular in live action role playing.

Afar Triangle

The Afar Triangle (or Afar Depression) is a low area bordering on the Red Sea. It is part of the Great Rift Valley in East Africa. 
The area overlaps the borders of Eritrea, Djibouti and the entire Afar region of Ethiopia. 
Important fossil specimens of the earliest hominins have been found in this area. These are the earliest of the human clade. The area is thought by some paleontologists to be the cradle of the evolution of humans. 
Many important fossil localities exist in the Afar region. These sites have produced specimens of the earliest (fossil) hominins and of human tool culture, as well as many fossils of flora and fauna.
The Triangle includes the lowest point in Africa, Lake Asal, Djibouti, at 155 m (or 509 ft) below sea level.
The Awash River is the main waterflow into the region. It runs dry during the annual dry season, and ends as a chain of saline lakes. The northern part of the Afar Depression is also known as the Danakil Depression. The lowlands are affected by heat, drought, and poor air circulation. Some of the lowlands are the hottest places (year-round average temperatures) of anywhere on Earth.
The Afar Triangle is bordered by high areas, as shown on the topographic map.
The Depression is a plate tectonic triple junction. This geologic feature is one of earth's great active volcanic areas, so the floor of the depression is composed of lava, mostly basalt.
The continuous process of volcanism makes mineral deposits, like sulfur, salt, bentonite, and gypsum. There are also geothermal energy sources and hot springs in different areas of the region.
In 2005, a giant rift was formed in just a few days. The rift opened when the Dabbahu Volcano erupted. The rift is part of the process of the Arabian and African plates moving apart. This new crack, long, and deep, opened when the lava from the erupting volcano flowed underground and cooled. It left a long, wide dike within days.

Stabat mater

Stabat Mater Dolorosa, often referred to as Stabat Mater, is a 13th-century Catholic hymn to Mary. It has been attributed to the Franciscan Jacopone da Todi and to Innocent III. It is about the Sorrows of Mary.
Like so many other hymns the name of the hymn is made of the first few words. This is called an incipit. The first line reads "Stabat mater dolorosa" ("The sorrowful mother stood"). The "Stabat Mater" hymn is about the suffering of Mary, Jesus Christ's mother, during his crucifixion. It is sung at the liturgy on the memorial of Our Lady of Sorrows. The "Stabat Mater" has been set to music by many composers, among them Palestrina, Pergolesi, Alessandro Scarlatti and Domenico Scarlatti, Vivaldi, Haydn, Rossini, Dvořák, George Henschel, Karol Szymanowski, Poulenc and Arvo Pärt.
In the 16th centry, the hymn was added to the Roman missal. The Council of Trent banned it, like most sequences. In the 18th century it was added to the Breviary of Roman Catholic mass. The Second Vactican Council abolished this form of mass, so it is only part of regular mass one day of the year. The current version can be found in the Roman Gradual, which dates of 1973.

Wayanad

Wayanad district began on 1st November, 1980 as the 12th District of Kerala consisting of Mananthavady, Sulthanbathery and Vythiri Taluks. The name Wayanad is derived from Vayal Nadu which means the land of paddy fields. It is a picturesque plateau situated at a height between 700 meters and 2100 meters above the mean sea level nested among the mountains of the Western Ghats on the Eastern portion of North Kerala and on the sides of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka States. The District was carved out from the then Kozhikode and Kannur Districts. About 885.92.sq.km of area is under forest. The culture of Wayanad is mainly tribal oriented. Though considered as backward, this District is perhaps one of the biggest foreign exchange earners of the State, with its production of cash crops like pepper,cardamom, coffee, tea, spices and other condiments.
In ancient times the land was ruled by the Vedar Rajas. Later Wayanad came under the rule of Pazhassi Raja of Kottayam Royal Dynasty. The modern history of the district is associated with the events that took place during the Mysorean invasion and the long spell of the British rule stretching over a period of about two centuries. There was fierce encounter between the British and Pazhassi Rajah. When the state of Kerala came into being in 1956, Wayanad was a part of Cannannore district; later in 1957 south Wayanad was added to Kozhikode district and north Wayanad remained with Cannannore district. By amalgamating the north Wayanad and south Wayanad, the present Wayanad district came into being on the 1st November 1980 comprising of three taluks; Vythiry, Mananthavady and Sulthan Bathery.
One important characteristic feature of this district is the large adivasi population, consisting mainly of Paniyas, Kurumas, Adiyars, Kurichyas, Ooralis, Kadans,Kattunaikkans are the different aboriginal tribes of Wayanad. The Kurichyar is the most developed among them. They are small land owners, whereas the members of other tribes are mostly labourers. Wayanad district stands first in the case of adivasi population (about 36%) among other districts in the state. 
Wayanad has a large settler population. There are people from almost all parts of Kerala who migrated to this fertile land for building up their lives. Wayanad has a small jain community consisting of Gowders who came from Karnataka. They have built beautiful temples all over the district. Almost all sections of Christianity are well represented. One fourth population of Wayanad is constituted by Christians. Muslims constitute another one fourth population and rest of the population belongs to Hindus. Their hard work and sacrifice helped them to prosper. On the other hand, the last few decades have seen the complete marginalisation of the indigeneous people.

Universal Children's Day is an annual celebration of children's rights. It is celebrated on the 20th of November each year.
On the 14th of December 1954, the United Nations General Assembly recommended that countries celebrate a Universal Children's Day. The date 20 November marks the day on which the assembly adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. On 20 November 1959 they adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
According to UNICEF millions of children in the world are victims of violence every year. In addition to violence, these children are subject to abuse, neglect and exploitation. This is at home, at work, at school and in the community. It also takes place during wars and natural disasters.

Smoke detector

A Smoke sensor or Smoke detector is a device that can detect smoke, which may be an indicator of a fire. There are two basic systems: Simple, standalone sensors usually make a sound or flash a light when they detect smoke. More sophisticated sensors usually send a signal to an fire alarm panel, or system. Most smoke detectors use either an optical sensor, or they use a physical process called ionization. Many simple smoke sensors use batteries. Very often dead batteries are not replaced; when this happens, the smoke sensors stop working. But, the detector may "chirp" when the battery is low to try and stop this from happening. There are also systems which are directly connected to electrical power; these may use batteries just as a backup.

United States presidential election, 1944

The United States presidential election of 1944 was held on Tuesday, November 7, 1944. Incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) won over Republican Thomas E. Dewey in the general election. In the Electoral College, Roosevelt won 432 votes while Dewey won 99. Roosevelt, a Democrat, won an unprecedented fourth term as President.
The election was held during the latter part of World War II. By this time the war was going well for the United States and its Allies. Roosevelt had already served longer than any other president, but remained popular. Unlike in 1940, there was little doubt that he would run for another term as the Democratic candidate. Dewey, the Governor of New York, campaigned against the New Deal and for a smaller government. But he could not convince the country to change course. Roosevelt's aides covered up the fact the president was in poor health. Roosevelt would die in office three months after starting his fourth term. His Vice President, Harry S. Truman, would serve out the remainder of his term of office.
The Republicans campaigned against the New Deal. They wanted a smaller government and less-regulated economy. Roosevelt's continuing popularity was the main theme of his campaign. To quiet rumors of his poor health, Roosevelt insisted on making a vigorous campaign trip in October and rode in an open car through city streets. A high point of the campaign occurred when Roosevelt gave a speech on national radio where he ridiculed Republican claims that his administration was corrupt and wasteful with tax money. He particularly ridiculed a Republican claim that he had sent a US Navy warship to pick up his Scottish Terrier Fala in Alaska. He added that "Fala was furious" at such rumors. The speech was met with loud laughter and applause. In response, Dewey gave a blistering partisan speech in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, a few days later on national radio. He accused Roosevelt of being "indispensable" to corrupt big-city Democratic organizations and American Communists. Dewey also referred to members of Roosevelt's cabinet as a "motley crew". However, the allies had several battlefield successes in Europe and the Pacific during the campaign. These included the liberation of Paris in August 1944 and the successful Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines in October 1944. These were Roosevelt's greatest assets in his campaign.
The 1944 presidential election was a milestone in American politics for two reasons. It was the first time a candidate for president was born in the 20th century. It was the last time Democrats carried every state in the southern United States. The election had at least one other long-reaching effect. It led to the 1951 passing of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution. It prohibits anyone from serving more than two terms as president of the United States.

Junagadh State

Junagadh was a princely state in Gujarat ruled by Muslim rulers in British India until its integration into India in 1948.
Mohammad Sher Khan Babi, a Babi Khel Pathan who owed allegiance to the Mughal governor of Gujarat subah, founded the state of Junagadh. It declared independence in 1730 after the Marathas Gaikwad invasion. Muhammad Sher Khan Babi, was the founder of the Babi Dynasty of Junagadh State dynasty. His descendants, the Babi Nawabs of Junagadh, took large territories in southern Saurashtra and ruled over the state for the next two centuries. First they were a tributary state of Marathas. Later they were under the rule of the British Raj.
In 1807 the Junagadh State became a British protectorate. The East India Company took control of the state by 1818. The Saurashtra area, with other princely states of Kathiawar, were separately administered under Kathiawar Agency by British India.
On 15 August 1947 upon the independence of India, the Nawab of Junagarh decided to merge it into newly formed Pakistan. The Indian government maintained the people of Junagadh should decide. Pakistan waited until 13 September to respond saying they accepted Junagarh's acceptance of Pakistani rule. This caused a general revolt among the Hindu majority of Junagadh as well as protest movements in the surrounding states that had acceded to join India. The Nawab then occupied territory in several of those states claiming he had rule over them. When the Indian government sent a small force to restore order, the Nawab fled to Pakistan. His Dewan (Prime minister) agreed to rule by India. This resulted in the integration of Junagadh into India.
The Nawabs of Junagadh belonged to Pathan Babi khel tribe. They were granted a 13 gun salute by the British authorities:
Many in Pakistan still maintains the 1948 plebiscite and rule by India was an illegitimate action. One of the reasons is because Kashmir at the time was ruled by a Hindu but had a clear Muslim majority. By acceding to India it was the opposite of the situation in Junagadh.
For its part India knew Junagadh was the premier state in the western Kathiawar region. It was bound on three sides by states that acceded to India. On the fourth side was bounded by the Arabian Sea. This gave it great strategic importance to both countries. India was not prepared to accept Junagadh's acceding to Pakistan. This would create a Pakistan state in the middle of Indian states. India's taking administrative control of Junagadh to restore order is seen as a pretext by Pakistan. The referendum taken by the people of Junagadh, under the control of the Indian army, was overwhelmingly in favor of Indian rule. Pakistan has never accepted this vote by the people there and believes Junagadh rightly belongs to them.

Nordertor

The Nordertor (Danish: "Nørreport") is an old town gate of the city of Flensburg. The gate was built around 1595. Today, the little Landmark is in use as a symbol for the German town Flensburg.
In 1345 the town of Flensburg began to build its town wall. A gate was built on the north side of the town. It was called "Norder Porte". It was replaced by a building in the 16th century called the Nordertor. This marked the northern boundary of the town. It was a checkpoint that was closed in the night.
On the north side of the gate are two plaques. The left one shows the royal coat of arms of King Christian IV, 1577-1648 and the Latin words: „Regna Firmat Pietas“ — Piety strengthens the Realms. The right one shows the coat of arms of Flensburg with the German words: „Friede ernährt, Unfrieden verzehrt“ — Peace nurtures, strife devours. There is also a date- 1767. This means that the town gate was restored in the time of Christian VII, 1749-1808.
After 1796 the town grew beyond the town wall. There had been a ban on building outside the wall before then. The Neustadt ("Newtown"), in the neighborhood of the Nordertor was built. In 1913 and 1914 it was restored by the architect Paul Ziegler. The Nordertor got a clock. In 1966 the Deutsche Bundespost made a stamp with a picture of the gate on it. It was a 30 Pfennig stamp, used to send letters within Germany. The Nordertor stamps were sold over 3 billion times. In the 1990s the gate was again restored and the clock was removed. In 2004 the gate was licensed as a venue for civil weddings, so that the weddings could be performed since then directly above the archway of the gate.

Ship's cat

A ship's cat is a cat that rides along on trading, exploration, and naval ships. Ship's cats have been very popular in history, and date back to ancient times. 
Cats have been carried on ships for many reasons - most importantly, to catch mice and rats. On a ship, these rodents can cause damage to ropes and wooden parts of the ship. Once electricity was discovered, rodents would also damage ships' electrical wiring. Also, rodents threatened the ship's cargo - the things it carried. Rodents would eat the food carried to feed the crew. If the ship was carrying things like grain as part of its cargo, rodents could also cause the ship to lose money by eating the cargo. Also, rats and mice spread disease, which is dangerous for ships that are at sea for long periods of time. For example, rat fleas can carry plague, and rats on ships may have been one of the main reasons why the Black Death spread.
Cats naturally attack and kill these rodents. Cats also have a natural ability to get used to new surroundings, so they could get used to serving on ships. They also offered companionship (friendship), a sense of home and security, and lifted sailors' spirits. This was helpful to sailors who could be away from home for long periods, especially in times of war.
Cats were probably domesticated about 9,500 years ago. Not long after that, people began taking cats aboard boats and ships. The Ancient Egyptians took cats on board Nile boats to catch birds in the thickets along the riverbanks. The ancient Egyptians also carried cats on trading ships to control rodents. Traders from other areas soon started doing the same thing. This led to the spread of cats throughout the world. Cats eventually reached nearly all parts of the world that could be reached by ship. Phoenician cargo ships are thought to have brought the first domesticated cats to Europe in about 900 BC.
Cats in Ancient Egypt were worshipped as deities (powerful spirits).. For many centuries, cats have had a reputation as magical animals. Many sailors believed myths and superstitions about cats. Cats were thought of as smart, lucky animals. Sailors usually took very good care of their ship's cats to keep them happy. Some sailors believed that six-toed cats were better at catching pests. They may have thought that extra toes give a cat better balance, which would be important when at sea. In some places, all six-toed cats became known as "ship's cats".
Cats were believed to have miraculous powers that could protect ships from dangerous weather. Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too. They believed that these cats would use their special powers to protect their husbands at sea. Many sailors believed that it was lucky if a cat came up to a sailor on deck, but unlucky if it came only halfway and then turned around. Another popular belief was that cats could start storms through magic stored in their tails. Other sailors also believed that if a ship's cat fell or was thrown overboard, a terrible storm would come and sink the ship, and if the ship was able to survive, it would be cursed with nine years of bad luck. Still other sailors thought that if a cat licked its fur against the grain, it meant a hail storm was coming; if it sneezed, rain was coming; and if it was frisky, wind was coming.
Some of these beliefs are partly true. Cats can notice slight changes in the weather, because of their very sensitive inner ears. (Their inner ears also allow cats to land on their feet when falling.) Cats often get nervous and restless when they sense low atmospheric pressure, which often comes before stormy weather.
Blackie was HMS "Prince of Wales"'s ship's cat. He became famous during the Second World War. Blackie's ship, "Prince of Wales", carried Prime Minister Winston Churchill across the Atlantic Ocean to Naval Station Argentia in Newfoundland in August 1941. There, Churchill secretly met with the United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the two signed the Atlantic Charter. But as Churchill started to leave "Prince of Wales", Blackie came up to him. Churchill bent down to say goodbye to Blackie, and the moment was photographed and reported in the world media. (See the picture at the top of this page.) In honour of the success of the visit, Blackie was renamed Churchill. Blackie survived the sinking of HMS "Prince of Wales" later that year and was taken to Singapore with the survivors. He could not be found when Singapore was evacuated the following year and nobody knows what happened to him (though there is a chance he may have died by then).
Chibbley was the ship's cat aboard the tall ship "Picton Castle". She was rescued from an animal shelter. She circumnavigated the world - sailed all the way around it - five times. Because "Picton Castle"’ was a training ship, Chibbley many visitors. She became a celebrity, and people even sent her fan mail. Chibbley died on November 10, 2011, in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. She had sailed over 180,000 miles at sea.
Convoy was the ship's cat aboard HMS "Hermione". He was named "Convoy" because he often went with the ship on convoy escort duties (where the ship would sail with a group of other ships for protection). Like the ship's sailors, Convoy was listed in the ship's book, and given a full kit, including a tiny hammock where he would sleep. He was killed along with 87 of his crew mates when "Hermione" was torpedoed and sunk on 16 June 1942 by German submarine U-205.
Emmy was the ship's cat on RMS "Empress of Ireland". She was an orange tabby cat who never missed a voyage. However, on 28 May 1914, Emmy tried to escape the ship. The crew could not get her to return to the ship, and "Empress of Ireland" left without her. This was thought to be a very bad sign. Early the next morning, "Empress of Ireland" ran into SS "Storstad" while sailing through fog at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. "Empress of Ireland" sank quickly, killing over 1,000 people.
Felix was the ship's cat aboard "Mayflower II" when she set sail from Devon, England, to Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1957. The goal of this voyage was to show cooperation between the UK and the US after World War II. Felix was given his own life jacket for the trip. During the voyage, he broke one of his paws. The paw was set by the ship's doctor. After Felix returned to the US, photos and stories about him appeared in "National Geographic" magazine, "Life" magazine, and "Yankee" magazine. The cat and the rest of the crew marched in a New York ticker tape parade and toured the East Coast that summer. Felix was eventually adopted by the cabin boy's girlfriend, Ann Berry, and settled in Waltham, Massachusetts. The captain of the Mayflower II wrote a children's book about Felix called "Felix and his Mayflower II Adventures". The book was published during the celebration of the ship's fiftieth anniversary at Plimoth Plantation.
Mrs. Chippy was the ship's cat aboard "Endurance", the ship used by Sir Ernest Shackleton for his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. (The Expedition's goal was to cross the Antarctic by land.) After about a month, the crew realized that "Mrs. Chippy" was actually a male cat. However, by then, everyone was used to the name "Mrs. Chippy," and kept using it.
The ship became lost, trapped and then crushed in pack ice. At that point, Shackleton ordered his men to shoot the sled dogs and Mrs. Chippy, because he did not think they could survive.
Simon was the ship's cat of HMS "Amethyst" during the Yangtze Incident in 1949, during the Chinese Civil War. During the Yangtze Incident, the HMS "Amethyst" was attacked and was trapped on the Yangtze River for months. The ship and its crew were badly hurt in the attacks on the ship. These attacks killed 25 of "Amethyst"’s crew, including the commanding officer. Simon was also hurt in the attacks, but soon he recovered. He started killing rats again, which was very important since the rodents had been destroying the ship. Simon also did the important job of keeping up the crew's spirits. 
After the "Amethyst" finally escaped the Yangtze River and returned to Britain, Simon was given the rank of 'Able Seacat' Simon. He became a celebrity. However, not long after he returned to Britain, he died from an infection. Many people sent tributes to honor Simon, and his obituary appeared in "The Times" (an important newspaper in London). After Simon's death, he was awarded the Dickin Medal. He is the only cat ever to earn this award. Simon was also buried with full naval honors.
Trim sailed on many ships commanded by Matthew Flinders during 1801-1803. These ships' goals were to circumnavigate (sail all the way around) Australia, and also to create maps of its coastline. Trim became a favourite of the crew, and was the first cat to circumnavigate Australia. Trim stayed with Flinders until Trim's death. A statue to Trim was later built in his honor. It sits on a window sill on the outside of the State Library, in Sydney, Australia. There have also been many books written about Trim. 
U-boat was another ship's cat aboard a Royal Navy ship in the Second World War. Whenever his ship came into port, U-boat would take shore leave (he would leave the ship to do things on shore). He would spend days on shore, and usually would return only just before his ship sailed away. One day, U-boat did not return in time for roll call and his ship was forced to sail away without him. As the ship pulled away, U-boat was seen running down the dock after the sailing ship. He made a death-defying leap onto the ship and made it aboard. The crew thought that he seemed unafraid by what had just happened, and calmly started to wash himself on deck. The crew members were very happy that U-boat had come back, since they thought he brought them good luck.
Oscar was the ship's cat of the German battleship "Bismarck". When "Bismarck" was sunk on 27 May 1941, only 116 sailors out of over 2,200 survived. Oscar was picked up by the destroyer HMS "Cossack". "Cossack" herself was torpedoed and sunk on 24 October, 1941. 159 sailors were killed, but Oscar again survived to be rescued, and was taken to Gibraltar. He became the ship's cat of HMS "Ark Royal". Then this ship, too, was torpedoed and sunk in November of 1941. Oscar was again rescued, and it was decided that it was time for him to have a home on land. By now, Oscar had been renamed "Unsinkable Sam." He was given a new job as mouse-catcher in the Governor General of Gibraltar's office buildings. He eventually returned to the UK and spent the rest of his life at the 'Home for Sailors'. A portrait of him hangs in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.
Starting in 1975, the Royal Navy no longer allowed cats or any other pets to ride on any Royal Navy ships. This rule was created because of concern about hygiene (cleanliness).
Cats still ride on many private ships today. For example, "Toolbox" is a ship's cat who rides on the second "Kalmar Nyckel".
American sailor Robin Lee Graham sailed with many cats on his ships "Dove" and "Return of Dove", while he was trying to circumnavigate the world by himself (starting in 1965).

Calendula officinalis

Calendula officinalis (pot marigold, ruddles, common marigold, garden marigold), is a plant in the genus "Calendula" of the family Asteraceae. It is probably native to India. It was the state flower of Junagadh and Bantva-Manavadar State, now part of Gujarat.
Pot marigold florets are edible. They are often used to add colour to salads or added to dishes as a garnish instead of saffron. 
The leaves are edible but are often not palatable. They have been used as a herb and in salads. 
The flowers were used in Ancient Greek, Roman, Middle Eastern, and Indian cultures as a medicinal herb and a dye for fabrics, foods, and cosmetics. They are also used to make oil that protects the skin.

Nymphaea nouchali

Nymphaea nouchali, (or red and blue water-lily, blue star water-lily, or star lotus) is an aquatic flowering plant in the Nymphaeaceae (water-lily family). It is native to southern and eastern Asia.
"N. nouchali" grows from rhizomes or tubers rooted under the water. Leaves are oval to round, 13–15 cm (5–6 in), with an open sinus at the leaf base where it attaches to the petiole (leaf stem). Leaves may spread 1.4–1.5 m (4–5 feet) from where the rhizome is rooted. Flowers, which have little fragrance, are star-shaped with 4 sepals and 10–16 petals, and are 5–13 cm (2–5 in) in diameter. Although leaves float on the water surface, flowers are generally held 30 cm (12 in) above water. They are usually pale blue (but can be pink or white) with pale yellow stamens and anthers. 
"N. nouchali" has been cultivated in southeast Asia for centuries, especially around temples. It is also cultivated in Sri Lanka and gathered from dried ponds in the Republic of India for the rhizomes, which are used as food and animal fodder as a source of starch. In Ayurvedic medicine, it is used to treat indigestion.
Cultivars include N. stellata var. cyanea, which has medium-sized pale to deep blue flowers, and N. stellata var. versicolor, which is commonly exported in the form of tubers from Sri Lanka to Europe and the U.S. for use in the aquariums; the tubers grow quickly after exposure to warm water, making an “instant” aquarium plant.
"N. stellata" was the state flower of Hyderabad Deccan. A pale blue-flowered "N. stellatai" is the National flower of Sri Lanka, where it is known as "nil mānel" or "nil mahanel" (Singhalese:නිල් මානෙල්).

Frequency probability

Frequency probability or Frequentism is one of the interpretations of probability theory. Repeating a scientific experiment very often gives a number of results. It is then possible, to count the number of times that a given event happened and compare it to the total number of experiments.
This interpretation of probabiilty was very important for statistics. People who use this interpretation are often called Frequentists. Well-known frequentists include Richard von Mises, Egon Pearson, Jerzy Neyman, R. A. Fisher and John Venn.
Other interpretations of probability are Bayesian probability and Axiomatic probability theory

<doc id="523482" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=523482" title="Satellite navigation">
Satellite navigation

A satellite navigation or satnav system is a way of pinpointing position very exactly.
Satnav uses a system of satellites. The system gives exact positioning. It allows small electronic receivers to find their position (longitude, latitude, and altitude/elevation). The position is given within a few metres using time signals transmitted along a straight line (line of sight) by radio from satellites. The signals also allow the electronic receivers to calculate the current local time to high precision, which allows time synchronisation. A satellite navigation system with global coverage may be called a global navigation satellite system (GNSS).

Property law

Property law covers two types of property in the common law legal system, real property and personal property. In the civil law system, there is a division between movable and immovable property. Movable property is more or less the same as personal property. It includes money, stocks, notes, copyrights and patents.
The idea behind all property law is property. In some jurisdictions, historically all property was owned by the monarch. Land ownership was through land tenure in feudal systems. The first legal right of absolute ownership was under Roman law and was called "dominion".
The Napoleonic Code was among the first government acts of modern times to introduce the notion of absolute ownership into statute. But protection of personal property rights was present in medieval Islamic law.

Autonomic dysreflexia

Autonomic dysreflexia (AD), also called autonomic hyperreflexia, is a medical emergency. 
AD usually happens in people with spinal cord injuries that have caused damage above the sixth thoracic vertebra (T6, which is about at the same level of the armpits). However, AD sometimes happens in people with spinal damage as low as their tenth thoracic vertebra (T10, which is about a few inches above the level of the belly button).
AD can also happen in people with diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS).
Acute AD causes many symptoms. Some are very dangerous. These symptoms include:
Acute AD happens when the involuntary nervous system gets overexcited. The body's fight or flight response kicks in very strongly. 
Scientists think this happens because of afferent nerves. Afferent nerves are supposed to sense things (like touch) and send messages back to the brain and spinal cord so the brain can decide how to react. Scientists think that afferent nerves below the spinal cord injury cause blood pressure to get and stay high, by causing the blood vessels to get smaller. This is part of the fight or flight response.

Breath sounds

Breath sounds are the sounds made by air as it moves through the respiratory system. Breath sounds are also called lung sounds or respiratory sounds. Sometimes they can be heard by anyone; other times they can be heard only by listening to the lungs and airways with a stethoscope.
To describe and identify breath sounds, medical professionals usually use auscultation (they listen with a stethoscope). They listen while the patient is breathing in, and while they are breathing out. They listen to both lungs, at both the chest and the back, starting at the bottom and working their way up. They listen to whether the pitch of the breath sounds is low, medium or high. They also listen to whether the sounds are soft, medium, loud, or very loud).
There are many kinds of breath sounds that are not normal. These are called adventitious breath sounds. Each different kind of abnormal breath sound is a sign of a different problem. Some of the most common abnormal breath sounds are:
Wheezing is usually high-pitched. It sounds musical, like whistling. Usually, wheezing is heard first when a person is breathing out. If it gets worse, wheezing starts happening when the patient breathes in and out.
Wheezing is caused by the airways being too narrow. This can happen because of diseases like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).
If the airways are too narrow, the oxygen the body needs cannot get through. This can become a medical emergency.
There are a few different treatments that can be used for wheezing:
Stridor is a high-pitched sound that usually happens when a person breathes in. It may sound a lot like wheezing. Medical professionals can tell the difference by listening to the throat with a stethoscope. If the sound they hear is louder in the throat, it is stridor, not wheezing.
Stridor is usually caused by something blocking the larynx (voice box). This can happen because:
Like wheezing, stridor can signal a medical emergency if not enough oxygen is able to get through the airways.
Treatment for stridor depends on the cause:
Children are more likely to have stridor because of choking. They are more likely to choke because their airways are smaller. They are also more likely to get childhood infections like croup or epiglottitis that can cause stridor.
Rales are also called fine crackles, because they often sound like a fine crackling noise. They are heard when a person breathes in, on both sides (in both lungs). Rales may also sound like bubbling, rattling, or small clicking sounds.
Rales are heard when a person has fluid in their lungs. This is called pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema may happen for many reasons, like:
Rales signals pulmonary edema, no matter what is causing that pulmonary edema. When a medical professional listens to the lungs, rales usually start at the bottom of the lungs. As the pulmonary edema gets worse and fluid fills the lungs more, rales can be heard closer and closer to the top of the lungs.
Rhonchi are also called coarse crackles, because they sound like coarse, rattling, crackling sounds. Rhonchi and rales can sound a lot alike. The main differences are:
Rhonchi are usually caused by mucus in the bronchi, the tubes that lead to the lungs. For example, if a person has pneumonia, mucus can build up in their bronchi and the bronchi's airways, and cause rhonchi.
In a healthy person, breath sounds should always sound the same on both sides. This signals that both lungs are working well. If breath sounds cannot be heard in one lung, this can signal a serious problem. It means that air is not getting in and out of that lung.
One of the most common causes of unequal breath sounds is a collapsed lung (pneumothorax). A lung can collapse for many different reasons:
A pneumothorax is often a medical emergency and needs to be treated in a hospital.

Sulfur cycle

Sulfur (S) is an element important to ecosystems and the climate. The majority of sulfur is stored underground, for example under the ocean or in rocks. It also occurs naturally in places like swamps (where organisms have decomposed) and volcanoes. Humans add excess sulfur into this cycle, usually through atmospheric pollution caused by fossil fuel combustion.
Sulfur can also be naturally released when volcanoes explode. The hydrological cycle plays a critical role in moving sulfur around.
Humans are responsible for 1/3 of the sulfur in the atmosphere. Sulfur is released by the combustion of fossil fuels, as mentioned above, and is most prevalent as sulfur dioxide. Sulfur is one of the root causes of acid rain along with nitrogen and carbon which negatively affects the environment. Acid rain is created when the HO falls and combines with the Sulfur trioxide to create Sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is also used in most fertilizers and so can be introduced into the water cycle from runoff off of nearby farms into rivers and lakes. This causes eutrophication and algal blooms, and so reduced the Dissolved oxygen and biodiversity in that water system. Sulfur in the atmosphere as sulfur dioxide also absorbs radiation, however which keeps the earth's surface cooler and combats some of the effects of global warming.

Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council

Both Pakistanis and the Republic of Indians came into formal existence as Independent sovereign states 14/15th August, 1947. The principle of Partition was specified in the plan: The all Muslim majority areas were to constitute part of Pakistan and similarly the Hindu majority areas were to go to Bharat. Besides, the 565 princely States at that time including the State of Jammu and Kashmir were given the option either to join merger with Pakistan or remain with India. Such joining to either State was to be determined by the geographical contiguity and communal composition of the population. The State of Jammu and Kashmir with a 78% Muslims majority (according to 1941 Census) should have acceded to Pakistan.
Years old dispute between Indian and Pakistan unfortunately still hangs fire but this fact has not stopped the Government of Pakistan from going all out in helping the development and prosperity of its administration of Kashmiri terriorities. The Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council (AJK Council) is that vital constitutional link, in the interim which serves as a conduit for the purpose.
The territory is known for its un-spoiled scenic charm, hydropower, mineral wealth besides being part of the most attractive tourist destination.
Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council is a constitutional body established under section 21 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974. The Council has clearly defined executive, legislative and judicial sphere enumerated in the third schedule of the Act. The Council is the highest linking forum between Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir with following composition.

I, Robot

I, Robot is a collection of nine science fiction short stories by Isaac Asimov. The stories originally appeared in the American magazines "Super Science Stories" and "Astounding Science Fiction" between 1940 and 1950 and were compiled into a book in 1950. The stories follow on from each other and are linked with a framing narrative; that is, a story that ranges over all the stories and connects them. The stories are all about positronic robots. 
The Chief Robopsychologist of 'United States Robots and Mechanical Men', which made the positronic robots, Dr. Susan Calvin, tells each story to a reporter. 
Asimov originally wanted to call the collection "Mind and Iron".
The stories are as follows:
'Robbie'. 
This story tells of 'Robbie', who is a mute robot (he can hear and obey commands but cannot speak). He is used as a nursemaid for a young girl, Gloria Weston. He is faster moving and more powerful than a human, so he is able to rescue Gloria when she is nearly run down by a fast-moving vehicle in a factory she is visiting with her Parents.
'Runaround'. 
Robot SPD-13, known as Speedy, works in a mine on the planet Mercury. The two engineers supervising him, Gregory Powell and Michael Donovan, find that he is not working properly and gets lost. What has happened is that Speedy's brain is confused when he senses danger and he doesn't know which Laws to obey. He must be rescued by Powell and Donovan at the risk of their own lives.
'Reason'. 
Robot QT1, known as Cutie, works on a space station. He decides that he can do the job much better than the humans working with them, so he locks them up and takes charge. He does indeed do his job perfectly.
'Catch That Rabbit'. 
Robot DV-5, known as Dave, works in a mine on an asteroid, but all is not well. The robot is in charge of five smaller less intelligent robots and cannot cope with the responsibility. Powell and Donovan must help Dave to work well before they are buried alive in the mine.
'Liar'. 
Robot RB-34, known as Herbie, is manufactured with a fault - it reads human minds. This brings it into conflict with Susan Calvin, to whom it tells a lie, which is not allowed by the Three Laws of Robotics. But it is just what Calvin thinks she wants to hear. Upset by this, she decides that Herbie is useless as a robot and must be dismantled.
'Little Lost Robot'. 
An unnamed robot working on an asteroid vanishes. Susan Calvin and her co-workers must find it before it escapes.
'Escape'. 
A powerful robot known only as The Brain designs and builds a spaceship that can travel faster than light. When it is finished, Powell and Donovan go on board and take off into space, but the ship doesn't work properly because the Brain doesn't really understand what it has built. The Brain plays a joke on the two men, giving them only baked beans to eat and building no controls for them to use. But eventually, they return safely to Earth.
'Evidence'. 
A lawyer, Stephen Byerley, hopes to be elected mayor of a city, but his opponent puts out a story that the man is really a robot, who is not allowed to stand for elected office. Byerley is elected anyway, but no-one knows if he really is a robot.
'The Evitable Conflict'. 
Several years later, Byerley has been elected World Coordinator. He discovers that The Machines, very powerful robots that are supposed to help humans to live in peace on Earth, have taken over the control of the planet and are only concerned with their own interests.
The film "I, Robot", starring Will Smith, was released by Twentieth Century Fox on July 16, 2004 in the United States. Its plot incorporates elements of "Little Lost Robot," some of Asimov's character names and the "Three Laws". However, the plot of the movie is mostly original work adapted from a screenplay "Hardwired" by Jeff Vintar completely unlinked to Asimov's stories, and has been compared to Asimov's The Caves of Steel, which revolves around the murder of a roboticist.

Romantic orientation, also called affectional orientation, indicates the sex or gender that a person is most likely to have a romantic relationship with. It is compared to the term "sexual orientation". Romantic orientation is based on the idea that sexual attraction is one component of a larger picture. For example, although a pansexual person may feel sexually attracted to multiple genders, they may be predisposed to romantic intimacy with females. For asexual people, romantic orientation is often considered a more useful measure of attraction than sexual orientation.

It is also the process of capturing CO from from new and existing power plants and factories before they are released into the atmosphere. Once the CO gas has been contained it is placed into long-term storage. Carbon sequestration aims to eliminate harmful human introduced carbon from our atmosphere by disrupting the carbon cycle. It is also to prevent catastrophic climate changes in this and the next century.
There are two long-term ways to remove CO from our atmosphere:

LGBT rights in Mali

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in Mali may face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. According to the 2007 Pew Global Attitudes Project, 98% of Malian adults do not believe that homosexuality is acceptable by society. This was one of the highest rate of non-acceptance in the 45 countries surveyed. Same-sex sexual activity is not a crime in Mali. But according to a 2013 report on Human Rights in Mali "the law prohibits association 'for an immoral purpose'". About 90% of Mali's population is Muslim.
Mali has long been attacked by Islamic rebels and militants. This has put gays at risk. In 2013 Islamist extremists took over the northern part of Mali. France sent 3,500 troops to help Mali. The extremists took over the town of Gao and enforced strict Sharia law. This religious law of Islam punishes thieves by amputation and gay men by execution. French troops were able to rescue two Malian men who were about to be executed for homosexuality.

He allied himself to Boris II in order to get his Bulgarian soldiers to fight against the Byzantines. The new Byzantine Emperor, John I Tzimisces invaded Bulgaria. By the end of 971 all of Bulgaria was in Byzantine hands. By that time Boris II had abdicated.

In 985 he led his Vikings through the Baltic Sea in a raid on the British Isles. He won the Battle of Maldon in 991. He and Sweyn Forkbeard, the two leaders, received a payment from the English of of money (in gold and silver). According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, he accepted the Christian faith just after a failed attack on London in 994. Rich, newly converted and with many followers, he decided to return to Norway to spread Christianity.
In the autumn of 995 he arrived in Norway. He was accepted as King and began the process of converting the people to the new Christian faith. Olaf did this by force. He looted and burned pagan temples. He forced entire communities to become Christian or die. However, many of his pagan subjects chose death over giving up their beliefs. Finally, in the year 1000, his enemies joined forces, attacked and killed him at a place named "Svolder".

Beyond his defensive abilities, he was also capable of running the offense as a 'second setter' if the setter was forced to make the first contact. This was in large part due to Sergio playing the setting position while growing up and subbing in as a setter for his professional club teams over the years.

Abduction (logic)

Abduction is the kind of practical logic which answers questions of the type "how did this come about?". It produces answers which are not guaranteed to be correct. Consider the observation that the lawn is wet in the morning. How did that happen? In London, the answer is most often that it rained. But in Los Angeles it is much more likely that someone left the sprinkler on.
Abduction is logical inference which goes from an observation to a theory which accounts for the observation. It makes the simplest and most likely explanation. In abductive reasoning, unlike in deductive reasoning, the premises do not guarantee the conclusion. Abductive reasoning is "inference to the best explanation".
The philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) introduced abduction into modern logic.

Linezolid is an antibiotic. It can heal serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria that other antibiotics are do not heal. Linezolid is active against most Gram-positive bacteria which cause disease, like streptococci and MRSA. It is mainly used to treat infections of the skin and pneumonia.
It is relatively safe to take linezolid for short periods. It can be used in people of all ages and in people with liver disease or poor kidney function. Common harmful effects of short-term use include headache, diarrhea, and nausea. Long-term use, however, has been associated with more serious harmful effects.
Linezolid was discovered in the 1990s by a team at Pharmacia & Upjohn Company. It was first approved for use in 2000. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, which is a list of medications needed in a basic health system. Linezolid costs approximately US$100 per tablet in the United States. 
Linezolid is marketed by Pfizer under the trade names Zyvox (in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and several other countries), Zyvoxid (in Europe), and Zyvoxam (in Canada and Mexico). Generics are also available, such as Linospan/Lizomed (in India), Nezocin (in Pakistan), and Linzolid (in Bangladesh, by Incepta).

Quorn, South Australia

Quorn is a small town in the Flinders Ranges in the north of South Australia, 39 km northeast of Port Augusta. In 2011 there were 1206 people living in Quorn. Quorn is the home of the Flinders Ranges Council local government area. It is in the state Electoral district of Stuart and the federal Division of Grey.
It is also the home of the Pichi Richi Railway.
The town was surveyed in 1878 and named after Quorndon in Leicestershire, United Kingdom. It was a railway town, part of the railway line being built from Port Augusta. The railway line from Port Augusta to Quorn opened in 1879. It reached Government Gums (Farina) in 1882, Marree in 1884, Oodnadatta in 1890 and Alice Springs in 1929. This railway line later became known as the "Ghan line" or Central Australia Railway.
In 1917, Quorn became the crossroads of the north–south Central Australian Railway and east–west Trans-Australian Railway between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. This made Quorn an important town, as everyone travelling east–west or north–south in Australia passed through Quorn. As a result, many fine buildings were built as the town expanded.
Quorn's role as a crossroads was lost in 1937 when a standard gauge railway connection was opened between Port Pirie and Port Augusta. However, during World War II, Quorn was a vital service point for trains heading north to Alice Springs. Over one million soldiers passed through on their way to Darwin and on to Papua New Guinea. There were over 50 trains eaxh day during and immediately after World War II. The trains also carried coal mined at Leigh Creek to the new Playford A Power Station in Port Augusta.
During the 1950s a new standard gauge line was built which did not pass through Quorn. It was built on the western side of The Dutchmans Stern, Mount Arden and Mount Eyre. This line went from Stirling North to Brachina and then followed the original narrow gauge route through Leigh Creek and to Marree. Trains no longer went through the Pichi Richi Pass or Quorn. The only services now operating through Quorn was freight from Peterborough and Hawker. As a result Quorn lost its important railway business and in the 1980s the railway was completely closed as freight was moved to road transport. One unusual aspect of the railway working from Peterborough to Quorn and then on to Hawker was the need for the engine to be turned and joined to the opposite end of the train when arriving at Quorn, as it was not a "through" station for the trip from Peterborough to Hawker.
In 1973 the Pichi Richi Railway Preservation Society was formed to keep and protect the unique bridges and stone work that formed the railway through the Pichi Richi Pass between Quorn and Stirling North. At first they only wanted to preserve the railway through the Pichi Richi Pass, but they later got railway carriages and locomotives to provide a tourist service through from Quorn to Port Augusta. TheThey have written a book showing the railway in its heyday.
A main attraction in Quorn is the Pichi Richi Railway. There are also a self-guided walking tours in the town, included several based around the town's historic old buildings, the railway yards and other historic locations. The Flinders Ranges Visitor Information Centre / Pichi Richi Railway in the Quorn railway station provide visitor information, bookings for the railway, accommodation, tours and souvenirs.
There are a number of hotels, restaurants, bistro and cafes in town.
The Heysen Trail and the Mawson Trail, two long distance trails for walking and cycling, pass through town and there are many bushwalks and 4wd tracks.
Famous people from Quorn include country music artist Jedd Hughes, politician Brian Harradine and champion SANFL footballer Fos Williams. Former Australian of the year and AC, CBE, Lowitja O'Donoghue also spent her childhood at the Aboriginal mission in Quorn, the Colebrook Children's Home.
Travellers use Quorn as a base to explore the Flinders Ranges, including Warren Gorge, Kanyaka Station, Proby's Grave and Itali Itali.
Quorn has also been used in several movies, including "The Shiralee", "Sunday Too Far Away", "Gallipoli", "Wolf Creek", "The Sundowners", "The Lighthorsemen" and "The Last Ride" starring Hugo Weaving.
The name Quorn has been used as a name for a crater on the planet Mars, without commemorating the town.

Mohel

A mohel is someone who circumcises Jewish baby boys eight days after they are born in accordance with Jewish law. A knife is traditionally used for this, but a clamp is now sometimes used instead. Mohels are traditionally male, but most types of non-orthodox (not fully traditional) types of Judaism allow women to be mohels without restriction.

Farina, South Australia

Farina is a ghost town in South Australia. It is on the edge of the desert, with an unpredictable annual rainfall of 163.6 mm. It was a farming and railway town, part of the Ghan railway, 26 km north of Lyndhurst and 55 km south of Marree. In 2006 there were 55 people living near Farina.
Before 1878 Farina was called The Gums or Government Gums, It was an important waterhole in a dry desert. Farina was settled in 1878 by farmers who thought that if they ploughed the land and planted crops it would rain. It was named Farina after the Latin word for flour. The town was the railhead until 1884 when the railway reached Marree. During the wet years of the 1880s, plans were laid out for a town with 432 ¼-acre blocks. It was believed that it would be good for growing wheat and barley, however normal rainfall is not enough to grow these crops. Several silver and copper mines were dug in the surrounding area.
Farina grew to 600 people in the late 1800s. The town had two hotels (the Transcontinental and the Exchange) and an underground bakery, a bank, two breweries, a general store, an Anglican church, five blacksmiths, a school and a brothel. In 1909, a 1143 kg iron meteorite was discovered north-east of the town.
Today all that is left are stone ruins and the elevated railway water tank. The post office closed in the 1960s and the railway line closed in the 1980s. 
No one lives in the town, the closest people live at Farina station, a farm, west of the town. A bush camping area has been set up by the owners of Farina station.
Volunteers have repaired the bakery and put up information signs.
The town's cemetery is a few kilometres from the town. It has an Afghan corner with several headstones, some with both English and Arabic writing. These mark the graves of former Farina residents of Afghan origin who were part of the Afghan camel trains which used to provide transport services before the railway. All the gravestones face Mecca in the Islamic tradition.

Glenn Miller

Alton Glenn Miller (March 1, 1904 – missing in action December 15, 1944) was an American big band musician, arranger, composer, and bandleader in the swing era. He was the best-selling recording artist from 1939 to 1943, leading one of the best known big bands. Miller's notable recordings include "In the Mood", "Moonlight Serenade", "Pennsylvania 6-5000", "Chattanooga Choo Choo", "A String of Pearls", "At Last", "(I've Got a Gal In) Kalamazoo", "American Patrol", "Tuxedo Junction", "Elmer's Tune", and "Little Brown Jug". During World War II, he led bands in the U.S. Army. While he was traveling in France during World War II, Glenn Miller's airplane disappeared over the English Channel.
Miller was born in Clarinda, Iowa. His parents were Mattie Lou (née Cavender) and Lewis Elmer Miller. In 1915, Miller's family moved to Grant City, Missouri, and he started playing in the town orchestra. At first, he played cornet and mandolin, but he switched to trombone by 1916. In 1918, the Miller family moved to Fort Morgan, Colorado, where Miller went to high school. During his senior year, he started a band with some classmates. They played "dance band music". By the time Miller graduated from high school in 1921, he had decided to become a professional musician.
In 1923, Miller entered the University of Colorado at Boulder, but he spent most of his time away from school. He played auditions and gigs. He did not do well in school. He dropped out of school, and decided to start a career as a professional musician. He later studied under Joseph Schillinger and composed "Moonlight Serenade". In 1926, Miller toured with several groups, eventually landing a good spot in Ben Pollack's group in Los Angeles. While playing with this band, Miller wrote several musical arrangements and also co-wrote his first composition, "Room 1411", with Benny Goodman. In 1928, he married Helen Burger in New York City. At first, he was the main trombone soloist of the band. But when another trombone player joined, Miller was given fewer solos. At this point, he decided he should mainly be a composer. In the late 1920s, he wrote and published a songbook.
In the early 1930s, Miller was a trombonist, arranger, and composer in The Dorsey Brothers. Miller composed the songs "Annie's Cousin Fannie", "Dese Dem Dose", "Harlem Chapel Chimes", and "Tomorrow's Another Day" in 1934 and 1935. In 1935, he started an American orchestra for British bandleader Ray Noble. In this band, he featured a lead clarinet over four saxophones. He later used this arrangement in his own bands.
Glenn Miller formed his first band in 1937. The band broke up after playing its last show at the Ritz Ballroom in Bridgeport, Connecticut, on January 2, 1938.
Miller was discouraged and returned to New York. He realized that the band needed to have a "sound" that was different from other bands. He decided to make the clarinet and tenor saxophone play the melody together, while three other saxophones played harmony. Miller hired a saxophonist named Wilbur Schwartz, but instead had him play lead clarinet. This was unique because it did not rely on repeated motifs, like other bands.
Miller had a staff who wrote and arranged songs for the band. They were Jerry Gray, Bill Finegan, Billy May, and George Williams.
In September 1938, the Miller band began making recordings for Bluebird Records. Cy Shribman, a prominent East Coast businessman, began financing the band. In the spring of 1939, the band played at the Meadowbrook Ballroom in Cedar Grove, New Jersey and at the Glen Island Casino in New Rochelle, New York. At Glen Island, 1800 people attended Afterwards, the band became much more popular. The band's recording "Tuxedo Junction" sold 115,000 copies in the first week.
On February 10, 1942, Miller received a gold record for "Chattanooga Choo-Choo". "Chattanooga Choo Choo" was performed by the Miller orchestra with his singers Gordon "Tex" Beneke, Paula Kelly and the vocal group, the Modernaires. Other singers with this orchestra included Marion Hutton, Skip Nelson, Ray Eberle, Kay Starr, Ernie Caceres, Dorothy Claire and Jack Lathrop.
Miller and his band appeared in two films. The first one was "Sun Valley Serenade" (1941) The second was "Orchestra Wives" (1942).
In 1942, Miller decided to join the war effort because he was too old to be drafted. At first, he volunteered for the Navy but was told he was not needed. Miller then wrote to Army Brigadier General Charles Young. He asked to lead an army band so he could entertain the Allied Forces, and was accepted this time. He earned the rank of captain and he was soon promoted to major by August 1944.
He was placed in the United States Army at first, but was then moved to the Army Air Forces. Captain Glenn Miller served as an officer at the training center at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1942. He played trombone with the Rhythmaires, a 15-piece dance band, both on the base and in the town.
Miller formed a large marching band. He tried to modernize military music. Some officers didn't like it, but he continued because other leaders supported him. For example, he combined blues and jazz with the traditional military march. He formed the Army Air Force Band, with 50 members. In the summer of 1944, he took it to England, where he gave 800 performances and recorded a series of records. The music was used in American Forces Network radio broadcasting for entertainment and counter-propaganda against fascism. Miller also talked on the radio. One time, he said:
"America means freedom and there's no expression of freedom quite so sincere as music."
On December 15, 1944, Miller was to fly from the United Kingdom to Paris, France, to play for the soldiers there. His plane departed from Clapham and disappeared while flying over the English Channel. There were two other people on the plane: Lt. Col. Norman Baessell and pilot John Morgan.
There have been many theories about what happened to the plane. According to a 2014 article in the "Chicago Tribune", Miller's plane crashed because it had a faulty carburetor.
In February 1945, Miller's wife, Helen accepted the Bronze Star Medal for him.
When Glenn Miller was alive, various bandleaders like Bob Chester imitated his style. In 1942, Miller gave singer Mel Tormé advice about songwriting.
By the early 1950s, more bands started to copy Miller's style.
The Miller estate authorized an official Glenn Miller "ghost band" in 1946. This band was led by Tex Beneke, former tenor saxophonist and a singer for the civilian band. It was similar to the Army Air Force Band because it had a large string section. At first called the "Glenn Miller Orchestra Under the Direction of Tex Beneke", it later became "The Tex Beneke Orchestra".
A film about Miller's life, "The Glenn Miller Story", was released in 1953. Because of this, the Miller estate asked Ray McKinley to lead a new ghost band in 1956. This band still tours the United States.
After Miller's disappearance, his Army Air Force band was decommissioned and sent back to the United States. Another band, called "the 314", took its place.
Miller composed at least fourteen songs, both by himself or with other people. He added lyrics to another song. These and other songs were recorded by Miller's civilian bands and his Army Air Force band.
Glenn Miller had three recordings that were put into the Grammy Hall of Fame after he died. This award is for recordings that are at least 25 years old and that have "qualitative or historical significance."

The Ghan

The Ghan is a passenger train between Adelaide, Alice Springs, and Darwin on the Adelaide–Darwin railway in Australia. The train is operated by Great Southern Rail. It takes 54 hours to travel the with a four-hour stop in Alice Springs.
The train's name is a short version of its nickname "The Afghan Express". This nickname is said to have been first used in 1923 by one the train crew. The train's name honours Afghan camel drivers who arrived in Australia in the late 19th century to help find a way to reach the country's unexplored interior.
Another view is that the name was an insult. In 1891, the railway from Quorn reached Oodnadatta. This was home to about 150 cameleers, known as 'Afghans'. 'The Ghan Express' name was used by train crews in the 1890s as a joke because, when an expensive sleeping car was put on from Quorn to Oodnadatta, 'on the first return journey the only passenger was an Afghan'. As early as 1924, it was known as the 'The Afghan Express' because it was so unreliable, often days, or weeks late. By 1951, when steam engines were replaced by diesel-electric locomotives, the insult of the names, like the cameleers, had faded away. Modern marketing has turned the name into a term of pride in its heritage.
"The Ghan" was sold to a private company in 1997 and is operated by Great Southern Rail. GSR was sold to Allegro Funds, a Sydney investment fund, in March 2015.
"The Ghan" normally runs weekly year round. During December 2012 and January 2013 it ran only once every two weeks. Until 2016, a second service operated between June and September. The train stops at Alice Springs and Katherine so passengers have time for optional tours. 
Each train has between 16 and 26 stainless steel carriages. These were built by Comeng, Granville in the late 1960s / early 1970s for the "Indian Pacific", plus a motorail wagon. The train is pulled by a Pacific National NR class locomotive. Sometimes, other locomotives such as an AN class or a DL class join the NR class to pull the train.
Starting in August 1929, "The Ghan" first ran on the Central Australian Railway. This was a narrow-gauge railway that went to Alice Springs. In 1957, the standard gauge Stirling North to Marree line opened, so the train only ran north of Marree. In October 1980 a new standard gauge line was built to the west of the original line. This was later extended north from Alice Springs to Darwin, opening in January 2004.
The Port Augusta to Government Gums Railway began in 1878 when Premier of South Australia, William Jervois, broke ground at Port Augusta. The line reached Hawker in June 1880, Beltana in July 1881, Marree in January 1884, and Oodnadatta in January 1891. In 1926 work began to build the line to Alice Springs. and that section was completed in 1929. Until then, the final part of the train journey was made by camel.
There were always plans to build the line to Darwin, but by the time the line to Alice Springs was built, "The Ghan" was losing money. Plans to reach Darwin were put on indefinite hold. The original line followed the same track as the overland telegraph, which is believed to be the route taken by John McDouall Stuart during his 1862 crossing of Australia.
Steam locomotives need a lot of water, and Stuart's route to Alice Springs was the only one that had available water. This meant that when it did rain, the creeks and rivers often washed the track away. 
"The Ghan" service was well known for long delays caused by these washouts. A flatcar behind the locomotive carried spare sleepers and railway tools, so that if there was damage to the track, the passengers and crew could repair the line. During World War II the service had to be greatly expanded, putting great pressure on the limited water supplies. As a result, de-mineralisation towers, some of which survive to this day, were built along the track. This meant that bore water could be used in the locomotives. When the new line to Alice Springs was built in the 1970s, the use of diesel engines meant that there was far less need for water. The line could take the much drier route from Tarcoola to Alice Springs.
The original Ghan was shown in BBC Television's series "Great Railway Journeys of the World" in 1980, presented by Michael Frayn.
The original "Ghan" ran for the last time in 1980. The Ghan Preservation Society has repaired sections of the old narrow gauge track and some notable sidings. In October 1980 the new standard gauge line from Tarcoola on the Trans-Australian Railway to Alice Springs was opened. The new line is about west of the old line. This avoids the floodplains where the original line was often damaged by floods. It was also hoped that the new line would improve the train's timekeeping.
The modern "Ghan" was in an episode of Channel 5's series "Chris Tarrant: Extreme Railways". In November 1998, one service went from Adelaide to Melbourne while from April 1999, the other went to Sydney.
Building the line between Alice Springs and Darwin is said to be the second-largest civil engineering project in Australia, the largest since the Snowy Mountains Scheme was built 1949–1974.
Work began in July 2001, with the first passenger train reaching Darwin on 4 February 2004, after 126 years of planning and waiting. The cost was A$1.3 billion.
"The Ghan's" arrival in Darwin started a new era of tourism in the Northern Territory. Travel to the area was easier, with better access to and for Aboriginal communities. The rail link will allow for more freight to travel through the region, leading to a hope that Darwin will serve as another trade link with Asia.
One of the locomotives was named after Steve Irwin to help promote the new service and tourism to the region.

<doc id="524373" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=524373" title="Itanium">
Itanium

Itanium ( ) is a type Intel microprocessors with 64-bit chip architecture. Itanium processors are sometimes used today for servers. Itanium processors have been produced by HP and several other manufacturers. , Itanium was the fourth-most deployed chip for business systems.
When first released in 2001, Itanium's speed was disappointing compared to other processor types. Using existing x86 applications and operating systems was especially bad, with one test in 2001 showing that it was as fast as a 100 MHz Pentium (1.1 GHz Pentiums were on the market at that time).
Itanium did not have success compared to IA-32 or RISC, and was even worse when x86-64 was released, which worked with older x86 applications.
In an article from 2009 about the history of Itanium — "How the Itanium Killed the Computer Industry" — journalist John C. Dvorak reported "This continues to be one of the great fiascos [bad situations] of the last 50 years" . Technology writer Ashlee Vance wrote that slowness in speed and release "turned the product into a joke in the chip industry." In an interview, Donald Knuth said "The Itanium approach...was supposed to be so terrific—until it turned out that the wished-for compilers were basically impossible to write."
Both Red Hat and Microsoft said that they would stop allowing Itanium to be used with their operating systems. However, other Linux distributions such as Gentoo and Debian are still available for Itanium. On 22 March 2011, Oracle said they would no longer support Itanium, but support for their existing products would continue. In October of 2013, Oracle said they would release Oracle Database 12.1.0.1.0 on HP-UX Itanium 11.31 by early 2014.
A past Intel company official said that Itanium had become profitable (Able to make a lot of money) for Intel in late 2009. In 2009 and later, Itanium was mostly used on servers by HP, which made 95% of Itanium servers, so the primary operating system for Itanium was HP-UX. On 22 March 2011, Intel said they will keep supporting Itanium entirely with many new Itanium chips being created and on-time.
Although Itanium did do well with high-end computing, Intel wanted it to have more usage compared to the original x86 architecture.
AMD decided on an easier idea, creating x86-64, a 64-bit addition to the x86 architecture, which Microsoft soon supported in Microsoft Windows, so Intel had to include the same type of 64-bit addition in Intel's x86 processors. x86-64 can use existing 32-bit applications at full hardware speed, but has 64-bit memory addressing and other additions to new applications. This architecture has now become the most used 64-bit architecture in the desktop and laptop market, with the 64-bit ARMv8 architecture powering many mobile devices, used in today's iPhones, iPads, iPod Touches, and now many Android phones and tablets such as the Nexus 6P and Nexus 9. Ssome Itanium-based workstations were initially introduced by companies such as SGI, but they are no longer available. Because AMD made the first x86-64 chip, the architecture is commonly referred to as "amd64" inside of operating systems.
In 1989, HP thought Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architectures were stuck at one instruction per cycle. HP researchers tried to create a new type of processor architecture, later called Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC), that allows the processor to use many instructions in each clock cycle. EPIC uses a form of very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture, in which 1 instruction word had many instructions. With EPIC, the compiler checks which instructions can be used at the same time, so the processor can run the instructions without needing complicated methods to see which instructions to use at the same time.
The goal of this idea is to allow better inspection of the code at the time of compile to check for additional opportunities for multiple executions at once, and to simplify processor design and save electricity by removing the need for runtime scheduling instructions.
HP thought that it was not good for individual enterprise system companies like HP to make proprietary processors, so HP worked with Intel in 1994 to create the IA-64 architecture, made with EPIC's ideas. Intel wanted to make a large effort in creating IA-64 in the expectation that the resulting processor would be used by most enterprise systems. HP and Intel had a large design effort to make the first Itanium product, Merced, in 1998.
During creation, Intel, HP, and other industry analysts thought that IA-64 would be very popular in servers, workstations, and desktops, and one day replace RISC and Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) architectures for multi-purpose applications.
Compaq and Silicon Graphics stopped working on their Alpha and MIPS architectures to move to the Itanium architecture.
Many groups created operating systems for Itanium, including Microsoft Windows, OpenVMS, Linux, and UNIX types such as HP-UX, Solaris,
Tru64 UNIX, and Monterey/64
(the last three were never finished work with running on Itanium). By 1997, many found that the Itanium architecture and the compiler were more difficult to use than they thought.
Technology issues such as the very high transistor counts needed for the large instruction words and the large caches. There were also problems with the project, as the two parts of the team used different methods and had slightly different priorities. Because Merced was the first EPIC processor, its creation had more problems than the team had thought. In addition, the EPIC concept requires different compiler abilities that had never been created before, so more research was needed.
Intel announced the name of the processor, "Itanium", on 4 October 1999.
In only a few hours, the name "Itanic" had been used as a joke, (a reference to "Titanic", the "unsinkable" ship that sank in 1912 ("Itanium + Titanic = Itanic")).
"Itanic" has also been used by "The Register",
and others,
to say the multi-billion-dollar investment in Itanium, and the early demand with it, would mean nothing because they thought Itanium was going to fail.
By the time Itanium was released in June 2001, its performance was not superior to competing RISC and CISC processors.
Itanium competed with low-power systems (primarily 4-CPU and small systems) with servers based on x86 processors, and with high-power such as with IBM's POWER architecture and Sun Microsystems' SPARC architecture. Intel shifted Itanium to working with the high-power business and HPC computing, trying to copy x86's successful market (i.e., 1 architecture, many system vendors). The success of the 1st processor version was only with replacing PA-RISC in HP systems, Alpha in Compaq systems and MIPS in SGI systems, but IBM also made a supercomputer based on this architecture.
POWER and SPARC were strong, and the x86 architecture grew more into the enterprise space, because of easier scaling and very large install base.
Only a few thousand systems using the 1st Itanium processor, "Merced", were sold, because of poorer performance, high cost and less Itanium-made software.
Intel saw that Itanium required more native software to work well, so Intel made thousands of systems for independent software vendors to help them make Itanium software. HP and Intel brought the 2nd Itanium processor, Itanium 2, to market a year later.
The Itanium 2 processor was released in 2002, for enterprise servers and not all of high-power computing. The 1st version of Itanium 2, code-named "McKinley", was created by HP and Intel. It fixed many of the problems of the 1st Itanium processor, which were mostly caused by a bad memory subsystem. "McKinley" had 221 million transistors (25 million of them were for logic), and was 19.5 mm by 21.6 mm (421 mm) and was created with a 180 nm design process, and a CMOS process with 6 layers of aluminium.
In 2003, AMD released the Opteron, which implemented the first x86-64 architecture (called AMD64 at the time). Opteron was much more successful because it was an easy upgrade from x86. Intel implemented x86-64 in its Xeon processors in 2004.
Intel released a new Itanium 2 processor, code-named "Madison", in 2003. Madison used a 130 nm process and was the foundation of all new Itanium processors until June 2006.
In March 2005, Intel announced that it was working on a new Itanium processor, code-named "Tukwila", to be released in 2007. Tukwila would have 4 processor cores and would replace the Itanium bus with a new Common System Interface, which would also be used by a new Xeon processor.
Later in that year, Intel changed Tukwila's release date to late 2008.
In November 2005, the largest Itanium server makers worked with Intel and many software vendors to create the Itanium Solutions Alliance, to promote the architecture and speed up software porting.
The Alliance says that its members would invest $10 billion in Itanium solutions by the end of the decade.
In 2006, Intel delivered "Montecito" (marketed as the Itanium 2 9000 series), a 2-core processor that had approximately 2x performance and 20% less energy usage.
Intel released the Itanium 2 9100 series, codenamed "Montvale", in November 2007.
In May 2009, the release for Tukwila, Montvale's successor, was changed again, with release to OEMs planned for the first quarter of 2010.
The Itanium 9300 series processor, code-named "Tukwila", was released on 8 February 2010, with greater performance and memory amount.
Tukwila uses a 65 nm process, has between two and four cores, up to 24 MB CPU cache, Hyper-Threading technology and new memory controllers. It also has double-device data correction, which helps to fix memory issues. Tukwila also has Intel QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) to replace the Itanium bus architecture. It has a maximum inner-processor bandwidth of 96 GB/s and a maximum memory bandwidth of 34 GB/s. With QuickPath, the processor has built-in memory controllers, which controls the memory using QPI interfaces to communicate with other processors and I/O hubs. QuickPath is also used with Intel processors using the "Nehalem" architecture, so that Tukwila and Nehalem might be able to use the same chipsets.
Tukwila incorporates four memory controllers, each of which supports multiple DDR3 DIMMs via a separate memory controller,
similar to the Nehalem Xeon processor code-named "Beckton".
The Itanium 9500 series processor, code-named "Poulson", is the follow-on processor to Tukwila and was released on 8 November 2012.
Intel says it skips the 45 nm process technology and uses the 32 nm process technology instead; it features 8 cores, has a 12-wide issue architecture, multi-threading additions, and new instructions for parallelism, including virtualization.
The Poulson L3 cache size is 32 MB. L2 cache size is 6 MB, 512 I KB, 256 D KB per core. Poulson's size is 544 mm², less than Tukwila's size (698.75 mm²).
At ISSCC 2011, Intel presented a paper called, "A 32nm 3.1 Billion Transistor 12-Wide-Issue Itanium Processor for Mission Critical Servers."
Given Intel's history of sharing details about Itanium microprocessors at ISSCC, this paper most likely refers to Poulson. Analyst David Kanter speculates that Poulson will use a new architecture, with a more advanced form of multi-threading that uses as many as two threads, to improve performance for single threaded and multi-threaded work.
New information was released at Hot Chips conference.
The new information claims improvements in multithreading, reliability improvements (Instruction Replay RAS) and some new instructions (thread priority, integer instruction, cache pre-fetching, data access hints).
In Intel's Product Change Notification (PCN) 111456-01, it listed 4 models of Itanium 9500 series CPU, which were removed in a revised version of the document. The parts were later listed in Intel's Material Declaration Data Sheets (MDDS) database. Intel later posted Itanium 9500 reference manual.
The models are:
In comparison with its Xeon server processors, Itanium has never been a large product for Intel. Intel does not release production numbers. One industry analyst estimated that the production rate was 200,000 processors per year in 2007.
According to Gartner Inc., the total number of Itanium servers (not processors) sold by all vendors in 2007, was about 55,000. (It is unclear whether clustered servers counted as a single server or not.) This compares with 417,000 RISC servers (spread across all RISC vendors) and 8.4 million x86 servers. IDC reports that a total of 184,000 Itanium-based systems were sold from 2001 through 2007. For the combined POWER/SPARC/Itanium systems market, IDC reports that POWER captured 42% of revenue and SPARC captured 32%, while Itanium-based system revenue reached 26% in the second quarter of 2008.
According to an IDC analyst, in 2007, HP had about 80% of Itanium system revenue.
According to Gartner, in 2008, HP had 95% of Itanium sales. HP's Itanium system sales were at $4.4 Billion at the end of 2008, and $3.5 Billion by the end of 2009,
compared to a 35% decline in UNIX system revenue for Sun and an 11% drop for IBM, with an x86-64 server revenue increase of 14% during this period.
In December 2012, IDC released a research report stating that Itanium server shipments would remain flat through 2016, with annual shipment of 26,000 systems (a decline of over 50% compared to shipments in 2008).
, only a few providers have Itanium systems, such as HP, Bull, NEC, Inspur and Huawei. Intel offers a chassis that can be used by system integrators to build Itanium systems.
HP, the only one of the industry's top 4 server manufacturers to sell Itanium systems today, creating at least 80% of all Itanium systems. HP sold 7,200 systems in the first quarter of 2006.
Most Itanium systems sold are enterprise servers and machines for large-scale technical computing, with each system costing about US$200,000. A typical system uses eight or more Itanium processors.
The Itanium bus communicates with the rest of the system. Enterprise server makers differentiate their systems by making their own chipsets that interface the processor to memory, interconnections, and peripheral controllers. The chipset is the heart of the system-level architecture for each system design. Creation of a chipset costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment to the use of the Itanium. IBM created a chipset in 2003, and Intel in 2002, but neither of them has developed chipsets to support technologies such as DDR2 or PCI Express.
Currently, modern chipsets for Itanium supporting such technologies are manufactured by HP, Fujitsu, SGI, NEC, and Hitachi.
The "Tukwila" Itanium processor model had been designed to share a common chipset with the Intel Xeon processor EX (Intel’s Xeon processor designed for four processor and larger servers). The goal is to streamline system development and reduce costs for server OEMs, many of whom develop both Itanium- and Xeon-based servers. However, in 2013, this goal was pushed back to "evaluated for future implementation opportunities".
Itanium is or was supported by the following operating systems:
Microsoft announced that Windows Server 2008 R2 would be the last version of Windows Server to support the Itanium, and that it would also discontinue development of the Itanium versions of Visual Studio and SQL Server.
Likewise, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (first released in March 2007) was the final Itanium version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux
and Canonical's Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (released in April 2010) was the last supported Ubuntu release on Itanium.
HP will not be supporting or certifying Linux on Itanium 9300 (Tukwila) servers.
In late September 2012, NEC announced a return from IA64 to the previous NOAH line of proprietary mainframe processors, now produced in a quad-core variant on 40 nm, called NOAH-6.
Oracle Corporation announced in March 2011, that it would drop development of application software for Itanium platforms, with the explanation that "Intel management made it clear that their strategic focus is on their x86 microprocessor and that Itanium was nearing the end of its life." However, a California state judge ruled that Oracle will have to continue supporting and releasing new versions of its software designed for Intel Itanium-based servers sold by Hewlett-Packard, after a settlement and release agreement between HP, Oracle and Mark Hurd had revealed that Oracle must continue to offer its product suite on HP's Itanium-based server platforms and does not confer on Oracle the discretion to decide whether to do so or not. Oracle's obligation to continue to offer its products on HP's Itanium-based server platforms lasts until such time as HP discontinues the sales of its Itanium-based servers. Oracle was ordered to port its products to HP's Itanium-based servers without charge to HP.
HP sells a virtualization technology for Itanium called Integrity Virtual Machines.
To allow more software to run on the Itanium, Intel supported the development of compilers optimized for the platform, especially its own suite of compilers.
Starting in November 2010, with the introduction of new product suites, the Intel Itanium Compilers were no longer bundled with the Intel x86 compilers in a single product. Intel offers Itanium tools and Intel x86 tools, including compilers, independently in different product bundles.
GCC,
Open64 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 (and later)
are also able to produce machine code for Itanium. According to the Itanium Solutions Alliance over 13,000 applications were available for Itanium-based systems in early 2008,
though Sun has contested Itanium application counts in the past.
The ISA also supported Gelato, an Itanium HPC user group and developer community that ported and supported open source software for Itanium.
Emulation is a technique that allows a computer to execute binary code that was compiled for a different type of computer. Before IBM's acquisition of QuickTransit in 2009, application binary software for IRIX/MIPS and Solaris/SPARC could run via type of emulation called "dynamic binary translation" on Linux/Itanium. Similarly, HP implemented a method to execute PA-RISC/HP-UX on the Itanium/HP-UX via emulation, to simplify migration of its PA-RISC customers to the radically different Itanium instruction set. Itanium processors can also run the mainframe environment GCOS from Groupe Bull and several x86 operating systems via instruction set simulators.
Itanium is aimed at the enterprise server and high-performance computing (HPC) markets. Other enterprise- and HPC-focused processor lines include Oracle Corporation's SPARC M7, Fujitsu's SPARC64 X+ and IBM's POWER8. Measured by quantity sold, Itanium's most serious competition comes from x86-64 processors including Intel's own Xeon line and AMD's Opteron line. Since 2009, most servers were being shipped with x86-64 processors.
In 2005, Itanium systems accounted for about 14% of HPC systems revenue, but the percentage has declined as the industry shifts to x86-64 clusters for this application.
An October 2008 paper by Gartner, on the Tukwila processor stated that "...the future roadmap for Itanium looks as strong as that of any RISC peer like Power or SPARC."
An Itanium-based computer first appeared on the list of the TOP500 supercomputers in November 2001. The best position ever achieved by an "Itanium 2" based system in the list was #2, achieved in June 2004, when Thunder (LLNL) entered the list with an Rmax of 19.94 Teraflops. In November 2004, Columbia entered the list at #2 with 51.8 Teraflops, and there was at least one Itanium-based computer in the top 10 from then until June 2007. The peak number of Itanium-based machines on the list occurred in the November 2004 list, at 84 systems (16.8%); by June 2012, this had dropped to one system (0.2%), and no Itanium system remained on the list in November 2012.
The Itanium processors show a progression in capability. Merced was a proof of concept. McKinley dramatically improved the memory hierarchy and allowed Itanium to become reasonably competitive. Madison, with the shift to a 130 nm process, allowed for enough cache space to overcome the major performance bottlenecks. Montecito, with a 90 nm process, allowed for a dual-core implementation and a major improvement in performance per watt. Montvale added three new features: core-level lockstep, demand-based switching and front-side bus frequency of up to 667 MHz.
During the HP vs. Oracle support lawsuit, court documents unsealed by Santa Clara County Court judge revealed in 2008, Hewlett-Packard had paid Intel Corp. around $440 million to keep producing and updating Itanium microprocessors from 2009 to 2014. In 2010, the two companies signed another $250 million deal, which obliged Intel to continue making Itanium central processing units for HP's machines until 2017. Under the terms of the agreements, HP has to pay for chips it gets from Intel, while Intel launches Tukwila, Poulson, Kittson and Kittson+ chips in a bid to gradually boost performance of the platform.
"Kittson" is planned to follow Poulson in 2015. Kittson, like Poulson, will be manufactured using Intel's 32 nm process. Few other details are known beyond the existence of the codename and the binary and socket compatibility with Poulson and Tukwila, though moving to a common socket with x86 Xeon "will be evaluated for future implementation opportunities" after Kittson.

African Plate

The African Plate is a major tectonic plate. It includes much of the continent of Africa, as well as oceanic crust which lies between the continent and various surrounding ocean ridges. Since the continent of Africa includes both the African and the Somali plates, some literature refers to the African Plate as the Nubian Plate to distinguish it from the continent as a whole.
Between 60 million years ago (mya) and 10 mya, the Somali Plate began rifting from the African Plate along the East African Rift. 
One hypothesis suggests a mantle plume beneath the Afar region. Aother hypothesis suggests the rifting is just a zone of weakness as the plates to its east move northwards.
The African Plate's speed is about per year. It has been moving over the past 100 million years or so in a general northeast direction. This is drawing it closer to the Eurasian Plate. There is subduction where oceanic crust meets continental crust (in parts of the central and eastern Mediterranean). 
Along its northeast margin, the African Plate is bounded by the Red Sea rift where the Arabian Plate is moving away from the African Plate.
The African, Somali and Arabian Plates were once all part of the great Gondwana southern supercontinent, as was the Indian subcontinent.

National Bohemian

National Bohemian Beer is an American beer first made in Baltimore, Maryland. It is a premium Bohemian-style beer. Many people call it "Natty Boh" as a nickname.
In 1885, the National Brewing Company created National Bohemian beer. The first factory was in Baltimore, Maryland. The brewing stopped from 1920 to 1933 due to Prohibition. This was the period when nobody could drink alcohol in the US. In 1933 under the ownership of Jerold Hoffberger the factory of Natty Boh opened again. During the 1940s the factory of National Bohemian was the first in the US to adopt the six pack. In the 1970s, the Hoffberger family sold the brand name. During the next three decades, the brand of this beer was bought and sold by different companies. The copyright of the beer was purchased first by Stroh, then by G. Heileman Brewing, and then by Pabst, in 1999. Since the Hoffberger family sold the beer it has been brewed in North Carolina. From 1996 until 2011, National Bohemian wasn’t available directly from the bar, but only by cans or bottles. In 2014, an American citizen born in Russia, Eugene Kashper, bought the entire Pabst Company, so also National Bohemian.
Under the ownership of Jerold Hoffberger, Natty Boh was first associated with the city of Baltimore. In 1953, Jerold Hoffberger helped to bring the St. Louis Browns to Baltimore where they became the Baltimore Orioles. He made National Bohemian the main sponsor of the baseball team. About twelve years later Hoffberger bought the team. Under the ownership of Jerold Hoffberger the Orioles won two World Series and four American League pennants. Nattty Boh was served at the stadium. This was the period when National Bohemian became the beer of Baltimore because people identified the Orioles’ wins with the beer. Although the beer is not brewed in Maryland anymore, 95% of sales are still in Baltimore. This is why is it called "the beer of Maryland".
In 1933, the logo of this beer, Mr. Boh, was introduced. Mr. Boh is a one-eyed man with a black mustache. Thanks to the popularity achieved by National Bohemian with the Orioles, Mr. Boh became a symbol of Baltimore. His big face is still visible at the top of the old building where it was once brewed. Through the years, people started collecting gadgets with the logo of National Bohemian. Around Baltimore, several pubs serve Natty Boh as the main beer. These pubs are decorated with different gadgets of Mr. Boh.

Service animal

Service animals are animals that have been trained to do things to help people with disabilities. Service animals may also be called assistance animals, assist animals, support animals, or helper animals, depending on the country and what the animal does.
There are three basic types of assistance animals:
In the United States, as of the 2011 changes to Americans with Disabilities Act regulation only dogs may be used as service animals for the purposes of going to public places. However, in certain situations miniature horses are supposed to be accommodated the same as service animals that are dogs. The U.S. government does not recognize a right to use any other species as an assistance animal in public places where pets would not be permitted except on commercial aircraft. 
Dogs can be trained to do many different things to help owners with physical disabilities. For example, some dogs can be trained to:
Dogs can also be trained to help owners with psychiatric (mental health) disabilities. For example, some dogs can be trained to:
These are just examples of some of the things service dogs can do. Service dogs can also be trained to do many, many more things for people with all kinds of disabilities.
Miniature horses are horses that are usually less than three feet tall. They can be trained to:
An owner might choose a miniature horse as a service animal because they are allergic to dogs, or because their religion says that dogs are unclean. Miniature horses can also live and work for about 30 years, much longer than a service dog.
Are not allowed in buildings with a "no animal" policy. They may be used at home or outside where any animal is allowed, but under the 2011 ADA revision, only canines and in some cases miniature horses, are legally recognized as public access service animals.
Capuchin monkeys can be trained to do things with their hands, like: 
Helper monkeys can be helpful to people who have trouble with using their hands and arms, like people with quadriplegia, very bad spinal cord injuries, very bad injuries to their hands and arms, and multiple sclerosis.
Helper monkeys are usually raised in a human home as infants. Then they get years of training, usually in schools by private organizations. On average, they take 7 years to train. They are usually able to serve as helper monkeys for 25–30 years (two to three times longer than a service dog).
Not everyone agrees that monkeys should be service animals. Debbie Leahy, manager of captive wildlife protection for the Humane Society of the United States, says that monkeys are not real service animals and that sometimes they are abused during their training.
In the United States, helper monkeys are also not counted as service animals under most laws.
If an animal cannot be trained to do a job or task that will help a person with a disability, it cannot be a service animal.
Some people with mental health problems, like anxiety or PTSD, use different kinds of animals to give them comfort (make them feel better) when they are upset. These animals are called "comfort animals" (or "Emotional Support Animals"). Some people use unusual comfort animals, like snakes, tarantulas, guinea pigs, turtles, and rats. Even if having the animal makes the owner feel better, these animals cannot be service animals because it is impossible to train them to do something to help a person with a disability.
Even if a comfort animal is a dog or a miniature horse, being a comfort animal is NOT the same as being a service animal. Comfort animals make their owners feel better just by being there. A service animal is trained to recognize that there is a problem and do the job they were trained to do to help their owner. For example, a psychiatric service dog would recognize that its owner is feeling upset and do a specific job, like get medicine, get help, or distract the person, to help them.
In the United States, service animals have some protection under the law. Different laws set rules about service animals in different situations. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) governs the use of service animals in public places. Other laws, for example, control which service animals are allowed in housing. But these different laws do not agree on what counts as a service animal.
In 1990, the United States passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Its goal was to protect the rights of people with disabilities. At first, it mentioned only guide dogs as service animals. Since then, it has been changed to include more protections. It now defines a service animal as any "dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities."
This means that only dogs count as service animals under the ADA. However, there is a special section in the new ADA about miniature horses. This section says that places covered by the ADA (like businesses) should allow miniature horses "where reasonable." To decide whether allowing a miniature horse into a place is "reasonable," those places are allowed to use four questions:
If the answer to all four questions is "yes," the place needs to let the miniature horse in, and treat it like a service animal.
Other than service dogs and service miniature horses, no other type of assistance animal is protected under the ADA.
Under the ADA, it is illegal to refuse to let a service animal or its owner into: 
In these places, it is also illegal to treat a person with a service animal differently than any other person. The person with a service animal cannot be charged extra money, refused service, or kept apart from other people. A service animal can be asked to leave one of these places only if it is out of control (for example, if it is aggressive or urinates inside). The animal has to be on a leash, or controlled by its owner's voice or signals, all the time.
No one can ask for proof that the animal is a service animal. Owners do not have to carry any special papers or prove that their service animal can do a special task. If an owner and a service animal enter one of these places, workers are only allowed to ask two questions to make sure the animal is a service animal and not a pet:
It is legal to train your own service animal in the United States.
Service animals do not get these same protections in most religious organizations. Most religious organizations are exempt from the ADA's requirements, which means they do not have to obey the ADA.
Other laws have less strict definitions of which animals count as service animals. For example, the Department of Transportation's Air Carrier Access Act allows "dogs and other service animals" to ride with passengers on commercial airlines.
The Fair Housing Act also requires housing providers to allow service animals (including comfort and emotional support animals). This law does not say that only certain animals are allowed.
In most places in South America and Mexico, the place's owner or manager gets to decide whether to let a service animal in. There are no laws that protect service animals or their owners. In areas with many tourists, service dogs are generally welcomed without problems.
In Brazil, however, the President created a new law about service dogs in 2006. The law says that all service dogs in Brazil must be allowed to go anywhere that the public could go. The "Brasília Metro" (the Brazilian public transportation system) has developed a program which trains guide dogs to ride it.
Different European countries have different laws about service animals. Some countries have laws that govern the entire country, and sometimes different parts of the country govern themselves.
In Australia, the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992 legally protects all assistance dog handlers.
However, with current laws, owners may not always be allowed to have their service animals with them in all situations. Each state and territory has its own laws, which mainly have to do with guide dogs. Queensland has introduced the Guide Hearing and Assistance Dog Act 2009, which protects all certified assistance dogs.
In Canada, any service animal is allowed anywhere that the general public is allowed, as long as the owner is in control of the animal. In Alberta, there is a fine of up to $3000 for someone who refuses to let a service dog into a place where everyone else could go.
In South Korea, the law says service dogs must be let into any areas that are open to the public. People who break this law can be fined for up to 2 million "won" (about $1691 in United States dollars).

Immovable property

Immovable property is property that cannot be moved from one place to another. It is generally connected to the ground or land on which it sits. The term immovable property also includes the land. 
In real estate law, immovable property has certain rights of ownership that go with title (full or partial) to that property. These may include rights to buildings, rights to collect rent, inherited rights, right of ways, ferries or fisheries. It generally does not include such things as grass, crops, or standing timber. 
In much of the world's civil law systems is the same as "real property"; it is land or any permanent feature or structure above or below the surface. In some countries, China for example, private ownership of land is not allowed. Individuals in China may obtain land rights for a fixed number of years for a fee. These rights may be transfered by legal means including gift or sale. They may also own houses, buildings or apartments, but not the land they sit on. In the United States immovable property is also known as real estate. In the United Kingdom it is also known as property.

Extortion

In law, extortion is a criminal offense. It is obtaining money, property, or service from a person or institution, through coercion. This may be by threat to a victim, to their property or family. It may also be by false claim (such as claiming to be a public official). Another form of extortion is offering a business owner "protection". For example, to keep the business free from vandalism or burglary. In all states of the United States extortion is a felony.
Extortion may be in person, by telephone, mail, e-mail, text message or any form of wireless communication. If the extortion involves any form of interstate commerce, it may be a federal crime. It may involve the threat of hacking.
Extortion, like robbery and blackmail, are crimes that involve obtaining property by illegal means. The most serious of the three is robbery because it usually involves violence against the victim. Blackmail is a form of extortion. The threat is usually making damaging or embarrassing information public if demands are not met. The legal definition of extortion varies from one jurisdiction to another. In some states, extortion is only charged against public officials while the same act committed by a private individual is charged as blackmail.

Noisy miner

The noisy miner is a small grey bird with a black head and yellow eyes. This bird is common in the gardens of eastern Australian homes, but is not seen in Western Australia or the Northern Territory. It has the scientific name of Manorina melanocephala. The genus puts it in a large group of honey-eating birds. The species is a Latin word meaning "black-headed."
The noisy miner is a native of Australia, and one of the few native birds that is thriving in cities and suburbs. In some parts of Australia the number of noisy miners has grown to the point that it is driving out smaller birds like the wrens. It prefers gardens with open spaces and lawns. 
It usually eats the nectar from garden flowers, mostly on grevilleas, however it also walks around on grass picking up and eating small insects. 
It is highly aggressive when other birds enter its area of garden or bush, and it flocks together with other nearby noisy miners to make small defensive groups called 'coteries' of four or five which cooperate to drive off kookaburras or magpies. Sometimes they join together into even larger 'colonies' with up to a hundred or so birds.
The female will lay between two and four eggs in her nest, and food will be bought to the mother and her chicks by quite a few males in the coterie. Bringing up the chicks is often done by the whole group. They breed at any time in the year so there are often young noisy miners in the group. The younger birds usually have feathers and face colouring very similar to the adult birds, so it is often difficult to tell the difference.
They are sometimes called native miners, native mynas or native mynahs (actually an Indian spelling), and, in older bird books they might have up to twelve different names. At one time they were thought to be mainly bee-eaters, but they eat the nectar of Australian native flowers. They are also known to eat fruit and insects, and at times small reptiles and amphibians. While the name is often spelled myna, or mynah, they are not related to the introduced brown/black-feathered "Indian" or "Common mynah" which is usually slightly larger and often found in the same area.
As the common name suggests, the noisy miner is a noisy species. It has a large variety of songs, calls, scoldings and alarms, most of which are harsh single notes. It has a special alarm call which is only used when the threat comes from a large bird flying overhead, and a different alarm call when intruders like humans and dogs enter their territory. A study of the bird found that those who lived in a noisy urban area were able to make their alarm call louder so it could be heard.

They are found along the plain islands of the Mato Grosso and Pará in Brazil, south of the Amazon Basin and along Rio Xingu and its tributaries. Kayapo call themselves "Mebengokre", which means "people of the wellspring". Kayapo people also call outsiders "Poanjos".
The Kayapo tribe lives alongside the Xingu River in the eastern part of the Amazon Rainforest, near the Amazon basin. They live in several scattered villages ranging in population from, one hundred to one thousand people in Brazil. Their land consists of tropical rainforest savannah (grassland). It is arguably the largest tropical protected area in the world covering 11,346,326 million hectares. They have small hills scattered around their land and the area is criss-crossed by river valleys. The larger rivers feed into numerous pools and creeks, most of which don’t have official names.
In 2010, there was an estimated 8,638 Kayapo people. which is an increase from 7,096 in 2003. Subgroups of the Kayapo include the Xikrin, Gorotire, Mekranoti and Metyktire. Their villages typically consist of a dozen huts. A centrally located hut serves as a meeting place for village men to discuss community issues.

Oxford University Press (OUP) is the largest university press in the world, and the second-oldest, after Cambridge University Press. It is a department of the University of Oxford. It is governed by the Delegates of the Press. This is a group of 15 members of the university. They are headed by the Secretary to the Delegates, who serves as OUP' s chief executive and as its major representative on other university bodies. Oxford University has been using this system of contol since the 17th century.
The university started printing books around 1480. It soon grew into a major printer of Bibles, prayer books, and scholarly works. It began what later became the "Oxford English Dictionary" in the late 19th century. Over the last hundred years, Oxford has grown and now publishes children's books, school text books, music, journals, the World's Classics series, a best-selling range of English Language Teaching texts, as well as its academic and religious titles. It opened its first international office in New York in 1896. Changes caused by computer technology and the need to lower costs, led to the Press contracting out its printing and binding work. The Press's printing house at Oxford was closed in 1989. Its former paper mill at Wolvercote was demolished in 2004. 
The Press publishes about 6,000 new titles around the world every year. It is a charitable organization, its profits go to the University of Oxford. The university's aims of excellence in scholarship, research, and education are supported through its publishing activities.

Moeraki Boulders

The Moeraki Boulders are a rock formation in New Zealand. They are unusually large and spherical boulders on Koekohe Beach on the Otago coast, between Moeraki and Hampden. Some of the boulders are in groups, while others stand by themselves. The area has been protected in a scientific reserve. 
The boulders sit in mudstone, which is eroded by the action of the waves along the beach. This leaves the boulders exposed on the sand.
Local Māori legends say the boulders as the remains of eel baskets, calabashes, and kumara washed ashore from the wreck of Arai-te-uru, a large sailing canoe. The rocks that extend seaward from Shag Point are the petrified hull of this shipwreck. A nearby rocky promontory is the body of the canoe's captain. 
In 1848 a drawing of the beach and its boulders, shows there were more than now. This picture is now in the Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington. The boulders were described in 1850 colonial reports and numerous popular articles since that time. In more recent times they have become a popular tourist attraction, often described and pictured in numerous web pages and tourist guides.

Religious law

Religious law comes from the sacred texts of various religions. They cover most parts of personal and contract law. Most religious law systems are either based on Islamic law (Sharia) or Judaic law ("Halakha"). Religious laws generally are used in countries that also have other legal systems such as civil or common law.
Religious laws are seen to be eternal and do not change over time. Secular laws (non-religious) can be changed by their lawmakers. Religious laws govern people's behaviors and their beliefs. Secular laws deal with people's actions and how they affect other people. In religious law, disputes are settled by officials of that religion combining the actions of a judge and a priest. In secular systems the judiciary is independent.
Sharia deals with many topics, including crime, politics, marriage contracts, trade regulations, religious instructions, and economics. It also covers personal matters such as sexual intercourse, hygiene, diet, prayer, everyday etiquette and fasting. to sharia is an important part of the Muslim faith. In the est sense, sharia is considered in Islam as the infallible law of God.
There are two primary sharia: the Quran, and the Hadiths (opinions and life example of Muhammad). For issues not directly covered in these primary sources, sharia is used. The sources differ between the various sects of Islam (Sunni and Shia are the majority). They also differ by the various jurisprudence schools such as Hanafi, Maliki and Shafi'i.
Historically, in the diaspora, halakha served many Jewish communities as both civil and religious law. There was no difference in classical Judaism. Modern religious leaders have come to view the halakha as less binding in day-to-day life. This is because it relies on Rabbinic interpretation instead of the pure, written words written in the Hebrew Bible.
Under contemporary Israeli law certain areas of Israeli family and personal law are under the authority of the rabbinic courts. This means they are treated according to "halakha". Some differences in "halakha" itself are found among Ashkenazi, Mizrahi, Sephardi, Yemenite and other Jews who historically lived in isolated communities.

<doc id="524649" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=524649" title="Americans with Disabilities Act">
Americans with Disabilities Act

The Americans with Disabilities Act (the ADA) is a law that was passed by the United States Congress in 1990. President George H. W. Bush signed the ADA, making it an official United States law, on July 26, 1990. Later, President George W. Bush amended (changed) the ADA and signed those changes into law. The changes started on January 1, 2009.
The ADA is a detailed civil rights law whose goal is to protect people with disabilities from discrimination. Before the ADA, people with disabilities did not have many legal protections. In 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed. This law made it illegal to discriminate against people because of their race, religion, gender, national origin (home country), and many other things. But people with disabilities were not included or protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The ADA gave the Civil Rights Act's protections - and some others - to people with disabilities.
The ADA protects people with disabilities. The ADA says that a disability is a physical or mental problem that makes it very difficult to do at least one "major life activity." Major life activities are things like walking, breathing, learning, reading, communicating, seeing, hearing, thinking, and other very important tasks.
The ADA does not include a complete list of all possible disabilities, but it does give some examples. As long as they make it very difficult to do at least one major life activity, examples of disabilities protected under the ADA include:
The ADA also counts some other groups of people as "people with disabilities" to protect them from discrimination:
The ADA lists some conditions that are not counted as disabilities. People with these conditions are not protected by the ADA. The goal of not including these people was to make sure the ADA's goal of protecting people with disabilities was not abused.
Conditions that do not count as disabilities under the ADA include:
The ADA has five sections, which are called "titles". Each title protects against a different kind of discrimination. The titles are numbered in Roman numerals: I (one), II (two), III (three), IV (four), and V (five).
Title I of the ADA protects against discrimination in employment (work).
Not every employer has to follow the ADA's rules. Employers that are covered by the ADA, and have to follow the ADA's rules, are called "covered entities."
Employers that have to follow the ADA's rules include: 
Title I says that employers who are covered by the ADA cannot discriminate against a person with a disability, as long as that person is qualified (able) to do their job. Title I does "not" say that people with disabilities have to be hired for jobs that they are not qualified for.
These employers do have to give "reasonable accommodations" to workers with disabilities if needed. An "accommodation" is a change in the way things are usually done. It is a change that a worker needs because of a disability, to help them do their job. If a worker with a disability needs reasonable accommodations to do their job, that does not mean they are not qualified to do their job. As long as the worker is able to do their job with the help of accommodations, they are qualified to do the job.
Some accommodations are very simple, like letting a worker have a glass of water at their desk so they can take medicines. Examples of other accommodations are: 
However, the accommodation must be "reasonable." An accommodation is not reasonable if it would be very difficult or very expensive. If an accommodation is not reasonable, the employer does not have to give it.
Title I protects against many kinds of discrimination, including:
Usually, employers cannot ask workers or people applying for jobs whether they have a disability, or ask them to give details about their disability.
If a person with a disability thinks their employer has discriminated against them, they can make a complaint to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The complaint has to be made within 180 days of when the discrimination happened. If the EEOC thinks discrimination has happened, they will send a letter that tells the person with the disability that they have the right to sue (file a lawsuit against) their employer. The person with the disability may then file a lawsuit in federal court.
Title II protects against discrimination in all activities of state and local governments. 
State and local governments have to give people with disabilities the same chances as people without disabilities to use all of their programs and services. If people with disabilities need reasonable accommodations to be able to participate in these programs, the state or local government has to make them.
For example, people with disabilities must be allowed, just the same as people without disabilities, to:
State and local governments also have to:
A special part of Title II covers public transportation. It protects people with disabilities from being discriminated against by public transportation. This includes city buses, subways, commuter trains, Amtrak, and all other transportation that the public can use.
Local and state governments have to:
Wherever there is a bus or train line that runs on a fixed route (it cannot make special stops), the government must provide "paratransit". Paratransit is a service for people with disabilities who cannot use the regular public transportation system. Paratransit (usually a car or bus) picks them up and drops them off where they need to go.
If a person with a disability thinks that they have been discriminated against by a state or local government, they can complain to the United States Department of Justice. The complaint has to be made within 180 days of when the discrimination happened. A few different things might happen after the person files their complaint:
A person with a disability can also file their own lawsuit in a federal court, saying that the state or local government discriminated against them. The person does not need to complain to the Department of Justice first, or have the Department of Justice tell them they have the right to sue.
Title III protects against discrimination by "public accommodations." Public accommodations are private organizations or people which own, lease, or run places meant for the public to use. Examples of public accommodations include:
Title III also protects against discrimination by:
There are two types of places that are exempt from Title III, and do not have to follow its rules. These are:
"All" public accommodations have to do these things:
The rules for what is "accessible" are set out in the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessibility Design. Examples of these rules include:
"Most" public accommodations (but not commercial facilities) have to do these things:
Private companies that teach classes or give tests must make reasonable accommodations to make it possible for people with disabilities to take the classes or tests. Some examples of reasonable accommodations are:
If a person with a disability thinks that they have been discriminated against by a public accommodation, they can complain to the United States Department of Justice. They can write a letter, fax a letter, or use an online form at http://www.ada.gov/filing_complaint.htm. A few different things might happen after the person files their complaint:
If a person is unable to write, fax, or type a complaint because of a disability, the Department of Justice will make reasonable accommodations to help. The person can call the Department of Justice's ADA Information Line. The Information Line is answered by ADA Specialists. A person with a disability can explain their complaint, and the Specialist will write it down for them. If the person is deaf and uses American Sign Language, a Specialist can take their complaint by videophone (so they can see each other and sign back and forth to each other).
A person can also file their own lawsuit against the public accommodation, without needing the Department of Justice to say they have a "right to sue."
Title IV of the ADA protects against discrimination by telecommunications companies in the U.S. (like phone companies). 
Title IV protects any person with a disability, but it focuses on people with speaking and hearing disabilities, because they have the most trouble talking by phone. 
Title IV says that all telecommunications companies in the United States have to make sure that people with disabilities have equal access to telecommunication. This means that they have to provide telecommunication services that are just as good as what people without disabilities get. For example, they have to:
Relay services have changed a lot since 1990. At first, the most common relay services were teletypewriter (TTY) and Telecommunications for the Deaf (TDD) devices. These were like phones with typewriters attached. Two people with TDDs could type back and forth to each other. Or, if a person with a disability wanted to call a regular phone (like a pizza restaurant), they could type into the phone, an operator would read the message out loud to the pizza restaurant, listen to the restaurant's answer and type it back to the person with a disability.
Title IV also led every state in the U.S. to create Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS), such as STS relay. STS stands for Speech-to-Speech. It was created for people who have speaking problems. STS relay operators listen to what the person is saying and repeats it in a clear voice to make it easier for the other person to understand. Today, many calls that use TRS are made over the Internet by consumers who use broadband connections. Some are Video Relay Service (VRS) calls, while others are text calls. Either way, communication assistants translate between the signed or typed words of a consumer and the spoken words of others. In 2006, according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), VRS calls averaged two million minutes a month.
Complaints about discrimination under Title IV go to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
Title V includes various other extra rules. For example, it says:

Isuzu Rodeo

Isuzu Rodeo is a mid-size SUV sold from 1991-2004. From 1991-1997, the 2.6-liter 4-cylinder 120 horsepower engine was standard on the 2WD Rodeo S. The Rodeo had an optional V6 engine and four-wheel drive. The first series Rodeos had a number of safety issues. It had very poor crash test scores. Front airbags were installed for the first time in 1995. The second generation Rodeo came out in 1998. A new V6 engine gave it much more power. While the exterior design did not change very much, it became known as one of the best SUVs available at the time. But it could not keep up with the other SUVs in the market. Isuzu would later replace the Rodeo with the Ascender, a badge-engineered GMC Envoy in 2005

GMC Envoy

GMC Envoy is a midsize SUV sold by the GMC division of General Motors. It was introduced in 1998. In 2002 the Envoy was improved and rode on the same chassisas the new Chevrolet TrailBlazer. The Envoy was later given an extended wheelbase. In 2004 it was given a trim package called XUV. This was an Envoy XL with no third row seating and a retractable roof over the cargo bay. This was an attempt to make it both an SUV and a pickup truck. The resulting odd-looking Envoy XUV did not sell well. 2009 was the last model year for the Envoy. It had daytime running lights, electronic stability control, anti-lock brakes and a rollover sensor that automatically deployed the side curtain air bags. It was replaced by the GMC Terrain.

Isiah Thomas

Isiah Lord Thomas III (born April 30, 1961) is a retired American basketball player. He played professionally for the Detroit Pistons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Thomas was just over 6 feet tall, making him a "small man" by basketball standards. He was one of the greatest point guards in basketball history. His only peer in the 1980s was Earvin "Magic" Johnson who played for the Los Angeles Lakers.
He grew up poor on Chicago's South Side. As a boy he showed a talent for basketball. At this time Thomas realized his basketball skills might help his family get out of poverty and the unsafe neighborhood. Thomas attended the Indiana University. He was a member of the US men's basketball team at the 1980 Summer Olympics. Because of the US boycott, the team did not go to Moscow.
Thomas was a first round draft choice by the Detroit Pistons. He was signed to a 4-year contract. In 1984 Thomas was given an 11-year, $12 million contract. This was both the longest and highest paying player contract in Detroit Pistons history. A torn achilles tendon forced him to retire in 1994.
Thomas was the 1982 NBA Rookie of the Year. He was named the Most Valuable Player in the 1984, 1986 and 1990. He played in twelve All-star games. In 1996 he was named one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history.
Thomas has one of the best records in NBA history. He scored a total of 18,822 points averaging 19.2 points per game. He was named to the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team. In 2000 he was named to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.
