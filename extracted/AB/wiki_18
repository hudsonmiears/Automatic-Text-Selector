Usora (river)

Usora is left tributary of the Bosnia in central Bosnia. The total length of the river Usora – from sources below the top of the mountain Očauš to the mouth above the Doboj is about 82 kilometers. The town of Teslić, through which it flows, bears the local name Velika Usora (Great Usora), since under the city at a place called Sastavci meets with his same named, but a lot less left tributary Mala Usora (Little Usora). It also comes from the mountain masiff Uzlomac – Borja – Očauš below it in smaller distances rises more Bosnia river and their tributaries, as well as the basin Vrbanja river and Ukrina. In its upper reaches, the river makes a wide loop around Borja, from its southwest to northeast slopes.
Great Usora created by merging Gomjenice and Brkića stream. Small Usora springs below (south) of the main road M-4 (Banja Luka – Matuzići, some 10 km west of Pribinić). Before Sastavci locality, right tributary to it are: Mišića rijeka, Great Ostružnja, Inova , Miljkovača, Velika rijeka (Great river), Brezna and smaller streams, as well as left: Rankovića rijeka, and Gračanica.
In much of the flow Ukrina is flooding river but the increasingly frequent flooding causes significant damages.
In the early Bosnian history Usora belonged to gold-bearing river, and it is believed that this is still in its upper course along with the many large and small tributaries and streams. Obvious hydro-energy potential Usora is permanently unused, and fish stocks almost negligible, especially if one takes into account the centuries-old discharging untreated waste industrial water Chemical Distillation of wood in Teslić.

<doc id="566022" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=566022" title="Lateen">
Lateen

A lateen (from French "latine", meaning "Latin") or latin-rig is a triangular sail set on a long yard mounted at an angle on the mast. It runs in a fore-and-aft direction.
A square sail is a very simple device. It catches a following wind and pushes the vessel forward. The lateen sail is more complex. It is set at an angle to the wind. It works be creating a difference in air pressure between the two sides (concave and convex) of the sail. This is the same way a fore-and-aft sail works. This is why the lateen sail is considered the ancestor of the fore-and-aft sail. The advantages of the lateen sail is that it is effective in lighter winds. It causes less drag and so is more efficient. It allows the vessel to sail much "closer to the wind" (meaning it can sail at up to about 45 degrees into the wind). This made the lateen sail a very important invention.
The lateen sail did not directly come from the square sail. There was an intermediate sail type called the lug sail. It was one of the earliest fore-and-aft rigs. It was developed for use on the Indian Ocean. Sailors knew that the wind does not always come from behind the vessel. They learned that the square sail could be made more efficient by turning it on the mast so it remained at a right angle to the wind. When used with a keel and some form of steering, it provided more options. Instead of simply sailing downwind, the vessel could move in different directions relative to the direction of the wind. If the wind came from the beam (side of the ship), rotating the sail became less effective. But, if the luff (edge of the sail) was pointed into the wind and kept taut, the sail would provide forward movement. They may not have understood the reasons why it worked only that it worked. This could be made more effective if the yard (or spar) holding the sail is sloped downward into the wind. From this discovery came the lug, then the lateen. 
In ancient history the square sail was used in the Mediterranean. It was used on seagoing ships of the Phoenicians, Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. In Northern Europe at this time, they only used the square sail. This was even after the ships in the Mediterranean were using the triangular lateen sails.
The 15th and 16th century caravel was a favorite type of ship used in the Portuguese and Spanish voyages of discovery. In addition to their distinctive single sterncastle, they carried lateen sails. During this time the caravel developed into a very fast and highly maneuverable ship. Two of Christopher Columbus's ships, the "Niña" and the "Pinta" were caravels. He repeatedly praised the "Niña" as his fastest and favorite ship.

Tacking (sailing)

Tacking or coming about is a term in sailing that means the boat is changing directions by turning the bow of the vessel in relationship to the wind. It also means the course you are on relative to the direction of the oncoming wind. A tack with the wind blowing over the port (left) side of the boat is called a "port tack". A tack with the wind coming over the starboard side of the boat is called a "starboard tack". The sailboat's helmsman is responsible for communicating with the rest of the crew when making a tacking maneuver. When making a tack the helmsman calls out "ready about!" When the crew is ready they call out "ready", and the maneuver is started. The opposite of a tack (into the wind) is a jibe (changing direction while moving with the wind).
In order to tack a boat moving into the wind, some speed is necessary. If too much time is taken in completing the tack, the forward momentum will be lost and the boat may move backwards. If a sailboat is caught going directly into the wind, it is called "in irons." This stops all forward motion of the boat. A tacking maneuver is a basic skill that is learned with practice. The maneuver also is different in a single person small sailboat than in a 40 or 50 foot racing sailboat.
Beating is the procedure by which a ship moves on a zig-zag course to make progress directly into the wind (upwind). No sailing vessel can move directly into the wind (though that may be the desired direction). Beating allows the vessel to advance indirectly upwind.
A ship that is beating will sail as "close to the wind" as possible. This position is known as close hauled. In general, the closest angle to the wind that a ship can sail is around 35 to 45 degrees. Some modern yachts can sail very near to the wind, while older ships, especially square-rigged ships, cannot sail very close to the wind.

Historia szlachecka z roku 1811 i 1812 we dwunastu księgach wierszem") is a long poem by Polish romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz. It is regarded as a national epic. It was first published in Paris in 1834. The poet was then in exile in France. "Sir Thaddeus" is a story of a conflict between two noble families, the Soplicas and the Horeszkos. The time is 1811 and 1812, shortly before Napoleon invaded Russia. When attacked by Russian soldiers, both families fought against the enemy. The conflict between the families was ended with the marriage of Thaddeus Soplica and Sophia Horeszko. 
Adam Mickiewicz was born in the East of the former Polish-Lithuanian state. Because of that he called Lithuania his mother-country.

Linea dell'impero

The Linea dell'impero(in English: "Flight of the Empire") was the longest flight made by the Italian airline "Ala Littoria" in the years preceding World War II and was considered the most prestigious Italian air route of the time. It connected Rome with Mogadishu in Italian East Africa, and from 1939 the route could be travelled without a change of airplane. The route was a key political and symbolic connection between Rome, the capital of Italy, and Italy's colonies in Libya and East Africa.
The line was opened after the Italian conquest of Ethiopia in 1936 and was followed by the first air links with the Italian colonies in Italian East Africa, which had begun in an experimental way from 1934. The route was enlarged to 6,379 km and initially joined Rome with Addis Ababa via Syracuse, Benghazi, Cairo, Wadi Halfa, Khartoum, Kassala, Asmara, Dire Dawa. There was a change of aircraft in Benghazi (or sometimes in Tripoli).
The route was carried out in three and a half days of daytime flight and the frequency was four flights per week in both directions. Later from Addis Ababa there were three flights a week that continued to Mogadishu, capital of Italian Somalia.
In 1939 the time taken to travel the route was reduced with the introduction of the new Savoia-Marchetti "Marsupiale", an aircraft that did not require change of aircraft. The flight initially over the so-called Italian Mare Nostrum lasted just 2 days and connected Rome to Tripoli-Cairo-Kassala-Asmara-Addis Abeba-Mogadiscio. In early 1940 it was the fastest and longest route in Africa and was the most prestigious line of Italian civil aviation.
In summer 1940, with the start of WWII the route was militarized and controlled by the "Comando Servizi Aerei Speciali". In the first months of 1941 it was definitively closed when Italy lost the Italian East Africa.
Only in the 1950s the route was reopened with flights of Alitalia (the national airline of Italy that substituted "Ala Littoria" after WW2) from Rome to Addis Ababa and Mogadishu, done with Douglas Dc-6 and later jets.

It was released on July 25, 2014 and was one of two movies released in 2014 which were about the mythical warrior, the other being The Legend of Hercules; unlike the former, this film gained mixed to positive critical reviews and was a box office success.
Hercules (Dwayne Johnson), is the leader of a gang of mercenaries, comprised of the prophet Amphariaus (Ian McShane), the thief Autylocus (Rufus Sewell), the barbarian Tydeus (Aksel Hennie), the huntress Atalanta (Ingrid Bolsø Berdal) and his nephew Iolaus (Reece Ritchie). Hercules is supposedly the lovechild of Zeus and a mortal woman who engaged in 12 legendary labors, but was betrayed by Hera, who induced him with madness, which caused him to kill his wife and children while he was visiting King Eurystheus (Joseph Fiennes). Despite Hercules' origins not being clearly established in the movie, he displays powerful godlike strength and unmatched skill in combat. However, he is frequently plagued by the memory of murdering his family and visions of the three-headed hellhound Cerberus.
After saving his nephew on the coast of Macedonia, Hercules celebrates with his team. As they drink in a tavern, the group are approached by Ergenia (Rebecca Ferguson, the daughter of Lord Cotys (John Hurt) who wants Hercules to train the Thracian armies to defend his kingdom from the warrior king Rhesus, to which the hero accepts. The band are welcomed to Thrace by Cotys and General Sitacles (Peter Mullan). However, Rhesus has reached the Bessi people Cotys insists that Hercules leads the army into battle to defend the tribe, despite their lack of training. However, they arrive too late as Rhesus has cursed the Bessi into turning against the Thracians.

Rigging

The rigging of a sailing ship is made up of the ropes and/or chains used to support the ship's masts, yards and sails. The standing rigging is used to support the masts. The running rigging supports the yards and sails. Some types of sailboats that have unsupported masts do not have any rigging. These include the junk rig and catboat rigs. Bermuda sloops with a single mast and one headsail use fairly simple rigging. Cutter-rigged ketches and schooners have the most complex rigging.
A sailing ship's standing rigging is made up of the ropes used to support the masts, yards and booms. Most modern sailing vessels use wire rope for the the standing rigging. Modern standing rigging is regularly checked for tension using a special gauge. Adjusting the tension is done by use of a turnbuckle. Ropes, wires or rods that run fore-and-aft along the centerline which stabilize the masts or spars are called stays. Those that from the mast to the bow are called forestays. Those that run from the mast to the stern are called backstays.
The running rigging of a sailing vessel controls the sails. The running rigging is usually made up of various kinds of rope (ropes are also called lines). It uses blocks and Sheaves to adjust the length of the ropes. A block is a kind of pulley. A sheave is the grooved wheel inside the block. Larger sailing boats and ships use winches. The adjustability of the running rigging allows the boat to perform various maneuvers such as tacking and jibing. Common to all sailboats are the outhaul and the downhaul. The outhaul pulls the sail to the free end of the boom. The downhaul keeps the boom from rising on the mast.

Djoser

Djoser (other names include Netjerikhet, Tosorthos, and Sesorthos) was the first Pharaoh, or king of the Third Dynasty of Egypt, c. 2670 BCE. He is known for the building of the first pyramid built in Egypt, the Step Pyramid at Saqqara. The Third Dynasty, based in Memphis, was the beginning of the Old Kingdom, a period of stability, achievement and unity.
There have been claims that he was not the first king, as the Abydos King List and the Turin King List give a king by the name of Sanakht. There is no archaeological evidence to support this, and most experts agree that Djoser was the first. He ruled for at least 20 years, but he had so many temples, tombs and monuments built that some experts say he may have ruled for up to 30 years.
There is a painted limestone statue of Djoser, which is the oldest discovered life sized Egyptian statue. It was found in Saqqara during archaeological digging in 1924-1925. The statue is now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
The building of the Step Pyramid was quite an achievement. It is the first massive monument built in stone, about 62 meters in height. It is surrounded by a 10 meter high wall, which encloses an area of about 16 hectares. It shows that the kingdom must have been stable and wealthy to have spent so much time and money to build it. The man who designed it and supervised the building was Imhotep, the oldest named architect known to us. Thousands of years later, Djoser was known to Egyptians as the "opener of stone", recognising his legacy of using stone for buildings.
The Egyptians believed in a story of how Djoser was able to end a famine. There is no evidence from the time of his rule, but an engraved stone, a stele, was made 2000 years later giving the details. Even if the story is a legend, it does show that Djoser was remembered as a great pharaoh. Egypt had been suffering a famine fro seven years, when the god of the Nile, Khnum, spoke to Djoser in a dream. Djoser rebuilt Khnum's temple on Elephantine, an island near modern Aswan. This pleased the god, and the famine ended. The ruins of the temple are still visible today.

Gofred abo Jeruzalem wyzwolona

Gofred abo Jeruzalem wyzwolona is a Polish translation of Torquato Tasso's "Gerusalemme liberata" ("Jerusalem Delivered") (by Piotr Kochanowski. It was first printed in Cracow (Kraków) in 1618. 
In 16th century Polish literature flourished. One thing, however, lacked. There was no long epic poem in Poland. Jan Kochanowski, the greatest poet of the Renaissance in Kingdom of Poland, wrote many lyrical pieces and some stories in verse. His nephew, Piotr Kochanowski was the first poet to give an epic poem to the Poles. He did not write a poem on his own. He translated two epic masterpieces from the Italian. They were "Jerusalem Delivered" by Torquato Tasso and "Orlando Furioso" by Ludovico Ariosto. 
The historical importance of Piotr Kochanowski's translation lies in its form. The poet used exactly the same form, ottava rima. It is an Italian strophe of eight lines. It is built of 11-syllable lines (endecasillabo in Italian). It rhymes abababcc. The strophe was used by Italian poets from 14th century. There are many long poems in ottava rima in Italian literature of 15th and 16th centuries. There were not any in Polish literature of the time. Piotr Kochanowski introduced the strophe into Polish poetry. There was another poet, Sebastian Grabowiecki, who used it earlier in Poland. He dit it, however, in one short poem. Into English poetry ottava rima was introduced many years before by Thomas Wyatt. In 17th century ottava rima became one of the most important verse forms in Poland.
Piotr Kochanowski's version of "Jerusalem Delivered" is still widely read. There are many new editions. His translation is used at school.

Bermuda rig

A Bermuda rig, also called a Marconi rig, is a fore-and-aft rig that uses a triangular mainsail. The sail is usually attached to a boom at its foot. It has a number of variations. Due to the physics of the wind, the tall thin sails of the Bermudian rigs have more power sailing into the wind than other types. This is why it is such a popular rig with modern sailboats. It was called a Marconi rig after the inventor Guglielmo Marconi because its system of mast stays that looked like the early wireless masts. However, the name Bermuda rig was in use two centuries earlier. It came from the late 1600s when European sailors noticed how well the small sloops in Bermuda worked.
It was developed in Bermuda in the 17th century. It was based on the leg-of-mutton sail. The strong gusty winds around the Bermuda islands made sailing around the waters difficult to navigate. The prevailing winds came out of the west which lined up with the islands. In addition, the number of reefs around the islands required caution. Most other sail designs did not address these issues.
It is widely thought the first of these designs was a fore-and-aft rig built by in the 17th century by a Dutch-born Bermudan. While his name is not remembered, he may have seen the Moorish lateen rigs that were widely used during the time Spain ruled Holland. The Dutch modified early lateen rigs turning the yards into angled masts. This design was called "bezaanjacht" in Dutch (in English this meant "leg of mutton"). By the 19th century the design had d into using tall triangular sails and jibs. They also used Bermuda cedar for the hulls which is much lighter than oak. This made the Bermuda sailboats very fast and easily maneuverable. They could travel into the wind with ease and were especially fast when heading downwind. Very soon they were being raced.
The name Marconi rig came from the 1899 America's Cup yacht race held in New York. Guglielmo Marconi demonstrated his new wireless radio by reporting on the race. The masts of the Bermudan rigged vessels with their supporting cables looked like the wireless mast of Marconi's radio. This is how they came to be named Marconi rigs.

Sago

Sago is a starch extracted from the spongy centre, or pith, of various tropical palm stems, especially that of "Metroxylon sagu". It is a major staple food for the lowland peoples of New Guinea and the Moluccas, where it is called "saksak", "rabia" and "sagu". The largest supply of sago comes from Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia. Large quantities of sago are sent to Europe and North America for cooking purposes. It is traditionally cooked and eaten in various forms, such as rolled into balls, mixed with boiling water to form a glue-like paste (papeda), or as a pancake. Sago is often produced commercially in the form of "pearls" (small rounded starch aggregates, partly gelatinized by heating). Sago pearls can be boiled with water or milk and sugar to make a sweet sago pudding. Sago pearls are similar in appearance as the pearled starches of other origin, e.g. cassava starch (tapioca) and potato starch, and they may be used interchangeably in some dishes.

Leg-of-mutton sail

A leg-of-mutton sail (LOM) is a simple triangular sail set on a long spar mounted horizontally on the mast. It runs in a fore-and-aft direction. The leg-of-mutton uses a spar mounted high instead of a boom. This gives the helmsman more visibility and there is no boom hit his or her head on. It is a favorite type of sail for small boats. These include puddle ducks and canoes. A LOM is very similar to a spritsail. But instead of being square or having four corners, the LOM has three. Instead of the spar being mounted diagonally, as with the spritsail, it is mounted horizontally.

<doc id="566562" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=566562" title="Four part writing">
Four part writing

The term four-part writing refers to the act of writing music in four-part chorale style. In this structure, the four main voices are referred to by their vocal counterparts: Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass.
For pedagogical purposes, part-writing practices of the composers can be codified into rules or guidelines. It is important to remember that while these guidelines are useful for studying music composition, they are not laws, and are often broken in modern writing. Below are the pedagogical guidelines for writing in four-part style.
On a chord-to-chord level, common-practice conventions dictate that lines should be smooth (by avoiding leaps and retaining common tones) and independent (by avoiding simultaneous movement of all voices in the same direction and parallel perfect intervals). Contrapuntal conventions likewise consider permitted or forbidden melodic intervals in individual parts, intervals between parts, the direction of the movement of the voices with respect to each other, etc. (See Counterpoint for more details on rules, especially in species counterpoint; see also Contrapuntal motion.) Whether dealing with counterpoint or harmony, these conventions emerge not only from a desire to create easy-to-sing parts but also from the constraints of tonal materials and from the objectives behind writing certain textures. In other words, the practical, technical, and aesthetic considerations surrounding voice leading reinforce one another.
Because triads only consist of three chord members, one of them must be doubled in four-part writing. As a general guideline, the tonic, subdominant, and dominant scale degrees may be doubled freely; and never double tendency tones such as the leading tone or 7th.

Ruth Plant

Ruth Plant (1912-1988) ARIBA, A.A. Dip. was a British architect who studied the painted churches in Eastern Europe and rock hewn churches in Ethiopia.
Ruth Isabella Churchill was born in Aberdeen on 15 September 1912, the daughter of British diplomat and artist historian, Sydney Churchill, and Dr Stella (née Myers) a psychologist, psychotherapist and politician.
She was educated at Notting Hill High School for Girls from 1924-30, then spent 6 months living in a flat opposite Adolf Hitler’s house in Munich while learning German, before studying at the Architectural Association School of Architecture from 1931-36, then practised as an architect.
After her marriage to Donald Craik ARIBA, A.A. Dip in May 1936 they spent 6 months driving across Europe to Hungary, Romania and Bukovina to record the painted churches that now are UNESCO World Heritage Sites after he had been awarded the Owen Jones Colour scholarship in 1935.
In 1939 with her husband and Antony Chitty she set up the London Institute of Design, which was moved to Bath at the outbreak of the war, and closed after her husband volunteered to join the RAFVR in 1940. After his death in March 1942 while serving as an RAFVR pilot, she married eminent soil agronomist Dr William Plant in 1944 with whom she had a son Stewart and a daughter Juliette, adding to sons David and Brian from her first marriage.
After the war she taught architecture in Bristol Architectural School, and undertook some private practice that included restoring her home Tickenham Court, Community halls, and updating the village church screens.
She studied the Painted Monasteries of Bukovina in pre-war Romania until her attention was turned to Ethiopia. In 1967 she travelled to Addis Ababa accompanying an old friend who was an acquaintance of Emperor Haile Selassie’s daughter Princess Tenagnework, and also to the northern Tigre Region as a guest of the Governor and his wife, Princess Aida Desta, daughter of Princess Tenagnework. This started her interest in Ethiopian rock churches which were then scarcely known to the world of scholarship and resulted in six trips between 1967 and 1974 covering over a 100 churches and in total nearly a year away from the UK. She travelled frugally caring little for her own comfort or safety, focusing on her intellectual pursuit. After the revolution in 1974 Princess Tenagnework and Princess Aida Desta were among the female members of the Royal Family who were imprisoned and Ruth was among a group who lobbied heavily to the Foreign Office and local pressure groups for their release.
She presented papers on research at international conferences and in 1985 published a book "Architecture of the Tigre, Ethiopia". For her research she was awarded an M. Lit. from Bristol University. 
In 1985 in failing health aged 73 and accompanied by her eldest son and daughter-in-law she visited Cappadocia, Turkey, to compare the rock churches/buildings with those she had seen in Ethiopia but found no similarity.

Otto studied the synthesis of hydrophilous gels. He wanted to find a perfect material that can be in permanent contact with living tissues. His colleague  helped him and together they prepared a gel. This gel absorbed up to 40% of water and was transparent. This new material is the Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate). They patented it in 1953. Wichterle thought that it might be a good material for contact lenses and gained his first patent for soft contact lenses. In 1957 Wichterle produced around 100 soft lenses. The problem was that the edges tore when the lense was getting removed. He wanted to find a better way to make them. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the beacuse of its Communist leadership in 1958. So the research at the Institute came to an end, but he did the important experiments to transform into a good shape of a contact lens by himself at home.
By late 1961 produced the first four hydrogel contact lenses on a home-made apparatus built from children's building kit (Merkur). All the glass tubing was also made by himself. On Christmas afternoon he finally made a contact lense in his apparatus. He tried the lenses in his own eyes. He said that they were comfortable. He built more new prototype machines using Merkur toys with stronger motor taken from his gramophone. With these devices he made 5,500 lenses.
Wichterle was well-known all around the world not only because of his achievements but also because of his activities in international organizations. He is the author of a large number of studies. He is the author or co-author of approximately 180 patents and of over 200 publications. 
In 1970, Wichterle was expelled again from his position in the institute, this time for signing "" . Full recognition did not come until the Velvet Revolution in 1989. In 1990, he was made president of the and was the honorary president of the  after that. Wichterle was a member of a number of foreign academies of science, he received many awards and honorary doctorates from several universities.
The asteroid number 3899 was named after Wichterle in 1993. A high school in Ostrava was named after him on September 1, 2006.

Peoria, Arizona

Peoria is a city in Maricopa and Yavapai counties in the US state of Arizona. Most of the city is in Maricopa County. The the northern part is in Yapavai County. It is a major suburb of Phoenix. It was named for Peoria, Illinois because that is where many of the early settlers came from.
In the 2010 United States Census, 154,065 people lived in the city. Peoria is the the ninth largest city in Arizona. Peoria has a Mayor–council government; a mayor and six councilmen who are all elected.
Small groups of hunter-gatherers called Paleo-Indians moved through what would later become Peoria. Spear points found in Peoria date from 10,000–8,000 BC and show there was hunting activity here. About 1500 BC, there was farming here which indicates that semi-nomadic peoples used the area. From about 1–500 AD the peoples here settled into two areas. There were crops being raised here in the Peoria area during the spring and summer. At other times they lived in the upland areas where they gathered seeds, cholla, and cactus fruits.
There is evidence that the Hohokam lived here before 1150 AD. They built their houses out of wattle and daub. Later they used adobe and stone. They vanished after about the mid-1400s. They left almost no clues as to where they went or what happened to their civilization.
As late as the 1870s, small bands of Yavapai were farming small pieces of land in the area depending on surface runoff and springs for water. 
European and American explorers discovered gold in 1863 near Wickenburg, Arizona. This caused a conflict with the Yavapai in the area. Ranchers were attracted to the area because of the grasslands for cattle. Relations with the Yavapai turned to war over the land. This was in part because the American Civil War caused the Army to leave the area. When the army returned, the Yavapai were eventually removed to a reservation. 
For about 13 years, the area around what would become Peoria lay vacant. In the late 1880s, four farming families moved to Peoria from Peoria, Illinois, naming the new town after the town they came from. From that time Peoria steadily grew as a farming community. Peoria incorporated in 1954. 
Lake Pleasant Regional Park is a large recreational area that is in Peoria. It serves the entire Phoenix area. Its main feature is the 10,000 acre (40 km² or 15.6 mi²) Lake Pleasant. It is an artificial reservoir that has campgrounds, boating and fishing. 
Peoria also is home the Peoria Sports Complex. It is the official spring training facility for the Seattle Mariners and the San Diego Padres. It has the Challenger Space Center and Canyon Raceway.

Apogamy (Ancient Greek αρο - "apo" = from, of + γάμος "gámos") – in botany – is defined as a replacement of normal sexual reproduction by asexual propagation, without fertilization. The fruits can be developed without fertilization. In this case, embryo occurs without fertilization or without the presence of pollen . A special form of apogamia is when the embryo develops klijavo seed. It is the phenomenon called parthenogenesis. So, fruits contain seeds, which although not fertilized, maintaining viability. In this case the embryo or germ arises from unfertilized oocyte. This phenomenon is widespread example in nuts. 
From such seeds develop plants whose features are identical properties of mothers from which the seed was taken.

A tithe, meaning a tenth-part, is money or agricultural products paid to a religious organization. A tithe can be seen as a a tax, a fee for a service or a voluntary contribution. Traditionally, a title is one-tenth of a person's income paid to the Church. Tithing came from the Book of Numbers. In ancient Israel, the tribe of Levi were the priests. The other tribes gave tithes to the tribe of Levi because they had been given no land in Canaan.
Under the Law of Moses a tenth part is given to the priests. Then, the priests were required to give a tenth part of what they received as an offering to God. These tithes were paid once a year.
In France, tithes were taxes levied by The Roman Catholic Church before the French Revolution. Tithes were levied on the Third Estate (common people), which made up about 98% of the French population. The Tithes were taxes for land owned by members of the Third Estate. The tithe was abolished after the creation of The New Constitution of France in 1791, when the Constitution was completed.

There is a pun in the title of the book. "Sláva" in Czech means "Fame". Slavic people regard themselves as "the people of fame", never "the slaves", as they are considered to be in the West.
The work is provided with a "Prolugue" ("Předzpěv"). This part is written in hexameter and pentameter. The metre is shaped like Greek one. It is based on lenght of vowels. 
<poem>
"Ai, zde leží zem ta, před okem mým selzy ronícím,"
"někdy kolébka, nyní národu mého rakev."
"Stoj noho! posvátná místa jsou, kamkoli kráčíš,"
"k obloze, Tatry synu, vznes se, vyvýše pohled." 
</poem>
The poem is divided into five parts. They are named after the rivers. The first part is named "Sála", the second "Labe, Rén, Veltava" and the third "Dunaj". These are the rivers, Slavic nations live around. Two next parts of the poem are named "Lethe" and "Acheron". These are the rivers know from Greek mythology. All the sonnets are written in decasyllable. It is trochaic pentameter. In his poem Kollár described the past of the Slavs, full of glory, and bright future for them.
<poem>
"A hundred times I spoke, but now I call" 
"To you divided, O Slavonians!" 
"Let's be a whole and not a part in clans;" 
"Be one in harmony or naught at all." 
"A dove-like nation we in scorn are styled." 
"But doves you know are come of such a stock" 
"That loves to live within a common flock," 
"And so may you apply this trait reviled." 
"O Slavs, thou race of many fragments!" 
"United forces e'er results will show," 
"But waste and dry the circling currents." 
"O Slavs, who are of many heads a race!" 
"The wise indeed a death no worse can know" 
"Than life that sloth, void, darkness doth embrace." 
"(Canto III, sonnet 62)"
</poem>
The poem is strongly influenced by Dante's "Divine Commedy". The last parts of Kollár's work are descriptions Slavic heaven and hell. Ján Kollár was a representative of the Panslavism ideology. He believed in union of all the Slavs. He opposed everything, he thought to destroy this union. He described Adam Mickiewicz, the greatest Polish poet, to be in hell. It was because Mickiewicz wrote poems about Polish people's fight against Russian tzar.

Mont Aigoual

Mont Aigoual () is a French mountain in the Cévennes, a southern part of the Massif Central in the Occitanie region. It is on the border of the Lozère and Gard departments and is the highest mountain of Gard.
When the sky is clear, it is possible to see the Mediterranean Sea, the Pyrenees, and also the Alps and Mont Blanc in particular.
The word "Aigoual" appears with different meanings: "ad stratam Aigoaldi" in 1228 refers to a route, "marcha Algoaldi" in 1238 names the limits of a territory, and "mons Aigoaldi" in 1249 is the name of the mountain. It seems that Aigoual comes from the word "Algwarld", the name of a person in the region.
Mont Aigoual has an elevation of and is the highest mountain in the Gard department and the second in the Lozère department and in the Cévennes mountains after Mont Lozère that is high. Mont Aigoual is within the "Cévennes National Park" ().
The summit of Mont Aigoual is on plateau with an altitude more than high and with an area of about in the "communes" Valleraugue (Gard) et Bassurels (Lozère). The watershed across the plateau divides the drainage basin in two: the Atlantic to the north and the Mediterranean to the south.
On its southern slopes is the source of the Hérault river, that flows to the south into the Mediterranean Sea.
The mountain is formed by granite from the Palaeozoic era.
On top of the mountain there is a meteorological station built in 1887. It is the last remaining weather station in France which is still inhabited by meteorologists. An exhibition on weather forecasting is open to visitors in the summer months.
Mont Aigoual has an oceanic climate (Cfc), bordering to a subartic (Dfc) (highland) climate.
A well-known hiking route is the "Climbing of the 4,000 steps" that begins in Valleraugue and ends in the weather station.
The ski station (a place where people go to practice skiing) of Prat Peyrot is on the sides of the Aigoual. It is the biggest ski station of the Cévennes.

The Allgäu Alps are a mountain range in the Northern Limestone Alps. They are located in Bavaria in Germany and Tyrol and Vorarlberg in Austria. The range is directly east of Lake Constance. 
There are relatively high levels of rain and it is the rainiest place in Germany. While there are some permanent snowfields, there are no glaciers. Most mountains have grassy faces on one side, and sheer cliffs on the other. Further south the mountains begin to look Dolomite, as they have crevices and gullies. The main river in the region is the Iller, which splits the mountains in half. The high peaks are all on the east of the Iller. On the west they are usually not taller than 2200m. Many activities occur in them, including hiking and skiing.
The highest peaks of the Allgäu Alps are either on Austrian soil or on the Austro-German border.

Euroscepticism

Euroscepticism is the criticism of the European Union (EU). Some observers also say that the total rejection of the EU is euroscepticism. Euroscepticism should not be confused with Anti-Europeanism, which is the dislike or fear of European culture and/or people.
Eurosceptics says that the European Union weakens the nation state. They also say that the European Union is too bureaucratic (meaning that important decisions are made by officials who aren't elected). In 2016, the countries with the most unfavourable view of the EU were Greece, France, Spain and the United Kingdom.
The rise of right-wing populist parties in Europe have been contributed to their Eurosceptic views. On 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union with 52% voting to leave.
In November 2015, a poll showed that those with a positive image of the EU went down from 52% in 2007 to 37%. Distrust of the EU was highest in Greece (81%), Cyprus (72%), Austria (65%), France (65%) Germany (63%), the United Kingdom (63%) and the Czech Republic (63%).

Tracer

Tracer is a fictional video game character. She first appeared in an update for the game "Heroes of the Storm". She later appeared in the 2016 video game, "Overwatch". These games are made by Blizzard Entertainment, a company that makes and publishes video games.
In "Overwatch", the character is known as Tracer, but her real name is Lena Oxton. Her personality is noticeably happy and energetic. She is known as one of the faster characters in the game, but also one with low health. In the game, she is able to teleport and time travel. 
In the real world, she is one of the more well known characters from "Overwatch". This is because she is seen on the cover of the video game and Blizzard has made animated videos featuring her.
Tracer was first seen in 2014 at Blizzard Entertainment's "BlizzCon 2014" event. The main designer on "Overwatch", Scott Mercer, said that Blizzard's canceled project, "Titan", had a character with Tracer's abilities. Jeff Kaplan was the main hero designer for "Overwatch"; he had a big part in Tracer's design. While the game was still being designed and tested, or its "beta" period, Tracer's health was lowered. 
Her personality was designed as heroic and happy. "Overwatch" game designer Michael Chu said, "the thing about Tracer is that she has a personality which is out of the norm for most people. She is incredibly optimistic, she is incredibly bubbly - it's part of her hero persona. We love her, I think she is very much one of the main characters of the game [...] [to] really carry the torch of what the game is all about: heroism." She is British and the British actress Cara Theobold voices her in the game.
While the game was still being designed, victory poses were added to the characters. Tracer's "Over the Shoulder" victory pose caused a controversy, because some players thought that the pose's focus on her physical features did not line up with her personality traits. Some players disagreed with this, finding nothing wrong with the pose, but Jeff Kaplan, the director of "Overwatch" apologized for the pose. Blizzard then changed the pose, and while some players were happy with the change, as well as with Blizzard listening to the game's community, other players thought that the game's makers were giving up their creative control to offended players.

Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P

Smith & Wesson M&P (Military and Police) is a series of handguns named after the famous 20th century Smith & Wesson service revolvers. They are designed mainly for military, police and personal defense use. They are offered in calibers including: .22 LR, .380 ACP, 9×19mm Parabellum, .357 Magnum and .45 ACP.
In 1852, gunsmiths Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson formed the partnership Smith & Wesson. After having financial troubles, in 1854 they sold the company to a shirt manufacturer named Oliver Winchester. In 1866, Winchester renamed the company Winchester Repeating Arms Company. That same year Smith and Wesson formed the second company called Smith & Wesson, which is still in operation.
In 1899, the company produced their now-famous Military & Police pistol. It was a double-action which set a standard for modern revolvers. It also introduced what has become a very popular caliber, the .38 S&W Special.
In 2005, the company introduced Smith & Wesson M&P model pistol. It was the first polymer handgun for S&W. It is available in 9mm and .40 S&W, and as of February 2016, in .45 ACP. It is recoil-operated and uses the Browning-type locking system.
In 2008 the name M&P expanded to became a series of handguns. It includes polymer pistols, (alloy) revolvers and AR-type rifles. The color, with a few exceptions, is usually black.
The M&P line has expanded to include the "Pro-series", "Shield-series" and "Bodyguard-series" guns.

Rudolf Slánský

Rudolf Salzmann Slánský (1901–1952) was a Czechoslovakian Communist politician. He was a longtime member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. Later he was the General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee (1945-1951). Slánský was one of the main organizers of the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état. During World War II he was a member of Czechoslovak exile resistance in the foreign centre in Moscow. Slánský was executed on December 3, 1952 at Prague’s Pankrac Prison.
Slánský was born on July 31, 1901 in Nezvěstice near Pilsen, Bohemia. His father was a Jewish merchant. He studied at a public academy in Plzeň. Slánský joined the Czechoslovakian Communist Party in 1921, three years after it was formed. In 1924 he was the editor of the Communist Party newspaper, "Rude Pravo". He rose in the ranks of the Party becoming a member of the Central Committee. He was in hiding from 1929 to 1935 because the Party was illegal in Czechoslovakia at the time. He became a member of the National Assembly and a close associate of Klement Gottwald.
When the Munich Agreement was signed in 1938, Czechoslovakia’s Sudetenland was taken over by Nazi Germany. When the German army marched into the Sudetenland on October 1, 1938, Slánský fled. He went to the Soviet Union and stayed there during most of World War II. He returned to Czechoslovakia in 1944 and took part in the Slovak National Uprising.
After the war, he was involved in politics. The Communist Party in Czechoslovakia agreed to accept many of Joseph Stalin's trained Czechs. Slánský was made the Secretary-General of the Party in Czechoslovakia. By 1948, it was clear that Gottwald was following the Stalinist style of politics. 
Slánský himself had been in charge of purges of several of his associates. When Gottwald thought he might be next, he had Slánský and 13 others arrested. The charges against Slánský included treason, spying and sabotage. Slánský finally confessed after being tortured. Then he had to memorize a speech for the show trial. All of the 14 had confessed. Slánský was one of the 11 who was given a death sentence. Twice Slánský attempted suicide while he was waiting for his execution. Finally, on December 3, 1952, he was hanged at Pankrac Prison.
After Stalin died in 1953, there were fewer purges. In April 1963, Slánský and his fellow victims were cleared of the charges against them. In May, 1968, Slánský and the others were formally exonerated.

Ferdinand Peroutka

Ferdinand Peroutka (6 February 1895 – 20 April 1978) was a Czech journalist and writer. He is considered to be one of the most important journalists in Czech history.
From 1919 to 1924 he worked as editor of magazine "Tribuna" (Tribune), then from 1924 to 1939 he was editor-in-chief of revue "Přítomnost" (Presence). His activity was supported by T. G. Masaryk, who also contributed to his magazines. Peroutka was also wrote about politics in "Lidové noviny," where he wrote against Nazis and communists, whose idelogies he saw as dangerous. For this he was frequently attacked by members of those parties. He also openly criticiced Adolf Hitler, for his lies and false promises. 
After German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939, Peroutka was forced to write propaganda for the Nazis. He didn't listen and in April 1939 issue of "Přítomnost" he wrote an article "Dynamický život" (Dynamic life) about the 50th birthday of Adolf Hitler. In this article he acknowledged Hitler's power, but refused that Czechs should listen to him. For this he was sent to concentration camp, but was released after few days. Although, a few months later in September 1939 he was jailed again, along with other potential enemies of Nazi regime.
Peroutka was jailed in concentration camps Dachau and Buchenwald, where he was liberated by American army in 1945.
After the war Peroutka became editor-in-chief of "Svobodné noviny" and "Dnešek," that replaced his previous magazines.
In those years he was repeatedly accused by communists of sympathizing with Nazis. Their proof were articles "Dynamický život" and "Hitler po lidské strance" (Hitler with a human face), that he didn't actually write. Peroutka refused those claims. Many years later in 2015, Czech president Miloš Zeman claimed that Peroutka was fascinated by Nazism and wrote an article called "Hitler je gentleman" (Hitler is gentleman). Although this was never proved Zeman refused to apologize and Ovčáček is still searching for that article
In the years 1945-1946 he was a member of the parliament for Czech National Social Party.
After Soviets assumed control over Czech government in 1948 Peroutka went to exile. First he went to England and later to United States. He worked for Radio Free Europe in Munich and was one of the members of The Council of Free Czechoslovakia.
Peroutka became one of the most important anti-communist personalities and his works were banned behind Iron Curtain. Reading and spreading his work was illegal and Communist government pretented he never existed. Because of this Czechs growing up after normalization had practically no way to find out who he was.
Peroutka died in 1978 in New York. After Velvet revolution he was buried on Vyšehrad in 1991.

Inauguration of Donald Trump

The inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States was held on Friday, January 20, 2017, on the West Front of the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.
The inauguration marked the beginning of the four-year term of Donald Trump as President and of Mike Pence as Vice President. The presidential oath of office was administered to Trump by Chief Justice John Roberts and the vice presidential oath of office was administered to Pence by Associate Justice Clarence Thomas.
Benedictions were given by several clerics (among them a rabbi and reverend Franklin Graham, son of the retired reverend Billy Graham, who for decades gave benedictions at the inauguration of US presidents).
Main theme in the auguration speech of President Trump was his focus on the interests of the United States ("America first!", "Make America Great Again").
The number of spectators was far less than at the inaugurations of his predecessor Barack Obama, although this was contested by President Trump and his spokesman. Hereby has to be pointed out that almost entire Washington D.C. voted for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, Trump's main opponent in the election.
Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, along with their respective wives, the First Ladies (including Hillary Clinton), had all confirmed their attendance at Trump's inauguration, and were all present. George H. W. Bush, age 92, did not attend the inauguration due to health reasons.
As of mid-December, there were 20 requests for demonstration permits for Donald J. Trump's inauguration, including Bikers for Trump, and the Women's March on Washington, scheduled for the day after inauguration day.

Gustav Frištenský was born in Kamhajek (now part of the village of Křečhoř). He had 3 brothers and 2 sisters. When he was child, he was small so nobody thought he could become famous sportsman. As teenager he started to lift weights and wrestle. He was learning to be a blacksmith but after suffering serious burns on his hand by a horseshoe, he left his craft. Frištenský went to Brno and he became a butcher in the butchery of Moritz Soffer. He trained in the gymnasium of the Hellas sports club. Soon, he left his job in butchery and started to focus on wrestling. In 1900, Frištenský participated in an international competition in Prague.

The following year he was the European champion. 
But Frištenský was still an amateur. After these achievements, he became a professional. He worked for the Kludský circus. Frištenský traveled around the world including the United States. Finally, he returned to his homeland. Frištenský married Miroslava Ellederová in Litovel. In 1917, he stayed in Litovel permanently. He and his wife built a house next to the Morava River. Frištenský traveled to the US again and wrestled in New York in front of an audience of 30,000. In 1921, Frištenský became the Czechoslovakia champion. In 1929, he became a professional European champion. During World War II, Frištenský joined the resistance movement. Soon, afterwards he became a prisoner of war and his wife had to bribe a Nazi prison commander to free him. After the war, in 1945, Frištenský left the Sport world and lived in Litovel. In 1947, he became a widower. In 1956, Frištenský received a title "Merited Master of Sports". He died on 6 April 1957.

Dzemijetul Hajrije

Dzemijetul Hajrije is the oldest Muslim organization in the United States. It is a benevolent society started in 1906 to help Muslim immigrants from Bosnia.
In the late 1800s, many young men came from Bosnia to Chicago to work in construction. They built roads, buildings, and tunnels for the Chicago commuter train system. Many Bosnians worked on the tunnels for Arif Dilich’s Paschen Construction Company, a large company in Chicago. The Dzemijetul Hajrije was like a family to the many young single men. It had religious services and special activities for Eid and other holidays. It helped pay for medical expenses and funerals.
Many Muslims also lived in Gary, Indiana and worked in the steel mills. Another group of Bosnian Muslims went to work in the copper mines in Butte, Montana. Dzemijetul Hajrije started chapters in Gary, Indiana in 1913, Wilpen, Pennyslvania in 1915, and Butte, Montana in 1916. They did not have a mosque, but they met in coffeehouses. In 1956 the last Bosnian coffeehouse closed.
After World War II more Bosnians immigrated to Chicago. Many were well-educated, but they had to take jobs as taxi cab drivers, factory workers, and janitors. In the early 1950s, they asked Sheik Kamil Avdich, a religious scholar, to be their first imam. They started the Muslim Religious and Cultural Home. In 1957, they opened a mosque on Halsted Street. In 1968, they changed their name to the Bosnian American Cultural Association. In the 1970s they bought land in Northbrook for a larger mosque, the Islamic Cultural Center of Greater Chicago.

Primogeniture

Primogeniture refers to the system of inheritance by the firstborn, usually the eldest son. In feudal England and other legal systems, the legitimate first-born son reserves the primary right to inherit property. He is given preference over all daughters, younger sons and even elder illegitimate sons. The rule is that the eldest will always have the first claim. If there is no son, each of the daughters inherit an equal share of the estate. In the absence of any children, the property is often inherited by the eldest brother. Among siblings, sons inherit before daughters and so on. Primogeniture is Latin for "first born".

Molecular machine

A molecular machine, or nanomachine, is any set of molecules which produce mechanical movements (output) in response to specific stimuli (input). The term is common in nanotechnology where a number of complex molecular machines have been proposed which might be a way of making a "molecular assembler". Molecular machines can be divided into two broad categories: synthetic and biological.
The 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Jean-Pierre Sauvage, Fraser Stoddart and Ben Feringa for the design and synthesis of molecular machines.
The most complex molecular machines are made of proteins, and found in cells. These include 'motor proteins'. Examples are: myosin, (which does muscle contraction), kinesin (which moves molecules from the nucleus along microtubules), and dynein (which produces the beating of motile cilia and flagella). These proteins are far more complex than any molecular machines that have yet been made by mankind.
Probably the most significant biological machine known is the ribosome. Other important examples include motile cilia: "In effect, the [motile cilium] is a nanomachine [of] over 600 proteins in molecular complexes, many of which also function independently as nanomachines".

Les Demoiselles d'Avignon

Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon) was a 1907 cubist painting by Picasso. It represents five women in a brothel. It took him nine months to paint it. Picasso gave up all attempts at traditional painting in this early cubist painting. He distorted the female figures in a way that showed the influence of African art. When the painting was shown in his studio to a group of painters and critics, they were outraged. Henri Matisse called it a hoax and an attempt to paint the fourth dimension, The art critic André Salmon wrote: "It was the ugliness of the faces that froze with horror the half-converted." Another painter, André Derain, wrote: "One day we shall find Pablo has hanged himself behind his great canvas." It has been called one of the most significant paintings of the 20th century. It is a original work. But it has never been fully accepted by the art world.

Nomen dubium

A nomen dubium is Latin for "doubtful name" (plural nomina dubia). It is a scientific name in zoology which is of unknown or doubtful use.
With a "nomen dubium" it may be impossible to decide whether a specimen belongs to that group or not. This may happen if the original type specimen is lost or destroyed. The zoological and botanical codes allow for a new type specimen, or neotype, to be chosen in this case.
A name may also be considered a "nomen dubium" if its name-bearing type is fragmentary or lacking important diagnostic features. This is often the case for species known only as fossils. To preserve stability of names, the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature allows a new type specimen, or neotype, to be chosen for a "nomen dubium" in this case.
It is one of a number of terms which are used in biological taxonomy.

Special Administrative Region

A Special Administrative Region (SAR) is a region in China that has a high level or sovereignty, or a lot of power to rule itself. There are 2 SAR's in China, Hong Kong and Macau. Unlike other regions in mainland China, SAR's have a constitution that is different from that of the People's Republic of China (PRC), Basic Law. Basic Law allows Hong Kong and Macau to have freedoms that are not in the rest of China, like freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, and freedom to petition. Basic Law also allows the SAR's to decide the economic rules of their region, which is why the economies are a lot less controlled in Hong Kong and Macau than in mainland China, as well as giving them the freedom to choose who to let into their own regions without needing a visa. As a result, Hong Kong and Macau have their own currencies, passports, official languages, etc. This is commonly known as the "one country, two systems" policy.
Chinese is an official language in both SAR's, but unlike mainland China where Mandarin is the main spoken language and simplified Chinese is the main written language, Cantonese is the most spoken language and traditional Chinese is the main written language in these areas. Interestingly enough, the vagueness of simply stating Chinese as the official language allows this to happen. Also, English and Portuguese, the main languages of the nations that controlled Hong Kong and Macau in the past in respective order, are also official languages in the respective SAR's.
After the British Empire defeated China in the Opium Wars, China was forced to give up Hong Kong to the British after signing unequal treaties that favored British interests. They had to give up control of Hong Kong Island in 1842, Kowloon Peninsula in 1860, and were made to lease New Territories for a period of 99 years in 1898. In the 1980s, when its lease of New Territories was nearly over, the United Kingdom sought to renew its lease of New Territories. However, China refused to renew the lease. Since New Territories had half of Hong Kong's people and most of its water supply, having Kowloon and Hong Kong Island without New Territories would have ruined Hong Kong's economy. Reluctantly, Britain decided in 1984 to begin talks on giving Hong Kong back in 1984. In 1988, China agreed to uphold Basic Law, which would make Hong Kong into an SAR when it gets returned to China, and in 1997, Hong Kong was returned to the PRC.
IN 1557, the Portuguese Empire made a permanent settlement on Macau, after being given permission from China to dock and trade there. However, it took over Taipa in 1951 and Coloane in 1864, and in 1887, China was forced to sign a treaty to make Macau a permanent colony of Portugal. However, after a military coup overthrew the Portuguese government in 1974, the new government made a promise to give back all the lands it took overseas. In 1986, Portugal and China began talks on how to bring control of Macau back to China peacefully, and in 1999, Macau became an SAR in the PRC.
As SAR's, China agrees that "commercial, social and legal life of Hong Kong/Macau will remain as it is" until after their first 50 years of being part of the PRC. For Hong Kong, its uninterrupted status will last until 2047, and for Macau, it will last until 2049. After then, the PRC is allowed to rule over Hong Kong and Macau as it pleases.

Table (landform)

A table (landform) is a high rock structure with a flat top. There are many different terms for this landform feature.
The tuya is a structure formed by a subglacial (under ice) volcano. Lava erupts underneath an overlying glacier or ice sheet. It melts through to the surface and pools, producing the flat plateau on top with near-vertical walls along the ice-contact margin as the lava cools and hardens. 
A similar landform is the tepui, which has a rather different origin. A body of hard rock resists erosion. It was originally inside a body of softer rock such as limestone, which got eroded away to form a plain. The more resistant rock is left behind as an isolated mountain. The term is used for the table-top mountains of South America. Auyán-tepui in the Guiana Highlands, Venezuela is the source of the Angel Falls, the tallest waterfall in the world. It is 19 times higher than Niagara Falls.
Table Mountain in South Africa is the best-known example.

Avraham Leib (Avrum) Burstein

Burstein was burn November 1971 in neighborhood, in .
He is married, a father of three boys and two girls, and a grandfather to a granddaughter.
His father, Chaim son of Rabbi Moshe Burstein the late, born in Pultusk, Poland, who immigrated to Israel in 1934, raised a family, which numbered during his lifetime nearly a thousand descendants in Israel and abroad, and was a co-founder of the Bratslav Hasidim synagogues in Jerusalem.
is mother, Bracha from the house of Mandel, was born in the village Patterson, NY- a neighborhood of Jewish immigrants who arrived from Germany on the eye of World War 2.
The families of Burstein and Mandel include creators and artists, among them the actors Pesach (Paul) Burstein and his son , and film director Barry Mendel.
At the age of 19, he married Miriam Rubinstein, the granddaughter of one of the influential Bratslav Hasidim, Rabbi Elazar Mordechai Rubinstein the late. Before the death of Rabbi Rubinstein, his Rabbi, Rabbi Eliezer Berland, ordered to document and record the grandfather who composed dozens of traditional tunes with emotion and revival in the Yiddish language, as well as melodies and prayer formulas he received from the Bratslav elders, and preserved them over the years. Burstein, on the advice of his Rabbi, fearing though the melodies become extinct, duplicated the recordings and distributed them to all of the Hasidim, melodies who became over the years the pantheon of the Bratslav Hasidim.
In 1990, young Burstein began to train youth who showed a musical talent of expressing Klezmer melodies, in order to continue the tradition of the original Klezmer music, as he received in a frontal way of means, from famous clarinet artists Dov Taras, and Gershon Kletzkin. The clarinet musicians and Nathan Coral, aged 16, who became hit musicians in the orthodox and national-religious sector during the 90's, started their training under Burstein's directing and with him, and together they producer albums with Klezmer and soul music, in order to preserve the melodies, their character and their heritage.
In 1992, he founded the youth groups "Karroubi HaNahal" in Jerusalem, for children and teenagers of the Bratslav Hasidim who came from other sectors, some of them boys to penitents' parents. In this framework, Burstein also made a point to bequeath to future generations the Jewish melody, by means of singing and music, among other activities on duty, some of them during outings with the youth to the countryside.
In 1993, for the first time in the history of the Bratslav Hasidim, Burstein records the songs and melodies of the Days of Awe of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, who passed through a tradition from the students of Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov, and been kept by the Bratslav Hasidim for about 200 years. For the recordings, Burstein provided Rabbi Shraga Levy, who serves since 1992 as a prayer leader (cantor) in the prayers of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur of the Bartslav Hasidim, in the kibbutz in Jerusalem and in Uman.
These recordings have become bestsellers and with a broad impact on the Bratslav Hasidim communities in Israel and abroad. They provide a way in which Hasidic people and the newly approaching to the religion could become familiar with the wording of the founder of the Bratslav Hasidim, Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov and , and their students in Poland and Ukraine in the 18 century.
In 1995, Burstein recorded and produced the first albums recorded on tape reels. The first album was called "Labadik" (cheerfulness, in Yiddish). The first tape passes a fresh and pulsating breeze of the traditional Klezmer, which did not receive representation in the Academy by means of musical notes or formal courses, but learned and purchased within a tradition passed down from father to son, and from Klezmer musicians to their students for centuries.
In 1997, he recorded the first album of the clarinetist Yechiel (Hilik) Frank, "Inside the Walls". That year, Frank married Burstein's sister, Sarah.
Over those years, Burstein brought together talented youth, and among their musical activities, they used to have a weekly, Saturday night "Melaveh Malkah" diner, with traditional songs and dances. This custom existed for 15 years in a row, since 1990 to 2006. From these frameworks emerged the future Klezmer artists, like the virtuoso player Nachman Zucker, the clarinet players David Golan and Abraham Balti, the violinist Shim'on (Shimi) Vaitzhlndr, the guitarist Nachman Driiar- also a second-generation of the Bratslav Hasidim.
The group that rallied around Burstein spent many hours training and publishing albums in the spirit of Klezmer and the Jewish melody, among them: "Midnight Amendment", "Dance", "the Jewish Melody", "Soul Melodies", "Braslav Hanukkah and Purim Songs", "Joyful Song of Rosh Hashanah", "Grace of the Lord" and more.
In 1993, Klezmer artists led by Burstein went to the Klezmer Festival in Zefat, among them clarinetist Gershon Kletzkin and Rabbi Shmuel Stern, who later wrote books about the relationship between the Jewish tune and the worship of God according to the Hasidic thought and the Kabbalah. At that time, the Jerusalem Klezmer musicians began to expand their performances and leave to appear on stages abroad. Those performances stood out in their unique style, in which young Hasidic men played and danced decorated in wigs, caps and tassels, to Jewish and non-Jewish locals alike. Among the outstanding performances in those years, were performances in Krakow, Poland and in Barcelona, Spain, where the local audiences was first introduced to the authentic tune of the Members of the Old settlement in Jerusalem.
In 2001, Burstein won the musical competition held in the television program "Made in Israel" on the state broadcaster, where they climbed to the top and received a first place award.
The "main Joy" of the tens of thousands in the town of Uman, near the grave of Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, is a tradition that was organized half a century ago, since the fall of the Soviet Union. Burstein founded this tradition, with an emphasis on klezmer and traditionally Hasidic melody, while making sure that no modern melody will ever be played atop that stage.
At Lag B'Omer, the Jewish largest day of celebration of the author of the book "Zohar", Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, at mount "Meron", which thousands of people celebrate each year, the main stage is led throughout the day by Burstein's students and the graduates' of "the Klezmer Association".
In 1999, Burstein founded the center for Jewish music "Judaism and singing", in the bohemian street "Sheinkin" in Tel Aviv. Spontaneous concerts of Jewish music took place there, and every Thursday, a "Kabbalat Shabbat" took place, led by the singer and songwriter Yitzhak Fox.
In 2005, Burstein founded the "Jerusalem Klezmer Association".
In 2007, Burstein founded the "Klezmer on Foot" parade, a parade of Klezmer musicians and dancers, which takes place during Passover and sukkot, starting at Yemin Moshe neighborhood, via Hutsot HaYotser and around the walls of Old Jerusalem to the tomb of King David on Mount Zion- a symbolic finish to the one considered the generator of Jewish poetry. The parade includes the maestro Giora Feidman, Hilik Frank and the rest of the graduates and students of Burstein, joined by musicians and dancers from other frameworks. Townspeople, tourists and lovers of Klezmer from all circles and communities join this parade.
In 2008, Burstein expends the annual performances and establishes the first Klezmer Festival in Jerusalem, attended be esteemed musicians in the genre, such as Moshe (Musa) Berlin, Hilik Frank, Urit Orbach from the band "Women of Eve", Mirel Reznik. The festival puts emphasis on the fact that the rest of the festivals called "Klezmer" abandoned the authentic Klezmer in favor of art from other styles. Burstein also makes sure to bring to the light the fact that Jerusalem is the capital of klezmer, in the historical aspect and through the fact that more than 50 klezmer artists live and are active in the city and its suburbs.
The same year he publishes the booklet "Klezmer Soul" that contains the musical notes and explanations of dozens of Klezmer melodies and stories of the Jewish town, accompanied by photos of the klezmer past and present. The booklet is distributed in six languages: Hebrew, Yiddish, English, German, French and Russian.
Since 2010, Burstein puts on a weekly occurrence, the "Klezmer Tish": a "Melaveh Malkah" show, that takes place in Jerusalem's "Hkrtz'ma of Burstein" (the basement of the former library, "Yung Yiddish"), founded by Mendy Cahan, who occasionally comes to perform there.
Since 2009, each year during the Days of Awe between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, Burstein and his graduates, the klezmer musicians, travel to cities in Europe, and in this framework they play music, present and bring to the stage the culture of the Jewish shtetl (Jewish town), the Jewish prayers and Klezmer. Performances in the overseas communities receive a broad documentation in the local media and is very popular, even among local nations.
Burstein, also known at his performing and acting skills, among them plays in practice to the stories of "Shalom Aleichem", was chosen by the producers of the educational series "KiKa" In Germany to a leading role, along with some of his students. The series, "Search of God", part of which was filmed in Jerusalem, documents searching for God in three the world's major religions (Islam, Christianity and Judaism).
In 2011, Burstein and some of his graduates were chosen to play in key roles in the first place winning series "Shtisl" from "Hot". In other episodes, they are used as escorting musicians.
In the same year, "the Klezmer Association" won the second place prize in the nationwide Klezmer contest in Israel on behalf of the Tel Aviv municipality.
In 2013, Burstein and his students are chosen as "the commendable of the cultural basket", following the show "The Story of Klezmer" that was written by Ofer Schneider, who is a music teacher from the Ministry of Education and advocates for the enrichment of musical knowledge of the artists association.
In 2014, Burstein founded the "Klezmer Annual Conference", in the collage "Emuna" in Jerusalem, attended by clarinet musicians Giora Feidman, Musa Berlin, Hilik Frank, Hanan Bar Sela, Urit Orbach and more. In 2015, the second conference took place in a larger format in the Hall of Solomon in Jerusalem.
At Hanukkah 2014, Burstein gets the responsibility for the musical and visual accompaniment at the International Bible Contest for Adults on behalf of the Ministry of Education, with the participation of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Deputy Minister of Education Avi Wortzman. After the Chanukah candle lighting, Burstein preformed the song "If I Were a Rich Man" from the play "Tevye" written by the Jewish writer Shalom Aleichem - a play that relates the biblical Jewish heritage and Jewish life in exile.
On this occasion, Burstein and his students gave the decoration of "the Darling of the Jerusalem Klezmer" to the Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara. The Prime Minister promised to promote the status of Jerusalem as the capital of the klezmer world.

Muhajir (Pakistan)

Mohajirs constitute about 8 percent of the population. They are Muslims who settled in Pakistan after the partition of British India in 1947. Unlike other cultural groups of Pakistan, they do not have a tribe-based cultural identity. They are the only people in the country for whom Urdu, the official language, is their native tongue. Mohajirs were the vanguard of the Pakistan Movement, which advocated the partition of British India in order to create the independent nation of Pakistan for Indian Muslims.

P53

p53 (or "tp53") is a gene vital to many forms of life, including humans. It codes for a protein which suppresses cancer. It has been called "the guardian of the genome". 
The "p53" gene is the most frequently mutated gene (>50%) in human cancer. Its protein product binds to DNA and regulates gene expression to prevent mutations of the genome.
"p53" protein (TP53) is at low levels in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). This allows the most important cell division to proceed rapidly.

Absolutely disgusted with all the incredibly aggressive allegations. Article deleted several times, although a lot of references and content totally support this notable person's article. Can't believe how unfair the deletion criteria are. There are countless 2-line paragraph articles with absolutely no notability or relevance whatsoever, that keep being on the site. Hard to tell why, unless you admit a total unfairness is applied. 
Please, tell me why, for example, the article Luis Di Giglio in the English version of Wikipedia, among million others is still there; he's a cricketer, "just" that; Saverio, other than being a cricketer himself, he's notable in a lot more fields; so tell me, instead of sending links and stuff like that, why would a much less notable person should be on Wikipedia and a person with far more experience in difference fields should get deleted?!

Nematocera

The Nematocera are a large suborder of flies which include the mosquitoes and midges. They usually have long thin bodies, with segmented antennae. Usually their larvae are aquatic, but there are many exceptions to this.
Examples of the Nematocera include the mosquitoes (Culicidae), crane flies (Tipulidae) and black flies (Simuliidae). Many of the other families are called gnats, and others are called midges.
Many species form mating swarms of males, and in some of these, competition for females is extreme. Although many species (as larvae) have a strong association with water, even within a single family there may be a trend toward semiaquatic and terrestrial habitats.

Smith &amp; Wesson

Smith & Wesson (S&W) is an American firearms manufacturing company. Their headquarters are in Springfield, Massachusetts. The company was founded in 1852. Smith & Wesson's pistols and revolvers have become standard issue to police and military forces. Smith & Wesson firearms are very popular among sport shooters.
Smith & Wesson is also known for the many types of ammunition it has introduced over the years. Many cartridge calibers bear the S&W name. For example, the .500 S&W Magnum.
Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson founded the Smith & Wesson Company in 1852. The purpose was to develop a lever action pistol. But by 1854 the company was failing. They sold the company to a shirt manufacturer named Oliver Winchester. In 1866, Winchester renamed the company Winchester Repeating Arms Company. That same year Smith and Wesson formed the second company called Smith & Wesson. Their timing was right. Not long after they built their new factory in Springfield, the American Civil War started. 
One of the most popular pistols during the war was the Smith & Wesson Model 2. Many Civil War soldiers purchased the No 2 revolver privately. Between 1861 and 1874, over 77,000 were produced. Smith & Wesson became so profitable that the two partners were the wealthiest men in Springfield by 1865.
One of the most popular calibers during the Civil War was the .44 caliber. The partners realized they needed to produce a pistol in this caliber. By 1870 S&W introduced the .44 metallic cartridge which was a major improvement over the .44 percussion cap models used in the war. To use this new cartridge, the company introduced a larger pistol known as the Smith & Wesson Model 3. It featured rapid loading and reloading. The gun was a personal favorite of Wyatt Earp. In 1875, at age 65, Smith sold his share of the company to Wesson. He still advised his former partner in business matters.
In 1880 S&W introduced the first double-action revolver. It was designed to use the .32 S&W caliber cartridge. By this time Wesson's three sons, Walter H., Frank L., and Joseph H., were active in the company. In 1887, Frank L. Wesson died but his brothers continued as partners in the company. 
In 1887 a new concealed hammer design for police was made. Variations of this design are still being made. In 1899, S&W brought out its most famous design, the Military & Police pistol. It was a double-action which set a standard for modern revolvers. It also introduced what has become a very popular caliber, the .38 S&W Special. It is still one of the most popular revolver cartridges ever produced. Large numbers of S&W .38 special handguns were sold to police and military worldwide. They were used in both World War I and World War II. They remained popular until they were finally replaced by many police and military organizations by Semi-automatic pistols.
In 1904, Daniel B. Wesson died. But without his guidance the two sons could not agree on the future direction of the company. This period of weak leadership continued for some time. In 1908 the company introduced a new line of .44 caliber pistols called the .44 New Century, but was soon renamed the Smith & Wesson Triple Lock. It used a new cartridge developed by S&W, the .44 Special.
Smith & Wesson received large government contracts for military revolvers from the American government. The company expanded to produce the firearms. But management problems, labor disputes and a new workforce all caused problems for production. As a result, the US government stepped in to manage S&W until the end of the war.
After the war a surplus of military arms and imports of low cost guns caused sales to drop. Under Harold Wesson, the company manufactured other items to try to keep up profits. They made sewing machines, handcuffs, washing machines and toilet parts. But none of these items made the company profitable.
About this time, bullet-proof vests came into use. Gangsters quickly adopted them so that bullets traveling at under 1,000 fps would not penetrate them. S&W immediately began experimenting with improved bullets. They also used the famous firearms expert Bill Jordan as a consultant to help develop a new much more powerful handgun. What resulted was the first magnum cartridge, the S&W .357 Magnum. In 1935 they released the Smith & Wesson Model 19. Using a 125 grain bullet traveling at 1600 fps, it could easily defeat the body armor of the time.
By the start of the war S&W was nearly bankrupt. The company was now run by Carl R. Hellstrom. Under his management the company concentrated its efforts on handguns and the company began to expand. In 1965 the Wesson family sold the company to the Bangor Punta corporation. The company began producing firearms accessories as well as firearms. In 1884, S&W was sold to Lear Siegler who, in 1986, was acquired by Forstmann Little & Company. Forstmann & Little was mainly interested in Siegler's aerospace and automotive lines. So they sold Smith & Wesson to Tomkins plc, a British holding company. Under Tomkins, S&W developed a number of semiautomatic pistols. This included several using the new .40 S&W cartridge. During this time handgun sales declined. Because of anti-gun lawsuits, operating costs began to rise.
On March 17, 2000, Smith & Wesson made an agreement with US President Bill Clinton. It agreed to make changes in the design and distribution of its firearms. This was in return for "preferred buying program" to offset the loss of revenue as a result of anticipated boycott. All authorized S&W dealers and distributors had to follow a “code of conduct” to eliminate the sale of firearms to prohibited persons. Dealers had to agree to not allow children under 18 access to gun shops or sections of stores that contained firearms.
After an organized campaign by the NRA and NSSF, thousands of retailers and tens of thousands of firearms consumers boycotted Smith & Wesson.
On 11 May 2001, Saf-T-Hammer Corporation acquired Smith & Wesson from Tomkins plc for $15 million USD. This was a fraction of the $112 million originally paid by Tomkins. The Smith & Wesson purchase was chiefly brokered by Saf-T-Hammer President Bob Scott. He had left Smith & Wesson in 1999 because of a disagreement with Tomkins’ policies. After the purchase, Scott became the president of Smith & Wesson. He guided the 157-year-old company back to its former standing in the market.
On 15 February 2002, the name was changed to Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation.
In December 2014, Smith & Wesson Holding announced it was paying $130.5 million for Battenfeld Technologies. This is a Columbia, Missouri-based designer and distributor of hunting and shooting accessories. This was part of a plan to merge all its existing Smith & Wesson, M&P and Thompson Center Arms accessories into a single division.
In August 2016 the company bought Crimson Trace, a laser-sight manufacturer, for $95 million. They bought Taylor Brands, a tool and knife maker, for $85 million. In November 2016 the company bought UST Brands, a survival equipment maker, for $32.3 million. On November 7, 2016, Smith & Wesson announced that it would be changing the name of its holding company to American Outdoor Brands Corporation.

To cover the loss on his previous projects he imposed land tax in Doab area at 50% of the produce. The peasants who were already suffering due to a widespread famine, were stunned by the order.

According to her legend, she was supposed to have tortured and killed over 650 servant girls. It also claimed she bathed in human blood. That, after hearing of all the deaths and tortures going on in her castle, the countess and her servants were put on trial. Her servants were said to have been executed.

Filostrato (poem)

Filostrato is a poem by 14th-century Italian poet Giovanni Boccaccio. It tells about Troilo's love for Criseyda. The historical importance comes from two reasons. One reason is that it is one of the first long poems written in ottava rima. The second is that it was a source for Geoffrey Chaucer's "Troilus and Criseyde". Ottava rima is a strophe built of eight lines and rhymed abababcc.
Boccaccio's poem was based on "Roman de Troie" by Benôit de Sainte Maure, "Historia troiana" by Guido delle Colonne, a similar story by Binduccio dello Scelto and "Historia Troiae" by Filippo Ceppi.
