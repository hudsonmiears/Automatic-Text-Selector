Bijective function

In mathematics, a bijective function or bijection is a function "f" : "A" → "B" that is both an injection and a surjection. This means: for every element "b" in the codomain "B" there is exactly one element "a" in the domain "A" such that "f"("a")="b". Another name for bijection is 1-1 correspondence.
The term "bijection" and the related terms "surjection" and "injection" were introduced by Nicholas Bourbaki. In the 1930s, he and a group of other mathematicians published a series of books on modern advanced mathematics.
Formally:
The element formula_5 is called the image of the element formula_6. 
The element formula_6 is called a pre-image of the element formula_5. 
Note: Surjection means minimum one pre-image. Injection means maximum one pre-image. So bijection means exactly one pre-image.
Cardinality is the "number" of elements in a set. The cardinality of "A"={X,Y,Z,W} is 4. We write #"A"=4. 
Formally:
Let "f" : "A" → "B" be a bijection. The inverse function "g" : "B" → "A" is defined by if "f"("a")="b", then "g"("b")="a". (See also Inverse function.) 
Note: The notation for the inverse function of "f" is confusing. Namely,
Let "f"("x"):ℝ→ℝ be a real-valued function "y"="f"("x") of a real-valued argument "x". (This means both the input and output are numbers.)
Example: The linear function of a slanted line is a bijection. That is, "y"="ax"+"b" where "a"≠0 is a bijection.
Example: The polynomial function of third degree: "f"("x")="x" is a bijection. Image 2 and image 5 thin yellow curve. Its inverse is the cube root function "f"("x")= ∛"x" and it is also a bijection "f"("x"):ℝ→ℝ. Image 5: thick green curve.
Example: The quadratic function "f"("x") = "x" is not a bijection (from ℝ→ℝ). Image 3. It is not a surjection. It is not an injection. However, we can restrict both its domain and codomain to the set of non-negative numbers (0,+∞) to get an (invertible) bijection (see examples below).
Example: Suppose our function "machine" is "f"("x")="x"². 
Let "f"("x"):"A"→"B" where "A" and "B" are subsets of ℝ.
Example: The quadratic function defined on the restricted domain and codomain [0,+∞)
is a bijection. Image 6: thin yellow curve.
Example: The square root function defined on the restricted domain and codomain [0,+∞) 
is the bijection defined as the inverse function of the quadratic function: "x". Image 6: thick green curve.
is a bijection. Image 4: thin yellow curve ("a"=10).
Example: The logarithmic function base "a" defined on the restricted domain (0,+∞) and the codomain ℝ
is the bijection defined as the inverse function of the exponential function: "a". Image 4: thick green curve ("a"=10).

Historical linguistics

Historical linguistics is the study of language change. It has five main concerns:
Modern historical linguistics dates from the late 18th century. It grew out of the earlier discipline of philology, the study of ancient texts and documents dating back to antiquity.
At first, historical linguistics was comparative linguistics. The focus was on the well-known Indo-European languages, many of which had long written histories. Scholars also studied the Uralic languages, another European language family for which less early written material exists. 
Since then, there has been linguistic work outside of European languages, such as on the Austronesian languages and various families of Native American languages. 
Comparative linguistics is now part of a discipline of historical linguistics. For the Indo-European languages, comparative study is now a well-developed field. Most research is being carried out on the later development of these languages, such as the development of the modern standard varieties.
Some scholars have done studies attempting to establish super-families. They have, for example, linked Indo-European, Uralic, and other families into Nostratic. These attempts have not been accepted widely. The information needed to establish relatedness becomes thinner the further back in time we go. The time-depth of linguistic methods is limited due to chance word resemblances and variations between language groups. Back to around 10,000 years scholars can trace language changes. The dating of the various proto-languages is also difficult; several methods are available for dating, but only approximate results can be got.

<doc id="441573" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=441573" title="Nostratic">
Nostratic

Nostratic is a hypothetical language family which includes many of the present-day language families of Eurasia. The idea is that Nostratic was spoken after the ice sheets melted, but before people spread out throughout Europe and Asia.
Many of today's languages are descendants of Nostratic, so it is thought. These include the Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic and Kartvelian languages. Usually also included are the Afroasiatic languages native to North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the Near East, and the Dravidian languages of the Indian subcontinent. 
The name "Nostratic" is derived from the Latin "nostrates" "fellow countrymen". The idea was expanded in the 1960s by Soviet linguists, called the "Moscovite school" by Bomhard. It has received renewed attention in English-speaking academia since the 1990s.
The hypothesis is controversial and has varying degrees of acceptance amongst linguists worldwide. Some linguists take an agnostic view.

The operation is between two fractions, therefore the way these fractions are represented influence the mediant. For example, the mediant of 1/1 and 1/2 is 2/3, but the mediant of 2/2 and 1/2 is 3/4, even though the sum of both is 3/2.

Eye contact

Eye contact occurs when "two people look at each other's eyes at the same time".
Eye contact is a form of nonverbal communication. It is a meaningful sign of social communication, but exactly what it means depends on the situation. The customs and significance of eye contact vary widely between cultures, with religious and social differences often altering its meaning greatly.
Eye contact and facial expressions give social and emotional information. People, perhaps without consciously doing so, probe each other's eyes and faces for positive or negative mood signs. Sometimes, the meeting of eyes arouses strong emotions.
Eye contact is also an important element in flirting, where it may serve to establish and gauge the other's interest in some situations.
In traditional societies, the role of women is usually very different from men. So, women lower their eyes, and do not to look directly at a man's face. Lustful glances at the opposite sex, young or adult, are forbidden. 
Another social difference is that of status. Japanese children are taught in school to direct their gaze at the region of their teacher's Adam's apple or tie knot. As adults, Japanese lower their eyes when speaking to a superior as a gesture of respect.
In many cultures, such as East Asia and Nigeria, it is respectful not to look the dominant person in the eye, but in Western culture this can be interpreted as being "shifty-eyed", or untrustworthy.

Parliamentary republic

A parliamentary republic is a name for a government (system of managing people). The system is used in many countries.
In a parliamentary system, the legislature is the part of government that makes laws. The legislature also gives power to the executive (the part of government that enforces laws). This is the basic form of a parliamentary republic. The difference is how the legislature gets its power. The legislature is not chosen by a ruler or by birth. The people choose the legislature in an election. This means that the executive gets its power from the legislature, and the legislature gets its power from the people.
The people choose the legislature. There are many people in the legislature. That group then gets together to choose one person to be their leader. The leader is often part of the legislature. The name for this job is Prime Minister in most countries. The Prime Minister is the head of government. This person leads the country. This way, the people are the power behind the parliamentary republic. They choose the units that make government work.
This is different from other parliamentary systems because the legislature is chosen in a different way. In other parliamentary systems, members are chosen by the head of state, the local leaders, or by birth. In a parliamentary republic, the people choose the members. The people do this through elections. Sometimes they vote for every person in parliament. Other times they vote for people in their area. The politicians they elect go to parliament to make laws and select the head of state. This gives the people power to decide who is in government.

Deepika Padukone

Deepika Padukone (; born 5 January 1986) is a Danish–born Indian movie actress and model. One of the most popular and highest-paid Indian celebrities, she has established a career in Bollywood films, and is the recipient of two Filmfare Awards.
Deepika Padukone was born on 5 January 1986 in Copenhagen,Denmark to Konkani-speaking parents. Her father, Prakash, is a former badminton player of international repute, and her mother, Ujjala, is a travel agent. Her younger sister, Anisha, is a golfer. Her paternal grandfather, Ramesh, was a secretary of the Mysore Badminton Association. The family relocated to Bangalore, India, when Padukone was a year old. She was educated at Bangalore's Sophia High School, and completed her pre-university education at Mount Carmel College. She subsequently enrolled at the Indira Gandhi National Open University for a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology, but later quit it due to scheduling conflicts with her modelling career.
Padukone's first screen appearance was in Himesh Reshammiya's music video "Naam Hai Tera" in 2005. Padukone made her film debut by playing the titular protagonist in the Kannada film "Aishwarya" (2006). Her first Hindi film release came the following year with Farah Khan's melodrama "Om Shanti Om", in which she played dual roles opposite Shah Rukh Khan. For her performance, she won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut and also received a Best Actress nomination at the same ceremony. Her sole film role in 2008 was as one of Ranbir Kapoor's love interests in "Bachna Ae Haseeno".
Padukone's first film release of 2009, the kung fu comedy "Chandni Chowk to China" opposite Akshay Kumar, proved to be a box office flop. However, her next release, Imtiaz Ali's romance "Love Aaj Kal" grossed worldwide, and garnered her a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. Padukone had five film releases in 2010. The comedy "Housefull" was a commercial success, though her other four releases that year failed at the box office. The series of poorly received films continued with both her 2011 releases, the drama "Aarakshan" and the comedy "Desi Boyz".
The role of an impulsive party-girl in Homi Adajania's "Cocktail" (2012) proved to be a breakthrough for Padukone. Critics praised her performance and she received several acting nominations for it. The year 2013 was key for Padukone; three of her four releases that year earned over in India. Among these were two of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all timethe romantic comedy "Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani" and the action-comedy "Chennai Express". She also won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for portraying Leela, a character based on Juliet, in "Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela" (2013). In 2014, Padukone appeared in "Kochadaiiyaan", an animation film in Tamil, which was shot using motion capture technology. Also that year, she played a young widow in Adajania's "Finding Fanny" and a bar dancer in the ensemble heist film "Happy New Year". The following year, Padukone starred alongside Amitabh Bachchan and Irrfan Khan in Shoojit Sircar's critically acclaimed comedy-drama "Piku" (2015).

Jeremy Thorpe

John Jeremy Thorpe (29 April 1929 – 4 December 2014) was a British Liberal politician. 
Thorpe was born in South Kensington, London, the son of former Conservative Member of Parliament John Henry Thorpe. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Oxford. He was the MP for North Devon from 1959 until 1979. He was leader of his party from 1967 until 1976.
In 1979 at the Central Criminal Court in London, Thorpe was acquitted of conspiracy to murder model Norman Scott.
In 1961, Norman Scott (b. 12 February 1940), a former model, met Thorpe while working as a stable lad. He claimed that he and Thorpe had a sexual relationship between 1961 and 1963, when homosexual acts were illegal in Britain. 
Enquiries led to Thorpe and three others being charged with conspiracy to murder Scott. During the investigation, an antique firearms collector, Dennis Meighan, confessed he had been hired by a representative of a person called "a Mr Big in the Liberal Party" to kill Scott for £13,500. Meighan later claimed that his 1975 oral confession was significantly shortened when it was offered to him for signing: "I read the statement, which did me no end of favours, but it did Jeremy Thorpe no end of favours as well, because it left him completely out of it..." 
The judge's summing-up was widely criticised for its bias, and it made headlines when he described Scott as "a crook, an accomplished liar ... a fraud". The four defendants were all acquitted on 22 June 1979. Dennis Meighan was never called to give evidence and remained silent until 2014, when he acknowledged his involvement and commented: "It was a cover-up, no question, but it suited me fine".
The Scott Affair ruined Thorpe, who resigned as leader of the Liberal Party, and was defeated at the next general election in 1979.
Thorpe was married to Caroline Allpass from 1968 until she was killed in a car crash in 1970. The couple's son was born in 1969. Thorpe was married to pianist Marion Stein (1926-2014) from 1973 until her death. Thorpe was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He died from the disease in London on 4 December 2014, aged 85.

Shraddha Kapoor (born March 3, 1989) is an Indian actress who appears in Hindi movies of Bollywood. Through her movie career, she has become one of Bollywood's famous actresses and one of the most popular celebrities in India. She began her acting career in the 2010 movie "Teen Patti" for which she earned a nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut category. 
Then, she followed it with her first leading role in the teen drama "Luv Ka The End" (2011) in which she won the Stardust award for Best Actress for her role. In 2013, she received appreciation for her performance in the romantic drama "Aashiqui 2", her first successful movie, which earned her a Filmfare Award for Best Actress nomination, among others. Besides acting in movies, Kapoor is active in humanitarian work and is a celebrity endorser for several brands.
Kapoor was born on March 3, 1989 in Mumbai. She is the daughter of actors Shakti Kapoor and Shivangi Kolhapure Kapoor. She is the sister of actor Siddhanth Kapoor, niece of actresses Padmini and Tejaswini Kolhapure and grandniece of singers Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle and Usha Mangeshkar. On her father's side, Kapoor is of Punjabi descent, and on her mother's side, she is of Marathi ancestry. Like her mother, she has stated that she is a complete Marathi.

Kapoor debuted in the 2010 movie "Teen Patti" alongside Amitabh Bachchan and Ben Kingsley. She played the role of a studious geek, who obeys her professor to gamble in cards, which later proved to be her biggest mistake of her life. Despite, the movie failed to do well at the box office Kapoor had been able to receive appreciation and a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut for her performance.
After her debut, she signed a three-movie deal with Yash Raj Films and featured in their 2011 teen comedy "Luv Ka The End" with Taaha Shah. Kapoor played the lead role of a college student who plots against her boyfriend after he betrays her. The movie underperformed at the box office and gained mixed reviews from critics. However, her performance received appreciation and the Stardust Award for Best Actress.
Later she was offered the lead role in "Aurangzeb" as a part of her deal with Yash Raj. But she went on to sign Mahesh Bhatt's "Aashiqui 2" instead, thereby cancelling the three-movie contract with Yash Raj Films.
In 2013, Kapoor appeared in the romantic musical drama "Aashiqui 2", the sequel to the 1990 classic "Aashiqui". Her character, Aarohi Keshav Shirke, is a small-town bar singer who becomes a successful playback artist with the help of a singing superstar Rahul Jaykar (Aditya Roy Kapur). The movie was a major box office success with a global revenue of 1.09 billion and was credited as a "blockbuster" by Box Office India. Kapoor earned praises and rose to fame for her role. She received several nominations in the Best Actress category, including one at the Filmfare awards.
That year, she also appeared in a supporting role for the romantic comedy movie "Gori Tere Pyaar Mein", playing the fiancée of Sriram Venkat (played by Imran Khan). Kapoor is simultaneously filming for two projects Ekta Kapoor's production "The Villain "where she will feature opposite Sidharth Malhotra, and Vishal Bhardwaj's adaptation of William Shakespeare's "Hamlet" titled "Haider", with Shahid Kapoor, Irrfan Khan and Tabu. In 2014, she was confirmed to play the lead role in the sequel of 3D dance movie "ABCD (Any Body Can Dance) "alongside Varun Dhawan, Prabhu Deva and Remo D'souza.
Kapoor's off-screen life is the subject of widespread coverage in India. She is known in the Indian media for being publicly outspoken and assertive. She is recognised for her contributions to the movie industry through her fashion style and movie roles.
In addition to acting in movies, Kapoor has supported charitable organisations and performed for stage shows. In 2011, she walked the ramps of Lakme Fashion Week and India International Jewellery Week. In late 2013, she performed in a fund raising event organized by STAR India.
She is the brand ambassador of several products including Lakmé, Wella, Vaseline, Gitanjali and Titan. In late 2013, a poll conducted by FHM ranked Kapoor #5 on ″100 Sexiest Women In The World 2013″.

Utatsusaurus

Utatsusaurus is the earliest-known form of an ichthyopterygian. It lived in the earliest Lower Triassic period, about 250245 millions years ago. It is nearly 3m (about 9 feet) long with a slender body. 
The name "Utatsusaurus" was given after the city Utatsu-cho where the first specimen was found. The fossils have been found in the Lower Triassic of Miyagi Prefecture, Japan and British Columbia, Canada.
"Utatsusaurus" is one of the most primitive (basal) types of ichthyosaur. It has transitional features between its ancestral land-dwelling forms and the more derived ichthyosaurs. Unlike the more advanced ichthyosaurs, "Utatsusaurus" has no dorsal fin and has a broad skull. The snout gently tapers, compared to the more rounded one of more derived ichthyopterygians. The tail had a long low fin, quite different from the tail shape of later forms. This suggests that the animal swam by undulation, waving its body to & fro, rather than using its paddles and tail.
The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami destroyed the local museum, but fortunately the specimens were not there at the time.

Maersk Alabama hijacking

The "Maersk Alabama" hijacking it was a hijacking of a Maersk Alabama sea boat. It was hijacked by four pirates in the Indian Ocean. It was southeast of Eyl, Somalia. The four pirates soon took its captain, Richard Phillips, as hostage on the Maersk Alabama's lifeboat.

He was arrested on site. The pirates wanted a ransom of 10 million dollars. Only three people died (all were the hijackers) during the attack.
The book "A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea" (2010) by Stephan Talty and Captain Richard Phillips was published soon afterwards. The hijacking also inspired the 2013 movie "Captain Phillips" starring Tom Hanks.
The leader of the attack, Abduwali Muse, is currently serving time in prison in Indiana.

Gum arabic

Gum arabic, also known as acacia gum, or meska, is a natural gum. It is made of hardened sap from two species of acacia tree; "Senegalia (Acacia) senegal" and "Vachellia (Acacia) seyal". The gum is got from wild trees throughout the Sahel from Senegal to Somalia. In the past it has also been cultivated in Arabia and west Asia. 
Gum arabic is a complex mixture of glycoproteins and polysaccharides. It was historically the source of the sugars arabinose and ribose, both of which were first discovered and isolated from it.
Acacia gum has been harvested in Arabia, Egypt, and west Asia since antiquity, and sub-Saharan acacia gum has a long history as a prized export. Traditionally harvested by semi-nomadic desert tribes on their travels, acacia gum is a main export of several African nations. The hardened gum is collected in the middle of the rainy season (harvesting usually begins in July), and exported at the start of the dry season (November).
From the 1950s to the early 1990s Sudan did about 80% of gum arabic production. Today, the figure is under 50%. Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese are dependent on gum arabic for their livelihoods. It is still the world's largest single producer, and the production of gum arabic is heavily controlled by the Sudanese government.
In food, gum arabic is used as a stabilizer. It is edible and has E number E414. Arab populations use the natural gum to make a chilled, sweetened, and flavored gelato-like dessert.
Gum arabic has been used from ancient times as part of black ink. The main constituent is carbon soot from lamps or burnt plant material. Apart from water and gum arabic, the ancient Egyptian ink was made of not much else. Written on paper or papyrus, this ink has survived for over three thousand years.
Gum arabic is a key ingredient in traditional lithography and is used in printing, paint production, glue, cosmetics and various industrial applications, including viscosity control in inks and in textile industries. Nowadays less expensive materials compete with it for many of these roles.
Gum arabic is used as a binder for watercolor painting because it dissolves easily in water. Pigment of any colour is suspended in the acacia gum to get in watercolor paint. Water acts as a vehicle to thin the watercolor paint and helps to transfer the paint to a surface such as paper. When all moisture evaporates, the acacia gum binds the pigment to the paper surface. After the water evaporates, the acacia gum in the paint film increases luminosity and helps prevent the colors from lightening. Gum arabic allows more precise control over washes, because it prevents them from flowing or bleeding beyond the brush stroke. In addition, acacia gum slows evaporation of water, giving slightly longer working time.
The historical photography process used gum arabic mixed with ammonium or potassium dichromate and pigment to create a coloured photographic emulsion that becomes relatively insoluble in water upon exposure to ultraviolet light. In the final print, the acacia gum permanently binds the pigments onto the paper.

The Overland Campaign was a series of battles in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War. It took place during May and June of 1864. Union general Ulysses S. Grant wanted to defeat the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, commanded by Robert E. Lee, and to wikt:capture the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. The battles were some of the bloodiest battles of the war.
In the spring of 1864, Grant had been appointed to command all Union armies. Grant's plan to end the war had several parts. Union General William Tecumseh Sherman's Atlanta Campaign and Grant's Overland Campaign were supported by other campaigns. They were all intended to keep Lee from reinforcing his main army. George Meade was still in (nominal) command of the Army of the Potomac, but there was little doubt Grant was in direct control of the army's movements.
Grant ordered General Franz Sigel to advance down the Shenandoah Valley to prevent reinforcements and supplies from reaching Lee's army. Grant ordered Benjamin F. Butler's Union Army of the James to cut the rail lines between Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia. This interrupted Lee's main supply line. Grant wanted to force Lee to attack even though Lee had no reinforcements and few supplies.
The campaigns were all to start at the beginning of May. The Army of the Potomac crossed the Rapidan River on May 4, moving south towards The Wilderness before Lee could attack them. But Lee attacked while Grant's army was still trying to move through the tangled forest. The Battle of the Wilderness started the campaign.

A shirtdress is a style of dress which borrows details from a boy's-man's dress shirt. These can include a collar, a button front, or cuffed sleeves. Often, these dresses are made up in crisp fabrics like cotton or silk, much like a men's dress shirt would be. As they are typically cut without a seam at the waist, these dresses often have a looser fit, usually relying on a belt to define the waist. Button fronts and a forgiving fit make this a flattering look for most body types.

Hylonomus

Hylonomus is an extinct stem tetrapod which lived 312 million years ago (mya) during the Pennsylvanian.
The lack of skull openings behind the eyes makes it difficult to decide whether or not it is a sauropsid. "Westlothiana" is older, but may have been an amphibian, and "Casineria" is rather fragmentary. 
"Hylonomus" was long (including the tail) and probably would have looked rather similar to modern lizards. It had small sharp teeth and likely ate small invertebrates such as millipedes or early insects.
Fossils of "Hylonomus" have been found in the remains of fossilized club moss stumps in Joggins Fossil Cliffs, Nova Scotia, Canada. The theory is that, after harsh weather, the club mosses would crash down. The stumps eventually hollow out. Small animals such as "Hylonomus", seeking shelter, might enter and become trapped, starving to death. Fossils of the basal pelycosaur "Archaeothyris" and the basal diapsid "Petrolacosaurus" are also found in the same region of Nova Scotia, higher up, dated about 6 million years later.
Some fossilized footprints, from about 315 mya, have been found in New Brunswick. They are attributed to "Hylonomus".

Terence V. Powderly

Terence Vincent Powderly (22 January 1849–24 June 1924) was an Irish-American politician and labor union leader. He was the first three-term mayor of Scranton, Pennsylvania. He had several top government jobs. He is best known as the leader of the Knights of Labor in the late 1880s. 
Terence V. Powderly was born in Carbondale, Pennsylvania on 22 January 1849. His parents, Terence Powderly and Madge Walsh, were Irish immigrants. As a young man he worked for the railroad as a . In 1871, he became a member of the International Machinists and Blacksmiths union. He later became its president. During the Long Depression (1873–1879), he didn't have a job. He was blacklisted for being a 'union '. 
In Scranton in 1976, Powderly joined the local branch of the Knights of Labor. He quickly moved up in the union. By 1879, he became the leader (his title was "Grand Master Workman"). While he was the leader, the Knights of Labor had the most members and most influence it ever had. After 1886, the Knights declined. In a struggle for power, Powderly was removed. His rival John William Hayes became the leader. Having lost his position, Powderly studied to become a lawyer. In 1894 he was admitted to the Bar (became a lawyer) in Pennsylvania. For this he was thrown out of the Knights of Labor.
While he was the Grand Master Workman, he was also the mayor of Scranton (1878–1884). In the 1896 presidential campaign, he supported Republican William McKinley. As a reward, President McKinley appointed Powderly United States Commissioner General of Immigration in 1897. He was dismissed as Commissioner General in 1902 by President Theodore Roosevelt. Powderly's work for immigration reform led to his dismissal. But in 1906 an investigation cleared him of any wrongdoing. He was given the position of Special Immigration Inspector. He then became Chief of the Division of Information in the US Department of Immigration from 1907 to 1921. Next he became Commissioner of Conciliation for the United States Department of Labor (1921–1924).
Powderly died in Washington, DC on 24 June 1924. Many early labor historians have been very critical of Powderly and the Knights of Labor. However, very few did more for the early labor movement. The actions and accomplishments of Terence V. Powderly have been reevaluated in the last twenty years. While he still has not had a "competent biographer", it is clear he and his Knights are becoming much more admired and respected. In 1999, Powderly was inducted into the Hall of Honor at the US Department of Labor.

Petrolacosaurus

Petrolacosaurus was a small, long animal, the earliest diapsid known. It lived during the later Carboniferous period. The strata where it was found in Kansas are of Pennsylvanian age, approximately 302 million years old. 
Its diet was probably small insects. "Petrolacosaurus" had distinctive canine-like secondary-sized teeth, a trait found mainly in therapsids, and later in mammals. Its fossils were found in Kansas, USA.
"Petrolacosaurus" was too derived to be the ancestor of all modern forms. In fact, it was already a diapsid, with two openings on each side of its skull to add attachment points for jaw muscles. Hence, it cannot have been the ancestor of any synapsids, which have only one such opening. Synapsids diverged from the common amniote tree before the diapsids did.
BBC Television in "Walking with Dinosaurs" made the mistake of talking about it as an ancestor of both reptiles and mammals.

Currey was born in Loch Sheldrake, New York. He was an orphan and grew up in foster care. He enlisted in the Army one week after he graduated high school. He was sent to and completed Officer Candidate School but was refused a commission for being too young. He completed his training with 75th Infantry Division. In the Spring of 1944 he was sent to England. But, due to a recent order by President Roosevelt, he was not allowed into combat until he was 19. After his birthday in June, he was sent to Normandy but didn't arrive until weeks after D-Day. He was sent to the 120th Infantry Regiment in the Netherlands. This was in September 1944. 
During the Battle of the Bulge Currey was in the town of Malmedy, Belgium. On December 21 the strongpoint he was defending was overrun by German Tanks and infantry. Currey and 5 other American soldiers withdrew to an old factory under intense enemy fire. Currey found a Bazooka and ammunition nearby. He fired the bazooka at the closest tank disabling it. Moving forward he then killed three enemy soldiers in the doorway of a house with his BAR. He fired the bazooka at the same house which caused the remaining Germans to run. He saw five more Americans under fire from three German Tanks. With Anti-Tank grenades he caused the Germans to abandon the tanks so the Americans could escape. He then covered their by firing an abandoned heavy machine gun at the Germans. He kept the Germans at bay for twelve hours. After nightfall Currey and his companions managed to find a jeep and return to their own lines. Sergeant Currie was credited with saving five fellow Americans, two of them wounded. He also stopped an attack by Germans that threatened to flank (attack from the side) his division.
In addition to being awarded the Medal of Honor, Francis Currey also received the Silver Star, Bronze Star Medal and Purple Heart. Belgium awarded him their nation's highest honor,the Order of Leopold. He was inducted into the New York State Senate Veterans' Hall of Fame in 2006.

Bronchiectasis

Bronchiectasis is an obstructive lung disease. It is caused by inflammation of the bronchi. It is sometimes said to be part of the group of diseases called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. People with bronchiectasis have swollen bronchi.
People with bronchiectasis have pain in their chests. Some people with bronchiectasis make sputum that is green or pale yellow. The most common symptom of bronchiectasis is a cough that does not go away. 9 out of 10 people with the disease have this symptom. 3 out of 4 people with bronchiectasis often cough up a lot of sputum. This causes tiredness. People with bronchiectasis may also cough up blood. This is called haemoptysis. People with bronchiectasis may have bad breath. Some people with bronchiectasis have sinusitis that does not go away.
There are three kinds of bronchiectasis. These are:
People can be born with bronchiectasis or they can develop it later. In about 4 out of 10 cases, a cause is found. People who have rheumatoid arthiritis and smoke are ten times more likely to have the disease. Patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency have also been found to be more likely to get bronchiectasis but it is not known why.
It is usually diagnosed using a CT scan.
Antibiotics are used to treat bronchiectasis. It can also be treated with other drugs. Sometimes surgery is needed.
René Laennec wrote the first description of bronchiectasis in 1819.

Decimal Day is the name that was given to 15 February 1971 in the United Kingdom (UK). It was the day that the UK decimalised (converted to a decimal-based system of currency). Before that date the UK used the "pound (£) - shilling (s) - pence (d)" currency system. The old system was known as the "£sd" system, after the abbreviations of the unit names. £sd is pronounced L-S-D. In the £sd system £1 = 20s and 1s = 12d, so £1 = 240d. In the new decimal system there are no shillings and there are 100 (new) pence (abbreviated as "p") in a pound - so £1 = 100p.

Silver Star

The Silver Star (officially the Silver Star Medal), is the United States third highest military decoration for valor. It can be awarded to any person serving in the United States Armed Forces. The medal is awarded for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United States.
The "Silver Star" is the successor award to the earlier "Citation Star". The Citation Star was established by an act of Congress on July 9, 1918. On July 19, 1932, the Secretary of War approved changing the "Citation Star" to the Silver Star Medal. The original "Citation Star" is added to the center of medal. The "Silver Star's" ribbon is red, white and blue. Authorization for the Silver Star Medal was placed into law by an act of Congress for the U.S. Navy on August 7, 1942. An Act of Congress for the U.S. Army was authorized on December 15, 1942. The US Army and Air Force currently awards the medal as the "Silver Star". The US Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard continues to award the medal as the "Silver Star Medal".
The Silver Star is awarded to anyone serving in or with the United States Armed Forces, for "gallantry in action". This is: 
Air Force pilots, combat systems officers, Navy and Marine Corps aviators and Naval Flight Officers flying fighter aircraft are often considered eligible to receive the Silver Star upon becoming an ace ( having five or more confirmed aerial kills). In multi-seat fighters, the weapon systems officer or radar intercept officer is also eligible. The Silver Star may also be awarded to members of the armed forces of friendly foreign nations meeting the criteria.
The Silver Star is worn on the uniform after the Distinguished Service Medal. It is to be worn before the Defense Superior Service Medal. When a second (or more) award is given for the Silver Star, an oak leaf cluster is added to the ribbon.

<doc id="442610" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=442610" title="Solar thermal energy">
Solar thermal energy

Solar thermal energy is a way of producing electricity in which the Sun's energy is concentrated by mirrors or lenses to either heat a fluid-filled pipe or drive a Stirling engine. The oil which is hot is circulated into a water storage system where it is used to change water into superheated steam, that then turns a turbine to generate electricity. The heat that is produced through this process powers a Stirling engine. The Stirling engine provides electricity and mechanical energy by having the fluid from within a cylinder expand, which then drives a piston that turns a shaft.
Solar thermal energy is primarily used domestically for space heating, hot water, and in some cases air conditioning. Solar thermal energy is renewable and no fuels are required during the process to generate electricity or mechanical energy. It is also carbon free except for production and transportation, otherwise it is non-polluting. Solar thermal can also be combined with photovoltaics (PVs), in highly efficient cogeneration systems. Some downsides are that solar thermal generates low grade energy, installation and construction costs are very high, it is expensive compared to conventional water heaters, and is hard to compete against cheap natural gas. An example of a Solar Thermal Electric Generation Plant is the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System that uses 300,000 computer-controlled mirrors, that focuses sunlight to the top of 459-foot towers, where water is turned into steam to power turbines.

Some of these are polar bears, grizzly bears, grey wolves, and caribou. Fish species include Dolly Varden, Arctic char, Lake trout and several kinds of salmon. There are at least 194 species of birds that visit or live here. The refuge totals 19,286,722 acres. 
In the ground under ANWR is one of the last major oil reserves in the United States. There are debates on whether or not to allow oil drilling. Those in favor have argued that removing the oil will make the U.S. less dependent on foreign supplies of oil. In the 1990s, the U.S. imported over half of the oil it used. ANWR is also near the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field. It contains large oil deposits that are already providing oil. But, the refuge land is a fragile natural environment. The area proposed for oil drilling is also the calving grounds for the Porcupine caribou herds.

<doc id="442613" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=442613" title="Scrubber">
Scrubber

Scrubber systems are used to make coal a "cleaner" fuel. Scrubbers remove sulfur from a power plant's exhaust. Scrubbers are of two types, wet scrubbers and dry scrubbers. Wet scrubbers use liquid chemicals to remove pollutants. Dry scrubbers typically use fabric filters. In many cases both are used together. As polluted air passes through a wet scrubber, chemicals in the scrubber react with the air pollution causing it to precipitate out. Modern scrubbers can remove up to 98% of the sulfur and 99% of the precipitate matter from within the smokestacks. The sulfur and metals that are removed from the scrubbers can be sold as a marketable products. Sludge from lime scrubbers can be sold to wallboard manufacturers, and fly ash from chimney flues can be sold to make lightweight concrete that can substitute for wood. The use of coal in the United States about doubled during the last quarter (25 years) of the 20th century. However, sulfur in the air was reduced by 30% during that same period. This shows that scrubbers work.

<doc id="442703" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=442703" title="Bronze Star Medal">
Bronze Star Medal

The Bronze Star Medal is the fourth-highest individual military award. It is the ninth-highest award by order of in the US Military. It may be awarded for acts of heroism, acts of merit, or meritorious service in a combat zone. When it is awarded for acts of heroism, the medal is awarded with the "V" device attached.
The medal is sometimes called the Bronze Star. Foreign soldiers, as well as officers from the other federal uniformed services are also eligible to receive the decoration. They must be serving with a service branch of the United States Armed Forces.
The Bronze Star Medal was an idea by Colonel Russell P. "Red" Reeder in 1943. He believed it would aid if there was a medal which could be awarded by captains of companies or batteries to deserving people serving under them. Reeder felt another medal was needed for ground forces that was equivalent to the Air Medal. He proposed that the new award be called the "Ground Medal". The idea eventually gained support. General George C. Marshall wrote a memorandum (note) to President Franklin D. Roosevelt dated 3 February 1944. He wrote: 
The Air Medal had been adopted two years earlier to raise airmen's morale. President Roosevelt authorized the Bronze Star Medal by Executive Order 9419 dated 4 February 1944. The order was made to 7 December 1941. The Executive Order was amended by President John F. Kennedy. The Executive Order 11046 dated 24 August 1962 expanded the authorization to include those serving with friendly forces. This allowed for awards where US service members might be involved in an armed conflict where the United States was not a . At the time of the Executive Order the US was not a belligerent in Vietnam. So any US advisers serving with the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces would not have been eligible for the award.
A study was conducted in 1947. The outcome was the policy was changed to make the retroactive award of the Bronze Star Medal (without the "V" device) to all soldiers who had received the Combat Infantryman Badge. It also included those who received the Combat Medical Badge during World War II. The reason for doing this was that the badges were awarded to soldiers who experienced the hardships described in General Marshall's memorandum. Both badges required a recommendation by the commander and a citation in orders.
The Bronze Star is worn on the uniform after the Soldier's Medal or the Airman's Medal. It is to be worn before the Purple Heart. When a second (or more) award is given for the Silver Star, an oak leaf cluster is added to the ribbon. The "V" device (for valor) is worn on the center of the ribbon. Any oak leaf clusters are worn to the right or left of the "V".

Neovenator

Neovenator is a dinosaur related to the clade which contains "Allosaurus" as its key member. Since the discovery of "Neovenator" on the Isle of Wight, UK, it has become one of the best-known large carnivorous dinosaurs in Europe. 
"Neovenator" was about 7.5 meters (24.5 feet) in length, and was of a slim build, weighting 10002000 kg. Some fossils suggest a length of about 10 meters (33 feet), but these fossils are very fragmentary. It lived during the early Cretaceous), about 125 million years ago.
Fossil remains of "Neovenator" have been found on the Isle of Wight (southern England), and were first discovered in the 20th century. "Neovenator" existed alongside "Baryonyx", "Polacanthus" and "Iguanadon" in the early Cretaceous. It was one of the top predators of its day.
The holotype of "Neovenator salerii" had many pathologies. They were "midcaudal vertebrae fusions, healed fractures of mid-caudal vertebra transverse processes; osteophytes affecting pedal phalanges, healed gastralia rib fractures, some forming false joints... [and] scapula fracture". This means the individual survived and healed after a number of bone fractures.

Purple Heart

The Purple Heart is a United States military decoration. It is awarded in the name of the President to those wounded or killed, while serving, on or after April 5, 1917, with the U.S. military. It is the successor to the Badge of Military Merit, which took the form of a heart made of purple cloth. The Purple Heart is the oldest military award still given to U.S. military members. The National Purple Heart Hall of Honor is located in New Windsor, New York.
The original Purple Heart, called the "Badge of Military Merit", was established by George Washington in 1782. The Badge of Military Merit was only awarded to three Revolutionary War soldiers. If any more had been awarded, any records of being given that award have been lost. The badge was never abolished, it was just forgotten about until after World War I. 
In 1932 General Douglas MacArthur urged the revival of the Purple Heart medal and he was awarded the first one. The War Department authorized the medal under General Order Number 3. The award was "to be awarded to persons who, while serving in the Army of the United States perform any singular meritorious act of extraordinary fidelity or essential service." 
With the establishment of the Legion of Merit award, the Purple Heart was no longer awarded for meritorious service. By Executive Order 9277, dated December 3, 1942, the award was to only be given for wounds received. Additional Executive orders added circumstances where the award can be given. In 1962 it was ordered the medal could be given posthumously (after the person died). A 1984 change allowed the award to be given for woulds as a result of terrorist attacks or while serving as part of a peacekeeping force. In 1986 public Law 99-145 authorized the award for wounds received as a result of friendly fire. 
Because the medal was given out during many conflicts, the exact number of Purple Hearts awarded is not known.
The Silver Star is worn on the uniform after the Bronze Star Medal. It is to be worn before the Defense Meritorious Service Medal. In the Army and Air Force when a second or more Purple Heart is awarded, oak leaf clusters are used. The Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard use 5/16 inch stars to show multiple awards.

Chaohusaurus

Chaohusaurus is an extinct genus of basal ichthyopterygian, or ichthyosaur, from the Lower Triassic of Chaohu and Yuanan, China. 
It was closer in time and form to "Cymbospondylus" and "Mixosaurus" than to more advanced genera like "Ichthyosaurus". It did not have the dolphin-like form of later ichthyosaurs, but it was fully aquatic. The tail fin is wide-based and short. The neck is rather long, whereas later ichthyosaurs have no neck. There is no dorsal fin.
It was one of the smallest ichthyosaurs, about 70 to 180 cm long. Its weight was about 10 kg.
A recent study of "Chaohusaurus" shows an early example of live birth. A remarkable feature was a baby close to emerging "head-first". The authors comment:
In other words, ichthyosaurs gave live birth when they were still land dwellers. Then, later, they adapted to an aquatic life.

Algebraic variety

In mathematics, algebraic varieties (also called varieties) are one of the central objects of study in algebraic geometry. The first definitons of algebraic variety defined it as the set of solutions of a system of polynomial equations, over the real or complex numbers. Modern definitions of an algebraic variety generalize this notion while they try to preserve the geometric intuition behind the original definition.
Conventions regarding the definition of an algebraic variety differ: Some authors require that an "algebraic variety" is, by definition, "irreducible" (which means that it is not the union of two smaller sets that are closed in the Zariski topology), while others do not. When the former convention is used, non-irreducible algebraic varieties are called algebraic sets.
The notion of variety is similar to that of manifold. One difference between a variety and a manifold is that a variety may have singular points, while a manifold will not. 
Proven around the year 1800, the fundamental theorem of algebra establishes a link between algebra and geometry by showing that a monic polynomial in one variable with complex coefficients (an algebraic object) is determined by the set of its roots (a geometric object). Generalizing this result, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz provides a fundamental correspondence between ideals of polynomial rings and algebraic sets. Using the Nullstellensatz and related results, mathematicians have established a strong correspondence between questions on algebraic sets and questions of ring theory. This correspondence is the specifity of algebraic geometry among the other subareas of geometry.

Similarity (geometry)

Similarity is an idea in geometry. It means that two polygons, line segments, or other figures have the same shape. Similar objects do not need to have the same size. Two shapes are similar if their angles have the same measure and their sides are proportional. Two circles, squares, or line segments are always similar.
Triangles are special in similarity. This is because triangles can be similar if only their angles are equal, or only their sides are proportional. All other polygons must meet both of the conditions.
Similarity is very similar to congruence. Congruent shapes have the same sides and angles. In fact, all shapes that are congruent to each other are also similar.

Distinguished Service Cross (United States)

The Distinguished Service Cross (abbreviation DSC) is the second highest military award that can be given to a member of the United States Army. It is awarded for extreme gallantry and risk of life in actual combat with an armed enemy force. Actions that merit the Distinguished Service Cross must be above those required for all other U.S. combat decorations, but are not high enough for the Medal of Honor. The Distinguished Service Cross is the same as the Navy Cross (Navy and Marine Corps). The Air Force) has the Air Force Cross and the Coast Guard has the equivalent Coast Guard Cross. All are equivalent (equal) awards.
The Distinguished Service Cross was first awarded during World War I. In addition, a number of awards were made for actions before World War I. These were to soldiers who had received a 'Certificate of Merit' for gallantry. At the time the certificate was given it was the only other honor for gallantry the Army could award other than a Medal of Honor. Others were awarded for earlier actions in the Philippines, on the Mexican Border and during the Boxer Rebellion.
The Distinguished Service Cross may be awarded to any person serving in any capacity with the United States Army. The person must distinguish himself or herself by extraordinary heroism while engaged in an action against an enemy. Or, while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing/foreign force or while serving with friendly forces. The act or acts of heroism must have been so notable and have involved risk of life so extraordinary as to set the individual apart from his or her comrades. But it is not sufficient to merit the Medal of Honor.
The Distinguished Service Cross is worn on the uniform after the Defense Distinguished Service Medal. It is to be worn before the Silver Star. When a second (or more) award is given an oak leaf cluster is added to the award.

Algebraic geometry

Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics studying polynomial equations. Modern algebraic geometry is based on more abstract techniques of abstract algebra, especially commutative algebra, with the language and the problems of geometry.
The main objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties, which are geometric manifestations of sets of solutions of systems of polynomial equations. Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are: plane algebraic curves, which include lines, circles, parabolas, ellipses, hyperbolas, cubic curves like elliptic curves and quartic curves like lemniscates, and Cassini ovals. A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation. Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the singular points, the inflection points and the points at infinity. More advanced questions involve the topology of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations.
Algebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics. The concepts it uses connects it to such diverse fields as complex analysis, topology and number theory. At the start, algebraic geometry was about studying systems of polynomial equations in several variables. Algebraic geometry starts at the point where equation solving leaves off: In many cases, finding the properties all the solutions a given set of equations have is more important than finding a particular solution: this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.
In the 20th century, algebraic geometry has split into several subareas.
Much of the development of the main stream of algebraic geometry in the 20th century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework, with increasing emphasis being placed on "intrinsic" properties of algebraic varieties not dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient coordinate space. The developments in topology, differential and complex geometry occurred much in the same way. One key achievement of this abstract algebraic geometry is Grothendieck's scheme theory which allows one to use sheaf theory to study algebraic varieties in a way which is very similar to its use in the study of differential and analytic manifolds. This is obtained by extending the notion of point: In classical algebraic geometry, a point of an affine variety may be identified, through Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, with a maximal ideal of the coordinate ring, while the points of the corresponding affine scheme are all prime ideals of this ring. This means that a point of such a scheme may be either a usual point or a subvariety. This approach also enables a unification of the language and the tools of classical algebraic geometry, mainly concerned with complex points, and of algebraic number theory. Wiles's proof of the longstanding conjecture called Fermat's last theorem is an example of the power of this approach.

Duke of Noailles

The title of Duke of Noailles was a French peerage created in 1663 for Anne de Noailles, Count of Ayen. 
Noailles is the name of a great French family, derived from the castle of Noailles in the territory of Ayen, between Brive and Turenne in the Limousin, and claiming to date back to the 11th century. It did not obtain fame until the 16th century, when its head, Antoine de Noailles (1504–1562), became admiral of France and was ambassador in England during three important years, 1553–1556, maintaining a gallant but unsuccessful rivalry with the Spanish ambassador, Simon Renard. 
Henri (1554–1623), son of Antoine, was a commander in the religious wars and was made Count of Ayen by Henry IV of France in 1593.
The title of Duke of Ayen was also given to the family. However, the heir to the Noailles dukedom was usually called the "Prince of Poix". 
The family owned a lavish townhouse in Paris called the "Hôtel de Noailles". 
The present holder of the title is Hélie de Noailles, but as France is now a republic, titles are not officially recognised.

Samuel Leo LoPresti (January 30, 1917 – December 11, 1984) was an American professional ice hockey goaltender. LoPresti played 2 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played with the Chicago Black Hawks. LoPresti also played 3 seasons for the St. Paul Saints and 13 games with the Kansas City Americans; both of the AHA. He made NHL history on March 4 during a game against the Boston Bruins. He faced a league record 83 shots in a regulation, 60 minute game.
He decided to leave the NHL to join the United States Navy in World War II. He served as a gunner's mate on the SS "Roger B. Taney". When the ship was torpedoed and sunk during an Atlantic crossing in February 1943, LoPresti was listed as missing in action and was thought to be the first casualty among American professional athletes in the conflict.
He was one of 29 people who took refuge in a single lifeboat with a small amount of water or food. They drifted for 42 days and traveled nearly 2,500 miles (4,000 km) southwest before they were found and rescued off the coast of Brazil. The men collected rain water when they could and sometimes drank only 4 imperial fluid ounces (110 mL) per day and had only a small amount of biscuits and bakers chocolate for food. LoPresti was credited with having saved the men's lives after he caught the only real food they had during their entire ordeal after he noticed dolphins that were swimming around their boat on one occasion. He improvised a weapon by lashing a sheath knife to a boat hook, he plunged into the ocean, caught a 35-pound (16 kg) dolphin and they hauled it into the boat. They then drank its blood and cooked the meat in a metal bucket with rags and kerosene.
He was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1973. He died on December 11, 1984 in Eveleth, Minnesota from a heart attack.

American Athletic Conference

The American Athletic Conference (also known as "The American" or "AAC") is a big college sports conference in the United States. Its members play in NCAA Division I. In football, they play in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS; known before 2006 as Division I-A), the higher of two levels of Division I football.
The American has its roots in the original Big East Conference. That conference was started in 1979 as a basketball-first league by a group of schools in the Eastern U.S. The Big East added football in 1991. That led to years of conflict between schools that played I-A/FBS football and those that did not. In July 2013, the Big East split into two conferences. The seven schools that did not play FBS football left to form a new Big East Conference. The FBS schools that did not go to other conferences stayed in the old conference structure. Along with several new members, they began operating as the American Athletic Conference.
The American kept the original Big East charter. That makes it the legal successor of the old Big East. However, both The American and the new Big East claim 1979 as their founding dates. Both also claim the pre-split history of the old Big East.
As of the 2015–16 school year, The American has three "associate members" that play only one sport in the conference.
Two schools left The American after spending only the 2013–14 school year in the renamed conference. Before 2013, both had been members of the original Big East.
One other school was a member in a single sport starting from the Big East/American split in 2013 through 2015.
The American holds championships in 10 men's sports and 11 women's sports:

On May 14, 2009, Haley announced that she would run for the Republican nomination for Governor of South Carolina in 2010.
The Republican gubernatorial primary took place on June 8, 2010, and Haley captured 49% of the vote, necessitating a runoff election on June 22. Haley won handily in the runoff vote. Haley was elected governor on November 2, 2010, over the Democratic candidate, Vincent Sheheen 51% to 47%. On August 12, 2013, Haley announced she would seek a second term during a rally August 26, 2013, at the BI-LO Center in downtown Greenville. Haley was re-elected on November 4, 2014, with a 55.9 percent to 41.3 percent win, almost tripling her previous margin of victory over Sheheen in 2010 gubernatorial elections.
Haley supports lower taxes, opposes regulation and is extremely anti-union. In June 2015, following the Charleston church shooting, Haley led bi-partisan calls for the removal of the Confederate flag from the State Capitol and its grounds. In July 2015, Haley signed a Bill to authorize removing the Confederate flag from the flagpole on the grounds of the South Carolina Capitol.
In April 2016, Haley indicated she would not support legislation introduced by the South Carolina State Senate which would require transgender individuals to use restrooms based on biological sex instead of gender identity.
On November 23, 2016 President-elect Donald Trump announced his intention to nominate Haley for Ambassador to the United Nations. On January 20, 2017, President Donald Trump sent Haley's nomination to the Senate. Haley was overwhelmingly confirmed by the Senate 96-4 on January 24, 2017.

Roberts also played for the New Haven Eagles and Philadelphia Arrows of the CAHL, the Cleveland Falcons/Cleveland Barons of the IHL/IAHL/AHL, the Pittsburgh Hornets of the AHL, and the Washington Lions of the EHL.
He retired from playing professional ice hockey in 1947. Roberts for many years held the distinction of being both the youngest and the oldest goaltender in National Hockey League history. On December 8, 1925, he made his debut at age 19 for the Boston Bruins which made him the youngest goaltender in NHL history (the record was later broken by Harry Lumley 20 years later). On November 25, 1951, Roberts (at that point an assistant trainer with the Chicago Black Hawks) had to play the third period of the game because Lumley had been injured. Even though Roberts did not give up a goal, the Hawks still lost to the Detroit Red Wings, 5-2. Roberts at age 45, in his last NHL game, became the oldest player ever to play in an NHL game (the record was later broken by Gordie Howe and then Chris Chelios). He is still the oldest goaltender to play in an NHL game and was also the final NHL player to have been active in the 1920s.
He was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2005.

Non-coding DNA

Non-coding DNA sequences are those parts of an organism's DNA that do not code for protein sequences. 
Some non-coding DNA is transcribed into functional non-coding RNA molecules (e.g. transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and regulatory RNAs), while others are not transcribed or give rise to RNA transcripts of unknown function. The amount of non-coding DNA varies greatly among species. For example, over 98% of the human genome is noncoding DNA, while only about 2% of a typical bacterial genome is non-coding DNA.
Initially, a large proportion of non-coding DNA had no known biological function. It was known as "junk DNA", particularly in the press. However, it has been known for years that many non-coding sequences are functional. These include genes for functional RNA molecules and DNA sequences such as "start replication" signals, centromeres, and telomeres.
Other noncoding sequences have likely, but not yet discovered, functions. This is inferred from the high levels of sequence similarity seen in different species of DNA.
The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project suggested in September 2012 that over 80% of DNA in the human genome "serves some purpose, biochemically speaking". This conclusion was strongly criticized by some other scientists.

Time of My Life (2011 TV series)

Time of My Life is a 2011 Philippine drama billed as a "danserye" (dance TV series), created and developed by GMA Network, starring Mark Herras and Kris Bernal. It premiered on August 1, 2011 on GMA Network in the Philippines and on August 3, 2011 on GMA Pinoy TV.
The very first danserye is based on original concept created for GMA Television by Senedy Que with head writer Des Garbes Severino, choreographers Miggy Tanchanco (modern) and Donald Balbuena (ballroom), and directors Mark Reyes (musicals) and Andoy Ranay (drama). In 2010 it was planned for a working title Jump. It is supposed to be replacing "Tween Hearts" but the GMA Network decided to put it on the Primetime block. The show is slated for 2011 despite 2010. Several auditions across the Philippines were held. And the auditionees were seen in Party Pilipinas (until it was premiered on August 2011), with a working title Time of My Life.

Blarney Castle

Blarney Castle is a 15th-century castle in County Cork in Ireland. Blarney is in the historic Irish Province of Munster. The Blarney Stone is in the castle. The Blarney Stone is one of the biggest tourist attractions in Ireland.
Blarney Castle is a well preserved 15th century building. It is in the small town of Blarney, County Cork in Ireland. Blarney is about 6 miles northwest of the city of Cork. There are not many good buildings in County Cork that were built before the 19th century. The castle is also one of Ireland's oldest and most historic castles. The walls of the castle are up to 18 feet thick.
Blarney Castle was built in 1446 by Dermot MacCarthy. He was King of South Munster. The castle is the third building on the site. The first was built of wood. In about 1210 a stone building was built in place of the wooden one. Finally, in 1446 the current castle was built by MacCarthy.
Queen Elizabeth I of England wanted the castle. She told the Earl of Leicester to get it for her. However, he was never able to get it because MacCarthy always made excuses to stop it happening.
Oliver Cromwell's army won the castle by force. They did not capture the soldiers living in it though. They had escaped through tunnels and caves underneath.
The Blarney Stone is a slab of limestone. The size of the stone is about 4 feet long and 1 foot wide. It is built into the castle's battlements 83 feet up from the ground.
There are lots of myths about where the stone came from. Some say it came from the prophet Jeremiah. Some say it came from Stonehenge. It is supposed to have been given to Dermot MacCarthy by Robert the Bruce. The gift was for help fighting against the English at the 1314 battle of Bannockburn.
In 2014 scientists in Scotland examined a piece of the stone. They found that it was a piece of limestone from close to the castle. The stone is about 330 million years old.
The Blarney stone is one of Ireland's biggest tourist attractions. Hundreds of tourists visit Blarney Castle every day. The visitors go to kiss the Blarney Stone. People think that kissing the stone will give them the "gift of the gab" (make them good at talking). There is usually a long queue of people waiting to kiss it. To kiss the stone people have to lie on their backs and let their heads hang back over a ledge.

Order of Leopold (Belgium)

The Order of Leopold (, ) is one of the three (current) Belgian national honorary orders of knighthood. It is the highest order of Belgium. It is named in honour of King Leopold I. It consists of a military, a maritime and a civilian division. The maritime division is only awarded to personnel of the merchant navy, and the military division to military personnel. The decoration was established on 11 July 1832. It is awarded for extreme bravery in combat or for meritorious service of immense benefit to the Belgian nation. The Order of Leopold is awarded by Royal Decree.
During the Second World War, the Order of Leopold was awarded to officers of foreign militaries who had helped to liberate Belgium from the occupation of German forces. Famous recipients include Brand Whitlock, George S. Patton, Bernard Montgomery, Dwight Eisenhower, and Wesley Clark. Medal of Honor recepient Sergeant Francis S. Currey was awarded the Order of Leopold for his actions at Malmedy, Belgium in late 1944. The medal was also granted to Karel Bossart in 1962, and Josip Broz Tito in 1970.

Prickly pear

The prickly pear is Opuntia: a genus in the cactus family, Cactaceae.
The genus is named after the Ancient Greek city of Opus. There, according to Theophrastus, an edible plant grew which could be propagated by rooting its leaves. 
Prickly pears (mostly "Opuntia stricta") were originally imported into Australia in the 18th century for gardens. They were later used as a natural agricultural fencing. They quickly became a widespread invasive weed. They changed of farming land into an impenetrable green jungle of prickly pear, in places high. 
In 1919, the Australian federal government established the Commonwealth Prickly Pear Board to coordinate efforts with state governments to eradicate the weed. Early attempts at mechanical removal and poisonous chemicals failed, so in a last resort, biological control was attempted. There is a moth, "Cactoblastis cactorum", from South America, whose larvae eat prickly pear. It was introduced in 1925 and rapidly reduced the cactus population. A memorial hall in Chinchilla (Queensland) commemorates the moth. This is one of the earliest known examples of the biological control of pests.

Magnetic field line

A magnetic field line or magnetic flux line shows the direction of a magnet's force and the strength of a magnet. 
The idea of lines of force was invented by Michael Faraday. His theory is that all of reality is made up of force itself. His theory predicts that electricity, light, and gravity have finite propagation delays. Einstein's theory agrees with this. 
One can make magnetic field lines show as if they were physical phenomena. For example, iron filings placed in a magnetic field line up to form lines that correspond to 'field lines'. 
If there are a lot of lines through a magnet and not a great space between them, the magnet is strong. If the lines between a magnet are far apart and there aren't many lines, the magnet is weak. A way of determining the strength of a magnet is to do an experiment with iron filings. The iron filings will get attracted to the magnet and move into the shape of the flux lines. You then look at the shape of the iron filings and see the gap between the flux lines. This gives you an idea of the strength of the magnet.
The use of iron filings to display a field "alters the magnetic field so that it is much larger along the "lines" of iron". This caused by the large permeability of iron relative to air. Magnetic fields' "lines" are also visually displayed in polar auroras, when particles cause visible streaks of light that line up with the local direction of Earth's magnetic field.
Magnetic field lines are like the contour lines (constant altitude) on a topographic map in that they represent something continuous, and a different mapping scale would show more or fewer lines. There is an advantage to using magnetic field lines as a representation. Many laws of magnetism (and electromagnetism) can be stated completely and concisely using simple concepts such as the 'number' of field lines through a surface. These concepts can be quickly 'translated' to their mathematical form.

Thorny devil

The thorny devil (Moloch horridus) is also called the mountain devil, thorny lizard, thorny dragon or moloch. It is a cold blooded Australian lizard, that lives in the desert regions of central Australia. 
The thorny devil grows up to 200mm long and can live for at least 20 years. A thorny devil was first put on display in London by John Gould in 1840. It mainly eats ants, and may eat thousands of ants in a day.
Female thorny devils lay ten eggs during the September-December season (or Spring-Summer). They put the eggs in a burrow about 30 cm deep. These eggs hatch after about 3 or 4 months, but not all babies will survive, because of predators like wild birds and goannas.
The thorny devil is found in the arid regions of central Australia. It lives in sand, spinifex grasslands and scrub.
Ideally adapted to its harsh, desert habitat, it uses narrow channels between the scales on its stomach and legs to collect morning dew and water from damp sand. The water travels up these channels to the lizard’s mouth.
The thorny devil has some unique adaptations. These are used mainly for hiding and self-defence from one of their predators, the goanna.
The thorny devil is coloured in shades of desert brown and tans, which blend in with their background. These colours change from pale colours during warmer weather and darker colours during colder weather.
The thorny devil has a “false head” on the back of its neck. When the lizard feels threatened, it lowers its real head, and reveals the false head so that the predators do not see the thorny devil's real head.
The thorny devil is covered in lots of hard spikes across its entire upper side. Predators do not like to eat the thorny devil, as it is hard to swallow with all the spikes on it.

Address Resolution Protocol

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a network layer protocol used to convert an IP address into a physical address (called a DLC address), such as an Ethernet address. A host wishing to obtain a physical address broadcasts an ARP request onto the TCP/IP network. The host on the network that has the IP address in the request then replies with its physical hardware address.
There is also Reverse ARP (RARP) which can be used by a host to discover its IP address. In this case, the host broadcasts its physical address and a RARP server replies with the host's IP address.

Summerhill School

Summerhill School is an independent British boarding school which was founded in 1921 by A.S. Neill (Alexander Sutherland Neill). He believed the school should fit the child, not than the other way around. 
Summerhill is run as a democratic community. Decisions are made in school meetings, which anyone, staff or pupil, may attend, and at which everyone has an equal vote. These meetings serve as both a legislative and judicial body. Summerhill is the oldest "children's democracy" in the world. It is probably the most famous alternative or 'free' school.
Members of the community are free to do as they please, so long as their actions do not cause any harm to others, according to Neill's principle "Freedom, not Licence". This extends to the freedom for pupils to choose which lessons, if any, they attend.
The school is not large. It varies 6080 boys and girls with ages ranging from 5 to 17. The school is now owned by Zoë Readhead, the daughter of A.S. Neill.
Apparently it does. The most recent OFSTED inspection of the school reported:

Rachel Jackson

Rachel Donelson Jackson (June 15, 1767 – December 22, 1828) was the wife of Andrew Jackson, the seventh president. She died before her husband's inauguration. She was never First Lady.
Young Rachel was very pretty, with dark brown hair and beautiful eyes. Her family moved from Virginia to Nashville, Tennessee. The Robards family was quite wealthy and important in Nashville. Rachel was married to Captain Lewis Robards in Kentucky. She met Andrew Jackson while living with her mother. Andrew was staying at her mother's house. One time, she sent a letter home asking one of her brothers to come to Kentucky. She wanted to go home again. Jackson went to Kentucky instead of her brother.
Rachel Donelson Robards and Andrew Jackson wanted to get married. They could not because Rachel was already married to Lewis Robards. She tried to get a divorce in 1790.

Rachel died in 1828. This was the year her husband Andrew became president. He thought she died because other people said mean things about her. They talked about her marriage. Many people said she broke the law to marry Andrew on purpose. This made her very sad. She was buried in a corner of the Hermitage garden.
People thought Rachel and Andrew were very different. Andrew was tall, important, and neat. Rachel was short, quiet, and common. One girl who visited their house would not have guessed that they were married. She thought they were too different. The visitor said that Rachel was kind and motherly, not elegant or graceful. Rachel had lived in the frontier (newly-lived in areas) her whole life. She had no reason to become elegant.
Rachel loved Andrew very much. She was sad every time he went away. Once, she travelled to meet him, which was not common for women to do. She was very worried when he was in danger. She became quite sick from stress. Her marriage was very important to her. A visitor once said that their love was very great. Andrew Jackson always treated Rachel like she was the best thing in his life. Rachel was always devoted to Andrew.

<doc id="443384" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=443384" title="Abbot Oliba">
Abbot Oliba

Oliba (c. 971–1046) was the count of Berga (998–1003) and Ripoll and later bishop of Vic (1018–1046) and abbot of Sant Miquel de Cuixà. He is considered one of the spiritual founders of Catalonia. And perhaps the most important prelate of his age in the Iberian Peninsula.
Oliba was a writer. From his "scriptorium" at Ripoll flowed a lot of works about his world. Most importantly, are the Arabic manuscripts. He translated it into Latin for the benefit of all Europe.
Oliba was born in circa 971 in an rich family. He was the third son of a Catalan count house. He abdicated his possessions to take up the Benedictine habit in the Monastery of Santa Maria de Ripoll. He had three brothers and a sister.
In 988, the Count Oliba Cabreta takes the habits and retired to Montecassino with St. Romuald, which met in Cuixà.
Oliba begin to do his countal functions. So, while his brother Bernard inherited Besalú and Guifré Cerdanya, Oliva received Berga and Ripoll.
Between 988 and 1002, Oliva was count of Berga and Ripoll. He was associated with his brother Guifré.
Oliba promoted the movement of Peace and Truce of God (Catalan: "Pau i Treva de Déu"), towards 1022. In 1027 the agreement of this treaty with other bishops and noblemen took place in Toulouges (Roussillon). In this treaty was said that all agreed to make days in which nobody could fight with anybody and the fugitives could take refuge in churches.
So influential was Oliba, that, in 1023, King Sancho III of Navarre consulted him on the propriety of marrying his sister Urraca to her second cousin Alfonso V of León. The bishop objected, but Sancho ignored him. His letters to the various contemporaneous kings of Spain indicate to us that Alfonso and his successor, Vermudo III, were regarded as "imperatore. "And the king of Navarre was a mere "rex".
Oliba founded or reformed the monasteries of Montserrat (1025), Fluvià, and Canigó. And he consecrated or patronized numerous other churches, such as the Collegiate Basilica of Manresa. It was he who created the Assemblies of Peace and Truce, the seeds of the future Catalan "corts". He improved the decoration of his own church at Ripoll and rededicated it on 15 January 1032. He was a close advisor to Count Berengar Raymond I of Barcelona and reconstructed the cathedral of Vic with the support of his Countess Ermesinda. The new cathedral was rededicated to Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. He died at his monastery at Cuixà in 1046.
In August 1002, when he was 31 years old he entered the Benedictine Order in the Monastery of Ripoll.
In 1008, after the death of Abbot Seniofré, Olive was elected abbot of the monastery. Shortly months later he was elected abbot of the Monastery of St. Miquel de Cuixà. Olive began a series of actions to promote a more austere discipline in monasteries.
The fame of the abbot made ​​the following year, 1009, also elected abbot of Sant Martí del Canigó. Other monasteries accommodate his style of government, such as the monasteries of Sant Feliu and Sant Sadurní Tavèrnoles.
Oliba devotes much of its efforts to defend the property and rights of churches to attacks by his manor. In 1011 he had the audience in the Vatican and the Pope Sergius IV won a number of bulls for their monasteries. These papal bulls had significant power: the Pope, God's representative on earth, said that the monasteries and lands owned were under the protection of St. Peter and the Vatican attack on the monastery was an aggression against authority of the Pope.
Catalonia, in the late tenth century, became a major cultural center, direct access to Arabic science and importantly the accumulated prestige "scriptoria" monasteries placed the Catalonia Catalan culture as a leader in Europe.
Of all the Catalan "scriptorium" was the most important Ripoll. Pope Sylvester II introduced in Europe the Arabic numbers and the concept of zero, and the astrolabe thanks to lessons learned Ripoll. The library Ripoll was, at the time of Oliba, which comes to triple the number of volumes under its mandate, together with the Bobbio, one of the most important of all Christendom.
Under the mandate of Oliba, the Monastery suffered architectural modifications. Oliba did build a walkway around the sanctuary with three apses. Then, he built a dome over the altar and the crypt erected Nativity, Chapel of the Trinity and the two towers Lombard (of which only one is preserved).
The monastery of St. Martí del Canigó was founded by the brother of Oliba, Count Gifré II of Cerdanya-Conflent. Gifré took an old church at the foot of Canigó and became an important monastery. 
In 1009 had become church and its community was made ​​up of monks from Cuixà, which became abbot in Oliba community until 1014 in which the community already had enough monks appoint an abbot among them.

Durrington Walls

Durrington Walls is the site of a large Neolithic settlement and later henge enclosure in the Stonehenge World Heritage Site. It is 2 miles north-east of Stonehenge in the parish of Durrington, just north of Amesbury.
Excavations in 2013 by a team has revealed a huge settlement; 1,000 homes have been found, supporting a population of 4,000 people at one time. The village was carbon dated to about 2600 B.C.
The monument was on "an extraordinary scale" and unique, researchers said.
The Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes team has been creating an underground map of the area in a five-year project.
Remote sensing and geophysical imaging technology has been used to reveal evidence of nearly 100 stones without the need for excavation.
The monument is just under two miles (3km) from Stonehenge, Wiltshire, and is thought to have been a Neolithic ritual site.
It is the "largest Neolithic settlement in the whole of northern Europe". At 500m in diameter, the henge is the largest in Britain and recent evidence suggests that it was a complementary monument to Stonehenge.
What visibly remains of Durrington Walls today is the 'walls' of the henge monument. This is now a ridge surrounding a central basin. Originally the ditch was some 5.5m deep, 7m wide at its bottom and 18m wide at the top. The bank was in some areas 30m wide. There were two entrances through the bank and ditch – at the north western and south eastern ends. The henge enclosed several timber circles and smaller enclosures – not all of which have been excavated. Several Neolithic house floors have been found next to and under the eastern bank of the henge. Their density suggests that there was a very large village on the sloping river bank on this side.
About three feet underneath Durrington Walls, there are remains of about 90 standing stones, maybe from an earlier time. The stones are in a "slightly curved row." They were found in 2015, using special archaeological research tools and methods including ground-penetrating radar. Scientists do not know if this feature is the same age as early Stonehenge or not.

Alpha and Omega 3: The Great Wolf Games

Alpha and Omega 3: The Great Wolf Games is a 2014 American computer-animated comedy/adventure movie. It is the third installment in the "Alpha and Omega" franchise. Like the second one, this movie is directed by Richard Rich and Perry Andelin Blake and written by Tom Kane. "Alpha and Omega 3" follows the story of The Great Wolf Games, a contest where puppies from different packs compete. Runt, Stinky and Claudette also join in, even though their pack "took a pass on the games", with Humphrey as their coach.
The movie is a sequel to "Alpha and Omega" and "". It came out on iTunes on March 4, 2014 and it's available for download. It was released on March 25, 2014 as a Walmart Exclusive. Just like the second movie, "Alpha and Omega 3" received mixed reviews by critics (having 44% in Rotten Tomatoes and a 42 out of 100 in Metacritic) and mostly positive reviews by fans (with audience rating of 77%). However, it wasn't as successful as "Alpha and Omega 2".
Kate, Humphrey, and the puppies are back in Jasper. Kate has to leave on hunting trip with the others. Humphrey has to take care of the puppies. Runt, Stinky and Claudette hear about The Great Wolf Games from another puppy from the Northern Pack named Fleet.

Once again, "Alpha and Omega 3: The Great Wolf Games" received mixed reviews from critics. It had a 44% rating in Rotten Tomatoes and a 42 out of 100 in Metacritic. The movie's consensus in Rotten Tomatoes is: "Alpha and Omega 3: The Great Wolf Games" does have improved animation, lovable characters and it'll definitely entertain kids and die hard fans of the franchise, but it seems to suffer from a lazy story and a thinly-written script". Critics noted the animation's improvement, nice humor, likable characters and improved ending, but criticized the movie's story and the absence of the rest of the main characters. However, fans of the franchise had mostly positive reactions for the movie. Though they expressed disappointment on the story and for the lack of the original characters, they praised the movie on everything else. "Alpha and Omega 3" had a fresh audience rating of 77% on the Rotten Tomatoes Community.

Anzu

Anzu is a genus of oviraptorosaurian dinosaurs from the latest Cretaceous, 66 million years ago (mya). Its remains were found in North and South Dakota. The type species is "Anzu wyliei".
"Anzu wyliei" had a toothless beak, a prominent crest, long arms ending in slender relatively straight claws, long powerful legs with slender toes, and a very long tail. In life, the animal was about to long and to in weight. It was one of the largest known oviraptorosaurs and the largest known from North America (though the giant Mongolian oviraptorosaur "Gigantoraptor" was far larger).
The type species is the first well-preserved example of a North American oviraptorosaur. According to a paleontologist at the Smithsonian "for almost a hundred years, the presence of oviraptorosaurs in North America was only known from a few bits of skeleton, and the details of their appearance and biology remained a mystery. With the discovery of "A. wyliei", we finally have the fossil evidence to show what this species looked like and how it is related to other dinosaurs". The creature's formidable appearance – "big crests on their skulls, a beak, no teeth, and a very bird-like skeleton" – led to it being jokingly called the "chicken from hell" in press releases.
The fossils of "Anzu wyliei" were found in mudstone rock that had once been part of ancient floodplains. Its Asian counterparts lived in arid or semi-arid conditions. 
Its lifestyle was that of "a fast-running, ecological generalist that didn't quite fit the usual moulds of meat-eating or plant-eating dinosaur". It was not on the direct line of descent of modern birds, but it did have bird-like features: 
The function of "Anzu's" large crest is debated. The crest "is very large and made of paper-thin bone, so it was not able to take much stress. All oviraptosaurs have this crest but it is certainly the largest in "A. wyliei"". The most likely function is for display, signalling to members of its own species. Also, it might be used to attract a mate. 
The fossils showed evidence of injuries, including a healed broken rib and an arthritic toe that was probably the result of a tendon being ripped away from the bone. It is not known whether this indicates that the animals fought each other, or were injured by predators.

Benign neonatal seizures

Benign neonatal seizures are somewhat rare syndromes (medical problems) which cause "seizures" in newborn infants. A seizure is caused by problems in the electrical activity in the brain. 
One syndrome is "Benign idiopathic neonatal seizures" (BINS) and the other is "Benign familial neonatal seizures" (BFNS). Both syndromes usually happen in infants in the neonatal period, which is the first 28 days after birth. In most cases, the first seizure happens within the first few days after birth. However, some infants may have their first seizure later in the neonatal period, or even months after the neonatal period. The last seizure usually happens while the infant is still in the neonatal period, but seizures may continue after this time.
A third syndrome called "benign familial neonatal-infantile syndrome" (BFNIS). It may cause the first seizure between the second day upwards to 6 months after birth, and usually stops within the first 12 months. 
These syndromes are called ""benign" because they usually cause no long-term harm to the infant, but there is a greater chance of getting seizures later in life. 
In Benign idiopathic neonatal seizures the cause is not known (this is what the word "idiopathic"" means). In Benign familial neonatal seizures and Benign familial neonatal-infantile seizures, there is a "genetic mutation," which means a change in the genes that an infant gets from their parents. These disorders are inherited (they "run in the family"). This is what the word "familial" means.

He became the youngest captain in Predators history and was the only captain of the Predators to have been drafted by the team.
During the 2012 offseason, the Predators were unable to take Weber to arbitration again (a player can only be subjected to team-elected arbitration once in his career). Weber signed a front-loaded $110 million, 14-year offer sheet, $68 million of it as a signing bonus, with the Philadelphia Flyers on July 19. It was the richest contract in NHL history in terms of total money, money per season, and length, which surpassed the previous offer sheet record set by Thomas Vanek. The Predators, who had already lost Weber's defensive partner Ryan Suter to unrestricted free agency, were able to match the offer sheet five days later.
On June 29th 2016, Shea Weber was traded to the Montreal Canadiens for P.K. Subban.

Hyman Minsky

Hyman Philip Minsky (September 23, 1919 – October 24, 1996) was an American economist, a professor of economics at Washington University in St. Louis. 
He gave an explanation of financial crises, caused by swings in a potentially fragile financial system. Minsky is sometimes described as a post-Keynesian economist because, like Keynes, he supported some government intervention in financial markets. He opposed some of the financial deregulation policies popular in the 1980s. He supported the Federal Reserve as a "lender of last resort" (which means he thought it right for the Fed to bail out banks which might go bust). He argued against too much private debt in the financial markets.
Minsky proposed theories were about the normal life cycle of an economy. He linked financial market fragility with speculative investment bubbles in financial markets. Minsky claimed that in prosperous times, when companies make plenty of money, an irrational euphoria develops. Soon debts exceed what borrowers can pay off from their income, which produces a financial crisis. As a result, banks and lenders tighten credit, even to companies that can afford loans. Then the economy contracts.
This slow movement of the financial system from stability to fragility, followed by crisis, is something for which Minsky is best known, and the phrase "Minsky moment" refers to it.
At the University of California, Berkeley seminars attended by Bank of America executives helped him to develop his theories. His views were published in two books, "John Maynard Keynes" (1975), a classic study of the economist and his contributions, and "Stabilizing an Unstable Economy" (1986), and more than a hundred professional articles.

Bucket-wheel excavators (BWEs) are huge machines used for surface mining. 
They are continuous digging machines in large-scale open cast mining operations. What sets BWEs apart from other large-scale mining equipment is their large wheel with a continuous pattern of buckets to scoop material as the wheel turns. 
They are among the largest vehicles ever constructed. The biggest bucket-wheel excavator ever built, Bagger 293, is the largest terrestrial (land) vehicle in human history..
BWEs built since the 1990s, such as the Bagger 293, have reached sizes as large as 96 metres (314.9 feet) tall, 225 metres (738.2 feet) long, and as heavy as 14,200 metric tons (31.3 million lb). The bucket-wheel itself can be over 70 feet in diameter with as many as 20 buckets, each of which can hold over 15 cubic metres of material. BWEs are now capable of operating in extreme climates. Many BWEs have been designed to operate in climates with temperatures as low as -45°C (-49°F).

Spandrel

A spandrel is the space between two arches. It is the space between an arch and a rectangular fence or the space between the right and left exterior curve of an arch and an enclosing right angle.
In structures with more than one floor, the term "spandrel" can also mean the space between the top of the window in one floor and the threshold of the window in the floor above.
Spandrels have different meanings in architecture and art history.
Arches commonly exist in bridge constructions, so spandrels may appear in such structures. Historically, most arch expansions had solid spandrels, meaning that the areas between arches were completely filled in with masonry. This was true until the use of steel and reinforced concrete began in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Structures of domes can also contain spandrels. Where domes are needed to rest on a square or a rectangular base, the dome is raised above the level of the supporting pillars with three-dimensional spandrels called pendentives. These triangular segments take the weight of the dome and place it onto the poles.

<doc id="444290" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=444290" title="Meninges">
Meninges

The meninges are the membranes that surround and protect the brain and the spinal cord. In mammals, the meninges have three layers: the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater.
In the space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater (called the "subarachnoid space"), there is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a special fluid which bathes the brain and spinal cord. The meninges and the CSF work together to cushion and protect the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord).
The pia mater (or "pia") is the layer of the meninges that is closest to the brain and spinal cord. It is a thin, delicate layer ("pia mater" means "tender mother" in Latin). The pia mater sticks very closely to both the brain and spinal cord. The pia mater is made of cells that fluid cannot get through. This prevents cerebrospinal fluid from reaching the brain.
The smallest type of blood vessels, called capillaries, go through the pia mater and bring the brain the things it needs, like blood and oxygen. The pia's capillaries also make up an important part of the blood-brain barrier. This is the brain's "security system." It controls what can leave the bloodstream and get into the brain's nerve cells, and what cannot. 
The pia's capillaries are lined with cells that are packed very closely together. Only certain things can get through these cells and reach the brain. This helps block things like bacteria and some poisons from getting into the brain. It also lets in the things that the brain needs to survive, like glucose (sugar), water, and white blood cells (which fight infection).
The arachnoid mater is the middle layer of the meninges. It is a thin, clear membrane that fits loosely over the pia mater. This leaves a space in between these two layers called the "subarachnoid space." ("Subarachnoid space" means "the space under the arachnoid.") Cerebrospinal fluid flows through the subarachnoid space.
One of the arachnoid layer's most important jobs is to cushion the brain. Like the pia mater, the arachnoid mater is made of cells that fluid cannot get through. Because fluid cannot get through either of these layers, the cerebrospinal fluid stays in the subarachnoid space and does not leak out. Having this layer of fluid helps protect the brain, like a car's airbag. Without this cushion, every time a person moved their head, their brain would hit the inside of the skull and would get hurt.
The arachnoid mater also has an important job in the blood-brain barrier. Blood runs through the dura mater, the last layer of the meninges. The arachnoid mater keeps blood from getting through into the cerebrospinal fluid. This is important, because if blood gets through the arachnoid mater into the cerebrospinal fluid, the brain and spinal cord can get irritated and infected. Like all parts of the body, the arachnoid mater needs blood and oxygen to survive. Small blood vessels bring these things to the arachnoid layer. However, the arachnoid layer prevents the blood from getting through to the cerebrospinal fluid.
The arachnoid mater is attached to the last layer of the meninges: the dura mater.
The dura mater (or "dura") is the layer of the meninges that is farthest from the skull and the spinal cord. It is a thick, protective layer. ("Dura mater" means "tough mother" in Latin.) The dura protects the brain from being scraped and hurt by the skull, which is very rough.
The dura mater has the largest blood vessels of all three layers of the meninges. The veins in the dura carry blood from the brain to the heart after the brain has used up the oxygen in the blood. The arteries in the dura carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart. These arteries split into the capillaries in the pia mater.
The dura also folds into the brain in four different places to separate parts of the brain, including the two cerebral hemispheres.
Some medical professionals use a mnemonic acronym to remember the layers in the meninges and what order they go in. The mnemonic is: "The meninges PAD the brain":
Because the meninges do many important things for the central nervous system, problems with the meninges can be very dangerous. The most common problems with the meninges are caused by infections or bleeding in the meninges.
When blood vessels in the meninges break or are injured, those blood vessels will cause bleeding in the meninges. Bleeding in the meninges is a type of stroke called a hemorrhagic stroke. ("Hemorrhagic" means "caused by dangerous bleeding (hemorrhage)"). Bleeding in the meninges is very dangerous, because if enough blood builds up, the blood can squeeze or crush the brain.
The blood-brain barrier in the meninges' blood vessels protects the brain from most pathogens (things that cause infection). Because of this, infections in the brain are not very common. This is important, because antibodies - which the body's immune system makes to fight off infections - cannot get past the blood-brain barrier into the brain. Neither can most antibiotic medications. This means that when a person does get a brain infection, the body usually cannot fight off the infection on its own, and most of the medications that doctors use to kill infections cannot get into the brain to kill the pathogens inside.
However, some viruses, bacteria, and other germs are able to get through the blood-brain barrier and cause infections. Examples of these infections include:

Luka Rocco Magnotta (born Eric Clinton Kirk Newman; July 24, 1982) is a Canadian pornographic actor and model. He was convicted of murdering and dismembering his male lover Lin Jun, a Chinese international student, then mailing his severed limbs to different political parties and elementary schools.
Magnotta has had schizophrenia since 2000. He was convicted of fraud in Toronto in 2005 and sentenced to community service and probation.
After an 11-minute video titled "1 Lunatic 1 Ice Pick" was uploaded to Bestgore.com which allegedly showed the murder was posted online, Magnotta fled Canada and was the subject of a Interpol Red Notice which lead to an international manhunt. Magnotta was arrested after he was found in an Internet café in Berlin while he was reading news about himself. He tried to give police fake names before he admitted who he was. He was handed over to Canadian authorities in Berlin on June 18, 2012 and was flown back to Canada on a Royal Canadian Air Force CC-150 Polaris. Magnotta was placed into solitary confinement at the Rivière-des-Prairies detention centre.
At 11 AM on May 29, 2012, a package which contained a left foot was delivered to the headquarters of the Conservative Party of Canada. Another package which contained a left hand was addressed to the Liberal Party but was intercepted in a Canada Post processing facility. A janitor found a decomposing torso in a suitcase. It was left in a garbage pile in the alley behind an apartment building in the Snowdon area of Montreal. On June 5, 2012, a package which contained a right foot was delivered to St. George's School and another package which contained a right hand to False Creek Elementary School in Vancouver.
On June 6, 2012, Lin Jun's family arrived at Trudeau Airport in Montreal. A candlelight vigil was then held in Montreal.
The body parts were later matched to Lin Jun by DNA samples from his family. After police received an anonymous tip, they recovered Lin Jun's head which was lying at the edge of a small lake in Montreal's Angrignon Park.
On July 11, Lin's body was cremated and his ashes were buried in the Notre-Dame-des-Neiges cemetery in Montreal.
Canadian media named Magnotta the Canadian Newsmaker of the Year which caused controversy.
After committal for trial, the preliminary inquiry judge set a tentative trial for September 8, 2014 on April 29, 2013. On 29 September 2014 in court in Quebec, Magnotta admitted killing Jun Lin. He pleaded not guilty to murder due to his schizophrenia. He has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder.
After a twelve-week trial, the jury received their final instructions from the trial judge on December 15, 2014. On their eighth day of the jury's deliberation, they returned a verdict of guilty on all charges. Magnotta is serving a life sentence and he will be eligible for parole in 25 years. Magnotta was also sentenced to 19 years for other charges.
Magnotta was previously sought by animal rights groups for allegedly uploading videos of himself killing kittens.

Agent 47

Agent 47 is a fictional character and the champion of "Hitman (video game series)" franchise. The character was created by the Danish company IO Interactive.
There are six video game titles for Agent 47. They are "Hitman: Codename 47 (2000)", "Hitman 2: Silent Assassin (2002)", "Hitman: Contracts (2004)", "Hitman: Blood Money (2006)", "Hitman: Absolution (2012)" and "Hitman 6" which is currently being made by IO Interactive and will be the sixth game of the series.
Agent 47's appearance consisted of a pure black suit, black leather gloves, a white dress shirt and a red tie. Hitman video game series allow the player to engage in stealth mode strategy to avoid direct conflict with the victims. Agent 47 also has the ability to change what he looks like by exchanging different customs which can be stolen from knocked-out, killed victims or from certain places to make the progression easier. The outfits can come from many different NPCs.
Agent 47 has no hair with very white skin and blue eyes. His ICA file from states his height as 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m). In , his weight is given as . Agent 47 has a bar code tattooed on the back of his head which was very prominent in all games except for "Hitman: Absolution" where the bar code was most of the time covered in order for the character to disguise himself after it was known that Agent 47 has this bar code that could get him more notoriety.
His bar code is considered as a security key to access areas of the facility where he was created and trained. Although, in "Hitman: Blood Money" game failed to mention the bar code as a notable characteristic.
Agent 47's facial features are quite imposing, with a long face, large cheekbones, prominent brow, recessed forehead and ice blue eyes. Early in "Hitman: Absolution", 47 tries to remove his iconic bar code with a razor, but it remains visible at the end of the game.
Agent 47 was born on September 5, 1964 in a Romanian asylum with the number 640509-040147 tattooed on the back of his head in the form of a bar code. "64-05-09" refer to his date of birth, "04" indicates Series IV, "01" documents his class and "47" is the order in which he was cloned. According to the Hitman game series and the Hitman novel, Agent 47 is a genetically-enhanced clone and the culmination of decades of secret research into gene augmentation. His creation was funded by five criminal masterminds who donated their own DNA to the project. Aside from The Five Fathers, the maternal DNA was provided by Anghel Comescu. However, his surrogate mother was Teadora Blaga. In "Hitman 2: Silent Assassin", Agent 47 decided to quit killing people for money and lived in a shelter provided by Vittorio, but had to change his mind after Vittorio got kidnapped. Eventually after many missions handled successfully by 47, "Diana" brought the Agency to its knees. She flushed all accounts, cut off all communication lines, exposed the Agency and used the confusion to vanish and 47 puts an end to "Diana" handling a hit on her.
Even though 47 is meant to be an emotionless assassin, he shows signs of morality, seen in "Hitman 2: Silent Assassin" confessing his sins (killing people for money) to Father Vittorio. Subsequently, he is so depressed at the apparent loss of his spiritual guide that he agrees to take on the "suicide mission" of killing "Deewana Ji". He is very quiet to the point of being socially awkward which is perhaps the biggest of his very weaknesses. He prefers to stay alone and he has admiration for few people he befriends, especially "Diana" and "Vittorio".
Agent 47 approaches his assassinations with professionalism but will, however show no remorse or regression when it comes to killing or silencing witnesses. Agent 47 speaks in a very formal tone, a tone that shows no threat, rarely swearing or even raising his voice. Given his fees, 47 would have to be a multi-millionaire from his contract earnings but never stops going for new contracts. He only spends his money on simple things like food, suits, gear, and shelter, although he is also known to donate some of it to "Father Vittorio".
Agent 47 can take on hard tasks and perform physical tasks more efficiently than any average human. 47 has mastered the art of stealth. He knows how to efficiently and successfully sneak up to a victim and use his assassin fiber wire to eliminate the victim or an injection to poison the victim or knock him/her out. 47 being able to terminate multiple enemies in the same area one at a time and sneak up on almost anybody and quietly neutralize them. Agent 47 also has a lot of knowledge about disguising techniques and ways of accessing unauthorized areas of a location. He is physically strong even when compared to average adult males of his size and build; being able to climb pipes, move and dispose of bodies, snap necks, knock opponents unconscious and jump from a balcony to another balcony, spending a minimum effort. 47 also happen to be a skilled driver and seen piloting helicopters and planes.
Agent 47 has a special level of skill when it comes to using improvised weapons such as explosives, sniper rifles, automatic weapons and bladed weapons. Being able to hold dual pistols firing both of them at the same time whilst hitting the targets. He is a perfect marksman, so well that the newspaper in "Hitman: Blood Money" called him "Legendary Agent 47".

Tailstrike

A tailstrike is when the tail of an airplane hits the runway. This can happen during takeoff or landing. During takeoff, a tailstrike can happen if the pilot raises the nose too early and the plane cannot take off in time. During a landing, a tailstrike can happen if the pilot raises the nose too high during landing.
Tailstrikes usually do not have serious effects, such as killing people. However, this means that the airline has to spend money to repair the plane before it can fly again. If the plane is not repaired correctly, it may cause metal fatigue and in the end, the plane can crash.

The 1994 Vancouver Stanley Cup Riot was a riot that took place on June 14, 1994 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was the first riot in Vancouver since the tour opener for The Rolling Stones which lead to a clash between police officers and 2,000 Stones fans outside the Pacific Coliseum in 1972.
The riot took place after the New York Rangers defeated the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals. The riot started on Robson and Thurlow Street after a man fell off of a streetlight into the crowd. When police, who were on bikes, were trying to escort paramedics into the crowd, some members of the crowd tried to take the bikes from the police. Police warned the crowd to clear out and retreated. 
After a while, riot police gathered in the crowd and fired tear gas. This caused the crowd to scatter in different directions. Lots of stores had their windows broken, including 50 windows smashed at a Eaton's store.
The tear gas that was fired drifted into the open windows of residents living on the West End. St. Paul's Hospital responded by putting guards at the emergency room entrance to prevent tear gas victims from entering there. They claimed that there was nothing that could be done for them. After a while, bowls filled with water were put outside by security guards for the people that were suffering from tear gas. The total damage to the downtown core was estimated at $1.1 million CAD.

Operation Yellow Ribbon

Operation Yellow Ribbon was started by Canada to help with the diversion of civilian airline flights because of the September 11 attacks in 2001. It was to make sure that possible destructive air traffic was removed from the United States airspace as quickly as possible, and away from potential U.S. targets. Instead they placed the aircraft on the ground in Canada, mainly at military and civilian airports in the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and British Columbia (as well as some in New Brunswick, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec). Canada began the operation after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (carried out by Security Control of Air Traffic and Air Navigation Aids (SCATANA)) had grounded all the aircraft across the United States. The FAA was then able to work with Transport Canada to reroute the incoming international flights to airports in Canada.
The actual number of diverted aircraft and passengers varies from different sources. Transport Canada stated that over 33,000 passengers on 224 flights arrived in Canada, while NAV CANADA stated that there were 239 flights. Prime Minister Jean Chrétien said that the number of flights was anywhere between 225 and 250 and that the number of passengers were between 30,000 and 45,000.
On the tenth anniversary of 9/11, President Barack Obama recalled Canada's help during that time, and he expressed his gratitude for Canada's friendship and solidarity.

Cuvier's beaked whale

Cuvier's beaked whale ("Ziphius cavirostris"), is the only member of the genus Ziphius. It is the most widely distributed of all the beaked whales.
It is a record deep diver: 
The French anatomist Georges Cuvier, in his "Sur les Ossemens fossiles" (1823), first described the species based on an imperfect skull from the Mediterranean coast of France. A peasant had found it on the shore in 1803. 
Cuvier named it "Ziphius cavirostris". The specific name comes from the Latin "cavus" for "hollow" or "concave". This refers to the deep hollow in the skull, a diagnostic trait of the species. Cuvier believed it was an extinct species. In 1850 zoologists realized the species was still living, when Paul Gervais compared the type specimen to a whale stranded at Aresquiès, Hérault. He found the two to be identical.
Cuvier's beaked whale feeds on several species of squid. They also prey on deep-sea fish. On March 27 2014 a Cuvier's beaked whale tracked by a satellite-linked tag set a new deep diving record for a sea mammal, plunging nearly two miles below the ocean surface. 
Although it is in the Odontoceti, it has little use for teeth. As adults, two incisors at the front of the lower jaw stick forward. Basically, it sucks in prey by expanding its throat.

The maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) is a species of beetle in the family Curculionidae. In the United States, it is called the greater rice weevil. It lives in many tropical areas around the world, and in the United States. It is a major pest of maize. This species attacks both crops that are still growing and those that have been harvested. It attacks wheat, rice, sorghum, oats, barley, rye, buckwheat, peas, and cottonseed. The maize weevil also attacks processed cereal products such as pasta, cassava, and various coarse, milled grains. It has even been known to attack fruit while in storage, such as apples.

Susumu Ohno

Susumu Ohno was born of Japanese parents in Seoul, Korea, on February 1, 1928. The family returned to Japan after the war in 1945. 
His passion for science came from his lifelong love of horses. He earned a Ph.D. in veterinary science at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology in 1949, and later a Ph.D. and D.Sc. from Hokkaido University. 
Ohno suggested that gene duplication plays a major role in evolution in his classic book "Evolution by Gene Duplication" (1970). 
Subsequent research has overwhelmingly confirmed the key role of gene duplication in molecular evolution. Sometimes. one gene copy, or "paralog", takes on a totally new function after a gene duplication event. This means one of the gene copies mutates to develop a function that was not present in the ancestral gene. In this way, a gene duplication may lead to new possibilities in its descendents.
Normally, a big change in gene function is resisted because the original function is needed, but after a duplication one gene carries on the original function. Therefore, a change of function in the second copy is possible without loss of fitness.
In his book, he also suggested that vertebrate genome is the result of one or more entire genome duplications. Variations of this idea have come to be known as the 2R hypothesis (also called "Ohno's hypothesis"). He indicated that mammalian X chromosomes are conserved among species: it has been referred to as Ohno's law. He also invented the term Junk DNA for segments of the DNA that have no known function.

Blue shift

Blue shift is one example of the Doppler effect. It is the opposite effect to redshift.
Doppler blueshift is caused by movement of a source towards the observer. The term applies to any decrease in wavelength caused by relative motion, even outside the visible spectrum. 
The wavelength of any reflected or emitted photon or other particle is shortened in the direction of travel.
Doppler blueshift is used in astronomy to determine relative motion:
The reason astronomers can tell how far the light gets shifted is because certain chemical elements, like the calcium in bones or the oxygen people breathe has a unique fingerprint of light that no other chemical element has. They can see what colors of light are coming from a star, and see what it is made of. Once they know that, they look at the difference between where the fingerprint (called spectral lines) is and where it is supposed to be. When they see that, they can tell how far away the star is, whether it is moving toward us or away from us, and also how fast it is going, since the faster it goes, the farther the distance the spectral lines are from where they should be.

Mycoplasma genitalium

Mycoplasma genitalium is a small parasitic bacterium which lives on the ciliated epithelial cells of the primate genital and respiratory tracts.
It has one of the smallest known genomes, and is one of the smallest bacteria. Other very small bacteria are the endosymbiont "Candidatus" Carsonella ruddii, and the recently discovered bacterium "Nanoarchaeum". The smallest known free living bacterium is "Pelagibacter ubique" with 1.3 Mb.
"Mycoplasma genitalium" was originally isolated in 1980 from the urethras of two male humans with non-gonococcal urethritis. Infection by "M. genitalium" is fairly common, and is transmitted between partners during unprotected sexual intercourse. It can be treated with antibiotics. Much remains to be discovered about its role in sexual disease.
"M. genitalium" has 525 genes. There are 482 protein-encoding genes in a circular chromosome of 582,970 base pairs. An initial study of the "M. genitalium" genome with shotgun sequencing was done by Peterson in 1993. It was then sequenced by Fraser and others. It was found to contain only 470 predicted coding regions, including genes required for DNA replication, transcription and translation, DNA repair, cellular transport, and energy metabolism. It was the second complete bacterial genome ever sequenced, after "Haemophilus influenzae".

Basin and Range

The Basin and Range Province is a vast geographic region in the west United States and northwest Mexico. Its topography has abrupt changes in height. It has narrow faulted mountain chains and flat arid valleys or basins. There are many ecoregions, but the lower part is mostly desert. 
The physical geography (physiography) of the province was caused by extension and thinning of the lithosphere, which is composed of crust and upper mantle. What caused this thinning is still being investigated. The thinning began around 17 million years ago (mya) in early Miocene time.
The highest point fully within the Province is White Mountain Peak in California, while the lowest point is Badwater Basin in Death Valley. Other high points are at the boundary of the Basin and Range province.
The numerous ranges within the Province in the United States are collectively referred to as the Great Basin Ranges, although many are not actually in the Great Basin. The Basin and Range province should not be confused with the Great Basin, which is a sub-section of the greater Basin and Range region. The Great Basin is defined by its watershed (internal drainage).
Clarence Dutton compared the many narrow mountain ranges of the Basin and Range to an "army of caterpillars marching toward Mexico", which is a helpful way to visualize the overall appearance of the region.

Equation solving

Equation solving is field of mathematics that is about finding the functions or values that will make an equation true. An equation says that two expressions are equal. These expressions contain one or more unknowns, which are usually called free variables. 
There are a number of changes (transformations) that can be done to make it easier to find the solution. There are many kinds of equation, and some have no solution in the domain (field) where they are studied. Other kinds of equation cannot be solved exactly, and approximation needs to be used. Similarly, a system of equations may have no solutions, or an infinite number of solutions.

<doc id="444753" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=444753" title="Pseudo-Nero">
Pseudo-Nero

The Roman emperor Nero committed suicide near the villa of his freedman Phaon in June of 68 AD. Between the autumn of 69 AD and the reign of the emperor Domitian, some people appeared and claimed they were Nero. These impostors were known as Pseudo-Nero. Most scholars believe there were either two or three Nero impostors. St. Augustine wrote of the popularity of the belief that Nero would return in his day, which is known as the Nero Redivivus legend. Suetonius writes that imperial edicts were forged in the name of dead Nero. These edicts encouraged his followers and promised that he would soon return to avenge himself on his enemies.
One of the things that led to the belief that Nero survived was the fact that he died in a location that was not well known. Suetonius wrote that Galba's freedman Icelus saw the dead emperor's body and reported back to his master. Nero was also denied the lavish burial that was accorded to popular emperors and members of the imperial family. This may have left those plebeians who loved him dissatisfied and suspicious. Furthermore, he was not buried in the Mausoleum of Augustus with the other Julio-Claudian emperors, but in a tomb on the Pincian Hill at the family burial place of the Domitii Ahenobarbi. Many Roman plebeians though Nero was very popular after his death, and so they laid flowers at his tomb.
After Nero's death, there were prophecies that predicted he would regain his kingdom in the East. These prophecies possibly inspired people to impersonate him. One version placed his reappearance at Jerusalem. The prophecies have been tied to Nero's natal chart, which has been interpreted as pointing to a loss of his patrimony and its recovery in the East. Tacitus may have been referring to such prophecies in veiled language when he wrote of the rumors that circulated about Nero after his death, which had contributed to the belief that he had survived. The return of Nero may have inspired the author of the Book of Revelation when he wrote about the eschatological opponent called the Beast, which is mortally wounded and then miraculously heals. The number of the Beast, 666 or 616, depending on the manuscript, has been identified by some as the numerical value of the letters in Nero's name. Nero also appears more explicitly in this role in the Ascension of Isaiah and some of the books of the Sibylline Oracles. Because of these prophecies and others, Nero was long thought to be the Antichrist.
Due to the short-lived success of the Nero impostors and Nero's incorporation into eschatological literature, the belief in Nero's imminent return lasted for centuries. Lion Feuchtwanger wrote a historical novel based on the second known Pseudo-Nero, Terentius Maximus, entitled "Der falsche Nero". This novel was published in 1936.
The first Pseudo-Nero appeared in the autumn of 68 AD or the early winter of 69 AD in the Roman province of Achaia, today modern Greece. Nero had visited Greece (66–67 AD) to participate in its Panhellenic Games, and this may account for some of the support the impostor received. Tacitus attributed the whole phenomenon to the gullibility and restive nature of the Greeks, whom he seems to have disliked. The impostor, according to Tacitus, was either a slave from Pontus, or a freedman from Italy. The historian does not reveal much about the early career of the impostor, except to say that the Pseudo-Nero gathered around him a group of army deserters and then set out to sea.
The impostor's group was blown by storm to the island of Kythnos, one of the lesser islands of the Cyclades, which had only one community worthy of the appellation "polis" in antiquity—the city of Cythnus. Here he supposedly engaged in piracy by waylaying merchants, stealing their cargo, and arming their slaves. Cythnus was long known as a popular base for pirates. The false Nero also made appeals to bring Roman soldiers en route to Italy over to his growing armed force. Nero's successor Galba probably assigned Calpurnius Asprenas with the task of hunting down the impostor on his way to take up the governorship of the province of Galatia and Pamphylia. With information provided by naval captains that the Pseudo-Nero had attempted to seduce to his side, Asprenas ordered his soldiers to storm the ship and kill the impostor. Asprenas then sent the head of the impostor on a tour of Asia and then on to Rome.
The second pseudo-Nero appeared during the reign of Titus. He was an Asiatic named Terentius Maximus and also sang to the accompaniment of the lyre and looked like Nero. He gained a great number of followers across the Euphrates to Parthia. He later fled to Parthia and tried to gain their support by claiming that they owed him some requital for the return of Armenia. Artabanus III, the Parthian King, out of anger towards Titus, both received him and made preparations to restore him to Rome. He was executed when his true identity was revealed.
The third pseudo-Nero appeared twenty years after Nero's death, during the reign of Domitian. Supported by the Parthians, they hardly could be persuaded to give him up and the matter almost came to war.

American cordillera

The American cordillera is a chain of mountain ranges. It is a sequence of mountain ranges that form the western "backbone" of North America, Central America, South America and Antarctica. It is also the backbone of the volcanic arc that forms the eastern half of the Pacific Ring of Fire.
From north to south, this sequence of overlapping and parallel ranges begins with the Alaska Range and the Brooks Range in Alaska and runs through the Yukon into British Columbia. The main belt of the Rocky Mountains along with the parallel Coast Ranges of mountains and islands continue through British Columbia and Vancouver Island. In the United States, the cordillera branches to include the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and the Cascades and Coast ranges of Washington, Oregon, and California. In Mexico, the cordillera continues through the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental, as well as the backbone mountains of the Baja California peninsula.
The ranges of the Cordillera from Mexico northwards are called the North American cordillera or Western cordillera in the United States and Canada, and the Canadian cordillera or Pacific cordillera in Canada.
The cordillera continues on through the mountain ranges of Central America in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama, and becomes the Andes Mountains of South America. The Andes with their parallel chains and the island chains off the coast of Chile continue through Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile to the very tip of South America at Tierra del Fuego. In addition, the range can possibly be followed through the South Georgia Ridge across the Southern Ocean to the mountains of Graham Land on the Antarctic Peninsula.

The Palace of Caserta is a palace in Italy. It is just outside Naples. It was built by King Carlo VII of Naples. It was one of the largest buildings built in Italy in the 8th century. It was mainly used as a summer residence of the royal family of the Two Sicilies. In Italian it is known as the Reggia di Caserta. The palace has some 1,200 rooms, including two dozen state apartments, a large library, and a theatre modelled after the Teatro San Carlo of Naples. It is often compared to the Palace of Versailles and therefore called the "Italian Versailles".
In 1997, the palace was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The nomination described it as "the swan song of the spectacular art of the Baroque, from which it adopted all the features needed to create the illusions of multidirectional space". The king wanted a magnificent new royal court and administrative center for the Kingdom in a place protected from sea attack.

A blazar is a very compact quasar (quasi-stellar radio source). They have a presumed supermassive black hole at the center of an active, giant elliptical galaxy. Blazars are among the most energetic phenomena in the universe and are an important topic in astronomy.
Blazars are one of a group of active galaxies that host active galactic nuclei (AGN). An AGN is a region at the centre of a galaxy which has a much higher than normal luminosity over some or all of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
The name "blazar" was originally coined in 1978 by astronomer Edward Spiegel. Blazars are AGN with a relativistic jet which is pointing in the general direction of the Earth. We observe "down" the jet, or nearly so. Many blazars have apparent superluminal features within the first few parsecs of their jets, probably due to relativistic shock fronts.
The blazar at the centre of galaxy M87 is fuelled by a black hole with a mass of about three billion solar masses within ten light years of the galaxy centre.

<doc id="444799" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=444799" title="BASE jumping">
BASE jumping

BASE jumping is a fringe sport in which a person jumps from a fixed place and uses a parachute to slow down before the ground is reached. "BASE" is an acronym that stands for each of the four jump location categories: from buildings, antennas, spans (bridges) and the earth. This last is similar to "jumping off a cliff". BASE jumping is an extreme sport. This means it involves speed, height, danger or spectacular stunts. 
The idea for BASE jumping came from skydiving. BASE jumping is much more dangerous than skydiving from aircraft. 
BASE jumps are usually made from much lower altitudes than skydives. Also, the jumper leaps closer to the platform or standing space. BASE jumpers fall through the air at slower speeds than skydivers, because they begin the jump closer to the ground. As a skydiver falls, he accelerates while falling and gains speed with each second. So a BASE jumper does not always reach terminal velocity. Because faster speed while falling through the air gives jumpers more control of their bodies, and a quicker parachute opening, the longer the delay in the air, the safer.
Another danger is that most BASE jumpers have very small areas in which to land. A beginner skydiver, after the parachute opens, may have about three minutes or more of a parachute ride to reach the ground. A BASE jump from 500 feet will only have a parachute ride of 10 to 15 seconds.
BASE jumping has a death rate averaging about one fatality for every sixty jumpers. It is one of the most dangerous sporting activities in the world. It has a fatality and injury rate 43 times higher than parachuting from a plane. 
As of the end of July 2015, at least 264 people have died during a BASE jump.
Dean Potter and Graham Hunt were killed in a BASE jump attempt at Yosemite National Park in California on May 16, 2015. Potter was a well known rock climber. They jumped at dusk from about 3000 feet up. They both quickly smashed into the rocks of the cliff on the way down. Neither jumper used a parachute that might have saved them.
American BASE jumper Ian Flanders died in Kemaliye, Turkey on July 21, 2015. His parachute got tangled in his feet after he jumped and did not open. He fell 900 feet into the Karasu river at a high speed. The jump was being shown live on a local television station.
After the death in Turkey, a fellow jumper said to People Magazine, "There's just this very thin margin of how things can go from 'totally fine' to 'it's over'. And it's really hard to do this sport a lot and have that margin not catch up with you."
In September 2013, three men jumped off the incompletely built "One World Trade Center" in New York City. They filmed their jump using cameras on their heads and later showed the video on YouTube. In March 2014, the three jumpers and one helper on the ground were arrested after turning themselves in.

Amoebozoa

The Amoebozoa are a eukaryote phylum of "Amoeba"-like protozoa. Most move by internal cytoplasmic flow. Their finger-like pseudopodia are characteristic.
They are a major group with about 2,400 described species of amoeboid protists. In most classification schemes, Amoebozoa is ranked as a phylum in either the kingdom Protista or the kingdom Protozoa. In the classification of the International Society of Protistologists, it is kept as an unranked "supergroup" in the Eukaryota.
Sequence analysis shows Amoebozoa is a monophyletic clade. Most phylogenetic trees identify it as the sister group to Opisthokonta. That is another major clade which contains both Fungi and Animals as well as some 300 species of unicellular protists. Amoebozoa and Opisthokonta are sometimes grouped together in a high-level taxon, variously named Unikonta, Amorphea, or Opimoda.
Amoebozoa includes many of the best-known amoeboid organisms, such as "Chaos", "Entamoeba", "Pelomyxa" and the genus "Amoeba" itself.
Most are unicellular, and are common in soils and aquatic habitats. Some are symbionts of other organisms, including several pathogens. The Amoebozoa also include the Myxozoan slime moulds, multinucleate or multicellular forms which produce spores and are usually visible to the unaided eye.
The nutrition is usually by phagocytosis. The cell surrounds food particles, sealing them into vacuoles where they are digested and absorbed. When food is scarce, most species form cysts, which may be carried by air to other places. In slime moulds, these structures are called spores, and form on stalked structures called fruiting bodies or sporangia.
Most Amoebozoa lack flagella and more generally do not form microtubule-supported structures except during mitosis. However, flagella occur among some archamoebae, and many slime moulds produce biflagellate gametes.
A characteristic form is the model organism "Dictyostelium discoideum".

Parazit (, "", meaning "static") was a weekly half-hour Persian language satirical television show on Voice of America's Persian service. The show is a satire about Iranian politics. Kambiz Hosseini and Saman Arbabi started the show as a 10-minute show. It was influenced by the American satirical news show "The Daily Show". Parazit was started before the June 2009 presidential elections in Iran. It became very popular in Iran. Many people watched it via illegal satellite dishes and internet. Its name comes from the Iranian government's repeated tries to jam foreign satellite programming. Because it is shown through unofficial channels, it is impossible to say how many people have seen it. However since January 2011, the show's YouTube channel is watched 45,000 times a week and its Facebook page is visited 17 million times a month.

Gibbs free energy

Gibbs free energy is the available energy in a chemical reaction. It was calculated by Josiah Willard Gibbs.
Systems want to achieve as low of a free energy state as possible. The Gibbs free energy number is how far away the current system is from this state. It is analogous to a number line, with zero being the final state. Scientists use Gibbs free energy to determine the energy in a system that can be used. A negative Gibbs number indicates that you can get energy out of the reaction. It is a favorable reaction, which means that the chemical "wants" to move towards its lower state. A positive Gibbs number shows that you must put energy in to get energy out.
An example can be seen in respiration. The Gibbs value of one mole of glucose -686kcal. This means that we can get 686 kcal of energy from one mole of glucose. This means if we put in energy in respiration, we can theoretically get 686 kcal out of the mole of glucose.
The equation for Gibbs free energy is "G(p,T)" = "U" + "pV" − "TS."
This is often simplified as "G(p,T)" = "H" − "TS."
(For the second equation, "U + pV" is replaced by "H" because "H = U + pV)."

Molar concentration

Molar concentration, or molarity, or simply concentration, is a term in physical chemistry. It measures the concentration of a solution or mixture.
In chemistry, the molar concentration, formula_1 is defined as the amount of a constituent formula_2 (usually measured in moles – hence the name) divided by the volume of the mixture formula_3:
The volume formula_3 in the definition formula_6 refers to the volume of the solution, "not" the volume of the solvent. One litre of a solution usually contains either slightly more or slightly less than 1 litre of solvent because when a substance dissolves in a solvent it causes volume of liquid to increase or decrease.
The reciprocal quantity represents the dilution (volume) which can appear in Ostwald's law of dilution.

Platypterygius

Platypterygius ('flat flipper)' is an ichthyosaur of the family Ophthalmosauridae. It was the last surviving ichthyosaur.
Fossils are known from Australia, Russia, United States of America, Colombia, Western Europe and possibly New Zealand. There are seven named species. Both adults and juveniles have been unearthed, including newborns and pregnant females. Like other ichthyosaurs, "Platypterygius" gave live birth.
"Platypterygius" reached a length of about 7 m (23 ft). It had a long snout and a powerful finned tail. There are more digits in the front flippers than is usual in ichthyosaurs; they are tightly bound in rows, giving a broad, flat appearance. This unusual characteristic gives the genus its name, meaning 'flat wing.' Furthermore, some of the wrist bones have disappeared entirely. CAT scans on a juvenile specimen strongly suggest that "Platypterygius" was deaf.
"Platypterygius" became extinct during the Upper Cretaceous, about 30 million years before the K/T extinction event. There was an ocean anoxic event at the Cenomanian–Turonian stage boundary. The deeper layers of the seas became anoxic and poisoned by hydrogen sulphide (HS). As life died off in the lower (benthos) levels of the sea, so did the predators at the top of the food chain. The last pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs became extinct. 
No firm reasons can be given for the decline of the ichthyosaurs. By the Cretaceous they certainly had more competitors than in the Triassic, and more elusive prey. The adaptive radiation of teleost fish meant their new prey were fast swimming and highly evasive. The teleosts also included fast-swimming predatory fish, which must have been competitors. This competition, and the ocean anoxic event, must have ended this last remaining line of ichthyosaurs.

Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing

The Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing (also known as the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge and Second Narrows Bridge) is the second bridge that crosses over the Burrard Inlet. It goes from Vancouver to north shore of Burrard Inlet (includes District of North Vancouver, the City of North Vancouver, and West Vancouver).
It began construction in 1957. On June 17, 1958, when one of the cranes was stretching from the north side of the bridge to join the two chords of the unfinished arch, several of the spans collapsed. This caused 79 workers to fall 30 metres (100 ft) into the water. 18 of them were killed either instantly or shortly after, possibly drowned by their heavy tool belts. When a diver went down to search for the bodies, he drowned and that brought the total of deaths for the collapse to 19. The bridge opened on August 25, 1960 and was renamed the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing in 1994 to honour the workers that had died in the collapse.

Château de Lunéville

The Château de Lunéville was the former royal residence of the ruling Dukes of Lorraine. It is often likened to the far grander and larger Palace of Versailles. It is no longer a royal residence and is today a museum. The restoration of the building and its decors is under way. In France it was referred to as the "Versailles of Lorraine" and is also sometimes referred to as the Palace of Lunéville in English.
A building had been on the site since medieval times but nothing had been done to improve or update the building due to the poor finances of the Duchy of Lorraine.
Duke Leopold I of Lorraine was married to Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans herself a niece of Louis XIV of France who at the time of their marriage in 1698 was beginning to expand the Palace of Versailles. The ducal family of Lorraine had previously used the Ducal Palace of Nancy itself in the capital of the duchy. The new Duke and duchess had an ever growing family and Leopold took it upon himself to commission another palace reflecting his rank as a sovereign duke.
Following the death of Leopold of Lorraine in 1729 the duchy was inherited by his son Francis Stephen who eventually married Empress Maria Theresa and he spent most of his time in Austria with his large family.
A after war between France, Poland and Austria apeace was concluded in October 1735 and upheld in the Treaty of Vienna in November 1738. Under its terms, Stanisław Leszczyński, the father-in-law of King Louis XV and the losing claimant to the Polish throne, received Lorraine, while Francis, in compensation for his loss, was made heir to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, which he would inherit in 1737. While the ex king of Poland was in residence the building was known as the "Château Stanislas". Stanisław Leszczyński actually died at the Château in 1766 as did his wife Catherine Opalińska in 1747. After the Polish royals left the Château was largely ignored until it was created a French Historic monument in 1901. It is currently being restored.

Delta-v, or Δ"v"," "(literally, the change in speed)" "in astrodynamics, (how spacecraft move in space) is a measure of the amount of effort (pushing power) needed to change a craft's trajectory (how it's going to move from now on) in space. It is measured by a unit of speed.
Most of the time, a propellant burned by an engine provides the needed thrust.
Delta-v is calculated in meters per second of thrust, or m/s. 
For example, to reach Low Earth orbit, (LEO) a spacecraft generally needs about 9,300 to 10,000 m/s of thrust.

Dijkstra's algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm that works on groups of things connected by distances. It finds the shortest ways to move from one first thing to each other thing in the graph. It is faster than many other ways to do this, but it needs all of the distances connecting the things to be zero or more.
When you have done all of these steps you can use the list to find the shortest way from the first thing to any other thing. First write down the other thing. Then keep doing these steps:
The connections between the things you have written down are the shortest way from the first thing to the other thing.

Plant breeding

Plant breeding is the art and science of changing the traits of plants to produce desired characteristics. Plant breeding can be done by many different techniques. Plants with desirable characteristics for propagation can be selected. More complex molecular techniques are also possible (see cultigen and cultivar).
Plant breeding has been practiced for thousands of years, since near the beginning of human civilization. It is now done worldwide by gardeners and farmers, or by professional plant breeders employed by government institutions, universities, crop-specific industry associations or research centres.
International development agencies believe that breeding new crops is important for preventing famine. New varieties are developed. They are higher-yielding, resistant to pests and diseases, drought-resistant or adapted to different environments and growing conditions.
Plant breeding started with the domestication of the first agricultural plants, a practice dates back 9,000 to 11,000 years. Initially early farmers simply selected food plants with particular desirable characteristics, and employed these as progenitors for subsequent generations, resulting in an accumulation of valuable traits over time.
Gregor Mendel's experiments with plant hybridization led to his establishing laws of inheritance. Once this work became well known, it formed the basis of the new science of genetics, which stimulated research by many plant scientists dedicated to improving crop production through plant breeding.
Modern plant breeding is applied genetics, but its scientific basis is broader, covering molecular biology, cytology, systematics, physiology, pathology, entomology, chemistry, and statistics (biometrics). It has also developed its own technology.

Hilbert's tenth problem

Hilbert's tenth problem is a problem in mathematics that is named after David Hilbert who included it in Hilbert's problems as a very significant problem in mathematics. It has to do with finding an algorithm that can solve any Diophantine equations. It has been proved that such an algorithm does not exist.
As with all problems included in Hilbert's problems, it was unresolved and considered very difficult when the famous list was published in 1900. The first significant step towards finding the solution was made in 1950 by Julia Robinson, who created a hypothesis (known as the JR hypothesis) around which all later progress revolved. The problem was finally solved with a negative answer in 1970 when Yuri Matiyasevich proved the JR hypothesis. Previous research had shown that this was enough for a negative answer to the problem. The negative answer means that we cannot make an algorithm that can solve any Diophantine equation.

Seti I

Menmaatre Seti I (or Sethos I as in Greek) was a pharaoh of the New Kingdom 19th Dynasty. He was the son of Ramesses I and Queen Sitre, and the father of Ramesses II. 
As with all dates in Ancient Egypt, the actual dates of his reign are unclear. Various historians claim different dates, with 1294 BC to 1279 BC and 1290 BC to 1279 BC being the most commonly used by scholars today.
The name 'Seti' means "of Set", which indicates that he was consecrated to the god Set (or "Seth"). As with most pharaohs, Seti had several names. Upon his ascension, he took the "prenomen" "mn-m3‘t-r‘ ", usually vocalized as "Menmaatre", in Egyptian, which means "Eternal is the Justice of Re." His better known nomen, or birth name, is transliterated as "sty mry-n-ptḥ" or "Sety Merenptah", meaning "Man of Set, beloved of Ptah". 
The greatest achievement of Seti I's foreign policy was the capture of the Syrian town of Kadesh and neighboring territory of Amurru from the Hittite Empire. Egypt had not held Kadesh since the time of Akhenaten. 
Seti I was successful in defeating a Hittite army that tried to defend the town. He entered the city in triumph together with his son Ramesses II and erected a victory stela at the site. Kadesh, however, soon reverted to Hittite control because the Egyptians did not or could not maintain a permanent military occupation of Kadesh and Amurru which were close to the Hittite homelands. 
The traditional view of Seti I's wars was that he restored the Egyptian empire after it had been lost in the time of Akhenaten. Recent scholarship, however, indicates that the empire was not lost at this time, except for its northern border provinces of Kadesh and Amurru in Syria and Lebanon. 
Seti I has left us an impressive war monument that glorifies his achievement, along with a number of texts, all of which tend to magnify his personal achievements on the battlefield.

The Crurotarsi are one of the two main groups of archosaurs. It includes the archosaurs (living today are crocodiles and birds). It also includes all their ancestors and relatives right back to the early Triassic period, including the Pseudosuchia.

<doc id="445249" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=445249" title="Pseudosuchia">
Pseudosuchia

Pseudosuchia ("false crocodiles") is one of two major divisions of archosaurs. It includes living crocodilians. It also includes archosaurs more closely related to crocodiles than to birds: "crocodile-line archosaurs". 
Pseudosuchia is one of the two "daughter" clades of the Archosauria. It includes a group of superficially crocodile-like prehistoric reptiles from the Triassic period. These are relatives of living crocodiles, but more distant than the archosaurs.
The skull is often massive. The snout is narrow and often long. The neck is short and strong. The standing position may be a typical reptilian sprawl. More often it is an erect stance like dinosaurs or mammals, though done a different way. The body is often protected by two or more rows of armored scutes. Many crurotarsans get to lengths of three metres or more.
Pseudosuchians appeared in the late Lower Triassic. By the late Middle Triassic they were the dominant land carnivores. Their great time was the Upper Triassic, during which time their ranks included a number of carnivore groups, and one group of herbivores.
The end Triassic extinction caused the extinction of most pseudosuchians. The ancestors of modern-day crocodiles survived. A study published in 2010 suggests volcanic eruptions changed the climate, causing a mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs' main competitors. Furthermore, this allowed the dinosaurs to succeed them as the dominant terrestrial carnivores and herbivores.
As the Mesozoic progressed, more typically crocodile-like forms evolved. Dinosaurs were the dominant animals on land, but the proto-crocodiles flourished in rivers, swamps, and the oceans. These early crocodiles had far more diversity they have today. With the end Cretaceous extinction, the dinosaurs became extinct, except the birds, while the crocodilians continued with little change. Today, the crocodiles, alligators, and gharials are the surviving representatives of this lineage.

Windburn

Windburn is when a person gets a sunburn but thought it was caused by wind because it was cloudy. Windburn is actually a sunburn rather than an actual condition caused by wind. This was shown as early as 1936 by English skin specialist Charles Howard White of Cambridge and American physicist William Henry Crew of New York University. However, it is still a common misconception that windburn is caused by wind.

Topsham is a town in Sagadahoc County, Maine, United States. Its population was 8,784 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area. Topsham is where the Topsham Fair happens every year.
The Pejepscot Abenaki Indians, a sub-tribe of the Anasagunticooks (now Androscoggins), used to own the land that is now Topsham. They called the this area "Sawacook." The Pejepscot Abenaki controlled the Androscoggin River. They lived and fished at Pejepscot Falls. But a plague, probably smallpox brought by Europeans, killed most of the tribe's population in 1615-1616.
On June 16, 1632, the Plymouth Council gave some land that had once belonged to the Abenaki to Thomas Purchase and George Way. The land was later given to Richard Wharton, and then in 1714 it was given to the Pejepscot Company.
The first sawmill there was built in 1716 on the Cathance River.
In 1717 the area got its current name, Topsham. It is named after the town of Topsham in Devon, England. On January 31, 1764, Topsham was incorporated as a town by the Massachusetts General Court.
Shipbuilding and lumber mills were important early businesses in Topsham. Pejepscot Falls provided the power to support industry. Lumber mills were very active between 1750 and 1770. Factories later produced things like lumber, watches, doors and pottery.
Topsham and Brunswick were connected with the Underground Railroad during the years of slavery. There were safe houses and underground tunnels to hide escaped slaves in both towns. </ref>http://www.curtislibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/FACTS-AND-LEGENDS-THE-UNDERGROUND-RR.pdf</ref>

The Nematophytes are a paraphyletic group of land organisms, probably including some plants as well as algae. They are known only from the fossil record, from the Silurian period until the early Devonian Rhynie chert. 
The lack of a clear definition of the nematophytes has led to it being used as a wastebasket taxon. All manner of tubes and cell-patterned cuticles from the Silurian are called "nematophytic".

Cloisonné

Cloisonné, a French word meaning "enclosed", is a metal-working technique. It is an ancient technique for decorating metalwork objects. The resulting objects can also be called "cloisonné". 
The decoration is formed by first adding compartments or cells to the metal object. This is done by soldering or sticking silver or gold wires or thin strips placed on edge. These are visible in the finished piece, separating the different compartments.
Coloured enamel is the usual filling for the cells. Cloisonné enamel objects are worked on with enamel powder made into a paste, which then is fired in a kiln. In older times inlays of cut gemstones were often used. 
The technique was in ancient times mostly used for jewellery and small fittings for clothes, weapons or similar small objects. They were decorated with geometric or schematic designs, with thick cloison walls. In the Byzantine Empire a technique with thinner wires were developed. This let pictorial images to be made. It was mostly used for religious images and jewellery, and by then always using enamel. By the 14th century this enamel technique had spread to China, where it was soon used for much larger vessels such as bowls and vases. The technique is common in China to the present day. Cloisonné enamel objects using Chinese-derived styles were produced in the West from the 18th century.
The earliest surviving cloisonné pieces are rings in graves from 12th century BC Cyprus, using very thin wire.

Hell Creek Formation

The Hell Creek Formation is a series of rocks where fossil dinosaurs are found. The strata are mostly Upper Cretaceous and some lower Paleocene rocks in North America. 
The name comes from Hell Creek, near Jordan, Montana. The formation includes portions of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. 
It is a series of fresh and brackish-water clays, mudstones, and sandstones deposited during the end of the Cretaceous period and the beginning of the Palaeogene. It was laid down by fluvial activity in river channels and deltas and occasional peaty swamp deposits. All this was along the low-lying eastern continental margin fronting the late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway. 
The climate was mild, and the presence of crocodilians suggests a sub-tropical climate, with no prolonged annual cold. The famous iridium-enriched Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary, which separates the Cretaceous from the Cenozoic, occurs as a distinct thin marker bedding above and occasionally within the formation, near its boundary with the overlying Fort Union Formation.
The world's largest collection of Hell Creek fossils is housed and exhibited at the Museum of the Rockies, in Bozeman, Montana. The specimens displayed are the result of the museum's Hell Creek Project, a joint effort between the museum, Montana State University, the University of California, Berkeley, the University of North Dakota and the University of North Carolina which began in 1998.
The fossils discovered include all types of late Cretceous dinosaurs, fish, amphibia, mammals (Multituberculates, Metatheria and Eutheria), and other reptiles turtles, crocodylomorphs, squamata (snakes & lizards).

Rolf Harris

Rolf Harris, (born 30 March 1930) is an Australian musician, singer-songwriter, composer, painter, actor, former television personality and former swimmer. He is in prison for sexually assaulting girls.
Harris was born in Wembley Park, Perth, Western Australia. His parents were Welsh and emigrated from Cardiff to Australia. Rolf Harris was a student at Perth Modern School from 1943 to 1947 and gained a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Western Australia. He has lived in the United Kingdom since 1953. He lived in Bray, Berkshire, England until he was sent to prison. He has been married to Welsh sculptress and jeweller Alwen Hughes since 1958. They have a daughter, Bindi (born 1964).
Harris began his television career on the BBC in 1953. He is best known for his art television shows such as "Rolfin bed", "Rolf's Cartoon Club" and "Animal Hospital". In 2005, he painted an official portrait of Queen Elizabeth II in his bed. His best known songs are "Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport" (1957) and "Jake the Peg" (1965). He also appeared on children's show The Wiggles on their It's a Wiggly Wiggly World! video in 2000 with his song "Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport" which was also once a major hit in Australia, the UK and the US.
In 2013, Harris was arrested under Operation Yewtree, which was set up to investigate complaints of sexual assault by television personality and paedophile Jimmy Savile, who died on 29 October 2011. Harris appeared on advertisements for British Paints which is an Australian brand of paint. He no longer appears on these adverts.
Later that year, Harris was charged with twelve counts of having indecent assaulted girls aged 7 to 19 during the 1960s and 1980s. After his computer was seized by police, he was also charged with four counts of making indecent images of a child during 2012. Harris was interviewed and cautioned by police on November 2012. His trial was due to begin in London on 30 April 2014 but was postponed to 6 May 2014. He says he is innocent, denying all wrongdoing. He has also refused to speak to the media and his defence lawyer has said that he will plead not guilty to all of the charges. While awaiting trial on 15 January 2014 when he appeared in a London court with his family, supporters and his security guards, it was decided that Harris would be bailed to stay at his home with his wife until the time when trial starts. He was not allowed to go near anyone under 18 or to contact any of the witnesses. He denied any wrongdoing. Harris' trial began at Southwark Crown Court on 6 May 2014. At the trial it was revealed that Harris was a 'Jekyll and Hyde' character, whose immense talent and public generosity to children and animals hid a darker side - he was sexually attracted to young girls. On 19 June 2014, the jury in the Rolf Harris trial retired to consider its verdict. On 30 June 2014, Harris was found guilty on all 12 counts of indecent assault making him the second person to be convicted under Operation Yewtree after Max Clifford. On 4 July 2014, Harris was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison and is currently incarcerated at HM Prison Wandsworth and later he will be transferred to HM Prison Littlehey. The sentence was later referred to the Attorney General for England and Wales Dominic Grieve after complaints it was too lenient. On 30 July 2014, the new Attorney General, Jeremy Wright, announced that he would not be referring the sentence to the court of appeal for review "as he did not think they would find it to be unduly lenient and increase it. The sentencing judge was bound by the maximum sentence in force at the time of the offending."
Harris was stripped of his BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award after his conviction. Alison Pink (now Steven George since a sex reassignment) who says that he was abused by Jimmy Savile while a woman said that he (then she) once witnessed Rolf Harris visiting Broadmoor Hospital with Savile and they turned up at a woman's ward just as patients were preparing to get undressed in the corridor.
When Harris was convicted his hometown of Bassendean in Perth voted to remove his artwork from their council chambers and to strip him off his status as a Freeman of the town.

The Athenian women planted the "garden of Adonis" where the seeds would spring to life and then die to be reborn a few months later.

Tenerife airport disaster

The Tenerife airport disaster happened on March 27, 1977, when two Boeing 747s collided on the ground of Los Rodeos Airport (now Tenerife North Airport). This crash killed 583 people onboard the two flights.
The crash was caused by many reasons. One reason is that as the KLM captain wanted to takeoff quickly so that he could return to Amsterdam. This made him misunderstand that he was cleared by Air Traffic Controller to takeoff and so he began to take off, eventually crashing into the Pan Am flight. At that time, the Tenerife North Airport did not have ground radar, so the controllers could not know that the KLM flight was taking off.
Another reason was the fog surrounding the airport. The bad weather reduced the visibility, meaning the pilots could not see each other and neither could the controllers see the two planes on the runway. Because of the fog, the pilots only saw each other at the last minute, when they could not have prevented the crash. If there was no fog, the KLM crew would have seen the Pan Am plane on the runway and would not have taken off.
It was the worst crash in the history of aviation.

The company offers the Fantasy Bra for sale as "the ultimate holiday" gift. But only the fantasy bras from the 2004 Heavenly "70" Fantasy Bra and the 2012 Floral Fantasy Bra and Gift Set have found buyers. If not bought, the bras are taken apart after a year.
Heidi Klum and Adriana Lima have worn the Fantasy Bra in three different years. Gisele Bündchen, Tyra Banks, Karolína Kurková, and Alessandra Ambrosio have each worn two Fantasy Bras.
The $15 million price tag for the 2000 bra worn by Gisele Bündchen earned a place in the "Guinness World Records" as the most expensive item of lingerie ever created. The $3 million 2009 Harlequin Fantasy Bra and the $2 million 2010 Bombshell Fantasy Bra were designed by Damiani. Listed below are the prices per set (including accessories for the 2007 and 2013 editions, the 2013 bra alone is worth $8,000,000).

Head tax (Canada)

The Chinese head tax was a fixed fee charged to each Chinese person entering Canada. The head tax was first levied after the Canadian parliament passed the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885. It was meant to discourage Chinese people from entering Canada after the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The tax was abolished by the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923. That act stopped all Chinese immigration except for business people, clergy, educators, students, and other categories.

Key Management Service

KMS (Key Management Service) is one of the methods to activate Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office. Activation ensures that the software is obtained from and licensed by Microsoft. KMS is used by volume license customers, usually medium to large businesses, schools, and non-profits. Individual computers do not need to contact Microsoft, although the KMS server does. KMS clients must be activated at least once every 180 days. A KMS client will try to activate once every 7 days, and if it fails it will try again every 2 hours. The KMS server can be automatically detected by DNS if the proper DNS record is present, or it can be manually entered using the "slmgr" command. There must be at least 25 KMS-activated computers (5 for Windows Server) on the network to use KMS. If the KMS activation fails (for example, because the KMS server is not available or there are less than 25 computers on the network), a watermark telling the user to activate Windows will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen.
There is an unofficial KMS server emulator that will activate Windows or Office even if the software was not licensed or paid for, and regardless of whether or not there are 25 or more computers on the network. There is also a program that will send KMS requests to a legitimate KMS server, in order to fool the server into thinking that there are 25 or more computers on the network. Microsoft considers both of these exploits to be a violation of the Terms and Conditions.

<doc id="446000" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=446000" title="Suicide risk assessment">
Suicide risk assessment

A suicide risk assessment (SRA) is used to decide an individual's suicide risk (how likely they are to kill themselves). This is a very important first step in helping a person who is thinking of killing themselves. It is best done by a mental health professional, like a counselor. A good, complete risk assessment can lead to a person getting the treatment and help they need, which can reduce or end suicidal symptoms. 
The first part of an SRA is talking to a doctor - or other trained mental health worker - who asks specific questions about what the person is thinking about, how they feel, and what is going on in their life. (This is called a clinical interview).
The second part of the SRA uses one or more tests that have been proven to measure suicide risk. These tests are called "scales." A scale is a way of measuring something. Some of these scales have been shown to be very reliable, such as the Suicidal Affect-Behavior-Cognition Scale (SABCS) and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).
A suicide risk assessment is not always completely right about a person's suicide risk. Still, usually it gives a risk score that is helpful for making important decisions about what treatment the person needs. 
The risk of suicide may change over time. It may become higher or lower for different reasons. For example, treatment (like counseling or medicines) may work, making the person feel better, or not work. Or the person's life may change in good or bad ways (for example, they may get or lose a job, go to a new school, get a boyfriend or girlfriend, or break up with one).
Because the risk of suicide can change over time, the suicide risk assessment has to be done more than once while the person is in treatment. If the person is in the hospital for treatment, it has to be done before they are sent home.
A suicide risk assessment can be important in helping save the life of a suicidal person. But an article in a journal called "Suicide & Life-Threatening Behavior", written in 2012, says that SRAs are often not done, and that many mental health care workers have little or no training in how to do a suicide risk assessment.
Hospitals, doctors, and counselors can be sued for negligible death if a suicidal person goes to them for help, but they never did a suicide risk assessment. Negligible death means that the hospital, doctor, or counselor did not do something they were supposed to do, and because of that, a person died.
Recent self-harm can also provide clues to a person's suicide risk. When a person hurts himself or herself on purpose, this is called self-harm (or self-injury). For example, important questions to ask might include:
If the same events, thoughts, feelings, and other things that led up to the self-harm happen again, the person may be more likely to self-harm again, or to commit suicide.12
When patients ask for help or even harm themselves, they still have rights. Sometimes, suicide risk assessments can bring up patients' rights issues. They can also create a conflict between the rights of the patient, and the powers of doctors, mental health professionals, and the law.
For example, many state laws in the United States say that a person can be forced to go to the hospital, even if they do not want to go, if a doctor or mental health professional says they are suicidal. In some states, the person can be physically restrained (for example, tied to a hospital bed) if they try to leave the hospital. Some states also allow paramedics and doctors to give chemical restraints (medicines to make the person cooperate or be very tired), even if the patient does not want these medicines.
If after a short stay in the hospital (usually 3 business days), the hospital believes the person is still a risk to themselves, they can ask a court for "civil commitment". If a judge agrees, the judge will order the person to stay in the hospital for a much longer time (usually months). The person has no right to leave the hospital.
This means that in many cases, if a doctor or mental health professional says a person is suicidal, that person can lose:
In the case of people who may be suicidal, the law sees the powers of doctors and mental health professionals as more important than the rights of the patient.

Oddworld Inhabitants

Oddworld Inhabitants is the name of a company that publishes games that are set on the Oddworld universe. It was founded in 1994 by Lorne Lanning and Sherry McKenna. The company has been known for creating the Oddworld Quintology and that is to be finished. It is best known for it's four Oddworld games that were released from 1997 to 2005. The games include: Oddworld Abe's Oddysee, Oddworld Abe's Exoddus, Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee and Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath as well as two Gameboy and one Gameboy Advance games that were short versions of Abe's Oddysee, Abe's Exoddus and Munch's Oddysee. They were titled: Oddworld Adventures, Oddworld Adventures II and Munch's Oddysee. 
In 2005, Oddworld Inhabitants took a break from making video games. They ended up going into film industry and the company were planned to make a plannet like Oddworld called Citizen Siege.
The company are now back into making video games with help from a video game development company called Just Add Water (Developments) UK LTD. They only sell digital products as of 2008 when the original PC games went up on Steam. They also made available the original PS1 games on the Playstation Network store in 2010 for the PS3 and PSP. The classics were made avaliable for PS Vita in August 2012. They started work by porting the original Xbox version of Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath to PC. They then made an HD version and had several improvements made to it and it was released in 2011 for the PC and PS3. In 2012 Oddworld announced that Abe's Oddysee was getting a completely re-made game from the ground up and it's title which was chosen by fans is called Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty. They also released Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee HD for PS3 in December 2012. 
In 2013, it was announced that New 'n' Tasty will be coming Spring 2014 and at the Game Developers Conference in California, they announced it was coming soon. 
The developers originally stated that the "Oddworld" series would consist of five games referred to as the Quintology. Only two of those five games have been produced, while two additional games from the same universe were developed as expansion titles outside of the Quintology. Production on the Quintology's final three games was halted when the company decided to redirect its efforts toward film production. Those plans, too, were shelved. In 2009, a partnership was created with developers Just Add Water to continue developing the abandoned video games with Oddworld Inhabitants Inc. becoming the publisher of the titles. In order to raise the money to fund the rest of the Quintology, Just Add Water began by porting the studio's first two titles to new consoles and producing high definition remasters of "Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee" and "Stranger's Wrath". A high definition rebuild of "Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee" subtitled "New 'n' Tasty!" was next. Stewart Gilray has confirmed that all five Quintology games are titled Oddworld: X's Oddysee where X is the name of the protagonist.

Rapetosaurus

Rapetosaurus is a genus of sauropod dinosaur. It lived in what is now Madagascar from 70 to 66 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period. Only one species, "Rapetosaurus krausei", has been found. Like other sauropods, "Rapetosaurus" was a quadrupedal herbivore.
The discovery of "Rapetosaurus" was the first time a titanosaur had been recovered with an almost perfectly intact skeleton, complete with skull. It has helped to clarify some difficult issues in this large group of sauropod dinosaurs. It provides a baseline for the reconstruction of other titanosaurs that are known only from partial remains.
By the early part of the Upper Cretaceous all sauropods, except the titanosaurs, were extinct. The titanosaurs were the dominant herbivores of the Upper Cretaceous on the southern continents which made up Gondwana. Their reign was cut short by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.
The specimen discovered was a juvenile. It is 8 metres (26 ft) from head to tail, and "probably weighed about as much as an elephant", according to Kristina Curry Rogers. An adult would have been about twice as long (15 metres (49 ft) in length), which is still less than half the length of its gigantic kin, like "Argentinosaurus" and "Paralititan".

Aularches miliaris

Aularches miliaris is a grasshopper found in south and southeast Asia. It is protected by powerful chemical defences, and its warning colour signals its foul taste.
When it is disturbed or grabbed, it makes a sharp rasping noise with its thoracic segments. Then, if its thorax is pinched, it gives off a toxic foam. It squirts a clear viscous mucus with unpleasant smell and a bitter taste, faintly alkaline, with many bubbles. This foam comes out as a strong jet from openings in the thorax, and more gently from other openings in the body (ten in total). The foam heaps up around the insect and partly covers it.
The head and thorax are dark green with a canary-yellow band on the side. The leathery front wings are green with many yellow spots; the legs are blue, with a yellow serrated pattern on the hind legs. The abdomen is black with bright red bands. 
Like most noxious animals, it is very visible and slow-moving on vegetation. It pays to advertise, and it does not need to hide.

The new name Outlander was chosen because it suggested a "feeling of journeying to distant, unexplored lands in search of adventure."

Camelops

Camelops is an extinct genus of camel which lived in North America during the Pleistocene. from two million years ago to about 10,000 years ago.
They were prey for the wolves, bears, lions and "Smilodon". "Camelops" disappeared at the end of the last ice age, as did many other animals.
Evidence of its environment comes from Natural Trap Cave in Wyoming, and from Rancho La Brea in the modern Los Angeles area. These studies suggest that it was not, like modern camels, adapted to desert conditions. It lived in woodland and grasslands with mixed vegetation.
Before the climate change at about 11,000 years ago it lived in "conifer parklands" on the Montana-Wyoming border, and in "coastel shrublands" in California. After the climate change, what had been woodland became "deserts and treeless steppes of the sort so extensive in the present western U.S.A". Even the type of grass which grew there changed.
Evidently, for this animal, the climate change was very significant. Also, the arrival of man as a hunter may have made the situation worse. A few Clovis points have been found in the cave site.

Steppe wisent

The steppe bison, or steppe wisent ("Bison priscus"), is an extinct bison. It lived on steppes in Europe, Central Asia, Beringia, and North America during the Quaternary. It is believed that it evolved somewhere in South Asia, That would mean it appeared at about the same time and region as the aurochs, with which its descendants are sometimes confused.
The steppe wisent became extinct in the Pleistocene. It was replaced in Europe by the modern wisent species. It was replaced in America by "Bison latifrons", then later "Bison antiquus"), and finally the modern American bison.
Steppe wisent occasionally appear in cave painting. They are in the famous Cave of Altamira and Lascaux. They have also been found in naturally ice-preserved form.

Pinwheel galaxy

The Pinwheel galaxy (Messier 101, M101 or NGC 5457) is a face-on spiral galaxy in the constellation of Ursa Major, the Great Bear.
The galaxy is 21 million light-years (six megaparsecs) away from us. It was first discovered by Pierre Méchain on 27 March 1781. Charles Messier verified its position and included it in the "Messier Catalogue" as one of the last entries.
In 2006, NASA and the ESA released a very detailed image of the Pinwheel Galaxy, which was the largest and most detailed image of a galaxy by Hubble Space Telescope at the time. The image was composed from 51 individual exposures, plus some extra ground-based photos.
On 24 August 2011, a Type Ia supernova, SN 2011fe, was discovered in M101.
A remarkable property of this galaxy is its huge and extremely bright H II regions, of which about 3,000 can be seen on photographs. H II regions have numbers of short-lived blue stars formed from clouds of high density molecular hydrogen. These regions give off huge amounts of ultraviolet light that ionizes the surrounding gas. 
The galaxy contains ULX-1 (an ultra-luminous X-ray source), which is a relatively small black hole, just 20 to 30 times the mass of our Sun.

Bittern

Bitterns are waterbirds, living mostly in freshwater sites. They are a type of heron, wading birds in the family Ardeidae. They are shorter-necked, and more secretive than other herons. Most of them have good camouflage amongst the reeds where they make their nests.
Bitterns form a monophyletic subfamily of the herons, the Botaurinae.
Bitterns usually frequent reedbeds and similar marshy areas, and feed on amphibians, reptiles, insects, and fish. Unlike the similar storks, ibises, and spoonbills, herons and bitterns fly with their necks retracted, not outstretched.
They were called "hæferblæte" in Old English; the word "bittern" came to English from Old French. 
Bitterns are in three genera. The genus "Ixobrychus" contains mainly small species. The genus "Botaurus" has the larger bitterns. There is a single species in a third genus, "Zebrilus". The distribution of bitterns is pretty much worldwide.

Behavioral economics

Behavioral economics is a smaller part of economics that combines what we know about psychology with what we know about economics. Normally, economics does not consider the way humans actually think, but instead, simplifies decision-making to make economic models easier to understand. However, this is not a complete picture of how the world, and economics, really works. Normally, economists assume people are rational, meaning they make good decisions at the right times using all information. In real life, people do not do this. They are subject to problems with self-control, problems with time, and make different choices depending on how decisions are presented to them. Behavioral economists look at the world given problems and limitations that result when real humans are faced with decisions.
The study of behavioral economics really began to develop in the middle and towards the end of the 20th century. Psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman wrote a paper called “Prospect Theory,” which was about how the way choices are presented to somebody is just as important as the choices themselves when an individual is making a decision. Later, Hersh Shefrin and Richard Thaler created a savings model which explains how people do not figure out how much to save and spend to stay at a constant level. People would rather spend more now, because humans prefer gratification in the near future. By 1994, Harvard University hired a professor to teach behavioral economics as its own subject. Now, behavioral economics helps explain many complex things that people do. There are many applications of the research, such as how to make public policy more effective or marketing and advertising applications. Also, there are other areas of study branching off from behavioral economics, like behavioral finance, which deals with how people make investments.
Behavioral economics can explain many different kinds of human actions. Some of the topics within the field are:
Loss aversion/Prospect Theory: People are made more upset by losses than they are made happy by gains of the same amount. This is important for how people think about taking risks. Related is the disposition effect, which is closely related to behavioral finance. The disposition effect is the tendency for investors to hold onto losing stocks too long, and sell winning ones too soon. This concept relates to loss aversion, since the investors are putting off making their losses a reality. Also related is the behavioral economic concept of “status quo bias.” This explains that, against what economics would expect, people seem to like their current state more than any other state they see as different.
Mental Accounting: People have separate mental accounts when it comes to spending and saving. Each mental account has a different degree of willingness to spend connected to it, and people assign activities to mental accounts 
Anchoring/ Status Quo Bias: When given an option automatically, people tend to want to stay with that choice, whether or not that choice is what should be best for them.
Unbounded Selfishness: People are mostly driven by self-interest, and will act in a way which produces the best outcome for themselves.
Unbounded Willpower: Individuals lack self-control. Even when they know what is in their best interest, they tend to act otherwise. People are also somewhat aware of their limited willpower.
Now that behavioral economics is growing in popularity, and more social scientists are researching the topic, ways to apply ideas are becoming more common. If framing a choice a certain way will “nudge,” or push, someone to make a better decision, those who are in charge of creating options can use this to produce a better outcome. These outcomes can range from increasing physical activity to decreasing obesity and changing eating habits, to lessening energy use or to reshaping government policies. In the future, the hope is that through small changes, the public will receive large-scale benefits. In Denmark, the Danish government is employing the concept of anchoring to increase the amount of drivers who are organ donors. In the United States, the White House has hired Cass Sunstein, a behavioral economist, to help guide policymakers. Richard Thaler also works in the US Cabinet on the new Behavioral Insight Team. The U.S., as well as Britain, has considered the idea of default options helping increase retirement savings.
One of the biggest arguments economists have against behavioral economics is that much of its research comes from small-scale research data, instead of real world sources. In addition, a lot of behavioral economic researchers use college students in their studies. College students have less experience than normal individuals. Since this population is a poor representation of an average person, data might show different results than it should.
Some psychologists argue that while behavioral economics is a step in the right direction in explaining why people act they way that they do, it is still far behind in research. They feel that it just changed traditional neoclassical economic theory, when they need to look deeper as to what is actually going on a more psychological and intellectual level.

Palaeoclimatology

Palaeoclimatology (or palaeoclimatology) is the study of changes in climate over the entire history of Earth. Modern interest in climate change has caused a great increase in the climates of the past.
The climates of the past can only be studied by proxy. Data is got from rocks, sediments, ice and tree rings, corals, shells and microfossils. These records are used to work out the past states of the Earth's climate and its atmospheric system.
Studies of past changes in the life and ecosystems of the past may throw a light on the present. An example is the effect of climate on mass extinctions and the recovery of life after those extinctions.
Knowledge of precise climatic events decreases as the record goes further back in time. Some notable climate events:

Sesame Workshop

Sesame Workshop is a company established in 1968. It was called Children's Television Workshop (CTW) until 2000. The Workshop is an American non-profit organization for the research and production of educational children's programs.
The Workshop oversaw the production of "Sesame Street", a television show for pre-school children from low-income families. Two years were spent, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new show. It was called "one of the most important television developments of the decade".
"Sesame Street" premiered on PBS in the United States in November 1969. 
Co-founder Joan Ganz Cooney said of the CTW model: "From the beginning, we—the planners of the project—designed the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers, researchers, and television producers collaborating as equal partners". She described the collaboration as an "arranged marriage".
Cooney's proposal included using "in-house formative research". This would inform and improve production. Independent evaluations tested the show's impact on its young viewers' learning.
Gerald S. Lesser and Edward L. Palmer were hired to do research for the show. Lesser and Palmer were the only scientists in the U.S. studying children and television at the time. They were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later called the "CTW model".
After "Sesame Street"s initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival. Their funding sources were organizations that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Government funding ended by 1981. 
The CTW expanded into other areas, including the publications of books and music, international co-productions, interactive media and new technologies, licensing arrangements, and outreach programs to preschools. By 2005, income from the CTW's international co-productions of the show was $96 million. By 2008, the "Sesame Street" Muppets accounted for $15–17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees.

<doc id="446898" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=446898" title="Megaflood">
Megaflood

A megaflood is a flood which suddenly releases a huge amount of water. In geomorphology it is sometimes called an outburst flood. At the end of the last ice age, many large floods were caused by the collapse of ice sheets or glaciers which formed the dams of glacial lakes. 
Examples of older outburst floods are known from the geological past of the Earth. Landslides, lahars, and volcanic dams can block rivers and create lakes. When the rock or earth barrier collapses, or is eroded, this triggers floods. Lakes also form behind glacial moraines, which can collapse and create outburst floods.
It is claimed that a rising sea flood led to refilling of the freshwater glacial Black Sea with water from the Aegean. It is described as "a violent rush of salt water into a depressed fresh-water lake in a single catastrophe that has been the inspiration for the flood mythology". 
The marine incursion was caused by the rising level of the Mediterranean about 7,600 years ago. It is the subject of debate among geologists. The existence of the flood is not certain, and the theory that it was the basis for later flood myths is not proven.
A theory proposed by Andrey Tchepalyga of the Russian Academy of Sciences dates the flooding of the Black Sea basin to an earlier time and from a different cause. According to Tchepalyga, global warming beginning from about 16,000 years ago caused the melting of the Scandinavian ice sheet. This caused a massive river discharge which flowed into the Caspian Sea. The Caspian basin could not contain all the floodwater, which flowed into the ancient Black Sea basin. This would have flooded large areas that were previously settled or used for hunting. Tchepalyga suggests this may have formed the basis for legends of the great Deluge.
Originally there was an isthmus across the Strait of Dover. During an earlier glacial maximum, the exit from the North Sea was blocked to the north by an ice dam, and the water flowing out of rivers backed up into a vast lake on the bed of what is now the North Sea. A gently upfolding chalk ridge linked the Weald of Kent and Artois, perhaps some 30 metres (100 feet) higher than the current sea level. 
At some time, probably around 425,000 years ago, and again around 225,000 years later, the barrier failed.
This let loose a catastrophic flood which diverted the Rhine into the English Channel and separated Britain from the continent of Europe. A sonar study of the sea bed of the English Channel showed unmistakable signs of a megaflood on the English Channel seabed.
A catastrophic flood refilled the Mediterranean Sea 5.3 million years ago. The flood occurred when Atlantic waters found their way through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean basin, which was then a salt lake and salt bed.
In North America during glacial maximum, there were no Great Lakes as we know them. but "proglacial" (ice-frontage) lakes formed and shifted. The most famous of these proglacial lakes was Lake Agassiz. Melting ice caused a series of great floods from Lake Agassiz. Massive amounts of freshwater was added to the world's oceans.
The last of the North American proglacial lakes, north of the present Great Lakes, reached its largest volume around 8,500 years ago, when joined with Lake Agassiz. But its outlet was blocked by the great wall of the glaciers and it drained by tributaries, into the Ottawa and St. Lawrence Rivers far to the south. About 8,300 to 7,700 years ago, the ice-dam failed catastrophically. Lake Ojibway's beach terraces show that it was above sea level. The volume of Lake Ojibway is estimated to have been about 163,000 cubic kilometres, more than enough water to cover a flattened-out Antarctica with a sheet of water deep. That volume was added to the world's oceans in a matter of months.
The detailed timing and rates of change after the onset of melting of the great ice-sheets are subjects of continuing study.
A landslide dam on Sichuan's Dadu River burst and caused a flood on 10 June 1786. The flood extended 1400 km downstream and killed 100,000 people. This was one of the worst landslide-related disasters in history.

A major general (or two-star general) is a rank in an army. It is between the ranks of lieutenant general and brigadier general. A major general usually commands a division. It comes from the older rank of sergeant major general. The disappearance of the "sergeant" in the title explains the apparently confusing system whereby a lieutenant general outranks a major general (although a major outranks a lieutenant, a lieutenant outranks a sergeant-major.) A Major general is addressed as "general".

Caledonian orogeny

The Caledonian orogeny was a mountain building era which left its mark in the northern parts of the British Isles, the Scandinavian Mountains, Svalbard, eastern Greenland and parts of north-central Europe.
The events occurred from the Ordovician to early Devonian, roughly 490390 million years ago (mya). It was caused by the closure of the Iapetus Ocean when the continents and lands of Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia collided.
The Caledonian orogeny is named after Caledonia, the Latin name for Scotland. The name is not used for an absolute period of time: it applies only to the series of mountain-building events.
Part of the mountain chain ended up in modern North America, where it is called the Acadian orogeny.
The Caledonian orogeny was one of several orogenies that would eventually form the supercontinent Pangaea later in the Palaeozoic era. The main phase of the Caledonian orogeny happened from about 425 to 395 million years ago.
Continental collision started in the mid Silurian, and mountain building took place in the early Devonian (from 407 million years ago onward).

Following is a 1998 British drama thriller movie directed by Christopher Nolan. It stars Jeremy Theobald, Alex Haw, Lucy Russell, and John Nolan. It was released on September 12, 1998. This was Christopher Nolan's first movie. It tells the story of a young man who follows strangers around the streets of London and is drawn into a criminal underworld when he fails to keep his distance.
As Christopher Nolan's debut feature, it was designed to be as inexpensive as possible to make: scenes were heavily rehearsed so that just one or two takes were needed, thus economising on 16 mm film stock, the production's greatest expense, and for which Nolan was paying from his salary. Without expensive professional lighting equipment, Nolan mostly used available light. Apart from writing, directing, and photographing the film, Nolan also helped in editing and production.Instead of fighting against the limitations of the production, Christopher Nolan allowed them to dictate everything from the film’s structure, to its handheld shooting style, to the 16mm film it was shot on.. to black-and-white stock and setting the scene during the day and place the characters next to windows or in natural sunlight as much as possible. Nolan has explained it in a detailed interview with VICE.

Harry Brearley

Harry Brearley (18 February 1871 – 14 July 1948) was an English metallurgist who invented stainless steel, that is, steel which does not rust.
Brearley was born in Sheffield, England, the son of a steelworker and his wife. He left Woodside School at the age of twelve to enter as a labourer in his father's steelworks. Later he got the post of general assistant in the company's chemical laboratory.
For several years, in addition to his laboratory work, he studied to specialize in steel production techniques and related chemical analysis methods.
In 1908, two of Sheffield's principal steelmaking companies agreed to jointly finance a common research laboratory (Brown Firth Laboratories). Harry Brearley was asked to lead the project.
After leaving Brown Firth, Brearley joined Brown Bayley's Steel Works, also in Sheffield. He became a director of the firm in 1925.
In 1941 Brearley created a charitable trust The Freshgate Trust Foundation, a grantmaking charity operating in Sheffield and South Yorkshire.
In the troubled years immediately before World War I, arms manufacturing increased greatly in the UK. There were problems due to erosion (excessive wear) of the internal surfaces of gun barrels. Brearley began to research new steels which could better resist the erosion caused by high temperatures. He began to add chromium to steel, which was known to raise the material’s melting point, as compared to the standard carbon steels.
The research concentrated on quantifying the effects of varying the levels of carbon (C, at concentrations around 0.2 weight %) and chromium (Cr, in the range of 6 to 15 weight %).
In order to do examine the alloys, a metal sample is treated. For a carbon steel, a dilute solution of nitric acid in alcohol is sufficient to produce the required effect. Brearley found that the new chromium steels were very resistant to chemical attack.
Up to that time carbon-steel knives rusted if they were not polished. Only expensive sterling silver or EPNS cutlery avoided the problem. With this in mind, Brearley tested his chromiun steel with food acids such as vinegar and lemon juice. The results were very promising. 
At first, Brearley called the new alloy "rustless steel". The better-sounding "stainless steel" was suggested by Ernest Stuart, a local cutlery manufacturer. 
The first true stainless steel, a 0.24wt% C, 12.8wt% Cr ferrous alloy, was produced by Brearley in an electric furnace on 13 August 1913. He was subsequently awarded the Iron and Steel Institute's Bessemer Gold Medal in 1920. The American Society for Metals gives the date for Brearley's creation of casting number 1008 (12.8% chromium, 0.44% manganese, 0.2% silicon, 0.24% carbon and 85.32% iron) as 20 August 1913.
Almost all research projects into stainless steels were interrupted by the 1914–18 War. The work was taken up again in the 1920s. Brearley had left the Brown Firth Laboratories in 1915, but the research continued under the direction of his successor, Dr. W. H. Hatfield. It is Hatfield who is credited with the development, in 1924, of a stainless steel which even today is probably the widest-used alloy of this type, the so-called "18/8", which in addition to chromium, includes nickel (Ni) in its composition (18wt% Cr, 8wt% Ni).

California Über Alles

"California Über Alles" is the first single off American hardcore punk band Dead Kennedys' debut studio album "Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables". The song was released in June 1979. 
The lyrics for the song were written by lead singer Jello Biafra and John Greenway for their band, The Healers. Biafra composed the music during one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.
The song is about Jerry Brown, the Governor of California from 1975-1983 (and later 2011–present). It is sung from his perspective, as a fictional version of Brown shapes a hippie-fascist vision for America. The title is a reference to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany, which began with the words "Deutschland, Deutschland über alles" (literally: "Germany, Germany above all").
The song appeared in the video games Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and the Rock Band series.

Bryan Wallace Berard (born March 5, 1977) is a American retired professional ice hockey defenceman. Berard played a total of 619 games in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played with the Columbus Blue Jackets, Chicago Blackhawks, Boston Bruins, New York Rangers, Toronto Maple Leafs, and New York Islanders.
Before playing in the NHL, Berard played 1 season with the Detroit Junior Red Wings and 1 seasons with the Detroit Whalers of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). He was drafted with the 1st overall pick by the Ottawa Senators in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft.
Berard is best known for a game he played on March 11, 2000 where he was clipped in the right eye by Senators' Marian Hossa and had his sclera slashed. This resulted in both a retinal tear and a detached retina. Berard was told that he might have to lose his eye. During the next season, Berard had over 7 eye operations. The operations left him with 20/600 in his damaged eye. He would later be fitted with a contact lens which allowed him to meet the league's minimum vision requirement of 20/400. He was awarded the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for his ability to "overcome an injury that left him legally blind in one eye" in 2004.
In early 2006, it was announced that Berard had tested positive for an anabolic steroid which was known as 19-Norandrosterone, in a drug test that he took in November 2005. Berard became the first NHL player to ever test positive for steroids. He said in a statement: "I made a mistake that resulted in a suspension and, while unintentional, I take full responsibility. I became aware of this problem after the fact, and for that I am disappointed in myself." He retired from playing professional ice hockey in 2009.
On November 13, 2013, Berard along with ex-police officer John Kaiser, helped catch two con artists that were conspiring to steal $15 million from NHL players as well as many Long Island police officers and their families.

The Algarve (from "al-Gharb" "the West") is the southernmost region of continental Portugal. The capital of the Algarve is the city of Faro. There is an international airport and a public university (University of Algarve).
The present region of Algarve coincides with the old province of the same name and with the Faro district. The main economic activity in the region is tourism because its beaches and its historical buildings.
The name Algarve comes from "Gharb Al-Andalus" (, "gharb al-ʼandalus"; "The West of Al-Andalus"), or just Al-Gharb (, "al-gharb"; "The West"), the name given by the Muslims of Iberia to the region to the west of Andalusia.
Algarve has an area of . It borders with the Alentejo region (Alentejo Litoral and Baixo Alentejo subregions) to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south, and the Guadiana river, and Andalusia (Spain), to the east.
The Algarve region is divided in two zones, each with eight municipalities:
The main mountain ranges are "Serra de Monchique", la "Serra de Espinhaço de Cão" and "Serra do Caldeirão". The highest point in the region is the Fóia mountain, high, in the "Serra de Monchique" mountain range.

<doc id="447328" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=447328" title="Ground beetle">
Ground beetle

Ground beetles are the Carabidae, a large, cosmopolitan family of beetles. There are more than 40,000 species worldwide, about 2,000 of which are found in North America and 2,700 in Europe. There are a large number of subfaamilies.
Although their body shapes and colouring vary, most are shiny black or metallic. They have ridged wing covers (elytra). The elytra are fused in some large flightless species.
Almost all carabids have a groove on their foreleg with a comb of hairs used to clean their antennae.
They defend themselves with noxious secretions. This is typical for the ancient beetle suborder Adephaga to which they belong. They have paired glands in the lower back of the abdomen. These are well developed, and produce noxious or even caustic secretions used to deter would-be predators. 
In bombardier beetles these secretions are mixed with volatile compounds and ejected by a small combustion with a loud popping sound and a cloud of hot and acrid gas. This can injure small mammals, such as shrews, and may kill invertebrate predators outright. To humans, getting "bombed" by a bombardier beetle is a decidedly unpleasant experience. This ability has evolved twice – in the flanged bombardier beetles (Paussinae) which are among the most ancient ground beetles, as well as in the typical bombardier beetles (Brachininae) which are part of a more "modern" lineage. 
The Anthiini can squirt their defensive secretions for considerable distances and are able to aim with a startling degree of accuracy; in Afrikaans they are known as "" ("eye-pissers"). Charles Darwin got on the receiving end of a bombardier beetle's defences on a collecting trip in 1828. He discussed this in a letter:
"A "Cychrus rostratus" once squirted into my eye & gave me extreme pain; & I must tell you what happened to me on the banks of the Cam in my early entomological days; under a piece of bark I found two carabi (I forget which) & caught one in each hand, when lo & behold I saw a sacred "Panagaeus cruxmajor"; I could not bear to give up either of my Carabi, & to lose "Panagæus" was out of the question, so that in despair I gently seized one of the carabi between my teeth, when to my unspeakable disgust & pain the little inconsiderate beast squirted his acid down my throat & I lost both Carabi & "Panagæus"!" 
Ground beetles often live under the bark of trees, under logs, or among rocks or sand by the edge of ponds and rivers. Most species are carnivorous and actively hunt for any invertebrate prey they can overpower. Some run fast to catch their prey; tiger beetles (Cicindelinae) are certainly fast runners in comparison to their length. Unlike most Carabidae, which are nocturnal, the tiger beetles are active daytime hunters and often brightly coloured. They have large eyes and hunt by sight. Ground beetles of the species "Promecognathus laevissimus" are specialised predators of the cyanide millipede "Harpaphe haydeniana". They can counter the hydrogen cyanide which makes these millipedes poisonous to most carnivores.

Punch-Out!! (Wii)

Punch-Out!! is a boxing video game written by Next Level Games for the Nintendo Wii. It is the fifth game in the "Punch-Out!!" series.
It was first sold at the Nintendo World Store in New York City on May 16, 2009. It was then in other shops from May 18, 2009 in North America, and from May 22, 2009 in Europe.
In January 2015 Nintendo Direct, said that "Punch-Out!!" and other Wii games would be released for download through the Wii U's Nintendo eShop.
"Punch-Out!!" stars a boxer named Little Mac working his way up the professional boxing circuits, facing a series of colorful boxers. The game requires good speed to keep up with the boxers who are controlled by the Wii. Some of the new opponents in this game are Disco Kid, Giga Mac and Donkey Kong. There are also ten boxers from old versions of "Punch-Out!!". 
The Wii Remote and Nunchuk can be used together, a Wii Balance Board can be used along with Wii Remote and Nunchuk to duck or dodge, or the Wii Remote can be used by itself.
The player must react quickly and spot the moves the opponent is about to make. They need to dodge or block their attacks, before returning with attacks to either the body or the head with the left and right fists. Hitting a weak point at the right time earns stars, with the player able to save up to three stars, losing them if they are hit. When the player has one or more stars, they can perform a Star Punch which deals extra damage. Each fighter has a gauge which must be run down in order to knock the opponent down. Also the player has a heart counter that goes down if they are hit, or if their attacks are blocked. If it reaches zero, the player cannot attack. The player wins a match by either knocking out their opponent (either by a ten count or because they are unable to recover), earning a "technical knock out" by knocking them down three times in a single round, or winning by decision after three rounds have passed. If the player is hit by a knockout punch, it is possible to recover.
The game was revealed in 2008 at the Nintendo Media Summit, where a fifteen second trailer was shown. It was later announced that it was being developed by Next Level Games which had worked with Nintendo on games such as "Super Mario Strikers". Nintendo wished to make a new game similar to the original "Punch-Out!!" for the NES, so they asked the studio to design the game to be exactly like it and the characters to look like the original games.

Reagan Era

The Reagan Era or Age of Reagan is an era in American history that lasted from 1981 to 1989. It is used by historians and political theorists to show that the conservative "Reagan Revolution" led by President Ronald Reagan in domestic and foreign policy had a long and lasting impact. 
Ronald Reagan was elected President in 1980. He defeated incumbent Jimmy Carter by winning 44 out of the 50 American states. When Ronald Reagan became president, he signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which some people say helped the economy. Afterwards more and more jobs began to appear. More people were getting jobs. Inflation decreased. During Reagan's presidency, he also helped expand the American military. This also created more jobs, but also raised the deficit. During his first term, the economy went from a 4.5% to 7.2%.
In 1984, Reagan won in a major landslide by winning 49 out of the 50 American states. During his second term, Reagan focused on ending the Cold War. He held many meetings between Margaret Thatcher, Pope John Paul II, and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. They first met at the Geneva Summit in 1985. Later they both discovered their passion of ending the war. Reagan met four times with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who ascended to power in 1985, and their summit conferences led to the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
Also during his second term, Reagan's Invasion of Grenada and bombing of Libya were popular in the US, though his backing of the Contras rebels was mired in the controversy over the Iran–Contra affair that revealed Reagan's poor management style.
They thought Reagan dominated this stretch of American history in the same way that President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal legacy dominated the forty years that followed. The Reagan Era included ideas and personalities beyond Reagan himself. Since leaving office in 1989, Reagan has become one of the most popular Presidents of the United States. 
Reagan is usually characterized as the leader of a conservative movement whose ideas, whether good or bad, overwhelmed the national policy making in areas such as taxes, welfare, defense, the federal judiciary and the Cold War. Liberals are annoyed by the Reagan Era, while conservatives extremely like it and thought it was the best thing to happen in American history.

Buitreraptor is a small dromaeosaur from the Cretaceous of Argentina. It was about four to five feet long (1.5 metres).
"Buitreraptor" has a slender, flat, extremely elongated snout. Its jaws have many small teeth which lack meat-tearing serrations or cutting edges. They are grooved, strongly recurved and flattened. This probably meant it ate quite small animals, like lizards and mammals. 
Since its close relatives had feathers, it is likely that "Buitreraptor" also was feathered.

Sri Lankan elephant

The Sri Lankan elephant ("Elephas maximus maximus") is one of the three subspecies of the Asian elephant ("Elephas maximus"). 
The other two subspecies are the Indian elephant ("Elephas maximus indicus") and the Sumatran elephant ("Elephas maximus sumatranus"). 
The Sri Lankan elephant is the largest of the three subspecies. They are about tall, and can weigh up to . They eat leaves, shrubs, grasses, and other plants. 
This subspecies is the National animal of Sri Lanka and is native to the island country. It once lived over the entire island. They now live in the dry zones in the north, east, and southeast. These zones are mainly dry deciduous woodland, scrubland, grassland, and marshes. There is a small group in the rainforest. 
Sri Lankan elephants are sometimes working animals. They carry timber, transport passengers, and participate in public events like the Procession of Buddha's Tooth. They were many of them in the past. They were aggressively hunted. 
In modern times, these elephants can be seen in Sri Lanka's national parks and elephant orphanages. They have been declared an endangered species, and are protected by law. Killing one carries the death penalty.
Asian elephants are usually smaller than African elephants. Females are usually smaller than males. Life span is about 60-70 years in the wild, and over 80 years in captivity. Elderly elephants may starve to death when their teeth wear out or fall out. 
The Asian elephant's highest body point is on its head. The tip of their trunk is used like a finger. Their back is curved upward or level. 
Their ears are smaller than those of the African elephant. Their feet have more "nails" than those of African elephants. They have five "nails" on each front foot, and four on each back foot. 
Very few of Sri Lankan male elephants develop tusks. A tusk is a very long tooth that protrudes from the elephant's mouth. An elephant with huge tusks is called a "tusker". Females have no tusks. 
Sri Lankan elephants are the largest subspecies of the Asian elephant. Their shoulder height is between 6 and 11 ft. They weigh between 4,000 and 12,000 lb.
Like humans, apes, and dolphins, they have a large and well developed brain. They are very smart. Elephants have the largest brain of all land animals. They have very good memories. They can remember places, people, and events from long in the past. 
Their skin color is darker than that of the two other Asian subspecies. They may have large patches of skin color loss (depigmentation) on ears, face, trunk, and tummy. 
The Sri Lankan elephant was once widely distributed across Sri Lanka. Over the past two hundred years however, human land use and development has forced the elephant from the wet and fertile regions of the southwest to the drier regions of the north, east, and southeast. These drier areas are mainly deciduous woodland, scrub, grassland, and marshes.
Like the two other subspecies of Asian elephants, Sri Lankan elephants live in groups of individuals that are related by blood. The group is led by a matriarch. She is usually the oldest and most experienced female in the group.
Sometimes a group will join another group to become a clan. The clan may then join another group or clan to become a herd. Groups are female-centered, and consist of grandmothers, mothers, daughters, sisters, and aunts. 
Immature male elephants are members of the group, but once they reach sexual maturity, the females drive them out of the group. These males may then join bachelor groups or live on their own.
A mature male elephant is a bull, and a mature female elephant is a cow. Their offspring are called calves. Calves suckle for 2 to 5 years, and develop close ties with their mothers. All cows in the group, clan, or herd will help in different ways to raise and protect the calves.
Male calves are more likely to leave their mothers to play. Play involves head sparring, mounting, charging, shoving, and chasing. Female calves play chasing and running games, throw sticks, and may attack imaginary foes. Both sexes play rough and tumble games with each other.
When males reach sexual maturity in their early teens, the matriarch and other female members of the group will chase him away. These males will not be able to mate with their relatives. The babies of such close unions will likely be inferior elephants.
Young males often form bachelor groups. Only a very few of Sri Lankan male elephants develop tusks. Female do not have tusks. Males become more solitary as they grow older. Adult males join females only for mating. Males do not help in raising the young.
Sri Lankan elephants eat leaves, grasses, shrubs, and vines. They sometimes enter farm gardens and eat crop plants. Baby and young elephants feed mostly on different grasses. 
Sri Lankan elephants are both browsers and grazers. They walk along and eat, but also stand still and eat what they can reach.
Adult elephants eat 300-400 lb. of food per day to support their bulk. These elephants will eat for up to 16 hours a day to meet their need for food. They drink from 25 to 50 gallons of water daily.
The elephants use less than 50% of the food they eat. They produce huge amounts of manure. They defecate about 16–18 times a day, and produce about 220 lbs. of dung.
In the wild, this manure carries and spreads the undigested seeds in the elephant's diet. Their manure is a source of food for insects and birds.
Asian male elephants reach sexual maturity during their early teens. At that time, they enter an annual phase called "musth". This is a period when they become sexually aggressive. They will fight other males to mate with a female.
Once a male and female have successfully mated, a baby elephant called a calf develops in the mother's womb. The calf is born after an 18 to 22 month period. At birth, the calf weighs about 220 lb. Twins are rare. 
Babies are weaned at 18 months to 3 years or longer. Female calves stay close to their mothers to strengthen their bonds; male calves venture away from their mothers to explore and play. 
Once a mother gives birth, she usually does not breed again until the first calf is weaned. This results in a birth interval of 4 to 5 years. Mothers remain with their herd, but mature males are driven away.
In the distant past, Sri Lankan elephants numbered in the hundreds of thousands. They lived in all zones of the island. They were aggressively hunted by Sri Lankans, other Asians, and Europeans. 
In the 19th century, a British officer was said to have killed 1,500 elephants. Other British officers held similar records. Between 1829 and 1855 alone, more than 6,000 elephants were captured and killed. 
In 2014, there was an estimated 4,000 elephants living on Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan elephant is protected under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance of Sri Lanka (FFPO), and killing it carries the death penalty. 
Sri Lankan elephants are important to the economic and cultural life of Sri Lanka. Some are working elephants. They are used to carry timber. These elephants are losing their jobs because tractors are replacing them. 
Elephants can be seen in protected areas and national parks. These elephants attract tourists. This trade improves the economy and the lives of Sri Lankans. 
The elephant has always been held in great cultural esteem in Sri Lanka. Rajah, a Sri Lankan elephant with tusks that nearly touched the ground, was declared a national treasure in 1985.
Sri Lankan elephants participate in ceremonies, processions, and other public events. The Esala Perahera (the festival of Buddha's tooth) is held annually in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is thought to date to the 3rd century BC. Elephants lead the procession, bearing the sacred tooth.
Sri Lankan elephants face the same threats to survival as other Asian elephant subspecies do: the clearing of forests to make way for farms and other human developments has destroyed their living areas. 
Conflicts between elephants and humans have been the result. These conflicts have led to the death of both elephants and humans, and the destruction of property. The situation is complicated by the elephant's taste for crops grown by humans such as sugar cane, bananas, and other fruits. 
In 1997, about 126 wild elephants were lost as a result of these conflicts. Conflict between government troops and a terrorist group called the Tamil Tigers has also put elephants at risk.

Holiday in Cambodia

"Holiday in Cambodia" is the second single off American hardcore punk band Dead Kennedys' debut studio album "Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables". The song was released in May 1980. 
The cover art for the song was taken during the Thammasat University massacre on 6 October 1976 in Thailand. It shows a member of a right-wing crowd beating the corpse of a student protester with a chair. The song is against both Eastern totalitarianism and Western complacency. The original version of the song features the satirically quoted word "niggers", later performances of the song by the Dead Kennedys, as well as other artists have replaced the word with "brothers". Biafra, however, has often replaced the word with "blacks".
Lead singer Jello Biafra was sued by the other members of Dead Kennedy because he would not allow the song to be used in a Levi's Dockers commercial. Biafra opposed Levi's because he believes they use unfair business practices and sweatshop labor. The other members of the band said that they had had their royalties defrauded. "The record industry has been skimming royalties owed artists since the beginning," according to Dead Kennedys guitarist East Bay Ray. "This case is no different from blues musicians being taken advantage of in the twenties and thirties. Many people doubted the claims we made against our former record label back in 1998 but with this announcement there is no denying we were the victims here."

Antimatter fuel

Antimatter, when it comes into contact with regular matter, releases a huge amount of energy. This energy is in the form of an explosion. This explosion can be harnessed for electrical means (Creating electricity) or as a thrust (Because antimatter has to be created, it would be extremely inefficient to use for electricity.) Since newtons laws state that if you push something, you get pushed. That is how rockets work. The antimatter can be exploded and forced behind the rocket, pushing the rocket forward. But antimatter reactions can produce harmful discharges of high energy gamma rays. High energy gamma rays break down molecules in cells and can also make the rocket engines radioactive. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is currently doing research to reduce this harmful side effect.

List of mammals of Great Britain

This is a list of mammals of Great Britain. 
The Great Britain mammal fauna is impoverished compared with that of continental Europe. This is because there was only a short time between the last ice age and the flooding of the land bridge between Britain and the rest of Europe. The list only has land species which crossed before the creation of the English Channel, and those later brought in by humans.
Native (indigenous) species have three possible definitions:
This list includes mammals from the small islands around Great Britain and the Channel Islands. There are no endemic mammal species in Great Britain, although four distinct subspecies of rodents have arisen on small islands.
Rodents make up the largest order of mammals, with over 40 percent of mammalian species. They have two incisors in the upper and lower jaw which grow continuously and must be kept short by gnawing. Most rodents are small though the coypu (once introduced to Great Britain, but subsequently eradicated) can weigh up to 9 kg (15.5 lb).
Family: Castoridae (beavers)
Family: Cricetidae (voles)
Family: Muridae (rats, mice and relatives)
Family: Gliridae (dormice)
Family: Sciuridae (squirrels)
The lagomorphs comprise two families, Leporidae (hares and rabbits), and Ochotonidae (pikas). Though they can resemble rodents, and were classified as a superfamily in that order until the early 20th century, they have since been considered a separate order. They differ from rodents in a number of physical characteristics, such as having four incisors in the upper jaw rather than two.
Family: Leporidae (hares and rabbits)
Superorder: Laurasiatheria
Order: Erinaceomorpha
The order Erinaceomorpha contains a single family, Erinaceidae, which comprise the hedgehogs and gymnures. The hedgehogs are easily recognised by their spines while gymnures look more like large rats.
Superorder: Laurasiatheria
Order: Soricomorpha
The "shrew-forms" are insectivorous mammals. The shrews and soledons closely resemble mice while the moles are stout-bodied burrowers. 
Superorder: Laurasiatheria
Order: Chiroptera
The bats' most distinguishing feature is that their forelimbs are developed as wings, making them the only mammals in the world naturally capable of flight. Bat species account for about 20% of all mammals.
Superorder: Laurasiatheria
Order: Artiodactyla
The even-toed ungulates are ungulates whose weight is borne about equally by the third and fourth toes, rather than mostly or entirely by the third as in perissodactyls. There are about 220 artiodactyl species, including many that are of great economic importance to humans.
Superorder: Laurasiatheria
Order: Perissodactyla
The odd-toed ungulates are browsing and grazing mammals. They are usually large to very large, and have relatively simple stomachs and a large middle toe.
Superorder: Laurasiatheria
Order: Carnivora
There are over 260 species of carnivorans, the majority of which feed primarily on meat. They have a characteristic skull shape and dentition. 
The order Cetacea includes whales, dolphins and porpoises. They are the mammals most fully adapted to aquatic life with a spindle-shaped nearly hairless body, protected by a thick layer of blubber, and forelimbs and tail modified to provide propulsion underwater.
Though most marsupials make up a great part of the fauna in the Australian region, the red-necked wallaby has been introduced and a feral population is currently breeding on the island of Inchconnachan, and at Loch Lomond in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. A smaller group is present on the Isle of Man, and the species is locally extinct in the Peak District, in Cumbria, and at Ashdown Forest in East Sussex.
Family: Macropodidae (kangaroos, wallabies, and kin)
Rodents make up the largest order of mammals, with over 40 percent of mammalian species. They have two incisors in the upper and lower jaw which grow continuously and must be kept short by gnawing. Most rodents are small though the coypu (once introduced to Great Britain, but subsequently eradicated) can weigh up to 9 kg (15.5 lb).
