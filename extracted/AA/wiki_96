Bracket fungus

Bracket fungi, or shelf fungi, are among the many groups of fungi in the phylum Basidiomycota. 
They produce shelf- or bracket-shaped fruiting bodies called conks. These lie in a close group of horizontal rows. Brackets can range from only a single row of a few caps, to dozens of rows of caps that can weigh several hundred pounds. They are mainly found on trees (living and dead) and woody debris. Some form annual fruiting bodies while others are perennial and grow larger year after year. Bracket fungi are usually tough and sturdy. Their spores, called basidiospores, are in pores on the undersurface.

Jelly fungi are a paraphyletic group of several fungal orders from different classes of the subphylum Agaricomycotina. The name comes from their form, or growth habit. Their fruiting body is foliose or irregularly branched. It looks like jelly. Actually, many are somewhat rubbery and gelatinous. When dried, jelly fungi become hard and shriveled; when exposed to water, they return to their original form.
Some jelly fungi can be eaten raw; poisonous jelly fungi are rare. However, many species have an unpalatable texture or taste. However, some species, "Tremella fuciformis" for example, are not only edible but prized for use in soup and vegetable dishes.

The stinkhorns are a family of fungi, the Phallaceae. Belonging to the fungal order Phallales, the Phallaceae have a worldwide distribution, but are especially common in tropical regions. Their mushrooms are foul-smelling, sticky spore masses, or gleba, on the end of a stalk. 
Their mushroom distinguishes the Phallaceae from other families in the Phalalles. The spore mass smells of carrion or dung, and attracts flies and other insects to help disperse the spores. Although a great diversity of body structure shape exists between the various genera, all species in the Phallaceae begin their development as oval or round structures known as "eggs". According to a 2008 estimate, the family contains 21 genera and 77 species.

Second Battle of Bull Run

The Second Battle of Bull Run (also called the Battle of Second Manassas) was a battle during the American Civil War. It was fought from August 28 to August 30, 1862. It ended in a Confederate victory.
Union president Abraham Lincoln formed the Army of Virginia near Washington, D.C. in July 1862. He put Major General John Pope in command of the army. Lincoln wanted Pope to attack the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia.
Confederate General Robert E. Lee commanded the Army of Northern Virginia. He was trying to protect Richmond from another Union army on the Peninsula. The Union Army of the Potomac had just tried to capture Richmond a few weeks before but failed. Lee would be outnumbered if the two Union armies united. He moved his army north to fight Pope.
Lee planned to send Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson's corps to the rear of Pope's army. He wanted to surround Pope. Jackson camped near the Bull Run on August 28, where the First Battle of Bull Run was fought in 1861. Jackson attacked part of Pope's army on August 28 but was defeated.
Pope then tried to attack Jackson on August 29 and destroy his corps. All of the Union attacks failed. Lee arrived during the evening with James Longstreet's corps.
Pope tried to attack Jackson again on August 30 but again was defeated. Lee then attacked Pope and routed the Union army.
There were 13,826 Union casualties in the battle. Pope retreated back to Washington. His army was combined with the Army of the Potomac. Pope was sent to Minnesota after the battle.
There were 8,353 Confederate casualties in the battle. Lee decided to invade Maryland after the battle.

Cytotoxic T cell

A cytotoxic T cell is a type of white blood cell. It is a T lymphocyte which kills cancer cells, cells infected with viruses, or cells that are damaged in other ways.
Most cytotoxic T cells have T-cell receptors (TCRs) which recognize a specific antigen from a cancer cell or virus. 
Antigens inside a cell are brought to the surface of the cell by major histocompatibility complex molecules, where they can be recognized by the T cell. If the TCR is specific for that antigen, it binds to the complex of MHC molecule and antigen, and the T cell destroys the cell.

War (U2 album)

War is the third studio album by Irish rock band U2, released in 1983.
The band's first album, "Boy" is about childhood and the second album, "October" is about spirituality. This album is about war and politics. This is because of songs like "Sunday Bloody Sunday". The album was named "War" because of what was happening in the world while they were recording. Bono said that "everywhere you looked, from the Falklands to the Middle East and South Africa, there was war."
"War" sold well for the band right away. Michael Jackson's album, "Thriller" fell from the top of the charts. "War" became U2's first album in the United Kingdom to reach #1. It was not well liked by British critics at first, but over the years has gained approval.
U2 began recording "War" in May 1982. Bono and his bride Alison, had just been married. The band took a break while Bono and Alison went on a honeymoon in Jamaica. But Bono worked on the lyrics for the upcoming album while on vacation.
All of the songs and the lyrics were written by U2.

Sweet roll

A sweet roll (or sweet bun) refers to any kind of bread roll or bun that is made to taste sweet. They are eaten as a breakfast or dessert food. They may contain spices, nuts, fruits, and are often glazed or topped with icing. Compared to regular bread dough, sweet roll dough generally has more sugar, fat, eggs and yeast. They are often round, and are small enough to be eaten by one person. They are different to pastries, which are made from a paste-like batter, and from cakes, which are usually not leavened like bread is. They are also not the same as doughnuts, which are deep fried.

Viscount

A Viscount (, ) is a member of the European nobility. A viscount usually ranks above a baron and below a count. The female equivalent is a Viscountess.
Beginning in the early ninth century the Carolingian kings appointed counts to run local county governments. The counts used viscounts or deputy counts to assist them.
The viscounts served as deputies of the county. They had military, financial, administrative and judicial authority. They carried out court orders and held courts of their own. Viscounts also collected money for the king. Starting with the reign of Philip the Fair they were paid regular salaries. In the early tenth century, viscounts in the south of France gave themselves the rights of counts for their own profit. In Narbonne and Nimes the office became just like that of a count. Elsewhere in France viscounts began replacing counts where they could. A Viscounty (or Viscountship) was the office, area or jurisdiction of a viscount. By the eleventh century viscounts had become hereditary offices in most of Western Europe. In Normandy, before 1066, Duke William I began to view the position of a viscount as being . After 1066, and as King of England, William made several of his viscounts in Normandy, earls in England (an English earl was about the same as a count in Europe). But there were no viscounts in the English peerage and he did not create any.
In eleventh century Italy, the office and the lands of a viscount began to be thought of as the hereditary property of the family. The title, as with that of count or marquis was used by all members of a family.
The first introduction of the title of viscount in England was in the fifteenth century. The first to be recognized, John Beaumont was already a viscount in Maine. This was to give him a rank above the barons in the English peerage. Afterward it became a regular rank in the peerage. In England, and later in the United Kingdom, a viscount ranks above a baron but below an earl. The wife of a viscount is called a countess.

Montacute, South Australia

Montacute is a small town and suburb in Adelaide Hills, South Australia. The town is on Fifth Creek. It is mostly a rural area. Rostrevor is to the west of the suburb, while Lenswood is to the east, Castambul is to the north, and Norton Summit and Cherryville are to its west. The small town of Montacute Heights is on top of the ridge between Fifth and Sixth Creeks.
Copper was discovered in the area in 1843, and a mine was built soon after. One of the people who gave money for the mine was Sir John Baker. He named the area after Montacute in Somerset, which was close to the place where he was born. Gold was discovered in 1846. The "Victoria Mine" became the first gold deposit to be commercially mined in Australia.
The main industries are now orchards and market gardens. The 200-hectare Montacute Conservation Park was founded in 1971.
Corkscrew Road is a popular route for cyclists and people on day-trips. It is a small road linking Montacute Heights with Gorge Road via a precipitous route with many twists and turns.

Lionel Rose

Lionel Edmund Rose MBE (21 June 1948 – 8 May 2011) was an Australian boxer. He was the first indigenous Australian to win a world title. Rose was ranked as a bantamweight boxer. This is a class for boxers who weigh between .
Rose was born and raised in Victoria. He was born at Jacksons Track, and lived in the town of Warragul. Rose had a difficult childhood. He learned to box from his father, Roy. Roy was a skilled fighter who competed in local house shows. At the age of 10, Rose was given a pair of gloves by his teacher, Ian Hawkins. When he was about 15, he began to be taught by Frank Oakes, a trainer in Warragul. Rose later married Frank's daughter, Jenny Oakes.
In 1970, at the age of 15, Rose won the Australian amateur flyweight title.
Rose competed in his first professional boxing match on 9 September 1964. He won against Mario Magriss over eight rounds. This fight was in Warragul, but most of Rose's fights were held in Melbourne. Along the way he was helped by Jack and Shirley Rennie. He stayed in their home in Melbourne, training each day in their backyard.
Rose won his first five matches. After this, he was rematched with Singtong Por Tor, whom he had previously beaten in a 12-round decision. They fought this rematch on 23 July 1965. Por Tor won in six rounds by earning more points than Rose. This was Rose's first defeat. On 14 October 1965, he had his first fight outside Australia. He fought Laurie Ny in Christchurch, New Zealand. Rose beat Ny in 10 rounds.
Of his next nine fights, Rose won eight. He scored one knockout. The one match he lost in those nine fights was to Ray Perez. On 28 October 1966, he fought for the Australian bantamweight title against Noel Kunde in Melbourne. He won the title by defeating Kunde in a 15-round decision. By winning in this match, Rose became the Australian bantamweight champion.
Rose won one more belt in 1966 and eight in 1967. He defended his Australian championship against Rocky Gattellari, winning by knockout in the 13th round of the match. After this, Rose challenged Fighting Harada for the world bantamweight championship on 26 February 1968 in Tokyo. He beat Harada in a 15-round decision. This win made him the first Aboriginal Australian to be a world-champion boxer. It made Rose a national hero in Australia, particularly among Aboriginal Australians. He was awarded Australian of the Year for 1968.
On 2 July of that year, Rose returned to Tokyo to defend his title against Takao Sakurai. He beat Sakurai with a 15-round decision. On 6 December, he fought against Chucho Castillo in Inglewood, California. Rose beat Castillo by decision, but the verdicts in favour of him made many in the crowd angry, as they supported Castillo. A riot began, the referee and 14 fans were injured.
On 8 March 1969, Rose fought against Alan Rudkin. Rose won in a 15-round decision, and kept the championship. Five months later, he returned to Inglewood, where he faced Rubén Olivares on 22 August. Olivares knocked out Rose in the fifth round, and so Rose lost the world bantamweight title.
Rose continued boxing after his defeat against Olivares. However, after he lost several fights against boxers who were not very well known, many believed his career as a prime fighter was over. On 10 October 1970, he beat future world lightweight champion Itshimatsu Suzuki in a 10-round decision. Once again, he became a world title challenger, but in the lightweight division.
Rose lost to Jeff White for the Australian lightweight championship. He then fought against world junior lightweight champion Yoshiaki Numata, on 30 May 1971 in Hiroshima. Numata beat Rose by a 15-round decision. Rose announced his retirement soon after.
During his break from boxing in the 1970s, Rose begun a modest career as a singer. He had a few songs that were successful in Australia, such as "I Thank You" and "Please Remember Me" in 1970. The song "I Thank You" was one of the most successful singles in Australia in 1970. It was played instead of the Australian National Anthem during radio broadcasts of the Rugby League State of Origin.
Rose came back to boxing in 1975. However, after losing four of his six matches, including one against Rafael Limón, he decided to retire forever. As a professional boxer, Rose had a record of 42 wins and 11 losses, with 12 wins by knockout.
After boxing, Rose became a successful businessman. A television miniseries called "Rose Against the Odds" (1991) was made about Rose's life story. It starred Paul Williams and Telly Savalas. It was released as a full-length movie in 1995. Melbourne filmmaker Eddie Martin premiered his feature-length documentary "Lionel" at the Melbourne International Film Festival in 2008.
Rose was one of the original boxers to be inducted into the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame in 2003.
In 2007, Rose suffered a stroke. It left him unable to speak and move very well. He died on 8 May 2011, after an illness which lasted for several months.

Fulk II of Anjou

Fulk II of Anjou (–960), called the good (), was a French nobleman and the Count of Anjou from 942 to his death in 960.
Fulk II was born about 905. He was the son of Fulk the Red and his wife Roscilla de Loches. She was a daughter of Warnerius, Seigneur de Villentrois. He succeeded his father in 942 as the second count of Anjou (also called the count of Angers) and remained in power until 960.
The Angevins, Fulk II included, had become very good at making marriage alliances that helped their goals. His father, Fulk the Red, had arranged his marriage to a Carolingian, Gerberga, the daughter of Ratburnus I Viscount of Vienne. Among other things this marriage made it possible for their daughter Adelaide-Blanche to marry a future king of France. It made them important enough for their son Guy to become Bishop of le Puy.
After Gerberga died Fulk made another political marriage. He married Adelaide, the widow of Alan II, Duke of Brittany. Alan II had also been Count of Nantes and the marriage probably gave Fulk control of Nantes. Adelaide was also the sister of Theobald I, Count of Blois. This allowed Fulk II to form an alliance with the House of Blois. Fulk died in 960. He was succeeded by his son Geoffrey Greymantle.
By his wife, Gerberge, Fulk II had several children:
By his second wife Adelaide, he had no children.

Morpho

A Morpho is a butterfly in one of over 29 species and 147 subspecies in the genus "Morpho". 
Morphos are Neotropical butterflies found mostly in South America, Mexico and Central America. Morphos range in wingspan from the 7.5 cm (3 inch) "M. rhodopteron" to the imposing 20 cm (8 inch) Sunset Morpho, "M. hecuba". 
Many Morpho butterflies are coloured in metallic, shimmering shades of blue and green. These colours are not caused by pigment. They are an example of iridescence: light reflects through the microscopic scales covering the Morpho's wings. 
The blue Morpho species have sexual dimorphism. In some species only the males are iridescent blue, the females are camouflaged brown and yellow. In other species the females are partially iridescent but less blue than the males.
Their habitat is the primary forests of the Amazon and Atlantic. They can breed in other forested habitats, for instance the dry deciduous woodlands of Nicaragua and in secondary forests.
Morphos are strong fliers, found at altitudes between sea level and about 1400 m. Morphos are diurnal: males spend the mornings patrolling along forest streams and rivers. They are territorial and will chase any rivals. Morphos typically live alone out of the mating season.
The adults are usually palatable, but hard to catch because they are such strong fliers. Birds find it very hard to catch them. 
The conspicuous blue coloration shared by most "Morpho" species may be a case of Müllerian mimicry, or may be 'pursuit aposematism'. This means the bird learns that the colour says, in effect, "don't waste your energy, you can't catch me".
The entire life cycle of the Morpho butterfly, from egg to death, is approximately 115 days.
Although the adults are palatable, the larvae are not. Their hairs are irritating, and when disturbed they secrete a noxious fluid which smells like rancid butter. The strong odour is a defence against predators. 
The caterpillar will molt five times before entering the pupal stage. The bulbous chrysalis is pale-green or jade-green and emits a repulsive, ultrasonic sound when touched. It is suspended from a stem or leaf of the foodplant.

Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)

The Wells Fargo Center is a multi-use indoor arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was called Spectrum II before it was built. It has previously been called the CoreStates Center, First Union Center and Wachovia Center.
The Wells Fargo Center is the home arena of the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League, the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association, the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League, and the Philadelphia Soul of the Arena Football League. The Center was finished in 1996 to replace the Spectrum as the home arena of the Flyers, 76ers, and Wings. It was built on the former site of John F. Kennedy Stadium (originally Philadelphia Municipal Stadium). The cost of it was $210 million, and it was mostly privately financed (though the city and state helped to pay for the local infrastructure). It is owned by Comcast Spectacor, which also owns the Flyers. Global Spectrum operates the arena. Comcast Spectacor also owns Global Spectrum. 
The Wells Fargo Center is at the southwest corner of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. Some of the buildings there are Lincoln Financial Field, Citizens Bank Park, and Xfinity Live!.
The Center officially seats 20,318 for NBA and NCAA basketball games and 19,537 for NHL hockey and indoor ("box") NLL lacrosse. With more standing-room areas available in luxury and club-box suites, the total paid capacity is actually more than that. The Center has 126 luxury suites, 1,880 club-box seats, and a many restaurants and clubs (both public and private) available for use by patrons. The offices, studios, and production facilities of Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia are all located in the facility.
On June 9, 2010, the Center set the record for the highest attendance for an indoor hockey game in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania (20,327) when the Flyers lost Game 6 of the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals to the Chicago Blackhawks. The Center also set a record for the highest attendances for a college basketball game in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania on February 13, 2006, when Villanova University played and defeated the #1 ranked University of Connecticut before a crowd of 20,859.
On August 1, 2006, Comcast Spectacor announced it would add a new center-hung scoreboard to replace the original one made by Daktronics. The new scoreboard, manufactured by ANC Sports is like other scoreboards in new NBA & NHL arenas. Another linear LED display lining the entire arena was also added between the suite and mezzanine levels. Other renovations for the Center's ten-year anniversary included upgrading the suites with more flat screen TV's, as well as changing ticket providers from Ticketmaster to New Era Tickets, which is owned by Comcast Spectacor.
The PA announcer at the Center for Flyers games is Lou Nolan, who moved with the team from the Spectrum, where he has worked since 1972. Matt Cord is the PA announcer for 76ers games. Jim Bachman is the PA announcer for Villanova basketball games. Kevin Casey handles PA duties for the Philadelphia Wings.

Protocol 41 is a communication protocol which embeds internet protocol version 6 (IPv6) packets inside Internet protocol version 4 (IPv4) packets. It is usually used to allow a computer or router with only an IPv4 address to obtain an IPv6 address (or possibly more than one address, to serve multiple computers). Most IPv6 tunnel providers support Protocol 41, including Hurricane Electric and SixXS. 6to4, 6rd, and 6in4 are all different methods of using Protocol 41. Protocol 41 does not use TCP or UDP (although the IPv6 packets inside can carry TCP and UDP traffic). Is not to be confused with TCP or UDP port number 41.

On Human Nature is a 1979 Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson. 
The book tries to explain how aspects of humans and society can be explained from the point of view of evolution. He explains how evolution has left its traces on the characteristics which are the specialty of the human species. Examples are generosity, self-sacrifice, worship and the use of sex for pleasure. 
The book was an attempt to complete the Darwinian revolution by bringing biological thought into social sciences and humanities.

Sociobiology: the new synthesis

Sociobiology: the new synthesis is a book by E.O. Wilson that helped start the sociobiology debate, one of the great scientific controversies of the 20th century. Wilson popularized the term "sociobiology" as an attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind behaviours such as altruism, aggression, and nurture. The fundamental principles guiding sociobiology are:
The book was first published in 1975, then reprinted in 1976. A twenty-fifth anniversary edition was published in 2000 by Harvard University Press.
The application of sociobiology to humans was immediately controversial. Some people, such as Stephen Jay Gould, and Richard Lewontin said that sociobiology was biologicially determinist. They argued that it would be used, as similar ideas had been in the past, to justify the status quo, entrench ruling elites, and legitimize authoritarian political programmes. They referred to social darwinism and eugenics of the early 20th century, and to other more recent ideas, such as the race and IQ controversy of the early 1970s as cautionary tales in the use of evolutionary principles as applied to human society. 
Wilson and his admirers countered these criticisms by saying that Wilson had no political agenda, and if he had one it was certainly not authoritarian (Wilson is an outspoken environmentalist). They argued that sociobiology does not necessarily lead to any particular political ideology as many critics implied. 
Many other sociobiologists have used sociobiology to argue quite separate points. Noam Chomsky surprised many by coming to the defense of sociobiology on the grounds that political radicals need to postulate a relatively fixed idea of human nature in order to be able to struggle for a better society. They needed to know what human needs were in order to build a better society. 
An extensive account of the controversy around the book was published 25 years later. It largely supporting Wilson's views. For ethologists, Wilson's ideas are mainstream, and for them his book is not controversial.

Geoffrey I, Count of Anjou

Geoffrey I of Anjou (930–987), called Greymantle (), was a French nobleman who was the Count of Anjou from 960 to 987. He greatly increased the power and influence of Anjou.
Geoffrey was the oldest son of Fulk II of Anjou and his first wife Gerberga.<ref name="ESIII/4-116">Detlev Schwennicke, "Europäische Stammtafeln|Europäische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europäischen Staaten", Neue Folge, Band III Teilband 1 (J. A. Stargardt, Marburg, Germany, 1984), Tafel 116</ref> He succeeded his father as Count of Anjou about 960. Geoffrey married Adele of Meaux (934–982). Adele was the daughter of Robert of Vermandois and Adelais de Vergy. On her mother's side she was a granddaughter of king Robert I of France. On her father's side she was a direct descendant of Charlemagne. Her cousin was Hugh Capet, King of the Franks. Through this marriage the Angevins joined the highest ranks of western French nobility. 
Geoffrey started by making his power base the of Angers. Geoffrey carefully placed his loyal followers on lands surrounding the city. This was to protect his own territories. The lands of the abbeys of Saint-Aubin and Saint-Serge in Angers provided revenues for his most faithful men. Geoffrey told both his sons, Fulk and Maurice: "No house is weak that has many friends. Therefore I you to hold dear those who have been friends." Geoffrey used several ways of expanding his power and control. Creating family connections was one way. For example his father had controlled Nantes by marrying the countess. Geoffrey brought Nantes under control by making Count Guerech accept him as overlord. For some time the counts of Maine and the bishops of Le Mans had been fighting among themselves. Geoffrey saw a way to take advantage of the situation. About 971 Geoffrey secured the diocese of Le Mans for his ally and friend Bishop Seinfroy. Then, in 973, Geoffrey arranged the marriage of his daughter Ermengarde-Gerberga to Conan I of Rennes, the count of Maine. But rather than act like an ally Conan began to oppose Geoffrey. In 982 the two met at the first battle of Conquereuil where Geoffrey defeated Conan. 
Geoffrey had influence in Aquitaine through his sister Adelaide-Blanche's first marriage to the powerful baron Stephen, Count of Gevaudan and Forez. After his death the lands were ruled by his widow Adelaide-Blanche. Their sons, Geoffrey's nephews, Pons and Bertrand succeeded as counts there. Geoffrey's niece, Adalmode, married Adelbert, Count of Marche and Périgord. In 975 Geoffrey had his brother Guy appointed as the Count and Bishop of Le Puy. In 982 Geoffrey married his now widowed sister Adelaide-Blanche to the fifteen-year-old Louis V of France. The two were crowned King and Queen of Aquitaine. But the two could not get along and the marriage failed. So did Geoffrey's plans to control Aquitaine through his young son-in-law. 
After the death of his first wife Adele, Geoffrey married secondly Adelaise de Châlon. By this marriage he exerted control over the county of Châlons. Through the marriage of his son, Fulk III, to Elisabeth the heiress of Vendôme Geoffrey brought that county under his influence. Geoffrey made his son Fulk Nerra his co-ruler just before he died while attacking the fortress of Marcon on 21 July 987.
He married Adele of Meaux (934–982), daughter of Robert of Vermandois and Adelais de Vergy. Their children were:

Land reclamation

Land reclamation is the idea of getting new land. It is usually done in coastal areas. Sometimes it is also done in areas like rivers and lakes. Usually, there is a natural process which fills such areas with sand, dirt and other materials. Land reclamation uses the same process, which is sped up. In many cases, this is done using dikes. An example where land reclamation is done is the IJsselmeer in the Netherlands. 
Pioneer plants, such as Salicornia or Ammophila grow there. When the level of the land is as high as that of the high tide, new ditches are dug, and the process can repeat. 
Sometimes, it is too time-consuming to wait for the land to rise. In that case, it is possible to pump out the water in the enclosed area. This was done in the Netherlands, where many areas are below sea level. The problem with this approach is that it needs to be repeated, for example in the case of heavy rainfall.
The creation of large, artificial islands, such as Palm Islands in Dubai or Maasvlakte, which is part of the port of Rotterdam is not known as Land reclamation.

Crossing the Rubicon

Crossing the Rubicon is a metaphor similar to "Burning one's bridges" and "the point of no return". It means passing a decisive point, where one cannot turn back. It comes from a genuine historical incident. The Rubicon is a shallow river in north-east Italy. According to Roman tradition and law Roman legions could not be brought south of the river without permission of the Roman Senate.
In 50 BC, the Senate, led by Pompey, ordered Julius Caesar to disband his army and return to Rome because his term as governor of Gaul had finished. Caesar thought he would be prosecuted if he entered Rome without the immunity enjoyed by a magistrate. Pompey accused Caesar of insubordination and treason.
Caesar and his army approached Rome and "crossed the Rubicon" in 49 BC. It was the point beyond which no army was supposed to go. The river marked the boundary between Cisalpine Gaul to the north, and Italy proper to the south. Pompey, the lawful Consul, and his friends, fled from Rome as Caesar's army approached. So began a civil war in which Caesar eventually triumphed.
What Caesar reportedly said at the crossing of the Rubicon is "Alea iacta est" ("The die is cast"). This is yet another metaphor. It comes from gambling with dice: once the die or dice have been thrown, no bets can be withdrawn or added, even before the dice have come to rest.

Pico Ruivo ("red peak" in Portuguese) is, with its , the highest point of the island of Madeira and the third summit of Portugal (after Mount Pico in Pico Island, Azores, and Torre in continental Portugal).
Pico Ruivo is in the Central Mountainous Massif, in the municipality of Santana, where there are also other high mountains like the "Pico das Torres", with and the "Pico do Arieiro", with .
Although of moderate altitude, the top has a very rocky landscape. The only vegetation that can develop there is of plants that grow on or among rocks.
There are two main types of vegetation: one with heathers, widespread on the island, and another with few herbaceous plants. A special feature for this altitude is the presence of small shrubs and heather trees.
Some birds found on Pico Ruivo are the common blackbird, chaffinch and the Madeira firecrest. The red-legged partridge and the common linnet also nest on Pico Ruivo.
Until a few years ago, its slopes were used for raising goats, sheep and cows. However, to conserve the biodiversity in the region (such as the protection of the bird "freira-da-madeira" and plant communities in altitude), this practice was prohibited and the entire area around the peak is recovering.
The summit of Pico Ruivo can be reached only on foot:

Russell's Paradox is the theory that states: If you have a list of lists that do not list themselves, then that list must list itself, because it doesn't contain itself. However, if it lists itself, it then contains itself, meaning it cannot list itself. This makes logical usages of lists of lists that don't contain themselves somewhat difficult. It was developed by Bertrand Russell.

Fulk III of Anjou

Fulk III "Nerra" (970–1040), was a French nobleman who was the Count of Anjou from 987 to his death. He built up Angevin power by building a network of castles. 
Fulk was the son of Geoffrey I, Count of Anjou and Adele of Meaux. He was born about 970. Fulk was born into a of counts going back nearly a hundred years. His father, grandfather, great-grandfather and second great-grandfather had all been counts of Anjou before him. His father, Geoffrey I had been preparing Fulk to be count as he raised him. He was about age seventeen when his father died and Fulk became the next count. Two years earlier, in 985, his father arranged for him to be married to Elizabeth de Vendome, daughter of Bouchard, Count of Vendome. His nickname "Nerra" meant 'the Black'. It was probably given to him after his death.
His first years as count were a constant fight for survival. His western borders and his holdings in Touraine were not secure. His concerns were mainly holding and defending Angevin interests. Fulk also faced opposition from the church. Bishop Renaud of Angers and Guntarius of St. Aubin both thought they could take advantage of an inexperienced young count. They wanted to take back lands they lost to Fulk's father, Geoffrey. But Fulk had a powerful ally in his uncle, Bishop Guy of Le Puy. Guy stepped in and sent the abbot on a pilgrimage and used force against Bishop Renaud.
Fulk fought against Conan I of Rennes at the Battle of Conquereuil on 27 June 992. Even though Conan had lost a battle to Fulk's father years before, he was still a powerful force in the region. Defeating and killing Conan gave Fulk Nerra a reputation as a very capable commander. Fulk then extended his power over Maine and Touraine. 
Fulk Nerra had a longstanding rivalry with Odo II, Count of Blois. Hugh Capet, king of France had supported the Angevins against Blois. But king Robert II of France had been married to Bertha, (Odo II's mother) and supported Blois against Anjou. The king opposed Fulk's designs on Touraine and this forced him to pull back to Anjou. When Fulk went to the Holy Land Odo II tried to take advantage. He built three new castles to counter those built by Fulk. When Robert II married again, this time to Constance of Arles, she was Fulk's cousin. Relations between the king and Fulk improved. When Count Hugh of Beauvais, a favorite of King Robert, began speaking against his new wife Constance, Fulk had him killed. This turned the king and the church against Fulk. To ask forgiveness, Fulk took a trip to the Holy Land (he made four total). When he returned he built a new monastery. The king decided to stay with Constance. He and Fulk reconcilled in Rome in 1016. That same year war broke out between Fulk and Odo II of Blois. Fulk allied with Herbert I, Count of Maine, called Wakedog, and they attacked Tours. Odo II came in response and the two met on 6 July 1016. Although he was knocked off his horse, Herbert Wakedog rescued him. Fulk defeated Odo II at the Battle of Pontlevoy. 
Odo II fell out of favor with king Robert. Robert asked Fulk to help him against Odo II, which he did. In 1026 when Odo II beseiged Montboyau, Fulk Nerra attacked Saumur. Fulk kept Samur while Odo II lost Montboyau. In the later part of his reign Fulk made several gains in the south including much of Poitou and built a castle there to protect his interests.
In defending his territory Fulk had a large number of castles and other built. Fulk used these castles both offensively and defensively. Some of his fortresses cut in half the territory of a neighboring lord. Others were used as forward bases for attacking Touraine.
Fulk could be ruthless at times. His treatment of his first wife is an example. When he thought she had committed adultery, he ordered his countess to be executed by burning. They had been married nearly fifteen years when she died. Fulk continued to control Vendome through their daughter, Adele, and her family. In 1028 Fulk and his second wife, Hildegarde, founded the abbey of Le Ronceray. Originally a church dedicated to St. Mary, Hildegard was very active in its rebuilding into an abbey. They gave the abbey many gifts including the forest of Lattay. Fulk died 1 April 1040 while returning from his last pilgrimage.
Fulk's first wife was Elizabeth de Vendome. Together they had a daughter: 
His second wife was Hildegard of Lorraine. Together they had two children:

Sophie Germain prime

A Sophie Germain prime is a type of prime number. If a prime number is still prime after being multiplied by 2 and adding 1 to the answer, then the original prime is a Sophie Germain prime. A mathematical definition is: a prime number, denoted by "p", is a Sophie Germain prime if "2p+1" is also a prime number. "2p+1" is called a safe prime if it is a prime number.
Sophie Germain primes are named after the French mathematician Sophie Germain.
Many mathematicians believe that there are an infinite amount of Sophie Germain primes, but this has not been proven.
11 is a Sophie Germain prime because 23 ((2 × 11) + 1 = 23) is also a prime number.
13 is a prime number but not a Sophie Germain prime because 27 ((2 × 13) + 1 = 27) is not a prime number.

Touraine

Touraine () is one of the traditional provinces of France. Its capital was Tours. In 1790 France changed from being divided into provinces to being divided into departments. Touraine was divided between the departments of Indre-et-Loire, :Loir-et-Cher and Indre.
Touraine has a network of rivers. The Loire and its tributaries the Cher, the Indre and the Vienne all make up a part of the Paris river basin. It is well known for its wine. The TGV connects Tours with Paris. The trip takes less than an hour. This has made Touraine a place of residence for people who work in the capital but seek a different quality of life.
Touraine takes its name from a Celtic tribe called the Turones, who inhabited the Tours region about two thousand years ago. 
In 1044, the control of Touraine was given to the counts of Anjou. This same dynasty who (as the House of Plantagenet) became kings of England in 1154. The castle of Chinon was their great stronghold. In 1205, Philip II Augustus of France regained Touraine. At this time, Touraine was made into a Duchy. In 1429, Saint Joan of Arc had a historic meeting with the future King of France Charles VII at Chinon. Throughout the late 15th and 16th centuries, Touraine was a favorite residence of French kings. The castles were converted to Renaissance ; for this reason the region was titled "The Garden of France". These same châteaux became popular tourist attractions in modern times.

Ali Hewson

Alison "Ali" Hewson (née Stewart; 23 March 1961) is an Irish activist and businesswoman. She is the wife of singer and musician Paul Hewson, known as Bono, from the rock group U2.
Raised in Raheny, she met her future husband at a young age at Mount Temple Comprehensive School and married him in 1982. She has a degree in politics and sociology from University College Dublin in 1989. The couple have four children together and live at residences in Ireland, France, and the United States. She has inspired several U2 songs, most famously "Sweetest Thing".
Alison Stewart was born on 23 March 1961,the daughter of Terry and Joy Stewart and the granddaughter of Hector Grey, a well known Dublin trader and shop owner. Alison studied at Mount Temple Comprehensive School where, at the age of twelve, she met Paul Hewson, who was a grade ahead of her.
She married Bono on 21 August 1982 in a Church of Ireland ceremony at All Saints Church, Raheny. In debt to U2's label, Island Records, the couple did not have ready funds for a honeymoon, but label head Chris Blackwell gave them use of the Goldeneye estate he owned in Jamaica. At first, the newly married couple shared a small mews house in Howth with the rest of the band. It took her a while to enjoy the band's music, as her own tastes ran toward her father's Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole records.
In 1992, Hewson participated in Greenpeace protests against the Sellafield plant for nuclear reprocessing, located across the Irish Sea in Cumbria, England. This involvement led her to become interested in the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986.
Since 1994, Hewson has been a patron of Chernobyl Children's Project International 
In 2005, Hewson, Bono and designer Rogan Gregory co-founded the Edun fashion label ("nude" spelled backwards, to suggest both "natural" and the Garden of Eden). It was intended to help bring about positive change in Africa through a fair trade-based relationship rather than by direct aid.
Songs written by Bono that were at least in part inspired by Ali go back to the earliest period of the band's recording career, with the track "Another Time, Another Place" off their 1980 first album, "Boy". She helped Bono get through a bad period of writer's block during the lead-up to the 1983 "War" album and especially in the lyric composition for "Sunday Bloody Sunday". She was the inspiration for the personal themes of "New Year's Day" on that record as well. The album and the accompanying War Tour brought financial success to the band, and Bono and Ali moved into a three-level, three-room Martello tower in Bray for some years. The group's 1984 song "Promenade" reflects both that location and the spiritual aspects of his desire for her.
The U2 song "Sweetest Thing" was written for Hewson as a gift because Bono forgot her birthday whilst recording with the band during "The Joshua Tree" sessions. Originally released as a B-side in 1987, it was later re-recorded and released as a single from the compilation album "The Best of 1980–1990" in 1998. Hewson agreed to appear in the single's music video as long as all proceeds from it went to Chernobyl Children's Project.

Madeiran wall lizard

The Madeira wall lizard ("Teira dugesii") or Madeira lizard is a species of lizard in the Lacertidae family, and the only member of the genus "Teira".
This Madeira wall lizard is endemic to the Madeira Islands, Portugal, where it is abundant. In the Azores, this lizard is found after involuntary introduction during the 19th century by ship trade between the two archipelagos, but the lizards have never reached the population numbers as in their territory of origin. There is also a small population in the port area of Lisbon, probably accidentally transported in ships carrying bananas, and first found in 1992; a study of 2001 found that the population has remained stable in size since its discovery.
The species was named after the French zoologist Louis Antoine Dugès (1797–1838).
The subspecies "Teira dugesii mauli" (Mertens, 1938) from the Desertas Islands now is a synonym of "Teira dugesii dugesii". "Atlantolacerta andreanskyi" (Andreansky's lizard) from Morocco, and "Scelarcis perspicillata" (Menorca wall lizard) from Morocco, Algeria and Minorca, were in the genus "Teira" but now are in other genera.
The species "Teira dugessii" presents three subspecies:
These lizards can reach in length, although adults have usually between . Their color can vary from light brown to dark gray, but with some of them (usually males) may show other colors, like green, blue and violet. Males can be easily distinguished from females due to the presence of a yellow at the bottom of the hind legs.
The females lay two to three groups of eggs annually. And some individuals could live to 16 years or more.
Despite being essentially an insectivorous species, ripe fruits and berries (especially blackberries) are also part of their diet.
This species is generally found in arid areas where the vegetation is not dense. It may also occur in open woodland, areas with rocks and where crops are grown.

Endogenous and exogenous

The Earth is shaped by many different geological processes. The forces that cause these processes come from both above and beneath the Earth's surface. Processes that are caused by forces from within the Earth are endogenous processes. By contrast, exogenous processes come from forces on or above the Earth's surface. Endo is a prefix meaning "in" while Exo is a prefix meaning "out".
There are three main endogenous processes: folding, faulting and volcanism. They take place mainly along the plate boundaries, which are the zones that lay on the edges of plates. These zones are weak. Endogenous processes cause many major landform features.
Many exogenous (extra-terrestrial) forces are as a result of other bodies in space. For example, the Moon causes tides in the Earth's oceans and other big bodies of water. Impacts from comets and meteoroids change the surface of the Earth. When they strike the Earth, they create craters which are holes, which can be very big or small, in the ground. Radiation from the Sun can cause aurorae, which are lights that can be seen at night near the poles.
An example of an exogenous process that is not as a result of bodies in space is erosion. Erosion happens as a result of wind, water, ice, or people, animals, or plants digging in the Earth. Some other examples of exogenous process are rainfall, snowfall, hailstorm, erosion ,tsunamis, avalanches, winds, wave currents etc.

Tonic immobility

Tonic immobility is a natural state of paralysis which animals enter, often called animal hypnosis. Its function is not certain. It may be related to mating in certain animals like sharks. It may also be a way of avoiding or deterring predators (playing dead is called thanatosis).
Tonic immobility has also been used for the paralysis which often immobilizes animals, such as rodents or birds when they feel threatened by a predator. Tonic immobility plays a role in survival if it helps a hunted animal to blend in with its surroundings. 
Tonic immobility can be induced without causing any apparent stress to the animal. For example, stroking a particular area of a lobster's shell or focusing a hen's attention on a line on the ground.
Tonic immobility has also been said to occur in humans that are subject to intense trauma such as rape or sexual assault. Catatonia in humans is a serious semi-permanent psychiatric state.
Some sharks can be placed in a tonic state. The shark remains in this state of paralysis for an average of fifteen minutes before it recovers. Scientists have exploited this phenomenon to study shark behaviour. The effects of chemical shark repellent have been studied to test effectiveness and to narrow down dose sizes, concentrations, and time to awaken. 
Some sharks go into tonic immobility when they are turned upsidedown. With tiger sharks 3–4 metres (10 to 15 feet) in length, tonic immobility may be achieved by placing hands lightly on the sides of the animal's snout approximate to the general area surrounding its eyes. Scientists believe that tonic immobility in sharks may be related to mating, because female sharks seem more responsive than males. During tonic immobility, the dorsal fin(s) straighten, and both breathing and muscle contractions become more steady and relaxed.
Great White Sharks are not so responsive as other species when tonic immobility has been attempted. In an interesting eye witness case off the coast of California, a female orca was seen holding the shark upside down to induce tonic immobility. It kept the shark still for fifteen minutes, causing it to suffocate to death. This was the first recorded eye witness case of predation on a great white shark in the wild by a species other than humans. Another case of orcas purposely inducing tonic immobility in fish has been seen with stingrays in New Zealand. In this case, the orcas turn themselves upside down before attacking, trap the stingrays in their mouths, then quickly right themselves, in turn flipping the stingray over, inducing the tonic immobility, rendering the fish helpless and an easy meal.
A chicken can be "hypnotized", or put into a trance, by holding its head down against the ground, and drawing a line along the ground with a stick or a finger, starting at the beak and extending straight outward in front of the chicken. If the chicken is hypnotized in this manner, it will remain immobile for somewhere between 15 seconds and 30 minutes, continuing to stare at the line. One theory is that the trance is caused by fear. which is probably a defensive mechanism intended to feign death, albeit rather poorly.
The first known written reference for this method came in 1646, in "Mirabile Experimentum de Imaginatione Gallinae" by Athanasius Kircher in Rome. 
One technique of hypnosis is to hold the chicken face up with its back on the ground, and then run a finger downwards from the chicken's wattles to just above its vent. The chicken's feet are exposed, which allows easy application of medication for foot mites, etc. Clapping hands or giving the chicken a gentle shove will awaken it.
One can also hypnotize a chicken by mimicking how it sleeps with its head under its wing. In this method, hold the bird firmly, placing its head under its wing, then, gently rock the chicken back and forth and set it very carefully on the ground. It should stay in the same position for about 30 seconds. H.B. Gibson, in his book "Hypnosis: its nature and therapeutic uses", says the record period for a chicken remaining in hypnosis is 3 hours 47 minutes.
Trout tickling is the art of rubbing the underbelly of a trout using fingers. If done properly, the trout will go into a trance-like state after a minute or so, and can then easily be thrown onto the nearest bit of dry land.
The rationale for the tonic immobility test is that the experimenter simulates a predator thereby eliciting an anti-predator response "death feigning". The precept is that the prey animal 'pretends' to be dead to be able to escape when/if the predator relaxes its concentration. Death feigning birds often take advantage of escape opportunities; tonic immobility in quail reduces the probability of the birds being predated by cats.
To induce tonic immobility, the animal is gently restrained on its side or back for a period of time, e.g. 15 seconds. This is done either on a firm, flat surface or sometimes in a purpose-built ‘V’ or ‘U’-shaped restraining cradle. In rodents, the response is sometimes induced by additionally pinching or attaching a clamp to the skin at the nape of the neck. Scientists record behaviours such as the number of inductions (15 second restraining periods) required for the animal to remain still, the latency to the first major movements (often cycling motions of the legs), latency to first head or eye movements and the duration of immobility, sometimes called the ‘righting time’. 
Tonic immobility has been used to show that hens in cages are more fearful than those in pens. Hens on the top tier of tiered battery cages are more fearful than those on the lower levels. Hens carried by hand are more fearful than hens carried on a mechanical conveyor. Hens transported for longer times are more fearful than those transported for shorter times.
Tonic immobility as a scientific tool has also been used with mice, gerbils, guinea pigs, rats, rabbits. and pigs.

Vasoconstriction

Vasoconstriction occurs when blood vessels become narrower because of the tightening of the muscles in their walls. Its opposite is vasodilation, which is when blood vessels widen. For example, when you are cold, blood vessels near the skin vasoconstrict so that you don't lose too much heat from your blood. 
When blood vessels vasoconstrict, this increases blood pressure. Sometimes, blood pressure is too high and this can cause heart disease, so people have to take medicine to make the muscles in the blood vessels relax.

"A Boy Named Sue" is a song written by Shel Silverstein. It was first made popular by Johnny Cash. Cash was at the height of his popularity when he recorded the song live at California's San Quentin State Prison at a concert on February 24, 1969. The concert was taped by Granada Television. It was later shown as a television program. Carl Perkins played guitar during the performance. 
The sound recording of the concert was later released on Cash's "At San Quentin" album by Columbia Records. Cash also sang the song as a comedy performance in December 1969 at Madison Square Garden. 
The song became Cash's biggest hit on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. It was his only top ten single there, spending three weeks at No. 2 in 1969. The track also topped the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts that same year. It was certified Gold on August 14, 1969, by the RIAA.
Shel Silverstein's recording was released the same year as "Boy Named Sue". It was a single on his album "Boy Named Sue (and His Other Country Songs)". It was produced by Chet Atkins and Felton Jarvis.
The story of the song was inspired by the writer Jean Shepherd, a close friend of Shel Silverstein. He was often made fun of as a child because of his feminine-sounding name.
In his autobiography, Cash wrote that he had just been given the song and only read it a couple of times. It was included in that concert just to try it out. He did not know the words when he first sang it. On the video recording, he can be seen regularly looking at a piece of paper. Cash was surprised at how well the song went over with the audience.

Triangular trade

The triangular trade refers to trade across the Atlantic Ocean between three ports or regions. Triangular trade usually develops when a region is exporting resources that are not needed in the region from which its main imports come. Instead, the resources are exported to a third region. The routes involved were historically also shaped by the winds and currents during the age of sailing ships.
The best-known triangular trading system was the Atlantic slave trade, which lasted from the late 16th to early 19th centuries. During this time, European countries such as Britain, Spain and France had colonies in the Americas and Africa. The ships carrying slaves, crops and manufactured goods between West Africa, the Caribbean and American colonies and the colonial powers in Europe. The use of African slaves was very important to growing colonial cash crops, which were exported to Europe. European goods, in turn, were used to buy African slaves, which were then brought west from Africa to the Americas to work on the crops. The middle passage of the triangular trade refers to the transportation of the slaves to america.
The Atlantic economy was tied into the idea of mercantilism, which thought it was a good idea for European countries to have a lot of colonies that traded only with them. Goods that were traded in the Atlantic economy were rum, slaves, sugar, tobacco, gold, spices, fish, lumber and manufactured goods.

Waistline (clothing)

The waistline is the part of a piece of clothing that sits on the wearer's waist. The actual position of the waitline can be different depending on the fashion or how the person chooses to wear the garment, but it is normally just above the hips. 
Waistlines can be secured with a variety of methods, such as buttons, knots and zippers. A waistband is a strip of elastic rubber that adjusts to keep the item tight against the body.

Heliocentrism

Heliocentrism is the idea that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun, which is the center of the solar system. Many people proposed heliocentrism, such as Aristarchus of Samos from ancient Greece, but Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to think of good reasons why it is true. This was the beginning of modern astronomy.
Before Copernicus, most people thought that the Sun and the other planets revolved around the Earth (this was called geocentrism). This is because if you stand on Earth, it looks like the Sun and stars are moving across the sky. However, when people watched for many years they saw many things that did not make sense if the Earth was the center of the Solar system. For example, sometimes the planets seemed to move back and forth instead of moving around the Earth. Copernicus explained why these things happen in 1543, when he published the book "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium" ("On the revolutions of the heavenly spheres"). This gave his reasons for thinking the Sun was at the center instead. 
Other astronomers who made further advances after Copernicus were Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei. For example, Kepler showed that the planets do not orbit in perfect circles, and Galileo built very good telescopes that helped to confirm the heliocentric model. 
Copernicus also thought that the sun was the center of the universe, but we now know that this is incorrect. The Sun is part of the Milky Way galaxy which is one out of billions of galaxies.

Trance

Trance describes a state of mind. A trance is when a person is conscious, and not sleeping, but is unaware of what is happening around him or her. 
The term "trance" is associated with hypnosis, meditation, magic, flow, religion, and certain kinds of music. It is an "altered state of consciousness".
There are many efforts to define what a trance is. Some think it is a borderland between normal consciousness and spirituality
The most straightforward example is when a person is hypnotized, they are in a trance. Conscious, and responding to the hypnotist, the person seems to block out other thoughts and other information. 
Another common example is the day-dream, where a person's mind drifts across private thoughts. Everyone daydreams, but young children constantly daydream, and have vivid imaginary fantasies. This is entirely normal. In the language of psychology, this kind of temporary separation from one's surroundings is called "dissociation". Research shows that a lot is going on when we daydream.
There are many examples of trance in religion. African animistic religions, such as that of the Yoruba, feature dances in celebration of the spirits. Under the influence of rhythm and song, a group dances, often for hours at a time. During this time, various members of the group may fall into trances, and some may act as if possessed by one of the spirits being worshiped. States of "spiritual ecstasy" are known in most forms of Christian worship. It is a main part of those aspects of religion known as "mysticism".

The Spitzer Space Telescope is a telescope launched into space by NASA in 2003. It is the fourth telescope in the Great Observatories program (the Hubble Space Telescope was the first). The Hubble Space Telescope takes pictures of visible light, and the Spitzer Space Telescope takes pictures of infrared light. Unlike Hubble, Spitzer orbits the Sun instead of the Earth.
The Spitzer Space Telescope is named after the scientist Lyman Spitzer. It was planned to last for 2.5 years, but it actually lasted until 2009. Some parts of the telescope are still working even today.
The Spitzer Space Telescope was able to see very good detail. Spitzer was the first telescope that could see light from extrasolar planets (planets outside the Solar System.) It was also able to see some of the first stars in the universe, believed to be only 100 million years after the Big Bang.

Age of the universe

In cosmology, the age of the universe is the amount of time since the Big Bang. The best measurement of the age of the Universe is 13.8 billion years (specifically, 13.798±0.037 billion years). The most recent and most accurate measurements were made by the Planck spacecraft. These measurements were made using the cosmic microwave background radiation and the expansion of the Universe.
In the 1800s, evidence from geology showed that the Earth was at least millions of years old. Later, it was thought that the universe was unchanging. However, in the 1920s, Georges Lemaître and Edwin Hubble determined that the universe was expanding (see Hubble's law). Although the estimates made using the initial data were low, radioactive dating on Earth could be used to give measurements of 11–20 billion years to 13–15 billion years. Eventually, scientists were able to make much better measurements using spacecraft.

NuSTAR is a telescope launched into space by NASA in 2012. It is the eleventh satellite in the "Small Explorer" program. Telescopes in space can see much better than on Earth, because the telescopes on Earth need to look through the atmosphere. 
NuSTAR measures high-energy X-rays, which have a much higher frequency than visible light. It uses special optical devices to do this, so it works differently from a normal telescope. This type of telescope is called a Wolter telescope.
NuSTAR is searching for black holes. It is also looking at supernovae to help understand how the chemical elements are created. One of the first discoveries made by NuSTAR, along with another space telescope called XMM-Newton, was to measure the spin rate of a supermassive black hole for the first time.

Carmelo Flores Laura (July 16, 1906 – June 9, 2014) was a centenarian from Bolivia. Laura claimed that he was 123 years old, but his actual age was proven to be 107 years. 
Laura was born on July 16, 1906 in Bolivia. 
Carmelo Flores Laura worked for the rancher who owned Frasquia, a rural area of Bolivia near Lake Titicaca, until 1952. At that time, the government seized the land and redistributed it to peasants such as Flores. He has lived there since, never traveling father than La Paz, from his home.
Flores had three children, one of which is alive as of 2013 (Cecilio, aged 67). He has 40 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren. His wife died in the 2000s. 
The Bolivian government is planning to officially honor Flores as "a living heritage" of the Bolivian people.
A police ID card and entry in the civil registry stating Flores was born on July 16, 1890 were shown to reporters. The longest fully documented lifespan in history is 122 years and 164 days, achieved by France's Jeanne Calment. 
Flores himself only said "I should be about 100 years old or more," when asked about his age. certificate that indicated Flores was actually 107 rather than his claimed age of 123.
Laura died in an Andean village in Bolivia, aged 107.

Darwin's finches are a group of birds that live on the Galápagos Islands. They are not actually finches, but they are a kind of passerine bird.
Charles Darwin used the finches to provide evidence for natural selection. He realized that the finches have different beaks because they are adapted to eat different kinds of food. For example, a finch with a big beak is very good at cracking open nuts, and a finch with a long beak is very good at catching insects. Darwin was able to see that the finches had a common ancestor which is why they were so similar except for their beaks. Eventually, this led to the theory of evolution.

Sorry guys I was busy these days. But my logic is we should welcome users . I saw that in most cases you don't welcome users personally then why it's problem with a bot? Also the bot will welcome only those users who've contributions and username blacklist is enabled. But I think we shouldn't wait for contributions. But I'll leave this to you. I'm proposing this for my experience. I've created my account at 26 January 2012. But I never knew that I can edit. I started editing at August of that year. If someone or a bot welcomed me maybe I would started earlier. That's why I'm saying users should be welcomed. The welcome template contains all the rules of a wiki. So an AGF user will know the policy and will edit well. Now still if you don't like then please kindly say to the that you don't allow welcoming bot. It'll be good in future.-- 14:38, 5 August 2013 (UTC)

Fugue state

A fugue state (dissociative fugue or psychogenic fugue) is a rare psychiatric disorder. It involves temporary loss of memory (amnesia). It usually only lasts a short time (from hours to days), but can last months or longer. In a fugue state, the person not only forgets all about who they are, but may suddenly adopt a new identity. They may leave home and wander, settle in another area with a new name. Fugue occurs to avoid stress and anxiety. After the fugue state comes to an end, the person recovers the memories they lost, but usually forgets all that happened during the fugue.

Pico do Fogo

Pico do Fogo ("Fire peak") is the highest peak of Cape Verde, rising to above sea level. It is an active stratovolcano lying on the island of Fogo. The last eruption of the main volcanic cone was in 1675 and all the people living in the island had to leave.
A lateral vent (the opening of a volcano from which lava flows) erupted in 1995. The only deadly eruption was in 1847 when earthquakes produced in all the island claimed several lives. Volcanic lava has reached the eastern coast of the island in historical times.
Its most spectacular feature is a volcanic crater (or caldera, "caldeira" in Portuguese) that is about wide, with a border ("bordeira" in Portuguese) that is about high. The crater has a slit in its eastern wall, and a large peak like a volcanic cone rises in its center that. The central cone is the highest point of the island (2829 m) and its peak is about 100 m higher than the "bordeira" that surrounds the crater.
The lowest elevation of the floor of the "caldeira", known as "Chã das Caldeiras" ("Plain of the Calderas") is . There are, within the "caldeira", two villages which were evacuated during the last eruption. Traditionally, grapes are grown on the inner slopes of the "bordeira" and there is some subsistence agriculture on the "caldeira" floor.
The mountain's slopes are used to grow coffee, while its lava is used as building material.
The Fea's petrel ("Pterodroma feae"), a Near Threatened species of bird, breeds in this mountain.
The endemic plants "Echium vulcanorum" and "Erysimum caboverdeanum" are only known to occur on the outer rim of the volcano.

<doc id="413760" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=413760" title="Geoffrey II of Anjou">
Geoffrey II of Anjou

Geoffrey II, called Martel ("the Hammer"), was a French nobleman who was the Count of Anjou from 1040 to 1060. He was the last count who was a male line descendant of Ingelger. The countship passed through his sister Ermengarde-Blanche of Anjou to her son Geoffrey III.
Geoffrey was born 14 October 1006. He was the son of Fulk the Black and Hildegard of Lorraine. As the count of Vendome, Geoffrey married Agnes of Burgundy. About 1038 Geoffrey was asked by Herbert Braco to help him against Gervais, the Bishop of Le Mans. During the short war between them Geoffrey broke his hip. This caused Geoffrey to have to transfer some of his vassals to Bishop Gervais.
At his father's death in 1040 Geoffrey Martel succeeded him. Along with king Henry I of France Geoffrey maintained a war against the count Theobald of Blois. As the power of Blois was reduced the power of Anjou increased. But Geoffrey became too powerful and by the late 1040s the king turned against him. 
About 1047 Geoffrey began to look to the north for more land. Geoffrey attacked the castle of Château-du-Loir owned by Bishop Gervais. He did not capture the castle but burned some of it. Geoffrey did capture Bishop Gervais who he threw in prison. The Council of Reims in 1049 ordered Geoffrey to release his captive bishop or they would excommunicate him. Even when the pope did excommunicate Geoffrey the following year he would not release the Bishop. 
Geoffrey next acquired the castles of Alençon and Domfront on the southern border of Normandy. From there he raided into Normandy. In 1051 Duke William moved against Domfront but was not able to defeat the fortress. William then set up a siege of the castle to force it to surrender. This caused Geoffrey to leave Maine and return to Anjou. 
In early 1052 a political shift occurred. King Henry I reconciled with Geoffrey Martel and about the same time he turned against Duke William of Normandy. 
In the same year, 1052, when the count of Maine, Hugh, died Geoffrey took over Maine without a fight. He ruled Maine until his death. Bishop Gervaise finally purchased his freedom from Geoffrey by giving him Château-du-Loir and promising not to return to Le Mans. Gervais went to the court of Duke William of Normandy. Another event in 1052 in Normandy would bring King Henry and Count Geoffrey together against William of Normandy. William of Arques, a vassal and relative of Duke William rebelled. In 1053 the king, along with Geoffrey of Anjou entered Normandy to assist William of Arques against Duke William. The duke had laid siege to the castle of Arques. But the relief effort failed and King Henry and count Geoffrey were forced to leave Normandy. In 1054 the King, accompanied by Geoffrey Martel again raided into Normandy. The king's brother, Odo, led a second force which attacked Normandy from the west. Odo's forces were defeated causing the king and count Geoffrey to leave Normandy again. 
In 1058 Geoffrey was visited by the king in Anjou. The two planned their next attacks on Normandy. In August of that year the two led a combined force into Normandy to pillage and burn what they could. At a crossing of the Dives River their force was caught by the rising tide. Geoffrey and the king were on the other side when the bulk of their army was attacked and defeated by Duke William. All Geoffrey and the king could do was leave Normandy as fast as they could. The king's death in the summer of 1060 and Geoffrey's death in November of that same year ended their wars.
Geoffrey II's first wife was Agnes of Burgundy, the widow of William V of Aquitaine; she and Geoffrey married in 1032, but had divorced by 1050. 
His second wife was named Grace. 
His third wife was Adèle, the daughter of a "Count Odo" of Blois.
His last wife was Adelaide "La Teutonne".
Geoffrey died childless.

Family International

Family International, which had been called The Children of God, The Family of Love and The Family, is a New Age religion, and a cult. It was started in the 1960s in California by David Brandt Berg (1919–1994). 
The Children of God (1968–1977)
The Family of Love (1978–1981)
The Family (1982–1994)
The Family International (2004–today)
Broadly, the Family are a Christian evangelical movement. However, their beliefs are selective. Their "spiritual revolution" is against the outside world, which the members called "the System". After the death of the founder, his widow Karen Zerby became the leader of TFI, taking the title of 'Queen' and 'prophetess.' She married Steve Kelly, an assistant of David Berg whom Berg had chosen as her 'consort' before his death. Steve Kelly took the title of 'King Peter' and became the public face of TFI, speaking in a more public capacity than either David Berg or Karen Zerby.
In 1974, the group began a method of evangelism called Flirty Fishing. This meant using sex to "show God's love" and win converts. The method was apparently exrtemely successful. According to TFI, as a result of Flirty Fishing, "over 100,000 received God's gift of salvation through Jesus, and some chose to live the life of a disciple and missionary".
The group encouraged children to have sex with adults and each other. The High Court of Justice, Family Division, in the UK found there to be "widespread sexual abuse of young children and teenagers by adult members of The Family". According to data provided by TFI to researcher Bill Bainbridge, from 1974 until 1987, members had sexual contact with 223,989 people while practicing Flirty Fishing. Flirty Fishing also resulted in the births of many children, including Karen Zerby's son, Davidito (aka Ricky Rodriguez). He committed suicide after murdering a female member of the cult who had sexually abused him as a toddler. Children born as result of Flirty Fishing were referred to as "Jesus Babies". By the end of 1981, more than 300 "Jesus Babies" had been born.
In his judgment of a child custody court case in England in 1994, after extensive research of COG publications and the testimony of numerous witnesses, Lord Justice Sir Alan Ward said this about Flirty Fishing:
Flirty Fishing was officially abandoned in 1987. After some complaints from people who had been abused as children by adults, a new rule, that sexual interactions should not occur between an adult and a minor, was encouraged and promoted, but not enforced.
In March 1989, TF issued a statement which stated that, in "early 1985" an urgent memorandum was sent to all of its members "reminding them that any such activities [adult-child sexual contact] are strictly forbidden within our group". In January 2005, Claire Borowik, spokesperson for TFI, issued a statement that said, "Due to the fact that our current zero-tolerance policy regarding sexual interaction between adults and underage minors was not clearly stated in our literature published before 1986, we came to the realization that during a transitional stage of our movement, from 1978 until 1986, there were cases when some minors were subject to sexually inappropriate advances... This was corrected officially in 1986, when any contact between an adult and minor (any person under 21 years of age) was declared an excommunicable offense".

Geoffrey III, Count of Anjou

Geoffrey III of Anjou (1040–1096), called "le Barbu" ("the Bearded"), was a French nobleman who was the Count of Anjou 1060-68.
Geoffrey III, born , was the oldest son of Geoffrey II, Count of Gâtinais and Ermengarde-Blanche of Anjou. Ermengarde-Blanche was the daughter of Fulk III of Anjou. Both he and his younger brother Fulk, called "le Réchin", were raised at the court of their uncle, Geoffrey Martel. Both Geoffrey and Fulk were knighted by him in 1060. Geoffrey was well treated by his uncle but the count may have favored his younger nephew, Fulk. Nonetheless Geoffrey became his heir to succeed him as count of Anjou. Geoffrey III reigned as Count of Anjou until the was taken from him by his brother, Fulk.
He succeeded his uncle Geoffrey Martel in 1060, but it soon became clear to his vassals he was not a very good count. Geoffrey Martel left his younger brother, Fulk, Saintonge as an appanage. In 1062, when Saintonge was attacked by Count Guy-Geoffrey of Poitou, Geoffrey did nothing to help Fulk and Saintonge was lost. In 1063 the county of Maine was lost to Anjou as well. In 1064 Geoffrey failed to come to the aid of one of his vassals, Rainaldus of Chateau-Gontier, who was captured by the Bretons. In 1065 Geoffrey angered Archbishop Barthelemy of Tours by trying to force his own choice for Bishop of Le Mans on the church. In turn the archbishop excommunicated Geoffrey. 
As the situation in Anjou became worse Fulk argued with his brother Geoffrey. Finally, in 1067, Fulk rebelled and took the county away from Geoffrey, briefly imprisoning him. In 1068 Geoffrey attacked Fulk, and once again he was defeated. This time Geoffrey was imprisoned where he remained for 28 years. Geoffrey was finally freed by the intervention of Pope Urban II in 1096. But Geoffrey died soon after his release.
Geoffrey married Julienne de Langeais before 1060. She died after 7 August 1067. They had no children.

Ermengarde-Blanche of Anjou

Ermengarde-Blanche of Anjou (–1076), was a French noblewoman who was first Countess of Chateau-Landon and secondly Duchess of Burgundy. She is also called "Hermangarde" in some sources. Ermengarde-Blanch was the heiress of the of Anjou and is an of the House of Plantagenet. 
Ermengarde-Blanche was the daughter of Count Fulk III of Anjou and Hildegarde. She was involved in two marriage alliances that greatly benefited her father and brother as counts of Anjou. She was first contracted to marry Geoffrey II, Count of Gâtinais, called "Ferréol", who was also lord of Château-Landon. It was important marriage to return Château-Landon to the counts of Anjou. It took between twelve and eighteen months to arrange the marriage. Meanwhile Fulk paid a great deal of attention to Château-Landon. He and his wife, Hildegarde, founded the abbey of Le Ronceray. Originally a church dedicated to St. Mary, Hildegard was very active in its rebuilding into an abbey. They gave the abbey many gifts including the forest of Lattay. They gave more gifts to this abbey than any other church or religious house. Her two sons of this marriage, Geoffrey III and Fulk both became counts of Anjou after her brother Geoffrey II Martel. Among her descendants are the Plantagenet (or Angevin) kings of England.
After her husband Geoffrey died Ermengarde-Blanche married Robert I Capet, Duke of Burgundy. Robert was the son of King Robert II of France. Because both Ermengarde and her second husband Robert Capet were both descendants of Ingelger, they were related by blood. This was found in charts prepared at the of Saint-Aubin at Angers between 1048 and 1052. The charts show how closely the Angevin and Capet families were related. The charts were probably created over concerns of who Ermengarde and Robert's daughter Hildegarde could or could not marry. Ermengarde-Blanche died at Fleury-sur-Ouche on 18 March 1076. Robert died three days later at the same place on 21 March 1076.
Together she and Geoffrey II had the following children: 
She married secondly Robert I, Duke of Burgundy. Together they had a daughter:

In 1965, when the country was facing one of its worst political, social, and economic crises—a result of dictatorial misrule—he founded a new political party in Quito called the Democratic Institutionalist Coalition (Coalición Institucionalista Demócrata, CID). 
One year later, he was elected Deputy of the Constituent Assembly held by "President" Yerovi Indaburu. The Constituent Assembly elected Arosemena President of Ecuador on November 16, 1966.
Arosemena's political adversaries later attacked his policies, particularly with respect to oil policy. He responded by writing the book Infamy and Truth (Infamia y verdad), in which he addresses his administration's oil policy.
Arosemena was born on 19 July 1925 in Guayaquil, Ecuador. He studied at University of Guayaquil. Arosemena died on 20 April 1984 in Salinas, Ecuador from complications of a fall, aged 58.

The division includes the towns of Bathurst, Blayney, Canowindra, Eugowra, Forbes, Lithgow, Molong, Oberon, Orange, Parkes, Peak Hill, Portland, Wallerawang and Yeoval.
Peter Andren was not a candidate for the 2007 election as he was going to stand for a Senate seat. He was diagnosed with cancer in 2007 and died during the election campaign.

The Division of Charlton is an Australian Electoral Division in New South Wales. It was created in 1984 and is named for Matthew Charlton, leader of the Australian Labor Party 1922-28. It covers the Hunter Region area of New South Wales. It includes the towns of Cardiff, Wallsend, Toronto, Morisset, Cooranbong, Glendale and Warners Bay.
In October 2015 the Australian Electoral Commission said the division would be renamed at the next election. Because of population changes New South Wales loses one division, and a new one will be created in Western Australia. To abolish a seat, the boundaries in New South Wales will have to be redrawn. The Division of Hunter will be abolished. Under the AEC rules, the names of original 1901 divisions are kept where possible. This means the area now covered by Charlton, will be included in a new division, renamed Hunter.
Greg Combet had been Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). He was Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency in the Gillard Government. In the 2013 election, the Liberal Party candidate, Kevin Baker, resigned after being involved with an offensive website. This happened after nominations closed, so the Liberal Party could not select a new candidate and Baker's name was still on the ballot papers.

Harmonic analysis

Harmonic analysis is a branch of mathematics that looks at the theoretical foundations of digital signal processing. A continuous signal can be drawn as a wave, or as a combination of several waves. Fourier transforms and Fourier series are among the main tools used for signal analysis. Today, this field has many uses, which also include quantum mechanics and neuroscience. 
In essence, harmonic analysis looks at locally compact groups. The Lebesgue measure is a way to assign a measurement to a subset of the Euclidean space. For real numbers there is the Haar measure, which can perform this task. This measure allows to use Fourier analysis to model the groups and their properties. 
The term "harmonics" is also related to Eigenvalues, in the case where the frequency of one wave is an integer multiple of the frequency of another wave. This is the case of the harmonics that are used for musical notes. Later the term was generalized.

Frank Kameny

Franklin Edward "Frank" Kameny (May 21, 1925 – October 11, 2011) was an important person in the American gay rights movement. 
Kameny was born on May 21, 1925 in New York City, New York. He studied at Richmond Hill High School and at Queens College.
In 1957, Kameny was fired from his position as an astronomer in the U.S. Army's Army Map Service in Washington, D.C. because of his homosexuality. This helped him to begin "a Herculean struggle with the American establishment" that would help a rights movement of the early 1960s for homosexuals.
Kameny protested his firing by the U.S. Civil Service Commission due to his homosexuality, and argued this case to the United States Supreme Court in 1961. Although the court denied his petition, it is notable as the first civil rights claim based on sexual orientation. 
Kameny died on October 11, 2011 in Washington, D.C. from heart disease. He was 86 years old.
Following Kameny's death, the giant rainbow flag on the tall flagpole at the corner of Market Street and Castro Street in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco was flown at half-staff for 24 hours beginning on the afternoon of October 12, 2011 at the request of the creator of the rainbow flag, Gilbert Baker.
On November 2, 2011, Kameny's house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
On July 3 2012, Minor Planet (40463) "Frankkameny" was named in Kameny's honor by the International Astronomical Union and the Minor Planet Center.

Echium vulcanorum

Echium vulcanorum is a plant species that belongs to the Boraginaceae family, the borage family. It is found only in the Fogo island, Cape Verde.
It was discovered and named by the French botanist Auguste Jean Baptiste Chevalier. He found the plant with flowers on July 1934.
It is locally known as "lingua de vaca" ("tongue of cow") because their leaves are rough. The same name is used for the other species of "Echium" that are found in Cape Verde: "Echium hypertropicum" and "Echium stenosiphon".
It is a shrub with many branches, up to 1.5-2 m tall. The stems are covered with many hairs. The leaves are lanceolates (pointed at both ends) up to 10 cm long and 1.5 wide.
The flowers are in dense inflorescences (groups of flowers), almost conical, up to 18 cm long, with white flowers with blue stripes.
"Echium vulcanorum" is endemic of the Cape Verdean island of Fogo on the volcano "Pico do Fogo". It occurs on volcanic soils of Fogo Island, mainly as two populations at Monte Losna/Pico Novo, where they can be found at about 1700 m, and in the border of the crater of the "Pico do Fogo" (the "Bordeira" region ) at altitudes between 2200 and 2400 m. A small population was also reported in "Chã das Caldeiras" (±1600 m). These populations exist generally in places facing to the southwest or the southeast. It prefers soils with a recent volcanic origin. 
"Echium vulcanorum" is used for the production of (dry wood that will be burned) and destroyed by goats, so this species, as well as the other two "Echium" species of Cape Verde, is seriously threatened, so that measures for its protection should be taken with urgency.
Some conservation actions have been done at the "Bordeira region" (in the Natural Park of Fogo Island) and now there is a population with a relatively high number of individuals.

Manila hostage crisis

The Manila hostage crisis (Tagalog: Pagbibihag ng bus sa Maynila; Chinese: 馬尼拉人質事件) happened on August 23, 2010. A man who had been fired from the Philippine National Police, Rolando del Rosario Mendoza, came onto a tourist bus in Rizal Park and took the passengers hostages. Nine people (including 8 tourists from Hong Kong, killed by Mendoza, and Mendoza himself) were killed in the incident.
Since Hong Kong people blamed the Philippines Government for not handling the incident properly, the relationship between Hong Kong and the Philippines had become much worse.
Generally speaking, the society of Philippines is not in good order as there are robberies and kidnappings almost every day.
It is allowed by law of the Philippines that each citizen own a handgun and a shotgun. Former policemen can continue to keep their weapons.
Rolando del Rosario Mendoza was formerly a policeman. In 2008, he was fired because of complaints that he forced an arrested chef to admit drug trafficking that he had never done. 
When he came aboard the tourist bus, he posted a sticker to the bus stating "BIG MISTAKE TO CORRECT A BIG WRONG DECISION".
The tour group was held by Hong Thai Travel. It set off on 20 August. The day when the incident happen was the last day of the tour. That day was also the Ghost Festival of China.
 "Note that the time mentioned in this chapter is 8 hours faster than the UTC."
About 10 o'clock, Mendoza came apart the bus by force. At that time, he let the tour guide and the hostage contact their households. The tour guide, Tse Ting Chunn, phoned the Assistant Manger, "依家有咗好大鑊嘅問題……有個軍人上咗我部車挾持咗我哋成部車，佢有兩把槍。(There is a serious incident. A solider came apart our bus and took us as hostage. He has two gun.)" The manger told him to make the tourist be calm.
At 2 pm, a younger brother of Mendoza came. A police officer took his gun. Mendoza got angry and shouted. At 9 pm, he started killing the tourists. First, he killed the tour guide. Next, he shot at Yik Siu Ling. She pretended to be dead. Then, some of the tourists decided to subdue him, but they were shot. After that, he kept on shooting at the tourists.
About 7 pm, The Philippine National Police signed the reinstatement order of Mendoza. However, because of the traffic jam, the document wasn't deliver to him on time. When the document was delivered, he had already killed many tourists.
The tour guide and six tourists were shot by The Punisher and Mendoza died. Mendoza himself was shot by the The Punisher afterwards. In the incident, seven tourists were hurt. Some of them are still staying at the hospital or undergoing surgery today. Mike Yadrillo y Campanero, a citizen in the Philippines and a staff of TVB were also injured during the shootings. 
The government of the Philippines agreed that the killed tourists were murdered.
On 5 November 2013, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, CY Leung, has claimed that if no progress are made in a month, there will be sanctions to the Philippines.
On 29 January 2014, Hong Kong has canceled visa-free privileges for Philippine officials. However, Aquino III, the president of the Philippines, still refuses to apologize for the incident.
The official website of Bulacan, a city of the Philippines, was hacked. The background music was changed to the national anthem of the People's Republic of China and text was added which requested the government to apologize.
After the accident, some of the bodies of the killed tourists had been mixed up. Also, the staff of the funeral house opened the coffins and let journalists take photos. Such events made the Hong Kong people very more angry. Ironically, Mendoza's funeral was held at his home and his coffin was covered by the national flag of the Philippines. This added anger to the people of Hong Kong. A "netizen" of Hong Kong even joked that the Philippine flag could be used as doormat. 
At last, the Philippines Government said that the flag was used improperly. They had already asked the households of Mendoza to remove the flag.
Tse Ting Chunn, the tour guide, was buried in Diamond Hill Crematorium. Three tourist were buried at St. Raphael's Catholic Cemetery temporarily. The others were buried in Tribute Garden.
The Philippine Police were criticized for the followings:
When a injured tourist was on an ambulance, he asked for a bandage. However, a nurse told him to cover the wound himself.
Another injured tourist was sent to the Manila Doctors Hospital. However, a guard didn't let her in. Finally, when she was being transferred to the Manila City Hospital, she died.
The Government had set up public places for mourning, and also a Facebook page. 。
Mourning masses were held in churches. 
Many websites of Hong Kong turned their logos gray. "A Symphony of Lights", a firework and light show held every evening at 8:00 pm in Hong Kong was suspended.
A joint demonstration march was held by the policial parties such as the Democratic Party, the Civic Party, Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, and Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong.
On 25 August, different religious organizations held Puja and mass. Upajjhayas of Fo Guang Shan, a Taiwanese temple, prayed for peace. The Archbishop of Manila led a prayer and 200 police officers lit candles for the dead in a mourning ceremony.
Fernando Chui Sai On, chief executive of Macau, wrote a condolence letter to Donald Tsang, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong then. The Encyclopedia of Virtual Communities in Macau turned its logo gray.
In 2013, household of the died tour guide and some of the the injured filed a petition to the High Court. The petition is against the government of the Philippines, former mayor of Manila and 7 other units.
Two of the injured also filed a petition, but it was against the Hong Thai Travel.
At 21:45 on 23 August 2008, Security Bureau had raised the Outbound Travel Alert for the Philippines to Black.
In the first two months after the incident, 4000 pesos of tourist receipts were lost. In August 2010, about 12,000 tourists were from Hong Kong. However, in September, there were only about 7000 tourists form Hong Kong.
Jackie Chan, an actor, said that Hong Kong people had forgiven the Philippine Police. Many "netizens" in Hong Kong disagreed his comment and condemned him. Later, his blog had an entry about his own café in the Philippines welcomed by the Philippine policemen. He later apologized. 
One year after the crime, Wong Koon Chung, a singer, said that he would support killing the Philippine President Aquino III and cursing him with foul language. He later took back his speech. 
A Hong Kong TV station, TVB, played "Can't Buy Me Love", a comedy, after the live show of the hostage incident. TVB had received complaints afterwards.
However, there were comments that comedies could make the audience relaxed.

She is the daughter of the jötunn (giant) Gymir and Aurboda; the sister of Beli; the wife of Frey, whose servant Skirnir, wooed and won her for his master. Gerðr spurned apples and gold but finally gave in at the terrible threat of eternal cold and loneliness, thus personifying winter giving in at last to the warm sunshine of spring. The nine nights of waiting between her consent to become Frey’s bride and the actual union is symbolic of the long nine months of hard winter in northern countries before spring arrives.

Geoffey, born was the oldest son of Fulk IV Réchin and his second wife Ermengarde of Bourbon. She was the daughter of Archambaud IV, Sire de Bourbon. In his youth his bravery in battle won him the nickname "Martel the second". He was so named after his Geoffrey II of Anjou. Elias I, Count of Maine intended to go on crusade with Robert "Curthose", Duke of Normandy, who had already left. Elias asked Robert's brother William Rufus for protection for a crusader's lands while he was away. William flatly refused and made it known he wanted Maine (province) for himself. Elias was then captured, brought to William Rufus in chains and . Geoffrey IV had been contracted to marry Elias's daughter, Eremburge. Geoffrey hurried to Maine to defend against any attacks by William Rufus. At the same time his father created a on the border of Normandy. Elias however, did not trust Fulk Réchin and agreed to give William Rufus control of Maine for his release. William Rufus took Maine back and held it until his death in 1100.
In 1096 Geoffrey IV's father released his brother Geoffrey III the legitimate but deposed count of Anjou. This was through the intervention of Pope Urban II in 1096. The pope directed that Geoffrey IV Martel was to take over the countship of Anjou. Fulk IV consented to stepping down and making his son count of Anjou. According to Orderic Vitalis Geoffrey restored peace in Anjou and was a very effective count for several years. In 1103 Fulk le Réchin disinherited his son Geoffrey. He favored his younger son by Bertrade de Montfort, Fulk "Le June". By now Fulk le Réchin was old but he still tried to regain control of the countship. There was some brief fighting. Fulk le Réchin was supported by his son-in-law William IX, Duke of Aquitaine. Geoffrey Martel was supported by Elias I, Count of Maine. In the end Fulk le Réchin lost and Geoffrey remained the count of Anjou. Three years later Geoffrey was laying siege to Candé. When the rebels wanted to negotiate for peace and surrender. While Geoffrey was discussing the situation suddenly a crossbowman shot a bolt (short arrow) from the castle and hit Geoffrey in the arm. Geoffrey died the next day, 11 May 1106. Geoffrey died unmarried.

Chevalier named, in 1935, this species as "Matthiola caboverdeana"; this name now is a synonym because Sunding changed it to the present name, "Erysimum caboverdeanum".
It is locally known as "crabo bravo" ("wild carnation") and "alecrim branco" ("white rosemary").
"Erysimum caboverdeanum" is a biennial small bush, up to high; its stems are woody and they stand upright. The narrow leaves are about long and wide and their margins are finely ed.
The flowers, which are white or lilac coloured, are in groups (inflorescences) at the end of the stems. The fruits are very narrow and stand upright.
"Erysimum caboverdeanum" is an endemic species of the Cape Verdean island of Fogo on the volcano "Pico do Fogo". It is common in soils with a recent volcanic origin at an altitude between ; it is found on the slopes of the volcano and in the "Chã das Caldeiras", the plain in the volcanic crater.
The species is used for traditional medicinal purposes mainly as an infusion.
It is possible to use it as an ornamental plant, even in places like central Europe.

Santorini caldera

Santorini caldera is a large, mostly submerged caldera. It is in Greece, in the southern Aegean Sea, 120 kilometers north of Crete. Visible above water is the circular Santorini island group.
The caldera measures about , with high steep cliffs on three sides. There are two small volcanic islands at the center of the caldera, Nea ("New") Kameni and Palea ("Old") Kameni. The main island, Santorini has an area of km2.
The extraordinary beauty of Santorini's high walls, draped by whitewashed villages, combined with a sunny climate and clear air, have made it a magnet for tourists and volcanologists. 
The volcanic complex of Santorini is the most active part of the South Aegean Volcanic Arc. This marks the subduction of the African tectonic plate underneath the Aegean part of the Eurasian tectonic plate, at a rate of up to 5 cm per year in a northeasterly direction. It has earthquakes at depths of 150–170 km.
Non-volcanic rocks are exposed on Santorini at the Profitis Ilias Mountain, Mesa Vouno, the Gavrillos ridge, Pirgos, Monolithos and the inner side of the caldera wall between Cape Plaka and Athinios.
The Kameni islands at the center of the caldera are made of lava rocks.
The caldera is composed of overlapping shield volcanoes, cut by at least four partially overlapping calderas, of which the oldest southern caldera was formed about 180,000 years ago. The subsequent Skaros caldera was created about 70,000 years ago, and the Cape Riva caldera about 21,000 years ago. The current caldera was formed about 3600 years ago during the Minoan eruption.
Palea Kameni and Nea Kameni were formed as a result of multiple, initially submarine eruptions at the center of the caldera.
Although dormant, Santorini is an active volcano. Numerous minor and medium-sized, mainly effusive eruptions have built the dark-colored lava shields of Nea and Palea Kameni inside the caldera.
Their last eruption was in 1950, and now only smoke and gases come out. GPS instruments have registered renewed deformation around the caldera in 2011 and 2012. 
The huge Minoan eruption of Santorini in the 17th century BC may have inspired the legend of Atlantis. It was rated 7, the highest score for a historical eruption, in the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program's Volcanic Explosivity Index.

Coptic language

Coptic or Coptic Egyptian is the latest stage of the Egyptian language. It is a northern Afro-Asiatic language spoken in Egypt until at least the 17th century. 
Egyptian began to be written using the Greek alphabet in the 1st century. The new writing system became the Coptic script, an adapted Greek alphabet with the addition of six or seven signs from the demotic script to represent Egyptian sounds the Greek language did not have. The two most common dialects are Sahidic and Bohairic.
Coptic and demotic Egyptian are very similar to the earlier Egyptian language written in the hieroglyphic script. Coptic flourished as a literary language from the 2nd to 13th centuries, and its Bohairic dialect continues to be the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. It was supplanted by Egyptian Arabic as a spoken language toward the early modern period. The Copts have tried to revive the language since the 19th century.

Mixed forests are a temperate and humid biome. The forests have four layers. The uppermost layer is the forest canopy of tall, mature trees from 33 to 66 m (100 to 200 feet) high. 
Below the canopy is the three-layered understory, about 9 to 15 m (30 to 50 feet) shorter than the canopy. The top layer of the understory has smaller mature trees, saplings. There are also suppressed juvenile canopy layer trees waiting for an opening in the canopy. Below the sub-canopy is the shrub layer of low-growing woody plants. Most of the time, the lowest growing (and most diverse) layer is the ground cover or herbaceous layer.

Ancient woodland

Ancient woodland is the term used in the United Kingdom for woodland which has existed continuously since 1600 or before in England and Wales (or 1750 in Scotland). Before those dates, planting of new woodland was uncommon, so a wood present in 1600 was likely to have developed naturally. The analogous American term is "old growth forest".
For many species of animal and plant, ancient woodland sites provide the only habitat. For many others, conditions on these sites are much more suitable than those on other sites. Ancient woodland in the UK, like rainforest in the tropics, is home to rare and threatened species, more than any other UK habitat. For these reasons ancient woodland is often described as an irreplaceable resource, or 'critical natural capital'.
Ancient woodland is formally defined on maps by Natural England and equivalent bodies. Many ancient woodlands have legal protection, but an ancient woodland is not automatically protected.

Bluebell wood

A bluebell wood is a woodland that in springtime has a carpet of flowering bluebells ("Hyacinthoides non-scripta") underneath a newly forming leaf canopy. The thicker the summer canopy, the more the ground-cover is suppressed. This encourages a dense carpet of bluebells, whose leaves mature and die down by early summer.
Bluebell woods may be found in all parts of Great Britain and Ireland, as well as elsewhere in Europe. Bluebells are a common indicator species for ancient woodlands, so bluebell woods are likely to date back to at least 1600.
Gerard Manley Hopkins, one of the romantic poets, was very keen on bluebells, as his poem "May Magnificat" shows.

Wood banks and brakes wash wet like lakes</poem>
In his journal entry for 9 May 1871 Hopkins says:
In the little wood opposite the light they stood in blackish spreads or sheddings like spots on a snake. The heads are then like thongs and solemn in grain and grape-colour. But in the clough through the light they come in falls of sky-colour washing the brows and slacks of the ground with vein-blue, thickening at the double, vertical themselves and the young grass and brake-fern combed vertical, but the brake struck the upright of all this with winged transomes. It was a lovely sight. - The bluebells in your hand baffle you with their inscape, made to every sense. If you draw your fingers through them they are lodged and struggle with a shock of wet heads; the long stalks rub and click and flatten to a fan on one another like your fingers themselves would when you passed the palms hard across one another, making a brittle rub and jostle like the noise of a hurdle strained by leaning against; then there is the faint honey smell and in the mouth the sweet gum when you bite them.

Auguste Jean Baptiste Chevalier

Auguste Jean Baptiste Chevalier was a French botanist, and explorer of tropical Africa, especially of French Africa and Côte d'Ivoire.
Chevalier was born on 23 June 1873 in Domfront, a town in Orne, Lower Normandy, France. His family had a small farm in Normandy and he studied first in Domfront and then in Caen.
He finished high school in 1891 and began to study at Caen University and, in 1893, Élie Antoine Octave Lignier, botanist at the university, put him in charge of making the catalog of the university herbarium.
After his military service in 1894, he got his degree in natural sciences in 1896 and he began to work with the botanist Charles Eugene Bertrand at the University of Lille. In 1897, he got a scholarship, allowing him to enter the botanical laboratory of Philippe Van Tieghem at the National Museum of Natural History. From 1899 to 1900, he was part of a scientific travel to Sudan.
Chevalier got a doctorate in 1901 and then made many scientific travels, mainly to Africa but also to tropical Asia and to South America. He became an assistant in the Colonial Agriculture Laboratory of the "École pratique des hautes études" (an establishment of research and higher education); in 1907 he became the deputy director of the institution and then in 1912 was made director of it.
In 1921, he began publishing the journal "Revue de Botanique Appliquée", in French, where he wrote many articles.
In 1929 he was made professor of crop production at the National Museum of Natural History of France; he remained here until his retirement in 146. He became a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1937.
After his death in 1956, the Domfront municipality gave his name to the high school of the city in 1959.

Oh! Susanna

"Oh! Susanna" is a song by Stephen Foster. It was Foster's first hit song. The song debuted in the Eagle Ice Cream Saloon in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on September 11, 1847 and was published by W. C. Peters of Cincinnati, Ohio in 1848. It became the unofficial anthem of the California Gold Rush in 1849.
Foster had little appreciation of the worth of his songs. His brother Morrison wrote: "While in Cincinnati [Stephen] wrote "Oh, Susanna", a song which soon became famous ... There was then in Cincinnati in the music business, W. C. Peters, whom Stephen had known in Pittsburgh, and who had taught music in our family ... [Stephen] made a present of "Old Uncle Ned" and "Oh, Susanna" to Mr. Peters. The latter made ten thousand dollars out of them, and established a music publishing house which became the largest in the West. The fame of these two songs went around the world, and thousands sang and played them who never heard the name of the author or whence they came."

Pilliga forest

The State Forests of The Pilliga, also called the Pilliga Scrub, covers an area of 3000 km in north-central New South Wales, Australia. It is the largest area of semi-arid woodland in the state. The forest is near the towns of Baradine and Narrabri and the villages of Pilliga and Gwabegar.
Author Eric Rolls wrote a book about the Pilliga called "A Million Wild Acres." He argued that the forest used to be an open woodland forest and that European influence has let the cypress pines take over. However, many scientific authors now disagree, using historical records from as early as the 1870s which say that the types of plants in the forest have not changed as much as Rolls suggests. However most of his history of the region is an important document for understanding the area.
The geology of the area is mainly Pilliga sandstone. This is a coarse red to yellow Jurassic sandstone containing about 75% quartz, 15% plagioclase and 10% iron oxide.In the south are sandstone outcrops with basalt-capped ridges. In the north there are plains of alluvium from flooding creeks. There are small, shallow, usually dry lakes, called gilgais, in some areas. In the west there are dry sandy creeks, called "sand monkeys". In the east is a heavily eroded sandstone mountain range, which can be seen as sandstone outcrops such as those around Gin's Leap between Baan Baa and Boggabri.
The forest contains at least 900 plant species. Some areas of the forest, particularly in the western Pilliga, are dominated by cypress-pine ("Callitris" spp.). However there are a variety of other plant communities in the forest, some of which do not include "Callitris". These include smaller she-oaks, while eucalypts are the taller trees throughout the forest.
Animals found in the Pilliga Nature Reserve include at least 36 native and nine introduced mammals, 50 reptiles and at least 15 frogs. Squirrel Gliders, Koalas, Rufous Bettongs and Pilliga Mice are present.
A 4909 km area of land, including the forest and the nearby Warrumbungle National Park, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). It supports groups of Painted Honeyeaters and Diamond Firetails. Endangered Swift Parrots and Regent Honeyeaters, and near threatened Bush Stone-curlews, are sometimes seen in the forest. Other woodland birds present in good numbers include Barking Owls, Glossy Black-Cockatoos, Grey-crowned Babblers, Speckled Warblers, Brown Treecreepers, Hooded Robins and Turquoise Parrots.
Fire plays a major role in the ecology of the forest with many plant species needing fire to regenerate. Sometimes the fires can be extremely hot, spread very quickly and threaten nearby properties as well as laying waste to entire ecosystems. If these fires occur less than 15 years apart there can be a loss of plant and animal biodiversity. The size of the Pilliga bushfires is linked to the El Nino Southern Oscillation phenomena, with El Nino (dry) years having the most severe fires.
In 1997 a major fire burned about 1,435 km² of the forest. An extremely dry winter and spring in 2006 saw a number of large fires develop, including the Pilliga 4 Fire in November/December which burned out 740 km² on its first day.
There many roads in the forest, many of which are former forestry roads. There used to be a large forestry industry, cutting cypress pine and ironbarks. In 2005 the NSW government protected much of the forest for environmental conservation.
There are many attractions in the forest, including:

Beautiful Dreamer

"Beautiful Dreamer" is a song by Stephen Foster written about 1862. It was first published (posthumously) in 1864 by William A. Pond & Co. It has been promoted as Foster's last song, but that distinction cannot be confirmed. It is similar in some respects to his first published song, "Open They Lattice, Love". Both have a triple rhythm and share imagery of the sea and marine life. 
The arpeggiated accompaniment recalls bel canto opera. The dreamer in this song is either asleep or dead. The song does not distinguish. It is a song though about dissolution of melting, of dissolving, of vanishing into mists, and, finally into death. The song is not held in the highest esteem by some musicologists and has been described by one as "saccharine" and "[smacking] somewhat of the idiom of Irving Berlin."
<poem>
1.
Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me,
Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee;
Sounds of the rude world, heard in the day,
Lull'd by the moonlight have all pass'd away!
Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song,
List while I woo thee with soft melody;
Gone are the cares of life's busy throng,
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
2.
Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea,
Mermaids are chanting the wild lorelei;
Over the streamlet vapors are borne,
Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn.
Beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart,
E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea;
Then will all clouds of sorrow depart,
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!

Box-Ironbark forest

Box-Ironbark forest is a forest or woodland ecosystem found in central Victoria in south-eastern Australia. It is named after the Box and Ironbark trees which grow in the forest. These tree species produce a lot of nectar and pollen throughout the year. This is important for the conservation of many species of birds and other animals.
Box-Ironbark forest lies mainly within the Goldfields region of Victoria. During the main years of the gold rush (1851-1870) it underwent intensive digging and clearing in the goldfields. Large areas of forest were cut down for use in the gold mines and for firewood in surrounding areas. After the gold rush, the forests were still heavily cut for firewood and cleared for farming.
Box-Ironbark forest is found on rocky, often auriferous (gold-bearing), soils, in flat and undulating landscapes at altitudes of 150–600 m above sea level. The average annual rainfall of is 500–800 mm. About 40% of the original forest ecosystem in Victoria is public land, with about 20% protected in conservation reserves. About 55% has been permanently cleared for agriculture, mining and urban development. Remaining forest is in small scattered areas.
Box-Ironbark forest has a canopy of box, ironbark and gum-barked eucalypts, growing to 25 m in height. Below them is an understorey of wattles, small-leaved and prostrate shrubs, herbs and grasses. The main trees are White Box, Red Box, Red Ironbark, Mugga Ironbark, Yellow Gum and Red Stringybark. In some areas they may grow with, or be replaced by, Yellow Box, Long-leaf Box or Silver Bundy. The mix of plants in the groundcover includes the largest concentrations of orchids of any Victorian ecosystem. Small herbs and shrubs found in Box-Ironbark forests include "Cheiranthera cyanaea", "Philotheca verrucosa", "Xerochrysum viscosum", "Pultenaea largiflorens", "Acacia williamsonii" and "Stuartina muelleri".
The trees of the Box-Ironbark forest produce a lot of flowers and nectar. They are a major source of nectar and pollen for honeyeaters, lorikeets and many kinds of invertebrates. Flowering of the different species of eucalypts takes place at different times of year so there is always a nectar or pollen source available for migratory, nomadic and resident birds. This means there are both more species, and greater numbers of individuals, of honeyeaters and lorikeets than in any other ecosystem. These birds include Black-chinned, Regent, Fuscous and Brown-headed Honeyeaters, Swift Parrots and Musk Lorikeets. The forest supports the largest numbers of Eastern Grey Kangaroos in Victoria and is a stronghold for Brush-tailed Phascogales, Yellow-footed Antechinuses and Squirrel Gliders.

Ironbark

Ironbark is a common name of a number of species within the genus "Eucalyptus" that have dark, deeply furrowed bark.
Many eucalpyts shed their bark very year, but on an Ironbark the dead bark stays on the trees, forming the furrows. It becomes rough after drying out and becomes full of kino, a dark red tree sap exuded by the tree. The bark is resistant to fire and heat and protects the living tissue within the trunk and branches from fire. In cases of extreme fire, where leaves and shoots are removed, the bark protects the epicormic buds which allow the tree to reshoot.

Belanglo State Forest

Belanglo State Forest is a planted forest in the Australian state of New South Wales covering an area of about 3,500 hectares. It is south of Berrima in the Southern Highlands, five kilometres west of the Hume Highway between Sydney and Canberra. The forest is owned by the New South Wales Government and has some of the earliest pine plantings in the state. The public has free access to the forest; it is popular with recreational trail bike riders.
In 1992 and 1993, seven skeletons were found in the forest. These became known as "The Backpacker Murders" and was thought to be the work of a serial killer. Eventually, Ivan Milat was convicted of the murders in 1996 and sentenced to life imprisonment.
On the 29 August 2010 trail bike riders discovered another human skeleton in the forest. At first this was thought to be another victim of Ivan Milat, but later forensic evidence suggests that the remains were left there at a later date.
On 22 November 2010, three teenagers (including one related to Ivan Milat) were arrested over the murder of David Auchterlonie, in the Belanglo State Forest. He had been murdered by friends on his birthday, and left in a shallow grave. 
One of the teenagers reported the murder to the police.

Wombat State Forest

The Wombat State Forest, also called the Bullarook Forest, is west of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, between Woodend and Daylesford, at the Great Dividing Range. The forest covers an area of about . The Bullarook Wombat State Forest was set up in 1871. 
The forest is managed by the Department of Sustainability and Environment. The management plan covers firewood and other products; protection of water supplies, conservation of biodiversity, and conservation of landscape. Other areas of importance include cultural heritage, research, education, tourism, recreation, mineral exploration, mining, and grazing.
The Dja Dja Wurrung peoples lived the area that is now state forest land. Before European settlement, the forest covered a larger area than it does today.
The forest was logged heavily during the gold rush era of the mid-1800s. The wood was used for tunnel supports, sleepers for tramways, lining of mining shafts, firewood for mine boilers, piles for piers and docks, electric poles, and heavy construction timbers. In 1860 the 1860 Land Act (Section 80) was created, which placed some restrictions on logging trees. In 1871, the Wombat State Forest was set up. 
By 1884, there were 36 saw mills in the Wombat and Bullarook Forests. The wood was sent to Melbourne, Sandhurst, and Ballarat. There was little replanting and the young trees were burned. Eventually the forest was ruined, and timber harvesting was stopped. 
After the gold rush, the forest slowly began to regrow. By the 1960s selected logging was begun to try to improve the quality of the forest. In the 1970s and 80s, the area was called the "Midlands Forest Management Area". This included the planting of pine trees for commercial logging.
In 2001, the local community published its own findings about the forest's sustainable management. This was one of the first examples of community involvement in a state-run management plan. In 2010, community worried that logging could begin in the forest because the State Government gave out logging licenses in western Victoria.
The Wombat Forest is divided by the Great Dividing Range. The forest grows along both sides of the Dividing Range, from Creswick to Mount Macedon. There are about 400 extinct volcanoes in a stretch that extends from Kilmore in the north to Mt Gambier in South Australia. Some of these volcanoes, including Mount Babbington, Mount Wilson and Blue Mount are in the Wombat Forest.
The geology make up is of Ordovician or Tertiary sediments. The rock types are of volcanic origin, dated to the Palaeozoic era. Quaternary basalts, all of volcanic origin, were in the west of the Wombat State Forest. These lands have been cleared for farming. However, Ordovician or sedimentary soils, with poor soil conditions for farming, have remained undisturbed. Since the Pliocene the forest has changed from ash rainforest to a dry sclerophyll forest.
The Wombat State Forest is the headwaters of the Lerderderg, Campaspe and Loddon rivers. An interesting part of the forest is a large number of mineral springs. These are about 80% of Australia’s mineral springs. The mineral waters are rich in calcium, silica, magnesium, iron and sulphur. The volcanic activity of the region has added carbon dioxide to the water that is seen in the form of bubbles emerging from the springs.
The native fauna are marsupials, monotremes, reptiles, amphibians, bats and birds. The Greater Glider ("Petauroides volans") is the largest possum found in this forest. It lives in the western part of the Wombat State Forest. Several threatened bird species live in the forest including the Great Egret, Intermediate Egret, Grey Goshawk, Australian Masked Owl, Powerful Owl and Square-tailed Kite. The forest is also home to the Red-browed Treecreeper and Olive Whistler.
The native plants are small medium and tall trees; shrubs of varying sizes; climbers; native herbs/forbs, grasses; rushes, sedges and aquatics; lilies, ferns and orchids. The open forest is dominated by a number of eucalypt species including Messmate ("Eucalyptus obliqua"), Broad-leaf Peppermint ("E. dives"), Narrow-leaf Peppermint ("E. radiata"), Manna Gum ("E. viminalis") and Candlebark ("E. rubida"). Swamp Gum ("Eucalyptus ovata") and Yarra Gum ("E. yarraensis") can also be found in the forest. 
"Armillaria luteobubalina", a fungus that causes forest dieback, has been found. The forest has 111 fungal species spread over its wide and varying habitats. These include “native and introduced species as well as a selection of lichenised fungi and myxomycetes (slime moulds).”
Rare or threatened plant species include Wiry Bossiaea "(Bossiaea cordigera)", Matted Flax-lily ("Dianella amoena"), Brooker’s Gum ("Eucalyptus brookeriana"), Fryerstown Grevillea ("Grevillea obtecta"), Creeping Grevillea ("G. repens"), Hairy Beard-heath ("Leucopogon microphyllus" var. "pilibundus"), Satinwood ("Nematolepis squamea" subsp. "squamea"), Small Sickle Greenhood ("Pterostylis lustra"), Scented Bush-pea ("Pultenaea graveolens") as well as two endemic species Wombat Leafless Bossiaea ("Bossiaea vombata") and Wombat Bush-pea ("Pultenaea reflexifolia").
Lyonville Mineral Springs, Garden of St Erth, the Lerderderg Heritage River Walk, and Nolans Creek Picnic Area are some of the tourist attractions in the forest. Other historic places include the Andersons Mill, Balt Camp, Pioneer Sawmill, and Yankee Mine. There is also a heritage diesel railway in the forest.

2012 is a 2009 American science fiction disaster movie directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich. It was produced by Centropolis Entertainment, Emmerich's production company, and distributed by Columbia Pictures. It is based upon the 2012 phenomenon, which was a number of beliefs that destructive events would occur on or around December 21, 2012. It was released on November 13, 2009. Critics gave it mixed reviews. They liked its special effects, but were critical of its length (158 minutes) and screenwriting. It made $770 million worldwide.
Neutrinos from a very large solar flare from the sun cause the temperature of Earth to increase at a very fast rate, eventually causing a very large geological and meterological disaster. The plot follows Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) as he tries to bring his children, Noah (Liam James) and Lilly (Morgan Lily), ex-wife Kate Curtis (Amanda Peet), and her boyfriend, Gordon Silberman (Thomas McCarthy) to safety from the destructive events that occur. Among these events, a very large earthquake causes California to fall into the Pacific Ocean, the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts, and a very large tsunami hits the United States.

The Indigenous Australians, the Beeripmo balug people, called it "Bereep-bereep", which means "wild". The forest covers an area of 12,150 hectares, including the forest around Mount Lonarch.
The forest is on a plateau which is above grassy plains. The plateau is about 760 metres above sea level. High peaks in the forest include Mount Buangor (1,090 metres), Mount Cole (899 metres) and Ben Nevis (877 metres).
The main trees in the southern part of the forest are Messmate (Eucalyptus oblique), Manna Gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), and Blue Gums (Eucalyptus st johnii). In the north, which is drier, there are Yellow Box (Eucalyptus melliodora), and Red Stringybark (Eucalyptus macrorryncha). There is also the rare Mount Cole Grevillea, Grevillea montis-cole. On the high peaks there are groups of Snow Gums (Eucalyptus pauciflora).
There have been 130 different birds seen in the forest. Animals include kangaroos, wallabies, echidna, koalas and possums. In 1954, 160 koalas were set free in the forest to as part of a plan to re-establish the animals in Victorian forests. In the 19th century, deer were introduced and Sambar deer are still living in the wet gullies in the south of the forest. In 1926 the forest was made a sanctuary, and all hunting was banned.
Activities in the forest include camping, walking, four wheel driving, horse riding, and bird watching.
The purpose of the forest is to supply good quality hardwood logs for sawmills. The management plan for the forest also protects the water catchments of several creeks which supply water to nearby towns. 
An area of 1,940 hectares, the Mount Buangor State Park, was protected from logging in 1973. This park includes the waterfalls on Middle Creek, and the large rock faces and caves on Cave Hill.

Royal forest

A royal forest is an area of land with various meanings, but basically it is woodland once owned by monarchs. 
In Anglo-Saxon England, the kings were great huntsmen but they never set aside areas forbidden to other users. Historians find no evidence of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs (c.500 to 1066) creating forests. 
However, under the Norman kings (after 1066), no hunting was allowed on Royal lands except by authority of the King. The law was designed to protect the "venison" and the "vert", the "noble" animals of the chase – notably red and fallow deer, the roe, and the wild boar – and the greenery which sustained them. 
Royal forests were designed as hunting areas reserved for the monarch or (by invitation) the aristocracy. The concept was introduced by the Normans to England in the 11th century, and in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, one-third of the land area of southern England was designated as royal forest. At one stage in the 12th century, all of Essex was afforested, and on his accession Henry II declared all of Huntingdonshire to be royal forest.
Afforestation, in particular the creation of the New Forest, figured large in the folk history of the "Norman Yoke": 
Forest law prescribed harsh punishment for anyone who committed any offence within the forests. Killing game was a capital offence. By the mid-17th century, enforcement of this law died out, but many English woodlands still bear the title "Royal Forest". The practice of reserving areas of land for the sole use of the aristocracy was common throughout Europe during the mediaeval period. 
Royal forests usually included large areas of heath, grassland and wetland – anywhere that supported deer and other game. In addition, when an area was designated forest, any villages, towns and fields that lay within it were also subject to forest law. Local inhabitants were restricted in the use of land they had previously relied on for their livelihood. However, common rights were not extinguished, but merely restricted.

New Forest

The New Forest is an area of southern England. It includes one of the largest remaining tracts of open pasture land, heathland and forest in the heavily-populated south east of England. It covers south-west Hampshire and extends into south-east Wiltshire and towards east Dorset.
The name also refers to the New Forest National Park which has similar boundaries. The New Forest local government district is a subdivision of Hampshire which covers most of the Forest. There are many villages dotted around the area, and several small towns in the Forest and around its edges.
The New Forest was created as a royal forest by William I in about 1079 for the royal hunt, mainly of deer. It was created at the expense of more than 20 small hamlets and isolated farmsteads; hence it was 'new' in his time as a single compact area.
It was first recorded as "Nova Foresta" in Domesday Book in 1086. It is the only forest that the book describes in detail. "Probably no action of the early Norman kings is more notorious than their creation of the New Forest".
Two of William's sons died in the Forest: Prince Richard in 1081 and King William II (William Rufus) in 1100. Local folklore asserted that this was punishment for the crimes committed by William when he created his New Forest; a 17th-century writer provides detail:
"William the Conqueror (for the making of the said Forest a harbour for Wild-beasts for his Game) caused 36 Parish Churches, with all the Houses thereto belonging, to be pulled down, and the poor Inhabitants left succourless of house or home. But this wicked act did not long go unpunished, for his Sons felt the smart thereof; Richard being blasted with a pestilent Air; Rufus shot through with an Arrow; and Henry his Grand-child, by Robert his eldest son, as he pursued his Game, was hanged among the boughs, and so dyed. This Forest at present affordeth great variety of Game, where his Majesty oft-times withdraws himself for his divertisement." 
The common rights were confirmed by statute in 1698. The New Forest became a source of timber for the Royal Navy, and plantations were created in the 18th century for this purpose. In the Great Storm of 1703, about 4000 oak trees were lost. The naval plantations affected the rights of the Commoners, but the Forest gained new protection under an Act of Parliament in 1877. 
The New Forest Act 1877 confirmed the historic rights of the Commoners and prohibited the enclosure of more than at any time. It also reconstituted the Court of Verderers as representatives of the Commoners (rather than the Crown). Felling of broadleaved trees, and their replacement by conifers, began during the First World War to meet the wartime demand for wood. Further encroachments were made during the Second World War. This process is being reversed in places, with some plantations being returned to heathland or broadleaved woodland. Rhododendron remains a problem.
As of 2005, roughly 90% of the New Forest is still owned by the Crown. The Crown lands have been managed by the Forestry Commission since 1923 and most of the Crown lands now fall inside the new National Park.
Further New Forest Acts followed in 1949, 1964 and 1970. The New Forest became an SSSI in 1971, and was made the "New Forest Heritage Area" in 1985, with more planning controls added in 1992. The New Forest was proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in June 1999, and it became a National Park in 2005.
The purpose of forest laws was to preserve the New Forest as a place for royal deer hunting, and interference with the King's deer and its forage was punished. The inhabitants of the area ("commoners") had pre-existing "rights of common". 
The rights were to turn horses and cattle (but only rarely sheep) out into the Forest to graze ("common pasture"), to gather fuel wood, to cut peat for fuel, to dig clay ("marl"), and to turn out pigs between September and November to eat fallen acorns and beechnuts ("pannage" or "mast"). 
Grazing and pannage are still important to the Forest's ecology. Pigs can eat acorns without a problem, whereas to ponies and cattle large numbers of acorns can be poisonous. Pannage always lasts 60 days but the start date varies according to the weather – and when the acorns fall. The Verderers decide when pannage will start each year. At other times the pigs must be taken in and kept on the owner's land, with the exception that pregnant sows, known as "privileged sows", are always allowed out, providing they are not a nuisance and return to the Commoner's holding at night. Commoners must have backup land outside the Forest to hold these depastured animals if necessary. 
Commons rights used to be attached to particular plots of land (or to particular hearths). Grazing of commoners' ponies and cattle is an essential part of the management of the Forest, helping to keep the heathland, bog, grassland and wood-pasture habitats and their wildlife in good shape.This ancient practice came under pressure as the rising house prices in the area stopped local commoning families from moving into new homes which have the rights attached which meant the next generation could not become commoners until their parents passed on the house and rights. Those rights are now dissasociated. Efforts by the CDA, Verderers and associated bodies mean there is a burgeoning economy in the New Forest and a chance for some commoners to earn well above the minimum wage - and additional help for their farming interests. This will help the commoners continue to preserve the Forest.

Charnwood Forest is an area in north-western Leicestershire, England, near Leicester, Loughborough, and Coalville. 
Although called a forest, it is extremely varied, with many different areas. It has 45 sites of geological or wildlife interest. Above all, it is the only site in Europe where the Ediacaran fossil "Charnia" is found.
The area has some extensive tracts of woodland. It is undulating, rocky and picturesque, with barren areas. It is generally 600 ft (180 m) and upwards. On its western side is an abandoned coalfield, with Coalville and other former mining villages. This is now being regenerated and replanted as part of the National Forest. The M1 motorway cuts through Charnwood Forest. 
The hard stone of Charnwood Forest has been quarried for centuries, and was a source of grind-stones. The granite quarries are of national importance and supply crushed stone ("aggregate") to much of southern Britain.
Charnwood Forest includes a National Nature Reserve (NNR), 19 SSSIs, four geological conservation sites of international importance, and another six conservation sites, 13 Regionally Important Geological Sites (RIGS), five local nature reserves (LNRs), and seven Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust (LRWT) nature reserves.
The Forest is an important recreational area with woodland walks, noted for their displays of bluebells in the early spring. Rockclimbing and walking are popular.

It was made by the eruption of "Monte Armarelo", which was replaced by the smaller Pico do Fogo.
The Chã das Caldeiras is in southwestern Cape Verde and occupies the north-east of the island of Fogo. It is shared between the municipalities of Mosteiros to the north and Santa Catarina do Fogo to the south.
A little more of a thousand people live permanently inside the caldera, in the small towns of "Bangaeira" and "Portela"; these towns are at about , where sometimes the temperature gets to . Part of the National Park of Fogo, it is one of the main tourist destinations of Cape Verde. It is accessed by a single central road long from São Filipe.
The vegetation is sparse but several endemic plants nevertheless grow there, especially "Echium vulcanorum" (') and "Erysimum caboverdeanum" (') that can not be found anywhere else. Others are "Sarcostemma daltonii" ('), "Verbascum cystolithicum" ('), "Lavandula rotundifolia" (') ou "Euphorbia tuckeyana" (').
Where land is not covered by lava, farmers grow fruit trees, grains and vineyards. A cooperative produces a local wine, the "manecon", which is not send to other countries.

Oil sands

Oil sands, or tar sands are an unconventional source of petroleum. The oil sands are a mixture of sand, clay and water together with a dense and extremely sticky form of petroleum referred to as bitumen.
Natural bitumen is found in many countries, with the largest quantities in Canada, Kazakhstan and Russia. The estimated worldwide deposits are more than 2 trillion barrels (320 billion cubic metres). These estimates include deposits that have not yet been discovered. Around 70% of all proven reserves are in Canada.
Oil produced from bitumen sands is often referred to as unconventional oil, to separate it from traditional liquid oil. The production process is very energy consuming so that the net energy gain is much smaller compared to traditional oil. Making liquid fuels from oil sands requires much energy and produces 12 percent more greenhouse gases per barrel of final product than production of traditional oil. Therefore oil sands have only recently been considered to be part of the world's oil reserves. Higher oil prices now allow for profitable extraction and processing.
Getting the oil sands off the ground often destroys large areas of land. Much water is used to separate the oil from the sand and then left polluted. Carbon dioxide and other emissions from the extraction process are polluting the air.
The environmental destruction caused by oil sand extraction is criticized by environmental groups such as Greenpeace, The Climate Reality Project, 350.org, MoveOn.org, the Sierra Club and the Energy Action Coalition.
In 2012 the European Union (EU) said that it may declare oil sands oil as "highly polluting". This caused stress between the EU and Canada.

350.org is an international environmental organization. It was started by author Bill McKibben, with the goal of building a global grassroots movement to fight against global warming and the denial of climate change. However the main goal is to lower the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in order to avoid climate change problems.
The name 350.org comes the research of NASA scientist Dr. James Hansen. He wrote in a scientific paper in 2007 that the level of carbon dioxide (CO) in the atmosphere should not be higher than 350 parts-per-million (ppm). According to scientific research this is a safe maximum to avoid a climate tipping point.
350.org works with over 300 other organizations around the world. It has had people supporting the organization as "messengers". Among them are Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Alex Steffen, Bianca Jagger and David Suzuki. Van Jones and Gus Speth are on 350's U.S. Advisory Council. 350.org has a Board of Directors.
350.org is strongly against the Keystone XL pipeline project. The pipeline is currently being built to transport tar sand oil from Canada through the United States to oil refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. NASA climatologist James Hansen described the Keystone XL pipeline as "game over" for the planet, and called the amount of carbon stored in Canadian tar sands a "fuse to the largest carbon bomb on the planet". 
350.org wants colleges and universities, as well as cities, religious institutions, and pension funds to withdraw their investments from fossil fuel companies. They propose the money should rather be invested in sustainable companies.
The "Do The Math" movie is a 42-minute documentary about the movement, the science behind the climate crisis and how to end the age of fossil fuels.
The organization's efforts continued into 2012 with a Climate Impacts Day on May 5th of worldwide series of rallies under the slogan "Connect the Dots," to draw attention to the links between climate change and extreme weather.
350 helped helped organize the People's Climate March, which took place on September 21, 2014.

Fulk V (1092–1143), called "le Jeune" (the younger), was a French nobleman who was the Count of Anjou from 1109 to 1129. He was the Count of Maine ("jure uxoris") 1110–1129. Fulk was a crusader, Knight Templar and was the King of Jerusalem ("jure uxoris") from 1131 to his death.
Fulk le Jeune, born in 1092, was the younger son of Fulk IV le Réchin and his fifth wife Bertrade de Montfort. She was the daughter of Simon de Montfort, Count de Montfort l'Amaury. As an infant he was probably taken with his mother to be raised at the French court. He was at the French court in 1106 when the news arrived of his , Geoffrey IV, Count of Anjou's death. King Philip I then made his step-son, Fulk V, the Count of Anjou. The French king then made Duke William of Aquitaine Fulk's guardian as Fulk was not yet old enough to rule on his own. Instead the duke put Fulk in prison. Nothing the king or queen threatened could get Duke William to release the boy. After a year his father, Fulk le Réchin finally paid the duke a ransom of several towns on the border with Poitou. Fulk le Réchin died two years later on April 14, 1109. Fulk V "je June" succeeded his father as the count of Anjou.
In 1110 Fulk V le Jeune married Eremburge of Maine. When her father, Count Elias, died a few months later, Fulk V became the Count of Maine in right of his wife. But this brought him into immediate conflict with King Henry I of England who also claimed Maine. For a time Fulk was the first Angevin count to directly rule Maine. In 1113 Henry I arranged to meet with Fulk V at Alençon. There they arranged a peace agreement. To seal the agreement they made a marriage alliance. Fulk's infant daughter Matilda was promised in marriage to Henry's nine year old son, William Adelin. Fulk V remained the count of Maine but he swore fealty to King Henry I as his overlord. Without his Angevin ally Fulk, King Louis VI of France was forced to make peace with King Henry I. King Louis confirmed the lordship (overlordship) of Maine to Henry I. Henry then attacked the lands of Robert de Bellême; joined by Fulk V. Bellême was defeated and Henry I returned to England. Fulk V returned to Anjou to deal with a revolt in Angers.
In 1116 Louis IV raided into Normandy again. Louis had supported Henry I's nephew, William Clito as the Duke of Normandy. By 1117 King Louis IV of France, Count Baldwin VII of Flanders and Fulk V of Anjou were all supporting William Clito against Henry I of England. The next summer Henry I returned to Normandy and the war began. Fulk V defeated Henry I at La Motte-Gautier on the border of Maine. In October of 1118 Fulk V again defeated Henry I at Alençon. Finally, after a series of defeats Henry I made peace with Fulk V. They sealed their truce by allowing the marriage of Fulk's daughter Matilda with Henry's son William William Adelin. Fulk V gave Maine as a dowry for his daughter Matilda. In 1120 Fulk V then made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He spent a year at Jerusalem. According to Orderic Vitalis he joined the Knights Templar. When he returned to Anjou Fulk left 100 knights behind for a year to help defend the Kingdom. He continued to pay the Templars a substantial yearly donation for the rest of his life.
Fulk le Jeune returned to Anjou in early 1121. He learned that William Adelin, his new son-in-law William had drowned in the shipwreck of the White Ship. The treaty with Anjou then died with Henry's son. Fulk's daughter Matilda was safe; she had not been on the White ship. Fulk demanded her return to Anjou. But Henry delayed her return and kept part of her dowry. By 1122 she was back in Anjou. Fulk broke off all relations with Henry and made another marriage alliance with Henry's nephew and enemy, William Clito. William was to marry Fulk's daughter Sibyl. He again gave his new son-in-law the lordship of Maine as her dowry. As Henry dealt with his rebel Norman barons one by one, by 1124 Fulk V was William Clito's only supporter. Henry now did everything he could to get the pope to annul the marriage between William Clito and Sibyl. On 26 August 1124 Pope Calixtus II annulled the marriage of William Clito and Sibyl because they were too closely related.
In 1126 Fulk le Jeune's wife, Eremburge, Countess of Maine and Anjou died. In Germany,Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor died. His wife the Empress Matilda was Henry I of England's only living legitimate child. Henry called her back to England. Henry made all his English and Norman barons swear that in case Henry had no sons they would make Matilda the Queen of England succeeding him. In 1127 Henry made peace again with Fulk le Jeune and offered a new marriage alliance. Fulk's son, Geoffrey was to wed the Empress Matilda and Maine would be settled on the new couple. In June of 1128, Henry I came to Rouen and there knighted Geoffrey of Anjou. A week later the couple was married.
About this same time Fulk le Jeune had received representatives of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. king Baldwin II had no sons but he had four daughters. He offered the hand of his oldest daughter, Melisende, to Fulk le June along with the crown of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. Fulk was well known in Jerusalem from his earlier visit and the money he sent the Knights Templar every year. In Jerusalem Melisende became officially the heiress of the kingdom. She would rule as Queen at her father's death. After the wedding of his son Geoffrey, Fulk le Jeune and his children all met at the Fontevraud Abbey where his daughter Matilda became a nun. They said their farewells and Fulk le Jeune set off for Jerusalem. Geoffrey V, nicknamed "la Bel" was to rule Anjou in his father's absence.
In the spring of 1129 Fulk le Jeune arrived in Jerusalem. He and Melisende were married. As a part of their marriage contract at the death of her father, King Baldwin II, Fulk and Melisende were to rule Jerusalem together. As a dowry Fulk and Melisende received the two most valuable ports in the kingdom, Tyre and Acre. Fulk brought a large number of knights and foot soldiers with him from Anjou.
In 1131, on the death of Baldwin II of Jerusalem, Fulk was crowned king. Melisende was crowned Queen at the same time. But from the beginning of their rule Fulk attempted to ruled alone. He tried to keep Melisende from having an active part in ruling Jerusalem. Fulk began replacing governors and with his own followers from Anjou. Many had served several of the Kings of Jerusalem. Their loss of favor with the new king caused a great deal of resentment. Between 1133 and 1134 a revolt started among the nobility of Jerusalem led by count Count Hugh II of Jaffa. Fulk called on Count Hugh to appear before him but Hugh refused. Fulk then took away Hugh's of Jaffa. Hugh was angry and joined with their enemies the Egyptians. But his followers left Hugh and came back to King Fulk. Hugh next submitted to King Fulk and was exiled for three years. The revolt was broken. During the revolt however, the Seljuks of Damascus were able to take back Banyas. But Fulk realized he could not exclude Melisende and from then on allowed her to share in ruling the kingdom.
In 1132 Pons, Count of Tripoli was defeated by Seljuks and was under siege at the castle of Montferrand (Baarin). Fulk rushed to his aid and forced the enemy to retreat. In 1134 Fulk raided into Hauran (in present day Syria and Jordan). But he was forced to retreat when Seljuks countered by attacking Jerusalem. In September the two sides agreed to a peace.
In 1136 Fulk began building castles around the fortress city of Ascalon. This was to prevent raids on Jerusalem by the Egyptian Fatimids. He also built a castle at Beth Gibelin and placed it in the care of the Knights Hospitaller. Also in 1136 the Grand Master (leader) of the Knights Templar, Hugues de Payens, died. Fulk used his influence with the Templars to get one of his own Angevins, Robert of Craon, elected Grand Master. In 1137 Fulk was besieged at Montferrand. The Patriarch of Jerusalem marched an army to relieve the fortress. But Fulk did not know his own army was coming to his rescue. The Seljuks knew of this and quickly offered Fulk favorable terms. King Fulk surrendered the castle in exchange for his own freedom.
In 1137 while the Christians and Muslims were engaged with each other a new force was entering the area. John, the Byzantine Emperor was moving against Antioch. He decided to take back the city and began attacking the walls. Too powerful for Fulk to deal with he decided to surrender Antioch to the Emperor. The Prince of Antioch, Raymond of Poitiers, had to surrender to the Emperor in person. Then, with the Byzantine flag above the city and Raymond still the Prince, the Emperor returned to Constantinople. Fulk, the King of Jerusalem, lost his control over Antioch.
On 10 November 1143 Fulk died in a hunting accident falling from his horse. After Fulk's death Melisende took control of Jerusalem. She ruled as queen and as for their oldest son Baldwin III.
In 1110, Fulk married Ermengarde of Maine († 1126), the daughter of Elias I of Maine. Together they had:
His second wife was Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem, the daughter of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem and Morphia of Melitene. Together they had:

Pacific Rim is a 2013 American science fiction monster movie. It was directed by Guillermo del Toro, and written by Toro and Travis Beacham. It was produced by Legendary Pictures and distributed by Warner Bros.. It was released on July 12, 2013. Critics gave it good reviews. They liked its special effects and action scenes. It made more than $384 million worldwide.
In 2013, the Earth's cities are attacked by Kaiju, very large monsters who come from a portal on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. To battle them, the nations in the Pacific Rim build the Jaegars: very large robots piloted by two people whose brains are linked to the robots. This allows the pilots to control the robots using their mind, and the robots do the same actions that the pilots do. Although the Jaegars work well in killing the Kaiju, the attacks happen more often and are more powerful. By 2025, the governments of the Pacific Rim have ended the Jaegar project and build very large walls to protect humans from the Kaiju. Most of the film is set in this period, focusing on the war's later days.

Hepburn Regional Park

The Hepburn Regional Park is a large bush and forest park which surrounds the towns of Daylesford and Hepburn Springs, in the Central Highlands area of Victoria, Australia. The Hepburn Regional Park was set up in 1977. It covers an area of 1,800 hectares. The park features a large number of minerals springs. In the Victorian gold rush of the 1850s' and 1860's there was a lot of gold mining in the area. There are many of these old gold mining sites within the forest. At the Blowhole on Sailors Creek, the miners dug a large tunnel to change the path of the creek so that they could search for gold. The Mount Franklin Reserve is also a part of the Hepburn Regional Park. This reserve protects the scoria cone of Mount Franklin, an extinct volcano. 
Most of the forest is fairly dry, with the main trees being box, peppermint and stringybark. In the south of the forest the climate is wetter, and manna gums, messmates and candlebark trees are common. In spring there are many wildflowers, including the Victorian floral emblem, Common or Pink Heath.
Animals in the forest include kangaroos, koalas and the rare Brush-tailed Phascogale.

Creswick Regional Park

The Creswick Regional Park, also known as the Creswick State Forest, is a large forest near the town of Creswick. It covers an area of 930 hectares. Much of the forest was heavily logged to supply timber to the gold mines in Ballarat and Creswick during the 1850s and 1860s. Many gold mining sites can be found in the forest.
St.Georges Lake is a man-made lake built to supply water for hydraulic sluicing. Eaton's Dam is another gold water supply. In 1942, students from the Creswick Forestry School fenced a small area of forest to create a breeding area for koalas. However the koalas were able to climb the fence, and the Koala Park was not successful.
A section of the Great Dividing Trail, the Wallaby Track, passes through the Creswick Regional Park. Some of it follows the water races built by the gold miners to supply water for their activities.

Canonical form

In mathematics and computer science the term Canonical form, or sometimes Normal form refers to the usual representation of a mathematical object. For example, the canonical form of a positive integer in decimal representation is a finite sequence of digits that does not begin with zero.
Mathematics has defined equivalence relations for some objects. These equivalence relations say that certain classes of objects are "equal". These objects then belong to the same equivalence class. In such a case, a canonical form consists in the choice of a specific object in each class. For example, row echelon form and Jordan normal form are canonical forms for matrices.

The Enfield State Park, also known as the Enfield State Forest, is a large forest reserve south of Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. It covers an area of about 4,600 hectares. The Enfield State Park was once the site for gold mining, and there are many gold mining relics in the area. There was a Chinese settlement at Surface Point during the gold rush. There were temples, tearooms, gaming tents, herbalists and market gardens. People are still able to go searching for gold in the park. 
Timber from the forest was used for mining and building. There was a eucalyptus distillery at the town of Enfield, making eucalyptus oil.
There are also picnic areas and walking trails through the park.
The forest is an open dry forest, with messmates, peppermints, swamp gums, manna gums and the rare Yarra Gum. Over 100 bird species, and 22 native mammal species have been seen in the park.

Eucalyptus viminalis

Eucalyptus viminalis, or Manna Gum, is also known as White Gum, Ribbon Gum or Viminalis. It is an Australian eucalypt.
It is a straight tree growing to about 40 metres tall. It has rough bark on the trunk and the larger branches. The bark on the upper part of the tree peels away in long "ribbons" which can collect on the branches and surrounding ground. The tree with the largest recorded diameter (324.7 cm) is at Woodbourne in Marlborough, New Zealand.
"E. viminalis" grows in the cooler areas of Australia where the leaves are the favoured food of Koalas. The sap has a 5–15% sugar content which makes it an essential food for tree dwelling marsupials like the Yellow-bellied Glider, and the Sugar Glider. 
There are three subspecies:
Timber is a pale pink to pinkish brown colour, often with distinctive light grey streaks. The attractive light pink tones of this species and its easy workability mean it is often used to make furniture. It has low strength and durability which makes it unsuitable for structural use, however some is used for house framing. 
It can grow in temperatures as low as −15 degrees Celsius (+5 °F) or more making it suitable for planting in Europe.

Eucalyptus dives or broad-leaved peppermint is a small tree found in the temperate dry sclerophyll woodlands and forests of south-eastern Australia. The leaves have a strong peppermint smell.
The leaves have a high oil content, about 4.7% of the leaf fresh weight. When the oil is distilled it can be used to produce methanol. The major producing region is eastern Transvaal, South Africa, where it is grown in commercial plantations. The leaves have also been used as a flavouring in Australia, especially in brewed black "Camellia sinensis" 'billy tea'.

Caledonian Forest

The Caledonian Forest is a type of woodland that once covered vast areas of Scotland. Today, parts of the original forest survive, covering in 84 places. The forests are home to a wide variety of wildlife, much of which is not found elsewhere in the British Isles.
The Caledonian Forests were formed at the end of the last ice age. Trees began to recolonise what is now the British Isles over a land bridge which is now beneath the English Channel. Forests of this type were found all over what is now the island of Great Britain for a short period. Then the climate began to warm and the pinewoods retreated north into the Scottish Highlands. The Highlands are the last remaining climatic region suitable for them in the British Isles.
The native pinewoods which formed this westernmost outpost of the boreal forest of Europe are estimated to have covered as a vast wilderness of Scots pine, birch, rowan, aspen, juniper, oak and a few other species. On the west coast, oak and birch predominated in a temperate rainforest ecosystem rich in ferns, mosses and lichens.
The forest takes its name from the Romans, who called Scotland "Caledonia", from the early Celtic word '*caleto-' meaning 'hard, strong'. The name was used by a local tribe or tribal confederation of native Picts or Britons called the "Caledonii". 
Today less than 1% of the original native pinewood forest survives, in isolated remnants.
A unique ecosystem in the British Isles, the Caledonian Pinewoods are home to some of the country's rarest wildlife. It is one of the last remaining wildernesses in the British Isles.

Wildlife originally meant non-domesticated animal species. It now includes all plants, fungi and other organisms which grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. Domesticating wild plant and animal species for human benefit has occurred many times all over the planet. It has had a big effect on the environment, both positive and negative.
Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rain forests, plains, grasslands, and other areas including the most developed urban sites, all have distinct forms of wildlife. most scientists agree that wildlife around is affected by human activities.

Cannock Chase

Cannock Chase is a woodland and mixed area of countryside in the county of Staffordshire, England. The area has been designated as the Cannock Chase Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Chase gives its name to the local government district.
Cannock Chase is between Cannock, Lichfield, Rugeley and Stafford. It is a mixture of natural deciduous woodland, coniferous plantations, open heathland and the remains of early industry, such as coal mining.
Cannock Chase was made an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) on 16 September 1958. Much of the area is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Despite its relatively small area, the chase has a remarkable variety of landscape and wildlife.
The wildlife includes a herd of about 800 fallow deer. There are a number of rare and endangered birds, like the migrant Nightjars. A feeding station attracts many species, including Brambling, Yellowhammer and Bullfinch.
Efforts are underway to increase the amount of heathland on the chase, reintroducing shrubs such as heather in some areas where bracken and birch forest have crowded out most other plants. The local flora also includes several species of "Vaccinium", including the Cannock Chase Berry ("Vaccinium ×intermedium" Ruthe).
On the Chase's north-eastern edge can be found Shugborough Hall, ancestral home of the Earls of Lichfield. At its southern edge are the remains of Castle Ring, an Iron Age hill fort, which is the highest point on the Chase. Several glacial erratic boulders are also found on the Chase, remnants of glaciation. One is mounted on a plinth.
Since 2006, the forest has been used as an open-air music venue as part of the Forestry Commission nationwide Forest Tour, with acts such as The Zutons, The Feeling, Status Quo and Jools Holland playing in a forest clearing.
The area gained notoriety in the late 1960s when the Cannock Chase murders made national headlines; the remains of three young girls were found buried on the Chase after going missing from areas along the A34 road between there and Birmingham. Raymond Leslie Morris, a motor engineer from Walsall, was found guilty at Stafford assizes of one of the murders in 1968 and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He is still in prison over 40 years later and one of the country's longest serving prisoners.
The landscape owes much to the underlying Triassic "bunter" formations. These are sandstone deposits containing rounded pebbles. They can be found in Warwickshire, Cheshire, Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire, Devon and Dorset in England. They are thought to be alluvial deposits. Judging from the rounding of the mainly quartzite pebbles, they were carried for a long time in a large and turbulent river. The hard pebbles got powerful abrasion. The deposits in the English Midlands are thought to have been carried northwards from Brittany in northern France.

Heath

A heath or heathland is a shrubland habitat found mainly on low quality, acidic soils. It has open, low growing woody vegetation. 
There are some clear differences between "heath" and "moorland". For example "moorland" has a very peaty topsoil, and it is also free-draining, whereas a heath is not. Moorland is generally related to high-ground heaths with — especially in Great Britain — a cooler and damper climate.
Heathland is common worldwide. They form extensive and diverse communities across Australia in humid and sub-humid areas. Fire regimes with burning maintain the heathlands. Even more diverse though less widespread heath occurs in Southern Africa. Extensive heath communities can also be found in the California chaparral, New Caledonia, central Chile and along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. In addition to these extensive heath areas, the vegetation type is also found in scattered locations across all continents except Antarctica.

Count of Flanders

The Count of Flanders was the ruler or leader of the county of Flanders from the 9th century until the French Revolution in 1790. The first count was Baldwin I "Iron Arm". By expanding its borders the early counts managed to keep Flanders independent. Later, the lack of natural borders allowed into Flanders. Counts of Flanders were always concerned with hunting and preserving their hunting grounds. For that reason many were called foresters. The last count was Francis II. After 1795 Flanders no longer existed as a county.
Charles V proclaimed the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549 eternally uniting Flanders with the other lordships of the Low Countries in a personal union. When the Habsburg empire was divided among the heirs of Charles V, the Low Countries, including Flanders, went to Philip II of Spain, of the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg.
Between 1706 and 1714 Flanders was invaded by the English and the Dutch during the War of the Spanish Succession. The fief was claimed by the House of Habsburg and the House of Bourbon. In 1713, the Treaty of Utrecht settled the succession and the County of Flanders went to the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg.
The title was abolished after revolutionary France annexed Flanders in 1795. Francis II relinquished his claim on the Low Countries in the Treaty of Campo Formio of 1797. The area remained part of France until the end of the Napoleonic Wars.

"Yvain, the Knight of the Lion" is a well known and documented story of a Sir Yvain in King Arthur's court. Before being known as the Knight of the Lion, Sir Yvain went on a mission to revenge the brother-in-law of King Arthur—and to win fame for himself. This trip lead to several more and, in the course of his travels, he jousted various knights, fought a few monsters, fell in love with a widow queen, lost his sanity—albeit shortly—and save helpless women.

Had it been built, it would have been the tallest building in the world by far, being more than four times the height of the then tallest building in the world, the Empire State Building, and it would be nearly twice as tall as the world's current tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. 
The building is one of the visionary buildings meant to be an alternative to the increasing urban sprawl occurring in most cities. None of these has ever been viewed as financially feasible.
The design of the Burj Khalifa, the current tallest building in the world, is said to have been inspired by that of The Illinois.

Havelock Ellis

Henry Havelock Ellis, known as Havelock Ellis (2 February 1859 – 8 July 1939), was a British physician, writer, and social reformer who studied human sexuality. He published works on a variety of sexual practices and inclinations, including transgender psychology. He is credited with introducing the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism, later adopted by psychoanalysis. He served as president of the Galton Institute and, like many intellectuals of his era, supported eugenics.
Attitudes towards homosexuality and masturbation were altered by the publications of Havelock Ellis. Ellis was the first person to say in print that masturbation was normal, and did not cause any medical problems. He was co-author of the first medical textbook in English on homosexuality in 1897. His work, with others, prepared the way for the later sexual revolution.

I have devoted much time and research to this article and believe I've found and included just about every scrap of information on this man. More information will turn up, I'm certain, but I believe there is enough information now to make a good article on Commodore Nutt. His story is heartening and tells me that those who may be perceived by some as disabled can make a productive life for him or herself and may even find great fame and fortune. I hope others will enjoy reading this article as much as I enjoyed writing it! I look forward to your comments and will respond at once. () 23:58, 17 July 2013 (UTC)
Extended to 14th August 2013: As above. 11:18, 7 August 2013 (UTC) 
I will read it later and give my comments about it. Cheers. 05:27, 8 August 2013 (UTC)
I think this is good now. Great job on the references, all look reliable. The only one thing I would mention is that there are quite a few quotations, however brief, with quite complex terms (I had to look up what "drollery" meant). There are several possible ways of dealing with these: you could rewrite them in your own, simpler words, while still attributing them as indirect quotes; or you could append a brief explanation of what they meant; or you could link the terms to Wiktionary. Whatever you do, they're short and used sparingly so it's not a deal-breaker for a good article as far as I'm concerned. () 21:57, 11 August 2013 (UTC)

I was one of the main writers of the that passed GA over there. I have been slowly working on simplifying the article on Simple English Wikipedia. I made the sentences less complex. I tried to use simpler language. (I think I did this well, but if not, please make suggestions for improvement. Simplifying some complex ideas is difficult.) For some of the specialized ski words, I created stub articles that explained more about a topic so there would not be so many red links. The article is fully sourced. It covers the topic comprehensively. I think it is an important article to work on with the 2014 Winter Paralympics coming up. I think it should be a GA because of the things I talked about.

First scan: 
This article is well written, simple, and appealing. We don't have an opera in the VGA archives and I am willing to work on this article to get it there. Because we don't have an article in the VGA archives, I don't have a model. Nor do other editors. IMHO, we need some classic operas and ballets in the VGA archives to serve as models for other editors and in the rotation on the Main Page. I need suggestions for improvement. The Flesch Reading Ease is 62.08 and the Flesch Kincaid Grade level 7.01. I don't think the article at Simple needs long lists of aria and ensemble titles in Italian. Do you? Actually I think the article grades high because of the polysyllabic Italian words in the article. However, I can't see ridding the article of the few that are there. At Simple, the Italian should be kept to the essential minimum to maintain the Reading Ease. I'm not sure our readers need an "Orchestration" section though both paper encyclopedias and enwiki have this sort of section. But these encyclopedias are not written at an 8th grade level either. I'm not sure those reading at an 8th grade level need such as section. The orchestra in most operas and ballets are the standard orchestra of the day: strings, winds, brass, and percussion. This is why I need your help. What should I include and what should I leave out to get this through GA and VGA? I want to produce a good, simple, interesting, informative article for 21st century 8th grade readers. Thanks for your help! () 04:01, 19 September 2013 (UTC)

This is my second attempt to make this article gain some recognition. Now I'm sure that there might be some mistakes, but I can fix them. This article is well written, simple, and hopefully amusing for our readers of all ages. I think this article is simple enough and of course worthy (my opinion) of being a GA. I'm not looking for a future VGA, but please just give me suggestions on how to make this article a GA. I know that some worries may be about Mandela passing away soon (sadly), but that shouldn't be in the way. I promise that if such an event happens I will give my full attention and my full awareness on the article. I want this article to be good and simple, so that future readers may learn about Mandela and his legacy. RIP. I hope the second try is the successful try. Write any suggestions on my talk page --> .

I rarely comment on GA proposals. This one is a reasonable page, but I think it suffers from having almost too many details, yet missing the whole point of the exercise, which is, why is he regarded as a great man? (this is the elephant in the room) I also see some impossible sentences, which need to be disentangled. And it's not clear what is being said about M'Beki (Presidency, third para). Second para (same section): awkward phrasing -- I mean, do you really think the ANC had no "knowledge" of or in politics? Fourth para (same section) has unclear language. No, the more I look, the more I find. () 16:43, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
Kit Carson was a great American. He opened the American West to settlement by trailblazing and destroying the nation's enemies. This article is well written and researched with an eye to making things simple for our users and readers. This in itself is a reason for the article's inclusion in the pantheon of GAs. I will respond to all suggestions for improvement on this article. Thank you. () 19:14, 23 September 2014 (UTC)
Thanks for resolving those issues above, here are some more. I'm afraid that Simple's article on Carson lacks a lot of information (possibly important ones) that are on the enWiki and because of this, all of the subsections are small and pictures overlap them causing a lack of flow. Here are some more comments;

Closed as not promoted per the conversation above. Too many glaring issues at this time for it to be "close" to good article status. If the suggestions being made were minor, it'd be okay to leave this open...but a lot of work is needed. Just glancing at the article, there are 5 paragraphs in the lead; an article of this size with its very small sections and very short paragraphs does not need five paragraphs in the lead.

Ronald Reagan was a great leader and one heck of president. So, as my tribute, I would like to nominate the Ronald Reagan article for a GA status.

Old Chicago Main Post Office Redevelopment

The Old Chicago Main Post Office Redevelopment is a proposed project on a lot located along the Chicago River on the southwest side of Downtown Chicago, Illinois to be constructed in phases over a period of one decade that will include the renovation of Chicago's historic Old Main Post Office building as well as residential, retail, entertainment and office space. 
The plan includes several towers, the tallest one being a proposed 120-story mixed use twin tower skyscraper that will stand about high to the roof, which would make it the tallest building in the United States, over taller than the Willis Tower, and will contain office, residential, and hotel space. It will also include two 60-story residential towers as well as a 40-story hotel. 
All the buildings in the development will be connected via a ground level complex that would be built over the Chicago River and the Eisenhower Expressway.
The proposal was sent to Chicago City Commission in July 2011 for approval, which was expected to be a several month process. The project is said to have an estimated cost of $3.5 billion and the potential to create 12,000 jobs. 
Some critics oppose the proposal in its current state, calling it old-fashioned and suburban and an unrealistic pipe dream, as it is largely car oriented (12,000 parking spaces and free parking) with shopping mall style retail.
The city voted and approved the plan July 18, 2013.

Cri-Cri

Cri-Cri is a fictional talking cricket. The character was created by Francisco Gabilondo Soler and introduced in 1934 on his own musical radio show in Mexico. Cri-Cri is known as "el grillito cantor", which is Spanish for "the singing cricket".
The character was created by Gabilondo Soler when he was a child. It became so famous and gave its author such renown, that it became a second name for Gabilondo. In the mid part of the 20th century, he became the most recognizable singer of children's songs in Spanish. Gabilondo's dedication to this segment of the population has been greatly admired, comparable to Walt Disney in his honest approach to making life fun for those who are beginning to live it.
It was made into a movie that was released on 12 December 1963 in Mexico. It was produced by Producciones Carlos Amador.

Baldwin I, Count of Flanders

Baldwin I († 879), also known as "Baldwin Iron Arm" (), was a French nobleman and became the first count of Flanders. 
Baldwin's father was named Audacer but little else is known of him. His family was related to the counts of Laon. Before holding Flanders Baldwin was already a count, probably at Ghent. Baldwin was in Senlis in 862. Somehow he decided to take Judith, the daughter of Charles the Bald, the king, for his wife. Judith, had been the wife of two English kings, Athelwulf († 858) and Athelbald († 860). On her return and still in her teens she was being held at the castle of Senlis by her father. Baldwin took Judith, the twice daughter of Charles the Bald, 
and the couple fled to the court of Lothair II, king of Lorraine. He was Judith's cousin. Once they were safely out of her father's reach Baldwin married her. This was about 863. King Charles had his bishops excommunicate the couple. He also demanded that his nephew return Baldwin and his daughter Judith to him. At this point Baldwin and Judith fled to Rome. They asked Pope Nicholas I to and their marriage. Baldwin made known his intent to join the Vikings if his marriage was not allowed. Vikings were a constant threat in northern France and Baldwin was needed to help fight them. The pope decided their marriage was valid and had the bishops withdraw their excommunication. Charles the Bald was forced to accept Baldwin as his son-in-law. The couple was married a second time, in public. Her father did not attend but sent officials to witness the marriage. He gave Baldwin the honors the pope recommended. 
Baldwin was given rule over Flanders with the title of (count of a ) of Flanders. He protected Flanders for the next fifteen years from Vikings. He became known for his harsh treatment of anyone attacking Flanders. This later gave him the name "Baldwin Iron Arm". In 867 Baldwin built a castle at Ghent to protect from Viking raids. The city built up around the castle. Ghent became the seat of his . Baldwin also built a castle at Bruges, the port city on the North Sea. It too was for the purpose of stopping Viking . When Charles the Bald died in 877, Baldwin faithfully supported his son, Louis the Stammerer, helping him become king of the Franks. Baldwin died in 879.
Baldwin married Judith (–after 870), daughter of Charles the Bald, King of the Franks and Holy Roman Emperor. Together they had:

Cornelia Meigs

Cornelia Lynde Meigs (December 6, 1884 - September 10, 1973) was an American writer. She wrote many kinds of writing. She wrote made-up stories for children. She wrote true stories for children about the lives of important people. She wrote about important things that happened in the past. She wrote about what books for children were good or bad. She also taught other people how to write in the English language.
One of the books that Cornelia Meigs wrote won the Newbery Medal in 1934. That book was called "Invincible Louisa". It told about the life of Louisa May Alcott. Three other books that Cornelia Meigs wrote were made Newbery Honor Books. That meant that the people who chose the Newbery Medal winner each year thought that those were very good books.
Cornelia Meigs was born in Rock Island, Illinois, on December 6, 1884. Her father was called Montgomery Meigs. Her mother was called Grace Lynde Meigs. Montgomery and Grace already had four other daughters who were older than Cornelia. Later they had one more daughter. 
When Cornelia was one month old, the Meigs family moved to Keokuk, Iowa. Cornelia went to school there. She finished studying at Keokuk High School in 1901. After that, she went to Bryn Mawr College. In 1907, she got an A.B. degree from Bryn Mawr. After that, she went to Davenport, Iowa. She taught children to write good English. The school where she taught was called St. Katherine's School. While she was teaching there, Cornelia started writing books.
The first book that Cornelia wrote was called "The Kingdom of the Winding Road". It was first printed in 1915. Macmillan US was the publisher. In 1921 she wrote "The Windy Hill", and in 1922 that book was made a Newbery Medal Honor Book. In 1929 her fiction book "Clearing Weather" was made a Newbery Honor Book, and in 1933 her fiction book "Swift Rivers" was made a Newbery Honor Book. She also wrote other books for children during this time. Some of these books said that they were written by Adair Aldon. Adair Aldon was a pretend name or pseudonym that Cornelia Meigs used sometimes. "The Trade Wind", which was first printed in 1927, won a prize from Little, Brown, and Co., a book publishing company.
In 1934, Cornelia Meigs won the Newbery Medal for writing the true story book "Invincible Louisa". This book told about the life of Louisa May Alcott, a famous American writer during the 1800s. Kirkus Reviews said that this book was very good. Kirkus Reviews said that children who liked Louisa May Alcott's most famous book, "Little Women", should read "Invincible Louisa" too.
In 1932, Cornelia Meigs started teaching English at Bryn Mawr College. She taught there until 1950. During World War II, she worked for the United States War Department.
After 1950, Cornelia Meigs taught writing at the New School of Social Research in New York City. In 1953, she helped to write a book called "A Critical History of Children's Literature". This was a very important book. It said many things about writing for children. In 1969 she helped to write the second edition of this book.
Cornelia Meigs wrote more than 30 books for children in her life. Most of them were made-up stories. Two of them were true stories about the lives of famous people. Two of her books were plays. She also wrote some books and articles for grown-up people.
Cornelia Meigs died in Havre de Grace, Maryland, on September 10, 1973. She was 88 years old. Most of the papers that she left when she died are in the Special Collections Library at Dartmouth College. Some of her papers are in the de Grummond Collection at the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Some of them are at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa.

Gall wasp

Gall wasps, also called gallflies, are the family (Cynipidae) of the order Hymenoptera. They are in the Apocrita suborder of wasps. About 1300 species of this small creature (1-8 mm) are known worldwide, with about 360 species of 36 different genera in Europe and some 800 species in North America.
The larvae of most gall wasps develop in plant galls they induce themselves.
The plant galls develop after the female insect lays the eggs. The inducement for the gall formation is largely unknown. The hatching larvae nourish themselves with the nutritive tissue of the galls, in which they are otherwise well-protected from external environmental effects. 
70% of the known species live in oak trees. One can find galls on nearly all parts of such trees, some on the leaves, the buds, the branches, and the roots. Other species of gall wasps live in eucalyptus trees, rose bushes or maple trees, as well as many herbs. 
Most species have an alternation of generations, with a two-sex generation and a parthenogenic generation each year. 
A gall provides the developing wasp with a safe refuge for this most vulnerable stage of its life cycle. However, other wasps have found a way to penetrate this defence and parasitise the larva(e) within. 
However, some of these parasitoids use their long, hardened egg-laying tube (ovipositor) to bore into the gall and lay an egg on the helpless gall maker. These parasitoids may, in turn, be preyed upon by other wasps, hyperparasitoids.

Steatorrhea

Steatorrhea means excess undigested fat in feces. In this case, the feces is often lighter, sometimes whitish, in color. It produces a fouler-than-usual, sour-rancid smell, and floats on the surface of the water as opposed to sinking to the bottom of the toilet bowl.
Steatorrhea is caused by the inability to digest and absorb fat in the diet. It may be helped in some cases by taking enzymes, such as those usually produced by the body, which digest fat.
Research should be done, and a doctor consulted if necessary, to determine the cause of the inability to digest and absorb fat.
The causes range from mild to very severe and life-threatenting, so simply treating symptoms may not be enough.

Rockland County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. It is about 20 miles north of downtown New York City. About 300,000 people live there. The county has five towns: Orangetown, Clarkstown, Haverstraw, Stony Point, and Ramapo. The towns are divided into hamlets. The county seat is in New City. The largest village is Spring Valley. Rockland has a minor league baseball team, the Rockland Boulders.
The county was first settled by Native Americans who lived there for many years. It was later found by explorer Henry Hudson when he sailed up the Hudson River in the 1600s. Soon after, many English colonists moved to the area, and formed the first towns. The county was involved in the American Revolution, and an important battle took place there. 
After America won its independence, the county remained mainly rural, meaning most of it was farms and forests. This continued until the Tappan-Zee Bridge and Palisades Parkway were opened in the 1950s. These roads connected the county to New York City, allowing people to drive there. This caused more people to move to Rockland.

Baldwin II, Count of Flanders

Baldwin II ( 865–918), Called Baldwin "the Bald" (), was a French nobleman and the second count of Flanders. He ruled from 879 until his death.
Born he was the son of Baldwin I, Count of Flanders and Judith, a daughter of Charles the Bald. Through his mother he was a descendant of Charlemagne. Baldwin wanted to keep a good trading relationship with England. So in 884 Baldwin married Ælfthryth, a daughter of King Alfred the Great of England. This high profile marriage raised the status of Baldwin II. His children had the distinction of belonging to two of the most important royal houses in western Europe. This and later marked the of Flanders as one of the great houses of Europe. 
When he first started ruling Flanders there were a number of very damaging Viking raids. They everywhere except the area north of the Somme river. By 883 Baldwin was forced northward to the flat marshes of Flanders which became the territory most closely associated with the counts of Flanders from then on. Baldwin had built a series of wooden at Saint-Omer, Bruges, Ghent, and Courtrai. He also seized those lands and fortresses abandoned by royal and church officials. Baldwin had many of these same citadels used by his government, militia and local courts.
In 888 the west Frankish king Charles the Fat was . There were several candidates to be king in his place. Because he was a grandson of Charles the Bald, Holy Roman Emperor and King of West Francia, Baldwin was eligible to be king. But he did not compete for the crown of western Francia. Instead Baldwin joined others in trying to convince the East Frankish king Arnulf to also take the west Frankish crown. But Arnulf was not interested. Odo, Count of Paris, was elected king But Odo did not want Baldwin to gaining control of the abbey of St. Bertin. This was a rich prize and caused Baldwin to not support Odo. The new king attacked Baldwin at Bruges but could not defeat him. Baldwin continued moving his borders to the south and gained control of Artois. He also got control of the important abbey of St. Vaast. When control of the abbey was given to Archbishop Fulk of Reims in 900, Baldwin had him killed. When his attempts to expand further into the upper Somme River valley were opposed by Herbert I, Count of Vermandois Baldwin also had him killed.
Baldwin II died 10 September 918 at Blandinberg (near Ghent) and was succeeded by his eldest son Arnulf I of Flanders. His younger son Adalulf was (the first) count of Boulogne.
He married Elftryth, a daughter of Alfred the Great, King of England. They had the following children:

IPv4 address shortage

Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) has roughly 4 billion IP addresses. This is a problem because there are more than 4 billion Internet-connected computers in the world. This has led to a shortage of IPv4 addresses.
The long term solution is to switch to Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). IPv6 has trillions of trillions of addresses, enough to give every computer in the world a unique IP address. Unfortunately, IPv6 is mostly incompatible with IPv4, and implementing it often requires replacing equipment such as routers. Not all ISPs currently offer IPv6. There are several backward compatibility protocols such as Protocol 41 and Teredo that allow a computer with only an IPv4 address to obtain an IPv6 address.
Network Address Translation (NAT) splits a single public IPv4 address into multiple private IPv4 addresses. It is considered a short term solution because it does not usually allow incoming connections without manual configuration of port forwarding.
Carrier-grade Network Address Translation (CGN or CGNAT) is Network Address Translation done by the Internet Service Provider (ISP). It is a short-term solution to provide IPv4 access where the ISP has more customers than public IP addresses. In this setup, multiple customers share a single public IPv4 address. CGN has the major drawback that it does not allow incoming connections at all, because the address translator does not know which customer an incoming connection was intended for. This makes it impossible or very difficult to host services such as websites or file servers. It also causes problems with some online games, online security cameras, and BitTorrent. Most land-line ISPs don't use CGN yet, but mobile providers often do. The address block 100.64.0.0/10 is reserved for CGN, although many ISPs improperly use 10.0.0.0/8 instead. ISPs that use CGN usually offer a public IPv4 address to customers that request one. They may offer this for free, charge a one-time fee, or charge a monthly or yearly fee. In the future they might not offer public IPv4 addresses or might charge a large fee for them, due to supply and demand.

The Tappan Zee Bridge is a bridge in lower New York. It is three miles long. It goes across the Hudson River. It connects Westchester and Rockland Counties. The bridge opened in 1955. It took traffic from other bridges and ferries in the area. The bridge is about 25 miles north of New York City. The city can be seen from the bridge on a clear day. The bridge carries seven lanes of the New York State Thruway.
The bridge is named for a Native American tribe from the area called the "Tappan". "Zee" is the Dutch word for "sea", as the bridge crosses water.
Because the bridge is old and now gets a lot of traffic, it needs to be replaced with something safer and larger. People in the region have been arguing to build the new bridge for many years.
In 2013, the New York State Thruway Authority began building the New Tappan Zee Bridge. It will be a double-span bridge (four lanes per span in opposite directions) with designated bus lanes. The new bridge is planned to be ready to open in 2018.
An October 14, 2012, "Newsday" article reports the Tappan Zee Bridge has been referred to as the Golden Gate Bridge of the East because of many suicide jumpers. The article says "The new Tappan Zee, which is in the works, will include fencing designed to thwart jumpers."

In some cultures and families, it is common to call the child of one's cousin a "niece" or "nephew". In old English, the son of one's sister was called a "sister-son".
A grand-nephew (male) or grand-niece (female) is the child of someone's nephew or niece, the grandchild of someone's brother or sister. Grand-niece and grand-nephew are often inaccurately referred to as great-nephew or great-niece, as recently stated here.

Arnulf I, Count of Flanders

Arnulf of Flanders (–964), called the Great, was a French nobleman and the third count of Flanders. He ruled from 918 until his death. He ruled an expanded County of Flanders, an area that is now northwestern Belgium and southwestern Netherlands.
Arnulf, born , was the son of count Baldwin II, Count of Flanders and Ælfthryth of Wessex. She was a daughter of Alfred the Great. Through his mother he was a descendant of the Anglo-Saxon kings of England. Through his father he was a descendant of Charlemagne. Arnulf was named after Saint Arnulf of Metz, a of the Carolingian dynasty.
At the death of their father in 918 Arnulf became Count of Flanders. His brother Adelolf succeeded to the County of Boulogne. When Adeloft died in 933 Arnulf took control of Boulogne and Ternois. His nephews were still young so it was probably as their guardian. Later he gave the of Boulogne to his nephew, Arnulf II.
Arnulf I greatly expanded Flemish rule to the south. He took over all or part of Artois, Ponthieu, Amiens, and Ostrevent. Arnulf exploited the conflicts between Charles the Simple and Robert I of France, and later those between Louis IV and his barons. In his southern expansion Arnulf had conflict with the Normans. They were trying to secure their northern frontier. This led to the 942 murder of the Duke of Normandy, William Longsword, at the hands of Arnulf's men. The Vikings became less of a threat during the later years of Arnulf's life. He worked on reforming his county government.
Arnulf's son, Baldwin III died in 962 leaving Arnold a crisis of succession. Baldwin's son Arnulf II 'the Young' was still a child and his succession was disputed. Arnulf offered the king, Lothair of France, Artois, Ponthieu, and Ostrevant in exchange for the king's protection of Arnulf II. His grandson inherited a weakened county of Flanders when he came of age. Arnold died on 27 March 964.
The name of Arnulf's first wife is unknown but he had at least one daughter by her:
In 934 he married Adele of Vermandois, daughter of Herbert II of Vermandois. Their children were:

Baldwin III, Count of Flanders

Baldwin III of Flanders called The Young (–962) was a French nobleman and briefly was the fourth count of Flanders. He ruled jointly with his father Arnulf I.
Baldwin III was born , the son of Arnulf I, Count of Flanders and his second wife, Adele of Vermandois (c. 915 – 969). She was a daughter of Herbert II, Count of Vermandois. Baldwin became co-ruler of Flanders in 958 alongside his father Arnulf I. During his short rule, Baldwin was responsible for establishing the wool manufacturing industry at Ghent and markets at other towns in Flanders. Baldwin III died on 1 January 962 of smallpox. He was buried at the Abbey of Saint Bertin. 
After Baldwin's death, Arnulf I arranged for King Lothair of France to become the guardian of Baldwin's son Arnulf II.
Shortly before 961 Baldwin married Mathilde of Saxony († 1008). She was a daughter of Hermann Billung(† 973), Duke of Saxony. They had a son:

Emulsion

Putting two or more liquids together creates an emulsion if the liquids do not mix. Immiscible liquids do not mix together. For example, if you add oil to water, the oil floats on the surface of the water. And if you shake the two together then leave them to stand, tiny droplets of oil float upwards. These droplets join together until eventually the oil is floating on the water again. To stop the two liquids separating, we need a substance called an emulsifier.
Emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends:
a hydrophilic end (water-loving) that forms chemical bonds with water but not with oils
, and a hydrophobic end (water-hating) that forms chemical bonds with oils but not with water.

Goliath birdeater spider

The Goliath birdeater spider is one of the largest spiders in the world. It is a tarantula. It lives in burrows in swampy areas of northern South America. It eats insects, rodents, bats, small birds, lizards, frogs, and snakes. The spiders have fangs, but their venom is harmless to people. Hairs on their bodies can irritate human skin. Explorers named the spider when they saw one eating a hummingbird. 
The female lays 100 to 200 eggs. The babies hatch in two months. The female spiders sometimes eat their mates. Females can live about 20 years, but males only live 3 to 6 years. These spiders can have a leg span of up to and a body length of up to . They can weigh up to . The spider's living areas are threatened by real estate development.

Judith, Countess of Flanders

Judith of Flanders (or Judith of the Franks) (–), was a member of the Frankish Royal family, twice Queen of Wessex, and by her third marriage Countess of Flanders. 
Judith was the eldest daughter of the Frankish King and Holy Roman Emperor Charles the Bald and his wife Ermentrude of Orléans. She was born about 844. Judith inherited her name and her willful temperament from her grandmother, Judith of Bavaria. In 855 King Æthelwulf of Wessex made a to Rome, remaining there about a year. On his return in 856 he stayed at the court of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles the Bald. In July Æthelwulf became engaged to Judith, Charles' oldest daughter. She was at most thirteen years of age at the time.
On 1 October 856 they were married at Verberie in northern France. The marriage was at best a diplomatic alliance. Both men were suffering from Viking attacks, and formed a common alliance. Charles insisted that his daughter be queen. He wanted her position in England. At her she was anointed with , usually reserved for anointing bishops and kings. 
Up to this time in Wessex they did not allow queens. The king's wife was just that, the king's wife. When Æthelwulf first ordered his new queen to sit beside him it caused concern among his people. In Wessex there were old regarding the evil of having a queen. But his order was obeyed without any objections from his nobles. Judith had no children by Æthelwulf, who died in 858. He was succeeded by his son Æthelbald, who married Judith, his step-mother. The marriage was by Asser as well as, according to him, all who heard of it. Two and a half years later Æthelbald died leaving her a widow a second time.
Judith returned to France the widow of her own stepson. To avoid scandal her father was keeping her under close guard at his castle at Senlis. He was looking for a new husband for her so she could be quietly married. Baldwin was already a count, probably at Ghent. He was in Senlis in early 862. Baldwin either abducted or convinced Judith to run off with him. The fact she slipped out of the castle dressed as a peasant girl seems to point to her cooperation. She also had help from her brother Lewis. When her father discovered what had happened he was furious. He was furious with Lewis as well. Baldwin and Judith fled to the court of Lothair II, king of Lorraine. He was Judith's cousin. Once they were safely out of her father's reach Baldwin married her. This was about 862. King Charles had his bishops excommunicate the couple. He also demanded that his nephew return Baldwin and his daughter Judith to him. At this point Baldwin and Judith wisely fled to Rome. They asked Pope Nicholas I to and their marriage. Baldwin made known his intent to join the Vikings if his marriage was not allowed. Vikings were a constant threat in northern France and Baldwin was needed to help fight them. The pope decided their marriage was valid and had the bishops withdraw their excommunication. Charles the Bald was forced to accept Baldwin as his son-in-law. By her marriage Judith became the first Countess of Flanders. Baldwin was given rule over Flanders with the title of (count of a ) of Flanders. He protected Flanders for the next fifteen years from Vikings. Judith was last known to be living in 870. Baldwin died in 879.
Judith gave her descendants, the counts of Flanders and Boulogne, the status of from Charlemagne. She was also an of Matilda of Flanders, the consort of William the Conqueror, and thus of later monarchs of England.
By her first husband, Æthelwulf, King of Wessex, she had no children.
By her second husband, Æthelbald, King of Wessex, she had no children.
By her third husband, Baldwin I of Flanders, Judith's children included:

Coupling constant

Every force has a coupling constant, which is a measure of its strength in an interaction. The coupling constant determines the chances of one particle to emit or absorb another particle. In electromagnetism, for example, the coupling constant is based on the electric charge. A coupling constant plays an important role in dynamics.
When physicists study the quantum behaviour of electromagnetism, they can not solve the whole theory exactly, because every particle may emit and absorb many other particles, which may also do the same, endlessly. So events of emission and absorption are considered as perturbations and are dealt with by a series of approximations.
This also can happen in string theory. String theories have a coupling constant. It determines the probability that a 1-dimensional string of energy will separate into "two" separate energy strings. But unlike in particle theories, the string coupling constant is not just a number, but depends on one of the oscillation modes of the string.

Ribozyme

A ribozyme (ribonucleic acid enzyme) is an RNA molecule that can help certain biochemical reactions. similar to the action of protein enzymes. 
Also called "catalytic RNA", ribozymes work in the ribosome to link amino acids during protein synthesis. They also take part in RNA splicing, viral replication, and transfer RNA biosynthesis. 
The 1981 discovery of ribozymes showed RNA can be both genetic material (like DNA) and a biological catalyst (like enzymes). This led to the RNA world hypothesis, in which RNA acts in the evolution of prebiotic self-replicating systems. 
Investigators studying the origin of life have produced ribozymes in the laboratory that can catalyze their own synthesis under certain conditions, such as an RNA polymerase ribozyme. Improved variants of the "Round-18" polymerase ribozyme have been developed. "B6.61" is able to add up to 20 nucleotides to a primer template in 24 hours, until it decomposes by cleavage of its phosphodiester bonds. The "tC19Z" ribozyme can add up to 95 nucleotides with great accuracy.
Some ribozymes may play an important role as therapeutic agents, as enzymes which target defined RNA sequences for cleavage, as biosensors, and for applications in genomics and gene discovery.
In 1967, Carl Woese, Francis Crick, and Leslie Orgel suggested that RNA could act as a catalyst. It was discovered that RNA can form complex secondary structures.
The first ribozymes were discovered in the 1980s. In 1989, Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their "discovery of catalytic properties of RNA".

Adventure movie

Adventure movies are a genre of movies. They contain many of the same features of action movies, but are usually set in exotic locations. The main theme is adventure, with the characters often exploring places they have not been before or doing things they have not done before. Common storylines include quests for lost treasure, heroic journeys for the unknown, and jungle or desert settings. Adventure movies are often set in an historical time and may be based on stories of historical or fictional adventure heroes within the historical context. Kings, battles, rebellion or piracy are commonly seen in adventure movies. Adventure movies may also be combined with other movie genres, such as science fiction, fantasy and sometimes war movies. 
The adventure movie was most popular in Hollywood during the 1930s and 1940s. Movies such as "Captain Blood", "The Adventures of Robin Hood" and "The Mark of Zorro" were regularly made with major stars, notably Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power, who were closely associated with the genre. In the earliest adventure movies, the main character was usually male. They were portrayed as courageous heroes, facing tyrants or rescuing a beautiful woman in distress.
Adventure movies usually emphasise the mystery, romance, adventure, danger, and terror of the unknown. Common settings include a jungle or desert. Classic dangers include ferocious man-eating mammals and reptiles, hostile natives, deadly diseases, lost cities and crumbling temples, torrential rivers, waterfalls, whirlpools, and quicksand bogs, damsels in distress, evil emirs and treacherous tribal chieftains, and despicable white adventurers from the civilized world intent on exploiting the jungle, its animals, treasures, resources, and primitive native peoples. 
Adventure movies may crossover into other genres such as war, crime, romance, or horror.
Notable examples of jungle adventure movies include "King Kong" (adventure, romance, horror), "The African Queen" (romance, adventure), "I Walked with a Zombie" (romance, horror), Disney's animated "The Jungle Book" (children's, comedy, musical), "Apocalypse Now" (war), and the many Bomba movies, and the Tarzan movies and serials. Since the first theatrical releases of jungle movies in the early 20th century, popular interest in the genre has never waned. Comic books, novels, pulp magazines, and television series have stoked the genre's popularity over the decades.

Fernand Léger

Fernand Léger (Joseph Fernand Henri Léger, 4 February 1881 – 17 August 1955) was a French painter, sculptor, and filmmaker. In his early works he created a personal form of cubism which he gradually changed into a more popular figurative style. His boldly simplified treatment of modern subject matter made him a forerunner of pop art.
His personal style was called "tubism" because it was influenced by cubism, but used tube-like forms.

Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum

The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (often referred to as "The Guggenheim") is a well-known art museum on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City. It is the permanent home of a renowned and continuously expanding collection of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, early Modern and contemporary art. It also has special exhibitions during the year. 
The museum was started by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1939 as the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, under the guidance of its first director, the artist Hilla von Rebay. The name was changed to honor the founder, Solomon R. Guggenheim, after his death in 1952.
Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, the cylindrical museum building is wider at the top than the bottom. He wanted it to be a "temple of the spirit". The building is one of the 20th century's most important architectural landmarks. The building opened on October 21, 1959, replacing rented spaces used by the museum since 1939.
To design the museum, Wright created more than 700 sketches until the final draft of the project was official. Wright spent 16 years working on the design, but he died before the building was completed. His design created a lot of arguments as many people did not like it. One person said it looked like "an indigestible hot cross bun", and another said it looked like "an inverted oatmeal dish." Some artists thought that the curved walls and ramps would make it impossible to hang their paintings properly.

Baldwin V, Count of Flanders

Baldwin V of Flanders (1012–1067) known as Baldwin de Lille or Baldwin de Insulanus, was a French nobleman and the Count of Flanders. He ruled from 1035 until his death. Baldwin was one of the most powerful counts in France at the time.
He was the son of Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders and his first wife Ogive of Luxembourg. She was a daughter of Frederick of Luxembourg, In 1028 Baldwin married Adèle of France She was the daughter of King Robert II of France. At her instigation he rebelled against his father, Baldwin IV, but in 1030 they were reconciled. When his father died in 1035 Baldwin succeeded him.
While Eustace I, Count of Boulogne was usually at odds with Baldwin IV, he and Baldwin V had friendly relations. They signed each other's and worked together several times. Eustace I signed three charters of Baldwin's which limited the power of . 
Flanders under Baldwin V did not have very good relations with England. Baldwin gave refuge to England's and even gave them ships and men at times. He protected Queen Emma 1036-1040 as well as her two sons Alfred and Harthacnut. When Earl Godwin, Earl of Wessex and his family were exiled by Edward the Confessor in 1051-2, Baldwin welcomed them. He also helped them to prepare their return to England. In turn Edward the Confessor positioned his fleet off the coast of Flanders while Baldwin V was warring with Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor in 1049. This threat caused Baldwin to sue for peace with the Emperor. 
Baldwin V had a great deal of influence due in part to several marriages alliance between Flanders and England, France and Germany. He was close to his , Henry I,the king of France. From 1060 to 1067 Baldwin was the Regent for his nephew Philip I of France. In 1051 Baldwin had Richildis, the widow of Count Herman of Hainault, to marry his son Baldwin VI. This gave him control of Hainault through his son. This also led to a series of conflicts between Baldwin V and Emperor Henry III, as Hainault was part of the Holy Roman Empire. After a series of defeats Henry III withdrew back to Germany and died a short time later. In 1056 Baldwin received the whole of the Schelt march as a fief from Agnes of Poitou, regent for her son Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. Baldwin's daughter Matilda married William I of England, later king of England. At first the marriage was banned by Pope Leo IX. He did not give a reason but it was probably because the two were cousins. Some time between 1050 and 1052 the two married despite the ban. Although Baldwin allowed some Flemish support for his Norman conquest of England relations between Baldwin and his son-in-law William the Conqueror were not that friendly. The English king was wary of Baldwin's growing power. But by then Baldwin was growing old. He died 1 September 1067.
Baldwin and his wife Adèle had three children:

American Airlines Flight 587

American Airlines Flight 587 was a scheduled commercial flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City to Las Américas International Airport in the Dominican Republic. The aircraft used was a Airbus A300-600. On November 12, 2001, the aircraft crashed into the Belle Harbor neighborhood of Queens, New York. All 260 people on the flight were killed. Five people on the ground were also killed. The crash was caused by the failure of the plane's tail because of pilot error in wake turbulence (turbulence that forms behind an airplane as it goes through the air). It is the second-deadliest plane crash in the United States after American Airlines Flight 191, which occurred on May 25, 1979.
The accident took place two months and one day after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in Manhattan. This made people think that the crash was caused by terrorism.
American Airlines Flight 587,an Airbus A300B4-605R registration (N14053) was piloted by Captain Ed States, (42) and First Officer Sten Molin, (34). The First Officer was flying the plane. Most of the passengers on-board were Americans, but 68 were Dominicans as well, there were also five Indonesians, three Taiwanese, two Canadians, two Australians, two Brazilians, one French, one German, one Haitian, one Italian, one Japanese, one Dutch, one Israeli, one Mexican, one British, and one Swiss passengers on-board.
Flight 587 was scheduled to leave John F Kennedy at 08:00 for a flight to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The boarding process at gate 22 took a little longer than planned due to additional security procedures that delayed boarding. The gate was closed at 08:38 and push-back from the gate was accomplished at 9:00. The crew taxied to runway 31L behind Japan Airlines Flight 047, a Boeing 747-400 bound for Tokyo, Narita. Japan Airlines Flight 047 was cleared for takeoff at 9:11am, as the 747 climbed, the tower contacted Flight 587’s pilots and warned them about potential wake turbulence from the 747.
At 9:13:28 Flight 587 was cleared for takeoff from Runway 31L. The aircraft left the runway at 9:14:29, about 1 minute and 40 seconds after the JAL flight. From takeoff, the plane climbed to an altitude of 500 ft above mean sea level (msl) and then entered a climbing left turn to heading of 220. At 9:15:00, the pilot made initial contact with the departure controller informing him that the airplane was at 1,300 ft and climbing to 5,000 ft. The departure controller instructed the aircraft to maintain 13,000 ft.
At 9:15:36, when the aircraft hit wake turbulence from the JAL flight just in front of it. The first officer attempted to stabilise the aircraft with alternating aggressive rudder inputs from left to right. This continued for at least 20 seconds, until 9:15:56, when the stress of the first officer’s repeated rudder movements caused the lugs that attached the vertical stabilizer and rudder to fail. The stabilizer separated from the aircraft and fell into Jamaica Bay, about one mile north of the main wreckage site.
Eight seconds later, the stall warning sounded on the cockpit voice recorder. At the moment the stabilizer separated from the aircraft, the plane pitched downwards, headed straight for Belle Harbor. As the pilots struggled to control the aircraft, it went into a flat spin. The resulting aerodynamic loads sheared both engines from the aircraft seconds before impact. The engines landed several blocks north and east of the main wreckage site. Losing the engines cut off power to the FDR at 9:16:00, while the CVR cut off at 9:16:15 moments before impact.
The fuselage slammed into Belle Harbor on Beach 131st Street, instantly destroying three houses. All 260 people aboard the plane and five people on the ground were killed instantly, and the impact forces and post-crash fire destroyed the wreckage.
The investigation into the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 was led by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).
They concluded that the probable cause of the in-flight separation of the vertical stabilizer was the result of the loads beyond ultimate design that were created by the first officer’s unnecessary and excessive rudder pedal inputs. Contributing to these rudder pedal inputs were characteristics of the A300-600 rudder system design and elements of the American Airlines Aircraft Manoeuvring Program.

Altered state of consciousness

An altered state of consciousness (ASC), or altered state of mind, is any condition which is significantly different from a normal waking state. The expression was used in 1966 by Arnold M. Ludwig, and brought into common usage by Charles Tart. It describes induced changes in one's mental state, almost always temporary. A synonymous phrase is "altered state of awareness".
Altered states of consciousness can be associated with artistic creativity, or different focus levels. They also can be shared between people and studied as a subject of sociological research.
During an altered state of consciousness, brain waves occupy different frequencies (i.e. Epsilon, Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma). These waves can be measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Also, subjective reports and observer reports of behaviour are used to identify the altered state.

Autopoiesis

Autopoiesis refers to life and other self-organising systems. The word means "self creation or self-production". It refers to a system which can reproduce and sustain itself. 
The term was introduced in 1972 by Chilean biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela to define the self-maintaining chemistry of living cells. Since then the concept has also been applied to systems theory and sociology. 
Autopoiesis was a modern definition for life, plus any other systems with lifelike properties. To qualify for the name "autopoiesis" a system would need to show three main features:
Roth commented that "In short, organisms are self-reproducing and self-maintaining, or 'autopoietic', systems". This approach makes use of molecular biology ideas and systems science ideas, but it does not refer to the particular way life is organised on Earth. This is because the authors thought it was possible for machines to have those features, and for other types of life to exist.

Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders

Baldwin VI of Flanders (–1070), called Baldwin de Mons was a Frankish nobleman. He was the ruling Count of Hainaut ("jure uxoris") from 1051 to 1070 (as Baldwin I) and succeeded his father as Count of Flanders from 1067 to 1070.
Baldwin was the oldest son of Baldwin V, Count of Flanders and Adela of France. Adela was a daughter of king Robert II of France. and Constance of Arles. He was also the brother of Matilda of Flanders, Queen consort of England and wife of William the Conqueror, King of England.
His father arranged his marriage, under threat of arms, to Richilde, Countess of Hainaut. She was the widow of Herman of Mons and heiress of Hainaut. Because Hainaut was a part of the Holy Roman Empire this enraged Emperor Henry III who had not been consulted. He went to war against the two Baldwins but was not successful. Between 1050 and 1054 Lambert II, Count of Lens fought alongside the Baldwins against Henry III. He was one of Baldwin V's leading vassals. Lambert was killed at the battle of Lille in 1054. Others fighting for the Counts of Flanders against Henry III included the lords of Alost.
Richilde son Roger, from her first marriage, was thought by her not fit to be the next count of Hainaut. Baldwin and Richilde arranged for him to be the Bishop of Chalons. This allowed her son by her second marriage, Baldwin (II) to become the count of Hainaut. Her daughter by her first husband became a nun. Baldwin acquired the remainder of the county of Hainaut by fiefs and by purchasing allods. Baldwin died 17 Jul 1070. His early death left Flanders and Hainaut in the hands of his young son Arnulf III, with Richilde as regent.
Baldwin rebuilt the monastery of Hasnon and gave gifts of his own properties to support it. He placed monks there and made it his burial place.
Baldwin and Richilde were the parents of:

Arnulf succeeded his father Baldwin in 1070. His mother Richilde, Countess of Mons and Hainaut was his regent. Robert the Frisian, Baldwin VI's brother and Arnulf III's uncle, challenged
Arnulf's succession to Flanders. He began gathering supporters mainly in northern Flanders (where the bulk of Arnulf's forces were located). Arnulf's ranks contained individuals such as Count Eustace II, Count of Boulogne, his son Eustace III, and Godfrey of Bouillon (future king of Jerusalem). Arnulf was also supported by King Philip I of France who knighted Arnulf at the time. His uncle, William the Conqueror sent Arnulf ten Norman knights led by William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford.

Piano Concerto No. 20 (Mozart)

The Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, K. 466 is a piece of music for solo piano and orchestra. It was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart between January and February 1785. Mozart first performed the concerto in Vienna, Austria, on February 11, 1785. The concerto is very dramatic. It has always been popular with musicians and music lovers. 
The Piano Concerto in D minor was written by Mozart between the third week of January 1785 and February 10 of the same year. The next day, his father Leopold Mozart arrived in Vienna from Salzburg, Austria for a 10-week stay. That evening, Mozart performed the concerto at the Mehlgrube Casino. Leopold wrote his daughter Nannerl: "We arrived at 1 o'clock ... the copyist was still copying the new concerto and your poor brother did not have enough time to play through the Rondo because he had to supervise the copying ... On the same evening we drove to the first of his six subscription concerts. A great many members of the aristocracy were present. They each pay three ducats for these Lenten concerts ... Your brother is giving them at the Mehlgrube ... The concert was magnificent and the orchestra played splendidly ... A female singer from the Italian theatre sang two arias then we had the new and very fine concerto." Mozart played the concerto again at the Burgtheater on February 15, 1785.
The Piano Concerto in D minor is a moody, chromatic work of passionate, troubled, and dramatic outbursts. The work was a favorite of 19th century musiciansin spite of its 75-measure "happy ending" in D major. Nineteenth century musicians typically did not like "happy endings" in intensely dramatic, turbulent works such as this concerto. The Piano Concerto in D minor is the first of only two concertos Mozart wrote in minor keys. The other is the Piano Concerto in C minor.
The Piano Concerto in D minor is written for solo piano, flute, 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani, and strings. This was the first time Mozart used trumpets and drums in a piano concerto.
Mozart did not write cadenzas for the concerto. His son, Franz Xavier Wolfgang Mozart, was a pianist-composer who had the concerto in his repertory, and wrote cadenzas for it.
Beethoven also had the D minor concerto in his repertory though he did not usually perform the compositions of other composers. He did however perform the Piano Concerto in D minor several times. He wrote cadenzas for the first and third movements. In his cadenza for the first movement, Beethoven plunges the listener into a world of powerful, frightening, and intense drama.

If they do not play a word, they can swap tiles with ones not yet used, or simply pass their turn. Words can be placed up and down, or left and right. Players want to score as many points as they can.
DW tiles double the value of a word. TW tiles triple the score of a word. When all 7 tiles are used in one move, 35 bonus points are scored.
The game will end if a player plays all their tiles, and there are no more tiles in the bag. Also, if 3 moves that score 0 points are played one after the other, the game will end. However, this does not apply if both players’ score is zero. After the last tile is played, the other player will lose points equal to the score of their tiles. These points are given to the person who played the last tile. The player with the highest score wins.
Players can move their tiles around, or shuffle them by pressing a button, or by shaking the device. Players can quit games if they want to. The game has two more features, “tile bag” and “word-o-meter”, both can be used for free. 
173,000 words can be played. The list of words used is based on the Enhanced North American Benchmark Lexicon (ENABLE), and some words are added by Zynga, including "QI" and "ZEN".
The game was made by Shawn Lohstroh for brothers Paul and David Bettner, the owners of Newtoy Inc. at the time.
In 2012, Zynga made many physical board game versions of "Words with Friends" with Hasbro. This includes a normal version, a “Luxe” version with a turning gameboard, and a “To Go” travel edition. 
Many other games by Zynga have been released as board games, including "Draw Something", a "CityVille" edition of "Monopoly", and many kids' games like "FarmVille".
Similar games include a math version "Math With Your Friends", a numbers game "Five-O" for iOS, an arithmetic game"GoSum" for iOS, "Letterpress" for iOS, "Alphajax" for Windows Phone, "Word Derby" for iOS, "Spellathon", another numbers game "Yushino" for iOS, "Word Frenzy", "Word Mix", Wordfeud, "7 Little Words", and "Chiktionary".

<doc id="415349" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=415349" title="Ableism">
Ableism

Ableism or ablecentrism is prejudice towards disabled people. The first known use of the word was in 1981, which makes it relatively new. However, the concept of ableism existed before this. 'Disablism' can be used to mean the same thing.
Ableism can be intentional or unintentional. People can be ableist (prejudiced towards disabled people) unintentionally because ableism is so common that people may not notice that it exists. A person who holds such a prejudice is called an "ablecentrist". Some people say that ableism is a form of oppression. Not everyone who talks about ableism agrees about what things are ableist. Disabled people can be ableist, to other disabled people or to themselves, which is called internalized ableism. Some people deny that ableism exists. 
In some countries, there are laws that are made to protect disabled people from ableist discrimination and Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities also prohibits such discriminations.
Ableism takes many forms around the world. Sometimes ableism is done in a way that is supposed to be hurtful. Other times people are ableist while they are trying to be nice. Both of these types of ableism are harmful.
Society is not built for disabled people. For example, there are lots of shops that are not accessible for people who use wheelchairs because the person who made the shop was able-bodied so they didn't consider that people in wheelchairs wouldn't be able to move around comfortably, or they thought of this but didn't care.
Disabled people are often victims of abuse. The people who abuse them are usually people without disabilities. They may be abused because their disability makes them vulnerable. Sometimes a person is abused just because they are disabled. This is called disability hate crime. A disability hate crime can take the form of murder. A lot of these murders are by care givers such as the mothers of disabled people. A hate crime does not have to be to a person directly. For example, a person might write an ableist slur on a disabled person's car to make them feel bad about being disabled. Many thousands of disability hate crimes are reported every year in the UK. Disability hate crimes are often not reported. This means that the statistics make the problem seem smaller than it is.
A common way that disabled people are abused is 'disability bullying'. People think of bullying as something that just happens to children at school that is not serious. This is not true. Bullying happens to people of all ages. Bullying causes long-term psychological problems such as low self-esteem. Some people kill themselves because they have been bullied. Mencap, a charity that helps people with intellectual disability, asked over 500 disabled children and young people about bullying in a survey. 8 out of 10 children with a learning disability said that they are bullied and are scared to go out because they are scared they will be bullied.
More than 90% of developmentally disabled people are sexually abused in their lifetimes. 49% are sexually abused more than 10 times. The rate of sexual abuse in the general population is lower.
81% of non-disabled people who are at the age that people work have a job. 48% of disabled people who are at the age that people work have a job. 50% of disabled people who don't have a job want to have a job, but can not find a job. Sometimes disabled people are not given jobs even if they are capable of doing the jobs because the people giving the jobs (employers) think that disabled people are not as good as non-disabled people.
The English language has been criticized for being ableist. For example, young people sometimes say that something is 'retarded' when they mean that it is bad. This can be offensive to disabled people.
In World War Two, many thousands of disabled people were murdered by Nazis. The Nazis did this because they believed in non-voluntary euthanasia and forced eugenics, which is a philosophy that advocates reproduction by humans with 'desirable' traits and discourages reproduction by humans with 'undesirable' traits. They thought that disability is bad and disabled people are a burden on society. Many people still believe those things. In 2013 a councillor in the UK called Colin Brewer said that disabled children 'should be put down' to save money. He was found guilty of misconduct but the council could not fire him.
Disabled people are sometimes forcibly sterilized. This is often illegal because reproduction is considered a human right. 
According to "The Telegraph", it is legal to have an abortion up to 40 weeks in a pregnancy if the fetus is disabled in the UK. Some people say that this law should be changed.
In 2011, a book called "Scapegoat: Why we are failing disabled people" was published. The book was written by Katharine Quarmby. It is about hate crimes towards disabled people in the United Kingdom.

Lance Storm

Lance Evers (born April 3, 1969) is a semi-retired Canadian professional wrestler known under the ring name Lance Storm and is best known for his time in known for his work in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Ring of Honor (ROH).
He currently runs a professional wrestling school in Calgary, Alberta called Storm Wrestling Academy.
He joined Extreme Championship Wrestling in 1997. He competed for ECW from 1997 to 2000. During that time, he won the ECW World Tag Team Championship with Chris Candido. They held the belts for 200 days and broke up. They feuded with each other after that and Storm introduced Tammy Lynn Bytch as his manager. The name Tammy Lynn Bytch was a parody of Candido's real life girlfriend Tammy Lynn Sytch.
After their feud was finished, Storm teamed with his trainee Justin Credible and named their tag team the Impact Players. The team won two ECW World Tag Team Championships and feuded with Jerry Lynn and Sabu and Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman. He also worked as a booker in ECW but left for the World Championship Wrestling to support his family when the company began to suffer financial hardships.
He joined World Championship Wrestling in 2000 and won the United States Heavyweight Championship, the Cruiserweight Championship, and the Hardcore Championship in rapid succession. He renamed the titles to the Canadian Heavyweight Championship, 100 kg and Under Championship, and Saskatchewan Hardcore International Title (S.H.I.T.) which also featured large stickers that covered the belts' faceplates.
He was also a member of the wrestling stable Team Canada which also featured Mike Awesome, Jim Duggan, Major Gunns, Carl Oulette, Jacques Rougeau, Elix Skipper and also Bret Hart for one night. The stable feuded with Misfits In Action. 
The WCW was purchased World Wrestling Federation in 2001 and portrayed as a serious, humourless heel. He was a member of The Alliance and was also the first WCW wrestler to invade a WWF program on the May 28, 2001 episode of Raw.
During his time in WWF, he won the WWE Intercontinental Championship and formed a tag team with The Hurricane. Storm and Hurricane feuded with the Hardy Boyz over the WWF and WCW Tag Team Titles. Team Alliance lost at the 2001 Survivor Series and Storm was fired (in storyline) along with the rest of the alliance roster by Vince McMahon.
Storm defeated The Rock with help from Test in a match which earned Storm a WWF contract. Storm formed The Un-Americans along with Christian, Test, and later William Regal. The Un-Americans lead angry tirades against the United States and waved an inverted American flag in the ring. Storm and Christian defeated Hulk Hogan and Edge at Vengeance to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. 
The stable broke up but Storm continued to tag with Regal with the same type of gimmick. With Regal, Storm won the World Tag Team Championship twice. Regal had health problems and Chief Morley said that they would be stripped of the titles. Morley teamed with Storm and they were named the World Tag Team Champions.
He was involved in a storyline where Stone Cold Steve Austin, who was an authority figure at the time, told the fans to chant "boring" during Storm's matches. Goldust helped improve Storm's charisma and turn Storm into a fan favorite. He reformed his tag team with Morley but they didn't really get a push.
He turned into a heel again and was tired of pleasing the fans and how it was just a waste of his time. He was squashed by Rhyno immediately thereafter which turned Rhyno into a fan favorite once again. This would turn out to be Storm's last appearance on Raw.
In April 2004, he then decided to retire from in-ring action and accepted a position backstage with WWE where he worked as a wrestling trainer in Ohio Valley Wrestling. He resigned from WWE in May 2005 and intended to open his own training school in his hometown of Calgary, the Storm Wrestling Academy. After he left the WWE, Storm competed in the Independent circuit for a while which also included Ring of Honor. He still competes in the independent circuit from time to time. 
Since retiring, he runs a professional wrestling school in Calgary, Alberta called Storm Wrestling Academy.
He is married to his wife Tina and they have two daughters, Rachel and Rebecca.

Shoemaking

Shoemaking is the process of making footwear. Originally, shoes were made one at a time by hand. Traditional handicraft shoemaking has now been overtaken in numbers by industrial mass production, but not necessarily in quality. Shoemakers may produce a range of footwear items, including shoes, boots, sandals, clogs and moccasins. Such items are generally made of leather, wood, rubber, plastic, jute or other plant material.
A cordwainer is a shoemaker who makes very fine soft leather shoes. A cobbler is someone who repairs shoes.

On February 7, 1984, he earned the WWF Junior Heavyweight Championship when he won a tournament in New Japan Pro Wrestling; even though it was a WWF Title, it was mostly defended in Japan. He defeated his cousin Davey Boy Smith earlier in the tournament, and then defeated The Cobra in the finals.
He debuted in the WWF on August 29, 1984 and teamed with Bret Hart where they defeated Iron Mike Sharpe and Troy Alexander in a match that was eventually shown on September 15, 1984, on the Maple Leaf Garden broadcast.
He ended up teaming with Davey Boy Smith and formed the British Bulldogs, while Bret would team with Jim Neidhart and formed The Hart Foundation. The two teams had matches against each other which usually ended in No-Contests. The British Bulldogs, accompanied by Captain Lou Albano and Ozzy Osbourne, defeated Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake at WrestleMania II.
During a tag match against Don Muraco and Bob Orton, he was injured. He would be substituted by several wrestlers which included Roddy Piper, Junkyard Dog and Billy Jack Haynes when tag title defenses were made. When he was recovering in the hospital from back surgery, he recounted that Bret Hart had showed up and said that Vince McMahon had sent him to get Dynamite's tag belt but Billington refused. He would shortly check himself out of the hospital (against doctors' orders) and met with McMahon, who requested that the Bulldogs drop the tag titles to the team of Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik but Billington refused and said that he would only drop the belts to The Hart Foundation.
The British Bulldogs wrestled a match on January 26, 1987 and dropped the titles to The Hart Foundation. During the match, he could barely walk due to back surgery and had to be helped to the ring by linking arms with his tag partner Davey Boy Smith. He was knocked out by Jimmy Hart's megaphone early in the match, avoiding his having to wrestle in the match for story purposes.
He was involved in a real-life backstage fight with Jacques Rougeau and the Bulldogs wrestled their last WWF match at the 1988 Survivor Series. He made many enemies during his time in the WWF including Brutus Beefcake because he refused an autograph for Betley who was visiting his old student backstage at a 1986 WWF show, The Honky Tonk Man whom Dynamite claimed had made light of injuries suffered by his friend Harley Race, - an account largely corroborated by Hart - and Jacques Rougeau. Rougeau blamed Dynamite for cutting up his clothes for a prank (which was actually committed by Curt Hennig) and Dynamite in return had confronted and punched Rougeau and his brother Raymond, he ambushed and assaulted Billington with three shots in the face while his fist was loaded with a roll of quarters (including one in the mouth that knocked out four of Dynamite's teeth). Many wrestlers thought he deserved the beating because of Billington's history of bullying. He was known for being a legitimately tough guy and for his stiffness as a worker. Mick Foley told a story of when Kid and Smith wrestled the team of Les Thornton and a young Mick Foley. He said that Billington had manhandled him so badly in the ring that he could not eat solid food for a time, and Billington had tore a ligament in Foley's jaw with his trademark Hook Clothesline move. WWF-champion Randy Savage once specifically asked for Billington to watch his back when he went drinking in a hotel bar which was frequented by NWA wrestlers, including Ric Flair.
The Bulldogs returned to Stampede Wrestling and won the International Tag Team Titles after leaving the WWF. They also competed in All-Japan Pro Wrestling where they were paid $20,000 each by Giant Baba. Davey Boy Smith left to return to the WWF and fabricated a story to the All-Japan office that Billington was in a serious car accident and was unable to compete. Since Davey Boy Smith had trademarked the term "The British Bulldog" during the Bulldogs' previous run in WWF, he decided to return to the WWF under the ring name The British Bulldog, and would send people to the United Kingdom to warn the promoter every time a flyer was distributed which promoted Dynamite Kid as a "British Bulldog". Billington announced his retirement on December 6, 1991 due to years of steroid abuse (which included an incident where he used horse steroids), working a high impact style, and cocaine usage.
He divorced from his first wife Michelle (the sister of Bret Hart's ex-wife Julie) and moved from Canada back home to Wigan, England with his parents. He embarked on another All-Japan tour and visited Dan Spivey where he stayed in his home in Florida for a week. When Spivey came back from vacation, he and Billington took hits of LSD, which resulted in Billington coming close to death twice in one day, but he was revived with adrenaline shots by paramedics both times.
He had his final match on October 10, 1996, at a Michinoku Pro event called "These Days" where he teamed with Dos Caras and Kuniaki Kobayashi against The Great Sasuke, Mil Máscaras, and his greatest rival, Tiger Mask. Billington's body was clearly degenerated to the point where he was practically skin and bones, as the bottom portion of his tights were very loose. In the end, Dynamite delivered his trademark tombstone piledriver on Great Sasuke which lead to Dos Caras powerbombing Sasuke for the pin fall. When he was at the airport to return home the next day, he had a second seizure (as the first one was in 1987, while traveling with the Ultimate Warrior) and was sent to the hospital immediately.
Because of a large amount of back and leg injuries he suffered during his career, he is disabled and uses a wheelchair. He was told he would never walk again. The inventor of the diving headbutt Harley Race, has stated that he regrets ever inventing the move because of the fact that it appears to cause spinal problems, and may have contributed to Billington's disability. Billington also has suffered from heart problems. On November 23, 2013 it was reported that Billington suffered a stroke.

Motivation

Motivation is an important part of human psychology. Motivation makes a person want to work towards a goal. It makes people want to take action. For example, hunger is a motivation which causes a desire to eat. Motivation is the purpose or psychological cause of an action. 
With animals, motivation is caused by basic needs. These needs can be the needs for food, water, warmth, safety, mating, protecting the young, defending territory, or needs to escape pain and threats. The drive to do these things is instinctive, inborn, and triggered by the situation an animal is in. 
Compared to other animals, motivation in humans is more complicated. Like other animals, humans also have the instinct to find food and water and avoid pain. However, humans are also capable of having long-term plans that require motivation over a long period of time. 
A drive or desire is "a deficiency or need that activates behaviour aimed at a goal or an incentive".<ref name=Drive/Desire></ref> 
Drives may arise inside or outside an organism. External drives for humans are rewards and punishments, and can be quite subtle: a frown or a smile may be sufficient for a young person.
Drives often occur "within" the individual and may not need external stimuli to encourage the behaviour. An example is the sexual drive which is driven by our hormone system. The desire for sex is wired deep into the brain of all human beings as glands secrete hormones that travel through the blood to the brain and stimulates the onset of sexual desire. The process is started by the brain's hypothalamus, which releases pulses of GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). This starts a whole chain of reactions which we call "puberty". Longer term, the hormone supporting male sex drive is testosterone, and for women testosterone and oestrogen.
By contrast, outside rewards and stimuli are used in training animals by giving them treats when they perform a trick correctly. The treat motivates the animals to perform the trick consistently, even later when the treat is removed from the process. Children are motivated to learn by approval of friendly adults, and by their own pleasure at success.
Motivation and emotion are intertwined: "Emotional states tend to have motivational properties".
Not all motivated behaviour is the result of conscious decisions. Freudian psychology suggests that much behaviour is motivated by "unconscious factors, working through a network of defence mechanisms, symbolic disguises and psychological cloaks".

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), or Luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), is a hormone synthesized and released from neurons in the hypothalamus.
GnRH is responsible for the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary. 
GnRH activity is very low during childhood, and is activated at puberty or adolescence. During the reproductive years, pulse activity is critical for successful reproductive function as controlled by feedback loops. However, once a pregnancy is established, GnRH activity is not required.

Dyspraxia is a chronic disability that affects coordination. It is also known as developmental coordination disorder. 2-6% of people have dyspraxia. Four times as many males than females have it. It is sometimes called 'clumsy child syndrome', but adults have it too. People with dyspraxia (Dyspraxics) may have other disabilities such as ADHD or autism. 
There is no single cause of dyspraxia. It may not be diagnosed until later in childhood or sometimes teenage years. It cannot be cured: people who have it will live with it for life, however people are able to overcome it and find alternative ways to accomplish tasks which may usually be difficult without support. 
People who have developmental coordination disorder may also have one or more of these conditions:

Pippi Longstocking

Pippi Longstocking () is a fictional character who originally appeared in a series of children's books by Swedish author Astrid Lindgren. The character has since adapted into several movies and television series. Pippi means "quirky" in old Swedish slang. She was named by Lindgren's daughter Karin, who was nine years old at the time. She had asked for a story from her mother one day when she was home sick from school.
Pippi is an unusual and spirited nine-year-old girl. She has superhuman strength, and is easily able to lift her horse with one hand. She often mocks and tricks adults she encounters; she usually reserves her worst behaviour for the most condescending adults. Pippi only really gets angry when someone treats her horse badly. Like Peter Pan, Pippi does not want to grow up. She is the daughter of a pirate captain and has adventurous tales to tell. She has four best friends: her horse, a monkey, and the neighbour's children Tommy and Annika.
The first three Pippi Longstocking books were published by Rabén and Sjögren from 1945 to 1948. Another series of six books were published between 1969 and 1975. Two final stories were printed in 1979 and 2000. The books have been translated into 64 languages.
There are three full-length Pippi Longstocking books:
There were three original picture books that were translated into English:
There are many picture books and short books based on parts of chapters from the original three, including:
The first movie about Pippi Longstocking was filmed in 1949. The movie was based on three of the books, but several storylines were changed and characters were removed and added. Pippi's character was played by Viveca Serlachius. It was directed by Per Gunvall and released on October 20, 1950.
An American movie version from Columbia Pictures was released in 1988. It was called "The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking", although it actually just retold the original story. The movie was directed by British director Ken Annakin. It starring Tami Erin as Pippi with Eileen Brennan, Dennis Dugan, John Schuck and Dick Van Patten in supporting roles.
In 1961, the NBC children's television series "Shirley Temple's Storybook" showed an episode about Pippi Longstocking. It was the 15th episode in the show's 2nd season. The 60-minute episode first aired on 8 January 1961. The episode is historically important. It was the first time a child played Pippi in a television or movie adaptation, the first American television or movie adaptation of the book, and the first television or movie adaptation of the book in color.
The episode stars (among others) child actor Gina Gillespie as Pippi Longstocking, Renie Riano as schoolteacher Miss Lindquist, and Tor Johnson as circus strongman Mighty Adolf. Pippi defeats bullies and burglars, and out-performs a circus strongman. The episode has been released to DVD.
A Swedish television series, "Pippi Longstocking", was created in 1968. The stories were based on the books. The first episode was broadcast on Sveriges Radio TV in February 1969. It was a co-production between Sweden and West Germany. Several German actors had roles in the series. Inger Nilsson played Pippi.
Astrid Lindgren had been unhappy with the 1949 adaptation. She wrote the script herself for this version. The series was directed by Olle Hellbom who also directed several other Astrid Lindgren adaptations. This version is the most well-known version in Sweden and other European countries.
A television movie version, "Peppi Dlinnyychulok", was released in 1982 by Mosfilm. It was produced by Margaret Mikalan, and starred Mikhail Boyarsky, Lev Durov and Tatiana Vasilieva. Pippi was played by Svetlana Stupak, and her singing voice was provided by Svetlana Stepchenko.
In 1985, Carrie Kei Heim played Pippi in the "ABC Weekend Special" called "Pippi Longstocking". It was directed by Colin Chilvers. It was shown in two parts: on November 2 and November 9.

Black Eye galaxy

The Black Eye Galaxy (or Sleeping Beauty Galaxy; Messier 64, M64, or NGC 4826) was discovered in 1779. It is a fairly close galaxy, just over 24 million light years away.
It has a spectacular dark band of absorbing dust in front of its bright nucleus. This is why it is called the "Black Eye" or "Evil Eye" galaxy. M64 is well known among amateur astronomers because it can be seen in small telescopes. It is a spiral galaxy in the Coma Berenices constellation.
The gas in the outer areas of M64 rotates in the opposite direction to the gas and stars in the inner areas. The inner area has a radius of only about 3,000 light-years, while the outer area extends another 40,000 light-years Many new stars are near the edges between the two areas.
Astronomers think the oppositely rotating gas happened when M64 took in a galaxy that collided with it. This happened over a billion years ago. New stars are forming in the shear region. The shear region is where the oppositely rotating gases collide, are pushed together, and get smaller. 
The image shows hot, blue young stars that have just been made. There are pink clouds of glowing hydrogen gas that fluoresces when exposed to ultraviolet light from newly made stars. The small galaxy that collided with M64 has now been almost completely destroyed. Its stars are either in the main galaxy or scattered into intergalactic space. The motion of gas at the outer edge of M64 is a sign of the ancient collision.

Centaurus A

Centaurus A or NGC 5128 is a prominent galaxy in the constellation of Centaurus. It was discovered in 1826 by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop at his home in New South Wales, Australia. 
NGC 5128 is either a Hubble type lenticular galaxy or a elliptical galaxy. It is 1016 million light-years away.
NGC 5128 is one of the closest radio galaxies to Earth. Its active center has been well studied. The galaxy is the fifth brightest in the sky, and is an ideal amateur astronomy target. The galaxy is only visible from low northern latitudes and the southern hemisphere.
Spitzer Space Telescope studies have confirmed that Centaurus A is colliding with, and devouring, a smaller spiral galaxy. Like other starburst galaxies, the collision produced the intense burst of star formation. 
The center of the galaxy has a supermassive black hole. Its mass is about 55 million solar masses. This ejects a relativistic jet with emissions in the X-ray and radio wavelengths. Astronomers have taken radio observations of the jet ten years apart. They found that the inner parts of the jet are moving at about half the speed of light. X-rays are produced further out as the jet collides with surrounding gas. This produces highly energetic particles. The radio jets of Centaurus A are over a million light years long.

Marble Arch

Marble Arch is a white Carrara marble monument which is on a large traffic island. It is at the junction of Oxford Street, Park Lane, and Edgware Road, almost directly opposite Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park in the City of Westminster, London. 
Historically, only members of the royal family and the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, have been allowed to pass through the arch in ceremonial procession.
The name "Marble Arch" today usually refers to the area in West London where the arch is, at the southern end of Edgware Road. There is also a Marble Arch underground station nearby.
Until 1851 it stood in front of Buckingham Palace. The arch was designed in 1825 by John Nash as a ceremonial entrance to the courtyard of the new Buckingham Palace. He was rebuilding the palace from the former Buckingham House. The palace, as designed by Nash, was laid out around three sides of the courtyard, with the Marble Arch placed on its open eastern side.

Yard

The Yard (abbreviation yd, plural sometimes yds) is a unit of length in the Imperial System and United States Customary Units.
The word "yard" comes from the Anglo-Saxon word for a straight rod.
A yard has always been 3 feet, although the length of a foot has changed frequently throughout history. In 1959, the International Yard and Pound Agreement was signed between the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, the United States, New Zealand and Canada. It was defined as 0.9144 metres. The United States continued to use the old yard under the name 'Survey Yard'
Roadsigns in the United States and the United Kingdom are in miles and yards, rarely in Canada and the Republic of Ireland. It can also be used as a measure of area (square yard) and as a measure of volume (cubic yard). It is also used to measure pitches and fields for a number of sports that originated from English speaking countries. It finds seldom use in other metricated Commonwealth Nations.

National Art Museum of Azerbaijan

National Art Museum of Azerbaijan () is the biggest art museum of Azerbaijan. It was founded in 1936 in Baku and in 1943 was named after Rustam Mustafayev, a famous Azerbaijani theater stage designer and theater artist. The museum's total collection includes over 15,000 artworks. There are over 3,000 items in 60 rooms on permanent display. About 12,000 items are kept in storage. The museum often changes the temporary displays so that more of these stored artworks can be displayed for a short time. The museum is made up of two buildings standing next to each other.
Seven of the rooms in the first building show European art, and ten rooms show Russian art. European art includes artworks of Italian (Guercino, Leandro Bassano, Francesco Solimena, Lorenzo Bartolini), French (Jules Dupré, Gaspard Dughet, Pascal Dagnan-Bouveret, Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant), Dutch/Flemish (Frans Hals, Michiel Jansz van Mierevelt, Adriaen Brouwer, Adriaen van Ostade, Justus Sustermans, Pieter Claesz), German (Johann Heinrich Roos, Fritz August Kaulbach) and Polish (Jan Styka) painters.
The second building built in 1885 houses Eastern art, represented particularly by Persian, Turkish, Chinese and Japanese art. Russian art is represented notably by paintings of Karl Briullov, Alexey Venetsianov, Vasily Vereshchagin, Isaac Levitan, Vladimir Makovsky, Valentin Serov, Vladimir Borovikovsky, Vasily Tropinin, Konstantin Korovin and Ivan Shishkin. There are also restored artworks of Russian avant-garde.
Among Azerbaijani artists represented are painters Mir Mohsun Navvab, Bahruz Kangarli, Tair Salakhov, Azim Azimzade, Salam Salamzade, Vidadi Narimanbekov, Mikail Abdullayev, Togrul Narimanbekov and sculptor Omar Eldarov. The works of Sattar Bahlulzade fill one entire room. 
The museum also holds easel and book miniatures of 17th-19th centuries, lacquered (varnished) miniatures of 18th-19th centuries and collection of sherbet spoons, made from mulberry tree.
The first works were acquired from Saint-Petersburg, Moscow and private collections. The museum expositions were later shown in Canada (1966), Cuba (1967), Syria (1968), France (1969), former Czechoslovakia, Algeria (both 1970), Iraq (1971) etc. The museum is open Tuesday to Sunday from 10:00 until 18:00.

Antonino Rocca

Antonino Rocca (born Antonino Biasetton, April 13, 1927 – March 15, 1977) was an Italian professional wrestler.
He was trained by professional wrestler Stanislaus Zbyszko in Argentina. During his professional wrestling career, he was known for his unique, acrobatic, off-the-ground, flying wrestling style.
Rocca was responsible for the revival of the New York City Metropolitan-Area territory in the late 1940s which would eventually become part of the modern World Wrestling Entertainment. Rocca would become one of the most well-known wrestlers in America during the golden age of television and had an uninterrupted seven-year run of headlining or co-headlining every main-event at the Garden. Aside from singles competition, Rocca had a successful tag team career with Miguel Pérez. Both Rocca and Pérez were known for drawing huge crowds to Madison Square Garden on a regular basis.
During the early 1950s, he held two regionally-recognized versions of professional-wrestling's world heavyweight singles-championship while he still headlined nationwide which was frequently in territories where other wrestlers were the recognized champs. In 1949, he competed for the New York City-area territory owned by Joseph Raymond "Toots" Mondt and the Johnston family of promoters and was considered to be the box-office draw that helped bring wrestling back to Madison Square Garden, on a regular basis, for the first time since 1938. In 1957, during a match against Dick the Bruiser, a riot erupted at Madison Square Garden when Rocca busted open Dick the Bruiser.
He formed a successful tag team with Jose Miguel Perez in 1957. They won the NWA Capitol World Tag Team Championship and were never defeated after winning the title but it was abandoned after around five years. During 1959 and 1960, he briefly worked with Kola Kwariani and Jack Pfefer, who took effective control of the Garden's wrestling office. Rocca set the post-World War II record for wrestling-attendance at Madison Square Garden's 49th–50th Street location, drawing 21,950 fans in a singles-match against "the Amazing Zuma," a/k/a "Argentina Zuma," on January 2, 1960, as was reported by the New York Times.
After he was demoted, and because of the arrival of Buddy Rogers as the featured star at MSG in 1961, he left the WWWF and briefly set up a competing promotion (which was supported by Jim Crockett, Sr. and others) based at the Sunnyside arena in Queens, NY but it was believed to have failed and it shut down. During the mid-1970s, he teamed up with Vince McMahon to handle the color commentary on the WWWF's weekly television show. On February 25, 1977, he made an appearance with World Wide Wrestling Federation and officiated a boxing match between Gorilla Monsoon and André the Giant at the famed Madison Square Garden.
Rocca died on March 15, 1977, at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City after suffering complications following an infection. In 1995, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Kevin Nash.

Monster movie

A monster movie (also called a creature feature or giant monster movie) is a movie with humans trying to stay alive in attacks by very large monsters. Monster movies can fit in the horror, fantasy, or science fiction genres. In Japan, large monsters are called kaiju.
In many monster movies, the monster is created by humans because of something such as a bad experiment, the effects of radiation, or the destruction of habitat. Since the 1953 movie "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms", many monster movies have shown the monster being created by nuclear warfare. One of the most well-known movie monsters, Godzilla, was created by a nuclear weapon. Godzilla has appeared in 28 movies and has become a cultural icon in Japan.

The movie was the first movie to show a monster being woken up or created by an explosion from an atomic bomb. Its success helped cause the creation of more monster movies in the 1950s such as "Godzilla".
An atomic bomb test in the Arctic Circle wakes up a sleeping dinosaur, the fictional "Rhedosaurus". After being woken up, it destroys New York City before being killed at Coney Island.

A Sit-ski is a sled used by a skier with paraplegia, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, or cerebral palsy. It is made from fiberglass. Early sit-skis looked like kayaks and had metal edges.
Sit-skis are used for para-Nordic skiing and para-alpine skiing. If the sit-ski has one ski, it is sometimes name a mono-ski. If a sit-ski has two skis, it is sometimes called a bi-ski. Skiers first used bi-skis in para-alpine skiing before using mono-skis. Mono-skis allow skiers to ski using the same way that people who stand ski down a hill.
Sit-ski users use outrigger skis. In para-Nordic skiing, a sit-skier may use a normal ski pole that is not as long as one people standing up to ski would use.
When skiers first learn to ski, their teacher may be connected to them on a tether until the skier can control the sit-ski on their own.

People first used mono-skis in 1985 in the United States. Mono-skis allow skiers to ski using the same way that people who stand ski down a hill.
Mono-skis have a hydraulic lift. This makes it easier for a skier to get in and out of the mono-ski.

UDFj-39546284 is a 'stellar structure' (probably a galaxy) reported January 27, 2011 as light from the oldest object. It was detected through infrared observation by the Hubble Space Telescope. It was reported in December 2012 to be at redshift z = 11.9 using Hubble and Spitzer telescope data, including Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF).
The actual stellar source of the light detected no longer exists. The image is likely to correspond to a compact mini-galaxy of blue stars that existed as we see it 13.42 billion years ago, around "380 million years" after the Big Bang (estimated at 13.8 billion years ago).
At the time of the announcement, it was the oldest galaxy found. It beat the previous distance record holder by about 150 million light years. With the revision of the distance, it again became the oldest galaxy found as of December 12, 2012. The next attempt to see further will be the James Webb Space Telescope launched sometime this decade. 
Unlike UDFy-38135539, UDFj-39546284 has not been spectroscopically confirmed. A galaxy first formed near to the end of the Dark Ages, it offers information from early after the Big Bang.

Fluorescence

Fluorescence is the light given off by certain substances when it absorbs light or other electromagnetic radiation. First the substance absorbs the energy, then it emits light. When the light source is removed, the fluorescence stops occurring. It is a form of luminescence. 
In most cases, the light given off has a longer wavelength and lower energy than the absorbed light.
One of the most surprising types of fluorescence is when a substance absorbs ultraviolet light that cannot be seen by the human eye, but gives off visible light.
Fluorescence is used in many fields such as mineralogy, gemology, chemical sensors (fluorescence spectroscopy), dyes, biological detectors, and fluorescent lights.
Fluorescence in the life sciences is a way of tracking biological molecules. A protein or other component can have a fluorescent dye attached to it, which allows a scientist to visually find the specific protein with a microscope.

Greyfriars Bobby was a Skye terrier. He belonged to a policeman in Edinburgh named John Gray. When Mr. Gray died in 1858, he was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard. Bobby stayed near the grave of Mr. Gray long after the funeral. He would not leave. 
The little dog came to be called Greyfriars Bobby. He stayed at the grave for the rest of his life. Bobby died in 1872. He was buried just inside the gates of the kirkyard. His grave is marked by a small pink granite stone. Bobby's collar and bowl are displayed in the Museum of Edinburgh.
In 1873, Lady Angela Burdett-Coutts erected a drinking fountain "(pictured)" in Edinburgh to the memory of Greyfriars Bobby. The bronze statue of Bobby on top of the fountain was made by William Brodie. The fountain and statue have long been favourites of Scots. 
The fountain is near the George IV Bridge in Edinburgh. The statue of Bobby sits on top of a column of granite. At the bottom, there is an eight-sided drinking basin for dogs. Near the top, there is a drinking spout for people. In 1957, the water was turned off because of health concerns. 
Eleanor Atkinson wrote a book about Bobby in 1912. It has never been out of print. A movie based on the book was made in 1961. This movie stars Tam O'Shanter as Bobby, and is described as "a tearjerker, one that saddens and lifts the spirit at the same time."

Luminescence can be caused by chemical reactions, electrical energy, subatomic motions, or piezoelectricity (stress on a crystal). The term 'luminescence' was introduced in 1888 by Eilhard Wiedemann.
The dials, hands, scales and signs of aviation and navigational instruments and markings are often coated with luminescent materials in a process known as 'luminising'.

<doc id="415817" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=415817" title="Victim blaming">
Victim blaming

Victim blaming is holding the victim of a crime responsible for that crime. Starting in the 1970s, the term was commonly used in the United States. It was mainly used in connection with trials for rape, as well those with a racist background.
In 1947 Theodor W. Adorno defined what would be later called "blaming the victim," as "one of the most sinister features of the Fascist character".
Shortly after, Adorno and three other professors at the University of California, Berkeley created their influential and highly debated "F-scale" (F for fascist), published in "The Authoritarian Personality" (1950), which included among the fascist traits of the scale the "contempt for everything discriminated against or weak." A common example of victim blaming is the "asking for it" idiom, e.g. "she was asking for it" said of a victim of violence or sexual assault.
Roy Baumeister, a social and personality psychologist, argued that blaming the victim is not always wrong. According to him, it can lead to new ideas that show that the victim was at least partly responsible for the act. Baumeister argues that the common explanations of violence and cruelty are not helpful because they say that the victim was innocent. According to him, in the classic telling of "the myth of pure evil," the innocent, well-meaning victims are going about their business when they are suddenly assaulted by terrible villains. The situation, however, is not this simple; In most cases, the victim has done something to either anger the offender, or to help the offender's actions. In spite of this, the actions that follow may be more important than the "victim's" first offense.
In 2005, Australian Muslim preacher Feiz Mohammad gave a speech in Australia in which he blamed women for being rape victims. He said: "A victim of rape every minute somewhere in the world. Why? No one to blame but herself. She displayed her beauty to the entire world... Strapless, backless, sleeveless, showing their legs, nothing but satanic skirts, slit skirts, translucent blouses, miniskirts, tight jeans: all this to tease man and appeal to his carnal [sexual] nature.
In a case that became famous in 2011, an eleven-year-old victim of repeated gang rapes in Cleveland, Texas, was accused by the defense attorney of sexually attracting men on purpose so that they would try to rape her. "Like the spider and the fly. Wasn't she saying, 'Come into my parlor, said the spider to the fly?' ", he asked a witness.

Ambroise Vollard

Ambroise Vollard (3 July 1866 – 21 July 1939) was one of the most important dealers in French modern art at end-19th and early twentieth century. He had his portrait painted by so many artists that Picasso said "The most beautiful woman who ever lived has never had her portrait painted, drawn, or engraved any oftener than Vollard".
In most cases he bought art directly from the painters of his day. He was the first owner of Cézanne's "Vue sur l'Estaque et le Chateau d'If". This sold at Christie's in London for £13,522,500 in February 1015.
He sold these almost unknown artists, who became world-famous. They included Paul Cézanne, Aristide Maillol, Renoir, Louis Valtat, Pablo Picasso, André Derain, Georges Rouault, Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh. He was also an avid art collector and publisher. 
After graduation, Vollard became a collector-dealer in art. In 1893, he started his own art gallery, at Rue Laffitte, then the center of the Parisian market for modern art. There Vollard put on his first major exhibition: Manet and others were followed by Gauguin and Van Gogh (4 – 30 June 1895). 
Not attractive in appearance, he was a very shrewd businessman who made a fortune. In 1930 Vollard commissioned Picasso to produce a suite of 100 etchings which became known as the "Vollard Suite".
Vollard would later write biographies of Cézanne (1914), Degas, and Renoir, as well as the charming "Recollections of a Picture Dealer" (1936). Vollard was killed in July 1939, at the age of 73, on his way to Paris, when his chauffer-driven car skidded off the road. 
News of his death prompted this letter from one artist to another:
Vollard died without direct heirs. Much of the art was left to extended family and close friends, although a significant number of works apparently were sold, dispersed, or disappeared during World War II.
More than 80 years after his death, works from his collection were sold after agreement with the various claimants to his estate. Massive auctions were held by Sotheby's in Paris and London in June 2010.

Pulp fiction is a kind of literature. It gets its name from the cheap, wood pulp paper it was printed on. Pulp fiction covered several genres: romance, western, science fiction, horror, detective, adventure, etc. It was most popular in the United States during the 1920s–1940s. Publication then decreased, perhaps because television took over the evening hours for readers and magazines were not read as often. Pulp fiction was published in a cheap magazine format often with gaudy covers. Stories were sometimes serialized, meaning the reader had to buy each monthly issue over a period of time to complete a particular story.

The Japanese occupation of Hong Kong (Chinese: ) was a time when Japan controlled Hong Kong. It began when the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Mark Young, gave up the British Crown colony of Hong Kong to Empire of Japan on 25 December 1941. The occupation lasted for three years and eight months until Japan gave up at the end of Second World War.
One day after the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong started, the Japanese military yen was changed to the only legal currency of Hong Kong. In January 1942, two Hong Kong dollars could be converted to one Japanese military yen. However, in July, four Hong Kong dollars were needed to be converted to one Japanese military yen.
All primary schools and secondary schools had to teach Japanese. They were not allowed to teach English.

Parking lot

A parking lot (or car park) is an area where cars and other vehicles are parked and left temporarily. They are usually flat. The surface is usually made of asphalt, concrete, or gravel. Some lots may be bare earth. The paving material in a parking lot can heat quickly in the sun. A parked car can get hot, too. Children, older people, and animals such as dogs and cats should not be left in a parked car. They can die in a hot car.
Lines are put on paved lots to create the outlines of parking spaces. People leave their cars in these spaces while they go shopping, go to work, or do errands. Some spaces are set aside for disabled drivers or disabled passengers. These spaces are clearly marked. A disabled driver needs a special badge or insignia issued by the government to use these spaces. Disabled spaces are usually close to the front of a lot. Drivers who are not disabled can be fined or their cars towed if they use these spaces. 
Parking lots are usually near businesses, hospitals, government buildings, schools, zoos, etc. If many people go to these places, then the parking lots will be large. If not too many people go to these places, then the parking lots will be small. Small lots are usually unsupervised. Large lots are usually supervised by an attendant stationed in a small booth at the lot's entrance. He may issue a pass to a vehicle's driver that is stamped with the vehicle's arrival time. He will collect a fee from the driver when the vehicle leaves the lot.
At a rural event such as a county fair, concert, auction, barn sale, corn maze, or pick-your-own strawberry patch, a parking lot may be nothing more than a large area of bare earth or a meadow that has been mowed for parking. Ropes or bales of hay may be used to mark the area for parking. An attendant may or may not be present. If present, he or she will advise a driver where to park in the lot and may or may not collect a fee. 
Parking lots can be dangerous, especially at night. Some lots are poorly supervised and dimly lit. Persons intent on mischief such as tire-slashers or criminal activity such as prostitutes, burglars, thieves, rapists, and drug dealers can operate without being easily seen. Anything valuable such as money, weapons, packages, children, or animals should "never" be left alone in a parked car. These will tempt thieves and child or animal snatchers. 
Broken glass, rusty nails, potholes, and rats can be parking lot hazards to people and their vehicles.

"The Great Redwall Feast" is a story about the creatures of Redwall preparing for a feast while Matthias the Warriormouse, Constance the Badger , Foremole, and the Abbot are traveling in Mossflower Woods looking for a mysterious Bobbatan Weary Nod. The book shows the Abbeydwellers bustling in Redwall, cooking, gathering flowers, and doing other things for the feast for their beloved Abbot (probably Abbot Mordalfus).

Biceps

The biceps brachii is a muscle in the arm. It has two parts, a long part and a short part. Using the elbow the muscle helps the movement of the forearm. When the muscle shortens, it bends the elbow and twists the forearm so that the palm faces up. The two parts of the muscle start on different parts of the shoulder blade and end together on the forearm.
The biceps is also a muscle in other quadrupeds. In humans, the muscle is more complex, and allows more complex movement than in other quadrupeds. 
The word biceps literally means two-headed, and refers to the fact that the muscle attaches to two different parts of the shoulder. In quadrupeds, the muscle only attaches at one point of the shoulder.

Altenbrunslar

Altenbunslar is one of the sixteen villages that form the town of Felsberg in Schwalm-Eder-Kreis, North Hesse, Germany. The nearest city is Kassel.
Approximately 306 people live in the village.
The village is on the eastern bank of the Eder River. To the east of the village is the "Quillerwald" (English: "Quiller Forest") or "Markwald" (English: "common forest"). This forest once belonged to all the villages around it. The people of the villages were allowed to cut down trees and to let animals feed there, but they were not allowed to hunt in the forest. The Eder River meets the Fulda River just 9 km (5.6 mi) upstream from Altenbrunslar at Edermünde.
The bedrock is made up of differently-coloured sandstones. The hilly landscape is formed by way that the sandstone wears down evenly. Some steep hills are the remains of volcanoes. The volcanoes were active in this area about 15-20 million years ago.
3000 years before the birth of Christ, the area was inhabited by a prehistoric people.
The name "Bruneslar" was first recorded in 1154. The name "Altenbrunslar" was first used in 1381. It was owned by a local knight.
In 1532 Altenbrunslar received a monk from a nearby monastery.
In the Middle Ages Altenbrunslar belonged to the town of Felsberg. This later became part of Napoleon's Kingdom of Westphalia and then it became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. On 1 February 1971, Altenbrunslar joined Neuenbrunslar to become the "Brunslar Community". This in turn became part of the town of Felsberg on 1 January 1974.
A railway was constructed through the village in 1848. In 1849 Altenbrunslar received a railway station. On 3 September 1849 the first train came through Altenbrunslar, pulled by a locomotive called "Hassia".
In the Second World War the Allies destroyed Edersee Dam on the night of 16-17 May 1943. A big flood wave hit the village half an hour later. The people of the village heard the news on the radio and ran into the forest. The water flooded the Eder valley. The bridge in Altenbrunslar was not knocked down by the water.
The first stone bridge over the Eder River at Altenbrunslar was built in 1885. Before this there was a wooden bridge in summer and a ferryman with a boat in winter.
The small chapel in Altenbrunslar is a protected building. It was built in the 10th Century. In 1861 a wooden second storey was built on the chapel. In 2000, the chapel was completely renovated. The villagers believe that the church bell came from the nearby village of Brechelsdorf. Brechelsdorf is a nearby village that was destroyed many years ago.
Altenbrunslar was the "Dolles Dorf" (English: great village) in the Hessischer Rundfunk television programme of the same name. A ten-minute film about the village was first shown on 25 August 2012. It can be seen still on the "Dolles Dorf" HR website.

<doc id="416070" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=416070" title="Mercia">
Mercia

Mercia was one of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of the Heptarchy. It was in the region now known as the English Midlands. Mercia was centered on the valley of the River Trent and its tributaries. Settled by Angles, their name is the root of the name 'England'. Their neighbors included other Angles, Saxons and all from Germany. Mercia bordered on Northumbria, Wessex, Sussex, Essex and East Anglia. To the west were Britons in Powys and the kingdoms of southern Wales.
Archaeological discoveries show the first settlements were in the Trent river valley. The original kingdom of Mercia had a variety of different kinds of land. Most of it would not have been the first choice of anyone wishing to settle there. Not if better land was available elsewhere. The name 'Mercia' comes from the tribal name "Mierce", which means 'boundary folk.' It was probably a name already known in the English midlands and was adopted by the Angles who settled there. The Angles, according to Bede, came from "Angulus" in northern Germany. They were of the same stock as the East Anglians and the Northumbrians. The invasion of England by the Germanic tribes was relatively quick. By England was a large collection of small kingdoms each having a warlord or petty king. Within 200 years of their arrival in England, the late seventh century, emerged the Heptarchy: the seven kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England. Mercia was the dominant power among the Anglo-Saxons from the middle of the seventh century to the early ninth century. Several Mercian noblewomen played an important role in Mercian affairs. This is in contrast to Wessex where women rarely had an active role in the government. During the seventh and eighth centuries Mercia struggled mainly with Northumbria. By the ninth century Wessex was the dominant power in the region. King Egbert of Wessex (802–839) was the overlord and for the first time passed this position down to his heirs. From this time on until they ceased to exist as a kingdom, Mercia was a vassal kingdom to Wessex. In the last quarter of the ninth century Mercia lost much of its territory in the midlands to Danish settlers.
Christianity was introduced into Mercia in the 650s. The first monks were Irish followed by Northumbrians. By 653 a single was established and a series of Irish trained bishops followed. In 674 a second diocese was established for eastern Mercia.
Penda (–655) was a pagan king of Mercia. He was able to put together a of a number of smaller kingdoms and from that he created Mercia. But in the 630s he was not able to compete with the larger Anglo-Saxon kingdoms that were around his. Northumberland was threatening to expand into the territory of Mercia. Penda found it convenient to ally with Gwynedd, the dominant British kingdom to the west. It was an unusual cooperation between Christians and pagans, but it worked. Together they defeated the Northumbrian king, Edwin, who died at the battle of Hatfield Chase.
Athelred I (675–716) was the third of Penda's sons to be king of Mercia. He ravaged Kent to prevent them from breaking away from his rule. In 679 he was at war with Northumbria. According to Bede, Theodore Archbishop of Canterbury between the two kings to restore peace. He married Ostryth, daughter of the king of Bernicia. He was a Christian king who founded several churches and monasteries. He stepped down as king in 704 and passed the crown to his nephew Cenred. He was of the monastery of Bardsey and appears to have died about 716.
Offa (757–796), was the first of the Anglo-Saxon kings who might rightly be called "king of the English". He was the son of Thingfrith, the brother of Penda. He struggled to gain control of Mercia having come to power just after a civil war. But he proved to be ruthless, bold and creative in bringing Kent, Sussex and Essex under his control. Offa had diplomatic relations with Charlemagne. He was one of the few Anglo-Saxon monarchs to have dealings with continental rulers. Letters and presents were exchanged. But when Offa sought a marriage of his son to one of Charlemagne's daughters, relations were quickly cut off. Frankish ports were closed to British ships. Offa, very involved in church affairs, presided over church councils personally in 786-7. In 787 he convinced the pope to create the position of archbishop of Lichfield in Mercia. He wanted his own archbishop who was closer at hand than the Archbishop of Canterbury. He reorganized the of his kingdom. One of these defenses, Offa's Dyke was a massive earthworks between Mercia and the Welsh kingdoms to the west. Offa died in 796. His son, Ecgfrith, lasted only 141 days as king. Mercia was never again as powerful as it was during Offa's reign.
A Mercian king who had just taken the throne, Raedwulf, was killed by Viking raiders in 844. In 855 Viking bands were recorded as being in Mercia in the vicinity of Wrekin. But the year 865 saw a major change in activity by the Scandinavian invaders. This was a much larger military force than had been seen before. The arrival of the Great Heathen Army in East Anglia. For a time the Danes (Vikings) were more interested in Northumbria. They gained control of York and moved south into Mercia then made their winter camp in Nottingham. In the spring of 868 a combined Mercian and West Saxon army came against the Vikings, but there was no battle. The Mercian king Burghred concluded a peace treaty with the invaders, who then moved north to York. In 873 Burghred was forced out of Mercia by the Vikings who then set their own choice of King, Ceowulf. In 874 the heathen army split with Halfdan, on of the leaders taking his band north. In 878 the Vikings in Mercia were attacked and defeated by King Alfred of Wessex. They converted to Christianity and settled on the land in East Anglia.
The ninth century saw the decline of Mercia as a kingdom. In 873-74 Mercia was conquered by the heathen army. In the 880s Wessex formed a marriage alliance with Mercia. Alfred's daughter, Ethelflaeda, married Ethelstan (II), of Mercia. When Ethelstan died, in 912, Edward the Elder appointed Ethelflaeda (his sister) 'Lady of the Mercians.' When Ethelflaeda died in 918, the Mercian nobles now thought themselves free of Wessex rule. Edward stepped in and appointed Ethelflaeda's daughter, Aelfwynn, to rule Mercia as his representative. But in 919 Edward brought her back to Wessex. After that Mercia was considered just another shire under his rule. A series of (similar to a count in Europe) followed. Under Canute in 1017, Mercia became one of the four divisions of England.

Ski pole

Ski poles are carried by skiers to help them not falling over. They are called "ski sticks" in the United Kingdom. In France, they are called "batons". 
Ski poles in alpine skiing are shorter than ski poles in Nordic skiing. Longer ski poles are used in cross country and free style skiing.
They are made from metal or composite material.
Ski poles have been used for a long time. People first used one ski pole when skiing. The first ski poles could also be used as a weapon. A flat circle was put near the bottom of the ski pole in the 17th century. This made it so the ski pole would not go all the way down to the ground. People started to use two ski poles by the start of World War I.
A steel ski pole was first made in 1937. It was invented by Otto Lang. Before this, some people used bamboo for ski poles. More and more people started using metal ski poles after World War II.
Lots of changes were made to ski poles from 1950 to 1975.

<doc id="416118" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=416118" title="Galapagos shark">
Galapagos shark

The Galapagos shark ("Carcharhinus galapagensis") is a species of Requiem shark, in the order of Carcharhiniformes. The Galapagos shark is a large species, reaching a maximum length of up to 12.1 feet (3.8 metres), and weighing up to 86 kg. This species is found in tropical waters surrounding oceanic islands, and is found in the Pacific, Atlantic, and western Indian Ocean.
The Galapagos shark was originally described as "Carcharias galapagensis" by Robert Evans Snodgrass and Edmund Heller in 1905, and was later moved to the genus "Carcharhinus". The holotype was a 64 cm (2.13 feet) long fetus from the Galapagos Islands, giving it the specific name "galapagensis".
Garrick (1982) placed the Galapagos shark and the Dusky shark at the center of the "obscurus group", one of two major groupings within "Carcharhinus". The group consisted of the Bignose shark, the Caribbean reef shark, the Sandbar shark, the Dusky shark, and the Oceanic whitetip shark; all large, triangular-toothed sharks. Based on allozyme data, Naylor (1992) changed this group, with the additions of the Silky shark, and the Blue shark. The closest relatives of the Galapagos shark were found to be the Dusky shark, the Oceanic whitetip shark, and the Blue shark. 
The Galapagos shark reaches a maximum length of 12.1 feet (3.8 metres). Male individuals mature at lengths of 6.9-7.5 feet (2.1-2.3 metres), while females mature at 7.2-8.2 feet (2.2-2.5 metres) in length. The maximum weight for this species is 86 kg. 
The Galapagos shark is a large shark with a slim, fusiform body, and a low inter-dorsal ridge between the first and second dorsal fin. The first dorsal fin is tall and nearly straight. The long pelvic fins are straight, each with a pointed tip. The snout of the Galapagos shark is widely rounded.
The Galapagos shark resembles the Grey reef shark, but can be distinguished by its more slender body, and by the slightly rounded tip on the first dorsal fin. The Galapagos shark also strongly resembles the Dusky shark, but has a much more straighter first dorsal fin, and it has larger teeth than the Dusky shark. However, this can be difficult to distinguish without direct comparison of the two species. The Galapagos shark has a brownish-grey upper body, and a white belly. A white stripe can sometimes be seen on the sides of the shark. Their pectoral fins are solid grey with slightly dusky tips. 
The Galapagos shark is circumtropical in distribution with a preference for waters surrounding oceanic islands. In the Atlantic Ocean, this shark is found at St. Paul's Rocks, Ascension Island, Cape Verde, Saint Helena, São Tomé, Bermuda, and the Virgin Islands. In the western Indian Ocean it is found off Walter's Shoal, south of Madagascar. In the Pacific Ocean, the Galapagos shark is found off Lord Howe Island, Tuamoto Archipelago, Middleton and Elizabeth Reefs, Hawaii, Revillagigedo Islands, Clipperton Island, Cocos Island, and Galápagos Islands. Distribution limits are not well defined due to confusion with similar species of sharks. 
The Galapagos shark is a common, but habitat-limited, tropical shark found inshore as well as offshore, near insular and continental shelves, between 39°N-33°S, at depths up to 180 metres. This species prefers clear water with coral and rocky bottoms. Although it is a coastal-pelagic species, it is capable of crossing considerable distances of open ocean between islands, and has been reported at least 50 km from land. Young Galapagos sharks are found in shallow waters of 25 metres or less. 
The Galapagos shark is known to be a solitary species, but it is sometimes found in loose groups. It is a curious species, and is known to approach swimmers and investigate other disturbances in the water, such as boats and divers. The Galapagos shark can be an aggressive animal, and, like other species of sharks, it performs a display in order to attack its target. This display involves arching its back, raising its head, and lowering its pectoral fins as it swims with a noticeable twisting motion. 
The Galapagos shark usually hunts near the bottom, feeding on bottom-dwelling fish, but it is also been known to feed on prey from the surface. The fish it preys on include eels, flatheads, groupers, flatfish, and triggerfish. It also feeds on squid and octopuses. In the Galápagos Islands, off the coast of Ecuador, the Galapagos shark has been observed to feed on sea lions and marine iguanas. Occasionally, a large Galapagos shark may feed on other sharks. 
Galapagos sharks are viviparous, or livebearing, with embryos nourished by a yolksac-placenta during gestation. Mating and birth occurs early in the year within Hawaiian waters. Female individuals often have mating scars from males biting the gills, fins, and body. Each litter contains 6 to 16 pups, each being 60-80 cm long. The pups stay in shallow waters to avoid predation and cannibalism from members of their own species, eventually moving out to deeper waters as they mature. Galapagos sharks do not reproduce until the age of 10 years, with the maximum known lifespan for a Galapagos shark being approximately 24 years. 
According to the International Shark Attack File, the Galapagos shark has been responsible for one fatal attack on a swimmer in the Virgin Islands. In locations where this shark is common, they often are attracted to divers, sometimes even becoming an obstacle. When divers take aggressive actions, these sharks are not discouraged, but instead become more excited. The Galapagos shark has been reported to display threat behaviors including arching of the back, raising the head, and lowering the caudal and pectoral fins while swimming in a twisted, rolling motion.
This species is considered potentially dangerous and may attack if a food source is present, such as during spearfishing activities. If there are large numbers of Galapagos sharks present, it would be wise to limit one's activities in the water. 
The Galapagos shark is currently listed as Near Threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, the Galapagos shark might be listed as Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered in the near future. In Australia and the western Pacific Ocean, the Galapagos shark is considered "Data Deficient" due to a lack of information on populations in this region. However, there is a marine reserve that surrounds this species' range off Lord Howe Island and the Kermadec Islands (New Zealand), where it is not considered to be under threat.

In "The Phantom Menace", Padmé is the fourteen-year-old queen of the planet Naboo. In the movie, Amidala gets captured by the evil Trade Federation, meets the young slave boy Anakin Skywalker, and takes her captured planet back from the Trade Federation.
In "Attack of the Clones", Padmé is not the queen anymore; she is now an adult, and a Senator. She and Anakin Skywalker fall in love. Even though Anakin is a Jedi, and Jedi aren't supposed to get married, Padmé and Anakin marry anyway.
"Revenge of the Sith" is the last movie Padmé is in. She is going to have a baby, and her husband Anakin dreams that Padmé will die when she has the baby. Palpatine, a man that Anakin trusts, tells Anakin that he can save Padmé with the evil Dark Side of the Force. So Anakin goes to the Dark Side. He goes to a lava planet called Mustafar, and his master Obi-Wan Kenobi, along with Padmé, follow him there. Anakin, who is completely evil because of the Dark Side, thinks that Padmé had gotten Obi-Wan to come with her (she hadn't). Anakin chokes Padmé using the Force and she blacks out.
Padmé is taken a little later to a hospital, where she gives birth to twins. Soon afterwards, she dies, telling Obi-Wan with her last breath that she knows there's still good in Anakin.

Battle of Buxar

The Battle of Buxar was fought on 23 October 1764 between the forces of the British East India Company led by Hector Munro and the combined army of Mughal rulers.
The Mughal forces were drawn from three princely states, whose rulers were Mir Qasim, the Nawab of Bengal, Shuja-ud-Daulah the Nawab of Awadh, and the Mughal King Shah Alam II.
The battle fought at Buxar, then within the territory of Bengal, a town located on the bank of the Ganges river about 130 km west of Patna, was a decisive victory for the British East India Company.
The combined Mughal forces numbered about 40,000 men, and Monroe's forces numbered about 10,000 men, of whom 7,000 were regular British Army men seconded to the East India Company. Reports of the battle say that lack of co-ordination between the various Mughal forces was the main reason for their defeat.
The fate of the three defeated Mughal leaders varied. Shah Allam was forced to pay a fine of five million rupees. After negotiation, the Treaty of Allahabad was signed. All his pre-war possessions were returned except for the districts of Karra and Allahabad. He became a pensioner, with a monthly pension of 450,000 rupees. The Company later restored Allahabad to him. The Company got revenue authority (Diwani rights) for almost 100,000 acres of land in the modern states of West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, as well as in the neighbouring areas of Bengal.In return mughal emperor was given 26 lakh rupees.The Company's main aim was not to rule India, but to make money. Taxes were collected for them by a Company-appointed deputy-nawab.nawab was to pay an indemnity of rupees 50 lakh 
Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula was restored to Oudh, with a subsidiary force and a guarantee of defence. Mir Qasim, the Nawab of Bengal, was ruined by the defeat. He had been the prime mover in the war, but afterwards he was deposed by the Company and rejected by Shuja-ud-Daula.
These arrangements made the British East India Company the virtual ruler of Bengal, since it already possessed decisive military power. All that was left to the Nawab was the control of the judicial administration. But he was later forced to hand this over to the Company in 1793. Thus the company's control was virtually complete.
In spite of all this the East India Company was again on the verge of bankruptcy, which stirred the British to make a fresh effort at reform. On the one hand Warren Hastings was appointed with a mandate for reform; on the other an appeal was made to the British state for a loan. The result was the beginnings of state control of the Company, and Warren Hastings was appointed Governor-General of Bengal from 1772 to 1785.

Technical writing is communication about technical and occupational fields. The Society for Technical Communication (STC) defines technical writing as any form of communication that is: 
The audience is a vital part of the writing. If, say, writing medical instructions to help patients and care-providers, the writing might be for doctors & nurses; lay people with a good general education; or poorly-educated people. The writing would be quite different in each case. For example:
Technical writing communicates visually as well as verbally. A communication should follow an overall logic. One approach is descriptive, such as "Parts of a car engine". Another is the problem-solver: "How to change tyres". Practical encyclopedias usually inform and have how to do it sections. Medical encyclopedias are a good example. A medical encyclopedia provides information to readers about health questions.
People have always needed how-to guides, which appeared in manuscripts before the arrival of print.

Multi-instrumentalist

A multi-instrumentalist is a musician who plays two or more musical instruments. Many professional musicians aim to become multi-instrumentalists.
In an orchestra, a number of musicians might each play a variety of different instruments during a single performance. Orchestras will also often, but not always, ask for several members of the woodwind section to be multi-instrumentalists. This is sometimes referred to as doubling. Typically, for example, one flute player in the orchestra will switch to playing the piccolo or alto flute when called to by the score. If an orchestra is playing a piece that needs "two flutes and a third flute doubling piccolo", it means that the third flautist also has a piccolo. Sometimes he or she will need to put the flute down and play the piccolo, then perhaps swap round again.
An oboist may sometimes double on the cor anglais, a clarinettist may sometimes double on a bass clarinet, and a bassoonist may double on a contrabassoon. At other times such instruments may need a separate player. At the beginning of a musical score there should be a list of instruments that makes it clear how many players are needed.

There is a school there that trains people to be botanists respecting biodiversity. There is a zoo in the Jardin that was started during the French Revolution from the animals at Versailles. The garden was started in 1626. It was used in 1640 to grow medicinal herbs for the king. Among directors, Comte de Buffon expanded it greatly. Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck, Chair of Botany, changed its name from "Jardin du Roi" to "Jardin des Plantes" during the French Revolution. It helped not to have the name linked to the king.

The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) is part of the British Cabinet Office. It supervises the intelligence organisations of the United Kingdom on behalf of the Cabinet. More generally, it advises to the Cabinet on security, defence and foreign affairs.
The JIC sets priorities for the three intelligence and security agencies: MI6, MI5, GCHQ), as well as Defence Intelligence.
The Committee is chaired by a permanent chairman, a member of the Senior Civil Service, who is supported by the Intelligence and Security Secretariat and an assessment staff. The assessment staff is made up of experienced senior analysts drawn from across government and the military and conducts all-source analysis on subjects of interest to the committee. JIC papers written by the staff draw input from across the intelligence and security agencies and other related bodies.
Membership comprises the heads of the three collection agencies—the Secret Intelligence Service, Security Service and GCHQ—the Chief of Defence Intelligence, Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence Staff, the Chief of the Assessment Staff, representatives of the Ministry of Defence, Foreign and Commonwealth Office and other departments, and the Prime Minister's adviser on foreign affairs.
The JIC has three functions:
The JIC drafts the annual Requirements and Priorities for collection and analysis, for approval by Ministers. These support the strategic national security objectives of the UK:
The JIC was founded in 1936 as a sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, the advisory peacetime defence planning agency. During World War II, it became the senior intelligence assessment body in the UK. In 1957 the JIC moved to the Cabinet Office, where its assessments staff prepare draft intelligence assessments for the committee to consider.
Ever since World War II, the chief of the London station of the United States Central Intelligence Agency has attended the JIC's weekly meetings. One former US intelligence officer has described this as the "highlight of the job" for the London CIA chief. Resident intelligence chiefs from Australia, Canada, and New Zealand may attend when certain issues are discussed.

George A. Miller

George Armitrage Miller (February 3, 1920 – July 22, 2012) was one of the founders ofhe cognitive psychology in the 20th century. He studied thinking, language, and memory.
Miller found out that if you ask people to remember a list of words or numbers, most people can remember only between five and nine words or numbers. His paper "The magical number seven, plus or minus two" explained this as a limitation in human sohrt-term memory.
Once a behaviorist, Miller moved to cognitive psychology. In 1991, Miller was awarded the National Medal of Science. Miller revolutionized the world of psychology by showing that aspects of the human mind could be observed and tested in a laboratory setting.
Miller was born in Charleston, West Virginia. In 1940 he received his bachelor's degree from the University of Alabama, where he majored in English and speech. In 1946, Miller received his Ph.D. in Psychology from Harvard University. During his life, he taught as a professor at Princeton, Harvard, and Rockefeller University. He died in Plainsboro, New Jersey at the age of 92.
The first concept introduced by Miller is known as chunking. "Chunking" is a way developed to help people remember a certain number of words or numbers. It is known to help with both short-term memory and long-term memory. When he asked subjects to perform memory tasks in various experiments, he noticed that most subjects recalled about seven units from a list regardless of the list topic. Miller said that the short-term memory could only hold 5-9 chunks of information (plus or minus two) and is also a way to increase the capacity of short term memory. A chunk can refer to digits, words, faces, or any type of meaningful unit. Chunking is when a person groups multiple words together to help with memory tasks. This technique can help people with recalling specific groups of words. Remembering is much easier when the chunking technique is used. An example of chunking would be trying to remember a long sequence of digits. For example, 2 4 5 6 1 4 2 7 0 could be remembered by chunking those numbers into smaller meaningful units such as 245 614 270.
"The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing information" was a paper published originally in "The Psychology Review". This paper remains Miller's most famous and cited piece of work in the history of psychology. It outlines the number of items, numbers, or objects an average human memory can hold. Miller states in his paper, "This number assumes a variety of disguises, being sometimes a little larger and sometimes a little smaller than usual, but never changing so much as to be unrecognizable" (Miller 1956). He did a series of memory tasks that led him to believe that 7 was the number. The paper goes into depth stating how the memory span is a complicated source and how it can hold a lot of information.
Miller began working on Wordnet in the mid 1980s. It is a large database of English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs that are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms which represent a specific concept or idea. It resembles a thesaurus since it groups words together based on their meanings. Miller wanted to use Wordnet as a tool to test psycholinguistic theories on how people use and understand words.

GRU

GRU ("Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye") is the military intelligence service of the Russian Federation, (formerly the Red Army of the Soviet Union). 
"GRU" is the English version of the Russian acronym ГРУ, which means Main Intelligence Directorate. 
The GRU is Russia's largest foreign intelligence agency. In 1997 it had six times as many agents in foreign countries as the SVR (The SVR is the successor to the KGB's foreign operations directorate). The GRU commanded 25,000 Spetsnaz troops in 1997.
The GRU's first predecessor in post-tsarist Russia was created on October 21, 1918 under the sponsorship of Leon Trotsky, who was then the civilian overseer of the Red Army. It was originally known as the Registration Directorate ("Registrupravlenie", or RU). In his history of the early years of the GRU, Raymond W. Leonard writes:
"As originally established, the Registration Department was not directly subordinate to the General Staff [of] the Red Army... In 1921... it was elevated in status to become the Second (Intelligence) Directorate of the Red Army Staff.
It was given the task of handling all military intelligence, particularly the collection of intelligence of military or political significance from sources outside the Soviet Union. The GRU operated residencies all over the world. They ran with the SIGINT (signals intelligence) in Cuba, and throughout the former Soviet bloc countries, especially in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.
The GRU was well known in the Soviet government for its fierce independence from the rival "internal intelligence organizations", such as NKVD and KGB. At the time of the GRU's creation, Lenin infuriated the Cheka (predecessor of the KGB) by ordering it not to interfere with the GRU's operations. Nonetheless, the Cheka infiltrated the GRU in 1919. This planted the seed for a fierce rivalry between the two agencies, which were both engaged in espionage. The rivalry was even more intense than that between the FBI and CIA.
The existence of the GRU was not publicized during the Soviet era. Documents about it became available in the West in the late 1920s, and it was mentioned in the 1931 memoirs of the first OGPU defector, Georges Agabekov. Walter Krivitsky, the most senior Red Army intelligence officer ever to defect, described it in detail in his 1939 autobiography ("I was Stalin's agent"). 
It became widely known in Russia, and the West during perestroika. "Viktor Suvorov" (Vladimir Rezun), a GRU agent who defected to Great Britain in 1978, wrote about his experiences in the Soviet military and intelligence services. According to Suvorov, even the General Secretary of the CPSU could not enter GRU headquarters without going through a security screening.
The GRU is still a very important part of the Russian Federation's intelligence services, especially since it was never split up like the KGB. The KGB was dissolved after aiding a failed coup in 1991 against the then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. It has since been divided into the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) and the Federal Security Service (FSB).

Mobility aid

Mobility aids (or orthopedic aids) are devices that are designed to help people walk or move better. They can make people hurt less and feel less pain. An example is a wheelchair.
There are two types of orthopedic aids. One type means people can move part of the body less. The other type means people put less weight on their feet. Splints, knee braces, shoe adjustments, position aids and abduction casts are orthopedic aids.
Children with a disability are two times more likely children who do not have a disability to use an orthopedic aid.

Athelred of Wessex

Athelred or Æthelred (–) was King of Wessex from 865 to 871. He succeeded his brother Ethelbert at the time of the invasion of England by the Great Heathen Army. He was the first of the four sons of Athelwulf not to rule as before he became king of Wessex.
Athelred was the fourth son of King Athelwulf and his wife Osburga. She was the daughter of Oslac, Athelwulf's butler. While his father was in Rome and France, 855-856, his oldest brother Athelstan had died. Prior to his death two years later Athelwulf left a will. in that will the two eldest sons, Ethelbald and Ethelbert should have the kingdom. When Ethelbald died in 860, Ethelbert became the king of Wessex. But their father's will had made no provision for Athelred and Alfred, the two youngest sons, to be kings. Possibly for that reason Ethelbert did not appoint his brother Athelred King of Kent. He consolidated everything into the single kingdom of Wessex. In 865 Vikings raided into Kent and the men of Kent agreed to pay them ransom. But the Vikings the eastern part of Kent despite the pending treaty.
Athelred had not expected to reign, but when his brother Ethelbert died in 866, Athelred became the king of Wessex. This was just after the arrival of the Great Heathen Army in East Anglia. For a time they were more interested in Northumbria. They gained control of York and moved south into Mercia then made their winter camp in Nottingham.
It was at this time his younger brother Alfred was given the title of "Secundarius" (Latin for secondary). This meant he was appointed as heir to the throne. In 868 Burgred, the King of Mercia, asked King Ethelred and Alfred for their help against the Danes (Vikings). When the Danes saw the combined English army against them they asked for peace. The Vikings withdrew to York where they managed a completely defeat. The next year, 871, the great Viking army grew much larger. They moved on Reading. Ethelred with his brother Alfred arrived with their army to meet the new threat. In the battle that followed, the Battle of Reading, both sides suffered many casualties. Athelred's army was defeated. Four days later the two armies met again at the Battle of Ashdown. This time the West Saxons won the victory and the Vikings retreated to Reading. Two weeks later Athelred and Alfred led the West Saxons against the Danes at Basing where the Danes won. Two months passed without any fighting between them. The next battle was at a place called Merantun. After a day long battle which the English were winning, the Danes were able to regain their lost ground. Just after mid-April in 871, 
Athelred died. He was buried at Wimborne Minster. He was succeeded by his younger brother Alfred.
His wife's name is not known (see note a below). He had two sons:

Granary

A granary is a building or room (usually in a barn) that holds grain. It keeps the grain dry so it does not spoil, and keeps it away from animals that would eat it. They are an important part of a farm. If the grain is lost, eaten by pests, or ruined, the farmers might starve or lose much money. 
Granaries have been around as long as humans have had agriculture and in some cases even before we planted crops. The earliest ones are over 11,000 years old and stored grains that grew in the wild and were collected by hand. 
Granaries are still used today.
Granaries usually have few, if any, windows. They are often built off the ground, to keep out water and mice. They will have a door near the bottom to get the grain out, and usually have an opening up high to put the grain in.

Silo

A silo is a building that holds silage. Silage is green chopped plants (usually grass or corn stalks) that is kept wet (this is different than hay, which is stored dry). It ferments and can be kept all winter. It makes good food for livestock, particularly dairy cows. 
The silo is a fairly recent part of the farmyard. It was first widely used in the late 1800's. They are still used today.
While silage can be stored in many ways, the typical silo is a tall cylinder. It usually has a cone or dome cap on top. There is an opening at the top to put silage in, and doors running down one side to take it out. Originally a farmer would climb the outside of the silo to the top of the silage, go inside, and shovel out the silage. There is typically a chute on the outside, and the silage would fall down the chute, where it could be gathered and fed to the cows. Now there is machinery that does that job.

Centre for Conflict and Peace Studies

The Centre for Conflict and Peace Studies (abbreviated CAPS) is an independent research organization, which started in July 2006. Its office is in Kabul, Afghanistan. This office is a research centre, which means that it is an important place where people can do independent research.
Most of CAPS' research is about governance, security, and developmental challenges (difficulties) in Afghanistan. 
Most research centres in Afghanistan have foreign - non-Afghan - workers, but the people who work at CAPS are from Afghanistan. CAPS is a place where people can discuss ways to change Afghanistan. The workers from CAPS tell other Afghan people about their research. They also discuss their research with people from other countries. When people from other countries come to Afghanistan to work, they can learn how to live in Afghanistan from CAPS.

Cheka

The Cheka was the first Soviet state security organization. It was created on 20 December 1917, after a decree issued by Vladimir Lenin. Its first leader aristocrat-turned-communist Felix Dzerzhinsky. 
By late 1918, hundreds of Cheka committees had been created in the cities. Many thousands of dissidents, deserters, or other people were arrested, tortured or executed by Cheka groups. After 1922, Cheka groups underwent many reorganizations, as did the NKVD. Its members were called Chekists well into the late 1980s. With Vladimir Putin's rise to power, the reference to the FSB members as "Chekists" arose, particularly by Putin's political opponents, often with negative connotations.
From its start, the Cheka was an important military and security arm of the Bolshevik communist government. In 1921 the troops of the Cheka numbered 200,000. These troops policed and ran the Gulag system; "requisitioned" food; tortured and executed political opponents; put down rebellions and riots by workers or peasants, and mutinies in the desertion-plagued Red Army.
The full name of the Cheka in 1918 was (in Russian) the "All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution, Profiteering and Corruption".
A member of Cheka was called a "chekist" throughout the Soviet period, despite various official name changes. The term is still found in use in Russia today. For example, President Vladimir Putin has been referred to in the Russian media as a "chekist" due to his career in the KGB.

Pedophilia occurs when an individual suffers from extreme altered states obsessiveness in the mind frame of needing to have perfection, flawless, innocence. This starts with self appearance. People suffering this condition pick at their flaws out the outside and undergo a variety of plastic surgery to achieve the look they prefer. Also, people who suffer from this disorder may be deemed as mentally ill. These people will stop at nothing to obtain perfection.Pedophilia is also linked to the unnatural attraction to children. Some pedophiles try to use children to fill their obsession, crave and desire because they know inside they are unnatural and want to feel like they have more power. Acts of illicit nature are illegal. Pedophiles interested in children are sent to state mental hospitals or prisons.

Semper Fidelis

"Semper Fidelis" is the official march of the United States Marine Corps. It was written by John Philip Sousa in 1888. The words Semper Fidelis mean "Always Faithful" in Latin.
Sousa became conductor of the United States Marine Corps band in 1880. He had some success with his earliest works like "The Gladiator" (1886), but his first big hit with the public was "Semper Fidelis". 
This march is sometimes thought to be the prototype for American marches. Until "Semper Fidelis", American marches had taken European marches as their models. It was "the first musical composition to receive the official recognition of the United States government." "Semper Fidelis" is the only march authorized for a service by Congress. The USMC uses it for the Pass in Review during Change of Command Ceremonies, as well as Public Parades. It was played along the parade route for Bill Clinton's second inauguration. The march has an AaBbCcDd form. Its meter is 6/8. Other marches by Sousa are "The Stars and Stripes Forever" and "The Washington Post".

Lesse

The Lesse (Walloon: Aiwe di Lesse) is a river in the Ardennes, in the Walloon region of Belgium. It is a right tributary to the river Meuse.
The Lesse is long. It flows roughly in a northwestern direction. Its source is near Libramont-Chevigny, in the Belgian province of Luxembourg. The mean discharge for Anseremme between 1995 and 2004 was 19.0 m.
The watershed of the Lesse Basin, with an area of , has about . With only 62,500 people living there, it is the least densely populated of all small watersheds of Walloon region.
Part of the watershed of the Lesse is on limestone where there are some karstic phenomena. Near Han-sur-Lesse (commune of Rochefort), by the "Gouffre de Belvaux", the entire river goes underground, flowing through limestone caves.
The Lesse flows into the river Meuse in the town of Anseremme, commune of Dinant, Namur province.
From its source to its mouth, the main tributaries of the Lesse are:
The valley of the Lesse and this part of the Ardennes are covered with forests. The area surrounding the caves is the National Park Lesse et Lomme. On the mountains along the lower part of the river there are several castles. The route of the former railway line from Houyet to Rochefort is used as a hiking and cycling trail.
Many of the caves along the banks of the Lesse are important archaeological sites - these include the Trou de Chaleux (by the Cirque de Chaleux), and the Trou des Nutons and Trou du Frontal at Furfooz.
It is possible to go down the Lesse in kayak or canoe from Houyet to Anseremme.

Orinoco

The Orinoco is a main river in northern South America. It is one of the longest rivers in South America, at . Its drainage basin, sometimes called the Orinoquia, covers , with 76.3% of it in Venezuela and the rest in Colombia. The Orinoco and its tributaries are the main transport system for eastern and interior Venezuela and the llanos of Colombia. 
The Orinoco Basin is also ecologically important. It is the only habitat of the Orinoco crocodile. This is one of the rarest reptiles in the world, with fewer than 250 living in the wild. It is also home to Amazon river dolphins.
The mouth of the Orinoco was recorded by Christopher Columbus on 1 August 1498. Its source, however, was first explored by non-native people in 1951, 453 years later. It was explored by a French and Venezuelan team. 
The delta, and tributaries in the eastern llanos such as the Apure and Meta, were explored in the 16th century. They were explored by German expeditions under Ambrosius Ehinger and his successors. Alexander von Humboldt explored the basin in 1800. He reported on the river dolphins, and wrote extensively about the plants and animals he found.
The course of the Orinoco forms a wide arc that surrounds the Guiana Shield. The source of the river is at Cerro Delgado-Chalbaud, in the Parima Mountains. This is on the border between Venezuela and Brazil, at high (). The river can be divided into four stretches:
At its mouth, the Orinoco forms a wide delta that branches off into hundreds of rivers and waterways. They flow through of swampy forests. At its widest, this delta is about large and at its widest. In the rainy season, the Orinoco can swell to a breadth of and a depth of .
Off the coast of the delta is Trinidad and Tobago, which is separated from the mainland by the Columbus Channel.
Most of the important rivers in Venezuela are tributaries of the Orinoco. The largest are the Caroní, which joins it at Puerto Ordaz. The river is actually connected to the Amazon River through the Casiquiare canal. This is a distributary of the Orinoco, flowing into the Rio Negro and then the Amazon. This connection forms a natural canal between Orinoco and Amazon.
Boats can travel on the river for most of its length. Ocean ships can travel as far as Ciudad Bolívar, upstream. River steamers carry cargo as far as Puerto Ayacucho.
There is a rich iron ore deposit in the Orinoco delta. It was found in 1926, south of the town of San Felix on a mountain named "El Florero". Mining there began after World War II. At the start in the early 1950s, about 10,000 tons of soil with ore in it was being mined each day.
There are also tar sands in the Orinoco Belt, which may be a source of future oil production.

Stock footage

Stock footage (also called archive footage, library pictures, and file footage) is movie or video footage that can be used in other movies. This type of footage is not made by the person who makes the movie. Instead, the footage has already been shot by another person and is being used by the person who is making the movie. People who make movies use stock footage because it's less expensive to use stock footage than it is to shoot new footage. A piece of stock footage is called a "stock shot" or a "library shot". Examples of stock footage that might be used include video of cities and landmarks, animals in their habitats, and historical footage. Many websites such as YouTube allow people to view or download stock footage.

<doc id="416858" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=416858" title="Battle of New Orleans">
Battle of New Orleans

The Battle of New Orleans was the last battle fought in the War of 1812 between the British and the Americans. It involved a series of smaller battles leading up to the main engagement on January 8, 1815. The British had 8,000 infantry in the line out of a total strength of 11,000. The British force was commanded by General Edward Pakenham. The Americans were under the command of General Andrew Jackson. The battle took place at the Plains of Chalmette a few miles from New Orleans.
After the 1793 Treaty of Paris, which officially ended the American Revolutionary War, the British were still present on the American continent. They were trading with the Indians and at times were inciting them against the Americans. The British were blockading American ships, capturing American seamen and forcing them into the Royal Navy to fight against Napoleon. On June 18, 1812, President Madison signed the formal declaration of war against Britain. The fighting began in Canada in an attempt to cut off the British supply lines. At that same time, the British were fighting Napoleon but when that war ended these skilled troops were sent to Canada. The Americans did not have a standing army as such and was still composed of individual militias, men who signed up for short periods of time. By 1813, the British had won nearly every major battle in the war. In August 24, 1814 The British entered Washington D.C., and burned the Capitol to the ground.
On December 24, 1814 the Treaty of Ghent was signed ending the War of 1812. The treaty called for returning all borders and lands as they were before the war. Because of the distances involved and the delay in communications, at the time of the battles neither side knew a peace treaty had been signed.
As the Ghent negotiations suggested, the real causes of the war of 1812, were not merely commerce and neutral rights. They were also the issues of US western expansion, relations with American Indians, and control of the
territory of North America.
The British fleet of some 30 warships sailed out of Negril Bay, Jamaica on 26 November, 1814. The fleet under command of Admiral Cochrane moved into the Gulf of Mexico ready to attack New Orleans. Cochrane's fleet was transporting 14,450 British troops who had recently been fighting in the Napoleonic wars in France and Spain. The first the Americans learned of this was through the leader of the Baratarian pirates, Jean Lafitte. The British had offered him several thousand dollars if he would join them. They wanted him to guide them through the swamps in and around New Orleans. Asking for time to consider, Lafitte contacted the American governor of Louisiana, Claiborne and told him of their plans. Claiborne contacted General Andrew Jackson. At first the Americans were wary but they accepted his help. Lafitte offered much needed gunpowder, fuses, cannonballs and the artillery expertise of his men. The pirates knew the swamps around New Orleans and helped guide the Americans to outmaneuver the British.
Andrew Jackson arrived in New Orleans December 2, 1814. He declared martial law and rallied the formerly reluctant citizens to fight the British. Jackson told the people of New Orleans that every citizen was needed to protect the city. He also told them "All those who are not for us are against us". He then blocked all approaches to the City by water.
On December 22 the British moved in barges toward the narrow opening at Lake Borgne. They soon found their way blocked by five American gunboats under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Jones. The British, guided by Spanish and Portuguese fisherman from the area, had an assault force of forty-five boats under the command of Captain Nicholas Lockyer. In the engagement that followed, the British prevailed but suffered about 100 casualties. Lieutenant Thomas Jones lost about 40 killed and wounded. The rest of his men were captured. One man escaped and warned the Americans. The British moved in barges from Lake Borgne to land seven miles below New Orleans on the Mississippi river. Their fishermen guides landed them at Villere Plantation.
When Jackson learned of the landing at Villere Plantation he immediately planned an attack that night. The British general Keene had about 1,900 men when he landed at Villere. More British soldiers landed and by evening there were about 2,300 at the plantation. Under cover of darkness the Americans surprised the British in their camp. Over 2,100 Americans began firing on the British, many of whom were still being landed in boats. The American schooner, "Carolina", had anchored in the Mississippi near the plantation and opened a murderous fire on the British camp. Even after the Americans withdrew the "Carolina" kept up the bombardment until it was blown up by Heated shot and sunk on December 27th. The battle had no clear winner, but the British were delayed in their attempt to capture New Orleans. The Americans lost about 200 men while the British losses were fixed at about 300.
After the battle Jackson began building his defenses at the Rodriguez Canal. This was an abandoned millrace approximately 20 feet wide and 3 to 5 feet deep. It was in a swampy area which gave the Americans a clear advantage. The defensive mill earthworks blocked the British approach to New Orleans. They could only attack from the front as the swamps and river protected the flank. The American position was two miles from the British camp and about five miles below New Orleans. A body of mounted American riflemen kept track of all British movements.
On 25 December General Pakenham landed at the Villere Plantation and took charge of all British forces. The British began moving on 27 December but encountered the American earthworks and halted.
The British were surprised to see the American earthworks. Apparently they had not thought enough of the Americans to even keep an eye on them. In addition to the fortifications in front of them the American cutter "Louisiana" was anchored in the river. As soon as the British appeared the guns of the Americans drove them back. But undaunted they began construction of their own earthworks and setting up their artillery positions.
The British brought up guns from their ships and built earthworks for them under cover of darkness. This was to counter the American guns mounted on their earthworks as well as those on the anchored cutter in the river. On the morning of 1 January 1815 the British opened up with their artillery and rockets. The surprised Americans quickly returned fire but with greater accuracy. Jackson’s line lost two of their guns in the exchange but one by one the cannon fire from the American line took out all fourteen of the British guns. By noon the British had been driven back from their artillery emplacements and the artillery duel was over for the present. Both the Americans and British had placed artillery on the opposite bank of the Mississippi and those batteries exchanged fire most of the afternoon. At night Jackson’s backwoodsmen kept shooting sentries, driving back the pickets and gave the British camp no peace.
Early on the morning of 8 January the British attacked General Jackson’s earthworks. General Packenham’s infantry numbered about 8,000 out of a total force of 11,000. He moved his columns forward while it was still dark to get close to the Americans without being seen. But the element of surprise was lost when a junior officer forgot to bring scaling ladders. When he returned with the ladders it was too late, the Americans could see them. The brigade under the command of General Gibbs attacked the left and center of Jackson’s line. But the American artillery tore large holes in the British line. A regiment of highlanders was sent to help Gibbs but suffered tremendous casualties under the American rifle and musket fire. The British second in command, General Gibbs, was killed on the battlefield. General Pakenham, the overall commander, was shot and killed as he rallied his soldiers. The third in command of British forces, General Lambert, finally called off the assault. The British lost 2,057 men while the Americans lost only 71. The British were veterans of the Napoleonic War and were well experienced and fought bravely but could not break the American defense system.
Fort St. Philip was located on the east bank of the Mississippi river. It protected New Orleans from any river approach to the city. The Americans took over the fort, originally built by the Spanish, in 1808. It was rebuilt with bricks and had two facing the river. The bastions were where most of the fort's twenty guns were mounted. The fort was attacked at the same time General Pakenham led his infantry attack on Jackson's earthworks. The fort was by five British warships for over a week. Finally, on 18 January 1815 the British fleet withdrew. They were damaged but had been unable to do much damage to the fort.
As the gunships retreated on January 18th the British soldiers were recalled to their transport ships. They were required to leave eighteen badly wounded men, two of whom were officers. In their haste they left fourteen artillery pieces and a large quantity of cannon shot. One of the two medical personnel left to take care of the British wounded gave General Jackson a letter from General Lambert. In his letter Lambert stated he had given up all further operations against New Orleans. He asked too that his men be protected and cared for. Jackson had given thought to pursuing the retreating British. But he decided not to risk any of his men's lives needlessly. He thought the lives of ten British soldiers were not worth the loss of one of his own men.
As General Jackson stated in his letter to the Secretary of War, he was not convinced the British had given up on trying to take the Louisiana territory by force. By Jackson's the British had lost over four thousand men either dead, wounded or who had deserted. Jackson left infantry units to guard the earthworks and the Villere plantation should the British return. He brought the rest of his army back to New Orleans on 20 January 1815.

Tlazolteotl

Tlazolteotl (or "Tlaçolteotl") is an Aztec goddess. She is the goddess of purification, steam bath, midwives, sin and adulterers. In Nahuatl, the word "tlazolli" means vice and diseases. Thus, Tlazolteotl was a goddess of filth (sin), vice and sexual misdeeds. However, she was also a purification goddess. Her dual nature is seen in her epithets; "Tlaelquani" ('she who eats filth [sin]') and "Tlazolmiquiztli" ('the death caused by lust'), and Ixcuina or Ixcuinan ('she of two faces'). Her sisters include Tiacapan (the first born), Teicu (the younger sister), Tlaco (the middle sister) and Xocotzin (the youngest sister).
She is the mother of Centeotl and Yum-Kax, the Maya maize god.

<doc id="416888" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=416888" title="Roman house">
Roman house

Roman houses were of several types. Those in Rome were of at least three different types.
Ordinary people lived in apartment blocks called "Insulae", a kind of apartment building. It housed most people of lower- or middle-class status (the plebs) and all but the wealthiest from the upper-middle class (the equites). 
Insulae were of poor quality, but they did have running water and sanitation. Rooms could be owned or rented. They were built in timber, mud brick, and later primitive concrete. They were restricted in height to about 20 metres.
Fires and collapses happened. Among his many business interests, Marcus Licinius Crassus speculated in real estate and owned numerous "insulae" in the city. When one collapsed from poor construction, Cicero said that Crassus was happy that he could charge higher rents for a new building than the collapsed one.
Houses of the rich and upper classes were lavish. The atrium was the most important part of the house. It was where guests were greeted. The atrium was open in the centre, surrounded at least in part by high-ceilinged porticoes that often contained only sparse furnishings to give the effect of a large space. In the centre was a square roof opening in which rainwater could come, draining inwards from the slanted tiled roof. The master's office was placed so that the master could see what was going on. There were kitchens, bedrooms, a dining room, and a number of open rooms.
Servants would use a servants' entrance, not the main entrance. Slaves could not leave the house without the permission of the master. The "domus" was not just a house; it was a place of business as well.
A Roman villa was a Roman country house built for the upper classes. There were two kinds of villas. The "villa urbana", was a country seat in easy reach of Rome (or another city). The "villa rustica" was a farm-house estate, like the later English country house. It was occupied by servants who ran the estate. 
In the Empire, there was a concentration of Imperial villas near the Gulf of Naples, on the Isle of Capri, at Monte Circeo on the coast and at Antium (Anzio). Wealthy Romans escaped the summer heat in the hills round Rome, especially around Frascati (such as Hadrian's Villa). Cicero had at least seven villas. The oldest of these was near Arpinum, which he inherited. Pliny the Younger had three or four, of which the example near Laurentium is the best known from his descriptions.
Large villas were important to the Roman economy. They dominated the Po valley, Campania, and Sicily, and were also found in Gaul. Villas were centres of mining, pottery, or horse raising. Villas specializing in shipping olive oil to Roman legions in Germany were a feature of the southern Iberian province of Hispania Baetica. Some luxurious villas have been excavated in North Africa in Africa Province and Numidia, or Fishbourne Palace in Britannia.

Assemblywomen

Assemblywomen is a satirical comedy by Aristophanes on the idea that women might be better than men at running the state.
The play is about a group of women, and their leader Praxagora. She has decided that the women must convince the men to give them control of Athens, because they could rule it better. The women, in the guise of men, sneak into the assembly and vote the measure, convincing some of the men to vote for it because it is the only thing they have not tried.
The women set up a government in which the state feeds, houses, and generally takes care of every Athenian. They enforce an idea of equality by allowing every man to sleep with every woman, but that the man must sleep with an ugly woman before he may sleep with a beautiful one.
There is a scene in which two men are talking. One of them is going along with the new government, giving his property to the women, and obeying their orders. The other does not wish to give up his property, but he is more than willing to take advantage of the free food.
The following scene has a pair of young lovers unable to make their tryst, as a succession of ever older and more hideous women attempt to and eventually succeed in dragging the man off to make love to him first, as laid down by the new laws.
After the oligarchy put in place after the war fell, Athenians asserted their democracy and equality very strongly. The play makes its point that excessive democracy has its problems.
In the play is what appears to be an exceptionally long word:
Lopado­­temacho­­selacho­­galeo­­kranio­­leipsano­­drim­­hypo­­trimmato­­silphio­­parao­­melito­­katakechy­­meno­­kichl­­epi­­kossypho­­phatto­­perister­­alektryon­­opte­­kephallio­­kigklo­­peleio­­lagoio­­siraio­­baphe­­tragano­­pterygon 
In reality it is a series of words stuck together, not a genuine word. It describes a fictional food dish. Liddell and Scott translate this as "name of a dish compounded of all kinds of dainties, fish, flesh, fowl, and sauces". The Greek word contains 171 letters, which far surpasses that of Shakespeare's 27-letter long word, "honorificabilitudinitatibus" in his Love's Labour's Lost V.I.
It is a transliteration of the Ancient Greek word . It is the longest word to appear in literature.
The dish has at least 16 ingredients, including:

Iron deficiency anemia

Iron-deficiency anemia (or iron-deficiency anaemia) is a common type of anemia. It is caused by not having enough iron in food, not absorbing the iron in food, and/or losing iron because of bleeding.
Iron deficiency causes approximately half of all anemia cases worldwide, and affects women more often than men. This is partly because most women have periods (menstruate). There are probably more than one billion people who have anemia.
Anemia is most common in areas like Brazil or Central Africa. Asia, Central America and Eastern Europe are affected too, with North America least affected.
Symptoms include pale skin, tiredness, and weakness.
Anemia can be diagnosed with a blood test by finding out if there is little enough hemoglobin in the blood.

List of figures in Greek mythology

This is a list of gods, goddesses, people and other figures from Greek mythology. They are sorted into sections below. The immortals include gods (deities), spirits and giants. Being immortal means that they live forever. The mortals include heroes, kings, Amazons and other people. The list does not include creatures.
These figures are described by ancient writers, the oldest of which are Homer and Hesiod. The Greeks created images of their deities for many reasons. A temple would house the statue of a god or goddess, or several deities. The statue might be decorated with relief scenes depicting myths. These were also often painted on pottery and minted on coins.
Roman mythology includes many of the same figures, but uses different names: calling Zeus by the name of Jupiter, and Aphrodite by the name of Venus, for example.
The main and most important gods were the Twelve Olympians. The home of these gods is at the top of Mount Olympus. There was some variation as to which deities were included in the Twelve. As such, the list below numbers fourteen. It includes all those who are commonly named as one of the Twelve in art and poetry. Dionysus was a later addition; in some descriptions, he replaced Hestia. Hades is not usually included among the Olympians, because his home was the underworld. Some writers, however, such as Plato, named him as one of the Twelve.
The primordial deities are the first beings that existed. They are what makes up the universe. All other gods descend from them. The first among them is usually said to be Chaos. Chaos is the nothingness from which all of the others were made. These gods are usually depicted as a place or a realm. Tartarus, for example, is depicted as the deepest pit in the underworld. His brother Erebus is also depicted as a place of darkness, or the emptiness of space. Gaia is depicted as nature or the Earth. Pontus is depicted as the oceans, lakes, and rivers. Chronos is depicted as time.
The Titans are the older kind of gods in Greek mythology. The original Twelve Titans were children of Gaia (Mother Earth) and Uranus (Father Sky). Their leader was Cronus, who overthrew his father Uranus and became ruler of the gods. Cronus' consort was his sister Rhea. Their children were Zeus, Hades, Poseidon, Hera, Demeter and Hestia. Cronus and the Titans were overthrown by Zeus, his youngest son. They fought a war called the Titanomachy. The Titans are depicted in Greek art less often than the Olympians.
The Giants (, "Gigantes") were the children of Gaia. She was fertilised by the blood of Uranus, after Uranus was castrated by his son Cronus. After the Titans' lost their war against the Olympians, Gaia made the Giants rise up against the Olympians to restore the Titans' rule. The Olympians got help from the hero Heracles to stop the Giants. This war was the Gigantomachy.
These deities lived in the underworld. The ruler of the underworld was Hades, who is listed further above under "Olympians".
Seers were prophets, people who were said to be able to see the future or predict events before they happened.

Land bridge

A land bridge is a term in biogeography. It is a narrow land connection between otherwise separate areas, sometimes called an isthmus. 
Its significance is that animals and plants may cross over it when the sea level is lower. They cannot easily cross when the sea level is higher, and water covers the land bridge. The separation of a once connected population often leads to speciation, the splitting of one species into two.
There are several causes which affect whether a land bridge is above or below the water. Plate tectonics may cause the rise or lowering of land. The causes of general sea level changes are not fully understood, but when sea levels fall, shallow sections of continental shelf may get exposed. Sometimes the sea floor rises due to "post-glacial rebound" after an ice age.

Chaperone (protein)

Molecular chaperones are proteins which help large molecules fold or unfold. Some help assemble or take apart other macromolecular structures. They do not occur in these structures when the structures go about their normal functions. 
The first protein to be called a chaperone assists the assembly of nucleosomes from folded histones and DNA. Those assembly chaperones, especially in the nucleus, assemble folded subunits into larger structures such as cell organelles. 
One major function of chaperones is to prevent polypeptide chains and assembled subunits sticking together in clumps which do not function. Some chaperones are "holdases" which act to stop aggregation. Others, called "foldases", do help fold proteins which cannot do it themselves. Such proteins violate Anfinsen's dogma.

Thematic map

A thematic map is a kind of map. Different from normal maps, a thematic map is designed to show the distribution of human or natural features or data. The information may or may not be related to geography. For example, a map which shows population is a thematic map.
Thematic maps are called so because they show features relating to a particular theme or aspect of geography.
An early contributor to thematic mapping in England was the English astronomer Edmond Halley (1656–1742). His first important map was a star chart of the constellations of the Southern Hemisphere, published in 1686. In the same year he also published something new, a map of the globe (Earth) in an article about trade winds. This map is sometimes called the first weather map. 
Another example of early thematic mapping comes from London physician John Snow. Snow’s cholera map of 1854 is the best known example of using thematic maps for analysis of data. His method anticipates the principles of a geographic information system (GIS). He started with an accurate map of a London neighbourhood which included streets and water pump locations. Onto this Snow placed a dot for each cholera death. The pattern centered around one particular pump on Broad Street. At Snow’s request, the handle of the pump was removed, and new cholera cases ceased almost at once. Further investigation of the area revealed the Broad Street pump was near a cesspit under the home of the outbreak's first cholera victim.

Beorhtric of Wessex

Beorhtric (also Brihtric; meaning 'Magnificent ruler') († 802) was the King of Wessex from 786 to 802. He ruled Wessex as a king. His wife and father-in-law exercised most of the power. 
The names of his parents and his ancestry are unknown. In 786, Cynewulf, king of Wessex, was killed by Cyneheard, brother of the former King Sigeberht. Either with help of Offa of Mercia or quickly coming under his influence, Beorhtric became King of Wessex. In 787, he held the Synod of Chelsea jointly with Offa. In 789 he married Eadburh, Offa's daughter. That same year Vikings appeared off the coast of Devon. Believing they were traders the local went to meet them and was killed. This was the first encounter with Vikings in southern England.
After Offa's death in 796, Mercian power over England was weakened. There was a period of three years when some West Saxons tried to break free of Mercian control. But Beorhtric and Cenfulf, the new king, signed a peace treaty. From that time on Wessex remained subordinate to Mercia. Three West Saxon coins have survived from Beorhtric's reign. In style they are very similar to coins struck by Offa. They were probably minted at Southampton after Offa's death.
Queen Eadburh, as Offa's daughter, seems to have held all the power in Wessex. She had a reputation for great cruelty. In later years Asser, a scholar at Alfred the Great's court, recorded the story that Beorhtric had died from being accidentally poisoned by his wife, Eadburh. She fled to a nunnery in Francia, from which she was later ejected after being found with a man. It was a good story but probably more myth than real. But she was the reason Wessex would not have another queen for several generations. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that Beorhtric was buried at Wareham in 802. He left no heirs.

American Airlines Flight 191

American Airlines Flight 191 was a scheduled commercial flight from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago to Los Angeles International Airport. The aircraft used was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10. On May 25, 1979, the aircraft crashed into an open field in Des Plaines, Illinois. All 271 people (258 passengers and 13 crew) on the flight were killed. Two people on the ground were killed and five others were hurt. The crash was caused by the loss of one of the engines, which caused damage to the left wing. The loss of the engine happened because of bad maintenance to the aircraft that had been done eight weeks before the crash. It is the worst plane crash to happen in the United States.
The airplane that crashed was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10, tail number N110AA. It was delivered new to American Airlines after its first flight in 1972, and at time of accident it has flown for 19871 hours. It was powered by 3 General Electric CF6-6D engines.
The plane, which just arrived from Phoenix, was assigned to fly flight 191 from Chicago to Los Angeles. At 2.59pm (local time GMT-6) the plane began its taxi to runway 32 right (32R) and at 3.02pm was cleared to takeoff from the runway. However, as the pilots began to raise the nose of the plane, the number one engine, located on the left wing, broke off from the plane. With the remaining length of the runway, stopping the plane would be impossible, so the pilots continued with the takeoff, knowing that two engines are enough to fly a DC-10.
Shortly after the engine broke off, the plane climbed to 300 ft. It then began to roll to the left and turn. The pilots could not control the plane as the plane turned further left and began to fall. The plane crashed into a trailer park 4680 feet northwest from the end of runway 32R, with the left wing hitting the ground first. All 258 passengers, 13 crew and 2 others on the ground were killed. This became the worst ever plane crash in the United States, not counting the September 11 attacks which were crashed by hijackers and had more ground fatalities than those passengers killed in the planes.

Cynewulf was a member of the West Saxon witan. He led that council in expelling Sigeberht. Cynewulf was elected by the witan to rule Wessex in place of Sigeberht. He attested a at the court of King Æthelbald of Mercia. The charter was for Cynewulf to grant land to an abbot in Wiltshire. This indicates Wessex was still a dependency of Mercia. Æthelbald died a few months later. Taking advantage of this Cynewulf took back lands he lost in Berkshire and Wiltshire. Cynewulf was occupied during much of his reign in wars against the Welsh of Dumnonia. He was never able to conqueror Cornwall however. In 779, Cynewulf was defeated by Offa of Mercia at the Battle of Bensington. and Offa then retook Berkshire, and perhaps also London. Despite this defeat, there is no evidence to suggest Cynewulf became subject to Offa (as his successor, Beorhtric was).
In 786 Cynewulf was surprised and killed by Cyneheard, the brother of the king Sigeberht. The entry for the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the year 784 (actual date 786) was: "This year Cyneheard slew [killed] king Cenewulf, and he was there slain, and eighty-four men with him; then Beorhtric succeeded to the kingdom of the West Saxons..." Cynewulf had a long reign of twenty-nine years. He died leaving no heirs.

Muhammed Ahmed

Muhammad Ahmad bin Abd Allah (12 August 1845 – 22 June 1885) was a religious leader of the Sufi Samaniyya order in Sudan. On 29 June 1881, he proclaimed himself as the Mahdi or messianic redeemer of the Islamic faith. 
His proclamation came during a period of widespread resentment among the Arabic part of the Sudanese population. They resented the oppressive policies of their Turco-Egyptian rulers (who were also muslims). 
There were messianic beliefs among the various Sudanese religious sects of the time. There were earlier Mahdist movements in West Africa, and Wahabism and other puritanical forms of Islamic revivalism. The root cause of this was the growing military and economic dominance of the European powers throughout the 19th century. 
The British influenced the Sudan, and had claimed it as a "Joint Anglo-Egyptian Condominion". In general, the British were behind the rule of the Muhammed Ali dynasty in Egypt. At the time of the Mahdi, Egypt and the Sudan were ruled jointly by the Khedive, a rule which was recognised by the Ottoman Empire, and by the British. Britain's claim to the Sudan led to British forces being sent there after the Mahdi had beaten the forces of the Khedive. The British government appointed General Charles George Gordon to be Governor General of the Sudan, and that led to his famous death in Khartoum at the hands of the Mahdi's forces.
From his announcement of the Mahdiyya in June 1881 until the fall of Khartoum in January 1885, Muhammad Ahmad led a successful military campaign against the Turco-Egyptian government of the Sudan. The fighting ended with the death of Gordon in Khartoum. After Muhammad Ahmad's unexpected death on 22 June 1885, only six months after the conquest of Khartoum, his chief deputy took over the administration of the Sudan.
The rule of Sudan by the Mahdists turned out badly for its people. Sudan's economy was all but destroyed, and the population had declined by about one-half because of famine, disease, persecution, and warfare. Millions died in the Sudan from the start of the Mahdist state to its fall. None of the country's traditional institutions or loyalties remained intact. Tribes had been divided in their attitudes toward Mahdism, religious brotherhoods had been weakened, and orthodox religious leaders had vanished.
In 1895, the British Government authorized Herbert Kitchener to launch a campaign to reconquer the Sudan. Britain provided men and matériel, while Egypt financed the expedition. The Anglo-Egyptian Nile Expeditionary Force included 25,800 men, 8,600 of whom were British. The remainder were troops belonging to Egyptian units, including six battalions recruited in southern Sudan. 
An armed river flotilla escorted the force, which also had artillery support. In preparation for the attack, the British established army headquarters at Wadi Halfa. In March 1896, the campaign started. In September, Kitchener captured Dunqulah. The British then constructed a rail line from Wadi Halfa to Abu Hamad and an extension parallel to the Nile to transport troops and supplies to Berber. Anglo-Egyptian units fought and won various smaller engagements. Eventually, Kitchener's soldiers marched and sailed toward Omdurman.
In Omdurman, on 2 September 1898, the Sudanese leader, now known as the Khalifa, committed his 52,000-man army to a frontal assault against the Anglo-Egyptian force, which was massed on the plain outside the town. The outcome never was in doubt, largely because of superior British firepower. During the five-hour battle, about 11,000 Mahdists died, whereas Anglo-Egyptian losses amounted to 48 dead and fewer than 400 wounded.
Mopping-up operations took several years, but organized resistance ended when the Khalifa, who had escaped to Kurdufan, died fighting in battle at Umm Diwaykarat, November 1899. Many areas welcomed the downfall of his regime.

Cuthred of Wessex

Cuthred ( ) was a West Saxon nobleman and . He was King of Wessex from 740 to 756. Cuthred succeeded in restoring much of the of Wessex. 
At the death of King Athelheard, his Cuthred became king. During the time of Athelheard much of Wessex had been lost to King Aethelbald of Mercia. Cuthred made it known he was not as weak a ruler as Athelheard and struggled against Aethelbald being his overlord. In the first three years of Cuthred's rule he warred with Mercia. In 743 Cuthred joined Aethelbald in fighting the Welsh. By all appearances this was a friendly alliance between the two kings. But the friendship soon ended. In 748 Cuthred's son, Cynric, tried to depose his father and died in the rebellion. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the rebellion was encouraged by the Mercian king.
Two years later in 750 Cuthred put down another rebellion by Athelhun, one of his . In the day-long battle, Athelhun had fewer men but was winning until he was severely wounded. In 752, Cuthred again tried to get free of King Aethelbald. This led to a battle at Burford where Cuthred, assisted by a now faithful Athelhun, met Aethelbald and his army. The battle ended up with Aethelbald fleeing the battlefield. From that time on Cuthred maintained independence from Mercia for the rest of his reign. Cuthred died in 756. But he left a much stronger Wessex free of Mercian rule. He was succeeded by Sigeberht.
The name of Cuthred's wife is unknown. His son:

São Miguel Island

São Miguel Island, named for the Archangel Michael (), is also referred to locally as "The Green Island", is the largest and most populous island in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The island has around 138,000 inhabitants and its largest city, and in the archipelago, is Ponta Delgada.
In 1427, São Miguel became the second of the islands discovered by Gonçalo Velho Cabral to be settled by people from continental Portugal.
The first capital of the island was Vila Franca do Campo, which was devastated by a major earthquake and landslides in 1522. The tragedy helped to elevate Ponta Delgada to the administrative and economic status of capital and business centre from 1546.
With the Portuguese Restoration War (1640), the island became a commercial centre, establishing new contacts in Brazil. Some of the island’s historic buildings, including mansions and churches, date from this period; the island's development came from revenues from the export of oranges, mainly to Great Britain.
The period after the Liberal Wars allowed the economy to flourish, and the port of Ponta Delgada expanded, through the export of new crops such as tea, pineapple, and tobacco. The development of the fishing industry, cultivation of staple food and expansion of the dairy industry permitted the growth of many of the towns on the island.
The São Miguel Island has an area of . It is a narrow island; it is long (from southeast to northwest) and wide (from southwest to northeast).
The island, of volcanic nature and subject to activity, presents many mountains, mainly in the interior, dominated by the "Pico da Vara"; those mountains are cut by valleys, gullies and streams - the only waterways because there are not rivers.
The island consists of an ancient in the eastern end, and three stratovolcanoes: Sete Cidades, Fogo and Furnas. The stratovolcano of Sete Cidades is known for its large caldera () of in diameter and of mean depth; in it there are two small lakes ("Lagoa Verde" to the south and "Lagoa Azul" to north).
In the eastern part of the island is the Pico da Vara - the highest point of the island - with of altitude. In the central area, is the Sierra de Água de Pau with 940 m height and on the west lies the Caldeira das Sete Cidades, 850 m altitude.
Lying at the eastern end of the island, Pico da Vara is the focus of a Special Protection Area containing the largest remaining laurisilva forest on the island, which is home to the endemic and critically endangered bird, the Azores Bullfinch.
Its fertile lands produce cereals, tea, grapes (for wine), fruits and food for cattle.
Similar to other islands in the Azores archipelago, São Miguel is influenced by ocean currents and winds, in particular, the Gulf Stream. It functions as a moderating force in the islands, keeping temperatures hovering between throughout the year. Rainfall is distributed evenly throughout the year, although it is most abundant in the cool season. The island's location also makes it susceptible to many Atlantic storms.
The Köppen climate classification subtype for the climate of Sâo Miguel Island, in Ponta Delgada, is Csb (Mediterran Climate).
Most towns and cities are in plains, some along the coast and a few in the interior of the island. There are several communities within ancient craters (such as Sete Cidades, Furnas or Povoação), river valleys (such as Ribeira Chã, Pilar da Bretanha) or coastal deltas (Mosteiros).
There are two cities in the islands: Ponta Delgada and Ribeira Grande.
The island is divided in six municipalities ():

<doc id="417351" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=417351" title="Planets beyond Neptune">
Planets beyond Neptune

The planet Neptune was discovered in 1846. After this, many people thought that there might be more planets, which are further away from the sun than Neptune. In the early 20th century, Percival Lowell stated that there must be another planet-like body, farther out than Neptune. Lowell said that such a planet-like object could explain some irregularities in the orbits of the gas giants, in particular Uranus and Neptune. The gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to explain the irregularities. He called it "Planet X".
In 1930, Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto. This seemed to validate Lowell's hypothesis. Pluto was officially considered the ninth planet until 2006. There was a problem, however: In 1978, Pluto was found to be too small. Its gravity would be unable to affect the gas giants. This finding triggered a search for a tenth planet. The spacecraft Voyager 2 supplied new measurements in the early 1990s. According to these measurements, Pluto was shown to be smaller than first thought. According to a scientific study published at the time, this error could explain the irregularities observed in Uranus's orbit. After the study had been published, the search was largely abandoned. After 1992, the discovery of many small icy objects with similar or even wider orbits than Pluto led to a debate over whether Pluto should remain a planet, or whether it and its neighbours should, like the asteroids, be given their own separate classification. Although a number of the larger members of this group were initially described as planets, in 2006 the International Astronomical Union reclassified Pluto and its largest neighbours as dwarf planets, leaving only eight planets in the Solar System. Pluto was taken as a model for a dwarf planet.
Today, the astronomical community widely agrees that Planet X, as originally envisioned, does not exist. A number of astronomers have used the concept of Planet X to explain other anomalies observed in the outer Solar System. In popular culture, and even among some astronomers, "Planet X" has become a stand-in term for any undiscovered planet in the outer Solar System, regardless of its relationship to Lowell's hypothesis. Other trans-Neptunian planets have also been suggested, based on different evidence.
Beyond the orbit of Neptune, there is a structure called the Kuiper belt. It contains objects called centaurs. Plutinos have also been discovered beyond the orbit of Neptune. Many of these were discovered between 1980 and 1992. 
In 2004, the media again talked about the subject, when Sedna was discovered, twice as far from the sun than Pluto. Sedna is not a planet. In 2005, the discovery of Eris was announced. This was called a planet at first; but later reclassified. Today it is the biggest of the Dwarf planets. Many other objects were discovered, but none of these is made of solid rock, they more resemble asteroids and comets. 
As of 2013, it is possible that a planet outside the orbit of Neptune exists. If it does, it would have to meet the following conditions:
Different hypotheses have been put forward: A hypothetical star, located at about 50,000 AU distance, has been called Nemesis. Nemesis is either a red dwarf or a brown dwarf. In the original article, it was claimed Nemesis would orbit the sun at about 95,000 AU. The existence of Nemesis could explain events of mass extinction on earth which seem to occur at intervals of 26 million years.
A hypothetical planet, located in the Oort cloud has been called Tyche. Tyche would be at least as large as Jupiter, and could be up to ten time as large. Originally, it was postulated to be hundreds of times farther than Neptune, at a distance of between 30,000 to 50,000 AU. 
In the year 2013, neither hypothesis could be proved.

Jean de Venette

Jean de Venette (circa 1307 – after 1360) was born in Venette, France. He was a chronicler of the Hundred Years' War. He also recorded the events of the Black Plague, the revolt of the Jacquerie, and other historical events that occurred in his lifetime. Venette studied at the University of Paris. He became a Carmelite friar and shared his knowledge with his fellow monks. Jean de Venette realized the importance of education and taught many monks how to read and write. He also wrote a history of the Order of the Carmelites.
Jean de Venette became the Prior of the Carmelite monastery in Paris from 1339 to 1342, and was the Provincial Superior of France from 1341 to 1366. This later title made him the head of all of the Carmelite monasteries in the Province.
About 1340, he began to write down historical events happening around him. He said he recorded them "...in great measure as I have seen and heard them". He describes a great famine that he witnessed at age seven or eight years old. He states it started on the 15th day of March in 1315 and lasted more than two years and ended in 1318."
In that same year of 1340 he describes a great comet that appeared in Gaul. He believed, as did many people in his time, that these events were warnings from God of bad things that would happen.
In 1341, de Venette states Prince John II of Brittany died.
In 1346 he announces that "King Edward of England set sail for Normandy with a great many armed men". 
In 1348, de Venette described the Black Plague and how brave the nuns were that cared for the people. Also how many of them died as a result of their dedication.
He wrote of battles between England and France during the Hundred Years' War where he was so close, "the arrows darkened the sky around him”. Some of these battles he described were the siege of Calais in 1347 and the Battle of Poitiers (1356) where the French King and his son were captured. He gives an account of what happened after Poitiers where he states that there seem to be no rule in the kingdom. He wrote that "thieves and robbers rose up everywhere in the land and the Nobles also robbed and pillaged the peasants and took no thought for the people but rather for their own profit".
He states that in 1356, he witnessed the people of Paris building walls around their city because they did not trust the Nobles to protect them. De Venette goes into great detail, stating that the "citizens placed iron chains across the streets and crossways of Paris". They also built new walls, dug great ditches and tore down houses near the walls whether they were new or old.
Jean de Venette's writings are considered very important because he was an eye witness to many historical events. His writings are detailed and vivid. Many of the other well-known chroniclers wrote about events much later then they actually happened and relied upon one-sided accounts. They were often commissioned by Kings and Nobles who wanted their particular point of view to be stressed.
Jean de Venette died after 1360.

Athelheard of Wessex

Athelheard, also spelled Æthelheard ( 740), was a West Saxon nobleman and . He was the King of Wessex from 726 until his death. He took the powerful kingdom of Wessex left to him by Ine and lost much of it to Mercia.
When Ine stepped down as King of Wessex it caused a problem of succession. Ine's son had been killed rebelling against Ine a year earlier. Ine was now in his sixties and retired to Rome. He 'commended his kingdom to younger men'. It came down to a struggle between the two athelings, Oswald and Athelheard, Oswald was descended from Ceawlin. The same entry calls Athelheard kinsman to Ine. The two fought and Athelheard became king. In one charter Athelheard is called the brother of Ine's wife Atelburh.
In 733 Somerton was lost to King Aethelbald of Mercia. This was quickly followed by the territory beyond Selwood being lost to Mercia. Athelheard's authority was so weak that Aethelbald was able to give the Archbishop of Canterbury a gift of the monastery of Cookham in Berkshire (Wessex). Aethelbald also took Wiltshire, Sussex and much of the heartlands of Wessex. Athelheard could do nothing to prevent this loss. He also took part in Athelbald's wars with the Welsh. It seems Athelbald's wife, Frithugyth, was Mercian herself. In 737 she made a pilgrimage to Rome along with bishop Forthhere of Sherborne. Athelheard died in 740, his successor was his kinsman Cuthred.
He married Frithugyth. They had no known children.

Blurred Lines (song)

"Blurred Lines" is an R&B song by Robin Thicke. It has vocals by Pharrell and T.I. and was produced by Pharrell. It was released on March 26, 2013. It was the lead single from his album "Blurred Lines". It has reached number one in 12 countries. It became Thicke's most successful song, being his first to reach number one on the Hot 100. He had already peaked number 14 in 2007 with "Lost Without U").
"Blurred Lines" sold more than any other single in 2013. It has sold over 1.44 million copies.
Two versions of the music video were made. The first version of the video was removed from YouTube for showing topless models Emily Ratajkowski, Elle Evans, and Jessi M'Bengue. In the second version the models are not topless. Several parodies were made. On November 12, the English pop singer Lily Allen released the video for her single "Hard Out Here". It featured Mylar balloons spelling out "Lily Allen has a baggy pussy", spoofing the balloons in Thicke's video saying "Robin Thicke has a big dick".
Thicke wanted the song to sound like Got to Give It Up by Marvin Gaye. Members of Gaye's family have accused Thicke, T.I. and Pharrell of illegal copying. Thicke offered the family a six-figure sum of money to end the lawsuit but they did not accept it.
The song was banned by twenty UK universities. Essex University students started a petition to have the song banned there too. Alice Smart, a Leeds Student Union officer, said, “I’m proud that we’ve taken the decision to stop playing ‘Blurred Lines’ in our bars and clubs because the song undermines real and dangerous issues around consent. Just because the song has been commercially successful doesn’t mean we have to play it knowing that it offends a high proportion of our students.” Thicke responded on "The Today Show" to feminist criticism of the song by saying, "If you listen to the lyrics it says 'That man is not your maker.' It's actually a feminist movement in itself". He also said in an interview with the BBC that criticism of the lyrics by a rape charity is 'ridiculous'.
Thicke has said that he would like to do another song with T.I. and Pharrell.
On December 26, 2013 Rob Sheffield wrote for "Rolling Stone" that "Blurred Lines" was the worst song not just of the year, but of any year.
In December 2013 "Blurred Lines" was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Record of the Year at the Grammy Awards.
The video for "Blurred Lines" was the seventh most watched video on VEVO in 2013.

Arthus reaction

In immunology, the Arthus reaction is a kind of local allergic reaction, when antibodies react to a chemical or protein in a person's blood, and have the antibodies get stuck in the walls of blood vessels in organs such as the heart, in joints, and kidneys.
The Arthus reaction was discovered by Nicolas Maurice Arthus in 1903. Arthus repeatedly injected ingredients of horse blood under the skin of rabbits. After four injections, he found that there was swelling and that the mixture was absorbed slowly. Further injections eventually led to dying of cells.
Arthus reactions have been infrequently reported after diphtheria and tetanus toxoid vaccinations. They are rare and can cause pain, swelling, bleeding, and occasionally death of tissue within 4–12 hours after the vaccine is given.

Draco (lawgiver)

Draco (7th century BC) was the first legislator of the city of Athens in Ancient Greece. He wrote laws that were to be enforced only by a court. This constitution replaced the system of oral law and blood feuding that had governed Athens since the city was founded. Draco's laws were known for being harsh. The word draconian has come to mean unforgiving rules or laws.
Draco established this legal system during the 39th Olympiad, in about 622 or 621 BC. The laws ( - "thesmoi") he set formed the first written constitution of Athens. They were displayed in public, so that nobody would be unaware of them. The death penalty was the punishment for most crimes, even minor ones. Plutarch states: "It was a lot for himself, when asked why he had fixed the punishment of death for most offences, answered that he considered these lesser crimes to deserve it, and he had no greater punishment for more important ones."
Not much is known about Draco's life or who he was. The 10th-century Suda text tells a legendary story of his death. He was said to have died on the stage of the theatre in Aegina. In a traditional ancient Greek show of approval, his supporters threw so many hats and pieces of clothing onto his head that he suffocated.
All of Draco's laws, except the law concerning murder, were abolished by Solon in the early 6th century BC.

The Lunar Society was an important club in the Midlands of 18th century England. It was a dinner club, and a learned society. Its members were industrialists and inventors, natural philosophers (scientists), and other intellectuals. They met regularly in Birmingham and elsewhere from 1765 to 1813. 
The name arose because the society met during the full moon. The extra light made the journey home easier and safer in the absence of street lighting. The members cheerfully referred to themselves as "lunarticks", a pun on lunatics. Venues included Erasmus Darwin's home in Lichfield, Matthew Boulton's home, Soho House, and Great Barr Hall.
It leading members were Matthew Boulton, Erasmus Darwin, Thomas Day, Richard Lovell Edgeworth, Samuel Galton, Jr., James Keir, Joseph Priestley, William Small, Jonathan Stokes, James Watt, Josiah Wedgwood, John Whitehurst and William Withering. Other great men of the day visited, or corresponded with, the Society. It had no formal membership list, and was flexible in its arrangements. Anyone could be invited.
The club was seriously affected by the Priestly Riots of July 1791, which started in Birmingham, and spread. Some of the Society were personally attacked; Priestley's house was burned to the ground. The causes of the riots are not entirely clear, but for sure the rioters were against "freethinkers and dissenters". They were stirred up by being told that the dissenters were in favour of the French Revolution.

Matthew Boulton

Matthew Boulton FRS (3 September 1728 – 17 August 1809) was an English manufacturer and the business partner of Scottish engineer James Watt. 
In the last quarter of the 18th century, the partnership installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines. A great advance on the state of the art, they made possible the mechanisation of factories and mills. Boulton applied modern techniques to the minting of coins, striking millions of pieces for Britain and other countries, and supplying the Royal Mint with up-to-date equipment.
Born in Birmingham in 1728, Boulton was the son of a Birmingham manufacturer of small metal products who died when Boulton was 31. By then Boulton had managed the business for several years, and he expanded it considerably at the Soho Manufactory, built by him near Birmingham. 
When Watt's business partner, John Roebuck was unable to pay a debt to Boulton, he accepted Roebuck's share of Watt's patent as settlement. He then successfully lobbied Parliament to extend Watt's patent for an additional 17 years. This enabled the firm to market Watt's steam engine. The firm installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines in Britain and abroad, initially in mines and then in factories.
Boulton was a key member of the Lunar Society, a group of Midlands men in the arts, sciences, and theology. Members included Watt, Erasmus Darwin, Josiah Wedgwood and Joseph Priestley. The Society met each month near the full moon. Members of the Society developed concepts and techniques in science, agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and transport that laid the groundwork for the Industrial Revolution.
Boulton founded the Soho Mint, which he adapted to steam power. He sought to improve the poor state of Britain's coinage. After several years of effort obtained a contract in 1797 to produce the first British copper coinage in a quarter century. His "cartwheel" pieces were well-designed and difficult to counterfeit, and included the first striking of the large copper penny, which continued to be coined until decimalisation in 1971. He retired in 1800, though continuing to run his mint, and died in 1809. His image appears alongside James Watt on the Bank of England's new Series F £50 note.

Peasants' Revolt

The Peasants' Revolt was a rebellion of peasants in England, in 1381. It was the biggest rebellion of farmers in medieval England. The causes of the rebellion are unclear today, but there are different candidates:
Other names for the rebellion are Wat Tyler's Rebellion, after Wat Tyler who was a local leader of the peasants in the rebellion. Yet another name is Great Rising.
There were two types of peasants; serfs, and free peasants. The serfs, especially, had many difficulties. The serfs were farmers. These peasants had barely anything to live on, and did not get paid very well. The free peasants had less than all of the other social classes, except for the serfs. The free peasants had to pay rent to live "free", and also had to pay for most things (such as getting married, or collecting water). Even though they were "free" they still were controlled by the higher classes. The serfs got to live on the farms with the knights. The knights were there to protect them. The majority of peasants lived in houses which also housed the animals of the village.

Ine of Wessex

Ine ( 728) was a West Saxon nobleman who was King of Wessex from 688 to 726. He established Wessex as a true kingdom by introducing a code of laws. He strengthened the position of the in Wessex. His long reign was the most successful of any West Saxon king until Alfred the Great. 
Ine was the son of Cenred, an of Wessex. Bede says of Ine that he was "of the blood royal" meaning he was an . His brother was Ingild, ancestor of Alfred the Great. His sister Cuthburh was married to King Aldfrith of Northumbria. She was the founder of Wimborne abbey. Ine married Ethelburg, sister of Athelheard, Ine's successor.
The former king, Caedwalla, was one of Wessex's more important military leaders. When he in 688 it left a power vacuum. Wessex was broken up into several sub-kingdoms. Each was ruled by a underking. Ine many have started as a sub-king but before long was able to establish himself as the sole ruler of Wessex. Ine reorganized Wessex and established a system of . He removed the positions of sub-kings, or underkings, and replaced them with . In many respects Ine was the first true king of Wessex.
Ine wrote his laws between 688 and 694 He mentions in the bishop Erconwald who helped him. This is Erconwald who from 675 to 694 was bishop of Essex (London). He was replaced in 994 by Waldhere. But the mention of Ine's father still being alive points to the laws being written earlier in this period rather than later. The laws of Ine are the first set of laws for the Saxons of Wessex. There were earlier law codes in Wessex. But none covered as wide a range of situations as a king or his officers might have to deal with. For the next two centuries there were no law codes written after those of Ine. Not until Alfred the Great was a more extensive law code created.
In 705 the king of Essex was sheltering from Wessex. This created a serious problem between the two kings. But finally the exiles were expelled after a threat by Ine to invade the East Saxon territory. A similar situation occurred in 722 when an exile named Ealdbert was received in Sussex. Ine invaded sussex as a result. In 725 Ine invaded again and this time Ealdberht was killed. 
In 710 Ine was at war with Geraint, king of Dumnonia. This was part of his campaign against the and expanding the borders of Wessex west to the River Tamar. But he was unable to conqueror Cornwall. Ine was defeated by the Cornish in 722 at the Tamar river. All through his reign Ine seems to have been on good terms with the Mercians. There is only one incident; a battle at Wodnesbeorg in 715 between Ine and Ceolred, King of Mercia. But the only source for this informaiton, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not say who won.
Ine was a strong supporter of the Church. While he resisted the creation of a second at Sherborne, he did support the first bishop there in 705, bishop Aldhelm. Ine supported the creation of an organized church in Wessex. Formerly it was just scattered monasteries and churches. Many of Ine's laws concerned the spiritual welfare of his people. He law required baptism within thirty days of a child's birth, no working on sundays and the paying of church dues at . The first in Wessex trace back to his reign. The oldest surviving records shows Ine presided over these church councils.
In spite of his power and all his near the end of his long reign he had internal problems. There was among several of the West Saxon athelings. In 721 Ine killed a Cynewulf. For what reason is not clear, but it was at this time Ealdbert fled Wessex. In 722 he was besieged by Ine's queen, Ethelburg at Taunton. The queen's involvement seems to indicate Ealdbert was a member of the family, possibly their son. He escaped only to be killed three years later (see above). Whatever their relationship, Ine seems to have become very tired. In 726 he abdicated the throne and went to Rome. Less than two years later (728) he died there. He stated he was leaving the kingdom "to younger men" and made no attempt to name an heir. He was succeeded by Athelheard.
There is no mention in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of Ine's wife or children. Ine's brother and two sisters are recorded:

Similar systems have been started in other countries, including Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Europe.
AMBER alerts are often shown on electronic message signs on highways. This often causes bad traffic due to drivers stopping to look at the message. They are also shown on television and heard on radio.
AMBER alerts are issued by police organizations in the state that the kidnapping happens in. They have the name and a description of the child who was kidnapped, a description of the person who police think kidnapped the child, and if available, a description and license plate number of the vehicle of the person who kidnapped the child.

Fishbourne Roman Palace

Fishbourne Palace is a huge Roman villa from the 1st century AD, about thirty years after the Roman conquest of Britain. It is near the south coast in the village of Fishbourne, Chichester in West Sussex. It was built on the site of a Roman army supply base built during Claudian invasion in 43 AD. 
The palace is by far the largest known Roman residence north of the Alps. At about 500 feet (150 m) square, it is larger than Buckingham Palace. It is about the size of Nero's Golden House in Rome or the Roman villa at Piazza Armerina in Sicily. In plan it closely mirrors the layout of the emperor Domitian's palace, the Domus Flavia, completed in AD 92 on the Palatine Hill in Rome.
The rectangular palace surrounded formal gardens, the northern half of which have been reconstructed. There were extensive alterations in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, with many of the original black and white mosaics being overlaid with more sophisticated coloured work, including the perfectly preserved dolphin mosaic in the north wing. More alterations were in progress when the palace burnt down in around 270, after which it was abandoned.
One theory is that it was built for Sallustius Lucullus, a Roman governor of Britain of the late 1st century. Two inscriptions recording the presence of Lucullus have been found in nearby Chichester and the dating of the palace to the early AD 90s, would fit. If the palace was designed for Lucullus, then he may have only used it for a few years: the Roman historian Suetonius says Lucullus was executed by the delusional emperor Domitian in or shortly after AD 93.

Boxgrove quarry

Boxgrove Quarry, once a gravel quarry, is now a Palaeolithic archaeological site. It is at Boxgrove in the English county of West Sussex. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.
When excavations began in 1983, flint tools 500,000 years old were discovered. At that time this was the oldest evidence of humans discovered in the UK. In 2005 flint tools 700,000 years old were discovered at Pakefield, and in 2010 flint tools at least 800,000 years old were discovered at Happisburgh. However, Boxgrove remains a site of great importance, for many reasons. The tools were found in a largely undisturbed state, "in situ" in their prehistoric landscape. The tools and evidence of the landscape were buried several metres down.
There were many well-preserved animal bones, many flint artifacts, and hominid bones which are among some of the most ancient found in Europe. Several of the animal bones are the oldest found specimens of their species, such as the wing bone of the Great Auk found at the site in 1989. The combination of bones, stone artifacts, and the geology of the landscape gives a very complete picture of the coastal plain as it existed half a million years ago.
Parts of the site complex were excavated between 1983 and 1996 by a team led by Mark Roberts of the Institute of Archaeology, University College London. The site is in an area that features a buried chalk cliff that overlooked a flat beach (which contained a waterhole) stretching around half a mile (1 km) south to the sea.
In 1994 archaeologists unearthed a lower hominin tibia bone at the Boxgrove quarry site. This partial leg bone is dated to between 478,000 and 524,000 years old. Several teeth were also. These remains were assigned to "Homo heidelbergensis", an early proto-human species which occupied France and Great Britain. Both were connected by a land bridge at the time.

History of science

The history of science is the study of the historical development of science and scientific knowledge. The English word "scientist" is relatively recent first coined by William Whewell in the 19th century. Previously, people investigating nature called themselves "natural philosophers".
Science is a body of knowledge about the natural world, produced by scientists who observe, explain, and predict real world phenomena. Historiography of science, in contrast, often draws on the historical methods. 
Facts about the natural world have been described since classical antiquity. Ancient Greece is perhaps most famous for its contributions to astronomy and mathematics. Aristarchus of Samos came up with the idea of the Sun at the centre of what we now call the Solar system many centuries before Galileo.
Others, like Thales and Aristotle were interested in the natural world.
Scientific methods have been used since the Middle Ages (Roger Bacon), but the dawn of modern science is often traced back to the early modern period and in particular to the scientific revolution that took place in 16th- and 17th-century Europe. Important figures in the development of modern science include Isaac Newton, Johannes Kepler, Robert Boyle, Charles Darwin, Wilhelm Roux and Albert Einstein.
Scientific methods are so fundamental to modern science that some consider earlier inquiries into nature to be "pre-scientific". Traditionally, historians of science have defined science sufficiently broadly to include those inquiries.
The natural sciences are these:
There are various applied sciences which depend on one of more of the natural sciences. Medicine is an example.

Water pollution

Water pollution is the pollution of bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, the oceans, as well as groundwater. It occurs when pollutants reach these bodies of water, without treatment. Waste from homes, factories and other buildings get into the water bodies.
Water pollution is a problem for the species and ecosystems there. It affects plants and organisms living in the water. In almost all cases the effect is damaging not only to individual species and populations, but also to the wider biological communities. The color is usually green or brown but normal water can be blue.
Agriculture is one of the major sources of water pollution, because the fertilizers given to the crops for better growth are washed into rivers and lakes, which in large amounts pollute the water.
There are many chemicals that are naturally found in these bodies of water but today it is polluted by nitrates, phosphates, oil, acid from acid rain, and debris like sediments and fallen logs.

Heated shot

Heated shot is the heating of round shot before firing from muzzle-loading cannons. The purpose is for setting fire to enemy warships, buildings, or equipment. 
The use of hot shot dates back centuries. It was stopped when vessels armored with iron replaced wooden warships in the world's navies. It was a powerful weapon against wooden warships, where fire was always a hazard. It was mainly used on shore batteries and forts, due to the need for a special furnace to heat the shot. 
The use of heated shot from a ship was so dangerous, that it was against Royal Navy regulations. The American ship USS "Constitution" had a shot furnace installed, for hot shot to be fired.

Fan death

Fan death is a widely-held belief in Korea that leaving an electric fan on overnight will kill a person. However, no people are known to have been killed by this.
The supposed cause of death is often said to be carbon monoxide poisoning, although this is impossible because an electric motor does not create carbon monoxide. Another supposed cause is asphyxiation, which is also impossible because a fan does not remove any air from a room. Hypothermia is also said to be the cause, although it too is impossible because a fan does not lower the temperature of the body enough to cause hypothermia.

Several architects have created the houses for the different species in the zoo. The Antelope House dates to 1872 and the Elephant House to 1873. The Hippopotamus House dates to 1997. It demonstrates the application of modern zoo concepts to a particular species. The hippos live under a roof of 13,000 square feet of glass solar panel. They can now be seen above and beneath the water.
During World War II, the elephants at the Zoo were killed in the air raids of September 7-8, 1941. Zoo officials also killed animals at the time. In November 1943, more than 1,000 bombs were dropped over the zoo, destroying many buildings and burning to death many animals. As many as 12,000 animals were killed in the Berlin Zoological Garden during the bombings of World War II.

Caedwalla of Wessex

Caedwalla, also spelled Cædwalla (c. 659–689), was the King of Wessex from until his abdication in 688. His name comes from the British name Cadwallon. He was a powerful king and war leader. It was through his efforts that Wessex rose to become the third kingdom, after Northumbria and Mercia, in what would become the seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of the heptarchy. Caedwalla was a pagan king who fought for and promoted Christianity.
Caedwalla was born . He the son of Cenberht (Coenbryht) and the brother of Mul. They were of the royal house of the Gewissae. Caedwalla was a descendant of Cerdic. His father, an in Wessex, was killed in 661 when Caedwalla was about two years old. His family took refuge in the great forest of the Caedwalla was apparently one of those trying to claim territory in Wessex after the death of Cenwalh. But he was exiled from Wessex in 680 by Centwine. During that time he had gathered around him a band of warriors. In 685 Caedwalla "began to strive for the kingdom" (or wanted to become king). He repeatedly attacked Sussex and killed king Ethelwalth. Two of the Sussex ealdormen drove Caedwalla out of that kingdom. Still landless, Caedwalla turned his attentions again towards Wessex. This same year Centwine retired to a monastery and the throne of Wessex.
By 686 Caedwalla was able to declare himself king. The remaining underkings in Wessex did not oppose him and kept their territories. During the three years Caedwalla reigned over Wessex he was constantly at war. He and his brother Mul ravaged Kent in 686. After subjecting Kent to his rule he left his brother Mul in charge as king of Kent. That summer he attacked Sussex and killed king Berhthun. In 687 the men of Kent rose up against Mul and he was burned with twelve of his companions. They soon restored their own royal line on the throne. Caedwalla invaded a second time and ruled Kent himself. Caedwalla next invaded the Isle of Wight. King Arwald was killed. Caewalla allowed the two young athelings of Wight, Arwald's brothers, to convert to Christianity before executing them. He then began to kill all the inhabitants and replace them with settlers from Wessex. Although still a pagan, he gave several large estates on the Isle of Wight to bishop Wilfrid. It was during his war on the Isle of Wight that Caedwalla was badly wounded. His wound seemed mortal to him. But he had succeeded in conquering most of the south-east of England. In 688 he abdicated the throne of Wessex. He was able to journey to Rome where on Easter day 689, he was baptised by Pope Sergius. About ten days later on 20 April he died and was buried in Rome. He set a precedent for the west Saxon kings who followed him to dominate all of south-east England.
Caedwalla remained a pagan until end of his life. He was a friend of bishop Wilfrid and at times called himself the defender of the church. He granted land for a monastery to an Abbot Ecgbald at Hoo in Kent. His authority in Surrey is demonstrated by a grant of land for an monastery in Farnham. He saw his attempts to remove all the Jutes from the Isle of Wight as a war of Christianity against the pagans. When he left England on his pilgrimage to Rome he stopped at Calais and donated money to build a church there. He did the same at the court of the Lombards before going on to Rome. Caedwalla was succeeded by Ine.

The Inheritors (novel)

The Inheritors is the 1955 second novel by the British author William Golding, who is best known for "Lord of the Flies". It was his personal favourite, and concerns the extinction of one of the last remaining tribes of Neanderthals at the hands of the more sophisticated (and malevolent) "Homo sapiens".
One of the band, Lok, is a "point of view" character. He is the one we follow as one by one the adults of the band die or are killed, then the young are stolen by the "new people" The new people are a group of early modern humans. Lok and Fa, the remaining adults, are both fascinated and repelled by the new people. They observe their actions and rituals with amazement, only slowly understanding that harm is meant by the 'sticks' (arrows) of the new people.
Lok's people have powerful sense-impressions and feelings, and appear sometimes to share thoughts in a near-telepathic way. They live very simply, using their mental abilities to connect to one another without extensive vocabulary or the kinds of memories that create culture. They have wide knowledge of food sources, mostly roots and vegetables. Their lives are lived so much in the present that the reader realizes they are very different from us, living in something like an eternal present, or at least a present broken and shaped by seasons. The way they cope with planning and imagination is by saying the phrase "I have a picture", and then talking about their thoughts.
In the final chapter, we move to the point of view of the new race, more or less modern humans fleeing in their boats. Apparently they are terribly afraid of the Neanderthals whom they believe to be devils of the forest. This last chapter, the only one written from the humans' point of view, points to the inheritance of the world by the new species.

Bird cage

A bird cage (sometimes birdcage) is a cage to hold a bird. Bird cages are used in the home to contain a pet bird, such as a parakeet or a canary. Bird cages used in the home are made of metal wire. A bird cage usually has seed and water dishes, a cuttle bone, and toys such as little bells and mirrors. There are perches for the bird to sit on. A cage may be hung from a ceiling or a floor stand. The floor of the cage is usually lined with some sort of paper to absorb the bird's droppings, water spills, etc.
Usually, the larger a bird is, a larger cage is needed. A bird that spends most of its time caged will also need a larger cage. Birds that are breeding might need a nest inside the cage.

Ealdorman

An ealdorman (from Old English "ealdorman", lit. "elder man"; plural: "ealdormen") is a term used for a high-ranking royal official who was in charge of one or more shires. The title dates from the sixth century and was in use up to the time of King Canute. Their position was a combination of administrator, judge and military . Ealdormen were the of the later English earls.
An ealdorman was an appointee of the king who governed one or more shires or territories. The ealdorman was also responsible for leading his local fyrd (part-time army) in battle. But these armies owed their first to their ealdorman. Very often the support of one or more ealdormen could help a royal candidate to become king. In many cases ealdormen succeeded yet kept the same rights. Several had been underkings and were members of the royal family. In early Anglo-Saxon documents ealdormen are also termed ", "", or " in documents of the time.
The term first appears in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle under the year 568. But it's use probably predates that entry. As early as the seventh century ealdormen were seen as judges. But the development of the shire may have come later. As ealdormanries began to become (passed down from father to son) the families who held them became more and more powerful. Several rose in power second only to the king. They were described in documents by the term "". In the eighth century these occurred in Northumbria, Mercia and Kent. The term "patricius" was roughly the same as the office of mayor of the palace in the Merovingian dynasty of Frankish kings. This could be dangerous for a king to have someone so powerful exercising power in his name. In the eighth and ninth centuries the most dangerous ealdormen were those who claimed royal descent. They could and in some cases did rise up against a king and took the throne themselves. In the very basic royal administrations of the time a king needed to depend on his ealdormen. A king could create ealdormen from his own family. But he could only fill only a portion of the ealdormanries in that way. As the families of ealdormen banded together in ties of mutual support it became more difficult to remove an ealdorman.
The term ealdorman was replaced by the term earl during the eleventh century. In the laws of King Canute both ealdormen and earls are mentioned. But there was no distinction made between them. After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the title Earl was no longer with "dux" or "princeps". They were written at times as "" (count). King William replaced most Anglo-Saxon earls with his own . He then limited the power of most earls giving them control of counties, castles or other territories. A few were given more power. These were titled Earl palatine.

Centwine of Wessex

Centwine ( 685) was King of Wessex from to 685. He appears to have been one of several underkings of Wessex after the death of Cenwalh. But at some point he united the kingdom of Wessex under his rule. 
Centwine was the probable son of Cynegils and grandson of Ceolwulf, King of Wessex. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Centwine became king . Also that he succeeded Aescwine. Bede wrote that after the death of King Cenwalh: "his under-rulers took upon them the kingdom of the people, and dividing it among themselves, held it ten years". Bede's view of Aescwine and Centwine as underkings may represent the views of King Ine. His family ruled Wessex in Bede's time. If the kingdom did fragment following Cenwalh's death, it was reunited during Centwine's reign. An entry under 682 in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that "Centwine drove the Britons to the sea". Aldhelm wrote Centwine won three major victories but does not say who he defeated. Centwine is reported to have and became a monk. The date of his death is unknown.
Centwine married Eangyth, niece of Eorcenbert of Kent. Her sister, Eormenburh was married to King Egfrith of Northumbria. Together they had:

Les Misérables is a novel by Victor Hugo. It was published in 1862. The story is about a former convict named Jean Valjean. He tries to find a meaningful life, but is followed by a police officer. The story has been made into movies several times. It has also been made into a musical. He is trying to run away after being convicted by the police since he stole bread to feed his sister.
The work describes French society between the reign of Napoleon and that of Louis Philippe I. One of the main characters, Marius, takes part in the June Rebellion.
Hugo based some of his characters on the lives of real people. That way, Valjean is probably based upon Eugène François Vidocq. He probably used the story of Bienvenu de Miollis to base the Bishop of Digne on. De Mollis was the bishop of Digne from 1805 to 1838. Enjolras, a revolutionary leader is probably based on Louise Michel, a French anarchist.

There are five types of levels. In the first type, Mario has to pick up a key and take it to a locked door, then find and pick up the Mini-Mario toy at the end of the level. In the second type, Mario has to guide six Mini-Mario toys to the Toy Box. While doing so, he has to protect them from dangers in the level. In the third type, Mario has to fight Donkey Kong in order to go to the next world. In the fourth type, the Plus level, Mario has to turn on one Mini-Mario with a key and take it to the door. The fifth type of level, the Expert level, plays like the first type of level, but is harder.

Blind experiment

A blind or blinded experiment is a test or experiment in 
where the experimenter does not know which treatment is given to a subject. The idea is to avoid bias which the experimenter might otherwise introduce. If both tester and subject are blinded, the trial is a double-blind trial.
Suppose consumers are asked to compare the tastes of different brands of a product. Obviously, the identities of the product should be hidden – otherwise consumers tend to prefer the brand they are familiar with. Similarly, when testing a pharmaceutical drug, both patients and experimenter should not know the dosage being given in each case.
The opposite of a blind trial is an open trial. The terms blind (adjective) or to blind (transitive verb) when used in this sense are figurative extensions of the literal idea of blindfolding someone. 
Blind experiments went on to be used outside of purely scientific settings. In 1817, a committee of scientists and musicians compared a Stradivarius violin to one with a guitar-like design made by the naval engineer François Chanot. A well-known violinist played each instrument while the committee listened in the next room to avoid prejudice.
One of the first essays advocating a blinded approach to experiments in general came from Claude Bernard in the latter half of the 19th century, who recommended splitting any scientific experiment between the theorist who conceives the experiment and a naive (and preferably uneducated) observer who registers the results without foreknowledge of the theory or hypothesis being tested. This suggestion contrasted starkly with the prevalent Enlightenment-era attitude that scientific observation can only be objectively valid when undertaken by a well-educated, informed scientist.
Double-blind methods came into especial prominence in the mid-20th century.
Double-blind describes an especially stringent way of conducting an experiment. It tries to eliminate subjective, unrecognized biases carried by an experiment's subjects "and"</u/l> conductors.
In a double-blind experiment, neither the participants nor the researchers know which participants belong to the control group, and which to the test group. Random assignment of test subjects to the experimental and control groups is the key to any double-blind research design. The information about who the subjects were, and which group they belonged to, is kept by a third party until the study is over.
Double-blind methods can be applied to any experimental situation in which there is a possibility that the results will be affected by conscious/unconscious bias on the part of researchers, participants, or both.

Dalmatian City-states

The ”’Dalmatian City-states”’ were 8 cities in Dalmatia where the autoctonous Dalmatian Italians survived the Slav invasions, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. These cities were: Zara, Spalato, Ragusa, Cattaro, Trau, Ossero (called even Cherso or Crespa), Veglia and Arbe.
At the beginning of the seventh century the Avars with some Slav tribes devastated and conquered the Roman province of Dalmatia. The local Latin population survived only in the coast and islands of Dalmatia. There they created 8 little cities that maintained political links with the Byzantine Empire, that defended these cities allowing their commerce.
The original name of the cities was Jadera, Spalatum, Crespa, Arba, Tragurium, Vecla, Ragusium and Cattarum. The language and the laws where initially Latin, but after a few centuries they developed their own neolatin language (the "Dalmatico"), that lasted until the nineteenth century.
The cities were maritime centers with a huge commerce mainly with the Italian peninsula and with the growing Republic of Venice. From it they received their Italian culture and arts. After the year 1000 AD, the Venetian Doge Orseolo II started to control all coastal Dalmatia, but it was only in 1420 AD that Venice was able to obtain the full domination of these City-states.
In this way seven of these cities became part of the Venetian republic: Zara was the most Venetian (or Italian) of them, remaining Italian until WWII.
But one of the City-states, Ragusium (or Ragusa) was dominated by Venice only for a few decades in the eleventh century and later created the famous "Repubblica di Ragusa". This was an autonomous state under the protection of the Ottoman empire, and lasted until the conquest by Napoleon in 1804 AD when was united to the Napoleonic kingdom of Italy.

Anthony of Padua, O.F.M. (born Fernando Martins de Bulhões; 15 August 1195 – 13 June 1231), was a Portuguese Catholic priest. He was a friar of the Franciscan Order. He was born and raised in a rich family in Lisbon. Anthony was canonised as a saint on 30 May 1232, less than a year after his death. He is considered a patron saint of lost or stolen items.
He goes that he had a book of sacred songs in which he'd written his own personal notes. A young novice from his complex of buildings decided to leave the order. As he was leaving, he stole Anthony's book. Anthony prayed for it to be returned. Some time later the missing novice returned to the order and asked to be taken back in, and returned Anthony's book. This was deemed a miracle.
Anthony died in Padua, Italy. After his death, because of that incident, people prayed to Anthony when they had lost something or had it stolen. Some of them got their things back. Those were also deemed "miracles." They are what got him sainthood.

Surface water

Surface water is water on the surface of the planet, above the ground. It is the water in rivers, lakes, wetlands and oceans. It is different to groundwater, which is in the soil, and atmospheric water, which is in the sky.
Fresh surface water is added to by precipitation and by taking ground-water from the ground. It is lost through evaporation, where it becomes atmospheric water, or through seepage into the ground, where it becomes ground water. It is also lost through use by plants for transpiration, animals for drinking, or by humans for agriculture, washing and other purposes. Fresh water is also discharged to the ocean, where it becomes salt water.

Tetanuran

The tetanurans are a clade which includes most theropod dinosaurs, including birds. Tetanurans first appear in the Jurassic. It is a large group of theropod dinosaurs. Gauthier's paper was the first serious application of the science of cladistics to vertebrate paleontology.
The term refers to the stiff tail which was held above the ground as a counterweight when the animal walked or ran.
Tetanurae are defined as all theropods more closely related to modern birds than to "Ceratosaurus". Gauthier considered it to consist of Carnosauria and Coelurosauria. Modern birds are the only living representatives of the clade Tetanurae.
