Barbara Ann Scott

Barbara Ann Scott (May 9, 1928 - September 30, 2012) was a Canadian figure skater. Scott was born in Ottawa, Ontario. She was a champion in the 1948 Winter Olympics, a two-time World Champion and a four time Canadian national champion. She was known as "Canada's Sweetheart" when she returned. Admirers greeted her as she returned from the 1948 Olympic games, and March 9th was then declared Barbara Ann Scott Day. In that very same skating season, she dominated North American, European, and World championships, and did this all at a young age.
She was the only Canadian to win the Olympic ladies' singles gold medal, the first North American to win three major titles in one year and the only Canadian to win a European Championship. Long after her victory, sixty-one years later, Scott carried the Olympic torch into the chamber before the 2010 Vancouver Olympic games. Two months later, she carried the Olympic flag along with seven other Canadians into the Opening Ceremonies.
Barbara was a great figure skater. It is an honor to be able to carry both the Olympic torch and the Olympic flag. She was known well by all of the people in Ottawa, Ontario, where she was born. Barbara was truly a wonderful figure skater for Canada in ladies’ singles (skating by themselves).

Sonic the Hedgehog CD

Sonic the Hedgehog CD or Sonic CD is a platformer video game created by Sega. It is part of the "Sonic the Hedgehog" series. It was released for the Sega CD game console in 1993. In chronological order it is after the first game and "before the sequel." The game involves the use of a time travel system that allows Sonic to travel to both the past and the future in a level. Each zone has four variants: the "past," the "present," the "good future," and the "bad future." Each has different graphics, music, enemies, and obstacles. The game introduces two characters to the "Sonic the Hedgehog" series: Amy Rose, a pink female hedgehog with a hammer as a weapon, and Metal Sonic, an evil robotic version of Sonic.

Fork bomb

A fork bomb is a way of stopping a computer from running by making many copies of a program. A fork bomb copies itself into more than two copies, which then copy themselves into four copies. Then both the original and the copy will keep making copies until the computer can no longer handle it and crash.
For example, a simple fork bomb using the bash shell script is :
Here, a function is defined by the name " : ". Inside the curly braces, this function is called and its output is given again to the same function. The " & " is used to run the process in background. The semicolon (" ; ") marks end of the function. The last colon (" : ") calls the function for first time. After that the function keeps on calling itself until computer runs out of memory.

Tutu (plant)

Tutu is a common name of Māori origin for plants in the genus "Coriaria" (Coriariaceae) found in New Zealand.
Six New Zealand native species are known by the name:
They are shrubs or trees; some are endemic to New Zealand. Most of the plant parts are poisonous, containing the neurotoxin tutin.
Both the seeds and sap of tutu are highly poisonous, resulting in many cattle deaths in the early days of European settlement. After removing the poisonous seeds, Māori people prepared a drink from the fruit, which they often boiled with a type of seaweed (rimu). The resulting jelly (rehia) was then fermented.
Honey containing tutin can be produced by honey bees feeding on honeydew produced by sap-sucking vine hopper insects ("Scolypopa australis") feeding on tutu. The toxin is in the sap of the Tutu bush. This sap is eaten by the hoppers, but not all is digested. The undigested sap which contains a lot of plant sugars as well as tutin is excreted as honeydew onto the leaves of the bush. Bees then gather the honeydew and toxic honey is the result.
The last recorded deaths from eating honey containing tutin were in Northland, New Zealand, in 1890, although sporadic outbreaks of toxic honey poisoning continue to occur. Poisoning symptoms include delirium, vomiting, and coma.

Ernest Hollings

Ernest Frederick "Fritz" Hollings (born January 1, 1922) is an American politician. Hollings served as a Democratic United States Senator from South Carolina from 1966 to 2005, as well as the 106th Governor of South Carolina (1959–1963) and the 77th Lieutenant Governor (1955–1959). He served 38 years and 55 days in the Senate, which makes him the 8th-longest-serving Senator in history.
Following the death of John Glenn in December 2016, Hollings became the oldest living former United States senator.
Hollings was born on January 1, 1922 in Charleston, South Carolina. He studied at The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina and at the University of South Carolina School of Law.
As governor of South Carolina from January 20, 1959 to January 15, 1963, Hollings worked to improve the state's educational system, helping to bring more industry and employment opportunities to the state. His term in office saw the establishment of the state's technical education system and its educational television network. He also called for and achieved significant increases in teachers' salaries, bringing them closer to the regional average. At the 1961 Governor's Conference on Business, Industry, Education and Agriculture in Columbia, S.C., he declared, "Today, in our complex society, education is the cornerstone upon which economic development must be built--and prosperity assured."
He tried to win the Democratic nomination for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1962 but lost to incumbent Olin D. Johnston.
For 36 years (until January 2003), he served alongside Republican Strom Thurmond, making them the longest-serving Senate duo ever. This made him the longest-serving junior senator ever, even though he had more seniority than all but a few of his colleagues. Thurmond and Hollings generally had a good relationship despite their sometimes sharp philosophical differences, and frequently collaborated on legislation and projects to benefit South Carolina. Only Thurmond, Robert Byrd, Ted Kennedy, Daniel Inouye, Carl Hayden, John Stennis and Ted Stevens served longer in the Senate than Hollings.
Hollings remained very popular in South Carolina over the years, even as the state became increasingly friendly to Republicans at the national level. In his first three bids for a full term, he never dropped below 60 percent of the vote. In the 1992 election, however, he faced an unexpectedly close race against former Congressman Tommy Hartnett in what was otherwise a very good year for Democrats nationally. Hartnett had represented the Charleston area in Congress from 1981 to 1987, thus making him Hollings' congressman. His appeal in the Lowcountry — traditionally a swing region at the state level — enabled him to hold Hollings to only 50 percent of the vote.
In his last Senate race in 1998, Hollings faced Republican congressman Bob Inglis. One of the more heated and notable moments of the race was a newspaper interview in which Hollings referred to Inglis as a "goddamn skunk". Hollings was re-elected 52%-45%.
Hollings tried to seek the Democratic lead running mate during the 1984 Presidential race. He lost to Walter Mondale.
Hollings was married to Martha Patricia Salley until they divorced. Then he was married to Rita Liddy from 1971 until her death in 2012. He had four children with Patricia. He now lives in Charleston, South Carolina.

James Arthur Baldwin (August 2, 1924 – December 1, 1987) was an American novelist, essayist, playwright, poet, and social critic.
Baldwin's essays, such as the collection "Notes of a Native Son" (1955), explore racial, sexual, and class maters in Western societies, most notably in mid-20th-century America, and their inevitable if unnamable tensions with personal identity, something taken for granted, uncertainties, yearning, and questing.
Baldwin was born on August 2, 1924 in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City. He studied at DeWitt Clinton High School and at The New School. Baldwin was gay. He married and had no children. Baldwin died on December 1, 1987 in Saint-Paul de Vence, France from esophageal cancer, aged 63.

Aboriginal Land Trust

In Australia, an Aboriginal Land Trust (ALT) is a type of non-profit organisation that holds the freehold title to an area of land on behalf of a community of Aboriginal Australians. The land is granted to a community by the government under a perpetual lease, usually after the community makes a legal claim of traditional ownership. Land granted under Aboriginal title is inalienable, meaning it can not be bought, sold, traded or given away. The Land Trust is the organisation appointed by the community to legally hold the title deeds.
Several states and territories have enacted laws to establish Aboriginal Land Trusts, but not all. In South Australia, there is a single Aboriginal Lands Trust. It was created under the Aboriginal Lands Trust Act, 1966. It holds title to Aboriginal land in South Australia and organises the management and control of those lands. The Aboriginal Lands Trust in Western Australia was created by the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act, 1972. It acquires and holds land and manages it for the benefit of Aboriginal communities. It holds about 27 million hectares (11%) of the state's land, most of which was previously held by the state government. In Queensland, there are multiple Land Trusts. They were created under the state's Aboriginal Land Act, 1991. In the Northern Territory, Land Trusts are governed under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, 1976, which also governs the way in which groups can make claims to land. The ALTs hold the title to land handed back to the traditional Aboriginal owners through the Land Rights Act.

Petermann Aboriginal Land Trust

The Petermann Aboriginal Land Trust is a land trust for a large block of land in the southwest corner of the Northern Territory, Australia. It was created by law in July 1978. The block of land (called Northern Territory Portion 1634) covers an area of . It makes up most of the area of the old Petermann Reserve (1920–1977). The land's traditional owners are mostly Pitjantjatjara, Yankunytjatjara and Luritja people. This includes residents of Kaltukatjara and over 50 family outstations.
The block held by the Petermann ALT is surrounded by other Aboriginal land blocks on all sides. It borders the Ngaanyatjarra Lands to the west (in Western Australia), the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands to the south (in South Australia), Haasts Bluff Aboriginal Land Trust to the north, and Katiti and Urrampinyi Iltjiltajarri Aboriginal Land Trusts to the east.
In March 1920, an area of land in the southwest corner of the Northern Territory was made into an aboriginal reservation, called the Petermann Reserve. It was meant to be a temporary refuge (safe place) for the Aboriginal families living in the area, many of whom were still living traditional, nomadic lifestyles. It bordered other large reserves created in Western Australia and South Australia, and together the area was known as the Central Australian Aboriginal Reserve. In 1940, the Petermann Reserve was made smaller, to allow people to look for gold. In was made smaller again in 1958, when the government excised the area around Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa to create the Ayers Rock–Mt Olga National Park.
In 1976, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, which allowed for Aboriginal communities to be granted freehold title to land if they could show that they lived on the land for many years. Section 4 of the act gave the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs the power to establish Aboriginal Land Trusts to look after the title. The trusts would be established by publishing notices in the government gazette. In 1977, the old Petermann Reserve land was transferred to the Petermann Land Trust and to other Aboriginal land-owning corporations. The boundaries of the Petermann trust were first described in the "Gazette" on 21 July 1978. They were later made into law by Act No. 109 of 1985, which went into effect on 16 October 1985.

<doc id="392889" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=392889" title="The Cartful">
The Cartful

The Cartful "車仔檔" , also known as portable stall and mobile stall, is a style of hawker stall originated from the street vendors selling inexpensive street food, like eggette, Tang Cong Bing 糖葱餅, and cart noodle, in the 1950s.This style of selling is part of Hong Kong traditional culture. It reflects people’s way of living and their spirits. In recent years, the operation of the cartful faces challenges due to the government policies and modernization.
Hong Kong has been experiencing economic downturn in the 1950s, meanwhile, refugees from the Mainland fled to Hong Kong constantly after the establishment of The People's Republic of China, leading to an increase in population. People struggled to make a living, they started to operate mobile stall using wooden carts with a low production cost. With the portable carts, street vendors could get away in time from being arrested by the police. In the 1970s and 1980s, a wide variety of products are sold then. Besides food and snacks, household goods, clothing and kitchenware could be found in the carful in place like Sham Shui Po.
The cartful sells mainly two kinds of products, street food and clothes. Some traditional street food such as eggette, curry fish balls and fried chestnuts are favored by teenagers. These $10-odd snacks are cheap but delicious. They smell very nice so that they drive people queuing for them. The cartful owners make the snacks once they are ordered so as to keep them hot and fresh. Apart from the street snacks, the carful also sells clothes, sometimes handbags. Women love buying free-sized legging and socks. Though customers cannot try fitting the products, they are willing to buy them.
There are mainly two types of owners which are the unemployed middle-aged and the unlicensed hawkers. Both of them are the main support of their family while they cannot find a suitable job. As a result, they choose to run the carful because it can help them make a decent living and avoid the high rent. The carful of these kinds are operated by family units.
Most of the cartful can be found near the public housings, schools and MTR stations, because a steady stream of people from these places can help increase their business turnover.
The cartful fully reveals Hong Kong spirits: diligence and fast paced lifestyle. With a small amount of capital and time, owners can earn huge profit from the whole day sales by moving their cart around without paying high rent.
This traditional hawking style is threatened because of the government policy and modernization. As the law prohibits unlicensed hawking, many mobile stalls have been demolished. Yet, the government sets up markets in different districts like Tin Sau Hui and Wan Chai Tai Yuen Street in order to gather the mobile stalls. 
Some of the citizens support the government plan since they think it is hygienic and peaceful without the mobile stalls on street, while others object to the cruel government policy due to the reminiscence of the cartful.

<doc id="392899" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=392899" title="Short-term memory">
Short-term memory

Short term memory is the ability to keep information in mind for a short amount time, such as remembering a phone number long enough to find a piece of paper. The mind is able to store memory that is learned recently for a small period of time for use again. The amount of time the mind is able to do this is usually within seconds.
The opposite of short-term memory is long-term memory, which is where things can be stored in the mind for a long time to be recalled later.
Memory is what goes on in the brain in storing and retrieving past experiences. These processes do what we call remembering. Memory is the foundation of intelligence and the ability to adapt from learning. 
Information about a needle being sharp and hurtful when touched by bare hands is processed to make a response of survival and self-preservation. This leads to us (and other animals) to change what we do when we met needles a second time. Memory, which starts out as short-term memory allows for learning, and helps intelligent behavior.
Donald Hebb (1904-1985) was the first to come up with a way to tell the difference between short-term and long-term memory. When the brain receives an input, like something that is seen or heard, a sensory memory keeps a copy of what is seen or heard, but this memory lasts for only about a few seconds. Anything that is retained in the brain longer depends on our selective attention, things that we "notice" are kept in short-term memory for up to a few minutes. This memory is thought to be dependent on electrical activity in the brain and is easily destroyed by interruption or interference. Short-term memory includes iconic memory as well, which holds visual images; acoustic memory, to hold sounds; and working memory, which is an active process to keep a memory until it is put to use.
Memories which are stored for longer than this are called long-term memory. Hebb had a theory of long-term memory as a change in the strength of connections between the neurons. Long-term memory is relatively permanent storage and the process involves the creation of new proteins. 
Whether or not the information is stored in long-term memory depends on its importance. Usually for animals memories that are made during times of stress and discomfort are important for adaptive values. In the future they help avoid anything that will bring them stress. This is among the many other reason a memory may become a long-term memory simply due to the nature of the mammal and what the memory itself relates to.
Short-term memory has a limited duration, and the contents decay over time. The decay idea is usually paired by the idea of repeating the memory over and over. In order to overcome the limitation of short-term memory, and retain information for a longer amount of time, it has to be repeated either by saying it out loud of by saying it mentally repeatedly. By doing this the information will re-enter the short-term process and be kept for a further period.
Forgetting greatly limits the information that can be kept over a short period of time. The capacity of short-term memory is finite, but there is no clear unit of measurement for what that is. Memory span is the term used to describe this, where there is only a certain amount of information that can be memorized over a short period until it is lost.
The capacity of short-term memory leads to the question of the capacity of short-term memory as a whole. At present there is no way of telling whether a piece of information will be stored as short-term memory or not. In an experiment done to determine the capacity of short-term memory individuals had to memory a list of items and recall it, and it was suggested that the span of their short-term memory was reached when they could no longer remember the list in order. 
There are many conditions that can impact short-term memory they can range from simple distractions to serious disorders. The loss of memory is natural and is expected with aging. By the age of 55 it is found experimentally that the loss of memory starts to occur which usually occurs more often with long-term memory loss, age very much affects the short-term memory as well. 
There are many other facts, which affect memory loss beside advanced age, many disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Aphasia, Schizophrenia, Advanced age, and Posttraumatic stress disorder are linked to the loss of memory.

Celestial equator

The celestial equator is a term in observational astronomy. It is a great circle on the imaginary celestial sphere, in the same plane as the Earth's equator. In other words, it is a projection of the terrestrial equator out into space. As a result of the Earth's axial tilt, the celestial equator is inclined by 23.4° with respect to the ecliptic plane.
An observer standing on the Earth's equator visualizes the celestial equator as a semicircle passing directly overhead through the zenith. As the observer moves north (or south), the celestial equator tilts towards the southern (or northern) horizon. At the poles, the celestial equator is parallel to the horizon.
The observer always sees the ends of the semicircle disappear over the horizon exactly due east and due west, regardless of the observer's position on Earth.

Epictetus

Epictetus was an Ancient Greek philosopher. He was born in Hierapolis in Phrygia around 55 AD. presumably at Hierapolis, Phrygia. The name his parents gave him is unknown; the word "epíktetos" (επίκτητος) in Greek simply means "acquired." He spent his youth as a slave in Rome to Epaphroditos, a rich freedman and secretary to Nero. The city was near the modern-day town of Pamukkale in Turkey. He died around 135 AD in Nikopolis in Epirus, in Greece. He was one of the most influential philosophers of the late Stoa. Epictetus founded a school of philosophy, where he also taught. None of his writing survive, but one of his pupils, Arrian, wrote what he was taught. 
Philosophy, Epictetus taught, is a way of life and not just a theoretical discipline. To Epictetus, all external events are determined by fate, and are thus beyond our control; we should accept whatever happens calmly and dispassionately. However, individuals are responsible for their own actions, which they can examine and control through rigorous self-discipline. 
Suffering occurs from trying to control what is uncontrollable, or from neglecting what is within our power. As part of the universal city that is the universe, it is our duty to care for all our fellow men. Those who follow these precepts will achieve happiness and peace of mind.

Interstellar travel

Interstellar space travel is manned or unmanned travel between stars. Interstellar travel is much more difficult than travel within the Solar System, though travel in starships is a staple of science fiction. Actually, there is no suitable technology at present. However, the idea of a probe with an ion engine has been studied. The energy would come through a laser base station. 
Given sufficient travel time and engineering work, both unmanned and sleeper ship interstellar travel seem possible. Both present considerable technological and economic challenges which are unlikely to be met in the near future, particularly for manned probes. NASA, ESA and other space agencies have done research into these topics for several years, and have worked out some theoretical approaches.
Energy requirements appear to make interstellar travel impractical for "generation ships", but less so for heavily shielded sleeper ships.
The main challenge facing interstellar travel is the vast distances that have to be covered. This means that a very great speed and/or a very long travel time is needed. The travel time with most realistic propulsion methods would be from decades to millennia.
Hence an interstellar ship would be much more exposed to the hazards found in interplanetary travel, including vacuum, radiation, weightlessness, and micrometeoroids. At high speeds the vehicle would be penetrated by many microscopic particles of matter unless heavily shielded. Carrying the shield would greatly increase the propulsion problems. 
Cosmic rays are of great interest because there is no protection outside the atmosphere and magnetic field. The energies of the most energetic ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) have been observed to approach 3 × 10 eV, about 40 million times the energy of particles accelerated by the Large Hadron Collider. At 50 J, the highest-energy ultra-high-energy cosmic rays have energies comparable to the kinetic energy of a baseball. As a result of these discoveries, there has been interest in investigating cosmic rays of even greater energies. Most cosmic rays, however, do not have such extreme energies. The energy distribution of cosmic rays peaks at .
A significant factor is the energy needed for a reasonable travel time. A lower bound for the required energy is the kinetic energy K = ½ mv where m is the final mass. If deceleration on arrival is desired and cannot be achieved by any means other than the engines of the ship, then the required energy at least doubles, because the energy needed to halt the ship equals the energy needed to accelerate it to travel speed.
The velocity for a manned round trip of a few decades to even the nearest star is thousands of times greater than those of present space vehicles. This means that due to the v term in the kinetic energy formula, millions of times as much energy is required. Accelerating one ton to one-tenth of the speed of light requires at least 450 PJ or 4.5  J or 125 billion kWh, not accounting for losses. 
The source of energy has to be carried, since solar panels do not work far from the Sun and other stars. The magnitude of this energy may make interstellar travel impossible. One engineer stated “At least 100 times the total energy output of the entire world [in a given year] would be required for the voyage (to Alpha Centauri)”.
interstellar dust and gas may cause considerable damage to the craft, due to the high relative speeds and large kinetic energies involved. Larger objects (such as bigger dust grains) are far less common, but would be much more destructive. . 
The long travel times make it difficult to design manned missions. The fundamental limits of space-time present another challenge. Also, interstellar trips would be hard to justify for economic reasons.
It can be argued that an interstellar mission which cannot be completed within 50 years should not be started at all. Instead, the resources should be invested in designing a better propulsion system. This is because a slow spacecraft would probably be passed by another mission sent later with more advanced propulsion. 
On the other hand, a case can therefore be made for starting a mission without delay, because the non-propulsion problems may turn out to be more difficult than the propulsion engineering.
Intergalactic travel involves distances about a million-fold greater than interstellar distances, making it radically more difficult than even interstellar travel. 
Andrew Kennedy has shown that voyages undertaken before the minimum "wait time" will be overtaken by those who leave at the minimum, while those who leave after the minimum will never overtake those who left at the minimum. 
Kennedy's calculation depends on r, the mean annual increase in world power production. From any point in time to a given destination, there is a minimum to the total time to destination. Voyagers would probably arrive without being overtaken by later voyagers by waiting a time t before leaving. The relation between the time it takes to get to a destination (now, T, or after waiting, T, and growth in velocity of travel is
Taking a journey to Barnard's Star, six light years away, as an example, Kennedy shows that with a world mean annual economic growth rate of 1.4% and a corresponding growth in the velocity of travel, the quickest human civilization might get to the star is in 1,110 years from the year 2007.
Astronomical distances are often measured in the time it would take a beam of light to travel between two points ("see light-year"). Light in a vacuum travels approximately 300,000 kilometers per second or 186,000 miles per second.
The distance from Earth to the Moon is 1.3 light-seconds. With current spacecraft propulsion technologies, a craft can cover the distance from the Earth to the Moon in around eight hours (New Horizons). That means light travels approximately thirty thousand times faster than current spacecraft propulsion technologies. The distance from Earth to other planets in the Solar System ranges from three light-minutes to about four light-hours. Depending on the planet and its alignment to Earth, for a typical unmanned spacecraft these trips will take from a few months to a little over a decade. The distance to other stars is much greater. If the distance from Earth to Sun is scaled down to one meter, the distance to Alpha Centauri A would be 271 kilometers or about 169 miles.
The nearest known star to the Sun is Proxima Centauri, which is 4.23 light-years away. The fastest outward-bound spacecraft yet sent, Voyager 1, has covered 1/600th of a light-year in 30 years and is currently moving at 1/18,000th the speed of light. At this rate, a journey to Proxima Centauri would take 72,000 years. Of course, this mission was not specifically intended to travel fast to the stars, and current technology could do much better. The travel time could be reduced to a few millennia using solar sails, or to a century or less using nuclear pulse propulsion. 
Special relativity offers the possibility of shortening the travel time: if a starship with sufficiently advanced engines could reach velocities near the speed of light, relativistic time dilation would make the voyage much shorter for the traveller. However, it would still take many years of elapsed time as viewed by the people remaining on Earth. On returning to Earth, the travellers would find that far more time had elapsed on Earth than had for them (twin paradox).
Many problems would be solved if wormholes existed. General relativity does not rule them out, but so far as we know at present, they do not exist.
The round-trip delay time is the minimum time between a probe signal reaching Earth, and the probe getting instructions from Earth. Given that information can travel no faster than the speed of light, this is for the Voyager 1 about 32 hours, near Proxima Centauri it would be 8 years. Faster reactions would have to be programmed to be carried out automatically. Of course, in the case of a manned flight the crew can respond immediately to their observations. However, the round-trip delay time makes them not only extremely distant but, in terms of communication, extremely isolated from Earth. Another factor is the energy needed for interstellar communications to arrive reliably. Obviously, gas and particles would degrade signals (interstellar extinction), and there would be limits to the energy available to send the signal.
The mass of any craft capable of carrying humans would inevitably be substantially larger than that necessary for an unmanned interstellar probe. The vastly greater travel times involved would require a life support system. The first interstellar missions are unlikely to carry life forms.
There are 59 known stellar systems within 20 light years from the Sun, containing 81 visible stars. The following could be considered prime targets for interstellar missions: Radiation dangers would rule out any organic beings for an expedition to Sirius. In any event, it is hard to visualise any manned expeditions at all, given the probable journey times.
Perhaps the most likely time for interstellar travel would be when a star comes through our Oort cloud. We should get a good 10,000 years' warning of this, so could plan for the event in some detail. See Scholz's star for the last time one came through.
Existing and near-term astronomical technology is capable of finding planetary systems around these objects, increasing their potential for exploration.

Bloods Range

Bloods Range (or Blood's Range) is a mountain range in central Australia. It stretches roughly east to west across the border between the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It consists of several sets of hills, separated by valleys; the two main valleys are formed by the Hull and Docker Rivers. There are numerous ravines and gorges all throughout the hills. Bloods Range connects with the Petermann Ranges at its western end. In the centre are Mounts Harris (840 m) and Carruthers (1000 m), which are the highest peaks. Further east, the range splits into several branches, including the Rowley Range, McNichol's Range and the Pinyinna Range.
Bloods Range was given its name on 14 March 1874 by the explorer Ernest Giles, when he saw it from the top of Mount Curdie. He named it after the owner of an early pastoral station in South Australia, whose surname was "Blood". On 12 June 1889, Giles' second-in-command, W. H. Tietkins, returned on his own expedition and surveyed the range. He named the two highest peaks Mount Harris and Mount Carruthers. From the top of Mount Harris, he wrote that he could see Kata Tjuṯa, the Petermann Ranges and the Tomkinson Ranges.

Transplant (surgery)

Transplants are a type of surgery. Both tissues and organs can be transplanted. Types of transplant:
An organ transplant is a kind of surgery where the person being operated on needs an organ replaced, and gets a healthy one from someone else, a donor. Usually the organ is taking from someone is recently deceased, except for organs like bone marrow or kidneys which can be given without harming the donor too much.
The critical problem with all transplants is transplant rejection by the host's immune system. Unless the host and donor are a very close genetic match, the host's immune system will reject the transplant. To stop this happening, drugs are used to suppress the host's immune system. This in turn makes the host more vulnerable to various kinds of infection.
To keep this problem to a minimum, transplants are only done when surgeons are satisfied that the host and donor are a fairly close match. Tests are done to see how good a match the donor's organ of tissue is to the proposed host.

Cannabis use is easy to detect using urine testing, hair analysis and breath. There are some ways to cheat such a test using synthetic urine or human hair - making blood testing the most effective.
Unlike alcohol, Cannabis testing is time consuming, expensive and cannot give accurate time of consuming and level of intoxication.
The lack of good testing methods and universal intoxication level scale is an issue in the legality of cannabis debate, especially regarding intoxicated driving.

Decapitated are a Polish technical death metal band from Krosno. 
Decapitated was formed in 1996 by guitarist Wacław "Vogg" Kiełtyka, his brother drummer Witold "Vitek" Kiełtyka, and vocalist Wojciech "Sauron" Wąsowicz when they were all in their teens. Bassist Marcin "Martin" Rygiel joined the band a year later and they released their first demo, "Cemeterial Gardens", in 1997 as well as their second demo, "The Eye of Horus", in 1998.
The band released their debut album, "Winds of Creation" on April 11, 2000. The album was well-received and their second studio album "Nihility" was released on February 19, 2002. Decapitated was chosen to perform at the Polish Ozzfest event in late May. They released their third studio album "The Negation" on March 9, 2004 and it was produced by both Slawek and Vojtek Wieslawski.
Sauron quit the band in 2005 and was replaced by Adrian "Covan" Kowanek. The band recorded "Organic Hallucinosis" and released the album on February 7, 2006. It was their fourth studio album and first album with their new vocalist. Martin left the band sometime after to live with his family and to move to California.
On October 28, 2007, the band was involved in an automobile accident when their tour bus collided with a truck carrying wood in Gomel. Vitek and Covan were injured in the accident and Vitek died on November 2, 2007 in a Russian hospital from the injuries he sustained. Covan went into a coma and the band went on hiatus.
The band ended their hiatus after Vogg said that he was searching for a new drummer and vocalist. Vocalist Rafał Piotrowski, bassist Filip "Heinrich" Hałucha and drummer Kerim "Krimh" Lechner all joined the band in 2009.
They recorded their fifth studio album "Carnival Is Forever" and released it on July 12, 2011. Heinrich left the band after to concentrate on his other band Vesania. Lechner left the band in September 2012 and was replaced by Paweł Jaroszewicz.

Public journal (official gazette, official journal, or official diary) is the daily record of the work of an official public organization, especially of legislatures of countries and/or its administrative divisions.
Journals of this sort are also often called gazettes (state or government newspapers).
In some countries, the publication in the official journal is a condition for a law to "come into effect" or "come into force" (in which the law becomes a reality), so that people know the law (or treaty) exists, which generally releases it into the public domain. But sometimes a public journal is not always released into the public domain.

Amidah

The Amidah (, "standing") is one of the two main prayers of Judaism. It has that name because people say it standing up. Jews say it at every prayer service of the year.
It is also called "Shemoneh Esrei" (, "eighteen") because at first the weekday version of the prayer had eighteen blessings. (It now has nineteen.) In the Talmud, it is called "Tefilah" (). This simply means "prayer". It has that name because it is so central to Judaism.
The Amidah always has three sections. 
The Amidah is said at least three times every day: at the morning, afternoon and evening prayer services. A person should say it standing. A person should say it loud enough to hear it. But it should be quiet enough that other people cannot hear it.
At the morning and afternoon services, the Amidah is repeated out loud by the prayer leader. When the Amidah is said out loud:
The Amidah is not said out loud at night.
In Reform Judaism the Amidah is not said quietly. It is said out loud at every prayer service.
On Shabbat and important Jewish holidays, the Amidah prayer changes in two important ways.
There are two Amidah prayers during the year that are different from any others. See the pages on these holidays for more information.
A "siddur" (Jewish prayer book) is always the best reference for information about Jewish prayers. 
is a very good English/Hebrew siddur to use for learning about prayers.

Visual novel

A visual novel is a type of video game. They use mostly static (non-moving) graphics, and usually have anime/manga-styled art. Sometimes they contain video footage. Almost all visual novels are produced in Japan, very few of these are ever sold in the Western market. Examples of popular visual novels are Kanon, Clannad, and Air.
Visual novels are different from other types of video games in that there is not much gameplay, most of the time the player clicks the screen to move through the game, and occasionally choices will come up for the player to make, which will determine what happens in the game. Most visual novels have more than one storyline and ending, the gameplay has been compared to "Choose Your Own Adventure" books.
Many visual novels are centered around drama, particularly themes involving romance or family, but visual novels centered around science fiction, fantasy fiction, and horror fiction are not uncommon.
Many visual novels have sexual or pornographic scenes in the game, even if they are not the whole purpose of the story.

Appalachian English

Appalachian English is a dialect of the English language. It is spoken in the Appalachian Mountains region. Research suggests it is one of the most unique dialects in the United States. Since the 1930s, a lot of research has been done to figure out where the dialect came from. One theory is that the dialect is a remnant of Elizabethan (or Shakespearean) English that had been preserved by the region's isolation. Another theory suggests that the dialect developed out of the Scots-Irish and Anglo-Scottish border dialects brought to the region by some of its earliest British Isles settlers. Recent research suggests that Appalachian English developed as a uniquely American dialect as early settlers re-adapted the English language to their unfamiliar frontier environment. This is supported by many similarities between the Appalachian dialect and Colonial American English.

Carnaval

Carnaval, Op. 9, is a work for piano solo by Robert Schumann. It was written in 1834-1835. Subtitled "Scènes mignonnes sur quatre notes" (Little Scenes on Four Notes). the work is a collection of short pieces representing masked revelers at a festival. Schumann, his friends and colleagues, and characters from improvised Italian comedy ("commedia dell’arte") are all depicted musically in the work. "Carnaval" is centered on four notes which had special meaning for Schumann: A, E-flat, C, B - signified in German as A-S-C-H. Each piece has a title, and the work as a whole is a musical representation of an elaborate masked ball during carnival season. Both Schumann and his wife, Clara, thought his solo piano works too difficult for the general public. They were rarely performed in Schumann's lifetime. Franz Liszt however performed selections from "Carnaval" in Leipzig in 1840. Today, the work is one of Schumann's most often performed works. The work was orchestrated in the early 20th century for a ballet produced for the Ballets Russes which starred Nijinsky.

Symphony No. 1 &quot;Spring&quot; (Schumann)

Symphony No. 1 in B flat major, Op. 38 ("Spring") is the first of Robert Schumann's four symphonies. It was written early 1841. Schumann sketched the symphony in four days from 23 January to 26 January. He completed the orchestration by 20 February. The premiere took place under the direction of Felix Mendelssohn on 31 March 1841 in Leipzig. The symphony was well received. Schumann was largely known for his piano works and for songs at the time. His wife Clara Schumann encouraged him to write symphonic music. Schumann said he was inspired by his "Liebesfrühling" (spring of love) in the symphony's composition. 
The work has four movements: Andante un poco maestoso – Allegro molto vivace (B flat major); Larghetto (E flat major; Scherzo: Molto vivace – Trio I: Molto piu vivace – Trio II (G minor); and Allegro animato e grazioso (B flat major). The orchestration is for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani, triangle and strings. Schumann expanded the use of the timpani in this piece. He made some revisions in the work until the definitive edition was published in 1853.

Annual percentage rate

The term annual percentage rate (APR), also called nominal APR, and the term effective APR, means the interest rate for a whole year, rather than just a monthly fee/rate, as applied on a loan, mortgage loan, or credit card. This rate is useful when buying a car, a house, or any other expensive possession. Since few people are able to afford to pay the full price, many sellers choose to divide the price into monthly payments and a down payment. This makes things easier to buy. Once the buyer pays the down payment, he or she enters into an agreement to pay the remaining months. But since the buyer has not paid the entire amount yet, the seller is essentially lending part of the purchase to the buyer. This is where interest rates come in. The seller charges the monthly payments with a part or a percentage of the remaining amount. This amount gets added onto the monthly payment. Some companies force the buyer to pay the interest first, and the remaining amount pays the original loaned amount, called the principal.

Donkey Kong Jungle Beat

Donkey Kong Jungle Beat is a platform video game for the Nintendo GameCube game console. It was released in Japan on December 16, 2004, in Europe on February 4, 2005, and in North America on March 14, 2005. It is played with the DK Bongos controller.
The game involves combat, platforming, and counterattacking (attacking enemies after they attack you). Players use the left drum to move left, the right drum to move right, and both drums to jump. Clapping or hitting the sides of the drums causes Donkey Kong to clap. Clapping produces a small small red ring and a bigger green one. Enemies that are in the red ring are usually defeated, and those that are in the green ring are usually stunned. Stunned enemies can be killed by jumping on them and hitting the drums repeatedly. The goal is not just to get to the end of the level, but also to get as many "beats" (points) as the player can. Beats are gotten by grabbing bananas, and lost by being hit or falling. More beats can be gotten by doing combos while grabbing bananas.
The level system involves several "kingdoms." Each kingdom has three platforming levels. At the end of each kingdom is a boss. There are four species of bosses. Each species of boss has different fighting styles and ways of defeating. After a boss is defeated, the number of beats is counted, and the player earns a crest depending on how many were gotten. The crests are as follows:
In 2008 and 2009, "Donkey Kong Jungle Beat" was one of the games released as part of the "New Play Control!" series of remade Nintendo GameCube games for the Wii. It features new and changed levels along with more traditional controls that use the analog stick to move and the A button to jump.

Star Fox: Assault

"Star Fox: Assault" has three types of gameplay: Arwing gameplay, Landmaster gameplay, and on foot gameplay. Arwing gameplay is similar to "Star Fox" and "Star Fox 64", where players guide Fox McCloud's Arwing spacecraft through stages. The player shoots down enemies and has to defend their teammates. Power-ups are placed on stages to help the player. In some stages, the player may hop out of the Arwing. In Landmaster gameplay, the player guides a tank called the Landmaster. Players shoot or run over enemies, and help their teammates when they need help. On foot gameplay is similar to a traditional third-person shooter video game. The player starts with a blaster, a type of gun, and they can get stronger weapons such as machine guns and sniper rifles.
Multiplayer can be played with up to four players. Players can play on foot or in a vehicle. New characters, weapons, items, and maps can be unlocked as the player plays the game.

Ice core

An ice core is a long piece of ice taken from a glacier. The ice is drilled very deep, so that the ice core goes back to old ice at the bottom of the glacier. Usually, ice cores are taken from Antarctica, Greenland or very high mountains.
Snow falls on ground and accumulates (gets deeper). As more snow falls, the bottom layers get compacted (thinner) because of the weight on top. In the end, only ice remains, and all air goes away. The deeper the ice, the older it is. Ice cores can be dated by looking at the layers: often every season can be seen in the ice core because it forms a layer. At other times it is more difficult to find out how old the ice is. Other methods can be used, like measuring conductivity or making mathematical models.
Scientists study ice cores to find out how the climate was in the past. The ice keeps information like gases, particles, ash from volcanoes. The type of water that forms the ice can be used to calculate the temperature of Earth.
Ice cores help us know what the temperature was on the planet in the past 800 thousand years. We know more about ice ages that happen periodically. This is a helpful addition to our knowledge about global warming.

Milutin Milanković

Milutin Milanković 28 May 1879 – 12 December 1958) was a Serbian mathematician, astronomer, geophysicist, climatologist, civil engineer and writer. Milanković made two fundamental contributions to science. 
The first contribution was the "Canon of the Earth’s insolation", which explained the climates of the planets of the Solar system. He founded cosmic climatology by calculating temperatures of the upper layers of the Earth's atmosphere as well as the temperature conditions on planets of the inner Solar system, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and the Moon, as well as the depth of the atmosphere of the outer planets. 
The second contribution was his explanation of how the Earth's long-term climate changes are caused by changes in Earth's spin and orbit around the Sun. This is now known as Milankovich cycles. This explains the ice ages which occurred in the geological past of the Earth, and predicts climate changes on the Earth which may be expected in the future. 
The explanation is not entirely accurate, so no doubt there are other factors also at work. These other factors would be such things as how much oxygen and carbon dioxide are in the atmosphere, the position of the continents, the amount of volcanic action, and so on. However, the cycles of climate do seem broadly to go as Milankovic predicted. Geological evidence from rhythmical features in sedimentary rocks are common.

The game features three pinball tables. Each table has three floors. The player earns points by bouncing off of walls and bumpers, and by defeating enemies. Players can also earn Maxim Tomatoes, which stops the player from losing a ball for a short amount of time. On the middle and top floors is a Warp Star. If the player takes the Warp Star on the middle floor, the player can play a minigame to earn extra points and multipliers. The Warp Star on the top floor takes the player to the boss of the table. After defeating a boss, the player can earn another life by spelling out the word "Extra" with the letters that appear on the table selection screen. After the player plays all three tables, they face against King Dedede. Defeating King Dedede allows the player to play the tables again for a higher score.

Educational psychology

Educational psychology is a branch of psychology. It has ancient roots, but was mostly developed in the 20th century. It has two "faces", the scientific and the humanistic.
Education as an objective science was strongly promoted around 1900 by Alfred Binet and Edward Thorndike. Binet it was who invented the first intelligence tests, and they were extended and promoted in English by Louis Terman. Binet's ideas were sympathetic to Thorndike, who was above all interested in turning psychology into a real science by research, measurement and empirical evidence. The arrival of World War I caused a huge conscription of men into the fighting services. Sorting out men of all types was an urgent problem. The intelligence tests proved to be very useful at helping get the right men into the right jobs. Not surprisingly, the use of IQ tests continued in education, where a similar problem of sorting out occurs in unselected public school enrollments.
The other way to look at educational psychology is to notice that a child is a growing person. Unlike most adults, the child is open to influence. Education does change a child. The emphasis on the child as a growing person is typical of humanistic psychology. It has many supporters, especially at primary school level. Examples of educators whose interest was humanistic include Johann Pestalozzi, Maria Montessori, John Dewey, and Jean Piaget. This type of approach is called "child-centered" education.
How these two approaches are balanced varies in different countries. Many countries have arrangements for certified psychologists to inluence schools and help children.
These posts are now called 'educational and child psychology' in the United Kingdom. Since a training overhaul in 2006, there is a 3-year taught doctorate similar to that of clinical psychology. In the United States it is still called school psychology. Educational and child psychology is the practice of applied psychology with children and families in the context of education and is usually based within a government local authority.

It was based on the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty in England. Local campaigns to conserve native bushland and save old buildings were the forces that led to the first Australian national trusts in New South Wales in 1947, South Australia in 1955 and Victoria in 1956. They were followed later by Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland.

Talgai is an archaeological site, near Allora on the Darling Downs, south east of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In 1884 a Pleistocene era skull was found in Dalrymple Creek after a big flood. It was found by William Naish, a shearer, who was building a fence at the East Talgai station. The skull was that of a 14 year old boy who had lived about 11,000 years ago. Naish gave the skull to the owners of the station. It was purchased by the University of Sydney in 1914. It was the first fossil found which showed the early human occupation of Australia.
The skull was heavily encrusted with calcium carbonate and the shape had been distorted during long time buried in the ground. At first scientists thought it was a primitive skull with ape like teeth. Later study showed that the skull was a modern Homo sapien, the teeth were normal, but heavily worn. The boy had a massive injury to the side of his skull which was probably what had killed him.
In 1968 a Tom Haydon made a documentary movie, "The Talgai Skull: An Investigation Into the Origin of the Australian Aborigines". It won the Australian Film Institute award for Best Documentary.

Woodhenge

Woodhenge is a Neolithic henge and timber circle monument near Stonehenge. It is part of the UNESCO Stonehenge World Heritage Site in Wiltshire, north-east of Stonehenge.
Woodhenge was identified in 1925 by an aerial archaeology survey.
The structure was probably built during the period of the Beaker culture. This spanned both the late Neolithic and Britain's early Bronze Age.
The ditch has been dated to between 2470 and 2000 BC, which would be about the same time as, or slightly later than, construction of the stone circle at Stonehenge. The timber monument was probably earlier. Radiocarbon dating of artifacts shows that the site was still in use around 1800 BC.
The site consists of six concentric oval rings of post holes, the outermost being about wide. They are surrounded first by a single flat-bottomed ditch, deep and up to wide, and finally by an outer bank, about wide and high. With an overall diameter measuring , the site had a single entrance to the northeast.
At the center of the rings, was a crouched inhumation of a child, which Cunnington interpreted as a dedicatory sacrifice. After excavation, the remains were taken to London, where they were destroyed during the Blitz, making further examination impossible. Cunnington also found a crouched inhumation of a teenager in a grave dug in the Eastern section of the ditch, opposite the entrance.
Most of the 168 post holes held wooden posts, although Cunnington found evidence that a pair of standing stones may have been placed between the second and third post hole rings. Recent excavations in 2006 have indicated that there were, in fact, at least five standing stones on the site, arranged in a "cove". The deepest post holes measured up to – and are believed to have held posts which reached as high as above ground. Those posts would have weighed up to 5 tons, and their arrangement was similar to that of the bluestones at Stonehenge. The positions of the postholes are currently marked with modern concrete posts – a simple and informative method of displaying the site.
Further comparisons with Stonehenge were quickly noticed by Cunnington – both have entrances oriented approximately to the midsummer sunrise, and the diameters of the timber circles at Woodhenge and the stone circles at Stonehenge are similar.
Simple tracings were made of Maud Cunnington's and Professor Alexander Thom's plans of Woodhenge, which when folded to find its major axis of symmetry indicated that the monument may be aligned on the moon. A GPS survey made in 2008 produced the same result.
Over 40 years after the discovery of Woodhenge, another timber circle of comparable size was discovered in 1966. Known as the Southern Circle, inside of what came to be known as the Durrington Walls henge enclosure, only north of Woodhenge.
It is likely that the timbers were freestanding, rather than part of a roofed structure. For many years work on the study of Stonehenge had overshadowed any real breakthroughs in the understanding of Woodhenge. Ongoing investigations are part of the Stonehenge Riverside Project.
Theories have emerged in which the sites may all be integrated into an overall layout, in which the structures were linked by roads, and which incorporated the natural features of the River Avon. One suggestion is that the use of wood vs. stone may have held a special significance in the beliefs and practices involving the transformation between life and death.

Tokyo Metropolis

It is the capital city and a prefecture of Japan on the island of Honshu.
Greater Tokyo includes land in the Kantō region and also the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands.
Ten percent (10%) of the Japanese people live in Tokyo, and as many as twenty percent (20%) of the population live around it. As of 2007, the population was 12,790,000.
Tokyo is in a part of Japan called the Kantō Plain. Two big rivers run through Tokyo. One is the Arakawa River which runs from the north to the south, and flows into Tokyo Bay. The other is the Tama River which runs from the west to the east. The Tama River is a border between Tokyo and its neighbor city, Kawasaki.
In 1943, Tokyo prefecture's municipalities and city of Tokyo were associated in a special way. The administration of Tokyo city merged with the administration of Tokyo Prefecture. Tokyo Metropolis is governed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.
Tokyo has many outlying islands.
The Izu Islands include Izu Ōshima, Toshima, Niijima, Shikinejima, Kozushima, Miyakejima, Mikurajima, Hachijojima, and Aogashima.
The Ogasawara Islands include Chichi-jima, Nishinoshima, Haha-jima, Kita Iwo Jima, Iwo Jima, and Minami Iwo Jima. Minami Torishima, the easternmost point in Japan, is also part of the Ogasawaras. Okinotorishima, the southernmost point in Japan, is also administered by Tokyo as part of this group.
Tokyo is the cultural, business, and political center of the country. It is also the center of many transport systems. There are many air, rail, sea, and road links in and out of the city. Local subway and bus systems serve every part of the city.
Two commercial airports serve Tokyo. Haneda Airport is in the city limits next to Tokyo Bay. This airport is mostly for domestic travel. Most international flights to and from Tokyo go through Narita International Airport in Chiba Prefecture, opened in 1978.
Tokyo has a busy international and domestic port, but more traffic goes through the nearby port of Yokohama. There are domestic ferries to the islands of Tokyo, but also to other parts of the country such as Hokkaido.

Ring of Brodgar

The Ring of Brodgar is a Neolithic henge and stone circle on Mainland, the largest island in Orkney, Scotland. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the Heart of Neolithic Orkney.
The stone circle is in diameter, and the third largest in the British Isles. The ring originally comprised 60 stones, of which only 27 remained standing at the end of the 20th century. The tallest stones stand at the south and west of the ring. 
The stones are set in a circular ditch up to deep, wide and in circumference that was carved out of the solid sandstone bedrock by the ancient residents. Technically, this ditch does not constitute a true henge as there is no sign of an encircling bank of earth and rock. However, many archaeologists refer to this structure as a henge. Aubrey Burl classifies the ditch as a Class II henge; one that has two opposing entrances, in this case on the north-west and south-east.
The Ring is in a significant ritual landscape. Within there are the two circle-henges, four chambered tombs, groups of standing stones, single stones, barrows, cairns, and mounds. A number of flint arrowheads and broken stone mace-heads were found nearby. They seem to date from the Bronze Age. The nearby Standing Stones of Stenness and its Maeshowe tomb help to make the Ring of Brodgar a site of major importance.

Gliese 581

Gliese 581 is an M-class red dwarf star that is not far from the Earth. It is 22 light years away from the Solar system. This makes it the 89th closest known star to the Sun. It is also known as HO Librae, GL 581, or GJ 581. 
Astronomers have discovered some planets that orbit Gliese 581. The astronomers agree that four of the planets are real, but some think there are two more planets.
Gliese 581 has a radius, and mass, about a third that of the Sun. Its estimated temperature is 3,498 Kelvin (4125 Celsius, 7457 Fahrenheit). Its luminosity is 0.01205 times the luminosity of the Sun.
People on Earth can see Gliese 581 in the constellation Libra. The star's apparent magnitude is 10.57. This means that a person on Earth would need to use a telescope to see Gliese 581, because the star is not bright enough for the naked eye to see.
In the 2005, scientists found a planet orbiting Gliese 581. The scientists, led by Stephen Vogt, used a method called Doppler spectroscopy to find the planet and some facts about the planet. They said that the planet, named Gliese 581b, has a size close to the size of Neptune (the eighth planet in our solar system). They found that 581b weighs 16.6 times as much as the Earth, and that its orbit around GL 581 lasts for 5.366 days.
After this study was published, more scientists started to look for other planets that orbit Gliese 581. In the 2007, another group of astronomers said that they found two more planets. These two planets were named 581c and 581d. For planet c, the scientists measured a mass of 5.06 times the Earth's mass. They found that the planet's orbit lasts for 12.931 days. For planet d, they found a mass of 8.3 times the Earth's mass, and an orbit time of 83.4 days.
In 2009, the first group of astronomers found a fourth planet, named 581e. They measured the planet's mass to be 1.94 times the mass of the Earth, and measured the planet's orbit to be 3.149 days long. The astronomers also studied planet 581d again, and made more accurate measurements for that planet. They found that the planet has a mass that is 7.09 times the Earth's mass, and that its orbit lasts for 66.8 days.
Vogt's group of astronomers said that they have found two more planets orbiting Gliese 581, named 581f and 581g. They published their findings in 2010. For planet 581f, they found a mass of 7.0 Earth masses and an orbit length of 433 days. For the other new planet, 581g, the group measured a mass that was 3.1 times the mass of the Earth and an orbit that was 36.6 days long.
After the Vogt group published their report on the fifth and sixth planets, some other astronomers published opposing results. In 2012, these other scientists said that planets 581f and 581g did not actually exist. Their report stated that the Vogt group's new findings were false positives. They looked at the original Doppler spectroscopy data again, and found no signs of the two new planets.
However, the Vogt group published even more research that supported the two new planets. Later in 2012, they studied new Doppler spectroscopy experiments and found stronger signs of planets 581f and 581g. They also simulated the two orbit models that the two groups of scientists have proposed. Vogt's group found that the proposed system with four planets was unstable, meaning that if there were only four planets orbiting Gliese 581, the system would have broken a long time ago. On the other hand, they said that the system with six planets was much more stable.
Today, there is still no consensus about whether or not planets 581f or 581g exist.
Two orbit models for the Gliese 581 system are being considered currently. An orbit model is a scientific model that astronomers create as a hypothesis of how a star's planets go through their orbits. One has four planets with eccentric orbits, and the other has six planets with circular orbits.
In the first model, some scientists propose that only the four planets 581b, 581c, 581d, and 581e orbit Gliese 581. None of the planets orbits in a circle. Instead, their paths around the star are ellipses.
In the second model, the six planets 581b through 581g orbit around Gliese 581. Here, each planet has a circular orbit around the host star.
In November 2012, scientists at the European Space Agency said that they found a belt of comets orbiting around Gliese 581. Our solar system has a similar comet belt called the Kuiper belt.
Astronomers think that Gliese 581's habitable zone goes from approximately 0.05 AU (astronomical units) to 0.24 AU away from the star. This means that planets orbiting between these distances could be the right temperature to let organic life (life as we know it on Earth) survive.
If the six-planet model is correct, then at least two of the planets might be habitable. In other words, humans might be able to live there. In this model, the planet 581d orbits at the outside edge of Gliese 581's habitable zone, and the planet 581g orbits in the middle of the habitable zone. If the atmosphere on 581g is like Earth's atmosphere, the planet's temperature would be between 236 and 261 Kelvin (-37 and -12 Celsius, -35 and 10 Fahrenheit). This is only a little lower than Earth's temperature.
Even though these two planets might be the right temperature for life to live, other issues could make their environments hostile. Planet 581g might be stuck in an orbit resonance, where the planet spins at the same rate that it orbits around the star. This would mean that one side of the planet always faces the star, just like the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth. If this is the case, the side that faces the star would be too hot for people to live, while the other side would be too cold. Planet 581d might also be caught in an orbit resonance.

<doc id="393605" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=393605" title="EPR paradox">
EPR paradox

The EPR paradox is an early and strong criticism of quantum mechanics. Albert Einstein and his co-workers, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, said that Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and the other scientists in Copenhagen were wrong about uncertainty. Heisenberg claimed that you could never know, for any one time, both the position and momentum (or velocity, or trajectory) of any atom-sized or smaller particle. The idea was that the two could not be measured at the same time, and that as soon as one was measured a change would occur and you would not get the same answer for the other one that you would have gotten if you had measured it first. Einstein and his group said that Heisenberg should think again. Suppose you had two very small particles. You measured the weight of each of them and then stuck them together. You gave them a little push. Then something broke them apart. They should have both positions and velocities that were related. So if you measured the position of one of them, then even if you assumed that Heisenberg was right and you could not involve messing up its velocity in the process of measuring it, surely that did not mean that it never had a definite velocity. For proof, Einstein said that you could next measure the velocity of the second particle and, since everything was mathematically related, you would then know the velocity of the first particle. 
There was one way that Heisenberg could be right, a reason that Einstein thought was nonsense: What if measuring the position of the first particle would mess up the velocity of the second particle. That would be like magic. How could anybody explain such an influence? Suppose that the two particles were moving away very fast and a long time had gone by. If something that happened to the first particle somehow influenced the second particle, its influence would have to travel faster than the speed of light, which is impossible. Physicists like Erwin Schrödinger suggested that maybe the relationship in position and velocity would just gradually go away somehow. Schrödinger called the connection between the two particles (and anything like it that happened to other things) "entanglement." 
"Spooky action at a distance," as Einstein called it, is one way of understanding this paradox. Einstein had no way of knowing that future experiments would show that entanglement exists. In the end, John Stewart Bell showed mathematically that there is no way that hidden variables could account for experimental results that show entanglement.

Soakage

A soakage, or soak, is a source of water in the deserts of Australia. It is called a soak because the water generally soaks into the sandy ground, and is stored below. They sometimes form part of an ephemeral river or drainage system. Soakages were traditionally important sources of water for Aboriginal people in the desert, because they are the most reliable sources in times of drought. Knowing the exact location of each soakage was very valuable knowledge. In the 19th century, the explorers Peter Warburton and David Carnegie wrote that they had chased down Aboriginal people with camels and captured and chained them to force them to reveal their secret sources of water.

Wuhan

Wuhan () is the capital of Hubei province, People's Republic of China, and is the city with most people in Central China. It is at the east of the Jianghan Plain, where the Yangtze and Han rivers meet. Joining three nearby cities, Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang, Wuhan is a center of transportation, with many railways, roads and expressways passing through. Because of its important role in transportation, Wuhan was sometimes called the "Chicago of China." It is also recognized as the political, economic, financial, cultural, and educational center of central China. 
The city of Wuhan, first called so in 1927, has 10,020,000 people (as at 2011). In the 1920s, Wuhan was the national capital of a Kuomintang (KMT) government led by Wang Jingwei when he was against Chiang Kai-shek, and it was also the capital in 1937.

Mantarur

Mantarur is a hilly area in the southwest of the Northern Territory, Australia. It forms the southeastern end of the Olia Chain of mountains. This outcrop includes Butler's Dome (; 1102 metres above sea level). The granite escarpment called Foster's Cliff is nearby to the east. Mantarur is located about southwest of Kata Tjuṯa. It is on Pitjantjatjara land, part of the Petermann Aboriginal Land Trust. A family outstation was established here in the 1980s, at a rockhole in the western slopes. It has since been abandoned.
Frank Rees George led a prospecting expedition through the area between 1905 and 1906. George gave names to several of the landforms, including Butler's Dome, which is believed to have been named after Richard Butler, who was a minister of South Australia. He named Foster's Cliff after R. W. Foster, the South Australian Commissioner of Public Works. The expedition found traces of gold at Foster's Cliff, but not enough of it to warrant mining. It was the only place in the Petermann Ranges found to contain any gold.

The Olia Chain (or The Olias) is a mountain range in the southwest of the Northern Territory, Australia. It forms the southeastern end of the Petermann Ranges, and connects these ranges with the Musgrave Ranges further south. The Olia Chain consists of scattered outcrops of rocky hills, separated and surrounded by sandy plains. It extends from Katamala Cone (828 m) at its northern end to Mantarur (including Butler's Dome, 1102 m) in the south. The centre of the chain is dominated by Stevenson Peak (1025 m). A few kilometres northeast of this peak is a Pitjantjatjara outstation, called Pirrulpakalarintja.
The Olia Chain mostly consist of flat-topped ridges composed of sandstone, slate, quartzite, and limestone rock beds.

Star Fox Adventures is an action-adventure video game for the Nintendo GameCube game console. It was developed by Rare and published by Nintendo. It was released in North America on September 23, 2002, in Japan on September 27, 2002, and in Europe on November 22, 2002. It was Rare's last game for a Nintendo console before they were bought by Microsoft as a developer for their Xbox console. The plot centers around Fox McCloud restoring the remote Dinosaur Planet by finding pieces that have broken off of it.
Unlike other "Star Fox" games, "Star Fox Adventures" plays as an action-adventure game similar to "". Instead of a blaster, Fox uses a staff as his weapon. Fox can find power-ups for his staff that allow it to fire projectiles, freeze enemies, and reach areas that he cannot reach on his own. Fox cannot jump unless he runs off of something, in the same way that Link jumps in "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time".

Railgun

A railgun is a gun that fires metal projectiles (bullets) using a magnetic field produced by electricity. Unlike conventional guns, it does not use brass casings or gunpowder, and rarely needs to be cleaned or unjammed. Currently most railguns are experimental and are not used in war yet, but the U.S. Army is expecting to create one for war within the next few decades. In theory, a railgun could fire a bowling-ball-sized projectile fast enough to destroy a small building, even over long distances. Railguns are usually very large and not portable because of the need for a large power supply. There have been proposals to use the same technology for non-weapon purposes, such as aircraft and spacecraft launchers and specialized tools.

<doc id="393673" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=393673" title="Katiti Aboriginal Land Trust">
Katiti Aboriginal Land Trust

The Katiti Aboriginal Land Trust is a land trust for a block of land in the southwest of the Northern Territory, Australia. It was created through the Katiti Land Claim in 1980. The trust's owners include Pitjantjatjara, Yankunytjatjara and Luritja people. The block of land is officially referred to as Northern Territory Portion 1818. It borders the larger Petermann Land Trust area and Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park to the north and west, and two pastoral stations to the east and south: Curtin Springs and Mulga Park. The town of Yulara is excluded from the Land Trusts, and sits between the Katiti block and Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park.
The trust is named after Katiti (), a natural spring located about south of Lake Amadeus. This spring was first written about by Baldwin Spencer and Francis James Gillen. They visited it in 1894 on their way to Uluṟu, and recorded the name "Kurtitina" (more accurately, ""). The prospecting expedition led by Lawrence Wells visited the spring in 1903, and Herbert Basedow marked it on his maps as "Curtyteena".
Before the 1970s, the area of land now held by the Katiti ALT was considered crown land by the government. The region to the southwest had been declared an Aboriginal reservation in 1920. An area of land around Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa had been made into the Ayers Rock–Mt Olga National Park in 1958. The Katiti block, however, was considered unused. In 1976, the Australian Federal Government passed the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. This law allowed Aboriginal communities to claim ownership of unused land, and to be granted freehold title to that land if they could show that they had a historical association with it. Section 4 of the act gave the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs the power to establish Land Trusts to look after the title.
The Katiti Land Claim was formally submitted in 1979. The claim was for a larger area than what is held by the Trust today, and included the Ayers Rock–Mt Olga National Park. It was sumbitted by the Central Land Council on the behalf of several hundred people, most of whom lived at Muṯitjulu. The people were granted legal ownership to the block of land now held by the Katiti ALT on 30 September 1980. They were not granted the title to Ayers Rock–Mt Olga because it was already being used as a national park. They were, however, recognised as the park's traditional owners (""). Also excluded from the property granted were a area surrounding the resort town of Yulara, and a area covering the Petermann Road, which provided tourist access to Uluṟu.
Petermann Road was later replaced by the Lasseter Highway, and the government transferred the title to the old road to the Katiti ALT on 23 February 1990. Legal ownership over the national park's land was eventually granted to its traditional owners in 1985, and the title to this area is held by the Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa Aboriginal Land Trust. Ownership of the Yulara area was the subject of a court case, which ended in 2006.

Mount Currie is a mountain in the southwest of the Northern Territory, Australia. It is about above sea level. It is part of the same line of conglomerate hills that includes Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa. These three formations have very similar compositions. The sheet of conglomerate that is shared by all three is called Mount Currie Conglomerate.
The peak was named Mount Currie by the explorer William H. Tietkens, who led an expedition through the area in 1889. He named the peak from a distance, and did not actually approach it. The first White explorers to reach Mount Currie were the Mackay Expedition in June 1926, which was led by Donald Mackay and Herbert Basedow.

2013 Boston Marathon bombings

The Boston Marathon bombings were a terrorist attack that happened during the 2013 Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013 in Boston, Massachusetts. At 2:49 PM EDT, two bombs exploded thirteen seconds apart near the finish line. Three people were killed and an estimated 264 people were injured. The windows of stores near the explosions were broken, and a window on the third floor of the Boston Public Library, across the street from the site of one of the explosions, was damaged.
At the time of the first explosion, the clock at the finish line showed a time of 04:09:43. This was within minutes of the time that the most runners were crossing the finish line during the 2012 Boston Marathon. The winning runners had crossed the finish line two hours earlier, and other runners were finishing. The remaining runners were directed away from the finish line.
The Federal Aviation Administration stopped all airplanes from departing Boston's Logan International Airport for almost two hours. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, Boston's transit system, had some service shut down after the bombings.
In response to the bombings, security was increased in New York City. Counter-terrorism vehicles were sent to landmark sites in the city. Security was increased at Times Square, hotels, and other places. Security was also increased in Washington D.C., where the White House was partially evacuated. Pennsylvania Avenue was closed off by the United States Secret Service. In Chicago, all of the city's most important streets and buildings were also closed and inspected.
Barack Obama, the President of the United States, addressed the nation several hours after the bombings. He said that while the people behind the bombings were still not known, the government would "get to the bottom of this.", and that those people would feel "the full weight of justice." The President addressed the nation again the next day. He later described the bombings as an act of terrorism, saying that "Any times bombs are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror."
The day after the bombings, a moment of silence was held at the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and the New York Mercantile Exchange. Other events across the country also held moments of silence.
During a news conference on April 18, the Federal Bureau of Investigation released video and pictures of two possible suspects to the public, asking them to help identify the suspects in the video and pictures. The FBI reported that one of the men was seen placing a backpack at the scene of the bombings minutes before they happened.
On the evening of April 18, a shooting happened on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at 10:48 PM EDT. Multiple shots were fired. One police officer at the scene died after being shot multiple times. After killing the police officer, the suspects stole a silver Mercedes-Benz SUV in Cambridge. They forced the owner to use his ATM card to take out $800 in cash. They released him after the ATM reached its limit. The owner's cell phone was still in the car, allowing police to locate the suspects. Police exchanged gunfire with the two suspects in Watertown. One police officer was very badly hurt while exchanging gunfire with the suspects. "The Boston Globe" reported that the suspects were the same men that the FBI were looking for in the aftermath of the Marathon bombings. One of the suspects, 26-year old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died of his injuries. The other suspect, 19-year old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was "still at large," according to law enforcement officials. On the morning of April 19, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick asked the city of Boston to "shelter in place." This meant that people should stay inside and not open their doors to anyone other than police officers with proper identification cards. As a result, the entire transit system of Boston, as well as taxi service, was shut down.
Later that evening, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was taken into custody. He had hidden in a boat in the backyard of a property on 67 Franklin St. in Watertown and was spotted by a man checking on his boat. He was taken into custody alive, but very badly hurt after a standoff with police.
On April 22, Dzhokar was charged with using and planning to use a weapon of mass destruction to cause death and with destruction of property resulting in death. On May 15, 2015, a jury sentenced Dzhokhar to death by lethal injection.

Worm charming, worm grunting, and worm fiddling are methods of attracting earthworms out from the ground. It is usually done to collect bait for fishing, but it can also be a sport. Most worm charming methods involve vibrating the soil, which encourages the worms to the surface. One method involves twirling a steel pole in the ground, which moves the dirt, making the worms in the area go to the top of the ground.
The worm grunting capital of the world is Albuquerque, New Mexico. Every year on June 21, thousands of fishermen show up for the annual worm grunting festival.
The activity is usually performed to collect bait for fishing.

Cerebral aneurysm

Cerebral aneurysms, also called brain aneurysms, are a cerebrovascular issue in which weakness in the walls of a cerebral artery causes localized dilation or ballooning in the blood vessel. Small, unchanging aneurysms may produce very few symptoms. However, before a larger aneurysm ruptures, individuals may experience sudden or severe headaches, nausea, vomiting and vision problems. The rupture may also directly cause serious damage directly to the brain, usually from the bleeding itself-this is a hemorrhagic stroke that can lead to and may cause arm or leg weakness or paralysis and speech troubles. Cerebral aneurysms may result due to congenital defect, high blood pressure or head trauma. Onsets are sometimes sudden and without warning, and such ruptures are extremely dangerous and usually result in bleeding into the brain itself, leading to a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which then constitutes a stroke. This condition may lead to death or permanent disability for some individuals.

Museo Reina Sofía

Museo Reina Sofía is a museum in Madrid, Spain. Picasso's painting "Guernica" is there.
The Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía (MNCARS, also called the Museo Reina Sofía, Queen Sofia Museum, El Reina Sofia, or simply The Sofia) is Spain's national museum of 20th century art. The museum was officially inaugurated on September 10, 1992 and is named for Queen Sofia of Spain. It is located in Madrid, near the Atocha train and metro stations, at the southern end of the so-called Golden Triangle of Art (located along the Paseo del Prado and also comprising the Museo del Prado and the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza).
The museum is mainly dedicated to Spanish art. Highlights of the museum include excellent collections of Spain's two greatest 20th century masters, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The Reina Sofia Museum also hosts a free-access library specializing in art, with a collection of over 100,000 books, over 3,500 sound recordings and almost 1,000 videos.
The central building of the museum was once an 18th-century hospital. Extensive modern renovations and additions to the old building were made starting in 1980. In 1988, portions of the new museum were opened to the public, mostly in temporary configurations; that same year it was decreed by the Ministry of Culture as a national museum. Its architectural identity was radically changed in 1989 by Ian Ritchie (architect) with the addition of three glass circulation towers. A €92 million designed by French architect Jean Nouvel opened October 2005.
The building has been functioning as the Centro del Arte (Art Center) since 1986 but was established as the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in 1988. But analyzing the building's history up until these events, it appears that the building was subjected to being tested out as different representations of what it is today.

Globe Theatre

The Globe Theatre was a theme park in London associated with William Shakespeare. It was built in 1599 by Shakespeare's playing company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, on land owned by Thomas Brend. It could seat 3000 people and 1000 standing in the 'Yard'. The audience were a mixture of social classes, as Shakespeare tried to make his plays enjoyable for everyone, with the poorer people standing. 
It was destroyed by fire on 29 June 1613. A second Globe Theatre was built on the same site by June 1614 and closed in 1642.
While there are drawings of the outside of the theatre, historians do not really know what the inside of the Globe looked like. They have had to use written descriptions, details from the building contracts, drawings of other theatres, and clues in the plays written to be performed in the Globe. In 1989 an archaeological dig at the site showed that the building was in the shape of a polygon, with 20 sides. They also discovered the building was 100 feet in diameter.
A modern reconstruction of the Globe, named "Shakespeare's Globe", opened in 1997 about 750 feet (230 m) from the site of the original theatre. The rebuilding was a project started by an American actor, director and producer, Sam Wanamaker. He set up the Globe Theatre Trust, and spent years raising money and researching so that the theatre could be built. He died before the new Globe was finished.

<doc id="393870" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=393870" title="Ancient Greek sculpture">
Ancient Greek sculpture

Ancient Greek sculpture is the sculpture of Ancient Greece. There are three major stages. Sculpture was used to show the battles, mythology, and rulers of the area known as Ancient Greece.
The Greeks began again to carve in stone as they came out of their Dark Age. They were inspired by the large stone sculptures of Mesopotamia and Egypt. Free-standing figures share the solidity and front-facing stance of their Eastern models. However, their style is more dynamic than those of Egyptian sculpture. This is clear in the "Lady of Auxerre" and the "Torso of Hera" (Early Archaic period, c. 660–580 BC. Both are in the Louvre, Paris). After about 575 BC, figures such as these, both male and female, began wearing the so-called 'archaic smile'. This may have been a device to give the figures a distinctive human appearance.
Three types of figures are common – the standing nude youth ("kouros", plural "kouroi"), the standing draped girl ("kore", plural "korai"), and the seated woman. All emphasize and generalize the essential features of the human figure and show an increasingly accurate understanding of human anatomy. 
The (75 cm high) limestone Cretan sculpture called the Lady of Auxerre, at the Louvre is a Greek goddess of c. 650–625 BC. It is a "Kore" ("maiden") whose her right hand touches her solar plexus and her left is stiffly at her side (Basel 2001). 
Maxime Collignon, a Louvre curator, found the sculpture in a storage vault in the Museum of Auxerre, a city east of Paris, in 1907. No-one knows how it got there, according to the Louvre monograph. 
This archaic sculpture has traces of coloured paint. It dates from the 7th century BC, when Greece was emerging from its Dark Age. The Lady of Auxerre still has the narrow waist of a Minoan–Mycenaean goddess, and her stiff hair suggests Egyptian influence.
The Classical period saw better Greek sculpture. There was a big improvement in producing realistic human forms. Poses became more naturalistic, notably during the beginning of the period (see the Charioteer of Delphi for an example of the transition to more naturalistic sculpture). 
From about 500 BC, Greek statues began increasingly to depict real people. The statues of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, set up in Athens mark the overthrow of the aristocratic tyranny, are said to be the first public monuments to show actual individuals.
Also, we begin to see references to the sculptors themselves in writings of the period. Examples include Phidias, known to have overseen the design and building of the Parthenon, and Praxiteles, whose nude female nude sculptures were the first to be considered artistically respectable. 
The Classical period also saw an increase in the use of statues and sculptures as decorations of buildings. The temples of the Classical era included the Parthenon in Athens, and the Temple of Zeus at Olympia. They had relief sculpture for decorative friezes, and sculpture in the round to fill the triangular fields of the pediments. Most of these works survive only in fragments, for example the Parthenon Marbles, roughly half of which are in the British Museum.
The Hellenistic period is from 323 BC to 146 BC. A number of the best-known works of Greek sculpture belong to this period, including Laocoön and his Sons, Venus de Milo, and the Winged Victory of Samothrace.
All these statues show classical themes, but their treatment is far more sensuous and emotional than the Classical period would have allowed. Hellenistic sculpture was also marked by an increase in size, which culminated in the Colossus of Rhodes (late 3rd century), thought to have been roughly the same size as the Statue of Liberty. The combined effect of earthquakes and looting have destroyed this.
Almost all forms of Greek and Roman art were coloured in the original. Most Greek sculptures were painted in strong and bright colours. The clothing and hair were painted, with the skin left in the natural colour of the stone. Some sculptures were entirely painted. The polychromy of stone statues was paralleled by the use of different materials to distinguish skin, clothing and other details, and by the use of different metals for lips, fingernails, etc. on high-quality bronzes like the Riace bronzes.

Speedometer

A speedometer is a type of gauge that shows the speed a vehicle is moving. It usually shows the speed in miles per hour (mph) for countries that use the statute mile for distances or Kilometres per hour (kph) for countries that use the metric system. Originally, a speedometer was an option that car owners could buy to put on their car. Begining about 1910 it was built into all cars.
The electric speedometer was invented by the Croatian Josip Belušić in 1888, and was originally called a velocimeter. Charles Babbage is credited with creating an early type of a speedometer. These were usually fitted to locomotives.
A spedometer was patented by a German, Otto Schulze on October 7, 1902, it uses a rotating flexible cable usually driven by gearing linked to the output of the vehicle's transmission. The early Volkswagen Beetle and many motorcycles, however, use a cable driven from a front wheel.
Most speedometers have tolerances of some ±10%, mainly due to variations in tire diameter. Sources of error due to tire diameter variations are wear, temperature, pressure, vehicle load, and nominal tire size. Vehicle manufacturers usually calibrate speedometers to show the vehicle is going faster.
When a tire has less air pressure than it should, it is underinflated. Underinflation causes excessive heat and reduces the diameter of the tires. This causes it to rotate faster than the speedometer shows it is. Tires underinflated by only 10 psi can mean a car or truck reading 70 mph on the speedometer is actually traveling at 72 mph.

Diving bell

A diving bell was an early system for underwater diving. The basic idea of a bell is that a hollow object, even with an open bottom, will hold air when put under water (this can be seen with a glass in a sink). If the bell is heavy enough it will sink below the water. A swimmer can be inside the bell and breath, or hold his breath and swim outside the bell for a short time, and come back to the bell to breath again. The idea had been around for a long time, but became useful in the 1600s. Scuba diving has mostly replaced diving bells although they are still used sometimes.

<doc id="393962" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=393962" title="Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa Aboriginal Land Trust">
Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa Aboriginal Land Trust

Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa Aboriginal Land Trust is the land trust that holds the freehold title to the land of Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park (referred to as Northern Territory Portion 1728). The trust is the legal landowner and holds the title on behalf of the people who are recognised as the land's traditional owners. It was created on 26 October 1985.
The land was originally claimed as part of the Katiti Land Claim in 1979. It was sumbitted by the Central Land Council on the behalf of several hundred people, most of whom lived at Muṯitjulu. The claim was judged in 1980, and Commissioner Justice John Toohey formally recognised 104 traditional owners for Uluṟu and 57 for Kata Tjuṯa. He granted them freehold title to the land now held by the Katiti Aboriginal Land Trust. They were not granted the title to Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa because it was already being used as a national park.
There was then a long legal case over the freehold title (actual ownership) of the park lands. The case continued until November 1983, when Prime Minister Bob Hawke acknowledged that the traditional owners had the rights to Uluṟu. In 1985, the Territory passed two amendments: one for the Aboriginal Land Rights Act and one for the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. The freehold title to the land in the park was passed to the Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa Aboriginal Land Trust on 26 October 1985. As part of the agreement, the land was immediately leased back to the Director of National Parks for a period of 99 years. The title is inalienable, which means that it can not be sold, traded or given away; it is inherited continuously by the community's descendants.

Palisades Sill

The Palisades Sill is a Triassic intrusion, formed 200 million years ago. It runs through parts of New York and New Jersey. It is noteworthy for The Palisades, cliffs which rise steeply above the western bank of the Hudson River. The visibility of the sill,and its unique features, have got much attention from nature enthusiasts, rock climbers, and geologists.
The outcrop of the Palisades Sill is quite recognizable for its prominent cliffs above the Hudson River; it is easily seen from the western portions of Manhattan. The exposure is approximately long, most of it following the Hudson River. It first emerges in Staten Island in New York City. The sill then crosses the state line into New Jersey, where Hoboken, Jersey City, Union City, Fort Lee, and Englewood Cliffs all lie on it.
The end of the Triassic saw large-scale rifting during the break-up of Pangaea. What is now eastern North America began to separate from what is now north-western Africa, creating the young Atlantic Ocean. Magma came from decompression melting, and some was pushed into the pre-existing sandstones and arkoses. The magma solidified and, after millions of years, the overlying rocks got uplifted and eroded, exposing the Palisades Sill as we see it.
There is an average stratigraphic thickness of 300 meters (~1000 feet), with the famous cliffs rising 100 meters (300 ft) on average above sea level. The intrusion dips between 10 and 15 degrees westward for most of its length. The sill was intruded at a depth of about 3-5 kilometers. These studies also concluded that the sill was in a position nearly identical to its current one (10-to-15-degree dip); this is further confirmed by the still-vertical orientation of the columnar jointing.
The Watchung basalt flows of the Watchung Mountains are eruptions onto the surface of the same magma that created the Palisades Sill.

The Mannanana Range () is a mountain range in the southwest of the Northern Territory, Australia. It is a section of the Petermann Ranges. It roughly consists of a single ridge about long. It extends northwest towards Kaltukatjara from Tjunti, where it is split from the Curdie Range by the Hull River. The Hull winds around the range from the south and then runs along its northeastern side.
The name "Mannanana" was first recorded on maps by Herbert Basedow. It comes from "", which is actually the Pitjantjatjara name for the range immediately to the west. This western range takes its name from (meaning "woman's buttocks"), which is a formation overlooking Kaltukatjara and the Docker River on the range's western end. The name for the Mannanana Range in Pitjantjatjara is , after the Tjunti soakage at its eastern end.

Quantum teleportation

Quantum teleportation is a way of transferring the quantum state of one quantum system to another using the quantum entanglement between two other systems.
For example, let's assume Alice and Bob share an entangled pair of particles A and B, and Alice wants to teleport the information of another "message" particle M to Bob. 
What Alice does is interact her half of the entangled pair, A, she shares with Bob, so that now the message particle M is entangled with Alice's other particle A.
Next Alice measures both of her particles A and M and tells what the outcomes of these measurements are to Bob. Because the message particle M was entangled with Alice's other particle A, and Bob has the information of Alice's measurements, he can use this information to recreate the original message particle M out of the one he has B. 
What makes quantum teleportation special is that we didn't need to physically move the message particle M from Alice to Bob.

Paracel Islands is the name for a number of uninhabited atolls and reefs in the South China Sea. They are about from Hainan and about from Vietnam. Currently they are under the control of the People's Republic of China, but Taiwan and Vietnam also claim them. The islands are uninhabited. 
The islands are located in the South China Sea consisting of over 30 islets, sandbanks and reefs with about of the ocean surface. The archipelago is approximately equidistant from the coastlines of Vietnam and China, southeast of Hainan Island, and about one-third of the way from central Vietnam to the northern Philippines. Turtles live on the islands, and seabirds have left nests and guano deposits, but there are no permanent human residents except military personnel and fishermen. 
The islands are divided into two main groups. The Amphitrite group is in the northeast and the Crescent group is in the southwest, and they are located about from one another. Subject to hot and humid climate, with abundant rainfall and frequent typhoons, the archipelago is surrounded by productive fishing grounds and potential oil and gas reserves.

Beach Erosion Board

The Beach Erosion Board (BEB) was a federal board organized under the US Government's War Department (later, the Department of Defense), U.S. Army, and was a part of the civil works program of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The Board had seven members and a staff. The life of the BEB spanned a period of 33 years, beginning with its establishment in July 1930. The BEB was abolished in November of 1963.
The functions of the BEB pertained to review of reports of investigations made concerning erosion of the shores of coastal and lake waters, and the protection of those shores. Under its implementing legislation, Section 2 of Public Law 520, 7lst Congress, approved on July 3, 1930, the Chief of Engineers, U.S. Army, was given authority to make, in cooperation with the appropriate agencies of the various coastal States, investigations and studies aimed at devising effective means of presenting erosion of the shores of coastal and lake waters by waves and currents. The funding provision for these investigations and studies was that no money should be expended under authority of the Act in any State which did not provide for cooperation with the agecies of the United States and contribute to the project such funds and/or services as the Secretary of War deemed appropriate and required.
In 1963, certain of the BEB’s functions were transferred to the newly created Coastal Engineering Research Center, while others were transferred to the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors. Pursuant to the federal Water Resources Development Act of 1992, the duties and responsibilities of the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors subsequently were transferred by the Secretary of the Army to other elements within the Department of the Army as the Secretary determined to be necessary.

Sub-Roman Britain

Sub-Roman Britain is the name given to Britain from the withdrawal of the Roman legions in 410 AD to the beginning of the seventh century.
After four centuries of rule, Roman legions withdrew from Roman Britain at the beginning of the fifth century. However Roman culture and probably a vernacular Latin language survived for another two centuries with a gradual invasion the Anglo-Saxons from northern Germany and the Jutland peninsula.
The invasion was initially halted by the Romano-British. The Anglo-Saxons obtained control of eastern England at the end of the 5th century. In the mid-6th century they started expanding again into the English Midlands. Then in the 7th century they expanded again into the south-west and the north of England. The unconquered parts of southern Britain, notably Wales and surrounding areas of western Britain, retained their Romano-British culture, in particular Christianity.
Some Anglo-Saxon histories (in context) refer to the Romano-British people by the term "Welsh", which is an Old English word meaning 'foreigner', referring to the old inhabitants of southern Britain. Historically, Wales and the south-western peninsula were known respectively as North Wales and West Wales.
Recent discoveries have helped document the continuing urban occupation of some Romano-British towns near Watling Street such as "Viriconium" (Wroxeter) and "Venta" (Caerwent), in those two centuries.
One of the last Sub-Roman cities to be conquered by the Anglo-Saxons was "Deva Victrix" (Chester), where Roman "amphoras" were used until 616 AD. The Romano-British may have survived partly because of the Chester city walls; the city had been defended by walls since the foundation of the Deva Victrix fort on the site in 79 AD.

Rufous hare-wallaby

The rufous hare-wallaby ("Lagorchestes hirsutus") is a small wallaby found in Australia. It is also known by its Western Desert name mala. It used to be found widely across the western half of Australia, but is now only found in Bernier and Dorre Islands in Shark Bay. It is currently classified as a vulnerable species.
The rufous hare-wallaby is a nocturnal herbivore that eats herbs, leaves and seeds. It is usually solitary, meaning that it lives alone. The species was first described by John Gould in "The Mammals of Australia" (1844). It is currently being reintroduced to mainland Australia, to the Tanami Desert in the Northern Territory. Four distinct groups of this species have been described as subspecies:
The mala is a common totem in Western Desert Aboriginal Dreamings.

Hasty generalization

Hasty generalization is an informal fallacy of generalisation by making decisions based on too little evidence or without recognizing all of the variables. In statistics, it may mean basing broad conclusions of a survey from a small sample group.
A hasty generalization made from a single example is sometimes called the "fallacy of the lonely fact" or the "proof by example fallacy".
When evidence is intentionally excluded to bias the result, it is sometimes termed the "fallacy of exclusion".

Kelly Hills

The Kelly Hills () are a mountain range at the southern end of the Northern Territory of Australia. It is located directly north of the Musgrave Ranges, and about northeast of Amaṯa. Its highest point is about above sea level. Mount Robert, at the eastern end of the range, is about 796 metres above sea level. The area is known as Aputjilpinya in the native Yankunytjatjara language. It forms part of an important Mala Dreaming track that runs between Uluṟu and Ulkiya.
There are a few soakages located within the hills. One of them, Puntitjara, was recorded by several early White explorers travelling through the Kelly Hills. The South Australian government's North-West Prospecting Expedition, led by Lawrence Wells, was brought there by an Aboriginal guide in 1903. One of the expedition's prospectors, Herbert Basedow, recorded the name as "Punndijarrinna" and reported that it was a good source of water. Basedow returned to Puntitjara in June 1926 on another expedition, this one led by Donald Mackay. According to Mackay, they found it dry and covered with a layer of sand. The anthropologist Ted Strehlow visited Puntitjara in August 1936, but founded it covered by mud.

Jenny Lind (Johanna Maria Lind, Stockholm, 6 October 1820 – Wynd's Point, Herefordshire, 2 November 1887) was a Swedish opera singer. She was nicknamed the "Swedish Nightingale". She was in great demand in opera roles throughout Sweden and northern Europe during the 1840s, and became the protégée of Felix Mendelssohn. After two acclaimed seasons in London, she announced her retirement from opera at the age of 29.
In 1850, Lind went to America at the invitation of the showman P. T. Barnum. She gave 93 concerts for him and then continued to tour under her own management. She donated her proceeds to charities, mainly the endowment of free schools in Sweden. With her husband, Otto Goldschmidt, she returned to Europe in 1852. They had three children. She gave occasional concerts over the next two decades, settling in England in 1855. From 1882, for some years, she was a professor of singing at the Royal College of Music in London. She was the inspiration for Hans Christian Andersen's "The Nightingale". Lind died on 2 November 1887 in Herefordshire, England, of cancer. She is buried in the Great Malvern Cemetery.

Compound (linguistics)

Compound words are words that add together to make a new word, like the word "side" and "walk", to make "sidewalk". These words often develop over time. They can start as two words joined with a hyphen, and then become a compound word. There are three types of compound words; closed, hyphenated and open. A closed compound word is joined into one word like "keyboard" or "makeup". A hyphenated word is two words joined with a hyphen like "mother-in-law". Open compound words are words which are used together like "police station", or "fire engine".
This is a short list with some common compound words.

The game takes place in an amusement park, which acts as the game's hub (setting). The park's attractions are twelve minigames based on Nintendo's most popular video game series. Attractions include minigames based on "The Legend of Zelda", "Metroid", "Mario", and "Donkey Kong". There are three kinds of attractions: team attractions, solo attractions, and competitive attractions. In team attractions, players work as teams. In solo attractions, only one player can play the attraction. In competitive attractions, players play against each other. Except in solo attractions, up to five players can play at a time. Completing attractions and meeting certain objectives earn the player coins. Coins can be used in a single-player pachinko minigame. Completing pachinko stages will give the player new items to decorate the game's hub area.

Ambrosius Aurelianus

Ambrosius Aurelianus was a powerful Romano-British leader in Sub-Roman Britain around mid-5th century. He has been identified with the legendary King Arthur by historians like John Morris.
Ambrosius Aurelianus was born in Roman Britain in the years when Roman legions withdrew from the British isles and started the Anglo-Saxon conquest. He seems to be born in a noble Roman family, resident in Britain for many generations. He also appeared independently in the legends of the Britons, beginning with the 9th-century "Historia Brittonum", written by Nennius.
His importance comes from the fact that he is the "only Romano-british leader" named by Gildas, who was the only historian who lived during Sub-Roman Britain times: this fact makes Ambrosius Aurelianus an historical and "real" personality in the King Arthur legends.
He was renowned for his campaigns against the Anglo-Saxons, and there is some speculation that he (or his son, according to the historian Gildas) may have commanded the Romano-British forces at the Battle of Badon Hill, where the barbarians were won around 500 AD. After this battle for fifty years the Anglo-Saxons were stopped fron conquering all Britain.
Ambrosius Aurelianus is one of the few people that Gildas (a sixth century historian who lived in South-west Britain and wrote "De Excidio Britanniae", which focused largely on the history of Christian Britain) identifies by name in his sermon "De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae", and the only one named from the 5th century. Following the destructive assault of the Saxons, the survivors gather together under the leadership of Ambrosius, who is described as:
We know from Gildas that he was of high birth, and had Roman ancestry; he was presumably a Romano-Briton, rather than a Roman from elsewhere in the empire, though it is impossible to be sure. It also appears that Ambrosius was a Christian: Gildas says that he won his battles "with God's help". According to Gildas, Ambrosius organised the survivors into an armed force and achieved the first military victory over the Saxon invaders. However, this victory was not decisive: "Sometimes the Saxons and sometimes the citizens (meaning the Romano-British inhabitants) were victorious."

Fools Garden is a German musical group. It was formed in 1991 under the name Fool's Garden. They started in 1991 with the album "Fool's Garden". The offical first album which included the complete band was "Once in a Blue Moon" (1993). Two years later, Fool's Garden released their third album "Dish of the Day", which scored a hit on the music charts in Europe and Asia with "Lemon Tree". The re-released track peaked at #26 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1996.
"Go And Ask Peggy For The Principal Thing" followed in 1997, along with three more albums in 2000, 2003 and 2005. In 2003, three members left the band, and were replaced by Dirk Blümlein (bassist), Claus Müller (drummer) and Gabriel Holz (second guitarist, who then left the band in 2007). The name of the band was changed to Fools Garden (without the apostrophe).
The band has released cover-versions of rock and roll songs during live performances (The Beatles' "Ticket to Ride" or The Who's "My Generation"). Fools Garden's interest in The Beatles's led them to put cover versions of songs "Cry Baby Cry" and "Martha My Dear" on their studio albums.
The band released a greatest hits compilation album in October 2009. The album, "High Times", contained fifteen songs. They included a brand new song, "High Time", and some of the well-known hits re-recorded with the new band ("Lemon Tree", "Wild Days", "Suzy").
The latest album "Who Is Jo King?" was released in October 2012.

The Texas City Disaster of 1947 was a major and very deadly incident. It happened on Wednesday, April 16, 1947, and was one of the largest non-nuclear explosions to hit the United States. The incident began as a late morning fire on the French vessel SS "Grandcamp" which had been docked next to Texas City and nearby Galveston. But then, its almost twenty three hundred ton cargo of ammonium nitrate detonated, creating several massive explosions that caused serious damage. The incident killed 581 people.

Dead reckoning

Dead Reckoning (or DR) is a method of estimating a position. It is an important part of navigation. It uses the last known point (a fix), and speed and direction the vehicle or person has moved since it was at the fix, to make a good guess where the current position is. 
It is used to track where a ship or airplane or sometimes where a vehicle on land is at. Now, Global Positioning System (GPS) is used and dead reckoning is not as important. But it is still used in areas where GPS is not available or for short periods of time if a GPS update is missed. It is also good to know in case the GPS satellites are damaged by a solar flare, or equipment is lost or broken, so it is still taught to sailors and pilots.
Dead Reckoning is how the sailors mapped the world after Christopher Columbus discovered the New World. Using the stars, they could find their latitude (distance between the equator and the poles). But before accurate clocks were created, they could not tell their longitude (how far east or west they were) unless they saw land that they knew. So to cross the oceans they used dead reckoning. This is also how Richard Byrd became the first person to fly to the North Pole in 1926. He was able to fly for 16 hours and come back to the place he had left, with only ice fields beneath him.
Dead reckoning starts from a known point (the fix). Then the speed of the vehicle needs to be known. In old times, ships would throw a log over the side (tied to a rope) and count how long it took to pass this log (or to pull a rope with knots and count how many knots get pulled out in a certain amount of time). This would give the speed of the ship. Knowing the direction from a compass would give the direction. From these two numbers an estimate (a good guess) could be made about the current location of the vehicle. However, a wind pushes the vehicle to one side (called "drift") so this needs to be measured as well. Also there are currents in the water, even in the middle of the ocean. Over time this could make errors as well, so charts were made to correct for currents. 
Airplanes can measure their windspeed easily (how fast they are going through the air), but not how fast they are moving over the land (called "ground speed"). A head wind, tail wind, or cross wind changes the ground speed. If the altitude of the plane is known, then the ground speed can be found by timing how fast the plane goes past an object on the ground. (The higher you are, the slower the ground seems to move). A window on the floor of the airplane can be used to find the ground speed and the drift of the airplane. 
A vehicle on ground can also use dead reckoning. Usually they do not need to worry about drift from the wind, and there are no currents on land, so this reckoning is easier.

Iltur, South Australia

Iltur is the name of a remote Pitjantjatjara homeland in the Great Victoria Desert of South Australia. It is also known as Ilturnga or Coffin Hill after the rocky outcrop where it is located. It is located at the southern end of the Birksgate Range, and is one of the most southerly locations on the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands. It was visited by the Elder Scientific Exploring Expedition in 1981, led by the explorer David Lindsay.
Many of the families who had lived in this region historically were forced to leave the area due to nuclear weapons tests at Maralinga. They were moved to Fregon in the north and to Yalata, very far to the south. Not all of them left, however, and some still living around Iltur reported that they were affected by the fallout of the tests. In 1976, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs offered AU$10,000 for the establishment of an outstation community at Iltur. An outstation was built, but is not always occupied.

Honeypot ant

Honeypot ants, or repletes, are sterile worker ants which are used as food stores. They develop swelled abdomens, filled with food by other worker ants. They are living storage containers. There are five genera of honepot ants. 
Ant species often have polymorphs: different forms of the same type. The soldier ants which defend colonies are genetically the same as the normal workers. The way they develop is different. This is done by changes in food, or by pheromones. 
Young honeypot ants are more or less force-fed until their gasters (=stomachs) are swelled up. Then they act as living food storage vessels. These food storage workers are called "repletes". 
These replete workers develop in the North American honeypot ant "Myrmecocystus mexicanus". Rissing found that usually the largest workers in the colony develop into repletes; and, if repletes are removed from the colony, other workers become repletes. This shows the flexibility of this polymorphism.
Honey ants use their own bodies as living storage, but they have more function than just storing food. Some store liquids, body fat, and water brought to them by worker ants. They can later serve as a food source for their fellow ants when food is otherwise scarce. When the liquid stored inside a honeypot ant is needed, the worker ants stroke the antennae of the honeypot ant, causing the honeypot ant to regurgitate the stored liquid.
In certain places, such as the Australian outback, honeypot ants are eaten by people as sweets and are considered a delicacy.

Makiri is a place in the northwest of South Australia, where a rock hole and an Aboriginal outstation are located. It is in the Great Victoria Desert, between Kaltjiti and Watarru. It is an important sacred site for the "" (honey ant) Dreaming, a women's law. Much of the site was desecrated by a surveying team in 1969. It was officially declared a Prohibited Area by the South Australian government in 1973, as an "important Aboriginal mythological and cultural site".
Makiri is located in a region of shrubland and sand dunes. The outstation here was established in the early 1980s. Since 1984, it has been governed and supported by the Irintata Homelands group from Kaltjiti. There is one house with solar power. Water is supplied from a rainwater tank and a bore. It is often used as a research base by scientists, as the area supports several endangered species.

Spiders of the Hogna are large and powerful wolf spiders. They belong to the Family called "Lycosidae." They will readily catch and eat crickets and other large insects. They do not try to hurt humans unless they are getting hurt themselves. Usually their colors are dull, mostly they are brown, dark brown, or black. 
"Hogna carolinensis" is the largest spider in the United States and can have a body length (head to tail) of up to almost 1.5 inches or 35mm. They scare people, but it is hard to get them even to try to bite. Instead of showing their , they will run away. They can run very fast. They are about 16 times larger than the smallest species of wolf spiders. For instance, the largest of the wolf spiders of the genus "Trabeops" are only 4 mm. long. 
"Hogna carolinensis" often digs burrows to live in. 
Other species in this genus include:
In Europe there is a slightly smaller spider called "Lycosa tarantula," a kind of wolf spider that people once believed could kill people. It gets its name from the city of Taranto in Italy. There are other wolf spiders that get a little larger than "Hogna carolinensis", one of which is found in the Canary Islands, "Allohogna singoriensis," which reaches a full 40mm.

Great Expectations

Great Expectations is a novel by Charles Dickens. It depicts the growth and personal development of an orphan named Philip Pirrip ("Pip"). The novel was first published in serial form in Dickens' weekly periodical "All the Year Round", from 1 December 1860 to August 1861. In October 1861, Chapman and Hall published the novel in three volumes.
It is set among the marshes of Kent and in London in the early to mid 19th century. From the outset, the reader is "treated" by the terrifying encounter between Pip, the protagonist, and the escaped convict, Abel Magwitch. "Great Expectations" is a graphic book, full of extreme imagery, poverty, prison ships, "the hulks," barriers and chains, and fights to the death. It therefore combines intrigue and unexpected twists of autobiographical detail in different tones. Regardless of its narrative technique, the novel reflects the events of the time, Dickens' concerns, and the relationship between society and man.
Dickens felt "Great Expectations" was his best work, calling it "a very fine idea," and was very sensitive to compliments from his friends: "Bulwer, who has been, as I think you know, extraordinarily taken by the book." The cast includes the capricious Miss Havisham, the cold and beautiful Estella, the kind and generous blacksmith Joe, the dry and sycophantic Uncle Pumblechook, and the eloquent and wise Herbert Pocket. Throughout the narrative, typical Dickensian themes emerge: wealth and poverty, love and rejection, and the eventual triumph of good over evil. 
"Great Expectations" has been translated into many languages and adapted many times to movies and other media.

They dig a shallow hole and line it with silk. When they lay eggs they put them in silk sacs that they make. Then they carry them along with them by attaching the egg sac to their spinnerets. They may lay from 150 to 500 eggs at a time. All mother wolf spiders let their babies ride on top of their abdomens for several days after they hatch.

The name comes from the words ' (emu) and ' (referring to a place from which the ancestral being is believed to originate; "" is a waterhole). It is a major sacred site for the (Emu Dreaming), and has been used for ceremonies by the Pitjantjatjara since long before colonisation of Australia.
Kaḻayapiṯi forms the southern heartland of the traditional Pitjantjatjara territory. According to the anthropologist Norman Tindale, the Pitjantjatjara people originally migrated from the southern coast. Kaḻayapiṯi served as their main home as they moved further north and northeast into the Tomkinson, Mann and Petermann Ranges. The rock hole here was very important during droughts, as there were few sources of water so reliable and permanent in the Great Victoria Desert to the south. However, during a long and severe drought between 1914 and 1916, the Pitjantjatjara were forced to move further east into the Musgrave Ranges, traditionally Yankunytjatjara territory.

Her paintings are held in the Art Gallery of Western Australia, National Gallery of Victoria, and the National Gallery of Australia.
Woods was born about 1935. She was born close to Kaḻayapiṯi, a rock hole in the Great Victoria Desert of South Australia. She grew up living a traditional, nomadic way of life in the bush with her family, before any contact with Euro-Australian society. They often camped at Kaḻayapiṯi, where Woods and the other girls would gather bushfood together. She learned to carve basic tools and decorative objects, and to burn traditional patterns into the wood (this is called ""). She also learned to spin hair string on a hand-spun spindle and weave head rings and ceremonial belts from hair and feathers.
Woods began painting in 2000, after moving to Irrunytju. The women there opened an art centre as an community-owned economic project, called Irrunytju Arts. From the beginning of her career, Brown often painted with her friend Anmanari Brown. When Brown's husband died in 2007, the two women left Irrunytju and went to live at Papulankutja, on Ngaanyatjarra lands. Here, they paint for Papulankutja Artists. In April 2010, the two women held their first solo exhibition together at the Vivien Anderson Gallery in Melbourne. Woods has had two of her paintings chosen as finalists for the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award, in 2006 and 2008.
Woods' paintings are mostly about the (Two Sisters Dreaming), which is her personal Dreaming. They are structured like maps drawn in the sand, tracing the journey of the two sisters around the edge of the canvas. She paints in earthy colours, and uses solid and dotted lines in concentric circles to depict the journeys and activities of figures in the story.

AirTran was a low-cost American airline formerly known as ValuJet. It's hub was in Atlanta, Georgia and it operated routes throughout the Americas.
ValuJet's first flight was in 1993. In 1996, ValuJet Flight 592, a DC-9 aircraft, crashed into the Everglades shortly after takeoff from Miami International Airport, after a fire on board. 110 people died in the crash. The NTSB blamed Valujet's maintenance contractor, SabreTech for improper maintenance.
After the large amount of negative publicity surrounding this tragedy, ValuJet suffered serious financial problems and nearly went bankrupt. It merged with a smaller airline called AirTran and assumed its name in 1997.
After management turnover and some replacement of older airplanes, AirTran appears to have turned around financially and has become profitable, even in the very difficult business environment encountered by all U.S. airlines since the September 11 Attacks.
In 2011, AirTran merged with Southwest Airlines. The merger was completed in 2014 and the "AirTran" name was no longer used.

They followed it up with the release of the second promotional single, "Young Volcanoes" released on April 8, 2013, also accompanied with a music video, which premiered on April 18 on YouTube.
In 2009, following two nationwide tours and the release of a greatest hits compilation, the members of Fall Out Boy decided to take a break. The band's decision stemmed from disillusionment with the music industry and the constant promotion of fourth record "Folie à Deux". The band's, specifically bassist/lyricist Pete Wentz, every movement had become fodder for gossip in tabloids, and lead vocalist/guitarist Patrick Stump recalled that "We found ourselves running on fumes a little bit -- creatively and probably as people, too." 
On February 4, 2013, the band called off the hiatus announcing a new single, new album, and a new tour.
Fall Out Boy did a concert tour in support of the album. It consisted of 16 shows in September 2013. The opening acts were Big Sean, who assists on the track "The Mighty Fall" on the album, and Panic! at the Disco.

The Tinderbox

"The Tinderbox" is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. It was originally published in Copenhagen, Denmark in May 1835 in the first booklet of "Fairy Tales Told for Children". The three other stories in the booklet were "Big Claus and Little Claus", "The Princess and the Pea", and "Little Ida's Flowers". The critics did not like these stories. They thought the stories immoral. "The Tinderbox" is Andersen's retelling of "The Spirit in the Candle", a traditional Danish story he knew as a child. It is also similar to "Aladdin and the Magic Lamp", another Andersen childhood favorite. The tale has been adapted to various media including the first Danish animated movie.
A soldier steals a magic tinderbox from an old witch. The tinderbox can summon three magic dogs that will do what the soldier wants them to do. He orders one dog to bring him a sleeping princess from her parents' castle. When the king and queen learn where their daughter is, the soldier is arrested and sentenced to death. At the last moment, he summons the dogs. They save his life and he marries the princess.

The Princess and the Pea

"The Princess and the Pea" is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. It was first published in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1835. It appeared as the third tale in the first book of Andersen's "Fairy Tales Told for Children". The other tales in the little book were "The Tinderbox", "Big Claus and Little Claus", and "Little Ida's Flowers". 
The story tells of a maiden whose royalty is established by her sensitivity to a pea placed under her matresses. Stories of super-sensitivity are rare. They are not unknown however in world literature and lore. Andersen heard the tale of the pea as a child, but it is unknown in Danish folk tradition. He probably heard a Swedish version of the tale.
The critics did not like these four stories. They did not like their informal, chatty style. They thought the stories immoral. The stories did not promote good behaviour and the mores of the times. "Little Claus and Big Claus", for instance, featured unpunished lying, hoodwinking, theft, and adulterous conduct. 
The story has been adapted to various media including a television program on Shelley Duval's "Fairy Tale Theatre". A popular musical play of the 1960s was based on the story called "Once Upon a Mattress". It starred comedienne Carol Burnett.
A prince decides to marry. He wants a real princess as his bride. He searches the world, but does not find one. He returns home disappointed. 
One stormy night, a rain-soaked maiden comes to the castle door. She is seeking shelter. She says she is a real princess. 
The Queen uses a test to determine if the maiden is really a princess. She puts a pea upon a bed. She then puts 20 mattresses and 20 feather beds upon the bed. Here the princess must pass the night.
In the morning, the maiden says that she could not sleep. She says there was something hard in the bed that kept her tossing and turning all night. Everyone now realizes she is a real princess! Only a real princess is so sensitive that she can feel a pea beneath a huge pile of bedding!

Father Divine (c. 1876September 10, 1965), also known as Reverend M. J. Divine, was an African American spiritual leader from about 1907 until his death. His full self-given name was Reverend Major Jealous Divine, and he was also known as "the Messenger" early in his life. He founded the International Peace Mission movement, formulated its doctrine, and oversaw its growth from a small and predominantly black congregation into a multiracial and international church.
Father Divine claimed to be God. Some people who lived at the same time claimed he was a charlatan; others say he was one of the first modern cult leaders. Father Divine made numerous contributions toward his followers' economic independence and racial equality. Father Divine was a contemporary of other religious leaders at that time such as Daddy Grace, Charles Harrison Mason, Noble Drew Ali and James F. Jones, also known as Prophet Jones. Another minister by the name of Jones would play an important part in a brief struggle to gain control of the Peace Mission following Divine's death - Jim Jones, of the 'apostolic socialist' movement Peoples Temple.

Defiance (2008 movie)

Defiance is a 2008 American war-drama movie. The movie directed by Edward Zwick. The movie stars Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, Jamie Bell and Mia Wasikowska. 
Inspired by a true story, director Edward Zwick's epic World War II drama Defiance tells the tale of three Jewish Eastern European brothers (Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, and Jamie Bell) who narrowly escape certain death at the hands of the Nazis, subsequently vowing to avenge the deaths of their loves ones by launching a desperate battle against the forces that seek to exterminate their entire race. The year is 1941, and the setting is Nazi-occupied Belarus. The Final Solution is in full effect, and the Jews of Eastern Europe are being slaughtered wholesale. Tuvia, Zus and Asael have miraculously managed to escape into the dense surrounding forest. Having played in these woods since childhood, the brothers have a distinct advantage over their adversaries, and soon decide that simply surviving is not enough. In order to make a difference, they must take action, but in order to take action they will need support. As whispers of their bravery take wind, others like them appear determined to lay their lives on the line for the cause of freedom. Tuvia has become the de facto leader of the group, but he's still somewhat reluctant to take on such a heavy responsibility and his brother Zus expresses concern that his idealistic plan will ultimately bring about the group's downfall. With winter setting in, everyone works to create a functioning community that will help them endure the frigid months that lie ahead, and Asael reluctantly finds himself caught in the crossfire of his older siblings' rivalry. Is it possible to keep faith alive in a time when the world seems devoid of humanity and survival becomes a way of life?

<doc id="394633" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=394633" title="Italian irredentism in Dalmatia">
Italian irredentism in Dalmatia

Italian irredentism in Dalmatia is related to the tentative of accession to Italy of coastal Dalmatia, promoted by the Dalmatian Italians from the Napoleonic era to World War II.
With the rise of the Risorgimento, in all Italian areas that were excluded from the unification of Italy (and with Italian majority population) started to be widely diffused the Italian movement called "Irredentism".
In the case of Dalmatia, after Napoleon there was the development of Slav nationalism against Italian irredentism. But until 1848 there were still some convergence between these two ethnic groups, in order to create an independent Dalmatia inside the Hapsburg Empire.
Dalmatian Italians always felt connected to the Italian Risorgimento, and among them were widely followed the ideas, intentions and ideals that flourished in the Peninsula. At Zara, in 1822, the Imperial Government made an 'Inquisition of State' to twenty-five Dalmatian Italians "Carbonari", another twenty-five were "persecuted" and sixty declared "suspicious." One of the supporters of this initial irredentism was Niccolo Tommaseo, born in Sebenico. He was an Italian Dalmatian linguist, journalist and essayist who become internationally famous because editor of the first Dizionario della Lingua Italiana.
In 1848, many young Italians from Istria and Dalmatia formed a 'Legion', crossed the Adriatic and fought with Niccolo Tommaseo for the "Republic of Venice". And in the same year, six Dalmatian Italians also fought for the "Roman Republic". One of them was Federico Seismit-Doda from Ragusa, who became a member of the Italian Parliament and even Finance Minister of the Kingdom of Italy under Benedetto Cairoli (1878) and Francesco Crispi (1889–1890). In the battle of Curtatone, as a first lieutenant of the Battalion 'Bande Nere', fought against the Austrians the Dalmatian Giurovich Marino: he was killed by the Austrian soldiers in Livorno as a promoter of the ideals of Giuseppe Mazzini. Twenty were the Dalmatians in the Italian independence war of 1859-1860 enrolled in the Italian army, or in the red shirts of Giuseppe Garibaldi. Among others, Marco Cossovich, a former lieutenant of the "Guardia Nobile" for the protection of Venice, who fought in Calatafimi and Palermo: one of the few that Garibaldi recalled by name in his book "I Mille". In the third Italian war of Independence, George Caravan from Tenin (near Zara), commanded the 5th Regiment of Grenadiers; after promotion, he became adjutant general of the King of Italy Umberto I.
With the battle of Lissa, part of Third Italian War of Independence, in 1866 began a period of open hostility against the Dalmatian Italians by the Austrians, who favored the Croatian part because on their side.
The historian Matteo Bartoli in his book "The language of the Italian Venezia Giulia and Dalmatia", wrote that:
The most renowned Dalmatian Italian in those years was Antonio Bajamonti, the last Italian mayor of Spalato. He spent his entire life and his own activity for this city, but his economic expenses were never reimbursed by the Austrians despite repeated promises. He was a moderate irredentist who was the propeller of important public works in his city, including the introduction of lighting gas, building the aqueduct and the hospital, creating technical schools and doing the foundation of the Dalmatian Bank. For his initiative Split was also given a square surrounded by galleries. His most famous work was the construction of the big fountain that was named later after him. Three months later after the second opening of the fountain, Antonio Bajamonti died (the fountain was destroyed in 1947 by Yugoslav authorities who considered it as a symbol of fascism and Italian domination of the city). He created the Società Politica Dalmata in 1886 in order to defend the Italian characteristics of Spalato, but died at age 69 in 1891 with debt up to his neck.
Another famous Dalmatian irredentist was Arturo Colautti. He was a writer and journalist who -from his native Zara- relocated to Spalato in 1876, where he founded the magazine of culture and literature, "Rivista Dalmatica". The magazine did not last long, because strongly pro-Italian and related to Antonio Bajamonti. In the same year, he was asked to direct "L'Avvenire" and, from 1876 al 1880, he developed it as an irredentist newspaper. Following the publication of an anti-Austrian article on his newspaper, in September 1880, Colautti was attacked by a group of Croatian soldiers who rendered him impaired for a few months. Shortly after, also because of the threat of lawsuit for crimes against the stringent Austrian press laws and for his support of Italian irredentism, Colautti chose the path of exile and took refuge in the Kingdom of Italy (where he strongly supported the intervention of Italy in World War I).
In 1885 a group of young Dalmatian Italians created a sort of secret pact which pledged to fight on a united front against the government of Vienna. They chose to use all legal means available. They were: John Marino Bonda Avoscan (from Ragusa), Stefano Smerchinich (from Curzola) and Ercolano Salvi Pezzoli Leonardo (from Premuda), John Lubin (from Trau), Emanuele Fenzi and Louise Pini (from Sebenico), Christmas Krekich, Luigi and Roberto Ziliotto Ghiglianovich (from Zara), all representatives of the Italian irredentistm with the most sincere patriotism. The same (precisely Ghiglianovich, Krekich, Lubin, Pini, Salvi, Ziliotto, Smerchinich) in 1919, during the crisis in the city of Fiume (Rijeka), wrote the articles "Application of the Dalmatians" and "Cry of Sebenico" published on 2 October by the national newspaper "The national responsibility" (according to them one of the few Italian newspapers promoting the union of Dalmatia to Italy).
In the late nineteenth century were created in Dalmatia some Italian cultural associations, as the irredentist "Philological circle" in Ragusa and the "National Union Committee," the "Diadora" and "Iuventus Iadertina" in Zara. Also active in these years was the "National Association" in Spalato, based on the Bajamonti theater, which was set on fire (officially by unknown people) in 1893. In Spalato, the city of Emperor Diocletian, in the year 1910 there were 1,046 Italians officially counted, when in the same year more than 3,000 were enrolled in the cultural and patriotic public association "Dante Alighieri." In Zara a group, under the leadership of irredentists Desanti and Boxich (dissatisfied followers of the "Dalmatian Autonomist Party" of Luigi Ziliotto), founded the newspaper "Il Risorgimento" in 1908, promoting openly the unification to Italy of Dalmatia, but was closed in 1914.
About 3,500 Italians in Dalmatia during World War I took refuge as exiles in Italy. They were led by Antonio Cippico, Alessandro and Roberto Dudan Ghiglianovich: more than 250 volunteers enrolled in the Italian army and risked the gallows, as when the Austrians killed Francesco Rismondo (executed in Gorizia in 1915 and active member of the irredentist organization "Pro Patria" in Spalato). To Francesco Rismondo the Kingdom of Italy awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.
The number of volunteers from the remote ports of Montenegro (as Cattaro, Castelnuovo di Cattaro and Perasto) appears very high in proportion to the total number of enrolled in the Italian Army. In fact, these volunteers in Spalato, Cattaro, Ragusa, Perasto, Castelnuovo di Cattaro, Trau and Macarsca (not less than 90 in total, almost half of all volunteers in Dalmatia) fought in Italy despite the "Treaty of London", which categorically excluded the possible "Redemption" and annexation to Italy of their cities.
Dalmatian Italians obtained their "Redenzione" (meaning redemption or union to Italy) in the years following the Italian victory in World War I. In the peace treaty the territory of Zara and some Dalmatian islands (Cherso, Lussino and Lagosta) were united to the Kingdom of Italy. But the full agreements reached in 1915 in the Treaty of London were not respected by the Allies, because of the opposition from US president Woodrow Wilson. This created huge resentment, that was pinpointed in the phrase "Vittoria mutilata" (mutilated victory) created by the nationalist D'Annunzio.
As a direct consequence in 1920 Gabriele D'Annunzio made his famous Occupation of Fiume. The so-called "Poeta imaginífico" did a dramatic attack with paramilitaries and a group of "Legionaires" from the Italian city of Monfalcone and occupied the city of Fiume, which the Allied powers had assigned to Italy as winner of the war. With this gesture D'Annunzio reached the pinnacle of the process of building their own personal and political myth. D'Annunzio personally entered in Fiume with a column of Dalmatian Italian volunteers (mostly irredentist).
On November 12, 1920 was signed the Treaty of Rapallo: Fiume became a free city (Free State of Fiume), while Zara was given to Italy. But D'Annunzio did not accept the agreement and the Italian Government, on 26 December 1920, evicted from Fiume the Legionaries by force. Fiume and the more northern islands of Dalmatia were incorporated in 1924 to the Kingdom of Italy, thanks to the large contribution of the Italian irredentists in town.
Even in Trau the irredentists attempted to repeat what D'Annunzio did in Fiume: the local Count Farfogna in September 1919 occupied Trau with some Italian troops, but the Us intervention blocked him. Other problems arose in Spalato in 1920, in the so-called Incidents of Spalato.
The irredentist aspiration of the Dalmatian Italians was fully met when Yugoslavia in April 1941 was conquered and occupied by Italy and Germany. At the end of that month almost all of the Dalmatian coast, with the major cities of Spalato, Sebenico and Cattaro were annexed to Italy with the name Governatorate of Dalmatia. The coastal area between Fiume and Segna was not incorporated in the Governatorate and went to the fascist Croatia of Ante Pavelić (although it was controlled militarily by the Italian army). Even the area around Ragusa was theoretically croatian, but the Italians ruled everything in the city, opening even Italian schools.
The Governatorate was divided between the three provinces of Zara, Spalato and Cattaro, and many families of Dalmatian italians who were forced to move to Italy after World War I were relocated in these provinces (mainly in order to administer it).
Though Italy had initially larger territorial aims that extended from the Velebit mountains to the Albanian Alps, Mussolini decided against annexing further territories due to a number of factors. One was that Dalmatian irredentists like Antonio Tacconi complained that a larger annexation would have included hundreds of thousands of Slavs, who were partially hostile to Italy within the enlarged national borders.
But this "Redemption" (as was called by the Dalmatian Italians) lasted only a few years: with the defeat of Italy in World War II the Italians of Istria and Dalmatia were expelled 'en masse' during the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus (while Zara was fully destroyed by Allies bombings promoted by Tito and later nicknamed the "Italian Dresden" by Enzo Bettiza).

Roman expeditions to Lake Chad and western Africa

Roman expeditions to Lake Chad and western Africa were a group of military and commercial expeditions by the Romans across the Sahara Desert, into the interior of Africa and its coast. They were made by the Roman Empire between the first and the fourth century AD. One of the main reasons of the explorations, according to academics like Jonathan Roth, was to procure gold and spices
The Romans organized expeditions to cross the Sahara desert with five different routes:
All these expeditions were supported by legionaries and had mainly a commercial purpose. Only the one done by emperor Nero seemed to be a preparative for the conquest of Ethiopia or Nubia: in 62 AD two legionaries explored the sources of the Nile river.
One of the main reasons of the explorations was to get gold using the camel to transport it.
The explorations near the African western and eastern coasts were supported by Roman ships and deeply related to the naval commerce (mainly toward the Indian Ocean).
The first Roman expedition was done by Lucius Cornelius Balbus, following Augustus' wish to expand his Empire. In 19 BC he conquered the Garamantes (who lived in the Fezzan of Libya) and sent an expedition under Septimus Flaccus south across the Tibesti mountains, reaching the River Niger.
Gaius Suetonius Paulinus did another expedition to what is now southern Maroc (former Spanish Sahara) and Mauretania in 41 AD. He reached the northern area of the Senegal river and probably the western Niger river's affluents.
In the year 41 AD Suetonius Paullinus, afterwards Consul, was the first of the Romans who led an army across the Atlas Mountains. At the end of a ten days' march he reached the summit,—which even in summer was covered with snow,—and from thence, after passing a desert of black sand and burnt rocks, he arrived at a river called Gerj...he then penetrated into the country of the Canarii and Perorsi, the former of whom inhabited a woody region abounding in elephants and serpents, and the latter were Ethiopians, not far distant from the Pharusii and the river Daras (modern river Senegal). From the first century after Christ there is evidence (coins, fibulas) of Roman commerce and contacts in Akjoujt and Tamkartkart near Tichit in actual Mauritania.
The third was done a few years before by Julius Maternus, a Roman explorer who reached the Lake Chad area and described the abundance of animals like hippopotamus and rhinoceros in that northern Nigerian region. His travel lasted four months.
In the eastern Sahara was done the Nero expedition to Ethiopia: it was an exploratory expedition promoted by the Roman emperor Nero to discover the sources of the Nile River. Seneca wrote that around 62 AD Nero sent some legionaries to the city of Meroe in Nubia in order to explore all the Nile southward from that capital. Another expedition was recorded by Plinius the Elder in 68 AD. This expedition was the first in history from Europe to the interior of equatorial Africa. It probably lasted several months and bypassed the Sudanese swamps called Sudd during the dry season, reaching the northern portion of present-day Uganda.
The western coast of Africa was explored by the Romans after the conquest of northern Morocco (then called "Mauretania Tingitana"): the Roman vassal king Juba II organized a successful trade from the area of Volubilis. Pliny the Elder, a 1st century Roman author and military officer, drawing upon the accounts of Juba II, king of Mauretania, stated that a Roman expedition from Mauritania visited the islands of the archipelago of the Canaries and Madeira around 10 AD and found great ruins but no population, only dogs (from those animals he called the islands, using the latin word "canarius" or "canis" for dog).
According to Pliny the Elder, an expedition of Mauretanians sent by Juba II to the archipelago visited the islands: when King Juba II dispatched a contingent to re-open the dye production facility at Mogador (historical name of Essaouira, Morocco) in the early 1st century CE Juba's naval force was subsequently sent on an exploration of the Canary Islands, Madeira and probably the Cape Verde islands, using Mogador as their mission base.
We have even recorded historically that, according to Pliny the Elder, the Greek Xenophon of Lampsacus stated that the Gorgades (Cape Verde islands) were situated two days from "Hesperu Ceras" (today called Cap-Vert), the westernmost part of the African continent, showing a knowledge of the area by the Romans. They even knew of the Hesperides: some researchers, like Duane Roller, have even identified the Hesperides with the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean Sea.
Furthermore, according to Pliny the Elder and his citation by Gaius Julius Solinus, the sea voyage time crossing the Gorgades (Cape Verde islands) to the islands of the Ladies of the West ("Hesperides", actual São Tomé and Príncipe and Fernando Po) was around 40 days: this fact has created academic discussions about the possibility of further Roman travels toward Guinea and even the Gulf of Guinea. A Roman coin of the emperor Trajan has been found in Congo.
Aelius Gallus in 25 BCE led an expedition across the Red Sea against the Sabaeans of Arabia Felix (modern Yemen). In order to control Sabaea the Romans took control of both sides of the entrance to the Red Sea, the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, since Cornelius Gallus had established a garrison at Arsinoe (near Assab, in actual Eritrea) on the Ethiopian shore. 
This was the only Roman outpost in eastern Africa south of Egypt and lasted a few decades.
Emperor Augustus decided that the circumnavigation of Africa should also be attempted (in 1 BC). Romans had two naval ouposts in the Atlantic coast of Africa: Sala near present Rabat and Mogador in southern Maroc (north of Agadir). The island of Mogador prospered for the local exploitation of purple (highly esteemed in imperial Rome) from Augustus until Septimius Severus times. Augustus, based even in the discovery of a sunken merchant ship from southern Spain in the Djibuti area (done by his adoptive son Gaius Caesar when he sailed toward Aden), wanted to organize an expedition from Egypt to Mogador and Sala around Africa.
The eastern coast of Africa south of Egypt was at the center of a huge sea commerce between Rome and India through the Somalian coast.
Roman books such as the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea and Ptolomey's "Geography" list a string of market places (emporia) along this coast. Finds of Roman-era coins along the coast confirm the existence of this huge trade even in coastal Tanzania, and Ptolomey's Geography refers to a town of Rhapta as "metropolis" of a political entity called Azania near actual Zanzibar. Archaeologists have not yet succeeded in identifying the location of Rhapta, though many believe it lies deeply buried in the silt of the delta of the Rufiji River.
The scholar Felix Chami found archaeological evidence for extensive Roman trade on Mafija island near the Kenyan coast and, not far away, on the African mainland, near the mouth of the Rufiji River and the northern Mozambique coast, which he dated to the first few centuries AD.
Roman coins have been found in Zimbabwe and Madagascar, supporting the possibility that Roman vessels sailed south of Azania toward the area of the gold mines of the Zambesi river and the legendary Greater Zimbabwe kingdom.

The Steadfast Tin Soldier

"The Steadfast Tin Soldier" is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. The story was first published in Copenhagen, Denmark by C.A. Reitzel on 2 October 1838 in the first booklet of "Fairy Tales Told for Children." The booklet includes Andersen's "The Daisy" and "The Wild Swans". The story was Andersen’s first story not based upon a folk tale or a literary model. "The Steadfast Tin Soldier" has been adapted to various media including ballet and animated movie. 
The story tells of a tin soldier who loves a paper ballerina. He falls from the window in the toy room. After many adventures, he is returned to the toy room. A little boy throws the tin soldier in the fire. A breeze blows the paper ballerina into the fire. The two toys are destroyed together.
Joan G. Haahr writes in "The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales": "The story is unusual among Andersen's early tales, both in its emphasis on sensual desire and in its ambiguities. Blind fate, not intention, determines all events. Moreover, the narrative questions the very decorum it praises. The tin soldier's passive acceptance of whatever happens to him, while exemplifying pietistic ideals of self-denial, also contributes to his doom. Were he to speak and act, the soldier might gain both life and love. Restrained, however, by inhibition and convention, he finds only tragedy and death. The tale is often read autobiographically, with the soldier viewed as symbolizing Andersen's feelings of inadequacy with women, his passive acceptance of bourgeois class attitudes, or his sense of alienation as an artist and an outsider, from full participation in everyday life."

Billy the Kid is the story of a boy who has a dream to become a professional footballer. The book was published in 2000 and was written by Michael Morpurgo. It is illustrated by Michael Foreman.
Most of the book is set during World War II. Throughout the story, Billy, the main character, has to cope with a lot of sadness and loss. Whilst playing football in the local park, he is scouted by the club of his dreams: Chelsea FC. But his mood quickly changes when his brother dies in the war. This persuades Billy to join the army.
The idea for the book came about when Michael Foreman took Michael Morpurgo to a Chelsea game and pointed out the Chelsea pensioners, who get free tickets for every game. Morpurgo was fascinated to learn that one pensioner chose to pay for his ticket still so he could sit with the same fans he did during his childhood.

Abdominal compartment syndrome

Abdominal compartment syndrome occurs when the abdominal cavity (compartment) within the body becomes subject to increased pressure from within. This may be caused by internal bleeding, a blockage or fluid build-up in the intestines, or 'ascites' which is when fluid accumulates in the peritoneal cavity - the space between the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) and the abdominal organs (the stomach, small and large intestines, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder). 
This increased pressure causes the abdomen to distend or expand, stretching the skin and placing pressure on the abdominal organs, which can constrict the blood vessels which supply them. When the pressure reaches a level above that of the blood supply to the tissues and organs of the abdomen, ischemia will happen leading to organ dysfunction and eventually failure. 
An operation called a decompressive laparotomy may need to be performed, where an incision is made to open the abdominal cavity. The incision is typically left open for a period of time to reduce the pressure in the abdomen. 
Abdominal compartment syndrome can be divided into three categories:

Bogotá bag

A Bogotá bag is a sterile plastic bag used to temporarily close incisions in the abdomen. It is generally a sterilized, 3 liter urological irrigation fluid bag, that is sewn to the skin or fascia of the anterior abdominal wall. It is called a 'Bogotá bag' because it was first used by Oswaldo Borraez, a doctor in Bogotá, Colombia.
Temporary abdominal closure techniques are used to postpone definite closure until predisposing factors causing pathologic elevation of intra abdominal pressure are resolved. These techniques include the Bogota bag, absorbable mesh, vacuum pack dressings, the Wittmann patch or velcro burr and the KCI VAC or Abthera dressings.
Temporary abdominal closure techniques are most commonly used in cases of abdominal compartment syndrome in which decompressive laparotomy is necessary to reduce intra abdominal pressure to restore system perfusion. 
The Bogota bag acts as a hermetic barrier that avoids evisceration and loss of fluids. Another advantage to the Bogota bag, is that the abdominal contents can be visually inspected. 
The bogota bag can be used in cases of 'burst abdomen' following laparotomies, especially those using a midline horizontal incision. Burst abdomen is usually characterized by a serosanguinous pink discharge from the wound, 6–8 days after surgery

In "Metroid Fusion", Samus Aran is sent to the Biologic Space Laboratories space station because an explosion has happened there. The station contains X Parasites, viruses that can make a copy of the appearance and memories of living things that they are in. The Galactic Federation plans to capture the X Parasites to do further study of them. Because of how dangerous the X Parasites are, Samus has to destroy the space station to protect the federation from them.
Unlike other "Metroid" games, "Metroid Fusion" focuses more on storyline than on exploration. The gameplay focuses on puzzle solving, platform jumping, and shooting enemies. Players have to find power-ups to get to new areas. Samus is able to absorb X Parasites to regain health, bombs, and missiles. Abilities new to the "Metroid" series include grabbing ledges and climbing ladders.
"Metroid Fusion" can be connected to "Metroid Prime" with the Nintendo GameCube-Game Boy Advance cable to unlock new features in "Metroid Prime".

Locating (physics)

The act of locating something, of finding or defining the location of something, is a basic idea of modern science. In physics to say what "to locate" or "location" means, we must explain with clear talk how we do the job of locating something.
For things about our size, we generally use two beginning points that everybody knows about, and then we measure from those points to the thing we want to give a location. We might start with the Plymouth Rock and the Blarney Stone. We could then say, "Captain Smith's ship is 1400 miles from Plymouth Rock going toward the Blarney Stone." Or, in another case we might say, "Captain Jones's ship can be found by drawing a line from Plymouth Rock to the Blarney Stone, finding a point 700 miles along this line from Plymouth Rock, taking a left turn of 90° upon reaching this point from Plymouth Rock, and then traveling an additional 90 miles. 
If we have some good way of knowing compass directions, we can say something like, "Go three miles north of that big white rock over there and then go two miles east from that point. That is where I put the gold."
Finding the location of something is ordinarily done by seeing it somewhere, hearing it somewhere, feeling it somewhere, etc. Sometimes we know where something is by looking at a photograph, finding it with radar, or pinging it with sonar.
It is much more difficult to locate an electron, a photon, or anything else about that small. We may construct a light source that only makes one photon at a time. We can aim the light source at a piece of photographic film, let the light source make one photon, and then develop the photographic film. If we had very sensitive photographic film that could be darkened by only one photon, then we would find a tiny speck of silver where the photon ended up. A silver atom is much larger than a photon, so there would be some fuzziness about where the photon ended up, but people probably would agree that the photon must have ended up somewhere within the target formed by the silver atom. However, all we can say is that the photon must have been at that point when it ended its existence. When a photon is absorbed by an electron it gives its energy to the electron and disappears. So when it was briefly at some definite place it immediately lost all of its motion. 
Another way to locate a photon is to make it go through a small place. Knowing when the light source sends out a photon, and knowing the speed of light, we can know when it must be going through a hole in a plate put in the center of its path to the film. We can gradually get closer and closer to finding out exactly where it is in the middle of its flight. However, the path that it will take from there on becomes progressively wild. That is because when a photon goes through a hole like that it experiences diffraction.

Wayne County was one of the first counties formed when the Northwest Territory was created. It was named for the American general "Mad Anthony" Wayne. When it was created, the entire area of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan and small sections that are now part of northern Ohio, Indiana and Illinois were part of Wayne County. On August 15, 1796, the boundaries of Wayne County were set to begin at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River then west to Fort Wayne, then to the southernmost point of Lake Michigan and along the western shore north to the territorial boundary in Lake Superior and then along the territorial boundary through Lake Huron, Lake St. Clair, and Lake Erie back to the starting point.
On January 14, 1803, the Governor of Indiana Territory, William Henry Harrison, changed the boundary. This new boundary included Chicago, Illinois and a large strip of Wisconsin along Lake Michigan.
These boundaries were later changed again when Indiana and Illinois became states and as other counties were created in Michigan Territory.

When the Nintendo DS launched in 2004, it included an early demo of "Metroid Prime Hunters", which at that point was titled "Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt".
Like other titles in the "Metroid Prime" series, "Metroid Prime Hunters" is a first-person adventure game where the focus is on exploration and discovery. However, it differs from other titles in that there is no assisted aiming, a bigger focus on gameplay, and online multiplayer. Samus Aran, the main character that the player plays as, can access her gunship from anywhere. The game uses both screens of the Nintendo DS: the top screen is used to show Samus' health and the amount of a weapon remaining, while the bottom screen shows the radar. The player moves Samus with the D-pad, and aiming is done with the use of the touch screen on the Nintendo DS' bottom screen.
Online multiplayer can be played with up to four players. Players can play as Samus or one of six bounty hunters. Each bounty hunter has different forms and weapons. The game's host is able to set options for points and time limits, as well as determine whether or not players can use the radar. If less than four players join a game, computer-controlled characters are placed into the game. In multiplayer, the bottom screen shows the number of kills a player has made and the time remaining in the round.

Duecento is the name of the 13th century in the Italian language. It is related to the culture of the Pre-Renaissance in Italy.
The Duecento is considered the century before the beginning of the Italian Renaissance cultural movement in the Trecento. It is sometimes called "Early Proto-Renaissance".
One of the most important centres of art and architecture in this period is Florence, a political, economical and cultural pole of Italy. Other important cities were Pisa, Siena, Arezzo, Mantua and Perugia, all of them in the area of Tuscany.
In the Duecento Italy developed the music of the so called "Trovatori", including Sordello of Mantua. From them later developed the classical music of the Italian Renaissance. 
The main personalities in this century were: Dante Alighieri (considered the "father" of the Italian language); Guittone d'Arezzo; Cimabue; Giotto di Bondone; Guido da Siena; Nicola Pisano; Arnolfo di Cambio and others. Giotto, who was an Italian painter and architect from Florence, is generally thought of as the first in a line of great artists of the Italian Renaissance that stretched until Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo.
During the Duecento the religious figure of Saint Francis of Assisi dominated the Italian souls. His poem "Canticle of the Sun" is considered a precursor of Renaissance poetry

John Carver

John Carver ( 1584 1621) Carver was a passenger on the "Mayflower". He was a leader during the "Mayflower" voyage and signed the Mayflower Compact. He was also the first Governor of Plymouth Colony.
It is believed that Carver was from Doncaster in Yorkshire England. Carver was a Separatist who did not believe in the teachings of the Church of England.
Carver and his first wife Mary were members of the French Walloon church in Leiden, Netherlands. Their religion was also not allowed where they lived. "Mayflower" passenger Francis Cooke and his wife were also members of the French church in Leiden. So was Philip Delano. Delano would arrive in Plymouth in 1621 on the ship "Fortune". Carver was a deacon in Leiden about 1609 at about age 25, and was born sometime before 1584. Leiden church records show that Carver lost his first wife Mary and their child in 1609 
Carver then married Katherine White. She was a member of the Separatist church and was originally from Nottinghamshire. Carver became very involved in the Leiden church. He made close friendships with the leaders of the church, especially the pastor John Robinson. He also became friends with Robert Cushman who would play an important part in the plans for the "Mayflower" voyage.
The church members decided to travel to Virginia Colony, a place where they would be allowed to practice their religion.
William Brewster was in hiding from King James I. John Carver and Robert Cushman were chosen to make plans for the voyage. In 1617 Carver and Robert Cushman began talking to officials of the Virginia Company. 
These were London businessmen interested in making a profit from the New World. By June 1620, John Carver was in Southampton purchasing supplies for the "Mayflower" voyage, along with Christopher Martin. They agreed to pay for the "Mayflower" voyage.
Carver was very rich and provided much of his money to the church members, and for the Mayflower voyage.
The "Mayflower" left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.
Carver was very educated and was fair with everyone so the passengers chose him to be their leader on the "Mayflower". When they landed the people chose him to be their first governor.
Carver left the ship and went to the land to find a safe place where they all could live. William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Doty also went. Hopkins was very helpful. He had seen Native Americans during his time at Jamestown. On one trip Bradford said they set off in below freezing weather. Many of the men were ill, and when the set sail the salt spray froze on their coats. They saw Native Americans. They were cutting up a whale which was very large. When they saw the men coming toward them, the Indians ran. At night they tried to protect themselves from the cold and the Indians. 
Carver worked very hard with the other men to build houses to keep the people warm. He hunted and fished and helped to plant food.
During that time, a Native American called Samoset paid a visit to Plymouth Colony and then the chief Massasoit also arrived. Governor Carver worked out a peace treaty with them. On March 23, 1621, John Carver was again chosen to be Plymouth governor. The people said that John Carver was a man they well approved of.
In early April 1621, after working in the field on a hot day, Governor Carver complained of a pain in his head. He returned to his house to lie down. Within a few days he died. William Bradford stated that Carver, although a wealthy man had worked hard alongside everyone.
Thomas Weston was one of the men who helped to pay for the Pilgrims trip. He had criticism of the pilgrims for not loading up the returning "Mayflower" with furs and other goods to pay them back. Govenor William Bradford sent a letter telling them of all the troubles they had. He blamed Thomas Weston, and stated that Governor John Carver "had worked himself to death that spring and the loss of him and other industrious men lives cannot be valued at any price".
Carver is buried at Cole's Hill Burial Ground in Plymoth, Massachusetts.

<doc id="395129" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=395129" title="Blast injury">
Blast injury

A blast injury is a wound caused by direct or indirect exposure to an explosive blast. Physical blast injuries are divided into four categories, with a fifth for secondary illnesses caused by the blast, and a sixth category for the effects of associated post-blast psychological trauma such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The type and severity of injuries caused by an explosion depends on a variety of factors including type of explosion, force of the explosion, environment in which the explosion occurs, and how close to the explosion the person is.
An explosion results from the rapid release of energy. Explosions fall into four general categories:
Chemical:
A chemical explosion is the result of a rapid chemical reaction or change of state which causes the creation of large amount of heat and usually gas. There are various types of chemical explosions including natural gas explosions, dust explosions and those caused by explosives.
Explosives are categorized as high-order (HE) explosives or low-order (LE) explosives and they each cause different injury patterns. Only (HE) explosives produces a shock wave
Mechanical
Electrical
Nuclear
Blast injuries are divided into four classes of physical trauma primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. A fifth category, the quinary injuries, are those caused by toxic substances associated with the blast.
Primary injuries are caused by the explosion's shock waves. Air and fluid-filled internal organs are most commonly affected, but the blast wave may also cause external injuries such as traumatic amputation.
The structures of the internal ears are most often affected by the blast wave, with perforated ear drums the most common injury. The most common fatal injury in victims who survive the initial blast is blast lung. Blast lung can result in pulmonary contusions, bleeding and fluid build-up in the lungs with damage to airways and blood vessels.
Most casualties in an explosion are caused by secondary blast injuries. These injuries may be caused by fragments of the explosive device and other objects within the blast zone being propelled by the force of the explosion. These objects may strike any part of the body resulting in penetrating trauma. The severity of the penetrating trauma depends to a degree on the size of the object, the depth of penetration, and the part of the body hit.
Secondary blast injuries are common in deliberate explosions such as those caused by terrorist bombs. The bombs are often designed with objects such as nails, or ball bearings packed in and around the explosive device to act as shrapnel.
These injuries may also occur in accidental explosions - such as may occur in an industrial accident - when objects in the environment affected by the blast, such as shattered glass take the role of shrapnel.
Displacement of air by the explosion creates a blast wind that can throw victims against solid objects. Injuries resulting from this type of traumatic impact are referred to as tertiary blast injuries. Tertiary injuries may present as some combination of blunt and penetrating trauma, including bone fractures and coup contre-coup injuries.
Young children, because they weigh less than adults, are at particular risk of tertiary injury.
Quaternary injuries, include flash burns, crush injuries from falling debris and inhalation injuries, which may make existing respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD worse.
This category of blast injury has been added fairly recently to classify injuries, which often results in a hyperinflammatory state may due to exposure to the environmental contaminants associated with the various types of explosive blasts including, bacteria, chemicals and radiation ("dirty bombs") as well as adverse tissue reaction to fuel and metals in the blast.
The psychological trauma which may occur in explosive blast survivors includes post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A concussion sustained in a blast may also be a risk factor for developing PTSD independent of a person's psychological reaction to the witnessed event. Psychological trauma may also occur in the complete absence of physical injuries.
Neurotrauma can occur due to the mechanisms of one or more blast injury categories. Bleeding from injured organs such as lungs or bowel causes a lack of oxygen in all vital organs, including the brain. Damage of the lungs reduces the surface for oxygen uptake from the air, reducing the amount of the oxygen delivered to the brain. Tissue destruction initiates the synthesis and release of hormones or mediators into the blood which, when delivered to the brain, change its function. Irritation of the nerve endings in injured peripheral tissue and/or organs also significantly contributes to blast-induced neurotrauma.
Individuals exposed to blasts frequently have loss of memory for events before and after explosion, confusion, headache, impaired sense of reality, and reduced decision-making ability. Patients with brain injuries acquired in explosions often develop sudden, unexpected brain swelling and cerebral vasospasm despite continuous monitoring. However, the first symptoms of blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) may occur months or even years after the initial event, and are therefore categorized as secondary brain injuries. The broad variety of symptoms includes weight loss, hormone imbalance, chronic fatigue, headache, and problems in memory, speech and balance. These changes are often debilitating, interfering with daily activities. Because BINT in blast victims is underestimated, valuable time is often lost for preventive therapy and/or timely rehabilitation.

WHDH

WHDH is a television station in Boston, Massachusetts in the United States. It is owned by Sunbeam Television and shows programs from the NBC network. It is received on Channel 7 in eastern Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and southern New Hampshire.
In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there was another television station in Boston with the name WHDH-TV. That station aired on Channel 5 and is now called WCVB-TV. There is no relationship between the two stations.
Channel 7 in Boston went on the air June 21, 1948 as WNAC-TV. It is the second oldest television station in Boston, and the third oldest in the New England states. The first owner was General Tire, which later became RKO General. The station showed CBS network programs when it first went on the air. The station also showed some programs from the ABC network. However, when a new TV station in Boston, Channel 5, then known as WHDH-TV but now known as WCVB-TV, started in 1957, Channel 7 dropped all ABC programs, which were then aired on Channel 5. In 1961, Channel 7 and Channel 5 switched networks, and Channel 7 became an ABC station, and Channel 5 became the CBS station for Boston. In 1972, the two channels switched again, and Channel 7 returned to being a CBS station, and Channel 5 an ABC station.
On May 21, 1982, RKO General lost the license to broadcast and Channel 7 was taken over by New England Television on May 22. The channel was renamed WNEV-TV. New England Television bought a radio station known as WHDH in 1989, and in January, 1990, channel 7 was renamed WHDH-TV. On January 2, 1995, Channel 7 stopped showing CBS programs and began showing NBC programs. Before then, NBC programs were shown on WBZ-TV, Channel 4, which now shows CBS programs. The reason for this switch is because WBZ-TV's owners merged with the CBS network.
In 1993, the station was sold to Sunbeam Television. In July, 2010, Channel 7 officially dropped the -TV from its name, becoming just WHDH.

<doc id="395236" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=395236" title="Lawrence Welk">
Lawrence Welk

Lawrence Welk (March 11, 1903 – May 17, 1992) was an American musician, accordionist, bandleader, and television impresario, who hosted "The Lawrence Welk Show" from 1955 to 1982. His style came to be known as "champagne music".
In 1996, Welk was ranked #43 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.
Welk was born in Strasburg, North Dakota. Most people there spoke German, but also knew English. His parents were Ludwig and Christiana (Schwahn) Welk, who were ethnic Germans from Russia. They emigrated to America in 1892 from Selz, Kutschurgan District, in the German-speaking area north of Odessa (now Odessa, Ukraine, but then in southwestern Russia). In North Dakota, the family lived on a homestead.
Welk decided on a career in music and got his father to buy him an accordion from a mail order for $400 (equivalent to $ in ) He promised his father that he would work on the farm until he was 21, to pay his father back for the accordion. Any other money he earned during that time, by doing farmwork or performing, would go to his family.
On his 21st birthday, Welk left the family's farm to start his career in music. During the 1920s, he performed with the Luke Witkowski, Lincoln Boulds, and George T. Kelly bands before he started his own orchestra. He led big bands in North Dakota and eastern South Dakota. These included the Hotsy Totsy Boys and later the Honolulu Fruit Gum Orchestra. His band also played for radio station WNAX in Yankton, South Dakota. In 1927, he graduated from the MacPhail School of Music in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
During the 1930s, Welk led a traveling big band that played dance tunes and "sweet" music. At first, the band traveled around the country by car. They were too poor to rent rooms, so they usually slept and changed clothes in their cars. At an engagement at the William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh, a dancer said that Welk's band's sound was as "light and bubbly as champagne," which is where the term "Champagne Music" came from. Welk described his band's sound, saying "We still play music with the champagne style, which means light and rhythmic. We place the stress on melody; the chords are played pretty much the way the composer wrote them. We play with a steady beat so that dancers can follow it."
Welk's big band performed across the country but mostly at ballrooms and hotels in the Chicago and Milwaukee areas. In the early 1940s, the band started to play at the Trianon Ballroom in Chicago, where they played for 10 years. His orchestra also played at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City during the late 1940s. Welk recorded a version of Spade Cooley's "Shame on You" with Western artist Red Foley in 1945. The record (Decca 18698) was #4 on Billboard's September 15 "Most Played Juke Box Folk Records" listing. From 1949 through 1951, the band had its own national radio program on ABC.
Sometimes, Welk's band made recordings in Richmond, Indiana and in Grafton, Wisconsin for the Gennett and Paramount companies. In November, 1928, he recorded for Gennett and in 1931, he recorded for Paramount. These records are very rare.
From 1938 to 1940, he recorded in New York and Chicago for the Vocalion label. He started with Decca in 1941, and recorded for Mercury and Coral before starting with Dot in the early 1950s.
In 1966, his orchestra recorded an album on the Ranwood Records label, with Jazz saxophonist Johnny Hodges, featuring a number of Jazz standards, including "Someone to Watch Over Me", "Misty" and "Fantastic, That's You". The album has been out of print for many years.
In 1951, Welk moved to Los Angeles. The same year, he began hosting "The Lawrence Welk Show". It was broadcast from the Aragon Ballroom in Venice Beach. The show became a local hit and was picked up by ABC in June 1955.
The show had a "bubble machine." Whenever the orchestra played a polka or waltz, Welk himself would dance with the band's female singer, called a "Champagne Lady" on the show. His first Champagne Lady was Jayne Walton Rosen (her real name was Dorothy Jayne Flanagan). Rocky Rockwell would usually sing novelty songs. Welk would also have one song each show where he would play an accordion solo.
Welk's show would rarely play current music, except as a novelty. On the December 8, 1956 show, the show did play two current songs. They were "Nuttin' for Christmas," and Elvis Presley's "Don't Be Cruel."
The songs on the show were mostly popular music standards, polkas, and novelty songs. Welk often danced with women from the audience.
Welk had very high quality musicians, including accordionist Myron Floren, concert violinist Dick Kesner, guitarist Buddy Merrill, and New Orleans Dixieland clarinetist Pete Fountain. He paid his regular band members very well, and it was common for them to stay with the band a long time. For example, Floren was the band's assistant conductor throughout the whole time the show was broadcast.
The show didn't only play big-band era music. During the 1960s and 1970s, for example, the show played music that was originally by The Beatles, Burt Bacharach and Hal David, The Everly Brothers and Paul Williams and others, but in a style his older viewers would like. The show was originally in black and white. It changed to color in fall 1965.
While it was on network television, "The Lawrence Welk Show" aired on ABC on Saturday nights at 9 p.m. (Eastern Time), but changed to 8:30 p.m. in fall 1963. From 1956 to 1959, it was also known as "The Dodge Dancing Party", because Welk was also hosting another show called "Top Tunes and New Talent" on Mondays. ABC canceled the show in 1971, but it continued on 250 stations across the country until 1982.
Welk was married for 61 years, until he died, to Fern Renner (b. August 26, 1903, d. February 13, 2002). They had three children.
Welk was an excellent businessman. He had investments in real estate and music publishing, and was a general partner in a commercial real estate development. 
Welk had four US design patents:
Welk was a Roman Catholic and a daily communicant.
After he retired in 1982, Welk continued to air reruns of his shows. He was also in two Christmas specials in 1984 and 1985.
Welk died from bronchopneumonia in Santa Monica, California, in 1992 at age 89. He was buried in Culver City's Holy Cross Cemetery.

In 1994, Welk was inducted into the International Polka Music Hall Of Fame.

Super Monkey Ball

Super Monkey Ball is a platform video game. It was developed by Amusement Vision and published by Sega. It was first released in Japan in January 2001 as an arcade game titled "Monkey Ball". It had a joystick in the shape of a banana. It was later released worldwide as a launch title for the Nintendo GameCube. Titled "Super Monkey Ball", it was released in Japan on September 4, 2001, in North America on November 18, 2001, and in Europe on May 3, 2002. 
"Super Monkey Ball" has three modes of gameplay: Main game, party games, and mini-games.
In the main game, the object is to guide a monkey in a hamster ball across a series of platforms in the air and through a goal at the end of the level. Four monkeys are available for the player to play as. Each level is timed; with a level running for either 30 or 60 seconds. The player controls the main game with the GameCube controller's control stick. By moving the stick, the whole level moves, and the ball rolls in the direction that the level moves. Each level has bananas that the player can collect. Bananas give the player points, and collecting a certain amount of them gives the player an extra life. Should the player fall off of the level, known as a "fall out," the player loses a life. There are three main difficulties: Beginner, Advanced, and Expert. Beginner is ten easy levels, Advanced is 30 harder levels, and Expert is 50 very difficult levels. Should the player meet a certain condition after completing a difficulty, they will be able to play the difficulty's "extra" levels. A fourth difficulty level, Master, can be unlocked by completing the Expert and Expert Extra levels without using a continue. Master is the hardest difficulty level, with ten levels.
There are three party games: Monkey Race, Monkey Target, and Monkey Fight. In Monkey Race, players race on one of several racing levels, competing for the best rank. In Monkey Target, players roll their monkey down a ramp and open the monkey's ball to fly in order to land on one of several islands. Three levels are available to play on. In Monkey Fight, players punch other monkeys for points. When time runs out, whichever monkey has the most points wins.
There are three minigames that can to be unlocked with points gotten in the main game: Monkey Bowling, Monkey Billiards, and Monkey Golf. Each minigame is based on the real life sport.

Prudence Crandall

Prudence Crandall (September 3, 1803 – January 28, 1890) was an American teacher. She was born on September 3, 1803 to Quakers. She went to the New England Friends’ Boarding School in Providence, Rhode Island. In October 1831, she opened a private girls’ school in Canterbury, Connecticut. In 1833, an African American girl was admitted to the school. The parents of the white girls in the school wanted the black girl expelled. Crandall refused. She opened a school for African American girls in April 1833. 
The Connecticut legislature passed the "Black Law". This law made it illegal to open a school that taught African American pupils from a state other than Connecticut. Crandall was arrested, tried, and convicted of violating this law. She was put in jail. A higher court reversed the decision. Crandall was freed, but neighbors harassed her. They smashed the windows in the school. Crandall feared for the students’ safety. She closed the school in 1834. 
Crandall married Baptist minister and abolitionist Calvin Philleo. In 1835, the couple and his three children left Connecticut for Philleo’s farm in New York State. They later moved to Illinois. Here Crandall ran a school from her home. She also took part in women’s rights activities. When Philleo died in 1874, Prudence moved to Kansas to live with her brother. In 1886, the Connecticut legislature gave her a pension. Crandall died on January 28, 1890. She was buried in Kansas. Her old school house in Canterbury is now the Prudence Crandall Museum. In 1995, Crandall was named Connecticut's state heroine.

William Bradford (Mayflower passenger)

William Bradford (15901657) was a passenger on the "Mayflower" in 1620. He travelled to the New World to live in religious freedom. He became the second Governor of Plymouth Colony and served for over 30 years. Bradford kept a journal of the history of the early life in Plymouth Colony. It is called "Of Plymouth Plantation".
Bradford was born to William and Alice Bradford in Austerfield, Yorkshire, England. His family were farmers. The Bradford family owned a large farm and were considered rich.
Bradford's father died was he was one year old. When he was four years old he was sent to live with his grandfather. Two years later, his grandfather died and he returned to live with his mother and stepfather. A year later, in 1597, his mother died. Bradford became an orphan at age 7. He was sent to live with two uncles.
His uncles wanted Bradford to help on the farm but Bradford was ill and was not able to work. Bradford started to read many books. One of the books was the Bible. This may be where he started learning of a religion that was different from the church of England.
When Bradford was 12 years old he went with a friend to hear the pastor Richard Clyfton. Clyfton was a minister who did not believe in the Church of England. Bradford believed in Clyfton’s words. His uncles told him not to go to that church but he went anyway.
During one meeting he became friends with William Brewster. Brewster did not live far away and Bradford borrowed books from him about the new church.
King James I of England started to punish the people who did not follow the Church of England. They were called Separatists. By 1607 many members of the Separatists were arrested. Brewster was made to pay a fine for going to the church. Some members were put into prison and others were watched night and day. The people also learned that other Separatists in London had been put into prison and left to starve to death.
The Separatists decided to leave England for the Dutch Republic (where religious freedom was permitted). William Bradford went with them. It was illegal to leave England. The group was betrayed by an English sea captain who brought them to the English authorities. Most of the congregation, and Bradford, were put into prison. By the summer of 1608, the Separatists, and William Bradford, escaped to Leiden, Netherlands. Bradford was 18.
 William Bradford moved to Amsterdam in August 1608. He lived with the Brewsters in Stink Alley. The Separatists had spent most of their money leaving England and were poor. After nine months, the congregation moved to the smaller city of Leiden.
When Bradford turned 21 he received some money. Bradford purchased his own house. He built a workshop and worked as a weaver. He was liked.
In 1613, Bradford married Dorothy May, the daughter of a rich English couple living in Amsterdam. In 1617, the Bradfords had their first child, John Bradford.
By 1617, the Separatists decided to travel to Virginia Colony in North America. The Separatists could practice their religion in the Dutch Republic, they wanted their children to keep their English customs and language. The colonists made a business arrangement with the Merchant Adventurers. These were a group of men who were willing to pay for the Pilgrims to go to the New World with the promise that the pilgrims would pay them back with furs and other goods they got from the colony. By July 1620, Robert Cushman and John Carver had made the plans and fifty Separatists left Delftshaven on the ship "Speedwell".
Many families were split as some Separatists stayed behind in the Netherlands, planning to make the voyage to the New World after the colony had been established. William and Dorothy Bradford left their three-year-old son John with Dorothy's parents in Amsterdam, possibly because he was too frail to make the voyage.
The "Speedwell" planned to meet with the "Mayflower" and both ships would travel to Virginia Colony. The "Speedwell" proved unsafe and the passengers were put on the "Mayflower". This made the ship very crowded. Not all the passengers were Separatists. There were about 50 colonists who went because they had certain skills. These skills would prove useful on the "Mayflower" and at the colony. Bradford said they hugged each other and cried and said goodbye to family and friends for the last time. They knew they were pilgrims and lifted their eyes to heaven, their dearest country and this comforted them.
The Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" spotted land. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.
They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. Bradford signed the Mayflower Compact.
Up to this time, Bradford, aged 30, had never been a leader in the colony. When the "Mayflower" anchored in the Harbor, the men went out to explore the land for a place where they could live. Bradford volunteered to be a member of the exploration parties. In November and December, these parties went out three times on foot and by boat.
One of the earliest exploration missions included William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Doty. Of this group Hopkins was the most experienced, having seen Indians during his time at Jamestown. According to Bradford, they set off in below freezing weather, many of the men already being ill, "and when the set sail the salt spray froze on their coats, as if they had been glazed". During their trip they saw Indians who looked like they were cutting up a large whale. When the Indians saw the men they ran away. The men camped and protected themselves from the cold and the Indians.
They located a place that would be Plymouth Colony in December. During the first expedition on foot, Bradford was caught up in a deer trap made by Native Americans and brought upside down. During the third exploration, on 6 December 1620, Bradford and the other men found Plymouth Bay. A winter storm nearly sank their boat as they came near the bay. The explorers were very cold and started to get sick. The waves were high but they landed on Clark's Island.
During this time, they searched areas all around the bay and found a place to live and build their homes. The location had a large hill. This hill is now called Burial Hill. It was a good place to build a fort for safety against any possible enemies. There were many brooks providing water. They would later find out that the site had been the location of a Native American village known as Patuxet; and that is why a large area had already been cleared for planting of food. The Patuxet tribe of Indians, between 1616 and 1619, had all died from bad sickness. Bradford later wrote that bones of the dead were easy to find in many places.
The "Mayflower" arrived in Plymouth Bay on 20 December 1620. The settlers began building the colony's first house on 25 December.
On January 11, 1621, as Bradford was helping to build houses when he was got a great pain in his hipbone and fell. Bradford was taken to the "common house" (the only house that was finished) and they thought he would die that night, but he did not.
Bradford got well but many of the pilgrims were not so fortunate. During the months of February and March 1621 sometimes two or three people died every day. By the end of the winter, half of the 100 settlers had died. They buried their dead in secret so the Native Americans would not see how many were dying. They buried them in Cole's Hill and tried to also hide the graves from the animals.
There were only a small number of men who were healthy. Everyone, including the children had to work and care for the sick. One of these was Captain Myles Standish. He was a soldier who had been hired by the settlers to protect the people of the colony. Standish cared for Bradford during his illness. They became good friends. Bradford had no military experience and when he became governor he would come to trust Captain Standish's advice on military matters.
William was chosen by the people to be Governor of Plymouth Colony. He kept journals (a written record) which are very important even today because they are the only history of how the Mayflower passengers and their families lived in Plymouth Colony. He died before he could finish the second book.
On March 16, the settlers had their first meeting with the Native Americans who lived in the region. Samoset, an Indian walked into the village of Plymouth and greeted them in English. Samoset had learned some English from the traders who had visited the area he was from. This soon led to a visit by Massasoit, the leader of the Pokanoket tribe. At that meeting, Massassoit made a treaty with Governor John Carver. The treaty said that they would be friends and protect each other against unfriendly Indians.
Bradford wrote down what was said. He would soon become governor and the treaty that was very important was the promise to help each other. This agreement was not liked by Massasoit's enemies in other tribes.
In April 1621, Governor Carver became sick while working in the fields on a hot day. He died a few days later. The settlers of Plymouth then chose Bradford as the new governor. Bradford would remain governor most of his life.
The elected leadership of Plymouth Colony was at first a governor and an assistant governor. The assistant governor for the first three years of the colony's history was Isaac Allerton. In 1624, it was changed to five assistants. This was called the "governor's council". These men gave advice to the governor and had a vote on important matters. They helped Bradford in managing the Colony. Assistants during the early years of the colony included Thomas Prence, Stephen Hopkins, John Alden, and John Howland.
William Bradford married Dorothy in Amsterdam, Holland on December 10, 1613. They had one son. Dorothy fell from the deck of the Mayflower into the water and drowned a short time after the ship landed. Her husband was on an exploring mission. John was born in Leiden, Holland and died in 1620.
His second wife was Alice Southwarth in Plymouth. They had three children. She died in Plymouth in March 1670 and was buried on Burial Hill in Plymouth near her husband.
Bradford's wrote "Of Plymouth Plantation". It was a history about Plymouth colony. It is often called a journal. It was a collection of what he saw and what he thought was important. This was written in two books. The first book was written in 1630 but the second was never finished. During the years 1646 and 1650, he wrote about the colony's history up to 1646.
In "Of Plymouth Plantation", Bradford saw what was happening to be like what happened in the Bible. As Philip Gould writes, "Bradford hoped to show the workings of God to future generations." The book was not published until 1656, the year before his death, and it was well liked. Bradford has been called the father of American history. Many American authors have put what Bradford said in their books. Thomas Prence did so in his book named "A Chronological History of New-England in the Form of Annals." Today it is considered very important and studied in American schools and colleges. Bradford's journal was included in another work entitled "Mourt's Relation". This was written in part by Edward Winslow, and made into a book in England in 1622.

Homeless Bird

Homeless Bird is a story about a 13 year old girl named Koly.
Koly is a 13 year-old girl who lives in India. Based off of the Indian tradition, her family has made an arranged marriage for her. Her husband is a sickly, young boy named Hari. Once they are married Koly must go to live with his family. But soon when Koly finds out that Hari has tuberculosis and he will die very soon. So the parents of Hari had decide to take Hari to the Ganges River and Koly comes along too. While going to the city of the Ganges River, Hari dies. When Hari dies, Koly becomes a widow. Koly's sassur (father- in-law) is a kind man who teaches students. He teaches Koly to read and shows her a book of poems signed by the author Tagore. Koly's sass (mother-in-law) is not a nice woman. She treats Koly as just another mouth to feed.
Hari's sister Chandra is soon married. Koly is sad because Chandra was her friend and now she is leaving. Soon Koly's sassur dies and now both Koly and her sass are widows. 
Sass and Koly are very poor. One day Sass gets a letter from her brother inviting them to live with him in Delhi. They make a stop in Vrindavan to pray at a temple. They take a rickshaw to the temple. Sass gives Koly money to buy lunch. Koly goes to buy the food but when she goes back to the temple her sass is not there. She looks around and cannot find her. Finally she sees the rickshaw driver. He tells her that her sass left on a train hours ago.
Koly cries because her sass has left her. The rickshaw driver says to go to the temple and pray so the monks will give her food. Koly is very unhappy and scared. She sees the rickshaw driver again and he offers to bring her to a house for widows. At the home Koly meets a nice widow named Tanu. Together they find jobs making marigold garlands and beaded bracelets. However, Koly's talent is embroidery. She finally gets a job embroidering. Her new boss' name is Mr. Das.
Koly also teaches the rickshaw driver, Raji, how to read. Raji owns a farm and drives rickshaws for money. They talk and become friends. However he leaves to fix his farm.
At her new job, Koly makes friends with a girl named Mala. Mala is good at embroidery but very outspoken. Mala also steals expensive cloth and thread from Mr. Das. This later causes Mala to lose her job.
Raji comes back and tells Koly that he is fixing up his farm and building a home. He wants Koly to come to his farm with him. She is confused until Raji says he wants her as his wife. Koly is surprised that Raji wants to marry her because she is poor. However Raji wants to marry Koly because he does not care about money and only wants someone he can talk to. Koly is still unsure but agrees to write to him.
Tanu and Koly finally have enough money to buy a room for more widows to live in. Koly decorates the room with embroidered quilts.
In the summer Raji writes that he has built a room for her work on her embroidery. Koly is happy and agrees to marry him. She works on a wedding quilt and says they will marry when she is done embroidering it.
Koly, just like the homeless bird in one of the Tagore poems, has finally found her home.

Anne Hutchinson

Anne Hutchinson (baptized July 20, 1591 - August or September 1643), was a religious dissenter in Puritan New England. She was the defendant in the most famous of the trials intended to suppress religious dissent in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. She was born Anne Marbury in Alford, Lincolnshire, England. She, her husband William, and their children left England for the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1634. Once settled, she began holding weekly meetings in her home to discuss sermons and theology.
Her religious views did not agree with those of her Puritan neighbors. They believed good works were necessary for salvation. Hutchinson believed that only faith (Sola fide) was necessary. She also believed that God revealed himself to people without the help of the clergy. Community leaders viewed Hutchinson as a threat. She was found guilty of heresy in 1637, and told to leave the colony.
Hutchinson and her family moved first to Rhode Island. After her husband's death in 1642, she settled near present-day Pelham Bay on Long Island Sound. In 1643, Hutchinson, all her children except one, and all her servants were killed in an attack perpetrated by Native Americans. Her death was regarded by some in Massachusetts Bay as evidence of divine judgment.

Central Cross-Island Highway

The Central Cross-Island Highway () or Provincial Highway No.8 is one of three highway systems that connect the east and west coasts of Taiwan.
Construction of the Central Cross-Island Highway began on July 7, 1956 and it first opened to traffic on May 9, 1960.
The highway begins in the west at Dongshi District in Taichung. The highway used to go up into the Central Mountain Range along the Dajia River () valley through the townships of Guguan () and Cingshan (). At Lishan there is a branch that heads north to Yilan City. It goes through the mountains to Dayuling () which is the highest point of the route. Here another branch of the highway runs south from Dayuling to Wushe (). Continuing east from Dayuling, the highway goes down into Taroko National Park. It passes through Guanyuan (), Cih-en (), Luoshao () and Tiansiang () before entering Taroko Gorge. After the gorge the road then meets the eastern coastal Su'ao-Hualien Highway.
The highway goes through mountains. Rocks often fall and there can be landslides. Heavy rain from typhoons often push soil and rocks onto the highway so people can drive through parts of it. Earthquakes also damage the highway. On September 21, 1999 the Jiji earthquake caused a lot of damage to the highway and cut it in many places between Dongshih and Lishan.
There was so much damage in 1999 that repairing it would cost a lot of money. The damaged parts of the highway were supposed to re-open in 2004. However, heavy rain from the Typhoon Mindulle added more damage to the highway. These parts were closed. The highway is still closed between Lishan and Guguan.

Azorina vidalii

The Azorina vidalii (Azores Bellflower) is the only species of the genus "Azorina" within the Campanulaceae, the bellflower family. This endemic species of the Azores is used as an ornamental plant in other countries besides the Azores.
It was first given the name "Campanula vidalii" by Hewett Cottrell Watson in "Hooker's Icones Plantarum", table DCLXXXIV (684); Watson gave it the specific name "vidalii" after "Capt. Vidal, R.N.", who collected the original plant. Heinrich Feer changed the name to "Azorina vidalii", creating a new genus "Azorina", in "Botanische Jahrbücher für Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie", 12, S. 611.
The Azores bellflower is an evergreen, perennial herbaceous plant that grows to a height of 80 to 150 centimetres. It produces branches at the base and these branches are woody in the lower part. The plant has dark green leaves.
The plant flowers from May to October. The inflorescence has many hanging, waxy, pale pink, bell-shaped flowers . The "Azorina vidalii" forma "alba" has, as the name suggests, white flowers. 
The Azores bellflower is rare and usually grows in holes in cliffs near the sea, below the 50 metres of altitude. It is usually accompanied by the plant "Salicornia", which also tolerate the salt in the wind coming from the sea. The plant is found in all the islands of the Azores archipelago, but not on the island of Graciosa.

Mars in fiction

Novels and short stories about Mars have been popular for over a hundred years. The planet's dramatic red color that some people can see is one reason for this. another is that the planet is close to Earth. Also, it looks somewhat like Earth. There are also stories about creatures from Mars on Earth and elsewhere.
Near the end of the 19th century, the astronomer 
Giovanni Schiaparelli reported seeing what he thought might be water channels on Mars. Because the Italian for channels is "canali", English translations tended to render the word as "canals", implying artificial construction. This led to the idea of intelligent beings on Mars before it apparently dried up.
The following works of fiction deal with the planet itself, with any assumed Martian civilization as part of its planetary landscape.
Several early modern writers, including Athanasius Kircher and Emanuel Swedenborg, hypothesized contact with Mars. Early science fiction about Mars often involved the first voyages to the planet, sometimes as an invasion force, more often for the purposes of exploration.
By the 1930s, stories about reaching Mars had become somewhat trite, and the focus shifted to Mars as an alien landscape. In the following stories, human contact and basic exploration had taken place sometime in the past; Mars is a setting rather than a goal.
Beginning in 1965, the Mariner and Viking space probes revealed that the canals were an illusion, and that the Martian environment is extremely hostile to life. By the 1970s, the ideas of canals and ancient civilizations had to be abandoned.
Authors soon began writing stories based on the new Mars (frequently treating it as a desert planet). Most of these works have humans struggling to tame the planet, and some of them refer to terraforming (using technology to transform a planet's environment).
A common theme, particularly among American writers, is that of a Martian colony fighting for independence from Earth. It appeared already in Heinlein's "Red Planet" and is a major plot element in Greg Bear's "Moving Mars" and Kim Stanley Robinson's "Mars" trilogy. It is also part of the plot of the movie "Total Recall" and the television series "Babylon 5". Many video games also use this concept, such as the "Red Faction" and "Zone of the Enders" series. A historical rebellion of Mars against Earth is also mentioned in the "Star Trek" series of novels.
In the decades following Mariner and Apollo, the once-popular subgenre of realistic stories about a first expedition to Mars fell out of fashion, possibly due to the failure of the Apollo Program to continue on to Mars. The early 1990s saw a revival and re-envisioning of realistic novels about Mars expeditions. Early novels in this renaissance were Jack Williamson's novel "Beachhead" and Ben Bova's novel "Mars" (both 1992), which envisioned large-scale expeditions to Mars according to the thinking of the 1990s. These were followed by Gregory Benford's "The Martian Race" (1999), Geoffrey A. Landis's "Mars Crossing" (2000), and Robert Zubrin's "First Landing" (2002), which took as their starting points the smaller and more focussed expedition strategies evolved in the late 1990s, mostly building on the concepts of Mars Direct.
Several post-Mariner works are homages to the older phase of Mars fiction, circumventing the scientific picture of a dry and lifeless Mars with an unbreathable atmosphere through such science fiction generic staples as positing its future terraforming, or creating alternate history versions of Mars, where Burroughs' Barsoom, Bradbury's Martian Chronicles or The War of the Worlds are literal truth.
The Martian is a favorite character of classical science fiction; he was frequently found away from his home planet, often invading Earth, but sometimes simply a lonely character representing alienness from his surroundings. Martians, other than human beings transplanted to Mars, became rare in fiction after Mariner, except in exercises of deliberate nostalgia – more frequently in some genres, such as comics and animation, than in written literature.

Muscular system

The muscular system is one of the major systems in our body. Its main purpose is to produce movement. Muscle is a tissue in animal bodies. Muscles help us to move our body parts.
The skeleton and the muscles which move it are known as the musculoskeletal system.
There are three kinds of muscles:
Muscle action can be classified as being either "voluntary" or "involuntary".
The skeletal muscles move the limbs (arms and legs). They move the jaw up and down so that food can be chewed. Skeletal muscles are the only "voluntary" muscles. This means they are the only muscle that you can choose to move.
The cardiac muscle is the muscle in the heart. When this muscle contracts (makes itself smaller) it pushes blood through the circulatory system. The cardiac muscle is "not" voluntary. Animals do not choose for their heart to contract.
The smooth muscles are the other muscles in the body that are involuntary. Smooth muscles are in many places. They are in:
Muscles are made of many muscle cells. The cells contract together to make the muscle get shorter. The muscle cells know to do this together because many of them get information sent to them by nerves. Then cells that get the message from nerves tell other cells that are near them. They tell the other cells by sending an electrical current.
Muscle cells are filled with proteins called actin and myosin. These are the proteins that make the muscle contract (get shorter.)
When a nerve tells a muscle to contract, the muscle opens holes in its cell membrane. These holes are proteins that are called "calcium channels". Then calcium ions rush into the cell. Calcium also comes out of a special place in the cell called the "sarcoplasmic reticulum". This calcium sticks to the specialized proteins actin and myosin. This triggers these proteins to contract the muscle.
Contraction also needs ATP. This is the energy that your cells use. It is made from using glucose in the cell. It takes a lot of energy to release contracted muscles. They use most of the energy for building muscles.
Exercise makes muscles get bigger (see hypertrophy). Exercise also makes muscles stronger. If a person does not exercise, their muscles "atrophy". This means their muscles get smaller and weaker.
There are many different kinds of muscle diseases. There are three big groups of diseases:

Urðarbrunnr

Urðarbrunnr (Old Norse for the "Well of Urðr") is a well in Norse mythology. It is situated under the Yggdrasil or the world tree. Norse mythology is a version of the older northern Germanic mythology. The gods would travel via the biofrost with the exception of Thor as it was thought that he would break the bridge which took the form of a rainbow, to Urðarbrunnr. Here they would meet and decide things, presumably laws of nature and magic and love and war.

Mario Party 5

Mario Party 5 is a party board video game for the Nintendo GameCube console. It is the fifth game in the "Mario Party" series. It was developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo. It was released on November 10, 2003 in North America, on November 28, 2003 in Japan, and on December 5, 2003 in Europe.
"Mario Party 5" plays the same as the first four "Mario Party" games. Players go around on boards to collect coins, which they can use to buy stars. Movement is done with the use of a dice block with the numbers one through ten. After all four players take their turns, a mini-game is played. The player that wins the mini-game wins coins. The winner is the player with the most stars at the end of the game. Boards have different types of spaces, including blue spaces which add coins, red spaces which take away coins, and Bowser Spaces which causes Bowser to appear and do a bad event. The game introduces the DK Space, where Donkey Kong appears to cause an event to happen. Unlike Bowser events, these events are always good. Also new to the game is the Capsule system, which replaces the item system from past games. Capsules are containers that hold a single item. Players can get capsules by passing by the "Capsule Machine" on the board. Each capsule does something different, including increasing the number of dice blocks a player can roll, and taking away coins from an opponent. Capsules can be thrown up to ten spaces away. 
Ten characters are playable. New to the series as a playable character are Toad, Boo, and Koopa Kid. Because of the addition of the DK Space, Donkey Kong is no longer a playable character.
In addition to the main party game, players can also play a mode called Super Duel Mode. In Super Duel Mode, players build a battle vehicle to use in tournaments or fight against friends. Players are able to change their vehicle by using different parts. Parts can be bought with the points from mini-games.

Valley Forge National Historical Park (est. 1976) is a United States National Historical Park 25 miles north of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The park covers 3,500 acres. It contains historical buildings, recreated cabins, museums, memorials, and recreation facilities. The park welcomes visitors and gives talks about the history of the site.
It was at Valley Forge that General George Washington quartered the American Continental Army during the bitterly cold winter of 1777–1778. Many soldiers suffered or died of cold, sickness, and starvation. Valley Forge was not a battlefield. Washington wrote on February 16, 1778, "Naked and starving as they are we cannot enough admire the incomparable patience and fidelity of the soldiery."

Chill-out music

Chill-out music began in Europe during the early-1990s. 
It is an umbrella term for different types of electronic music that are meant to have a mellow style as well as mid-tempo beats. Ambient, ambient house, trip-hop, nu jazz, New Age and some other sub-genres of downtempo are mainly associated with chill-out music.
The music genre is played in "chill rooms" at dance clubs to allow dancers a chance to "chill out" from the more vigorous and fast-tempo type of music that is played on the main dance floor. In 1992, a UK regulation required dance clubs to have chill-out rooms and free water because of a number of Ecstasy-related injuries and deaths.

<doc id="395910" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=395910" title="Nitro compound">
Nitro compound

A nitro compound is a molecule that has the nitro group. The nitro group is made of one nitrogen atom connected with two oxygen atoms (-NO). The nitrogen is also bonded to the rest of the molecule.
Nitrogen normally has only three bonds. In a nitro group, it is considered positively charged. Then one of the oxygen is negatively charged, and the other has a double bond. In reality, the best way to represent the nitro group is to consider it to have delocalized electrons. Then all three atoms are sp hybridised.
Nitro compounds are very explosive. This is because, at high temperature, they can decompose and release nitrogen gas. This reaction is very exothermic (gives out a lot of energy). Many explosives have nitro groups, for example trinitrotoluene (TNT).

Trams in Biel

There was a tram system in Biel, Switzerland, from 1877 to 1948. As the idea of having trams was not popular, there was only one route from Bözingen to Nidau.
The tram was originally a horse carriage on rails. There were only a few carriages from other tram systems. Although it was very small there were summer and winter carriages.
After Biel City bought the system in 1901, it became electrical with more carriages and a bigger route. The tram was not very popular and the owner did not earn much money. This was the reason why only very few routes were built.
All the four routes started at the train station in Biel, today known as ‘Zentralplatz’. The tram to Meinisberg went through Mett but because there was a big distance between Biel and Meinisberg, there were only a few stations.
Biel City started to reduced the system in 1930. First, route 1 and 2 became route 1. Then, in 1940, routes 2 and 3 were replaced by buses and finally, route 1 became a bus route, too.
Biel has a well-organized bus system since 1948. It grew more and more and is quite large, with over 15 different routes today. Some of them use the old tram routes but more were added, especially in the last 20 years. There are also different bus types today. Some are electrical, others run on fuel.

Italophilia

Italophilia is the admiration, general appreciation or love of Italy, its culture, society, arts and people. It is often related to the emulation of Italy's ideals and civilization.
The term is used in two basic contexts: in international politics and in cultural context.
"Italophilia", "Italophile", and "Italophilic" are the terms used to denote pro-Italian sentiments, usually in politics and literature.
A huge italophilia started to develop in Europe during the centuries of the Italian Renaissance.
Actually one of the main reasons of Italophilia in the world is that Italy is home to more World Heritage Sites than any other nation in the world. These sites are culturally important and value according to UNESCO. Indeed about 60% of the works of art of the world are in Italy.
Another reason is the worlwide appreciation for Italian culinary and foods. Italy is also a big wine producer. In 2005 it made over 5 million tonnes, and many italian wines are very famous in the world, like the "Chianti".
Indeed in the American countries with a huge Italian emigration in the last centuries, there it is a widespread italophilia: Argentina, Brasil, Uruguay, Canada and the USA have millions of Italian descendants who promote in their society the love and appreciation for Italy.
Actually Giorgio Silvestri (director of the "Assemblea legislativa della Liguria") has calculated that there are nearly 250 million italophiles in the world.

Organolithium reagent

Organolithium compounds contain a direct bond between a carbon atom and a lithium atom. They are an important class of organometallic compound. The bonding between the carbon and lithium is highly polar due to the difference in electronegativity between these atoms, which effectively makes the carbon negatively charged and capable of acting as a strong base or nucleophile. These compounds are similar to Grignard reagents, but are much more reactive. Organolithium reagents such as butyllithium are widely commercially available. Due to their highly reactive nature, they must be handled under a protective atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon as they will catch fire in air.

The main part of the festival takes place between the train station Biel and the Nidaugasse. There are over 100 stalls every year, which sell different things. The shops in Biel usually do their sales in this week, because many people are in the streets during the festival. A stage is set up in the front of the Apollo Cinema. Bands and singers present their music on this stage. The Braderie is known for a lot of famous Swiss stars, for example, Stress, DJ Antoine and Pegasus.
The Braderie began in 1936. Since 1930 and the big economic crisis, the people of Biel were searching for a way to improve the economy of Biel. The festival was started by Miggi Tièche and Carlo Schneeberger. The first Braderie was a big success. Originally known simply as a solution for the crisis, the Braderie began to be a part of Biel's calendar. There were three Braderies between 1937 and 1939. During World War II, they had to stop the Braderie. The break ended only in 1947, and then the Braderie started again, and it was known as "Bieler Sommerfest" (Biel Summer Celebration). Because of the long history from the Braderie, it is common today for most of the stores in Biel to make their sales during the Braderie.

He became the Governor of Oahu and Maui. The couple had no children. She was an accomplished musician. "Aloha ʻOe" is her best known composition. 
In 1891, Liliʻuokalani became Queen of Hawaii when her brother, the king, died. In 1893, she wanted a new constitution. This caused the American minister in Hawaii great concern. American soldiers took over the ʻIolani Palace and other government buildings. In 1894, they removed Queen Liliʻuokalani as queen. The United States set up a provisional government. It became the Republic of Hawaii. 
The Hawaiian people were on the side of their Queen. President Grover Cleveland offered to return the throne if she granted amnesty to all involved in the takeover of her kingdom. She refused, but then changed her mind and agreed. She was denied her reinstatement by the Provisional Government. On July 4, 1894, the Republic of Hawaii began.

Dutch Golden Age painting

There was a period in the 17th century, where Dutch trade, science and art were among the most advanced in Europe. The period is known as the Dutch Golden Age. In general, this period started in the second half of the Eighty Years' War. After the war, there was the Dutch Republic which was the most propsperous nation in Europe. The historical period of the time was called Baroque. Many of the paintings of this period show the scenes more pretty than they really were. This is called 'idealisation'. The Dutch paintings of the time often lack this feature. Artists of the movement include Peter Paul Rubens, Johannes Vermeer, Bartholomeus van der Helst, and Jacob van Loo.
There were relatively few paintings with religious themes during this period. The reason for this was that most Dutch were Calvinist. Calvinism forbade religious painting in churches. Even though such subjects were acceptable in private homes, they were not very popular. The other traditional classes of history and portrait painting were present, but the period is more notable for a huge variety of other genres, sub-divided into numerous specialized categories, such as scenes of peasant life, landscapes, townscapes, landscapes with animals, maritime paintings, flower paintings and still lifes of various types. The development of many of these types of painting was decisively influenced by 17th-century Dutch artists. 
There was a theory in painting, that some types of painting were more prestigious than others. This theory is known as "hierarchy of genres". Because history painting was at the top of the list, many painters wanted to produce historical paintings. The problem with this was that historical paintings were the most difficult to sell. To be able to live from their painting, many painters were forced to produce portraits or genre scenes, which sold much more easily. The hierarchy was as follows:
The Dutch concentrated heavily on the "lower" categories, but by no means rejected the concept of the hierarchy. Most paintings were relatively small – the only common type of really large paintings were group portraits. Painting directly onto walls hardly existed; when a wall-space in a public building needed decorating fitted framed canvas was normally used. For the extra precision possible on a hard surface many painters continued to use wooden panels, some time after the rest of Western Europe had abandoned them; some used copper plates, usually recycling plates from printmaking. In turn the number of surviving Golden Age paintings was reduced by them being overpainted with new works by artists throughout the 18th and 19th century – poor ones were usually cheaper than a new canvas, stretcher and frame. There was very little Dutch sculpture during the period; it is mostly found in tomb monuments and attached to public buildings, and small sculptures for houses are a noticeable gap, their place taken by silverware and ceramics. Painted delftware tiles were very cheap and common, if rarely of really high quality, but silver, especially in the auricular style, led Europe. With this exception, the best artistic efforts were concentrated on painting and printmaking.

Starving Time

The Starving Time at Jamestown in Virginia Colony was a period of starvation during the winter of 1609–1610. During this time, all but 60 of the 400 colonists died. Lack of rain and access to water had crippled the agricultural production during the summer. Also, the water that the colonists drank was brackish and only drinkable half the year. Several other factors led to a 
According to historical accounts, the colonists ate dogs, snakes, cats, rats, horses, books and shoe leather through the winter. There is forensic evidence of at least one instance of cannibalism. The remains of a teenage girl ( 1595–1609), named "Jane" by researchers, showed signs of being butchered (cut up for eating). Examination of Jane's shin bone indicates she was probably 14 years old at the time of her death. Based on studies of the isotopes in a tooth, she was probably from southern England. She was possibly the daughter of a gentleman or a maid in a gentleman's home because she had consumed generous amounts of protein (meat). Jane likely arrived in Virginia in August 1609. 
It is almost certain Jane was removed from her grave before being butchered and eaten. She was not murdered. In 1625, George Percy, president of Jamestown during the starvation period, wrote that the hunger was so intense “thatt notheinge was Spared to mainteyne Lyfe and to doe those things which seame incredible, as to digge upp deade corpes outt of graves and to eate them." Five other accounts refer to cannibalism during the bitter winter.
Only 10 percent of Jane's remains have been recovered by researchers. The remains were found about 2.5 feet (0.8 m) down in a trash pit in the cellar of a building built in 1608 inside the James Fort site. Historical accounts indicate cannibalism was widespread at Jamestown during the winter. Modern historians were reluctant to credit these accounts without other evidence. Jane however is the first forensic evidence that confirms the existence of the practice during that winter.

Armin Meiwes (born 1 December 1961) is a German man who is known for being a cannibal. Meiwes, a 41-year-old bisexual computer technician, placed an advertisement online for a well-built male he could kill and eat. Forty-three year old Bernd-Jurgen Brandes answered the ad in March 2001. Meiwes took Brandes to his home in Rotenberg. Brandes had sex with Meiwes, then asked Meiwes to cut off his penis. Meiwes did so, then fried the penis. The two ate it. Meiwes then killed Brandes with Brandes's consent by stabbing him repeatedly in the neck. He cut the body in pieces and froze the pieces for later consumption. Meiwes was arrested in December 2002. He had consumed about 20 kg of Brandes' body. Cannibalism was not illegal in Germany in 2001 when Meiwes killed and ate Brandes. Meiwes was convicted of killing by request and defiling a corpse. He received a sentence of 8.5 years. The Meiwes case was the first cannibalism case in Germany.

Tiny Wings

Tiny Wings is an iOS game developed by German game developer Andreas Illiger, released on February 18, 2011.
In "Tiny Wings", the player takes control of a bird whose wings are too small to fly. The goal of the game is to use hills in order to gain speed as long as possible. This is done by tapping and holding the screen in order to make the bird dive. The game play mainly revolves around timing your taps so that the bird goes down hills and flies up them. The game's day trip version is separated into several islands, which have different layouts and change every 24 hours. The game features special goals that allow players to upgrade their nest, which adds a score multiplier usually X2. These challenges go around reaching specific islands or performing certain tricks a number of times in one game. The game's visuals change daily along with the islands' layouts.
Flight School, a new mode that came out in version 2.0, is similar to normal gameplay, but it instead features a race between 4 young birds (which are siblings). The player can choose to control one of the birds while the rest of the birds are controlled by the CPU. The birds are listed here with their colors and are ranked according to their typical finishing positions The player can also change the birds' names.
The goal in flight school is to reach mama bird first.
If you are faster than the other birds you'll get the fattest fish. To unlock the next island players must finish in 3rd, 2nd, or 1st place.
In 3rd place you'll get a small Blue fish, in 2nd place a medium-sized Cyan fish, and in 1st place you'll get the fattest Yellow fish. When a set of islands is completed by a bird, its nest is upgraded. This mode includes 2 new features: rubber flowers birds can bounce on, and water holes that slow down the birds.
The mama bird is dark green and is from the day trip mode.
Not all levels are in daytime levels. Levels 1-3 2-3 3-4 are all nighttime levels. They have a different song then the daytime levels.
Tiny Wings was first released with one mode (called Day Trip after version 2). Version 2 was released as an update in July 12, 2012, and added a new mode, Flight School with of a race between 4 birds, one of which is used by the player. The levels in Flight School are divided into islands, with 5 tracks in each. There are 3 island tracks. They are Clown islands, Koi islands, and Orga islands. Also there will be more island tracks coming soon as updates. Flight School includes 2 new features on the islands. The July 2012 update also gives the ability to gift app.
The HD version (released at the same time as version 2) includes Hill Party as the 3rd chapter.

In 1853, he wrote his first novel, "Hatchie, the Guardian Slave". Adams taught in the Boston public schools for many years. While teaching, he discovered what kinds of books boys liked best. In 1855, he wrote The Boat Club series for boys. This series was a great success. He wrote many more boys' series. 
In 1865, he stopped teaching. He wanted to devote all his time to writing. He became editor of the children's magazines "The Student and Schoolmate", "Our Little Ones", and "". He served in the Massachusetts legislature for one year. Adams died at his home in Dorchester, Massachusetts in 1897.
Children's writer Louisa May Alcott did not like his books. She did not like the slang and settings such as saloons. Librarians did not like Adams's books either. They threw them away. They also threw away the books of other boys' writers. Adams kept writing boys' books though. He got good reviews from the critics. His books sold well. They were reprinted many times.

In computer programming with object-oriented programming languages, duck typing is a way to write computer code. It doesn't demand that you know what types you are writing about. If it does what you thought it would do, it is good enough. The reason this is called "duck typing" is the duck test.

Sorry about this. I dopily put up Menhir yesterday, forgetting we already had Standing stone [=synonym]. So I've shifted the Menhir content to Standing stone, and substituted a redirect (which should have been there in the first place). () 11:38, 14 April 2013 (UTC)

The article on the game Minecraft has some "troll" comments. The ones I've noticed so far were in the History branch (wrong date, disinformation, foul langage (quoting: "shitty graphics")), a "your mum" joke in the NPC branch and the "Adventurer" game mode. Please look into this. I'm a person who can take a joke, but since simple wikipedia is made partially for children, such comments do NOT belong here 
Please userfy to the userspace of the user who has been working on it. That is not the right place for working on an article. Thanks. -- () 07:53, 25 April 2013 (UTC)

Hi, I think the Simple English Wikipedia needs to start a massive bot work, which will place the original English Wikipedia language link on top of every "in other languages" wiki page here. It's absurd that people using this wikipedia will have to struggle to find its sister site. Any thought/suggestions about the matter?

I think it is time to put some brakes on user:24.218.110.195, but better done by someone other than me. He never listens to anything said, and is very aggressive. His record on English wiki suggests he will not change his behaviour. He has smothered the geology period pages with templates, and on such as Ediacaran the open template completely dominates the page. If the templates were all a) set closed, and b) at the bottom of the page, they would at least be tolerable. () 13:28, 17 June 2013 (UTC)

I notice this user is continually removing material from his talk page, material which was placed there by others. It goes way beyond normal tidying-up. Do we have an opinion about this?

Per the thread above, it has become more common that people are not using to report vandalism. The incident above there was a dozen or so vandal changes and not reported. Even recently on this page I note that one of our regular editors had no idea about the page. I propose this change (I've undone it just now).

Naturally I'm concerned at how we handle persistent and obsessive changes to stable pages by unregistered users. This type of disruptive editing has been difficult to handle. It includes lack of prior discussion, refusal to accept consensus, lack of common sense, unwillingness to listen, and so on. I know this has been a problem on English wiki also, but they make more use of semi-protection and range blocks. 
As we know, semi-protection keeps unregistered users off the page, whilst they may still make suggestions on talk pages; range blocks ban disruptive users from particular topics or sections of the wiki. 
We have had several obsessive editors here who evidently think "Simple should have everything that English wiki has" combined with a more or less complete inability to simplify the language. To counter this, I'm hoping for a bit of a shift in the direction suggested... () 07:29, 26 June 2013 (UTC)

As predicted, user has returned, making dozens of changes, almost none of which improve the pages from the perspective of our readers. Almost all the changes are extra details brought over from English wiki, including an obsession with exact numbers (20.03 or 2.886 million years is quite silly. Instead 20 and 2.9 would be sufficiently accurate for almost all purposes). Part of this is ignorance: he doesn't know that scientists only use precise figures when they make a practical difference. But really, the reason the figures are exact is because he finds them on English wiki. He continues to work as though we are English wiki, and ignores the special needs of out audience. Reference sections put in repeat information already on the page, and so on.
These changes often take a lot of time to assess, because amongst them might be one or two useful changes. However, that time is my time, and there is a limit to how much time I can give to such a pointless and soul-destroying activity. I mentioned before how he never signed on to a full belief in our remit, and instead he has been trying to make our pages look like English wiki. He needs to be restrained, because his work runs counter to our general intentions. What is nore, he knows this, and has been editing in such a way as to be difficult to characterise as simple vandalism. Nevertheless, it is truly disruptive. () 15:23, 7 July 2013 (UTC)

Recently some confusion has cropped up over how long we should be leaving reports intact on VIP - both those which are completed and those which have had additional comments assigned to them. Way back in the mists of time it was the case that if you blocked someone you'd revert the report, and if there was a comment it would normally be removed after a few hours. Later - but still with a fair bit of cloud hanging around - I'm sure we agreed that all reports (whether that be a block or 'other action) should have a comment attached to them and remain in place for 'a fixed time period' - which I believe was 24 hours. More recently, we seem to have entered a state of limbo where there is confusion as to what the appropriate course of action is - some revert, some keep. Personally, I don't have an opinion either way, although I believe that a clarification would be useful for all users, both those who report, those who deal with and those (like me) who clerk. 12:58, 12 July 2013 (UTC)

David Unaipon

David Unaipon (born David Ngunaitponi; 28 September 1872 – 7 February 1967) was an indigenous Australian preacher, inventor, writer and activist. He was a member of the Ngarrindjeri nation. He was born at Point McLeay, a Lutheran mission located on the mouth of the Murray River southeast of Adelaide. He preached widely throughout South Australia, often travelling on foot. He became the first Aboriginal Australian to publish a written work in English.
Unaipon's portrait is featured on the Australian $50 bank note in commemoration.
David Unaipon was born on 28 September 1872, at the Point McLeay mission in the Coorong region of South Australia. His father was James Ngunaitponi and his mother's name was probably Nymbulda. James and Nymbulda had nine children, and David was the fourth. He began his education at the age of seven at the Point McLeay Mission School and quickly became known for his intelligence. Unaipon left school at 13 to work as a servant for C. B. Young in Adelaide, where Young encouraged Unaipon's interest in literature, philosophy, science and music. In 1890, he returned to Point Mcleay, where he worked as an apprentice bootmaker. He was also chosen as the mission's organist. In the late 1890s, he travelled again to Adelaide to find work. He discovered, however, that his skin colour stopped him getting work in bootmaking and instead took a job as a bootmaker's storeman.
After returning to Point McLeay, Unaipon worked as a book-keeper in the local store. On 4 January 1902, he married Katherine Carter (née Sumner), a Ngarrindjeri woman of the Tangane tribe.
Unaipon took out provisional patents for 19 inventions, but he could not afford to get any of his inventions fully patented. His most successful invention was a shearing machine (provisional patent 15 624) that converted curvilineal motions into the straight-line movement that is the basis of modern mechanical shears. Unaipon never received any money from it, however. Apart from a newspaper report in 1910 acknowledging him as the inventor, he received no credit.
Unaipon became well-known as an inventor, and a recognised authority on ballistics. Other inventions of his included a centrifugal motor, a multi-radial wheel and a mechanical propulsion tool. He drew many of his ideas for mechanical inventions, including a helicopter design based on the principle of the boomerang. He also spent a large amount of time trying to achieve perpetual motion.
Unaipon was a Christian for all of his life. After he married, he worked for the Aborigines' Friends' Association as a "deputationer", in which he travelled widely throughout South Australia preaching for the Point McLeay Mission. He modelled his teachings on the Bible-based style of the missionaries who had taught him. He believed that the traditional Aboriginal and Christian spiritualities were basically the same.
His travels brought him into contact with many people sympathetic with the cause of Aboriginal rights. Although Unaipon was much in demand as a public speaker, he was also often refused accommodation and hospitality due to his race. He gradually became well-known in public life as a spokesman for Aboriginal Australians. Between 1928 and 1929, he helped as a researcher and witness for the Bleakley Inquiry into Aboriginal welfare. In 1934, he lobbied the federal government to take over responsibility for Aborigines from its constituent states.
Unaipon retired from preaching in 1959 but continued working on his inventions into the 1960s.
Unaipon was the first Australian Aboriginal to publish a written work in English. He wrote many articles in newspapers and magazines, including "The Daily Telegraph", in which he retold traditional Dreaming stories and argued for the rights of Aboriginal people. Some of Unaipon's traditional stories were published in book in 1930, called "Myths and Legends of the Australian Aboriginals". It was published under the name of anthropologist William Ramsay Smith. They were republished in their original form in 2006, under the author's name, as "Legendary Tales of the Australian Aborigines".
Unaipon was obsessed with correct English. When speaking, he tended to use classical English rather than using the common style of his time. His written language followed the style of John Milton and John Bunyan.
Unaipon returned to his Point Mcleay in his old age. He worked more on his inventions and tried to find the secret of perpetual motion. He died in the Tailem Bend Hospital on 7 February 1967, and was buried in the Raukkan (formerly Point McLeay) Mission Cemetery. David was the last full-blooded member of the Waruwaldi tribe.
Several things are named after him in commemoration:

Governor of Idaho

The Governor of Idaho is the head of the executive branch of Idaho's government. He is also the commander-in-chief of the state's militia. The job of the governor is to see that the state laws are obeyed. The governor has the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Idaho Legislature.
Idaho Territory had 16 territorial governors chosed by the President of the United States from 1863 until it became a state in 1890. Four of these never took office. They resigned before they got to Idaho.
Thirty people have been Governor of Idaho since it became a state in 1890. Two of these—C. A. Bottolfsen and Cecil D. Andrus—served non-consecutive terms. The state's first governor was George Laird Shoup. He had the shortest term - three months. Cecil D. Andrus served as governor the longest at 14 years. Four governors resigned. None have died while in office. There have been 20 Republican and 12 Democratic governors. The current governor is C. L. "Butch" Otter. He took office on January 1, 2007. His current term will expire in January 2015.
Idaho Territory was created from Dakota Territory, Nebraska Territory, and Washington Territory on March 4, 1863. At first, the territory included all of modern-day Idaho and Montana, and most of Wyoming. On May 26, 1864, Montana Territory was separated from Idaho Territory, and most of the Wyoming portion was became part of Dakota Territory. The area east of the 111th meridian became part of the new Wyoming Territory on July 25, 1868. This gave Idaho Territory its final borders.
Because of the long distance between Washington, D.C. and Boise, there was often a long time between a governor being chosen and his arrival in the territory. 
Idaho became a state on July 3, 1890. Since then, the state has had 30 governors. Two of these served non-consecutive terms. The terms for governor and lieutenant governor are four years. It starts on the first Monday in the January after the election. Before 1946, the offices were elected to terms of two years. If there is no governor or the governor is out of state or cannot do his duties, the lieutenant governor acts as governor. If neither the governor and lieutenant governor can do their duties, the President "pro tempore" of the Idaho Senate is next in line. After that person, the Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives would act as governor. There is no limit to the number of terms a governor may serve.
Sixteen of Idaho's governors have served higher federal offices or as governors of other states. Nine have served in the U.S. Senate, and three have served in the U.S. House. Two governors have been U.S. Secretaries of the Interior. One served as ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. Six governors (marked with *) resigned to take a new office.
Also, two people who were appointed governor of Idaho Territory but never took office held other high offices. Gilman Marston was a representative and senator from New Hampshire. John Philo Hoyt was Governor of Arizona Territory.
All representatives and senators listed represented Idaho except where noted.
, five former governors were alive. The most recent death of a former governor was that of Robert E. Smylie (1955–1967). He died at age 89 on July 17, 2004.

Conrad Hilton

Conrad Nicholson Hilton (December 25, 1887 – January 3, 1979) was an American businessman. He founded the Hilton Hotels chain.
Hilton was born in San Antonio, New Mexico. His father, Augustus Halvorsen "Gus" Hilton, was an immigrant from Norway. His mother, Mary Genevieve (née Laufersweiler), was an American of German descent. Hilton had eight siblings.
Hilton attended school in New Mexico. He was a member of the international fraternity Tau Kappa Epsilon. In his early twenties, Hilton was a Republican representative in the first New Mexico Legislature, when the state was new. He was in the U.S. Army for two years during World War I.
When he was a boy, Hilton worked at his father's general store in Socorro County, New Mexico. Later he was a representative in New Mexico's first state legislature.
Hilton went to Texas to buy a bank. Instead, in 1919, he bought the 40-room Mobley Hotel in Cisco, Texas. The hotel did very good business. The dining room was changed into more rooms to make room for more guests.
Hilton later bought and built hotels all over Texas. His hotels included the Dallas Hilton (opened in 1925), the Abilene Hilton (opened in 1927), the Waco Hilton in 1928, and the El Paso Hilton in 1930. The first hotel he built outside of Texas was in 1939 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. That hotel became Hotel Andaluz. During the Great Depression, Hilton almost had to go into bankruptcy. He lost several of his hotels. He continued to manage hotels, even when he didn't own them. He eventually got his hotels back.
During the next decade he opened hotels in California, Chicago, and New York. The hotels included the Stevens Hotel in Chicago (then the world's largest hotel), and the famous Waldorf-Astoria in New York. In 1946, he started the Hilton Hotels Corporation. In 1948, he started the Hilton International Company.
In the 1950s and 1960s, Hilton expanded his business worldwide. He created the first international hotel chain. Hilton eventually owned 188 hotels in thirty-eight cities in the United States. His hotels included the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D. C., the Palmer House in Chicago, the Plaza Hotel and Waldorf-Astoria in New York City, and fifty-four hotels outside the United States. He later bought the Carte Blanche Credit Company, part of the American Crystal Sugar Company, and other businesses.
Hilton received honorary degrees from the University of Detroit (1953), DePaul University (1954), Barat College (1955), Adelphi College (1957), Sophia University, Tokyo (1963), and the University of Albuquerque (1975). His autobiography, "Be My Guest", was published in 1957. In 1966, Hilton was elected chairman of the board. His son Barron took over as president.
In 1925, Hilton married Mary Adelaide Barron. They had three children: Conrad Nicholson "Nicky" Hilton, Jr., William Barron Hilton, and Eric Michael Hilton. They divorced in 1934.
In 1942, Hilton married actress Zsa Zsa Gabor. They had one child: Constance Francesca Hilton. They divorced in 1946.
In 1976, Hilton married Mary Frances Kelly. Their marriage lasted until his death in 1979.
In 1979, Hilton died of natural causes at the age of 91. He is buried at Calvary Hill Cemetery in Dallas, Texas.
Conrad Hilton is the great grandfather of Paris Hilton and Nicky Hilton.

Abu Dhabi (, "ʼAbū Ẓaby") is one of the emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates. It is the largest of the seven. The capital city of UAE, Abu Dhabi, is in this emirate. Al Ain is Abu Dhabi's second largest urban area with a population of 348,000 (as of the 2003 census estimate).

Dubai (emirate)

Dubai or you can also call it Dubayy () is one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates. The main city of the emirate is Dubai. The city is sometimes called "Dubai City" to prevent it from being confused with the emirate.
Dubai is the second largest emirate in the UAE after Abu Dhabi. The emirate is on the Persian Gulf, southwest of Sharjah and northeast of Abu Dhabi. The town of Hatta is an exclave of the emirate of Dubai. It borders nearby Oman.
Dubai's economy is different from other members of the UAE because income from oil is only 6% of its gross domestic product. Most of the emirate's income is from
On 8 January 1820, the sheikh of Dubai was one of the people who signed the British sponsored "General Treaty of Peace" (the General Maritime Treaty).
In 1833, the Al Maktoum dynasty of the Bani Yas tribe settled at Dubai creek. From that point on, Dubai was a newly independent emirate. It was always struggling with the emirate of Abu Dhabi. An attempt by the Qawasim pirates to take over Dubai was stopped. In 1835, Dubai and the rest of the Trucial States signed a maritime truce with Britain and a "Perpetual Maritime Truce" about twenty years later. Dubai came under the protection of the United Kingdom (keeping out the Ottoman Turks) by the Exclusive Agreement of 1892. Like four of its neighbours, Abu Dhabi, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm al-Qaiwain, its being on the way to India made it an important place.
In March 1892, the Trucial States (or Trucial Oman) were created. 
After the Gulf Rupee lost value in 1966, Dubai joined the newly independent state of Qatar to set up a new monetary unit, the Qatar/Dubai riyal. Oil was discovered 120 kilometres off the coast of Dubai, after which the town granted oil concessions. 
On 2 December 1971 Dubai formed the United Arab Emirates, together with Abu Dhabi and five other emirates. This was done after former protector Britain left the Persian Gulf in 1971. In 1973, Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a single, uniform currency: the UAE dirham.
Oil supply in Dubai is less than 1/20th as much as the emirate of Abu Dhabi, and oil money is now only a small part of the city's total money. Dubai and its twin across the Dubai creek, Deira (independent at that time), became important ports of call for Western manufacturers. Most of the new city's banking and financial centers were in this area. Dubai kept its importance as a trade route through the 1970s and 1980s. The city of Dubai has a free trade in gold and till the 1990s was the center of a "brisk smuggling trade" of gold ingots to India, where gold import was restricted. 
Today, Dubai is an important place for tourists and port (Jebel Ali, built in the 1970s, has the biggest man-made harbour in the world), but also increasingly becoming a center for service industries such as IT and finance, with the new Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). Transport links are helped by its rapidly-expanding Emirates Airline, made by the government in 1985 and still state-owned. The airline is based at Dubai International Airport and carries over 12 million passengers every year.
The government has set up industry-specific free zones throughout the city. Dubai Internet City, now combined with Dubai Media City as part of TECOM (Dubai Technology, Electronic Commerce and Media Free Zone Authority) is one such enclave whose members include IT firms such as EMC Corporation, Oracle, Microsoft, and IBM, and media organisations such as MBC, CNN, Reuters, ARY and AP. Dubai Marina is a master plan development by EMAAR which will be the worlds largest marina when complete. Dubai Knowledge Village (KV) is an education and training hub is also set up to complement the Free Zone’s other two clusters, Dubai Internet city and Dubai Media City, by providing the facilities to train the clusters' future knowledge 
workers.
Dubai had a property boom when they announced freehold property resulting in large capital investments. With the global recession property prices have fallen dramatically.

Same-sex marriage in the United States

Same-sex marriage is recognized in all of the United States. As of May 2014, same-sex marriage was legal in 19 states: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. It was also legal in Washington, D.C.. On June 26, 2015, the United States Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage is legal in all states, because of the 14th Amendment.
The movement to give marriage rights and benefits to homosexual couples in the United States began in the 1970s. It grew in United States politics around 1993 when the Supreme Court of Hawaii declared the prohibition in that state to be unconstitutional. It was not until around the 21st century that public support for same-sex marriage began growing. On May 9, 2012, Barack Obama was the first President to declare public support for the legalization of same-sex marriage. On June 26, 2015 the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional (see United States v. Windsor). That section prevented the federal government from recognizing marriages other than marriages between one man and one woman.

Saab JAS 39 Gripen

The Saab JAS 39 Gripen is a fourth-generation fighter aircraft.
It was created by Saab, a Swedish aerospace company, for use in the Swedish Air Force. The decision for a new aircraft system was made by the Minister of Defence, Torsten Gustafsson. It was approved by Parliament in 1982.
The Gripen is one of the first multi-role combat aircraft that can be used for fighter, attack and reconnaissance missions as well as switching between them during flight, hence the name of the JAS 39. ‘J’ stands for the initial of the Swedish language word for "Hunting", meaning attack against air targets, "attack" to attack ground and sea targets, and ‘S’ stands for the Swedish word for "reconnaissance", to take photos and films. The name "Gripen" is the result of a contest held in the early 1980s, and means ‘griffin’.
The Gripen aircraft fighter system has for years been the backbone in the Swedish air force. Recently the Swedish government decided to acquire the latest version of the system, Gripen E, and Saab signed an agreement with the Swedish Defence Material Administration about development and modification of Gripen E.

She appears on talk shows. She has had her own hour-long radio talk show. In March 2011, Sylvia had a heart attack while in the Hawaiian Islands. 
Browne has been the subject of frequent criticism for making psychic predictions that were later proven false. These have included several predictions related to missing persons, most notably Shawn Hornbeck and Amanda Berry.
She was born in Kansas City, Missouri. Browne was Jewish.<ref name="CNN0103/06"></ref> Browne made many wrong predictions. She predicted that President Barack Obama would not be re-elected as President of the United States. (In September, she made a different prediction that Obama would be re-elected.)

<doc id="397056" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=397056" title="Creatine">
Creatine

Creatine is a combination of three non-essential amino acids, methionine, arginine and glycine. Creatine is used for the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the human body's energy. Creatine is already in the body as a natural substance. The body changes it to phosphocreatine. It is then stored as energy in the muscles. The energy systems of the body are: aerobic, lactate and phosphocreatine. Creatine is mainly used in the lactate system and the phosphocreatine system because these two need more energy. They also take a part of the energy from the production or the absorption of creatine.
Creatine has two principals effects: bodybuilding (or increase of muscle) and increasing the amount of protein synthesis. The body gain is caused by the water retention of cells that store creatine. For protein synthesis, it is not entirely known, but creatine can help with the recovery of muscle. During the recovery time, the creatine gives extra energy so the cells of the muscle can speed up the protein absorption of the cells.
The creatine is used by all the human body because it travels by the blood stream. But the heart and the muscles will be the main parts that use the creatine cells. Most of the creatine production will be stored in the skeletal muscle because they need a lot of energy and they need it quickly. The body produces about two grams of creatine per day. Basically, only 90 to 95 percent of the human creatine production will travel in the blood stream. The five to ten percent that is not used is lost.

LEED

Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a certification program for the design, construction and operation of high performance green buildings since 2002. This mark of excellence is known across the world and there are four levels of excellence. There are 100 possible base points distributed across five major credit categories: Sustainable Sites, Water Efficiency, Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, Indoor Environmental Quality, plus an additional six points for Innovation in Design and an additional four points for Regional Priority. Buildings can qualify for four levels of certification.
LEED is not a standard but an evaluation grid. LEED is a way to think up and realise art projects in a durable way. LEED only applies to buildings and not to products. It is not a prize but a certification that is delivered by the CaGBC (Canada Green Building Consil). They are the ones who will make sure that all the points are well applied and respected.
So, LEED is a grid that helps us obtain a maximum gain of money, health conditions and restrictions on earth pollution. If there is a house to build in Canada, we must do the excavation and that earth is usually brought to a landfill. But, if you want to stay within LEED standards, that earth must be left on the site. Also, if you have to demolish a building, you must use and demonstrate that you recycled all materials in the construction. Also, that you used the maximum quantity of material possible from the old building to the one being built.
Certified: 40–49 points,
Silver: 50–59 points,
Gold: 60–79 points,
Platinum: 80 points and above 
There are several benefits but there are also disadvantages. The biggest disadvantage is the amount of money it takes to start a project. At first, it may seem expensive. If you look at it as a long term investment, though, a LEED project can save a good amount of money.
A 2008 white paper by the Leonardo Academy compared LEED-EB buildings to data from BOMA's Experience Exchange Report in 2007. This showed that LEED-EB certified buildings had better operating cost savings, in 63% of the buildings surveyed. It ranged from $4.94 to $15.59 per square foot of floor space, with an average valuation of $6.68 and a median valuation of $6.07.

Synchronized swimming

Synchronized swimming is a sport that is practiced in the water. It is a routine performed with music, like dancing. This sport is demanding because it needs cardio and muscular power. It also requires a good capacity of location in three dimensions in the water while the athletes are performing.
Synchronized swimming became an Olympic sport in 1884, in Los Angeles, with solo and duo routines. In Montreal, the first competition took place in 1924. Also, in 2000, they included team routines at Sydney’s Olympics. Synchronized swimming and rhythmic gymnastics are the only sports exclusively practiced by women at the Olympics.
In Quebec, the provincial competitions are organised by Synchro Quebec. There are three different events to accomplish at the competition. First, the swimmer does a flexibility test that will count for 30% of the results. Secondly, the swimmer presents two to four figures in front of judges, depending on the level. Finally, all the athletes present their routine in front of the judges; there are solo, duo, combo and team routines. Figure and routine will count for 70% of results.
In the USA there are many levels of competition including State, Regional, Zone, Age Group National, and US Junior and Senior Opens. In each competition, athletes are judged on their level and age. There are four levels that are determined by skill level: novice (beginners), intermediate, age group (advanced), and masters (over the age of 20). Within these levels, are groups according to age: 8 and under, 9-10, 11-12, 13-15, 16-17, and 18-19. During a competition, there can be two to three events to accomplish. During the figure test, a swimmer needs to perform four figures that vary from competition to competition and level to level in front of a panel of judges. The four judges will each give a score from 1-10. The scores from each panel are averaged and added up. The results from the figure test are 50% of the team's final routine score. The next event is routines, where the performer presents a routine to the judges. There are four different types, solo (one swimmer), duet (two swimmers), trio (three swimmers) and team (four to eight swimmers). Because the more people in a team routine, the harder it is to synchronize, a point will be added for each swimmer. Each routine has a certain length and certain elements that need to be included according to age and skill level. Occasionally, a large competition will have a flexibility test. For each team member who passes the test, a point will be added to the routine's final score.
To practice synchronized swimming, athletes need a swimsuit for training, a black suit for the figure test and a routine suit for each routine competition that fits with the music. For example, if an athlete is swimming a duet and a team routine, two different competition swimsuits will be needed. Also, they will need goggles and bathing cap for trainings. These are not allowed for routine competition, only for the figure test. Only a white or black bathing cap can be worn at the figure test, because the objective is to not recognise athletes. To keep hair up on their head during the routine competition, athletes make a bun that is held by bobby pins and edible gelatin. Girls put on make-up that fits with their swimsuits.
Finally, it is important for synchronized swimming athletes to train. Training can consolidate muscle endurance, cardio endurance and increase flexibility. It allows a better performance during competitions. Trainings are frequent and very demanding. Swimmers need to be at their best in competition because only few points can determine the first and the second place.

In chemistry a cyclic compound is a molecule where some atoms are linked together forming a loop or ring. Most of the time, these molecules are organic. There are also many examples of inorganic molecule forming rings.
Cyclic compounds can be aromatic: in this case they are flat. Benzene is a simple aromatic cyclic compound. When they are not aromatic, rings tend not to be flat to avoid steric effects.
Cyclic compounds are very important. Many drugs are based on them, like aspirin. There are many reactions that can make or break cyclic compounds. One important class of these is pericyclic reactions.

Buford, Georgia

Buford is a city in the U.S. state of Georgia. Most of the city is in Gwinnett County. A small part of it is in Hall County. In the 2010 census, the city had a population of 12,225.
After the American Civil War a railroad was built that travelled from Atlanta, Georgia to Richmond, Virginia. While the railroad was being built two railroad stockholders bought land around the railroad, and began building a town. The town was named after the railroad company's president, Algernon Sidney Buford. The railroad was completed in 1871, and Buford officially became a town on August 24, 1872. The Town of Buford was renamed the City of Buford in 1896.
In the later part of the 1800s and the early part of the 1900s Buford became famous for making leather products, including saddles which were sold through the Sears mail order catalog. Many famous actors during that time period used saddles made by the Bona Allen Company in Buford, including Gene Autry, the case of the television show Bonanza, and Roy Rogers' horse Trigger.
After the Great Depression ended the horses were not used for farming as much and tractors were used instead, which meant that there was less need for leather products, and the companies that made leather in Buford closed.
Buford is in north Georgia. It is in the northern part of Gwinnett county and in the southern part of Hall county. It is part of the Atlanta metropolitan area.

Edward Mooney House

The Edward Mooney House is at 18 Bowery at the corner of Pell Street in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. It is in an area which is today known as Chinatown. The house was built between 1785 and 1789 by rich butcher Edward Mooney on land that was originally part of the Doyer bouwerie (farm) and afterwards belonged to the British Loyalist James Delancey. The land was confiscated by the new American Government after the American Revolution and sold at auction. Mooney would live in the house untul his death in 1800.
The house was built of brick in the Early Federal style. It has three stories plus an attic and full basement. The home was built close to the slaughterhouses, holding pens and tanneries just east of the freshwater Collect Pond.
In 1807, the size of the house was doubled by an addition to the rear. The house would be used as a private residence until the 1820s. Later, it has been a hotel, brothel and Barney Flynn's saloon.
The house was designated a New York City landmark in 1966 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The Edward Mooney House was sold in January 2013 for $5.4 million dollars.

Color depth

In Computer graphics, the term color depth is used to specify the "amount" of color used. Usually it is measured in bits per pixel. One bit can represent two different values. It is known as monochrome or black and white. 16 bit color depth is known as "high color", 24
bits per pixel are known as truecolor. There are also systems with color depths of 30, 36, or 48 bits per pixel. The RGB color model uses 8 bits per pixel, for a total of 24 bits. There may be an extra Alpha channel, with another 8 bits (so a total of 32 bits). Phase Alternating Line, a standard for televisions uses 32 bits per pixel, with a YUV color space.

Hop (networking)

Computer networks route data packets between a source and a destination. In most cases, the source of a packet is not directly attached to the destination, the packet needs to travel through other stations in between the two. Each time a packet travels through a router, or a gateway it takes one hop. To prevent network congestion, the maximum number of hops a packet can take is limited. With IPv4, this count is known as time to live, with IPv6 it is called hop count. Each time the packet takes one hop, the count is . When it reaches zero, the packet is if it has not reached its destination.

Mark Rothko

Mark Rothko (September 25, 1903 - February 25, 1970) was a Latvian-American modern artist. He was born in a part of the Russian Empire that is now in Latvia, but lived in America for most of his life. He was Jewish. He committed suicide in New York City, at the age of 66, by taking an overdose of anti-depressants and slashing his arms with a razor.
His most famous work is known as abstract expressionism or color field painting. In 2012, one of his works sold for $86.9 million.
Rothko's work matured into rectangular fields of color and light. However, between the early period, and the later fields of color, was a long period of transition, marked by two important events in Rothko's life: the onset of World War II and his reading of Friedrich Nietzsche. 
From October 1948, after the death of his mother, Rothko started using symmetrical rectangular blocks of two to three opposing or contrasting, yet complementary, colors. Also, for the next seven years, Rothko painted in oil only on large canvases with vertical formats. Very large-scale designs were used to overwhelm the viewer, or to make the viewer feel "enveloped within" the painting. For some critics, the large size was an attempt to make up for a lack of substance. In retaliation, Rothko stated:
He even suggested that viewers position themselves as little as eighteen inches away from the canvas so that they might experience a sense of intimacy, as well as awe, a transcendence of the individual, and a sense of the unknown.

Ben-Hur (1959 movie)

Ben-Hur is an epic movie of the sword and sandal genre released in 1959. It was directed by William Wyler. It stars Charlton Heston as Ben-Hur and Stephen Boyd as Messala. It is set in Ancient Rome and Ancient Judea. It tells of two men - one a Jewish prince and the other a Roman tribune - whose friendship turns to bitter hatred. The climax of the movie is a 9-minute chariot race and the crucifixion of Jesus. The movie won 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The movie is based on the 1880 novel, "" by Lew Wallace. A silent movie on the same subject was made in 1925.
The story is about Judah Ben-Hur, a Jewish prince and merchant in Jerusalem at the beginning of the 1st century. Judah's childhood friend Messala returns home as an ambitious commanding officer of the Roman legions. The two men realize that they have changed and hold very different views. During a military parade, a tile falls from the roof of Judah's house. It barely misses the Roman governor. Although Messala knows that they are not guilty, he condemns the Ben-Hur family. Without trial, Judah is sent to the Roman galleys for life; his mother and sister are imprisoned and all the family property is confiscated. 
Through good fortune, Judah survives and returns to Jerusalem, where he seeks revenge against his one-time friend and redemption for his family. Running in parallel with Ben-Hur's narrative is the unfolding story of Jesus, who comes from the same region and is a similar age. The two reflect themes of betrayal, conviction and redemption. With the Crucifixion, Ben-Hur recognizes that the Christ stands for a different goal than revenge, and he becomes Christian, turning to supporting the new religion with money which he has inherited, inspired by love and the talk of keys to a greater kingdom than any on earth.

Quattrocento

Quattrocento is the Italian term that means "four hundred" for the years belonging to the fifteenth century. It was one of the most important periods of European art and culture. It started in Italy and it is the first phase of the movement known as Renaissance.
The Quattrocento (1401-1500) began in Florence, promoted by the Medici family. At this time the figure of the artist and creator was imposed at the expense of anonymity. Man was considered the most perfect work of God, in the early renaissance artists.
In this century art painting techniques evolve, getting the "perspective", and in sculpture comes an improvement based on the imitation of classical Greek and Roman art. Even in architecture there was a return to the lines of Roman monuments.
Lorenzo de' Medici encouraged a lot of his countrymen to commission works from Florence's leading artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, and Michelangelo Buonarroti.
The best artists (after the genius of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo Buonarroti, who worked mainly during the Cinquecento) of this period are:
In Literature the Quattrocento is famous mainly because of Niccolò Machiavelli and Ludovico Ariosto. Indeed, the fundamental characteristic of this literary epoch is that it perfected itself in every kind of art, in particular uniting the essentially Italian character of its language with classicism of style. This period lasted until about a few years after 1494 when Charles VIII of France descended into Italy, marking the beginning of Italy's foreign domination and political decadence.
The famous literary men of the Quattrocento had been educated in the culture created in the preceding century. Niccolò Machiavelli was born in 1469, Michelangelo Buonarroti and Ludovico Ariosto in 1474, Jacopo Nardi in 1476, Gian Giorgio Trissino in 1478, Francesco Guicciardini in 1482, Pietro Pomponazzi in 1462, Marcello Adriani Virgilio in 1464 and Baldassare Castiglione in 1468.
The Renaissance music of Quattrocento was centered around Bartolomeo da Bologna. Indeed, after the "Burgundian School" came to an end, Italy became the leading exponent of Renaissance music and continued its innovation with the Venetian and (somewhat more conservative) Roman Schools of composition.

<doc id="397442" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=397442" title="Wartburg Castle">
Wartburg Castle

The Wartburg is a castle on a 1230-foot (410-m) cliff to the southwest of Eisenach, in the state of Thuringia, Germany. In 1999 UNESCO added Wartburg Castle to the World Heritage List as an "Outstanding Monument of the Feudal Period in Central Europe" because of its "Cultural Values of Universal Significance".
The castle's foundation was laid in about 1068 by the Thuringian count of Schauenburg, Louis the Springer. He was a relative of the Counts of Rieneck in Franconia. Together with its larger sister castle Neuenberg in the present-day town of Freyburg, the Wartburg protected the borders of his territories. 
The castle ("Burg" in German) reportedly got its name when its founder first saw the hill where the castle now sits; he is supposed to have said, "Warte, Berg -- du sollst mir eine Burg tragen!" ("Wait, mountain -- you shall bear a castle for me!"). It is a German play on words for mountain ("Berg") and fortress ("Burg").
The Wartburg remained the seat of the Thuringian landgraves until 1440, and around 1207 it became the place of the "Sängerkrieg", or Minstrels' Contest. Later, Richard Wagner wrote the opera Tannhäuser about the contest.
At the age of four, St. Elisabeth of Hungary was sent by her mother to the Wartburg to be raised to become the wife of Ludwig IV of Thuringia. From 1211 to 1228, she lived there and did charitable work. When her husband died in 1227, she moved to Marburg. She died at the age of 24 and later was canonized (made a saint) by the Roman Catholic Church.
From May 1521 until March 1522, Martin Luther stayed at the castle, after Frederick the Wise had him taken there for his safety. This was after Luther's excommunication by Pope Leo X and his refusal to give up his beliefs at the Diet of Worms. During this time, Luther translated the New Testament into German. It was not the first German translation of the Bible but it became the most well known and most used.
From 1540 until his death in 1548, Fritz Erbe, an Anabaptist farmer from Herda, was held as a prisoner in the dungeon of the south tower, because he refused to give up his beliefs. After his death, he was buried in the Wartburg near the chapel of St. Elisabeth.
On 18 October 1817, the first Wartburg festival took place. About 450 students, members of the German Burschenschaften ("fraternities"), celebrated the German victory over Napoleon that happened four years before, condemned conservatism and called for German unity. Scraps of parchment with the titles of conservative books were burned, because the actual books were very expensive. This event and similar gatherings at Wartburg during the Revolutions of 1848 are considered important events in the movement for German unification.
The Castle has been restored many times. From 1952 to 1966, for example, the East German Government restored it to what it looked like in the 16th century.
The Romanesque "Palas" ("Landgrafenhaus" or Great Hall) is the oldest part of the buildings. Besides the chapel, it has the Sängersaal (Hall of the Minstrels) and the Festsaal (the Feast or Festival Hall), both of which have frescoes by Moritz von Schwind.
Part of the palace is the original castle as it was between 1157 and 1170.
The castle gate behind the drawbridge is the only way to access the Castle, and it has remained exactly as it was when it was built.
The Knights' House on the western side of the drawbridge is from the 15th century. It is probably where the servants and guards lived.
There are two towers, the South Tower (made in 1318) and the bergfried (finished in 1859).
For centuries, many people from Germany and from outside Germany have made pilgrimages to the Wartburg. They do this because of its significance in German history and in the development of Christianity. Several places (especially US towns founded by Lutherans) and a local brand of automobile have been named after the Wartburg. Wartburg College in Iowa, USA, is named after the Wartburg because Martin Luther received protection at the castle, and because of the college's Thuringian heritage.
The Wartburg Adult Care Community in Mount Vernon, New York, which serves the elderly, is also named after the castle. Its founder, William Passavant, said that the original site was similar to the site of the Wartburg.

"The Swineherd" has been adapted to various media including ballet and opera.
A poor prince wants to marry the Emperor's daughter. She is proud and rejects his simple gifts of a nightingale and a beautiful rose. He disguises himself as a swineherd and gets a job tending the pigs at the palace. One day, he makes a wonderful rattle that plays every tune in the world. The princess gives him 10 kisses for it. Another day, he makes a magical pot that lets the owner know what everyone in town is cooking. The princess gives him 100 kisses for the pot. The Emperor is disgusted that his daughter would kiss a swineherd for a couple of toys. He casts her out. The prince is disgusted too, and closes his door on her. The princess is left outdoors singing sadly.

Władziu (or Vladziu) Valentino Liberace (May 16, 1919 – February 4, 1987), best known as Liberace, was an American pianist and vocalist of Polish-Italian origin.
Liberace's career lasted four decades. It included concerts, recordings, movies, television and endorsements. During the 1950s–1970s he was the highest-paid entertainer in the world. He lived a life of flamboyant excess both on and off the stage.
The success of Liberace's syndicated television program made him a popular recording artist. From 1947-51, he released 10 albums. By 1954, it jumped to nearly 70. He released several recordings through Columbia Records, including "Liberace by Candlelight". He sold over 400,000 albums by 1954. His most popular single was "Ave Maria", selling over 300,000 copies.
His albums included popular songs at the time, such as "Hello, Dolly!". He also played his versions of classical music for the composed by Chopin and Liszt. Many fans of classical music criticized them (and Liberace's skills as a pianist in general) for being "pure fluff with minimal musicianship". In his life, he received six gold records.
Liberace was born on May 16, 1919 in West Allis, Wisconsin.
During his career, LIberace denied being homosexual. He successfully won lawsuits against "The Daily Mirror" newspaper and "Confidential" magazine, who had reported some of his gay relationships. He was awarded damages and legal fees. Towards the end of his life his chauffeur sued him for "palimony". That lawsuit did not win.
He died of an AIDS-related illness on February 4, 1987 in Palm Springs, California, aged 67.

Singapore strategy

The Singapore strategy was a strategy about defending the British Empire in the Asian Far East, mainly against the Empire of Japan. The strategy involved a number of different plans and stages, developed between 1919 and 1941. The basic idea was to base a fleet of ships in the Far East. This fleet could then be used to stop and defeat a Japanese force heading towards India or Australia. In 1919, Singapore was chosen because of its strategic location at the end of the Strait of Malacca.
The planners thought that a war with Japan would have three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would make its way to Singapore, so that it could relieve or recapture Hong Kong. The fleet could also impose a blockade on the Japanese home islands, which would force the Japanese to accept terms. The planners did not think it was practical to invade Japan. The planners also thought that the Japanese would fight a naval battle. Japan consists of many islands. The planners therefore thought that economic pressure would be enough.
The Singapore strategy was the cornerstone of British Imperial defence policy in the Far East during the 1920s and 1930s. By 1937, according to Captain Stephen Roskill, "the concept of the 'Main Fleet to Singapore' had, perhaps through constant repetition, assumed something of the inviolability of Holy Writ". With the time, many problems became apparent. One of the problems was that implementing the strategy cost a lot of money. Other difficulties were of a political or practical nature. Because of all these problems, the strategy could not be implemented. During the 1930s, the strategy was constantly criticised in Britain and abroad. Australia used the strategy to spend as little money as possible on the defence of the country. The strategy ultimately led to the despatch of Force Z to Singapore and the sinking of the "Prince of Wales" and "Repulse" by Japanese air attack on 10 December 1941. The subsequent ignominious fall of Singapore was described by Winston Churchill as "the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history".

Peregrine White

Peregrine White (16201704) was a child of William and Susanne White and the brother of Resolved White. Peregrine was born in 1620 aboard the ship "Mayflower". He died in what is now known as Marshfield, Massachusetts on July 20, 1704 at the age of 83 years and 8 months. White was the first baby born on the "Mayflower" as it was docked ouside Plymouth Colony.
White's parents came to America to be able to practice their religious beliefs. The name Peregrine name means: "one who journeys to foreign lands", "traveler", or "pilgrim." White's father, William White, died in 1621 and his mother Susanna, married Edward Winslow, another "Mayflower" passenger. The family grew and White had five step-brothers and sisters. One of his step-brothers became Plymouth Colony Governor Josiah Winslow.

Stephen Boyd

Stephen Boyd (4 July 19312 June 1977) was an actor. He was born in Northern Ireland. He appeared in stage productions in the U.S. and Canada before breaking into English movies in 1955. Four years later, he played "Messala" in "Ben-Hur" (1959) opposite Charlton Heston. Gore Vidal, who did uncredited work on the screenplay, wanted to give "Messala" a homosexual slant. He convinced director William Wyler and Boyd that the bitter hatred between the two characters was the result of a gay relationship gone wrong. Heston was furious about this gay angle when he found out about it years later. Boyd won a Golden Globe for his performance in "Ben-Hur".
Boyd was the first to be considered for the role of Marc Antony in "Cleopatra" (1963) opposite Elizabeth Taylor. Production was delayed for months when Taylor fell ill. Boyd dropped out of the production to honor other commitments. He appeared in "The Fall of the Roman Empire" (1964) with Sophia Loren and Christopher Plummer. The role of Antony went to Richard Burton.
Boyd appeared in other spectacles like "Billy Rose's Jumbo" (1962), "Genghis Khan" (1965), and "The Bible" (1966). He starred in the sci-fi adventure "Fantastic Voyage" (1966). His co-star in "Voyage", Raquel Welch, made sexual advances to him. He declined with, "An actress is a little bit more than a woman, but an actor is a little bit less than a man." She concluded from this remark (and later reported) that Boyd was gay. Boyd always had difficulty picking good scripts. His last movies were cheesy exploitation flicks made in Europe. He was married twice for very brief periods of time. He never came out as gay. He died of a heart attack while playing golf in California.

Queen Mary's Peak

Queen Mary's Peak is the summit of the island of Tristan da Cunha, in the South Atlantic Ocean. The top of it is 2,062 metres (6,765 feet) above sea level. It is named after Mary of Teck, the Queen consort of King George V. It is the highest point of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.
The mountain is the peak of the large shield volcano which forms the island. The crater at the top is wide, with a heart-shaped lake. This lake is normally frozen during the winter, and the upper slopes of the volcano are covered in snow.
The only recorded historical eruption occurred in 1961 from a small crater on the north shore of the island. The island community had to be evacuated.
Queen Mary's Peak was used by sailors on the route from Europe to the Indian Ocean and beyond as a navigational aid. In the 17th century the East India Company instructed captains to sail via Tristan.
The first known attempt to go up to the peak was in 1793 by the French naturalist Louis-Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars. He could not get to the top. However, he collected hundreds of plants. Today, Queen Mary's Peak makes a wonderful but steep climbing route. Climbing it can take 5 to 10 hours, depending on the ability of the walker. Visitors are required to use a local guide if they want to go to "The Peak".

Mazu (goddess)

Mazu, also known as Matsu, is a popular Taoist and Chinese Buddhist goddess. She is the goddess and patroness of the sea. She is believed to protect fisherman and sailors. Mazu is widely worshiped in southern China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Zhejiang, Fuijian, Guangdong and Hainan. She is popularly known as Empress of Heaven and Holy Mother Empress of Heaven. Her other popular titles are Holy Mother Empress of the Heavens above, Heavenly Imperial Concubine, Lady Mazu, Heavenly Princess consort and Heavenly Holy Mother.
Mazu was born on March 23, 906. According to legend when she did not cry when she was born, so she was thereafter named Lin Moniang which means "Silent girl" or "silent young female". She had a mysterious ability to predict weather and often she warned others to not make journeys to the sea. She became a very good swimmer and would often rescue people from the sea even in the harshest weather. There are at least 2 versions of her death. One legend tells that Mazu went out into the sea during a storm to try to find her lost father. Hours passed but still she could not find her father and later died of exhaustion. Another legend tells that Mazu climbed a mountain alone and flew into the heavens and became a goddess.
After her death, her family and many other families of sailors and fishermen started to pray for her heroic acts to try to save those at sea. Soon her worship spread quickly to other parts of Asia. Starting from Fuijian, worship of Mazu spread to neighboring coastal provinces of Zhejiang and Guandong, and thence to all coastal areas of mainland China. Later, due to Chinese immigrants, the worship of Mazu further spread to Taiwan, Vietnam, Japan, Ryuku Islands, and parts of Southeast Asia. Many people soon began to build temples dedicated to Mazu all over the world. 
Mazu is usually shown sitting on a throne between two demons known as "Thousand Miles eye" (, Qianli Yan) and "With-the-Wind Ear" ( Shunfeng Er). According to legend, both of them were conquered by Mazu and then both of them fell in love with her. Mazu said she would marry the one that defeats her. Using her martial art skills, Mazu defeats them both and they become her friends. She is usually dressed in a red robe in paintings and murals, but in sculptures she is clothed in jewel-festooned robes of an empress holding a ceremonial tablet or a jeweled staff whilst wearing the easily recognized flat-topped imperial cap with hanging beads at the front and back.

Vulcanization

Vulcanization is a kind of chemical reaction between sulphur, or another agent, and natural rubber. It makes cross-links between the molecular chains in the rubber. The reaction is not reversible.
The purpose of this is to harden the rubber so it does not melt or soften in relatively low temperatures. This hard rubber can keep its shape when it is used in applications where it might be warmed or cooled.

Edinburgh of the Seven Seas

Edinburgh of the Seven Seas is the only settlement of the island of Tristan da Cunha, in Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, an overseas territory of the United Kingdom, in the South Atlantic Ocean. Locally it is always called "The Settlement".
Edinburgh of the Seven Seas is regarded as the most remote permanent settlement on Earth, being from the nearest human settlement, on Saint Helena.
The first permanent settler was Jonathan Lambert, from Salem, Massachusetts, United States, who came to the islands in December 1810. He declared the islands his property and named them the "Islands of Refreshment". Lambert's rule was short-lived, as he died in 1812.
The settlement was founded on the island of Tristan da Cunha in 1816 by a Corporal William Glass (with his South African wife and two children) after the UK annexed Tristan da Cunha. A military garrison was maintained on the islands as a guard against any French attempts to rescue Napoleon, imprisoned on Saint Helena. The military garrison remained until the end of World War II.
It is named after Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, the second son of Queen Victoria, in honour of his visit to the island in 1867, after which the Settlement was officially (but never locally!) known as "Edinburgh of the Seven Seas".
It was damaged in a volcanic eruption near the Settlement in 1961 which forced the entire population to abandon the settlement and move to the UK. The eruption destroyed the settlement's crayfish factory. The following year a Royal Society expedition went to the islands to assess the damage, and reported that the settlement of Edinburgh of the Seven Seas had been only marginally affected. Most families returned in 1963.
After the return of most of the islanders in 1963, the Settlement was rebuilt. The harbour at Edinburgh was named Calshot Harbour, after the place in Hampshire where the islanders temporarily stayed.
Edinburgh of the Seven Seas is the only major settlement of Tristan da Cunha, and contains a small port, the Administrator's residence, and the post office. There is a school, St Mary's School, with five classrooms, a computer room and other facilities.
Edinburgh of the Seven Seas has a mild and humid oceanic climate, with moderate temperatures throughout the year.

Pannotia

Pannotia (or Greater Gondwanaland and Vendian supercontinent) is a Neoproterozoic supercontinent. It may have existed during the Ediacaran period (~600 million years ago), to the end of the Precambrian (about 541 mya). After that, it split into smaller continents. The small ones were Laurentia, Siberia and Baltica, with the main landmass Gondwana south of them. 
About 750 million years ago the older supercontinent Rodinia split apart into three continents. They were earlier forms of Laurasia and Gondwana, and the continental craton of Congo. About 600 milion years ago, they formed Pannotia.
Pannotia was short-lived. The collisions that formed Pannotia were brief collisions, and the continents making up Pannotia already had active rifting. By about 550 million years ago , or only about 50 million years after Pannotia formed, Pannotia separated into four continents. Later the landmasses would recombine to form the most recent supercontinent, Pangaea.

The Sound of Music (movie)

The Sound of Music is a 1965 American musical movie. It was directed by Robert Wise. It stars Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. The movie is based on the Broadway musical "The Sound of Music". The songs were written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. The musical was based on the book "The Story of the Trapp Family Singers" by Maria von Trapp. The movie is about a young woman who leaves an Austrian convent to become a governess to the seven children of a naval officer widower. "The Sound of Music" contains several popular songs, including "Edelweiss", "My Favorite Things", "Climb Ev'ry Mountain", "Do-Re-Mi", "Sixteen Going on Seventeen", and the title song, "The Sound of Music".
"The Sound of Music" was shot on location in Salzburg, Austria; the state of Bavaria in Germany; and at the 20th Century Fox studios in California, USA. The movie won five Academy Awards including Best Picture. It displaced "Gone with the Wind" as the highest-grossing film of all-time. The cast album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected the movie for preservation in the National Film Registry as it was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

James Webb Space Telescope

James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a telescope that will be put into space. It is planned to be launched in 2018. It is a replacement for the Hubble Space Telescope which was launched in 1990. 
The telescope is named after , who was a director at NASA and created the Apollo program that put astronauts on the moon.
It will have a main mirror that is 6.5 meter (21.3 feet) wide. This is 7 times larger than Hubble. It is so large it is made in 18 pieces that fold together after the launch, so that it can fit into a rocket. It will be looking mostly in the infrared but also some in the red part of the visible light (the pictures will be color coded so we can see them). It will be able to see things that the Hubble Space Telescope cannot. Infrared vision can be used to see heat (like some kinds of night vision goggles). So the telescope itself must be kept as cool as possible. It is protected by a large sunshield, the size of a tennis court, to keep it cool and dark. It will also be in orbit far from Earth, to avoid heat from the Earth and moon.
The JWST will be in orbit 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth, about 4 times farther away from us than the moon is. It is also in a special orbit, beyond the moon, at the second Lagrange point (L2), a place of stable gravity. This keeps it in the Earth's shadow most of the time, it doesn't actually go around the Earth, but goes around the sun at the same speed as the Earth.

Lagrange point

A Lagrange point is a special type of place where the gravity is stable. This is used with two objects in space where the smaller object orbits around the bigger one, like the Earth and the Sun, or the Moon and the Earth. 
There are five places where a small object (like a man-made satellite) can orbit, and the effects of gravity from the larger objects and the centripetal forces balance out. (Centripetal force is the push outward that comes from spinning around). So a small satellite can stay in the Lagrange point without ever needing fuel to stay in orbit. 
It is named after the mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange, who wrote a paper on this in 1772 (long before we put satellites into orbit). Dust clouds and asteroids can also stay in these points.
The five places are called L1, L2, L3, L4 and L5. The first three (L1, L2, L3) are called unstable because if a satellite gets a bit out of place, it will fall away from that point, and not come back without using fuel. L4 and L5 are considered stable - if a satellite gets a bit out of place, it will be pulled back into place by the gravity and centripetal forces.
NASA has used the Lagrange points of the Sun-Earth system to put satellites in orbit. The L1 point (between the Earth and the sun) is used for satellites that watch the sun, to look for solar flares. The L2 point (beyond the Earth) is used for space telescopes. That is where the James Webb Space Telescope will go when it is launched in 2018. It is a million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth. 
Because L4 and L5 are stable, they have attracted dust clouds, and at least one asteroid (for the Earth-Sun system - the bigger planets have more asteroids in their L4 and L5 points). These asteroids are called "Trojan asteroids".

Chur or Coire is the capital city of the caton of Graubünden (also called "Grisons"). About 34.000 people live in the city, which is probably the oldest in Switzerland. The city is located on the Rhine. 
The name "chur" derives perhaps from the Celtic "kora" or "koria", meaning "tribe", or from the Latin "curia" 
Archaeological evidence of settlement at the site goes back as far as the Pfyn culture (3900-3500 BC), Various artefacts from the Bronze Age and Iron Age have been found in the city. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Chur was created in the 4th century. It pis probably the first Roman Catholic diocese to be created northn of the Alps.

Chaldean Rite

The Chaldean Rite, or East Syrian Rite is a rite that is practiced by the Church of the East and its modern descendants, the Assyrian Church of the East, the Ancient Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic Church, and the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church. The Chaldean Catholic Church and the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church are in full communion with the Holy See. Thomas the Apostle established Christianity in Mesopotamia, Assyria, and Persia, when he travelled to India. The First Council of Ephesus in 431, said that the ideas and teachings of Nestorius were false. These teachings are commonly known as Nestorianism. The Church of Seleucia-Ctesiphon did not share this opinion, and split from the other churches. The church was very successful, and quickly spread. The conquest of Tamerlane in the 15th century, almost destroyed the church, and reduced itto a few communities. Differences in opinion resulted in the current situation. Two of the four churches are in full communion with the Holy See. All the churches commonly use the Syrian language for their texts.

Chris Christie

Christopher James "Chris" Christie (born September 6, 1962) is an American politician. In 2010, he became the 55th Governor of New Jersey. He was the first Republican to win a statewide election in New Jersey in 12 years. 
Some people thought Christie was a leading candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination in 2016. He announced his presidential campaign on June 30, 2015. After poor polling numbers and not winning the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries, Christie suspended his campaign on February 10, 2016. On July 12, 2016, it was reported that Christie was on Trump's three-person shortlist to be his running mate in the general election. On July 14, 2016, the Trump campaign announced that Governor of Indiana Mike Pence would be Trump's running mate.
Christie was born on September 6, 1962 in Newark, New Jersey. He is of Irish-Scottish-Sicilian descent. He was raised in Livingston, New Jersey. Christie studied at the University of Delaware and at Seton Hall University. 
Christie joined a Cranford, New Jersey, law firm in 1987, rose to become a partner in 1993, and continued practicing until 2002. 
He was elected county legislator in Morris County, serving from 1995 to 1998, during which time he generally pushed for lower taxes and lower spending. By 2002, Christie had campaigned for Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. Bush appointed him as United States Attorney for New Jersey, a position he held from 2002 to 2008. In that position, he fought political corruption and also obtained convictions for sexual slavery, arms trafficking, racketeering by gangs, and other federal crimes.
In January 2009, Christie declared his candidacy for Governor of New Jersey. He won the Republican primary, and defeated incumbent Governor Jon Corzine in the election that November. In 2013, he won re-election as Governor, defeating Democrat Barbara Buono by a margin of over 22%. He was sworn in to a second term as governor on January 21, 2014. 
As governor, Christie has promised not to raise taxes. He has also vowed to lower the state income and business taxes. On September 18, 2013, Christie signed legislation to overhaul the state's business tax incentive programs. 
Christie is a strong supporter of the state granting tax credits to parents who send their children to private and parochial schools.
He also supports the introduction of state-funded vouchers, which parents of students in failing school districts could use to pay the tuition of private schools.
Christie has stated that he believes that the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is too big and is "killing business" with permit delays. In January 2013 Christie vetoed a New Jersey Legislature bill that would have raised the minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.50 per hour. Christie supports gay marriage, but said that he would not pass a bill allowing gay marriage in New Jersey. He also supports the DREAM Act and illegal immigrants.
On November 21, 2013, Christie was elected Chairman of the Republican Governors Association, succeeding Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal.
On June 27, 2015, Christie launched his presidential campaign website. He announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election on June 30, 2015. After poor polling numbers and not winning the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries, Christie suspended his campaign on February 10, 2016. He later endorsed Donald Trump.
Despite having criticized Donald Trump prior to leaving the race, he endorsed Trump on February 26, 2016. On May 9, 2016, Trump named Christie to head up a transition team in the event of a Trump presidency. He soon emerged as a major power with the Trump campaign. It was then announced on July 12, 2016 that Trump had narrowed down his vice presidential shortlist to three candidates, including Christie. Mike Pence eventually became Trump's running mate.
He has been married to Mary Pat Foster since 1986. They have four children.

United Empire Loyalists

United Empire Loyalists were people living in the 13 colonies in what was British North America in the 1770s who did not agree with the American Revolution.
Many residents of the colonies (possibly a majority) either were not in complete agreement with the Revolution and its leaders, or were against it. Some of them actively worked against it, supporting King George III and the British Government. These people became known as "Tories". In many of the colonies, those who openly expressed being against the Revolution and those who joined militias loyal to King George were declared to be outlaws, and their properties taken away by the people favouring the Revolution. 
Some of these people wanted to remain in a place that was still part of the British Empire, so they moved to what is now Canada. In many places there they received a warm welcome and became a valued part of their new home area. Many of them have maintained social groups which are limited to people whose ancestors were some of these people, and they are still called "United Empire Loyalists".

Education in Cuba

Education in Cuba has been a high priority for the government for many years. The University of Havana was founded in 1727. There are also some well-established colleges and universities. For the 1959 revolution, the Castro government nationalized all educational institutions. They created a system operated completely by the government. Their strong ideological content is present. Also the constitution states that educational and cultural policy is based on Marxist ideology.
According to UNESCO, Cuba spends about 10 percent of its budget on education. This is compared with 4 percent in the United Kingdom and 2 percent in the United States.

A morganatic marriage is a marriage between a royal person and a non-royal person, where the husband's titles and privileges do not go to the wife or any children they have. There are not many morganatic marriages any more. A morganatic marriage is sometimes called a left-handed marriage because in the wedding ceremony the groom usually held his bride's right hand with his left hand instead of his right.

K. Kamaraj

Kumarasami Kamaraj (குமாரசாமி காமராஜ்), better known as K. Kamaraj (15 July 1903 – 2 October 1975), was an Indian politician from Tamil Nadu. He was an important figure in Indian politics during the 1960s. He was the chief minister of Tamil Nadu during 1954–1963 and a Member of Parliament during 1952–1954 and 1969–1975.
Kamraj was born on July 15, 1903, in a family of traders at Virudunagar. His real name was Kamakshi Kumaraswamy Nadar but was affectionately shortened to Raja by his mother, Sivakami Ammal. His father, Kumarswamy Nader, was a coconut merchant. Kamaraj was enrolled at the local elementary school, the Nayanar Vidyalaya but was later shifted to the high school Kshatriya Vidyalaya. Unfortunately his father died within a year of Kamaraj’s enrollment in school. Kamaraj’s mother sold all jewelry except her earrings and deposited the money with a local merchant and cared for the entire family on the monthly interest that the money earned. Kamaraj was not a good student in school and dropped out when he was in the sixth grade. When he entered mainstream public life he felt handicapped and realized the importance of a good education. He educated himself during his periods of imprisonment and even learned English from his co-worker. Kamaraj joined as an apprentice in his maternal uncle Karuppiah’s cloth shop after dropping out of school. He would slip out from the shop to join processions and attend public meetings addressed by orators like Dr. Varadarajulu Naidu and George Joseph. His relatives frowned upon Kamaraj ‘s budding interest in politics. 
At the age of 16, Kamaraj enrolled himself as full-time worker of the Congress. He participated in inviting speakers, organizing meetings and collecting funds for the party. He also participated in the march to Vedaranyam led by Rajagopalachari as part of the Salt Satyagraha of March 1930. Kamaraj was arrested and sent to Alipore Jail for two years. He was twenty seven at the time of arrest and was released in 1931 following the Gandhi-Iriwn Pact. 
While still in jail, Kamaraj was elected Chairman to the Municipal Council. Nine months later upon his release, Kamaraj went straight to the Municipality and tendered his resignation from his post. He felt that “one should not accept any post to which one could not do full justice.”

Translocation (botany)

Translocation in plants means the movement of liquids from place to place. Movement of water from the soil to the leaves is done in xylem vessels. Transpiration, the evaporation of water from leaves, causes a pull on the water column which and the water to move upwards. Organic materials, mainly produced in the leaves, are moved around the plant in the living cells of the phloem.
Transpiration was first worked out by Stephen Hales (17 September 1677 – 4 January 1761), an English clergyman. He proved what is still believed, that the evaporation of water molecules from leaves is the main force pulling the water column up from its origin in the roots.
Unlike xylem (which is composed of dead cells), the phloem is composed of still-living cells that transport sap. Sap is a water-based solution, rich in sugars made by the photosynthesis. These sugars are transported to non-photosynthetic parts of the plant, such as the roots, or into storage structures, such as tubers or bulbs.
The 'pressure flow' hypothesis was proposed by Ernst Münch in 1930 to explain the mechanism of phloem translocation. Leaves photosynthesise, making sugars. Water moves into the sugar-laden sieve-tube cells with sugar by osmosis. This creating pressure that pushes the sap down the sieve tube. When the sugar reaches cells that need it, the cells actively transport sugars out of the sieve-tube elements.
During the plant's growth period, usually during the spring, storage organs such as the roots are sugar sources, and the plant's many growing areas are sugar sinks. The movement in phloem is multi-directional, whereas, in xylem cells, it is one-directional (upwards). Other molecules like amino acids, hormones, and even messenger RNAs are also transported in the phloem through sieve tube elements.

Clara Oswald

Clara Oswald is a fictional character on the British science fiction television series "Doctor Who". She is portrayed by Jenna-Louise Coleman. She first appeared in the show's seventh series. Clara is a companion of the eleventh version of alien time traveller the Doctor (portrayed by Matt Smith).
During 2012 and 2013, the character is introduced as three different people with the same name. Each was played by the same actress. The first two incarnations die during the episode they appear in. The third becomes the Doctor's companion. While each one is different, the characters are meant to be seen as the same person. This sets up a mystery to be solved. Coleman took over as the show's female lead in the mid-series Christmas special. At that time, she was portraying Victorian governess and barmaid Clara Oswin Oswald. At the end of that episode, Coleman is seen playing a third version of the character. This character was from modern day London and was named Clara Oswald. Starting in the following episode, Clara Oswald travels as the Doctor's full-time companion. During her third introduction, she gives herself the nickname Oswin. It is a mixture of Oswald and win.
Coleman has said that she will be in the eighth series. It is to begin filming in September 2013.
Oswin Oswald is first seen in the first episode of the seventh series, "Asylum of the Daleks". She is the only survivor of the Starship "Alaska". The "Alaska" crashed on the Asylum, a prison planet for insane Daleks. She has lived on the planet for about a year when the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companions Amy (Karen Gillan) and Rory (Arthur Darvill) go to the Dalek Asylum to turn off the planet's force field. They are trying to do this so that an army of sane Daleks can destroy the asylum. Clara communicates with them and helps them escape from the Daleks. She also removes all of the Daleks' memories of the Doctor. She helps the group escape and the Doctor tries to rescue her. He soon learns that she has already been captured and is now a Dalek cyborg. The Daleks had tried to keep Oswin's intellect. Because her mind could not deal with being turned into a cyborg, it created a fantasy where she survived as a human. When she learned the truth, Oswin was almost taken over by her Dalek personality, but in the end she still would not kill the Doctor. She deactivated the force field. Clara makes a final request that the Doctor remember her. She then lets the Doctor, Amy, and Rory leave the planet before it is destroyed.
Clara is introduced a second time in the 2012 Christmas special "The Snowmen". This was her first episode as the Doctor's companion. She was a young barmaid and governess in 1892. She follows the Doctor after he saves her from an attack by living snowmen. The Doctor asks her to travel with him after she enters the TARDIS, his time and space machine. Soon after this, Clara falls to her death after being attacked. Her tombstone shows her full name to be "Clara Oswin Oswald". The Doctor sees that she is the same woman as Oswin from the Asylum. She even says the same things Oswin had said. Intrigued by a woman who has lived and died two times in different periods of history, he begins look across time for another Clara. The episode ends with a young woman, who could be a modern-day Clara, walking through the graveyard and stopping by Clara Oswin Oswald's tomb. In a short prequel to the post-Christmas episode, the Doctor meets the modern Clara Oswald as a child, but he does not know it is her. In "The Bells of Saint John", the modern Clara meets the Doctor after being given his phone number by a woman in a shop. After an adventure in London, the Doctor asks Clara to become his companion. In "The Rings of Akhaten", the Doctor tries to learn more about who (or what) Clara really is. After watching her parents and her childhood, he finds nothing that is not normal. The episode shows that her mother died when she was a teenager. In "Hide", the Doctor goes to a haunted mansion to ask the psychic Emma Grayling about Clara. She says Clara is just an ordinary girl. "Hide" and "Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS" also show that the TARDIS does not like Clara. In a version of time which was stopped from happening, the Doctor talks with Clara about the two previous versions of her he had met. She did not know what he is talking about.

Para-alpine skiing classification

Para-alpine skiing classification is the order system for para-Alpine skiing designed to give equal competition between alpine skiers with different types of limited physical powers. The system of ordering are grouped into three general condition of being unable sorts: stand, unable to see and being seated. Group selection is done by International Paralympic Committee AlpineSkiing. Prior to that, several groups dealt with this including the International Sports Organization for the Disabled (ISOD), International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMWSF), International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) and Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA). Some order systems are persons given government by bodies other than International Paralympic Committee Alpine skiing, such as the Special Olympics. The sport is open to all competitors with a no seeing or physical condition of being unable stand. It is not open to people with intellectual disabilities.
The first order systems for para-Alpine sking were made in Scandinavia in the 1960s, with early systems designed for skiers with no legs or arms. At the time, necessary things had yet to be done to let skiers with spinal cord wounds ski. The purpose of the early order systems was to be made around use of arms and legs but ended up being a medical order system. At the first Winter Paralympics in 1976, there were two groups in the system of ordering for the sport. By the 1980s, groups had existence for skiers with cerebral palsy. At that time, with inspiration from wheelchair basketball classification, efforts were made to make order more of an able to use better system. Ten groups had existence by the 1980s, and since then, efforts have been made to make better the doing work well of order by making fewer the number of classes so fewer medals can be rewarded.
Competition rules for groups use rules made by or are an adjustment from rules by the International Ski Federation. For skiers with seeing problems, guides are used to help the skier down the mountain. For standing skiers, different part rules come to a decision about what sort of necessary things is let in competition, such as one long stick, two sticks or no sticks, or one or two skis. Seated skiers use a specially designed ski for going over snow quickly called a mono-ski. Skiers are put in a group based on medical, and their body position when they ski. Unable to see skiers are put in order only on a medical.

Harry Chapman Pincher (29 March 1914 – 5 August 2014) was an Indian-born British journalist, historian, and novelist.
Pincher was born on 29 March 1914 in Ambala, Punjab. His father was from Britain and his mother was American. Pincher studied at Darlington Grammar School and King's College London. 
Pinker wrote a series of books on supposed KGB spies in the West, mostly members of the British ruling class whom he believed were traitors in the service of the KGB. Among these were Roger Hollis, former head of MI5, and Harold Wilson, twice Prime Minister in the 1960s and 70s. 
Many of these ideas had come from James Jesus Angleton, former CIA counterespionage chief. Angleton's career ended when his many allegations were not supported with appropriate evidence. Among his more outrageous claims was that Canadian Prime Ministers Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau were agents of the Soviet Union.
Another source was Peter Wright, a former assistant director of MI5. The British Government tried to prevent the publication of Wright's own "Spycatcher" (1987), which covered much the same ground as Pincher's "Their trade is treachery". Wright had published in Australia, and the Australian court case ran on for years with no success. In the event, nothing was proved against Hollis, who was the main target of "Their trade is treachery". Later British Prime Ministers stated that Hollis was a loyal servant of the Crown, and that a great injustice had been done to him by the Pincher and Wright books.
Pincher died on 5 August 2014 at the age of 100.

Our Lady of La Vang

Our Lady of La Vang was a reported Marian apparition (a supernatural appearance of the Virgin Mary) in Vietnam. The appearance was reported at a time when Catholics were being persucted and killed in Vietnam. In Vietnamese she is called ' or '. 
Modern scholars believe the name came from a plant in the area ("La" means "leaf" and "Vang" means "herbal seeds"). Others believe the name came from a Vietnamese word that meant "crying out" as if the Vietnamese Catholics at that time were "crying out" to God for help. Some believe the name came from the rainforest's name La Vang.
Fearing the spread of Catholicism, Emperor Canh Thinh banned the practice of Catholicism. Soon thereafter the emperor made an anti-Catholic edict which made the practice of Catholicism punishable by death. Many Catholics sought refuge in the rainforest of La Vang in Quang Tri Province. While hiding in the rainforest, the small community would gather every night at the foot of a tree and pray. One night, an apparition surprised them. In the branches of the tree, a lady dressed in the traditional Vietnamese dress (ao dai), holding an infant in her arms with two angels beside her, appeared. The people who witnessed this apparition said that the lady and the infant was the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus. They said that the lady comforted them and told them to boil the leaves from the tree for medicine to cure the illness.
In 1802, many of the Catholics went back to their villages, spreading the story of the apparition. Soon, many people came back to the site to offer incense and to pray. In 1820, a chapel was built. From 1830- 1885 another wave of persecutions decimated the Catholic population. The chapel of Our Lady of La Vang was destroyed and in 1886 a new chapel was built.
There is no official recognition from the Vatican for this as a "Marian apparition". Although there is no official recognition, Pope John Paul II publicly recognized the importance of Our Lady of La Vang and expressed a desire to rebuild the La Vang Basilica to honor the 200th anniversary of the first apparition.

Our Lady of Good Health

Our Lady of Good Health is the name given to an apparition of the Virgin Mary believed to have appeared in the town of Vailankanni, Tamil Nadu, India. She is also known as Our Lady of Vailankanni and Holy Mother of Good Health. Her name in the Tamil language is (Arokia Matha).
The Feast day of Our Lady of Good Health is on the same day as the birthday of the Virgin Mary (September 8).
Although there is no written record of these three events, the oral tradition is that there were three apparitions. Two were during the 16th century and one in the 17th century.
The first apparition was in the town of Vailankanni, Tamil Nadu. It is said that a Hindu boy was resting under a banyan tree near a pond. While he was resting, a woman with an infant on her hand came to him and asked him for milk. The boy agreed and ran off to get the milk. When he came back, he apologized for his lateness and the reduced amount of milk due to an accident when he was coming back with the milk. However, on inspection the boy found the pot of milk to be full and was convinced a miracle happened. Together a man, also a Hindu, and the boy went back to the pond where the apparition had occurred. Again, the Lady appeared with her child. On learning that it was the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus who appeared to the boy, the residents of the local Roman Catholic community became ecstatic and renamed the pond "" (Our Lady's Pond).
Later towards the end of the 16th century, it is believed the Virgin Mary appeared to a crippled boy (and also a son of a widow) in a place called Thittu, once again in the same town of Vailankanni. The boy is said to have offered buttermilk to the Virgin Mary and then he was cured of his illness. The boy was then commanded by Mary to tell a Catholic gentleman in the nearby town of Nagapattinam. The first shrine was built by this Catholic gentleman.
The third appearance of the Virgin Mary was in the 17th century. A Portuguese merchant vessel was sailing from Macau in China to Colombo in Sri Lanka. When the vessel was sailing, it was caught in a storm in the Bay of Bengal. The sailors vowed to build a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary if they could reach land safely. The legend claimed that the sea became quiet and they reached safety on the shore of Vailankanni on the Virgin Mary's birthday, September 8.

Erode Venkata Ramasamy (17 September 1879 – 24 December 1973), also called Periyar, Thanthai Periyar or E. V. R. by his followers, was an Indian businessman, politician, independence and social activist. He started the Self-Respect Movement or the Dravidian Movement and proposed the creation of an independent state called Dravida Nadu, comprising the states of South India. He is also the founder of the socio-cultural organisation, Dravidar Kazhagam.
Periyar was born in Erode, Madras Presidency to a rich family of Kannada-speaking Balijas. At a young age, he witnessed many incidents of racial, caste and gender discrimination. Periyar married when he was 19, and had a daughter who lived for only 5 months. His first wife, Nagammai, died in 1933. Periyar married for a second time in July 1948. His second wife, Maniammai, continued Periyar's social work after his death in 1973, but still his thoughts and ideas were being spread by Dravidar Kazhagam.
Periyar fought for the Tamil language, Tamil people and for their rights until his death. He was against Brahmin for their caste and religious following. Periyar organised anti-Hindi protests in 1938, against the introduction of Hindi as a compulsory language of study in schools. Now in the present days the Periyar's followers are increasing more all over the world among the Tamil people, due to their interest in Tamil language and history behind them.

Cyclone Viyaru

Cyclonic Storm Mahasen was an active tropical cyclone. It had gone over the Bay of Bengal. It had threaten Myanmar and Bangladesh. Its origin was a low pressure area in the Bay of Bengal. The low pressure area was created in the first week of May. Mahasen slowly developed. It became a depression on May 10 by almost remaining still. Gradually it gained speed on May 11 and became a cyclonic storm. It was the first storm of the season. At first the system's ultimate direction was not clear, but moved closer to eastern India. On May 14, the circulation of Mahasen turned northeastward.
Myanmar recommended a large evacuation in order to be prepared for the storm; however, for this reason people wanted to escape by boat. As a result, they made boats overcrowded, and one or more boats capsized. This killed at least eight people. The storm had extensive cloud mass, which brought unsettled weather to Sri Lanka, Thailand, and southeastern India. Severe storms in India and Sri Lanka killed 15 people and caused major damage. One person was killed in Thailand. 
The name "Mahasen" caused some argument from nationalists and officials in Sri Lanka. They claimed that the name Mahasen comes from a Sinhala king. He brought prosperity to the island. So naming a destructive force of nature after him would be improper. Sri Lankan authorities instead have not given the storm a name.
Cyclone Mahasen struck Southern Bangladesh on 16 May 2013. The speed of the wind was about 100 kph.
An area of convection first appeared on May 4. It slowly moved eastwards and organized into a low pressure area on May 8. A pulse in the Madden–Julian oscillation, together with a convective Kelvin wave allowed the system to develop. These oscillations also caused Tropical Storm Jamala to form. The JTWC later issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on May 10, after the system became more organized. The IMD upgraded it to a well-marked low pressure area. Later the same day, JTWC issued the first warning for the storm. JTWC designed it 01B, followed by the IMD upgrading the storm into a depression, and later into a deep depression.
As of 0830 IST (0300 UTC), 16 May 2013, Cyclonic Storm Mahasen was located near latitude 21°N and longitude 90°E, about south-southeast of Kolkata and southwest of Chittagong. The storm is forecast to maintain power. It is moving northeastwards. It is expected to cross the Bangladesh coast close to Chittagong by evening of 16 May. Sustained maximum surface wind speed is estimated at , gusting to . Estimated minimum central pressure is at 988 mbar. Dvorak intensity of the storm is at T2.5.

Engineering tolerance is the ability of a machine to cope with changes while still continuing to work. This includes changes to size, quality (for example, the smoothness of the surface), the outside world (for example, dampness or heat). When a machine is made the needed engineering tolerance is set to provide a balance between performance and the need to cope with the changes it may experience.

Bioturbation

Bioturbation is the reworking of soils and sediments by animals or plants. It disturbs and changes sediment. Any animal living in the soil or on the bottom under water may disturb the sediment by moving it around. Burrowing, eating and defecation of sediment grains, building galleries (etc.) all disturb the sediment.
Common bioturbators include annelids ("ringed worms") such as oligochaetes, bivalves like mussels, clams, gastropods, holothurians. 
Fossil sites with bioturbation do not leave traces of soft-bodied animals. In contrast, fossil sites with undisturbed sediment have given rise to important lagerstätten with many impressions of small soft-bodied invertebrates.

Para-alpine skiing

Alpine skiing is a winter sport. This sport has been adapted to the needs of people with a disability, and is called Para-alpine skiing. The sport started in Germany and Austria during and after the Second World War. The sport is governed by the International Paralympic Committee Sports Committee. The adaptations used include ski poles (outrigger skis), and a chair on a ski (sit-skis, and mono-skis). Para-alpines skiing types are Downhill, Super-G, Giant Slalom, Slalom, Super Combined and Snowboard.
Para-alpine skiing classification is the order system for para-alpine skiing. It is designed to give equal competition between alpine skiers with different types of limited physical powers and vision. The ordering system is grouped into three general conditions of being unable: standing, unable to see and sitting. A factoring system was made for para-alpine skiing. It lets the three classification groups fairly race against other people with the same type of disability.
Alpine skiing was one of the sports at the first Winter Paralympics in 1976 with Slalom and Giant Slalom being raced. Different types of Alpine skiing were made to be at the Paralympic Games over time. The 2010 Winter Paralympics para-alpine skiing races were at Whistler Creekside. The race types at Whistler included Downhill, Super-Combined, Super-G, Slalom and Giant Slalom.
Disability skiing started around the Second World War, because many soldiers got hurt. In Germany, Franz Wendel, an amputee who was missing his leg, used pair of crutches to make short skis. Sepp "Peppi" Zwicknagel is an Austrian veteran was wounded by a hand grenade and lost his leg. Zwicknagel learned to ski on his own and then became a ski instructor. He worked at Kitzbühel, and created a division of the Austrian Ski Association for disability skiers. By 1947, disability ski races were being held in Austria. Next, Ludwig Guttman helped make ski events for people with disabilities. In the United States, Gretchen Fraser started teaching skiing to amputees in army hospitals. By the 1960s, ski groups for people with disabilities were being made. Disability skiing was only for people amputations until 1968. In 1969, blind skier Jean Eymore began a skiing program in Aspen, Colorado for skiers who cannot see. Eymore was ski instructor before he lost his vision. The first international competition, the World Disabled Alpine Championships, was held in France in 1974.
Standing alpine skiing was one of the first sports at the first Winter Paralympics in 1976. Slalom and Giant Slalom were the race types held. At the 1984 Winter Paralympics, the downhill event was added to the para-alpine program. Sit-skiing was a example sport in 1984. At the 1992 Winter Paralympics in Albertville, Canada, downhill, giant slalom and slalom events were on the Paralympic program. At the 1994 Winter Paralympics, Super Giant Slalom was raced. In 1998, sit-skiers and blind skiers could get medals. Before 1998, only standing skiers could get medals at the Winter Paralympics.
At the 2002 Winter Paralympics, women's downhill and men's unable to see downhill were on day 1. Men's standing and being seated downhill were on day 2. Men's standing and being seated Super-G was on day 3. Men's unable to see and women's Super-G was on day 5. Men's standing and being seated Giant Slalom was on day 7. Women's and men's unable to see Giant Slalom was on day 8. Men's standing and being seated Slalom was on day 9. Women's and men's unable to see Slalom was on day 10.
At the 2006 Winter Paralympics, a new classification system was used. It made 14 classes into three groups and used factored results for each of three groups. At the 2006 Games, in the Super-G, there were 55 male competitors compared to 18 women in the standing group.
The 2010 Winter Paralympics para-alpine skiing race were at Whistler Creekside. The types of races at Whistler included downhill, Super-Combined, Super-G, slalom and giant slalom. Super-combined was raced in 2010. It was the first time it was raced at the Paralympic Games. In the downhill races, there were 25 men and 18 women in the standing group, 25 men and 10 women in the being seated group and 12 men and 10 women in the cannot see group. In the Super-Combined races, there were 18 men and 14 women for standing, 18 men and 10 women for being seated and 10 men and 10 women for cannot see. The slalom race was shortest race course for para-alpine events at the 2010 Games. The downhill was on day 2 for men and women skiers in all groups. The Super-G for men and women in standing classes was on day 3. Cannot see and being seated skiers raced in the Super-G on day 4. The Super Combined races were on day 5 for all skiers. The standing Giant Slalom for men and women was on day 7. The being seated and cannot skiers raced on day 8. The slalom wasfor standing men and women was on day 9. The other skiers raced the slalom on day 10.
Para-alpine ski events held with skiers from around the world and for skiers from specific countries include the Winter Paralympics, World championships World cups, Continental cups, National championships IPCAS competition and IPCAS Para-Snowboard. Skiers from 39 different countries race in para-alpine skiing races. The sport is that one of eight given government by the International Paralympic Committee Sports Committee, with rules for para-alpine skiing put forth in the IPCAS Rules and Regulations. Special rules may be used for events like the Paralympic Games. One group of special rules was used in 1994 and were detailed in the IPC Handbook. This was used to make necessary IPC-sanctioned events like the Paralympic Games for many years. Competition rules for classes use rules put by or made an adjustment from rules made come into existence by the International Ski Federation (FIS). These rules were put at the 42nd International Ski Conference in 2000. The two rule groups worked in united ways with each other, with the FIS rules specifying the rules for alpine skiing, and the IPC making ready adjustments for para-alpine skiing. The IPC Alpine Sports Assembly Executive Committee can come to a decision about if skiers are having necessary qualities to race in IPC sanctioned events without thought or attention of what the rules say. National Paralympic Committees can have their own rule for races they organize.
The first necessary things used in the sport includes outrigger skis, sit-skis, and mono-skis. Being dependent on if a skier sits, stands or cannot see, other necessary things may be used by skiers other equipment may be used by skiers including guide skiers, short ski poles, orthopedic aids, or prostheses. For skiers with seeing problems, guides are used to help the skier know the direction to ski. [10] For skiers who stand, different part rules come to a decision about what sort of necessary things is let in competition, such as one long ski pole, two ski poles, zero ski poles, or one or two skis. Rules for necessary things use in competition are made by FIS and the IPC.
There are least long distance for skis used in competition is at least for men and for women. Bindings used for skis have a greatest point high level of .
Sit-skis are for wheelchair users or other skiers who have paraplegia. The first sit-ski was made in 1967 by Josef Shrall. Shrall is from the Bavaria in Germany. The first sit-skis had two wide skis, brakes, and were made special to fit a skier. The weight of the sit-ski made it so no skiers could ski moguls or on steep slopes. Sit-ski kept getting made better in 1980s. A new type of sit-ski was made in Engelberg, Switzerland in 1987 and people were able to see it at a workshop made by the Swiss Association of Paraplegics. As the technology got better, a chair was made that could be added to the skis which were made for skiers who had no disability. Now sit-skis are made from fiberglass and polyester. Sit-skis now have much less weight, allowing skiers to ski on steeper slopes and race in the moguls. Now sit-skis include seat belts. Sit-skis for people with disabilities and skis for people who do not have disabilities have improved to become special for different types of alpine skiing races.
Some standing skiers can use outrigger skis when racing. These are ski poles with small skis on the end. They help a skier balance when they ski down a mountain, and help in going short distances up a mountain. Outrigger skis also help skiers to do things like a climb a hill to get on a ski lift.
Guide skiers can see. They help skiers who cannot ski go down the mountain by telling the cannot see skier where to go using a radio or talking to them. Skiers can use more than one guide during a race type, but the guide can only win a medal if they raced with the same skier for the whole race type. Like the skier, the guide has to have an IPCAS Licence in order to compete in races. Guide skiers need to follow to anti-doping rules.
Skiers also wear special boots, helmets, ski suits, and goggles. Ski equipment cannot have advertisements on it at the Paralympic Games. Ski boots are made to connect to the ski at the heel and toe. They help support the foot and ankle with the use of materials like hard plastics. All helmets used in races must be hard-shell helmets.
Para-alpine skiing types are downhill, Super-G, Giant Slalom, Slalom, Super Combined and Snowboard. The rules are based on the rules of the International Ski Federation, though some rules have been adjusted for skiers with limited physical powers. While skiing, skiers go as quickly as an hour.
This is a go quickly based timed ski race, where skiers go over snow quickly down a sloping sharply direction that can be to lower than it started while having in it many turns and jumps. The first skier to finish is based on one run down the mountain, with the skier with the fastest time being the first. Skiers move between gates in the downhill. Downhill has the least number gates among all para-alpine types. If a skier does not ski between the gates, they do not finish. Some ski races make a skier first show they are good enough to ski. They can make this be seen in the downhill or Super-G. Skiers can get points for competitions with skiers from other countries in races by International Ski Federation. Skiers can race in the downhill at the Paralympic Games.
Skis for women must be at least long. For men, skis must be at least long. Women and men's skis need a least possible or recorded straight line from middle to edge circle turn of . Skiers used curved narrow ski poles for this event. Men and women both need their skis to have a straight line from middle to edge circle of . Top speed in this event can be up to an hour. Before the start of the race, the skier needs to do a practice run, and need to wear a helmet to keep safe during all their runs. 
Made in the 1980s, the Super-G is less scientific with skiers going very fast. From top to bottom part of the mountain, skiers go down to high. Acomparison to other para-alpine sking types, this type has a tendency to be mid-length. It is longer than the Giant Slalom and the Slalom but shorter than the downhill type. In this type, skiers go quickly between alternating red and blue gates that are apart , with men needing to go between 35 gates and women needing to go between 30 gates. 
With a drop of to , this is one of the more need to be very correct when turning the para-alpine disciplines. This skiing type gets two runs down a mountain that is straighter and shorter than the downhill. It is longer and having fewer turns than the Slalom. After the first race down the mountain, the last 20% of finishers can be took away from the competition at the authority of the judges. The starting order for the second run is starts with the slowest of the top 15 skiers, with the fastest skier in the first race racing 15th. Any skiers who completed outside the top 15 then race in order based on their times from the first run. For example, the 18th fastest finisher in the first run skis 18th in the second run. In some competitions, an adjustment is made using 30 skiers instead of 15. The IPC/FIS run together make the rules for Slalom race. Giant Slalom is a race on the current Paralympic schedule. Skiers use straight ski poles in Giant Slalom.
The name for this race is from a Norwegian word that is "sloping footway." This event is the most complex ski discipline, with a drop of only to on an purposely iced mountain. This is the shortest of all the para-alpine race events and uses two different races with different directions down a mountain. Skiers go down each different race once, with their coming to an end position being marked based on their complete time from both races. There are gates in this race, about 55-75 for men and 40-60 for women, and if a skier does ski between the gate, they are unable to finish the race because of the rules. After the first race, the last 20% of finishers can be took away from the competition at the authority of the judges. The starting order for the second run is starts with the slowest of the top 15 skiers, with the fastest skier in the first run skiing 15th. Any skiers who completed outside the top 15 then skiers race in order based on their times from the first run. For example, the 18th fastest finisher in the first run skis 18th in the second run. Skiers use straight ski poles in this race. In some competitions that have a need to show people you should be allowed to race in it, a skier can show they should be allowed to race using finish race times from downhill, Slalom or Super-G. The IPC/FIS make the rules for Slalom. Slalom is a race on the current Paralympic schedule. Skiers often wear extra protective equipment when racing in slalom.
The Super Combined is a mix of two disciplines: Slalom and Super-G, or the downhill and the Slalom. In the event, skiers go down the downhill mountain race once, and the Slalom mountain race twice. The times for the three races are put together, with the fastest time for all three races being the skier who finishes first.
Snowboard has drops between and for both men's and women's races with the race being run over a distance of to . The race has alternating ski gates. The sport is only open to standing racers.
Para-alpine skiing classification is designed to give insurance equal competition between alpine skiers with different types of limited physical and seeing powers. The system of ordering are grouped into three general conditions of being unable sorts: standing, unable to see and sitting. The International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing is the boss of classification. Skiers are put in order based on medical problems, and their body position when they ski. Skiers cannot see are valued only on a medical doctors saying how bad their vision is. Prior to International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing being in charge, several sport groups handled classification. They included the International Sports Organization for the Disabled (ISOD), International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMWSF), International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) and Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA). Some order systems are persons given organizations other than International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing. These order systems are not used in international competition. The sport is open to all competitors with a seeing or physical condition of being unable. It is not open to people with to do with intellectual disabilties.
The first order systems for para-alpine classification were made in Scandinavia, with early systems designed for skiers with amputations. At the time, there was no ski tools for skiers with spinal cord wounds. The purpose of the early order systems was to be made from able to use your body but ended up being medical order systems. At the first Winter Paralympics in 1976, there were two systems of classification for the sport. By the 1980s, skiers with cerebral palsy had a classification system. At that time, with inspiration from wheelchair basketball order, efforts were made to make order more of a able to use the body classification system. Ten classes had existence by the 1980s. Since then, efforts have been made to make better the classification system by lowering the number of classes so fewer medals can be awarded.
A factoring system was made come into existence for para-alpine skiing for three general groups: being seated, standing and not seeing. Each group races against only people in the same group. A skier can finish in the top three for only seated, standing or not seeing. People from one group do not race against other skiers in a different group. Inside each group, there is a wide range of able to move and medical problems or being able to see. Skiers are classed inside one of the three groups. The factoring system works by having a number for each class, where the results are worked out by increasing in number the look time by the factored number. The coming out number is the one used to come to a decision about the one who came out best in events where the cause system is used. This means the quicker skier down a hill may not be the first of an event. in events where the factor system is used. This means the faster skier down a hill may not be the winner of an event. The factor system is used at Alpine Cup, North American Races, European Cup, World Cup races, World Championships, and the Winter Paralympics.

European badger

The European badger ("Meles meles") is a species of badger. Its genus is "Meles". It is native to almost all of Europe. It is classed as Least Concern for extinction by the IUCN because of its wide distribution and large population.
The European badger is a social, burrowing animal. It eats a wide variety of plants and animals. It is very fussy over the cleanliness of its burrow, and defecates in latrines. It is known of European badgers that they bury their dead family members. Although they are ferocious when provoked, the European badger is generally a peaceful animal. It has been known to share its burrows with other species such as rabbits, red foxes and raccoon dogs. Although it does not usually prey on domestic animals, the species is sometimes reported to damage livestock through spreading bovine tuberculosis.

Outrigger skis are skis that are used by para-skiers to help with balance, turn, control their rate of motion, stop and make greater the direction of turns. They be different in size and level, and have different things. Being dependent on the total number of skis used by the skier (1 or 2), outrigger ski form is sometimes named "Three Track Skiing" or "Four Track Skiing". When falling, skiers are taught to move their arms to put a stop to falling on the outrigger ski and damaging themselves.

Eddie Mabo

Eddie Koiki Mabo ( 29 June 1936 – 21 January 1992) was an Indigenous Australian activist from the Torres Strait Islands. He became well known for campaigning for indigenous land rights. In particular, he became famous for his role in an historic decision by the High Court of Australia in 1992, which overturned the idea that Australia was "terra nullius" (land belonging to nobody).
Mabo was born as Eddie Koiki Sambo. He changed his surname to Mabo when he was adopted by his mother's brother, Benny Mabo. He was born on Mer (Murray Island) in the Torres Strait between Australia and Papua New Guinea. He worked on a number of jobs before becoming a gardener with James Cook University in Townsville, when he was 31 years old. The time he spent on the university campus had a major impact on his life. In 1974, Mabo was surprised to learn that his family did not legally own the land they lived on. In a conversation with Noel Loos and Henry Reynolds, he learned that legally that land belonged to the Crown.
In 1981, a conference on land rights was held at James Cook University. Mabo made a speech to the audience where he explained the indigenous customary land inheritance system on Murray Island. One of the people who attended the conference, a lawyer, suggested they should make a case to claim land rights through the court system. A case was made, and took 10 years to reach a decision. Mabo died a few months before the decision. He died on 21 January 1992, of cancer at the age of 55.
Five months later, on 3 June 1992, the High Court overturned the legal doctrine of "terra nullius" - which was the term applied to the attitude of the British Empire towards land ownership on the continent of Australia. That decision is now commonly called "Mabo v Queensland" in Australia and is widely recognised for its importance. Later in 1992, Mabo was awarded the Australian Human Rights Medal for his work over many years to gain legal recognition for indigenous people's rights.
Three years after Mabo died, which is the traditional mourning period for the people of Murray Island, a memorial service was held in Townsville. Overnight, his grave was vandalised; it was spray-painted with swastikas and the word "abo" (a derogatory slang term for an Aboriginal person). His family decided to have his body reburied on Murray Island.

Peter Browne

Peter Browne (ca. 1594 1633) was a passenger on the "Mayflower" and a signer of the Mayflower Compact. In some records he was called Brown and others as Browne. He was baptized on January 26, 1594/5 in Dorking, Surrey, England. This was the same home town where William Mullins, another "Mayflower" passengers lived. Browne was a son of William Brown of Dorking. He had an older sister and four brothers.
Browne was around 25 when he boarded the "Mayflower" with the Mullins family. Unfortunately the Mullins family died shortly after they landed in the New World.
The Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" saw land. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in the Colony of Virginia, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor. They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other.
An interesting incident regarding Browne took place in January 1621 while the Pilgrims were building their settlement of Plymouth. On January 12 Peter Browne, John Goodman and others had entered the forest in order to find thatch for their roofs. Sometime around noon, Browne and Goodman wandered further into the forest while the other men stayed behind to bundle the thatch. They realized that Browne and Goodman were still in the forest and they went to the settlement and told the others. This caused about 10-12 men to search for them. As it happened, Browne and Goodman were eating lunch when their dogs starting chasing a deer and they were soon lost. According to records, they walked all that afternoon and were wet, and at night it got very cold. They had no weapons but had one sickle each. At night they thought they heard lions in the forest and climbed a tree for shelter. They stayed by the tree that night in case they had to escape to safety. The next day they finally climbed the highest hill they could find, were able to see where they were and were able to get back to the colony. Browne and Goodman finally arrived in Plymouth quite cold, forest-bitten, tired and hungry. This was the first time they had gone into the forest in the New England.
In the Plymouth settlement of 1620, the house of Peter Browne was near that of John Goodman and was close to the harbor on the south side of the village street.
In the 1623 Division of Land, as a single man, Browne received one “acre” of land near a brook. In that record, his name appears as “Peter Browen". Sometime after the Division of Land, he married the widow Martha Ford. She arrived in November 1621 on the ship "Fortune" as the only recorded woman on board.
By the time of the 1627 Division of the Cattle, Browne and his wife had a daughter Mary and was pregnant with another daughter, Priscilla.
Martha died about 1630, and Browne remarried and had two more children.
Brown became sick and died in 1633. He and his first wife were buried at Burial Hill in Plymouth.

Bar-tailed godwit

The bar-tailed godwit ("Limosa lapponica") is a water bird. It is a large wader in the family Scolopacidae. It breeds on Arctic coasts and tundra mainly in the Old World, and winters on coasts in temperate and tropical regions of the Old World. 
Its migration is the longest known non-stop flight of any bird and also the longest journey without pausing to feed by any animal.
The bar-tailed godwit migrates in flocks to coasts in East Asia, Alaska, Australia, Africa, northwestern Europe and New Zealand, where the sub-species "Limosa lapponica baueri" is called Kūaka in Māori. 
In 2007 birds in New Zealand were tagged and tracked by satellite to the Yellow Sea in China. According to Clive Minton (Australasian Wader Studies Group) "The distance between these two places is , but the actual track flown by the bird was ". The flight took about nine days.This is the longest known non-stop flight of any bird. At least three other bar-tailed godwits reached the Yellow Sea after non-stop flights from New Zealand.
One female in the flock, nicknamed "E7", flew onward from China to Alaska and stayed there for the breeding season. Then on 29 August 2007 she departed on a non-stop flight from the Avinof Peninsula in western Alaska to the Piako River near Thames New Zealand, setting a new known flight record of .

Sandpiper

Sandpipers are a large family of waders or shorebirds, the Scolopacidae. They include many species called sandpipers, as well as those called by names such as curlew and snipe. Most species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Different lengths of bills allow different species to feed in the same habitat on the coast without direct competition for food.
Sandpipers have long bodies and legs, and narrow wings. Most species have a narrow bill, but otherwise the form and length are quite variable. They are small to medium sized birds, measuring cm in length. The bills are sensitive, allowing the birds to feel the mud and sand as they probe for food. They generally have dull plumage, with cryptic brown, grey, or streaked patterns, although some display brighter colours during the breeding season.
Most species nest in open areas, and defend their territories with aerial displays. The nest itself is a simple scrape in the ground, in which the bird usually lays three or four eggs. The young of most species are precocial.

Saint Helena plover

The Saint Helena plover ("Charadrius sanctaehelenae"), locally known as the wirebird, is a small bird (a plover) endemic to the island of Saint Helena.
The bird was first mentioned in 1638, and is the national bird of Saint Helena; it appears on the top half of the island's coat of arms. Some older coins of Saint Helena (before 1998) have the Wirebird on its reverse.
The Saint Helena plover is the only bird species endemic to the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena that is still living.
It is a small bird (length: 15 cm) with long and thin legs, like wires; because of that, the bird is known as "wirebird" in Saint Helena.
Kittlitz's plover ("Charadrius pecuarius") is the Saint Helena bird's closest relative; for some authors, the Saint Helena Plover is a subspecies of the Kittlitz's plover but most zoologists think that they are two different species.
The Saint Helena plover spends most of its time on the ground and does not fly frequently; it is most commonly found in pairs, or sometimes in small groups of young birds, looking for food (snails, beetles and other invertebrates) in grassland o in semi-desert areas.
Breeding takes place throughout the year, but mainly during the dry season, from late September to January. The nest is on the ground where they lay two eggs. After leaving the nest, the young birds move throughout the island in small groups.
The Saint Helena plover is endemic to the island of Saint Helena; it does not exist in any other place. Over the past 20 years, the species has used only of the whole island. The best places in the island to see them are Deadwood and Properous Bay Plains and Woody Ridge.
Saint Helena plovers like areas of land with grasses (pastures) that are at middle elevations, mainly in flat, dry areas with low plants.
Because of changes in the use of the land and the introduction of predators (rats, cats, dogs and other species), the number of individuals of the Saint Helena plover is critically low. A census carried out during 2005 and 2006 showed that this species had been reduced in about 40 percent in just five years to only 235 individuals. There has since been a small increase in numbers, however.
The Saint Helena plover is protected by law on Saint Helena since 1894, and several organisations work to conserve this species; one of the organizations helping to conserve this species is The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which has a project named "Enabling the people of St Helena to conserve the St Helena wirebird", as part of the Overseas Territories Environment Programme of the UK.

Our Lady of La Salette

Our Lady of La Salette is a title given to the Virgin Mary who is believed to have appeared at the village of La Salette, France. The apparition was reported by two children, Maximin Giraud, and Melanie Calvat. In French she is called "".
On 19 September 1846, Maximin Giraud and Melanie Calvat reported seeing the Virgin Mary weeping on Mount Sous-les Baisses. According to their account, the Virgin Mary continued to weep as she spoke to them, first in French, then in their own dialect. After the woman spoke to them, she vanished. The following day the children's account of the apparition was put into writing and signed by the children and those who had heard the story. 
When Maximin and Melanie made the woman's message public, it caused a sensation in the community. Soon thereafter, the bishop of Grenoble began to investigate the apparition. During the investigation, several accusations were made against the children. One of the accusations was that the apparition was just a young woman named Lamerliere. In 1851, the bishop said that the apparition was worthy of belief. This was the first step in approval by the Catholic church.
The visionaries sent two secrets to Pope Pius IX - one given to each of them, which they never revealed to one another. The Pope never made the two secrets public. However Melanie published the secrets in a pamphlet with the local bishop's approval. The Church condemned the published secret. Melanie, later in life, was known to have been disturbed by reading apocalyptic books and similar materials. 
John Paul II stated: As I wrote on the occasion of the 150th anniversary, "La Salette is a message of hope, for our hope is nourished by the intercession of her who is the Mother of mankind".
The message of the visionaries of La Salette focuses on the conversion of all humanity to Christ. Though La Salette's message is embedded in the bygone environment of the nineteenth century, rural France, it has had a tremendous impact on the modern world. Saints (for example, John Vianney), pastors (such as Don Bosco), and religious writers (like J.K. Huysmans) have all been influenced by La Salette. The spirit of La Salette is one of prayer, conversion, and commitment.

Division of Bennelong

The Division of Bennelong is an Australian electorate in New South Wales. The division was set up in 1949. It is named for Bennelong, an Indigenous Australian man who became a friend of the first Governor of New South Wales, Arthur Phillip. Bennelong includes the suburbs of Eastwood, Carlingford, Epping and Ryde.
When the Division of Bennelong was created in 1949, it covered mainly the suburbs of Ryde, Hunters Hill and Lane Cove. These were (and still are) richer areas, and Bennelong was a "safe" Liberal seat.
Over the years Bennelong has changed into a marginal seat for two reasons. Firstly, the electoral boundary of Bennelong has been changed many times, where it has moved west into Labor voting areas. Rich suburbs like Lane Cove and Hunters Hill in the east are no longer included. The division now includes Eastwood, Epping, Carlingford and working class Ermington in the north and west. Secondly, the type of people living in the division has changed. Since the early 1990s, there has been an increase in migrants from China, Hong Kong, South Korea and India. These are wealthy and conservative people who would support the Liberal Party, but they have not like the Liberal policies on immigration and multiculturalism.
Bennelong was held by the John Howard, the second longest serving Prime Minister of Australia. In 2010 the seat was won by former tennis star, John Alexander.

Bennelong

Woollarawarre Bennelong (c. 1764 – 3 January 1813) "(also: "Baneelon")" was an Indigenous Australian man of the Eora people. He was living in the Port Jackson area when the British came to Australia in 1788. Bennelong became an unofficial ambassador between the Eora and the British, both in Sydney and later in the United Kingdom.
Bennelong was a member of the Wangal clan who lived on the south side of Parramatta River. He had close links with the Wallumedegal clan who lived on the west side of the river, and the Burramattagal clan who lived near today's Parramatta. He had several sisters, including Warreeweer and Carangarang, who married important men from other clans. This gave Bennelong strong political links to the clans living around the new settlement at Sydney. Bennelong had a daughter named Dilboong who died as a baby, and a son who was adopted by Rev. William Walker. Named as Thomas Walker Coke, he died after a short illness aged about 20.
King George III had ordered the governor, Arthur Phillip, to set up friendly links with the Aborigines. However this was difficult as the Eora would not come anywhere near the new settlers. Phillip decided to kidnap an Eora person so that he could learn their language and their customs. A man named Arabanoo was captured, but he died from smallpox a few months later in May 1789. The disease had caused a lot of deaths among the Aborigines around Sydney. In November 1789, Bennelong, aged about 25, and a woman named Colbee were taken prisoner by a group of soldiers and taken to Sydney Cove. Colbee was able to escape two weeks later. The guard was hit with a whip 100 times for not stopping her escape. Bennelong was kept as a prisoner in the Governor's house. He wore clothes and enjoyed European food and drink. He was able to learn to speak English very quickly and became a friend of Phillip. After six months Bennelong escaped to go back to his clan.
Phillip visited Manly where he was speared in the shoulder, most likely as punishment for the kidnappings. Bennelong was at Manly, but did not take part in the attack on Phillip. He was worried about Phillip's injury, and returned to the settlement to make sure he was alright. Phillip told Bennelong that he would not be kept as a prisoner, and would be able to come and go as he wished. Bennelong stayed friendly with the new settlers, and even gave Phillip the Aboriginal name "Wolawaree". He learned to speak English.
In 1790, Bennelong asked Phillip to build him a hut on the edge of Sydney Harbour. This became known as Bennelong Point, and is now the site of the Sydney Opera House.
Bennelong and another Aborigine named Yemmerrawanie or Imeerawanyee went with Phillip to England in 1792. They may have met with King George III, but this has not been proved. When they got to England they were quickly made clothes that would have been suitable for a meeting with the King. 
They visited St Paul's Cathedral and the Tower of London. They went on boat trips, swimming and to the theatre. While in London they lived with Henry Waterhouse. When Yemmerrawanie became sick, they were moved to Eltham. They lived at the house of Edward Kent where they were looked after by Mr and Mrs Phillips, and met Lord Sydney.
Yemmerrawanie died from a serious chest infection. Bennelong wanted to go home and the cold and wet weather was making him sick. He returned to Sydney in February 1795 on HMS "Reliance". This was the ship that took surgeon George Bass and the new governor, John Hunter to Australia. Bennelong taught Bass some of his language.
Bennelong arrived back in Sydney on 7 September 1795. He had a respected position in the colony, teaching Governor Hunter about the indigenous people. He was also an important position in Eora political and cultural life. He often took part in local battles, and ceremonies, including the last recorded initiation ceremony in Port Jackson in 1797. By the early 19th century, he was the leader of a 100-strong clan living on the north side of the river, west of Kissing Point in Wallumedagal country.
A letter he wrote in 1796 to Mr and Mrs Phillips is the first written in English by an indigenous Australian. He thanked Mrs Phillips for caring for him in England, and asked for stockings and a handkerchief.
Bennelong's health was probably ruined by drinking alcohol. He died at Kissing Point (now known as Putney, in Sydney's North West) on 3 January 1813. He was buried in the orchard of the brewer James Squire, a great friend to Bennelong and his clan.
On 20 March 2011 Dr Peter Mitchell of Macquarie University said he had found the grave site in the garden of a private house in Putney.
The Sydney Gazette wrote about him after his death. They said "...he was a thorough savage, not to be warped from the form and character that nature gave him...". Some people in Sydney's white society said that Bennelong had given up being an ambassador in his last years. There were increasing problems between the Aborigines and the Europeans as more and more land was cleared and fenced for farming. The settlers were angry that the 'savages' were not willing to give up their country to become useful workers and servants.
When he died, Bennelong's people held a traditional payback battle for which about 200 people gathered. A person on the schooner Henrietta who saw it wrote that spears flew very thick, and about 30 men were wounded.
Colebee's nephew, Nanberry, who died in 1821, was buried with Bennelong at his request. Bidgee Bidgee, who led the Kissing Point clan for 20 years after Bennelong's death, also asked to be buried with Bennelong, but there is no record of his death or where he is buried.

He is a god with six faces. The god Murugan has six shrines in Tamil Nadu, which are known as Arupadaiveedu. In Tamil Nadu, Murugan has continued to be popular with all classes of society right since the Sangam age.

He was a scholar in Tamil literature, and a votary of the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy.
Murugan is the son of Shiva and Parvathi, who has take birth to kill the asuras. The six sites at which Murugan sojourned while leading his armies against Surapadman are Palani, Swamimalai, Thiruparamkundram, Pazhamudirsolai, Thiruthani and Thiruchendur which all are in Tamil Nadu.

A group of us working on medical content tried translating medical content into simple English a while back per here . We made some process as per here however their was concerns that the simplifications were not easy enough. We were wondering if there is some simple English Wikipedians who could help our team define what level of wording we should be trying to achieve. ( · · ) 09:10, 2 May 2013 (UTC)
Is our article Late-2000s financial crisis about the same thing as enwiki's article ? If so, I'd like to add ours to the interwikis in Wikidata. Thanks.
What is the status of Wikidata phase 2 here? Is it okay for us to start using it in infoboxes? -- 07:45, 5 May 2013 (UTC)

Eptalon and I have been discussing this, and we propose the following set of restrictions to keep the influx of nominations in check, and to encourage more reviewing of existing nominations:

I've still not got time to comment in depth on this issue, but I want to make a quick comment for two reasons: firstly, to ensure that this discussion doesn't get archived, and, secondly, to just clarify that we have 'enacted' the 'five hook maximum' rule? If so, I shall start enforcing it as one way of reducing the backlog. 21:22, 8 May 2013 (UTC) 
Hello,
I think we will soon need to look at the "categories" where hooks can be filed. Currently we have
Right now, there are 20 hooks in people, eight each in Literature and Others, four each in Music and Animals, three in Drugs and one in Engineering.I know its too early to comment, as the full backlog hasn't cleared yet, but the discussion about the categories needs to be undertaken. Personally, I would like to see categories that are equally popular. I am also unhappy about "People". No one is notable for being a person, usually their notability derives from something they did (which can then be classified elsewhere). So, the discussion is open (btw: avoid changing categories before we at least reached some kind of agreement, so that we don't shoot a moving target). -- () 11:33, 9 May 2013 (UTC)

Would you like to add categories related to the year things started? For example, for a company (or sports club, or certain other things) that started in 1968, you would add . There are lots of kinds of things you could check to see if they need this -- companies of all kinds, schools, sports clubs, musical groups and bands, organizations, etc. Certain kinds of things do NOT go in these categories, like television series, so make sure you're looking at things that do go in them. For an example of an article that has an establishment year category, you can look at Dallas Stars.
If the category you need to add doesn't exist yet, add it to the article anyway. Then you could either create the category or just leave it red and I or someone else will find it later. If you do create it, please be sure to set it up the standard way, not by manually putting it into other categories like we do most of the time. Also, these establishment year categories can be created with only one or two entries, which is different from most of our categories. How does that sound? -- () 10:57, 30 May 2013 (UTC)
Everyone, congratulations. We reached a huge milestone: 100,000 articles, the 100,000th of which seems to be Codex Huamantla. Let's continue making the encyclopedia better and bigger! - () 15:27, 29 May 2013 (UTC)

A few years ago someone for some code to make a link on their menubar to the en.wiki version of a page. At the time someone gave some out which I have used for the last couple years but I never felt it worked well because I had to go to a drop down menu to access it so felt interwikis worked better. 
However I have now modified some code from Kumioko on en.wiki that I think works better by putting a tab right on the top of your page. If you want to try it out put the following code in your Vector.js (may work on other skins as well haven't tried).

I have been working on an ambitious project called WikiProject_Medicine. The overall goal of the project is to take the top 80 Wikipedia medical articles and translate them into 80 languages. This project has been ongoing for quite a while.
In addition to this work, I have been asked to take the abstracts of each of the 80 articles and provide a Simplified English version for Simple Wikipedia. We posted a very small handful of simplified articles, but were told by the community that they are not simple enough. At that point, we halted our efforts so that we could regroup.
We are ready to move forward now. However, I think it would be really helpful to have someone well-versed in the Simple Wikipedia community provide a bit of oversight to make sure that we are adding value. If someone would volunteer to speak with my editors before we begin, perhaps we will avoid making common mistakes. We have all read the pages on how to write for Simple Wikipedia. But based on our prior experience, we are a bit nervous to start without a conversation.
Is this the correct place to ask for that type of help? If not, is there someplace else I should be looking or posting? I am very new to Wikipedia so apologies in advance if I've done something wrong!
Thank you! () 23:27, 13 May 2013 (UTC)

I see we are getting a number of unused templates for deletion discussion. We should have under Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Templates a clear rationale under unused criterion #1: "Templates which are not used on this wiki are eligible for QD". We are getting a huge number of template imports, many of which do not improve the wiki, and many of which are done by users with little or no experience of our wiki. A clear QD criterion is needed so that they can be pruned in a straightforward manner. They are not good candidates for discussion, IMO. () 07:46, 31 May 2013 (UTC)
I definitely disagree with changing the criterion, or making a new criterion that allows us to delete templates that are simply not in use. That's way too undisciplined, in my opinion: just because a template is not used does not mean that it's useless. There are many good, useful templates that are not currently being used (conversion and calculation templates, multilingual support templates, infoboxes, etcetera). Surely there is no real requirement for anybody to participate in an RfD for something like ; it can be closed all the same as long as there are no objections. () 11:07, 31 May 2013 (UTC)

Wader

Wader is a common term in ornithology for birds which walk about in shallow water. Sometimes they are called shore-birds. They are members of the order Charadriiformes, which are water birds. The Charadriiformes also includes marine-going seabirds with webbed feet. The evolutionary relationships of these birds are very complicated.
Most waders live in wetland or coastal environments. Many species of Arctic and temperate regions are strongly migratory, but tropical birds are often resident. Some of the Arctic species, such as little stint, are amongst the longest distance migrants, spending the non-breeding season in the southern hemisphere.
Most species eat small invertebrates picked out of mud or exposed soil. Different lengths of bills allow different species to feed in the same habitat without direct competition for food. Many waders have sensitive nerve endings at the end of their bills which let them detect prey hidden in mud or soft soil. Some larger species, especially those adapted to drier habitats, take larger prey like insects and small reptiles.
Many of the smaller species found in coastal habitats are often called "sandpipers". The smallest member of this group is the least sandpiper, small adults of which can weigh as little as 15.5 grams and measure just over 13 cm (5 inches). The largest species is believed to be the Far Eastern curlew, at about 63 cm (25 inches) and 860 grams (1.9 lb), although the beach thick-knee, is the heaviest at about 1 kg (2.2 lb).

James Chilton

James Chilton ( 1556 1620). He was a passenger on "Mayflower" and was the oldest person on the ship.
Chilton was probably in Canterbury, England. "Chilton" is a very old family name in Canterbury. Chilton married and had a total of ten children. Unfortunately many of the children died young. They moved to Sandwich where Moses Fletcher also lived.
The Chiltons did not have the same religious beliefs as the Church of England. They were called Separatists. This religion was not allowed in England. He and his family left England and joined a religious group in Leiden, Holland. 
The Chiltons were not welcome by some people in Leiden. This may have been because of their religion. James and his daughter were attacked by several boys who threw rocks at them. When Chilton tried to speak to the crowd, he was struck in the head by a large cobblestone, and was knocked unconscious.
The Chilton family on the "Mayflower" consisted of James Chilton, the oldest Mayflower passenger, his wife, and their daughter Mary. Two of their daughters were married and stayed in Leiden. Isabella came over later in another ship.
The Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.
William Bradford was also a Mayflower passenger and he kept a journal of life in Plymouth Colony. The journal mentions the Chilton family. He states the Chiltons had another daughter who was married and came to Plymouth Colony later in another ship.
Chilton died on December 18, 1620. His wife died about a month after him during the "first sickness" but his daughters lived a long life. Chilton and his wife are named at the momument at Cole's Hill Burial Ground.
