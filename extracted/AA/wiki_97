Heart of a Dog

Heart of a Dog is a novel by Mikhail Bulgakov. It is a biting satire of the "New Soviet man". It was written in 1925 at the height of the NEP period, when Communism seemed to be weakening in the Soviet Union. 
Its theme is "the [Communist] revolution's misguided attempt to radically transform mankind". It has elements of fantasy and science fiction, and wit and humour. 
The book's publication was at first forbidden in the Soviet Union. It circulated in samizdat until it was officially released in the country in 1987. It is "one of novelist Mikhail Bulgakov's most beloved stories" featuring a stray dog "named Sharik, who takes human form" as a slovenly but self-important New Soviet Man. The dog's internal monologue at the start, grumbling at his life in the city, sets the scene for the novel.
Moscow, 1924.
After a terrible day, a stray dog thinks about his bad luck to live on the streets of Moscow. Then, to his surprise, successful surgeon Filip Filippovich Preobrazhensky arrives and offers the dog a piece of sausage. Overjoyed, the dog follows Filip back to his flat, where he is given a stock dog name, Sharik.
At the house, Sharik gets to know Dr. Preobrazhensky's household, which includes Doctor Bormenthal, Professor's student and protegé and two female servants. Despite the Professor's vocal anti-communism, his frequent medical treatment of the Party leaders makes him untouchable. He refuses to reduce the size of his seven-room flat, and treats the Bolsheviks on the housing committee with contempt. Impressed by his new master, Sharik slips easily into the role of "a gentleman's dog".
After Sharik's health improves, the Professor prepares to operate on him. Sharik is dragged by the scruff of the neck into the lab. There, he is sedated and an operation begins. As Bormenthal assists, the Professor gives him a human pituitary gland and human testicles. 
During the weeks after the operation, the household is stunned as Sharik begins transforming into an incredibly unkempt human. In the aftermath, the Professor and Bormenthal patiently attempt to teach Sharikov basic etiquette. Instead, Sharikov mocks the idea of manners as relics of Tsarism. He insists that it is better to behave, as he puts it, "naturally". As a result, Sharikov curses in front of women, refuses to shave, and dresses like a slob.
Meanwhile, Sharikov turns the Professor's life into a living hell. He is caught attempting to rape one of the female servants. Enraged, Bormenthal beats Sharikov up and forces him to apologize. Infuriated, Sharikov leaves the apartment and remains gone for several days.
Later, Bormenthal begs the Professor for permission to dose Sharikov with arsenic, calling him a man with "the heart of a dog". The Professor is horrified and orders Bormenthal not to "slander the dog". He explains that the human body parts, which came from a drunk, are responsible for all of Sharikov's defects. Bormenthal then suggests that they redo the operation, using the body of a genius. Again the Professor refuses, explaining that the operation was meant to improve the human race. Breaking with his former beliefs, the Professor admits that any peasant woman could give birth to a genius and that eugenics are a waste of time. In conclusion, the Professor refuses to permit Sharikov's murder or to undo the operation, which could easily kill him as well.
Soon after, Sharikov returns, explaining that he has been granted a job by the Soviet State. He now spends his work-day strangling vagrant cats, whose fur is used to imitate that of squirrels. Soon after Sharikov brings home a female co-worker, whom he introduces to the Professor as his new common law wife. 
Instead of giving them their own room, as Sharikov demands, the Professor takes the woman aside and explains that Sharikov is the product of a lab experiment gone horribly wrong. The woman, who had believed that Sharikov was a Red Army veteran wounded during the Russian Civil War, leaves the apartment in tears. Seething with hatred, Sharikov threatens to fire her. Again Bormenthal beats Sharikov up and makes him promise not to do anything of the sort.
The following day, a senior Party official arrives and tells the Professor that Sharikov has denounced him to the secret police, the Cheka. Explaining that nothing is going to happen to him due to the State's distrust of Sharikov, the Party official departs. When Sharikov returns, the Professor and Bormenthal order him to leave the flat permanently. Instead, Sharikov refuses and draws a revolver. Enraged, the Professor and Bormenthal pounce upon him. 
That night, an ominous silence reigns in the flat and the lights are left on for many hours after bedtime. Over the days that follow, the Professor and Bormenthal look far more relaxed than at any time before Sharikov's arrival. Eventually, the police arrive with a search warrant. They demand to see Sharikov. Unintimidated, the Professor orders Bormenthal to summon Sharikov, who is slowly being transformed back into a dog. The Professor explains the change as a natural phenomenon, although it is obvious to the reader that in fact he and Bormenthal have simply performed the reverse operation. The police depart.
In the aftermath, the fully canine Sharik blissfully resumes his status as a gentleman's dog. However, he is soon terrified to see the Professor bringing home a human brain and removing the pituitary gland...

Through the Looking-Glass

Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There is a children's novel by Lewis Carroll. John Tenniel drew the pictures. The book was published by Macmillan in 1871. It is a sequel to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". 
The book is a series of dream-like fantasy episodes. The theme which ties them together is Alice's journey as a pawn from the start of a fantasy game of chess until she reaches the eighth rank and becomes a queen. 
The story is about the strange world Alice discovers when she passes through a looking-glass (mirror) above a fireplace at home. The setting is a game of chess. Well known characters from the book include Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Walrus and the Carpenter, the White Knight, and the Garden of Live Flowers.
Alice meets the White Queen, who is very absent-minded but boasts of her ability to remember future events. Alice and the White Queen advance into the chessboard's fifth rank by crossing over a stream together. At the moment of the crossing, the Queen transforms into a talking Sheep in a small shop. Alice soon finds herself struggling to handle the oars of a small rowboat, where the Sheep annoys her with (seemingly) nonsensical shouting about "crabs" and "feathers". Unknown to Alice, these are standard terms in the jargon of rowing. Thus (for a change) the Queen/Sheep was speaking in a perfectly logical and meaningful way.
The book has several famous nonsense poems, such as "Jabberwocky" and "The Walrus and the Carpenter". and many examples of word play such as puns and made-up words.

Bell hooks

Gloria Jean Watkins (born September 25, 1952), better known by her pen name bell hooks is an award-winning African-American radical feminist writer and speaker. bell hooks takes her name from her great-grandmother Bell Blair Hooks. Her pen name does not use capital letters because the ideas in her writing are more important than the fact that she wrote them. 
She was born in Kentucky and grew up in a working class family. When she was very young, she was in a racially segregated school where she did not learn with white students. Later, she went to a high school that had many white students and teachers. She went to Stanford University, University of Madison-Wisconsin, and University of California, Santa Cruz. In 1976 she started teaching at the University of California. 
In 1978 she published a collection of poems called "And There We Wept: Poems". In 1981 she published her first academic book called "Ain't I a Woman? Black Women and Feminism. "In it, hooks talks about the racism and sexism black women face in the civil rights and feminist movements. hooks started writing "Ain't I a Woman? "when she was 19, and it took her 6 years to write and 8 years to find a publisher. Afterwards, hooks became popular and many wanted to hear her ideas. She is considered an important leftist (anti-capitalism) and postmodern political thinker. 
In 1984, she wrote a book called "Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center. "The main idea focuses on the idea that feminism is about making women equal to men. hooks says this does not make sense, because men are not equal due to things like racism and classism - the divide between rich and poor. hooks talks about feminism that is more inclusive. hooks asks women to understand they are different but still accept each other. This idea of gender relating to race and class is called intersectionality. hooks also says men must do their part in helping to stop the patriarchy. 
hooks has written over 30 books. Her work deals with the idea of a white-supremacist-capitalist-patriarchy. This is the idea that white people rule, capitalism rules, and men rule. By combining them into one term, hooks says they are connected. She also talks about how communities that love are able to overcome these problems. 
hooks also thinks education is important, and has written seven books to help educate children. The most popular is "Happy to Be Nappy."
She has been in several documentaries about politics. "Happy to be Nappy" was made into an award-winning documentary in 2004 called" Happy to be Nappy and Other Stories of Me". In" Give a Damn Again" she talks with Cornel West.

Kalākaua

Kalākaua I (November 16, 1836 - January 20, 1891) was the last king of Hawaii. His full name was David Laamea Kamanakapuu Mahinulani Nalaiaehuokalani Lumialani Kalākaua. He was sometimes called "The Merrie Monarch". He was king from February 12, 1874 until his death on January 20, 1891.
Kalākaua's parents were a high chief and a high chiefess. He had two older siblings and six younger siblings. When he was four, he started school. He became fluent in English and the Hawaiian language. He started studying law at age 16. However, his government positions kept him from completing his legal training. By 1856, Kalākaua was a major on the staff of King Kamehameha IV. He had also led a political organization known as the Young Hawaiians. Kalākaua also served in the Department of the Interior. In 1863, he was appointed postmaster general.
The king before Kalākaua was King Lunalilo. He died on February 3, 1874. Kalākaua was elected to replace him. Kalākaua named his brother, William Pitt Leleiohoku, as his heir.
Kalākaua started his reign with a tour of the Hawaiian islands. This made him more popular. In October 1874, he sent representatives to the United States to negotiate a treaty. In November, Kalākaua went to Washington DC to meet Ulysses S. Grant. An agreement was reached and the treaty was signed on January 30, 1875. The treaty allowed certain Hawaiian goods, mainly sugar and rice, to come into the United States tax-free.
During the early part of Kalākaua's reign, he dismissed many cabinets and appointed new ones. This drew criticism from people who wanted Hawaiian government to be like the United Kingdom's constitutional monarchy. They believed the legislature should control the cabinet ministers rather than the king. This struggle continued throughout Kalākaua's reign.
In 1881, King Kalākaua left Hawaii on a trip around the world. He went to study immigration and to improve foreign relations. He also wanted to study how other rulers ruled. In his absence, his sister and heir, Princess Liliuokalani, ruled as regent. (Prince Leleiohoku, the former heir, had died in 1877.) The King received a royal welcome in San Francisco. In the Empire of Japan, he met with the Meiji Emperor. He continued through Qing Dynasty China, Siam under King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), Burma, British Raj India, Egypt, Italy, Belgium, the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, the French Third Republic, Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and back through the United States. During this trip, he met with many other heads of state, including Pope Leo XIII, Umberto I of Italy, Tewfik, Viceroy of Egypt, William II of Germany, Rama V of Siam, President Chester Arthur, and Victoria of the United Kingdom. In this, he became the first king to travel around the world.
Kalākaua also built ʻIolani Palace. It cost $300,000, an amount unheard of at the time. Many of the furnishings in the palace were ordered by Kalākaua while he was in Europe.
Kalākaua decided to build the Kamehameha Statue. It honored Kamehameha I, the first king of the whole Hawaiian Islands. The original statue was lost when the ship carrying it sank near the Falkland Islands. A replacement was ordered and unveiled by the king in 1883. The original statue was later repaired and sent to Hawaii in 1912. A third statue, erected in 1969, is in the United States Capitol. It is the only statue there that commemorates a native Hawaiian.
King Kalākaua is said to have wanted to build a Polynesian Empire. In 1886, the legislature gave the government $30,000 for the formation of a Polynesian confederation. The King sent representatives to Sāmoa. There Malietoa Laupepa agreed to a confederation between the two kingdoms. This confederation did not last very long, because King Kalākaua lost power the next year to the Bayonet Constitution.
By 1887, some people were very frustrated with Kalākaua. They blamed him for the Kingdom's growing debt. They accused him of being a spendthrift. Some foreigners wanted to force him to abdicate and put his sister Liliuokalani onto the throne. Others wanted to end the monarchy altogether and make the islands part of the United States. The people who wanted to be part of the United States formed a group called the Hawaiian League. In 1887, members of the League armed with guns got together. The King was frightened by this show of force. He offered to transfer his powers to the foreign ministers representing the United States, the United Kingdom, or Portugal. The members of the league instead asked him to sign a new constitution.
This new constitution was nicknamed the Bayonet Constitution. It took away much of the King's executive power. It took away the voting rights of most native Hawaiians. The legislature could override a veto by the King. The King was no longer allowed to take action without approval of the cabinet. The House of Nobles, the house of legislature appointed by the King, was to be elected. Non-Hawaiian citizens could now vote. Robert Wilcox led a counter-revolution to give power back to the king, but it failed.
By 1890, the King was ill. Under the advice of his physician, he went to San Francisco. His health continued to get worse. He died on January 20, 1891 at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. His final words were, "Tell my people I tried."
Kalākaua's remains were sent to Honolulu aboard the American cruiser USS "Charleston". Because he did not have any children, his sister, Liliuokalani, became queen.
King Kalākaua was called "the Merrie Monarch" because he loved the joyful things in life. While he was king, people started to do hula again. (It had been banned by Queen Kaahumanu in 1830.) There is a hula festival named for him, the Merrie Monarch Festival. He also brought back the Hawaiian martial art of Lua, and surfing. He and his brother and sisters were known as the "Royal Fours" for their musical talents. He wrote "Hawaii Ponoi", which is the state song of Hawaii today. Kalākaua strongly supported the ukulele as a Hawaiian instrument.
"Kalākaua Avenue" in Waikiki is named after him. It is the main avenue of Waikiki. It goes from the Ala Wai Canal to Waikiki beach. It continues almost to the Diamond Head crater.

Anniversary

An anniversary is a day on which people remember or celebrate an event that happened on the same date in a past year. The most common example is a birthday, where the birth of a person is celebrated every year on the month and day of which they were born. The first "anniversary" of something is celebrated exactly one year after the initial event occurred. The word was first used for Catholic feasts to commemorate saints.
Other examples of common anniversaries are those of weddings and deaths. Most countries around the world celebrate national anniversaries. These could be the date of independence of the nation or the adoption of a new constitution, or the coronation of a monarch.
There are different Latin names used for anniversaries depending on the number of years that has passed since the initial event. For example, "biennial" means that two years has passed, "decennial" means that ten years has passed, and "centennial" means that 100 years has passed. For example, many countries have held a big celebration in the 100th anniversary of their country.

Wine (bishop)

Wine or Wini ( before 672) was a 7th century Bishop. He was the first Bishop of Winchester. He later became the Bishop of London.
Wine had been ordained in Gaul. In Wessex King Cenwalh of Wessex had grown tired of his current bishop, Agilbert, who apparently did not speak the Anglo-Saxon language. Wine did speak Anglo-Saxon and was invited by Cenwalh to come to Wessex. Cenwalh built a new church at Winchester; dividing his kingdom into two dioceses. There, Wine was the first bishop of Winchester in 660. Agribert took offense at not being consulted and returned to Gaul. King Oswiu of Northumbria appointed a monk named Chad to be bishop to the Northumbrians. He sent Chad to Canterbury to be consecrated Bishop of York. On Chad's arrival in Kent, however, he discovered Archbishop Dusdedit had died. As no successor had yet been appointed, Chad went to Bishop Wine in Wessex to be consecrated. Wine was the only consecrated Bishop in England at the time recognized by the Church at Rome.
Wine was later expelled by Cenwalh and went to King Wulfhere of Mercia. Bede stated that Wine purchased the see (diocese) of London from Wulfhere. Wine remained the Bishop of London until his death. 
Wine died in 671.

<doc id="418772" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=418772" title="Cenwalh of Wessex">
Cenwalh of Wessex

Cenwalh, also spelled Coenwalh ( 672), was a King of Wessex. He reigned from 643 until he was exiled by King Penda of Mercia in 645. Restored to his kingdom in 648 he reigned until his death. He was a pagan king until his exile in East Anglia when, like his father, he became a Christian.
Cenwalh was the son of King Cynegils. When his father died in 643 Cenwalh succeeded him as king of Wessex. He married a sister of Penda of Mercia who was the power in the region at that time. When Cenwalh her (set her aside) in favor of another wife, Penda invaded Wessex. Penda drove Cenwalh into exile in East Anglia. He remained in East Anglia for three years with King Anna of East Anglia. There he learned about Christianity and was baptised. While in exile, Wulfhere, the son of Penda, took a great deal of territory away from Wessex. He gave the Isle of Wight to Aethelwalh, King of Sussex.
Cenwalh was restored to his kingdom . How he was allowed to return is not recorded. Nor is it recorded who ruled Wessex in his absence. But an entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the year 648 seems to indicate it might have been Cuthred, the son of Cwichelm. Cenwalh gave Cuthred three thousand hides of land (300–450 square miles) of land at Ashdown in Berkshire. This may have been most, if not all, of Berkshire. This was much larger than an estate a king might give a family member. Cenwalh seems to have left the Thames river basin as a result of pressure from Mercia. That made Berkshire his northern frontier with Mercia.
When Bishop Birinus died in 650, Cenwalh invited Agilbert, a Frankish monk to come to Wessex as the new bishop of Dorchester. But after some time Cenwalh grew tired of not being able to understand the bishop, who apparently did not speak the Anglo-Saxon language. Cenwalh created a new diocese at Winchester in 660 and made Wine the first bishop. Agilbert took offense at not being consulted and returned to Gaul. Wine was later expelled by Cenwalh and went to King Wulfhere of Mercia. Bede stated that Wine purchased the see (diocese) of London from Wulfhere. This left Wessex without a bishop. Cenwalh sent appeals to Agilbert to return to Wessex. Agilbert turned Cenwalh down saying his current duties as bishop of Paris prevented his return. But he sent his nephew Leutherius in his place. Cenwalh sent Leutherius to Theodore, Archbishop of Canterbury for consecration. Leutherius was welcomed in Wessex as the new bishop of Winchester.
In 652 Cenwalh was fighting at Bradford on Avon. Who he was fighting against is not entirely clear. But the Welsh were there led by Morgan Mwyfawr. At least one chronicle calls it a civil war implying he was also fighting other West Saxons. In 658 he defeated the British at Penselwood. He defeated them a second time at Postbury. By 661 he had regained control over Somerset. But Mercia was constantly pushing into his territory. It was also in 661 that Wulfhere of Mercia controlled all lands north of the Thames including the abbey at Dorchester. This was one reason Cenwalh created the new diocese at Winchester which was further away from Mercian control. Cenwalh's territory in the mid-660s was significantly reduced by the Mercians. Cenwalh died in 672. After his death his widow, Queen Seaxburh, did what she could to hold Wessex together.

Rebecca Nurse

Rebecca Towne Nurse (or Nourse) (February 21, 1621 – July 19, 1692) was a pious 71-year-old grandmother when she was hanged as a witch in Salem Village on July 19, 1692. Her death was the turning point in the Salem Witch Trials. People started to doubt the truthfulness of the girls said to be afflicted and tormented by those arrested and tried for witchcraft. 
Nurse was born in Great Yarmouth, England in 1621. In 1644, her family settled in Salem Village, Massachusetts Bay Colony (now Danvers, Massachusetts). About 1644, she married Francis Nurse, a traymaker. The couple were highly esteemed in the colony because few could work wood into trays, cups, mugs, dishes and other useful objects. They had eight children.
The Nurses and the Putnams of Salem had several disputes over land. On March 23, 1692, a warrant was issued for Rebecca's arrest on suspicion of witchcraft. The Putnams were behind the arrest. Many villagers were angry that she had been accused of witchcraft. She was 70 years old and known to be a very pious woman. 
Her trial began on June 30, 1692. Many testified to her good character. The afflicted girls of the community however testified that she was tormenting them. She was found not guilty of witchcraft. Some wanted her found guilty and urged the judges to reconsider their verdict. They did, and she was found guilty.
She was hanged. Her body was buried near the gallows with others who were hanged for witchcraft. In the night, her relatives dug up her body. They buried it on the family homestead. This homestead is now a landmark. Nurse is a character in Arthur Miller's "The Crucible".

Cwichelm of Wessex

Cwichelm (died circa 636) was the King of the Gewisse, although more commonly called the King of Wessex. He reigned from 626 until his death. He was a pagan king who became a Christian shortly before his death.
Cwichelm was the son of Cynegils, King of Wessex. He ruled jointly with his father. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 614 says Cynegils and Cwichelm fought at a place named Beandun, which cannot be identified. The account went on to say they slew two thousand sixty-five Welsh. Another chronicle entry for 627 (corrected to 626) states an Eomer was sent by "Cwichelm, king of the West Saxons, thinking to stab king Eadwine". It goes on to say Eomer stabbed his thane, Lilla, and a Forthere but only wounding the king. The plot to kill the Northumbrian king failed and the following year Eadwine (Edwin) sent an army to punish Wessex. The next mention of Cwichelm in the chronicle is for the year 628. It states that Cyngils, king of Wessex, and Cwichelm his son 'fought with Penda at Cirencester and came to an agreement with him there'. The agreement seems to have been to give Cirencester to Penda. In 634 Pope Honorius I sent Bishop Birinus to England. When he reached the territory of the Gewisse (Wessex) he found them almost completely pagan. He began to convert the West Saxons to Christianity. In 635 Cynegils was baptized and King Oswald of Northumbria stood as his Godfather. In 636 Cwichelm was baptised at Dorchester. He died later in the same year (636). Although he died before his father, both were succeeded by his brother Cenwalh in 643.
Cwichelm had a son:

A file hosting service is an Internet service that stores files for its users. It allows users to upload files that could then be accessed over the internet from a different computer, tablet, smart phone or other networked device, after a password is provided. The files can possibly also be accessed by other users, depending on the service or what the user prefers.
A variation of this is one-click hosting, which allows users to easily upload one or more files from their hard drives (or from a remote location) on to the one-click host's server. Many web services provide free one-click hosting for image files. This gives the file an accessible URL that can be used to identify it on the internet.

This is a list of sovereign states and territories where English is an official language. That means it is a language used by their governments, churches, mosques, schools and business. In 2014, there were 88 states: 60 sovereign states and 38 non-sovereign states).
Most countries where English is a prominent or official language are former colonies of the British Empire. Notable exceptions include Rwanda, which was a former Belgian colony, and Eritrea, which was an Italian colony where the British Empire controlled it only in World War II and shortly after (19411952).
English is the sole official language of the Commonwealth of Nations and the Commonwealth Games. English is one of the official languages of the United Nations, the European Union and the International Olympic Committee. Although English is not classified as an official language in the United States many states and regions within the U.S. do have English as an official language.
India's linguistic picture is complex. According to the Constitution of India, "Hindi in the Devanagari script" is the official language of the union; and English the 'subsidiary official language'; however, English is mandated (must be used) for the authoritative texts of all federal laws and Supreme Court decisions and (with Hindi) is one of the two languages of the Indian Parliament. English is taught in schools, and the quality and effectiveness of the teaching is extremely varied. English is used almost exclusively for higher education. 
The linguistic makeup of Pakistan is also complex. While the national language is Urdu, English is an official language and used in business, government and law.

Coronary artery bypass surgery

Coronary artery bypass surgery is a type of surgery that relieves chest pain, caused by lack of blood flow, and reduces the risk of death from heart disease. It is also known as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG, pronounced "cabbage") surgery, and known by doctors as heart bypass or bypass surgery. In this surgery, blood vessels from elsewhere in the patient's body are added to the heart vessels to go around blood vessels blocked by fat and get more blood into the heart so it can keep running. This surgery usually happens with the heart stopped, which makes machines that act as lungs and heart needed. However, it is possible to have the surgery with the heart still pumping, called "off-pump" surgery.

Puck (Shakespeare)

Puck is a character in a play called "A Midsummer Night's Dream". This play was written by William Shakespeare. In this play, Puck is a servant to the Fairy King, Oberon. Puck has some amazing abilities. For example, he can travel around the world in 40 minutes. In spite of his abilities, Puck makes a few mistakes in the play that create confusion for the other characters. For example, he puts a love potion into the wrong person's eyes. He also plays tricks. He puts a donkey's head on one character. 
Puck was not Shakespeare's invention. He was a character in folklore called 'pouke'. He was known as early as 1000 AD. He was an evil, dangerous demon. By the time of Geoffrey Chaucer, he had become linked with the Biblical devil. By Shakespeare's day, he was known as Puck, Robin Goodfellow, and Hobgoblin. He was a goblin who made mischief. 
By the time of Shakespeare and other Elizabethan poets, Puck had become a combination of English folklore and English country life. Shakespeare writes that Puck would frighten the village girls, ruin the butter, and lead travelers in the night the wrong way. Mickey Rooney played Puck in a 1935 movie adaptation of Shakespeare's play. 
Shakespeare used a description of Puck from Reginald Scot's "The Discoverie of Witchcraft" (1584). Scot describes Puck with disapproval. He points out that people no longer believe in him. Scot also tells of a man whose head was replaced with the head of a donkey.

Shylock

Shylock is the key character in Shakespeare's 1596 or 1597 play "The Merchant of Venice". He is a Jewish moneylender. 
Shylock agrees to a bond with Antonio, the merchant of Venice. This bond requires Antonio to give a pound of his flesh "next his heart" should the money not be repaid on a certain date. When Antonio fails, Shylock goes to court to get the pound of flesh. Antonio had previously insulted and spat on him in the Rialto (the commercial centre of Venice). This helps to explain why Shylock demanded his "pound of flesh".
Meanwhile, Shylock's daughter Jessica falls in love with Antonio's friend Lorenzo and converts to Christianity. This adds to Shylock's rage. 
Shylock fails in court, and Antonio is released. Shylock is charged with attempted murder. Shylock is then forced to give half of his properties to the country and the other half to Antonio.
Shylock has a famous speech beginning "Hath not a Jew eyes?" Famous actors who have played Shylock include Laurence Olivier.
In Shakespeare's time, no Jews had been "legally" present in England for several hundred years (since Edward I's Edict of Expulsion in 1290). But the idea of Jews as money lenders remained from the Middle Ages. Historically, money lending had been a fairly common occupation among Jews, perhaps because Christians were not allowed to practise usury.

Yeongwol County ( "Yeongwol-gun") is a county in Gangwon Province, South Korea.
It is well known as the place where King Danjong, the sixth king of Joseon Dynasty, was exiled to, when he was forced to abdicate by his uncle, who became Sejo of Joseon. It is also where he is buried after he was murdered in 1457, because he was perceived to be a continuing threat to the rule of his uncle.

Cynegils of Wessex

Cynegils ( 643) was the King of the Gewisse, although more commonly called the King of Wessex. He ruled from 611 to 643. Cynegils was a pagan king but under his rule Wessex started it's conversion to Christianity. Cynegils himself was baptized in 635. 
Cynegils was the grandson of Cutha. He was the son of Ceol of Wessex and probably the nephew of Ceolwulf. He ruled jointly with his son Cwichelm. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the year 614 says Cynegils and Cwichelm fought together at a place named Beandun. The account said they slew two thousand sixty-five Welsh. This was a major victory for the West Saxons. Cynegils had some however during the middle of his reign. His son Cwichelm sent someone to try to kill King Edwin of Northumbria. When Edwin attacked Wessex in five Kings of Wessex were killed. The Northumbrian attack weakened the West Saxon army. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 628 says that Cyngils, king of Wessex, and Cwichelm his son 'fought with Penda at Cirencester and came to an agreement with him there'. The 'agreement' seems to have been to give Cirencester to Penda. So this was a defeat for Cynegils and his son Cwichelm and a permanent loss of Cirencester. 
In 634 Pope Honorius I sent Bishop Birinus to England. When he reached the territory of the Gewisse (Wessex) he found them almost completely pagan. He began to convert the West Saxons to Christianity. In 635 Cynegils was baptized by Birinus and King Oswald of Northumbria stood as his Godfather. This may have been a condition of the marriage between Oswald and Cynegils's daughter, Cyneburh. He gave Bishop Birinus the city of Dorchester and several churches so he could convert the pagans in Wessex. The conversion took some time to complete and several kings who followed were either pagan or converted to Christianity later in their reigns.
Cwichelm, his son, ruling as either co-king or , died in 636. From that time on Cynegils seems to have ruled Wessex by himself until his death in 643. He was succeeded by his son Cenwalh. Cynegils's reign marked the turning point for Wessex from bands of warriors to the beginnings of a united kingdom.
Cynegils had the following children:

Stingy Jack

Stingy Jack is a character in Irish folklore. He was a poor, dirty man who was often drunk. He outsmarted the devil at least three times.
He invited the devil to have a drink with him. Jack did not want to pay for the drink. He persuaded the devil to change himself into a coin. The devil did so, and Jack put the coin in his pocket. There was a silver cross in his pocket that made it impossible for the devil to return to his original shape. Jack eventually allowed the devil to resume his shape, but only after he promised not to bother Jack for a whole year and to not try to claim his soul when he died.
On another occasion, Jack persuaded the devil to climb an apple tree to gather apples. Jack quickly carved crosses into the trunk of the tree, making it impossible for the devil to come down. Jack allowed the devil to come down, but only after he promised not to bother Jack for ten years and not to claim his soul when he died.
On the third occasion, Jack died before the ten-year time limit. God did not want Jack in Heaven, so he was sent to Hell. The devil could not claim his soul, so Jack was sent back into the world. The devil gave him a glowing coal to light his way in the darkness. Jack put the coal into a hollowed-out turnip. He is said to still walk the earth with his lantern, and can be seen around All Saints Day November 1.
Jack became known as "Jack of the lantern". This name was shortened to "Jack-o'-lantern". In the United States, his lantern became a pumpkin rather than a turnip. Pumpkins were common in the U.S. and easier to carve. The story of Jack is little known, perhaps because he was an unsuitable role model for entertaining children.

Jimmy Hoffa

James Riddle "Jimmy" Hoffa (February 14, 1913 – disappeared July 30, 1975) was an American labor union leader and author who served as the President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) union from 1958 until 1971. He vanished in late July 1975, aged 62. 
Hoffa became involved with organized crime. Hoffa was taken to jail in 1967, and sentenced to 13 years. President of the United States Richard Nixon pardoned Hoffa in 1971, but didn't let him join any labor events until 1980. 
Jimmy Hoffa was born in Brazil, Indiana, on February 14, 1913. He was married to Josephine Poszywak from 1936 until his disappearance in 1975. They had two children. 
Hoffa vanished in late July 1975, having last been seen outside the Machus Red Fox, a suburban Detroit restaurant. He was declared legally dead in 1982. His disappearance gave rise to many theories as to what happened to him.
In January 2013, reputed gangster Tony Zerilli offered that Hoffa was originally buried in a shallow grave, with the plan that Hoffa's remains would later be moved to a second location. Zerilli contends, however, that these plans were abandoned, and Hoffa's remains lay in a field in northern Oakland County, not far from the restaurant at which he was last seen. Zerilli, however, denied any responsibility or association with Hoffa's disappearance. 
On June 17, 2013, the Zerilli information led to a property in Oakland Township in northern Oakland county owned by Detroit mob boss Jack Tocco. After three days the FBI called off the dig. 
No human remains were found and the case remains open.

Foreign relations of Bangladesh

The foreign relations of Bangladesh are the Bangladeshi government's policies in its relations with other countries. Since independence in 1971, Bangladesh has officially followed a principle of being friendly with all nations and not being enemies with any. As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Bangladesh has tended to not take sides with major powers. Since the end of the Cold War, the country has pursued better relations with its neighbours. It has strong relations with other Muslim countries. It does not recognise Israel.
Myanmar is Bangladesh's eastern neighbour. Bilateral ties with Myanmar are generally good, but some tensions exist between the two countries. This is due to border disputes and the presence of over 270,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees in Bangladesh from mainly-Buddhist Myanmar. As a result of bilateral discussions, and with the cooperation and assistance of the UNHCR, most of the Rohingya refugees have now returned to Burma. As of 2000, about 22,000 refugees remain in camps in southern Bangladesh.
At the 2008 ASEAN Regional forum summit in Singapore, Bangladesh and Myanmar have pledged to solve their Maritime boundary disputes as quickly as possible especially that a UN deadline in claiming maritime territories will expire in three years time. Both countries discussed the possibility of linking the two countries together in an attempt to boost their trade and commerce relations. The estimate to complete the 25 km highway is three years and at the cost of $20 million. Another aspect of this plan is to connect the highway to the Asian Superhighway which would connect the two countries to China.
The relations between the two are historical, because the English started their conquest of British India from present-day Bengal region of Bangladesh. Today Bangladesh is in the Commonwealth since 1972 and the there is a sizeable Bengali-speakers within the community of Great Britain

Gewisse

The Gewisse Latin: "Gewissæ") were a political group or band of Anglo-Saxons. They originally settled in the upper Thames river valley area. The Gewisse were the most powerful group in what would become the kingdom of Wessex.
The name 'Gewisse' comes from an Old English word for "reliable" or "sure", In the genealogy of King Alfred of Wessex, is a supposed ancestor of Cerdic named Gewis. (also spelled Gwis). The true origin of the name cannot be determined accurately. the name was old in Bede's time. Bede stated the original name for the West Saxons was the Gewisse. The change in name from the Gewisse to the West Saxons seems to have taken place in the latter part of the 7th century. The Gewisse, like the 'Cantwara' (Kent-men) and the 'Meonwara' of Hampshire were political units, not tribes.
In 577 the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle claims the kings of the Gewisse captured Cirencester, Bath and Gloucester. The date is questionable but the Gewisse did hold those territories. The Gewisse found themselves limited in their ability to expand into new territories by the growing power of Mercia. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 628 says that Cyngils and Cwichelm his son 'fought with Penda at Cirencester and came to an agreement with him there'. The 'agreement' meant giving Cirencester to Penda. It was a permanent loss of Cirencester. By the second half of the 7th century Gewisse was expanding towards the Southwest and Devon. At about the same time they lost territory in the Thames valley to Mercia. The change in name to Wessex may have reflected more a change in their territory.
Bishop Birinus began converting the Gewisse to Christianity in 634, In 635 he baptized their king Cynegils who established Birinus at Dorchester. But the Dorchester bishopric was never considered West Saxon by Bede. He considered it to be Gewisse. In 660 Cenwalh created a new diocese at Winchester and made Wine the first bishop. Bede referred to the Winchester diocese as West Saxon. At the time he was writing in the early 8th century, Bede treated the two names as interchangeable. But when writing of the reign of Cynegils he referred to them as "anciently known as the Gewissae."

Ceolwulf of Wessex

Ceolwulf ( ) was the King of the Gewisse, also called the King of Wessex. He ruled from to 611.
Ceolwulf was the grandson of Cynric. He succeeded his brother Ceol. The first mention of him as king in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was in 597. He "continuously fought with success against the Angelcyn and Britons; Picts and Scots." During this time the West Saxons controlled Berkshire and Wiltshire. They also occupied parts of Somerset and Hampshire. Historians question whether he could have attacked the Picts and Scots. The Gewisse (West Saxons) were not known to range that far north into Scotland. The Picts may have reached as far south as Chester. But there is no record of Ceolwulf fighting in Chester. The chronicle records he fought the South Saxons in 607. The Jutes in the South of England would have acknowledged him as their overlord. He would have been fighting against Pybba of Mercia. Ceolwulf died in 611. He was succeeded by Cynegils
Ceolwulf had a son:

Titration

Titration is a type of quantitative chemical analysis. It is used to work out the unknown concentration of a known substance. 
It makes the use of two main chemical apparatus namely, pipette and burette. External indicators like phenolphthalein or methyl orange and internal indicators like KMnO4 (potassium permanganate) are used to mark the end point of titration.
A known concentration and volume of a reagent, called the "titrant" or "titrator", is added to a known volume of another reagent, the "analyte" or "titrand". This is done slowly from a burette until the end point is reached. The volume added before the end point is reached is noted. Because one of the solutions, the titrant, has a known concentration, that of the other, the titrand, can be calculated.
Professionals now use a pH meter, which is potentiometer with an electrode whose potential depends on the amount of H+ ions in the solution. The pH of the solution is measured throughout the titration, more accurately than with an indicator. At the endpoint there is a sudden change in the measured pH.
Since volume measurements play a key role in titration, it is known as "volumetric analysis" as well as "quantitative analysis".

Diderot effect

The Diderot effect is a phenomenon from sociology, which was named after Denis Diderot, who first described it in an essay. In the essay, Diderot talked about a robe he used to wear in the bathroom: The old robe was a little shabby, but useful. When he was given a new robe, the new robe was more shiny, and nicer, but it did not fit well with the other clothes. 
"Regrets on Parting with My Old Dressing Gown": I was absolute master of my old dressing gown,” Diderot writes, “but I have become a slave to my new one … Beware of the contamination of sudden wealth. The poor man may take his ease without thinking of appearances, but the rich man is always under a strain.
So, the Diderot effect describes that people often show a tendency to buy more goods after they bought one item. It is said that they do this to restore the general perception they had about their belongings.

Ocean gyre

A gyre is a large system of ocean currents moving in a circle. Gyres are caused by the Coriolis effect. Because the Earth is rotating, ocean currents in the northern hemisphere tend to move in a clockwise direction and currents in the southern hemisphere in an anti-clockwise direction. The Coriolis force acts most strongly on the wind, and the wind then creates a torque that tends to spin the ocean currents.
The Earth rotates from the west towards the east, and the Coriolis effect becomes more intense toward the poles. Because of this, gyres form strong currents on the western side of oceans, so they are pushed against the eastern coast of continents. The vorticity (the strength of the torque force) is balanced out by frictional surface currents, which normally act against the spin of the water. However, in the middle of the ocean, the effects of friction are very weak.
The term "gyre" can be used to mean any type of vortex in the air or the sea, but it is most used in oceanography for the major ocean current systems.
These are the five largest gyres:
Tropical gyres tend to be mostly east-west with minor north-south extent.
The centre of a subtropical gyre is a high pressure area, which the ocean moves around. The high pressure in the centre is due to the westerly winds on the northern side of the gyre and easterly winds on the southern side of the gyre. These cause frictional surface currents towards the latitude at the centre of the gyre.
Subpolar gyres form at high latitudes (around 60°). The ocean moves around a low pressure area. Surface currents generally move outward from the centre of the system.

The Davy lamp is a safety lamp for use in mines. It was invented in 1815 by Sir Humphry Davy. 
It is a wick lamp with the flame enclosed inside a mesh screen. It was created for use in coal mines, where explosions happened in the presence of methane and other flammable gases. Those gases, called "firedamp" or "minedamp", did not ignite a shielded flame. The wire mesh put flames out.
The lamp also warned the men of carbon dioxide or methane. The flame would burn higher, and with a blue tinge. Modern versions of the lamp are still used to test mine gases, but the light for working is now electric.

Substance abuse

Substance abuse, or drug abuse, happens when a person uses a drug over and over again, in ways that hurt their health. The person is using the drug to change his or her mood or to feel better, not for any healthy reason. Sometimes when the person uses the drug for a long time, they will start to act differently. Some of the drugs are illegal to have or use, or can have certain limits that the person does not follow. Someone who thinks that they need a drug is called an addict.
Substance abuse can have different symptoms in different people. “Drug abuse” is not used in the DSM or ICD. In the DSM, the term “substance abuse” is used instead to mean the misuse of one of ten different types of drugs.  A person can also become dependent on drugs. Repetitive use of a drug can cause dependence as well as tolerance. Tolerance happens when it takes more of a drug to produce the same effect than a previous time.
The term “drug misuse” is sometimes used when the drug being used is a prescription medication that are classified as sedatives (medicines that make someone calm), anxiolytics (medicines that make someone less worried or anxious), analgesics (medicines that reduce pain), or stimulants (medicines that give someone more energy). Someone who abuses there drugs may have to illegally buy them from someone who gets them from a doctor.
Not everyone agrees on the definition of substance abuse. Different countries have different rules for what is a drug and what drugs are illegal. People also do not agree about what is abuse. In most Western countries, one glass of wine is acceptable, but drinking more than one bottle at once is abuse. To some people, any drinking can be seen as abuse. In the United States, any use of marijuana is illegal, except in a few states where marijuana can be given by a doctor.
In many cases, when a person is using drugs, their thinking and behaviors change. Sometimes, they commit crimes while using drugs. They may do things that are not safe, like drive a car while drunk. When people abuse drugs over a longer time, their personalities often change as well. The people who abuse drugs are often addicted. Since many of these drugs are illegal, very often drug abusers have problems with the law.
There are two major ideas about why people abuse drugs. One is that a person’s genes cause them to be likely to become dependent on drugs. In this case, the drug abuse is learned from someone else, usually a family member or friend. The other major idea is that drug use is a habit that becomes harmful. In this case, if a person becomes addicted, they begin to abuse the drug.
People abuse drugs in many different ways, including:
Some of the most commonly abused "illegal drugs" are:
Some of the most commonly abused "legal drugs and medicines" are:
People who abuse drugs have a high rate of suicide. This is because of the changes in the brain caused by drugs, both when they are being used and the changes they cause over time. Another cause is the loss of family and friends because of the drug abuse. In the United States, about 30% of all people who perform suicide have abused alcohol at some point.
This table explains more about how some commonly abused drugs relate to depression and suicide:
Treatment of substance abuse can include both therapy and medicine. Therapy for substance abuse helps people not use drugs when they feel they need to. For children and young adults, both the child and the family may have therapy. The child will learn how to not abuse, and the family will learn how to help the child. The organization Alcoholics Anonymous helps people with alcohol abuse.
For some kinds of substance abuse, medicine can be used to help. Some of these medicines, such as methadone, stop the drug from working in the brain. Other medicines can cause people to feel ill if they use the substance that they abuse.
Many substances can cause withdrawal. Withdrawal is a group of things that happen when someone who regularly takes a drug stops using that drug. For someone to have withdrawal, they must be addicted to the drug. Different drugs cause different things to happen during withdrawal. They can also cause different amounts of trouble for the person in withdrawal. Withdrawal for some drugs, like heroin and other opiates, can be dangerous and should be done with someone taking care of the person in withdrawal.
About 9% of Americans have a substance abuse issue. Young people are the most likely to experiment with and abuse drugs. Drug abuse affects about 5% of adolescents. More men than women have substance abuse disorder, though women are more likely to have an issue with abusing prescription medication. Children who have parents with substance abuse issues are more likely to have a substance abuse issue when they grow up.
Certain groups of people are more likely to develop substance abuse issues. One group is immigrants or other people who have left their home country. They often have issues in their new country, and some use drugs as a way to feel better.  Another group that is at risk is homeless children. They will use drugs to become closer to each other. A third group that is at risk is musicians. They may use stimulants to make themselves more active and happy. Singers can also hurt themselves if they use drugs that are inhaled.
The first official definition for substance abuse was made in 1932 by the American Psychiatric Association. This definition was only used for when the substance was illegal and not being used as medicine. In 1966, the American Medical Association defined abuse as the drug being given by someone to themselves without a doctor.
The first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) had drug abuse as a symptom of other psychological issues. In the third edition, substance abuse was made its own issue. The DSM also has drug abuse as a different issue than drug dependence, which is defined as compulsive use of a drug.
Most countries have laws that make having or using certain drugs illegal. The rules for these drugs can be different between countries or in different parts of the same country. Many drugs that are illegal in several places are sold to make money for groups known as drug cartels.
Drug abuse can also cause issues in a country’s economy. According to the European Union, about 2.5 billion dollars are lost each year because of people abusing drugs. This loss comes from people not going to work or having to go to the hospital because of side effects of the drug. In the United Kingdom, about 29 billion dollars a year are lost. This number does not include the cost of police or other law enforcement. In the United States, the cost was 181 billion dollars in 2002. This number includes costs because of health issues, loss of work, law enforcement, and welfare programs.

Lorde

Ella Marija Lani Yellich-O'Connor (born 7 November 1996), known by her stage name Lorde, is a New Zealand singer-songwriter. She was signed to Universal Music at the age of 13. Lorde's first album Pure Heroine was released in September 2013.
Her first single, "Royals", was released on Republic on 8 March 2013. It reached number one on the US "Billboard" Hot 100, in Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand and number two in Australia. It made her the first solo artist from New Zealand to have a number one in the US. "Royals" also made her the youngest person (age 16) to have a US number one in 26 years. A controversial article on Feministing by Veronica Bayetti Flores described the song 'deeply racist'. Music and culture critic Ed Hightower has offered an appraisal of Lorde's song that rejects Flores' accusation. The song has been covered by Pixie Lott, Neon Jungle, and Mutya Keisha Siobhan.
Her second single "Tennis Court" did not reach the Hot 100. It was a number one in NZ in its first week of release. It made her the first New Zealand artist to have four songs in the top 20 at once.
Her third single "Team" was leaked and then released on 13 September in the US. It reached number 6 on the Hot 100 and number 3 in the NZ top 40. It is one of the songs on "Pure Heroine" that Lorde wrote on her own.
She has released three other promo singles, "Bravado", "Buzzcut Season", and "Ribs". "Million Dollar Bills", "Swingin' Party", and "The Love Club" have also charted.
Her first album "Pure Heroine" was released by Universal Music on 30 September 2013 in the US. Virgin Records released it in the UK in October. It got good reviews from music critics. It reached number one in the iTunes chart in Canada, Australia, the US, and New Zealand. The album was co-written and produced by Joel Little.
She released her first EP, "Love Club", online for free in November 2012. It debuted at number two in Australia and New Zealand and reached twenty-three on the US Billboard 200. It contains 5 songs. The US iTunes version contains "Swingin' Party" as track 2 instead of "Royals". The NZ iTunes version has a bonus track, "Bravado" (Fffrrannno Remix).
Her second EP Tennis Court was released July 22 on Virgin.
Her cover of "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" by Tears for Fears was in the soundtrack. It reached number fourteen in the NZ chart.
In November 2013, she signed with Songs Music to have the rights to her songs. This made her a millionaire. Lorde writes most of her songs with Joe Little, so she owns 50% of the copyright to her songs.
Lorde released a new single on December 13, 2013, called "No Better". It was later included on the extended edition of "Pure Heroine".
In January 2014, the song "Team" had reached the top ten of the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart.
On March 3, 2014, Lorde started a tour in the United States.
Lorde was nominated for four Grammy Awards in December 2013. The nominations were Song of the Year, Record of the Year, Best Pop Solo Performance and Best Pop Vocal Album. She was the youngest person to ever be nominated for Record of the Year. She performed "Royals" at the awards ceremony.
Lorde was born in Takapuna, Auckland. She is a sex positive feminist. In an interview with Huffington Post she said, "I've seen people compare me to just about every female slightly alt[ernative] female musician because people feel the need to put females with other females, which I guess I understand, but I think I'm different because my music is accessible, but it's also smart and those are two things that don't often go together musically."
She was a student at Takapuna Grammar School. Her boyfriend is James Lowe.

Britons (Celtic people)

The Britons (also called Brythons) were the people who spoke a Celtic language known as Common Brittonic. They lived in Great Britain during the Iron Age, Roman Britain and the Sub-Roman period following the Romans leaving Britain. After the Anglo-Saxons arrived many of the Britons were absorbed into the new culture and became English. Others withdrew into Wales, Cornwall and southern Scotland. Still others left Britain for Brittany.
In about 330 BC, Pytheas, a Greek explorer began a voyage in which he discovered the British Isles. In 326 BC he landed and gave the island the name Prettanike or Brettainiai. The name became Britain.
When the Romans conquered Britain in 43 AD, they called the people living there "Brittanni" (also spelled "Britanni"). They were also aware of their tribal .

Monks writing in the 4th and 5th centuries also called them "Britanni". Some used the term "Britto".
The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle contains an account of the land and the people of Britain. ""The island of Britain is eight hundred miles long and two hundred miles broad: and here are in the island five peoples: English, Brito-Welsh, Scottish, , and Book-Latin."

Mockbuster

A mockbuster (also called a knockbuster or a drafting opportunity) is a movie made to take advantage of the publicity of a similar major movie. These types of movies are often made on a low budget. They are made to be released direct-to-video at the same time that the original movie is released in theaters or on video.
Mockbusters are often made to make customers mistakenly buy the movie instead of the one that they wanted. For example, someone may think that they are buying "Transformers", but they are actually buying "Transmorphers", a mockbuster that was released in 2007. Because of this, a mockbuster will often use a title similar to the original movie.
Many mockbusters are made in a different country than the one that the original movie was made in. There are many Turkish, Italian, German, French and Brazilian versions of American movies, as well as sequels that were not made by the people who made the original movie.

Ceol was the grandson of Cynric. He was also the brother of Ceolwulf. He was underking to his uncle Ceawlin, king of the Gewisse. In 592 Ceawlin was driven out of power. This was the result of losing in a battle at Woddesbeorg (or Wodnesbeorg). The chronicle says there was a great slaughter, presumably this was among the Gewisse (West Saxons). If the story in the chronicle is correct the older king Ceawlin was removed from his throne by his nephew, Ceol. In 593 Ceawlin, along with a Cwichelm and a Crida (both otherwise unknown) died. Ceol ruled until 577 when he was succeeded by his brother Ceolwulf. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not say when he died. But he either died in 577 or shortly afterwards.

<doc id="419339" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=419339" title="The Million Second Quiz">
The Million Second Quiz

The Million Second Quiz is an American television game show. It aired on NBC from September 9 to September 19, 2013. It follows a group of contestants who compete for up to $2 million in a game show that lasts for 1,000,000 seconds (or 11 days, 13 hours, 46 minutes, and 40 seconds). NBC aired the show for one hour each day (except for Sunday the 15th, and the final episode was two hours), while the rest of the show aired on the "Million Dollar Quiz" internet application and NBC.com. It is hosted by Ryan Seacrest.
The show takes place in a large hourglass-shaped structure in Midtown Manhattan near the Lincoln Tunnel. Contestants play for 24 hours a day for 1,000,000 seconds, or around eleven and a half days. At any given time, a contestant is sitting in the "Money Chair" and earning money, while defending his/her position in the chair in bouts against another contestant. Contestants earn $10 a second they are in the chair, even when bouts are not being played and during commercial breaks. Only the four contestants with the highest amount of money keep their winnings when the million seconds are up.
Each bout lasts for a set amount of seconds. All questions are multiple choice with four possible answers. Contestants use keypads to lock in their answers. The players cannot see each other's answers. They have five seconds to do so when the question is asked.
During the episodes that are seen on television, there are three bouts: the "Challenger" bout (300 seconds, or 5 minutes), the "Line Jumper" bout (300 seconds in the first episode, 400 seconds, or 6 minutes 40 seconds, from the second episode on), and the Winner's Defense" bout (400 seconds in the first through ninth episodes, 500 seconds, or 8 minutes 20 seconds, in the 10th episode). Questions start at one point each. Every 100 seconds, the value of the questions increase by one point.
At any time, a contestant may choose to "double" instead of answering the question. If the contestant does so, the question's value is doubled, and the opponent has to either answer the question or "double back", which quadruples the point value and forces the person who the question was given to to answer. If a doubled or doubled-back contestant answers incorrectly or does not answer in five seconds, the opponent gets the points. Contestants can choose to double as often as they want during a bout.
At the end of a bout, the contestant with the higher score wins and either stays in the "Money Chair" or replaces the current contestant in it. If both contestants have the same amount of points at the end of a bout, a question is asked, and the contestant who answers correctly first wins the bout. If both contestants answer incorrectly, the contestant with the higher amount of money wins.
The "Challenger" bout has a contestant who has successfully gone through an on-site tryout process. The "Line Jumper" bout has a contestant who has gotten a high enough score on the "Million Second Quiz" internet application, allowing them to skip the tryout and go on the show.
The four contestants with the most amount of money live in the "Winners' Row". This is a living area that is set up next to the hourglass. They are at risk of being replaced if another contestant gets a higher score than them. During a "Winner's Defense" bout, the current "Power Player" (the contestant who had the highest amount of correct answers playing along in "Winners' Row" that day) chooses one of the four "Winners' Row" contestants, who can be him/herself, to play against the contestant who is currently in the "Money Chair". The winner gets all of the loser's winnings in addition to their own winnings, while the loser is out of the game.
Bouts that are not shown on television last for 500 seconds. Every question is worth one point. Contestants cannot double in these bouts. Four bouts are played in an hour; with a five-minute pause after each of the first three. The fourth bout is followed by an 11-minute break. During this time, a contestant may eat, drink, or use the bathroom. Contestants earn money during the five-minute pauses, but not during the 11-minute break.
After 1,000,000 seconds, the four contestants with the most amount of money keep all of the winnings they have earned. They face in a series of three bouts, which are as follows:
The winner of the third bout wins $2,000,000.

C major

C major is a major scale based on C, which is made up of the pitches C,D,E,F,G,A,B. Its key signature has no flats or sharps (see below: Scales and keys).
Its relative minor is A minor, and its parallel minor is C minor. A scale in both C major and A minor can be played on a piano or other keyboard instrument using only the white keys.
Most of the time key signatures were cancelled whenever the new key signature had fewer sharps or flats than the old key signature, in modern popular music, this is only done when C major or A minor replace another key.

Geoffroi de Charny

Geoffroi de Charny ( 1300 – 19 September 1356) was the Lord of Lirey, a French knight and a writer. Sir Geoffroi was born of an important French family. Throughout his life he fought many battles for France. He fought in the Crusades and many times throughout the war with England. He was always loyal to his King, Jean II, King of France and died at the Battle of Poitiers protecting him. Throughout his lifetime he was well known and well respected by both the French and the English kings and nobles. At Poitiers he was chosen to carry the Oriflamme into battle. The Oriflamme was the Kings banner and this was a great honor given to a knight by the King. He was also one of the Knights chosen to fight close to and protect the King. De Charny was said to be a "true and perfect Knight".
Jean de Joinville was de Charny's grandfather's. He was a close friend of King Louis IX and author of his biography. In the same tradition, Sir Geoffroi wrote three books in his time. His most famous book was "A Knight's Own Book of Chivalry". In this book he shared his great skill and knowledge of combat. The second book written by de Charny is entitled, "Requests (or Questions) for jousting tournaments and war". It was written about 1352 to the Knights of the Order of the Star which Sir Geoffroi founded. This book was written in the form of questions. His third book was the book "Charny", describes the life of a knight and lists the qualities a good knight must possess.
Charny fought in Flanders and Tournay. He was taken prisoner but was ransomed because the King considered him so important. He fought in many major battles during the Hundred Years' War such as the battles of Calais, Crecy and Poitiers.
Sir John Chandos was a close friend and biographer of Edward, the Black Prince, the eldest son of King Edward III of England. Chandos was a famous knight himself. He was an educated man and wrote down the events of a great meeting of both sides before the Battle of Poitiers. He wrote that at that meeting Sir Geoffroi tried to avoid a great bloodshed by proposing a smaller battle where 100 knights on each side would do battle with each other and the outcome would decide the battle. Chandos writes that Charny was trying to find an honorable solution to avoid a great many more deaths. The Black Prince refused that offer. Charny’s predictions turned out to be true and indeed a great many nobles on both sides lost their life that day, including de Charny himself.
Charny died at the Battle of Poitiers while protecting the King.
Historical records seem to indicate that a shroud bearing an image of a crucified man (represented in the Pilgrim Badge shown here) existed in the small town of Lirey in France around the years 1353 to 1357 in the possession of Geoffroi de Charny. The cloth itself is controversial. Some believe it is a fake, while others believe the shroud to be the true burial cloth of Jesus Christ.

Harrow (tool)

A harrow is a farm tool. It is an implement for breaking up and smoothing out the surface of the soil. In this way it is different from a plow, which cuts deeper into the soil. A plow also lifts up the soil and tips it over, but a harrow works mostly by cutting into the soil and breaking it up. Harrowing is often carried out on fields to follow the rough surface left by plowing. 
The purpose of this harrowing is generally to break up clods (lumps of soil) and to provide a finer finish, a good tilth or soil structure that is good for planting seeds. It may also be used to remove weeds and to cover up seed after sowing. 
Harrows differ from cultivators in that they disturb the whole surface of the soil, instead of disturbing only narrow trails that avoid crop rows (to kill weeds).
There are four general types of harrows: disc harrow, tine harrow, chain harrow and chain disk harrows. Harrows were originally pulled by draft animals, such as horses, mules, or oxen, or in some times and places by people. In modern practice they are almost always pulled by tractors, either from a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch.
Harrows may be of several types and weights, depending on their purpose. They almost always consist of a rigid frame that holds discs, teeth, linked chains, or other means of moving soil—but tine and chain harrows are often only supported by a bar at the front of the set.
Depending on the type of soil and the crop being planted, one or more types of harrows may be used to get the soil ready for planting. If the soil is very light so that it might easily be wind-blown, a roller can be used at the end to settle it.
A "drag" is a name for a heavy harrow, often a chain type.

Ceawlin of Wessex

Ceawlin (also spelled Ceaulin and Caelin) ( 593) was the King of the Gewisse, also called the King of Wessex. He ruled from 560 to 592. He was the second king to be overlord over all the English south of the River Humber. 
Ceawlin was the son of Cynric. He is mentioned as fighting alongside his father against the Bretons at Branbury in 556. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Ceawlin became king of the West Saxons in 560. Bede states Ceawlin was the second king to rule the southern English as overlord. The informal term for a king that ruled over other kings was "". The term comes from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and means 'Britain ruler'. These overkings typically received from other Anglo-Saxon kings in the south.
In 577 Ceawlin, with his son Cuthwine, led the Gewisse against the Britons at 'Deorham' (Dyrham in Gloucestershire). They reportedly killed three kings, Coinmail, Condidan, and Farinmail. Ceawlin and Cuthwine captured Gloucester, Cirencester and Bath. West Saxons then colonized the lower Severn valley. The importance of this victory was that it gave the West Saxons access to the western sea. This also divided the Britons so they could no longer communicate by land. But it was territory later Wessex kings would not be able to hold. In 584 Ceawlin defeated the Britons at Fethanlea (Oxfordshire) but his ally Cutha was killed there.
About 592 Ceawlin fought a battle at Woddesbeorg (or Wodnesbeorg) also called Adam's Grave, east of Devizes in Wiltshire. There was a 'great slaughter' but nothing was said as to who he fought; Britons or Anglo-Saxons. But it was over this loss that Ceawlin was driven out of power. His nephew Ceol replaced him as king in 592. Ceawlin died in 593. At the end of his reign, the Gewisse or West Saxons held the lands of Berkshire, Wiltshire, Hampshire and much of Gloucestershire.

A very small river, the Maye, runs through the town.
Crécy-en-Ponthieu is best known as the site of the Battle of Crécy in 1346, one of the earliest and most important battles of the Hundred Years' War.
Yet there are other significant historical links. One is the Chausee Brunehaut which passed within two miles of the town and is the Roman road from Paris and Amiens to Boulogne, and is still visible and walkable today.
And just to the north of the town, slightly to the west of where the Battle was fought, there was an airfield used in the Second World War.

Lighting

Lighting or illumination is the use of light to achieve a certain effect. Lighting includes the use of both artificial light sources like lamps and light fixtures, as well as natural illumination by capturing daylight. Daylighting (using windows, skylights, or light shelves) is sometimes used as the main source of light during daytime in buildings. This can save energy in place of using artificial lighting, which represents a major component of energy consumption in buildings. Lighting is a major factor in photography, movie making and television studios.

Smith is a member of the Five Colleges group. That means its students can go to classes at four other schools: Mount Holyoke College, Amherst College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
Smith College was started in 1871 using money left by Sophia Smith. She left money in her will to start a women's college after her death. In her will, she said:
When Smith College opened in 1875, it had 14 students and six faculty. By 1915–16, there were 1,724 students and 163 faculty.
The Smith campus covers . It has more than 1,200 varieties of trees and shrubs.

Notre Dame Stadium

Notre Dame Stadium is the home football stadium for the University of Notre Dame. The university's football team are the Fighting Irish. The stadium is located on the university's campus in Notre Dame, Indiana, just north of the city of South Bend. It was opened in 1930. The stadium can seat over 80,000 people.
The stadium opened in 1930. It replaced the old stadium Cartier Field. It cost more than US$750,000 to build. The head coach of the Fighting Irish, Knute Rockne, played an important role in the design of the stadium. The design was based on Michigan Stadium. The stadium originally held 54,000 people. It measured a half-mile (0.8 kilometres) in circumference and stood high. It was built by the Sollitt Construction Company of South Bend. They began building in April 1930, and took six months to build. The Irish played their first game in the new stadium on 4 October 1930. They beat the SMU Mustangs 20–14. The official dedication was on October 11 against Navy.
Over the years, the stadium's seating capacity was gradually increased to 59,075. This was mainly done by making most of the seats smaller. In 1997, 21,000 new seats were added to the stadium, bringing the seating capacity to the present 80,795. Permanent lights were also installed. The lights were paid for by NBC, which has held the exclusive television rights to all home games since 1991.
The playing surface was natural grass throughout the stadium's history until FieldTurf, an advanced artificial surface, was installed before the 2014 football season.
The stadium is known for its view of "Touchdown Jesus" (actually titled "The Word of Life"), a large mural of the resurrected Jesus. The mural is painted on the southern exterior wall of the Hesburgh Library. It is high and wide. It can be seen over the northern end zone of the stadium. The mural was designed by Millard Sheets and was constructed in 1964. It cost US$200,000. It is contains 81 types of stone from 16 countries, and is composed of hundreds of panels which incorporate 6,700 pieces of granite.
In 1997, fans protested the university's plans to add 20,000 seats to the stadium. These seats would have blocked the view of "Touchdown Jesus" from the field. The university then considered limiting seats in the end zone. For aesthetic reasons however, developers went with a larger bowl all the way around. As a result, the view of "Touchdown Jesus" was partially obstructed.

Bukit Timah Nature Reserve

Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, which is situated on Bukit Timah Hill, is the largest of the remaining patches of primary forest in Singapore. Singapore’s original tropical primary rainforest ecosystem makes up half of the reserve. At the summit of the hill, there is a rock showing the height, latitude and longtitude.
BTNR is located just beside the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, separated by the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE). BTNR the only remaining primary forest in Singapore, and covers a total area of 163 hectares, occupying just 0.2% of Singapore's land.
BTNR is easily accessible from Dairy Farm Nature Park, as well as the MacRitchie Reservoir in the neighbouring Central Catchment Nature Reserve. Dairy Farm Nature Reserve is connected to the Yellow Trail via the Dairy Farm Loop, while the MacRitchie Reservoir is connected to BTNR by the Kampong Trail.
In 1825, one of Singapore's first colonial administrators, John Crawfurd, climbed the hill. He commented that the surrounding forest was so dense that sailing to Calcutta was almost as easy as reaching Bukit Timah. In 1843, the access road to the summit was built. 40 years later, BTNR became the first forest reserve in Singapore to be conserved. The reserve has been protected by law since 1939, when the reserve was threatened by nearby granite quarrying at Hindhede Quarry. Till the late 1980s, BTNR was still part of the CCNR. Then, the government decided to build the BKE through the CCNR, thus splitting the CCNR and forming the BTNR. In 1991, the newly formed NParks, which manage Singapore's parks, nature reserves, and roadside trees, conducted a visitor survey. After gathering all the feedback, they began to develop facilities to improve visitors' experience at the reserve. and at the same time, reduce the damage that visitors might cause to the reserve. Over time, trails started to penetrate parts of the forest which were richer in biodiversity, causing plant and animal numbers to decrease. The ground surface was also damaged and soil erosion occurred. As a result, those trails were closed, and the main trails were upgraded.
During the 2 decades that followed the separation of BTNR from CCNR, nature lovers lamented about the separation of biodiversity in the BTNR and CCNR. They said that animals from each nature reserve could not cross over to the other reserve, and wanted a link to connect the two reserves, so as to allow animals to move about from one reserve to the other. In 2005, some nature lovers and government authorities agreed to build a bridge to link the two reserves. The location to build the bridge was confirmed after some debates and feasibility studies, and issues like design, budget, effectiveness, and environmental impact were studied and solved. Work to build the Eco Link began on 30 July 2011 and was completed in the 3rd quarter of 2013. Trees to create a natural environment were planted on the bridge after it was completed.
Being home to more than 840 flowering plants and 500 species of animals, it contains 40% of Singapore's flora and fauna. A common tree there is the Seraya ("Shorea curtisii"), which dominates the forest canopy of BTNR. Rare plants such as the Mock Durian ("Neesia synandra") can also be found there. The Mock Durian, as its name mentions, produces fruit that look like durians, but they are inedible. Forest Praying Mantis and the Singapore Freshwater Crab are some of the rare animals found there. Pangolins, Horsfield's Flying Squirrel, Plaintain Squirrel, Malayan Colugo, also known as the Malayan Flying Lemur, as well as the Giant Forest Ant all live at BTNR. There are also many Long-tailed Macaques, which is the most common monkey in Singapore. Other than that, BTNR also has rich bird and insect life. Cicadas can be heard everywhere. Many species of birds and butterflies can also be spotted there. However, the birds, like the cicada, are more often heard than seen. Some of the birds spotted there are the Greater Racket-tailed Drongo, Asian Fairy Bluebird, Red-crowned Barbet and Emerald Dove. In March 2011, a Dot-Dash Sergeant ("Athyma kanwa"), which is a rare butterfly in Singapore, was spotted along the Red Trail. Some of the other butterflies spotted there include the Common Faun ("Faunis canens"), Common Caerulean ("Jamides celeno") etc. One species of monkey, the crab-eating macaque is common in the park.
BTNR consists of 4 trails, namely the Red Trail, Blue Trail, Green Trail and Yellow Trail. The starting point of all the trails is the same, and at 40m above sea level. There are poles lining the various trails, with the colours of the trail(s) pasted on them.
The Red Trail is the main trail that brings people from the foot of the hill to the summit. To get to the rest of the trails, one has to walk up a part of the Red Trail first. The Green and Yellow Trails are basically detours into the forest, as they will still lead back to the Red Trail when reaching the summit. The 1.2km-long Red Trail, which is made of tarmac, is the one of the two easiest trails to climb. A trip up to the summit takes about 30 minutes while a return trip takes about 25 minutes.
The Blue Trail is the shortest of all trails, and is the second of two easiest trails to climb. The 0.7km-long Blue Trail starts off on the Red Trail itself, before breaking away halfway to lead to the Hindhede Quarry, at a height of 140m. An ascending trip takes about 20 minutes while a trip back to the foot of the hill takes about 18 minutes.
The Green Trail is 1.1km long. An ascend takes 30 minutes while a descend takes 25 minutes.
The Yellow Trail is the toughest of all trails. It surrounds the Jungle Fall Valley. Hikers start by walking up the Red Trail, then walking into the forest. The Yellow Trail cuts into the Jungle Fall Path in the dense forest near the summit, at a height of 150m, and hikers have to descend and ascend many steps along the way. Generally, the trail descends sharply until reaching the Singapore Quarry, before ascending sharply again. When it reaches the Singapore Quarry, it is only 100-110m above sea level. After that, the trail ascends until it joins back the Red Trail. By then, it is almost reaching the summit already. The trail is 1.8km long, and a summit-bound hike takes about 1 hour 10 minutes to 2 hours, while a return trip takes at least 55 minutes or more.
Other than the 4 main trails, there are also other trails that are not part of the main trails. There are a few of this "paths".
BTNR is a popular place for many Singaporeans. Everyday, many people go there to jog, hike, or for a stroll. There is also a 6km long Mountain Biking Trail for mountain bikers to cycle. The mountain biking trail goes around the reserve, going along the green corridor where the old KTM trains used to pass by, then passing by the Singapore Quarry, followed by Dairy Farm Nature Park and the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE), then near Rifle Range Road before back to the carpark where the trail starts.
BTNR is the second ASEAN Heritage Park in Singapore, after Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. BTNR was granted this status on 18 October 2011.
By the 1990s, Singaporeans had started to get interested in nature. Visitor numbers have rose sharply since then, with 88,000 visitors in 1990, and 400,000 just 8 years later.

In the general election against Democratic Farm Labor candidate Ann Wynia and Independence Party candidate Dean Barkley, Grams won a close election to become Minnesota's next US Senator.
Grams ran for re-election in 2000 as the incumbent, losing to Mark Dayton. During the campaign, Grams' wife Christine Gunhus was revealed to have written anonymous disparaging emails about Grams' potential Democratic rival, Mike Ciresi, from her home computer. She received a fine and suspended sentence for violating political advertising regulations.

Agilbert

Agilbert (flourished 650–) was Frankish by birth and educated in Ireland. He became the second Bishop to the West Saxons after Bishop Birinus. Following a disagreement with king Cenwalh of Wessex he returned to Gaul to eventually become the Bishop of Paris.
Agilbert studied in Ireland for several years. In 650 he came to Wessex as a . Cenwalh, the king, was impressed by his background he offered Agilbert the of Dorchester. This was the seat originally given to Bishop Birinus who founded a church at Dorchester on Thames. Birinus had died in 650 and Cenwalh was looking for a replacement. But after some time Cenwalh grew tired of not being able to understand the bishop, who apparently did not speak the Anglo-Saxon language. Cenwalh created a new diocese at Winchester in 660 and made Wine the first bishop. Agribert took offense at not being consulted and left his see.
Agilbert did not leave England immediately but visited Northumbria. 
A controversy had occurred in the Northumbrian church over the date of Easter. The king Oswiu of Northumbria and his son Eahlfrith each backed a different church position. Why Agilbert came to Northumbria at this time or who sent him is not recorded. But kings Osiwu and Cenwalh were friends. They both supported the Roman position that Easter should be celebrated the same throughout the Christian world. A synod was called at Whitby to settle the issue. Bishop Agilbert was the senior there who supported the Roman position. As he did not speak the language well, he asked Wilfrid to speak for him. Their argument was why did only the remote parts of Britain celebrate Easter differently than the remainder of the Christian world? Osiwu made a decision to celebrate Easter with the rest of the Christian churches.
Agilbert wandered in Gaul (later France) for a time before accepting the position of Bishop of Paris. He held that position from for about 12 years. He consecrated Wilfrid as a bishop at Compiègne along with several others. Later Bishop Wine was expelled from Wessex by Cenwalh. This left Wessex without a bishop. Cenwalh sent appeals to Agilbert to return to Wessex. Agilbert turned Cenwalh down saying his current duties as bishop of Paris prevented his return. But he sent his nephew Leutherius in his place. Leutherius was welcomed in Wessex as the new bishop of Winchester. Agilbert died sometime after 679. He was buried at the monastery of Jouarre.

List of road routes in New South Wales

Major roads in New South Wales are organised into many routes. These help drivers to navigate their way between places in the state. Each route is given its own route number. The number consists of a letter] (M, A or B) and a one- or two-digit number. "M" routes are motorways, "A" routes are national routes, and "B" routes are state routes. The route system includes highways, motorways, and other important roads that have not been declared highways.
Route numbers have been allocated to roads in New South Wales since 1955. To supplement the national route number system, three "ring roads" were built in Sydney in 1964. These were numbered 1, 3 and 5. In 1973, a system of numbering freeways was introduced to New South Wales to complement the national routes and ring roads. In 1974, the National Highway network was defined, which in New South Wales included the Hume Highway, Federal Highway, Barton Highway, Sydney-Newcastle Freeway (now Pacific Motorway) and New England Highway. In 1993, Sydney's Metroad system was introduced.
In 2013, the state replaced its entire system of State Routes, National Routes, National Highways and Metroads with a new route numbering system of letters and numbers. The roads no longer uses National Highway shields on any route. This new system of routes are the routes that are listed below.

Fragile X syndrome

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic syndrome that causes a range of intellectual disabilities as well as unusual physical and behavioural characteristics. It is one of the most common causes of autism and mental retardation among boys. Basically, these individuals lack an important gene product.
Fragile X syndrome occurs as a result of a mutation of the "FMR1" gene on the X chromosome. This causes an increase an increase in the number of CGG repeats in the 5' untranslated region of "FMR1". 
In unaffected individuals, the "FMR1" gene contains 5–44 repeats of the CGG codon, most commonly 29 or 30 repeats. Between 45 and 54 repeats is considered a "grey zone". Between 55 and 200 repeats in length is described as a premutation allele. Individuals with fragile X syndrome have a full mutation of the "FMR1" allele, with over 200 repeats of the CGG codon. 
In these individuals with a repeat expansion greater than 200, there is methylation of the CGG repeat expansion and "FMR1" promoter. This silences the "FMR1" gene, and its end-product is not made.

Lubricant

A lubricant is a substance used to reduce friction between moving surfaces. The property of reducing friction is known as "lubricity" (slipperiness).
A good lubricant possesses the following characteristics:
The most often used lubricant is motor oil, which is used in engines of cars and motorcycles.
Sometimes, chemicals are added to normal oil to give it special properties. A lubricant, like motor oil, can also help in reducing heat. Simply put, cooling depends on surface area in contact. So, if something normally has a small surface area, you can put that thing into a bigger pot, and put oil in the pot. This way, oil comes in contact with small surface area of the small object, and transfers that heat to the big surface area of the big vessel. As a rule, liquids can transfer heat better than gases.
In manufacturing, sometimes oil is used to cool the item being made. This also helps in removing metal that was just chipped off. This chipped-off metal normally flows with the oil until it is filtered. Then the oil is reused. The filtered metal chips are normally scrapped.
Sometimes, lubricants are used for hydraulic machines. A hydraulic machine uses the fact that the hydraulic oil cannot be compressed, and performs a simple conversion – it works like a lever.
Some common lubricants are:
Oils can cause pollution, especially water pollution, if released into the open.

It was related to the Brythonic languages spoken by the Britons living to the south. Picts were possibly the of the Caledonians and other tribes that were mentioned by Roman historians. The area of Scotland called gradually merged with the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata. This formed the kingdom of Alba, later known as Scotland. Alba then expanded, absorbing the British kingdom of Strathclyde and Bernician Lothian. By the 11th century the Pictish identity had become a part of the Scottish people.

Owain Glyndŵr

Owain Glyndŵr, (also known as Owain Glyn Dŵr and Owen Glendower), (c. 1355 – c. 1415) was the last person born in Wales to be Prince of Wales. He was prince between 1401 and 1416. He started the Welsh Revolt against Henry IV of England's rule of Wales. In the late 19th century the Young Wales (Cymru Fydd) movement decided that he was the father of Welsh nationalism. Since then he has been seen as a hero by the Welsh. There is a university in Wales that is called Glyndŵr University after him.
Glyndŵr was born into an Anglo-Welsh family in about 1355. His family were reasonably rich and had large properties in the north east of Wales. He was educated in England, and later joined the English army. He took part in an attack on Scotland, and then later went back to Wales. After Richard II was overthrown by Henry IV there was a period of confusion, and Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn took the opportunity to take some of Glyndŵr's lands. Grey was a supporter of Henry IV, while Glyndŵr had supported Richard II.
Glyndŵr sought help from Henry IV to deal with his land being taken, but Henry refused to take action against his supporters. Glyndŵr also failed to supply soldiers to the king for another attack on Scotland. Grey called him a traitor. Glyndŵr decided to take action against Henry IV. He gave himself the title of Prince of Wales in September 1400, and began a series of attacks against Grey and towns along the borders with England. Henry IV sent his army to Wales to fight Glyndŵr and regain control, but it had the opposite effect. It became a widespread rebellion against England.
In April 1401 Glyndŵr's army captured Conwy Castle. The next year, at the Battle of Bryn Glas, also known as the Battle of Pillethl, Glyndŵr defeated the English army, and captured its leader, Edmund Mortimer. By 1404 a French army had landed, and together with the Welsh army they attacked Worcester.
By 1408 the English forces were able to defeat the Welsh, and support for the rebellion collapsed. Glyndŵr still kept up attacks and raids on the English, but this was more of a guerrilla campaign than a full scale revolt. The last mention of Glyndŵr is when the English offered terms if he surrendered in 1416. It is believed that he was already dead.
Owain married Margaret Hanmer (). Her father was Sir David Hanmer. Margaret had five sons and four daughters with Owain. These children were:
All of Owain's sons either died while fighting in war, taken prisoner and died as prisoners, or died with no children of their own. Owain also had children from other women who were not his wife. They were named: David, Gwenllian, Ieuan, and Myfanwy.
After Owain died, most people did not care if the English people ruled the country anymore. During the time of the Tudor's, men from Wales, called Welshmen, started to become more famous in English society.
Many people forgot about how important Owain was until the 1800's, when people started to celebrate his life. The "Young Wales" group made him the symbol of Welsh nationalism. Things that were owned by Owain were found in the National Library of France during this time period. They found his "Great Seal" and letters he had written to French people. A statue of him was made and put at Cardiff City Hall during World War I. Postcards were sold Owain on them. The postcards were sold to make money to help soldiers who were injured in war. 
In 1808, the Royal Navy named a Fifth-rate frigate after Owain. It was called the HMS "Owen Glendower". The boat served in the Gunboat War. It helped take over island of Anholt. During the years 1822 and 1824, the boat was in the West Africa Squadron, where it chased slave ships. It captured two ships. 
Nationally, Owain is as famous as King Arthur. Organizations use his name and drawings of him as their symbols to celebrate Wales as a country and Welsh culture. In the 1980s, a group of people called "Meibion Glyndŵr" burned down vacation homes owned by English people. They used Owain as their logo. In the year 2000, parties were held across Wales to celebrate the 600th anniversary of Owain's revolt. In 1974 and 2008, stamps were made with Owain on them. There is an award that is given every year for arts and writing called the Glyndŵr Award. The band Manic Street Preachers wrote a song about Owain in 2007 called "1404". There are many statues throughout Wales of Owain. 
There is a building at the University of Cape Town, called Glendower Residence, that is named after Owain. It used to be a hotel, and is now where students live.

Principality of Capua

The Principality of Capua ( or "", ) was a state in the south of the Italian Peninsula. It existed from the 9th century to the 11th century. For most of its history, it was independent in practice, but officially under the suzerainty of the Western and Eastern Roman Empires.
Capua was originally a gastaldate within the Principality of Benevento, and then a county within the Principality of Salerno. The rulers of Capua were Lombards until 1058, when it was conquered by Normans.
Old Capua was an ancient Etruscan city. It was the one of the most important cities in southern Italy during the Roman Empire. When the Lombards invaded Italy in the second half of the 6th century, Capua was sacked. Later, it was made a part of the Duchy of Benevento, and ruled by a Lombard official with the title of "gastald". Little is known of this part of its history.
Capua first became a state of its own under Landulf I. In 839, the duke of Benevento, Sicard, was killed by Radelchis, who took the throne for himself. This caused a civil war that divided the country. Sicard's brother Siconulf declared Salerno independent and himself prince of Salerno. Landulf and his sons had also been allies to Sicard, so the gastald declared Capua independent too. In 841, Capua was sacked and completely destroyed by mercenaries hired by Radelchis. In early 849, Landulf's eldest son Lando I asked the Holy Roman Emperor to settle the dispute and end the war. The emperor divided Benevento and Salerno into two separate principalities. Capua was made a county of the Principality of Salerno. Since Old Capua had been destroyed, Lando I had a new city built around a nearby fort in 856. This new city was the Capua that still exists today.
Lando did not submit to Siconulf or Salerno for very long. Capua was invaded by Salerno and Naples in 859, but defeated them. Pando (ruled 861–862) declared Capua independent of Salerno in 862. On his death in the same year, a dispute arose over who should be the next count. Pando's son Pandenulf was deposed by his uncle Landulf II. Landulf was also the bishop of Capua, so he governed both politics and religion in the county. When he died in 879, a civil war started over the throne. The two claimants were Pandenulf, the previous count who had been deposed, and Lando III, another grandson of Landulf I. Salerno allied with Lando III and Benevento with Pandenulf. They both ruled in different parts of the county, and they both made their sons Bishop of Capua. Pandenulf successfully held the throne in Capua during the civil war, until Lando III captured the city in 882.
Lando III and his brother Landenulf I spent their reigns defending Capua against Naples. Their other brother, Atenulf, had joined with Naples against them. By early January 887, Atenulf established himself as the Prince of Capua. He then turned his attention to conquering Benevento.
In 899, Atenulf I defeated Radelchis II and conquered Benevento. He was proclaimed Prince of Benevento in January 900. He united the principalities of Capua and Benevento and declared them to be inseparable. He also introduced a diarchy-style system for the throne. Under this system, the sons and brothers of the prince would have equal status, and would rule alongside the prince. By doing this, Atenulf hoped to prevent future disputes over succession.
Atenulf made his son, Landulf III, co-prince. Together they made alliances with the local Greek states, such as Naples and Gaeta. After Atenulf died, Landulf mostly continued the policies of his father. He is best known for his involvement at the Battle of Garigliano, in which the Fatimid Saracens were defeated. He spent most of his reign after Garigliano trying to weaken the Byzantine authority in Apulia and the Campania. His son, Landulf IV, allied against Salerno. Like his father, he attacked Byzantine territories, but was defeated. Capua was forced to become a vassal of the Byzantine Empire, at least officially.
Under Landulf IV's sons, the union of Capua and Benevento broke down. Although they remained united by law, Pandulf ruled in Capua and Landulf V ruled in Benevento. However, all of the Lombard states in Italy were eventually unified under Pandulf, who was called "Ironhead". The Emperor Otto I gave the Duchy of Spoleto and Camerino to Pandulf in 967. When Landulf V died in 969, Pandulf seized Benevento from his nephew, Pandulf II. He then became Prince of Salerno in 978, when the reigning prince died without any children. Before Pandulf died, he split the country between his sons; Benevento–Capua was given to his eldest son, Landulf VI.
Soon, Benevento and Capua were divided by the Emperor Otto I. Landulf VI kept Capua, while Benevento was given back to his cousin, Landulf V's son Pandulf II. In the 990s, Capua experienced a period of instability. Landenulf II was murdered by his brother Laidulf, who took the throne for himself. When the Emperor Otto III found out, he had Laidulf removed. His replacement was then overthrown by the citizens of Capua. The old dynasty was reinstalled in 1000 under Landulf VII, the second son of Landulf V. He made his brother, Pandulf II of Benevento, regent for his son and heir. Pandulf reigned alongside his nephew as Pandulf III of Capua. Thus, Capua and Benevento were briefly united for the last time.
Capua regained some of its earlier power under Pandulf IV. He was deposed twice between his succession in 1016 and his death in 1050. He was originally an ally of the Byzantines and remained allied with them against all his neighbours until the end. He was constantly in dispute with the church, and with the coastal duchies of Naples, Gaeta and Amalfi. For all this, he was nicknamed the "Wolf of the Abruzzi". He wanted to give Capua a seaport. He deposed the dukes of Naples and Gaeta, and went to war against Guaimar IV, the Prince of Salerno. The Emperor Henry II had him removed and imprisoned, but he eventually won back his throne.
The city became less important under Pandulf's successors. It was eventually taken by the Norman allies of Guaimar IV.
The Norman count Richard of Aversa conquered Capua in 1058. He left the city itself in the control of Landulf VIII for another four years, until 12 May 1062. Richard became an ally of the Popes, but was later excommunicated. His son and successor, Jordan I, captured an area of Papal territory for the principality. He was also excommunicated. When Richard died, his family was very powerful, with strong influence over central Italy.
When Jordan I died in 1091, the Capua's power declined quickly. From 1091 to 1098, the city of Capua itself was controlled by Lando IV. Lando was a Lombard who was put on the throne by the citizens in opposition to the young Richard II. Richard II was only reinstalled with the help of his fellow Normans from Sicily and Apulia. Capua became dependent on Sicily. The princes continued to try and influence papal elections and act as papal protectors. When Jordan II died in 1127, the principality became a target for Roger II of Sicily, who had united Sicily, Apulia and Calabria. For 20 years from 1135 to 1155, Capua and Sicily were at war with each other until Capua was finally annexed into the Kingdom of Sicily.
Below are listed the rulers of Capua from 840 to 1172.
The gastalds (or counts) of Capua were originally vassals of the Dukes of Benevento. In the early 840s, Gastald Landulf I declared independence from Benevento after Salerno had done the same. That caused a civil war in Benevento, which lasted for more than 10 years. At the end of it, Capua was made a vassal of Salerno by the Holy Roman Emperor Louis II. However, this did not last, and by the end of the 9th century Capua was effectively independent.
In 899, the principalities of Benevento and Capua were united by Atenulf I. Until 982, all of the rulers below were Prince of both Capua and Benevento. Atenulf also developed a new system for the throne where fathers would rule with their sons or brothers.
In 982, the principalities were finally separated by Pandulf Ironhead and the Emperor Otto I.
These princes were of the Drengot line.

An actuator is a type of motor that either pushes, pulls, or rotates.
Linear actuators are actuators that move in a straight line. They can be made to move by electricity, or by pushing water or air very hard. When water (or oil or another liquid) is used, it is called hydraulic, and when air is used, it is called pneumatic. Hydraulic systems are used for moving very heavy things, like in cranes, excavators, or bulldozers.

First Battle of the Marne

The First Battle of the Marne was a battle in the First World War. It was fought between the German Empire on one side, and the French and British on the other. The battle ended with a tactical retreat of the German army. It was one of the first signs that the Schlieffen Plan did not work. The battle cost the lives of over one million French and British soldiers. It also cost the lives of over 750,000 soldiers on the German side. The battle was fought from 5 - 12 September 1914. The battle marked the end of the German advance into France. It marked the beginning of trench warfare that World War I became famous for. 
The Schlieffen Plan called for an attack through Belgium. The Germans were to avoid the main French fortifications, on the German frontier. They invaded Belgium on August 3rd 1914. The Germans pushed through the Belgium army with little difficulty. After destroying the main fortifications in Liege and Namur, the German First Army and Second Army under the command of Alexander von Kluck and Karl von Bülow, moved toward Paris. At the Battle of Mons the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) halted the German forces temporarily. They inflicted heavy casualties on the Germans. But the French army and the BEF finally retreated towards the River Marne where they waited for the Germans. With no real opposition the Germans moved as quickly as possible and prepared to face the French and British at the Marne River. 
This was first major battle of what would become the Western Front. The Germans moved to within of Paris. The French government fled the capital for the safety of Bordeaux. The Germans were so close that they could fire their massive railway guns (massive cannons mounted on railroad cars) right into Paris.
During the battle there was not any way to move French troops fast enough to the front. But there was a solution. General Gallieni called for every taxi and driver to report for duty. Paris had about 10,000 taxis but because of the war only had about 7,000 drivers. Gallieni's plan was to move the troops by taxi, which at the time was a very new invention. The taxis moved through the night and day to carry soldiers. The drivers received 0.20 francs (₣) per kilometer. But by September 8, the taxis had only brought about 5,000 soldier from Paris. In a battle with over a million men, 5,000 could not make a great difference. Also, most of the soldiers that came by taxi were held in reserve. 
The German Second Army led by Bülow decided to move south to destroy the French Fifth Army. General Von Kluck did not know about this so he continued to move up and engage the French. With this movement a large gap was created between the two German armies. The British and French counterattacked into the gap and by September 10 the Germans retreated. Paris was saved. 
The Germans retreated forty miles from the Marne. Since their plan had failed they did not know what to do. They had not been trained in trench warfare but their only recourse was to dig in and wait for the allies. Eventually the trenches they dug reached 300 miles in length.

Božidar Boki Milošević

Božidar "Boki" Milošević (born 31 December 1931 in Prokuplje), a renowned Serbian and Yugoslav clarinetist.
He was born in Prokuplje to father Krsta, a farmer (1892–1968), and mother Vidosava, a housewife (1896–1971). After completing primary school in 1947, self-taught, he began playing the clarinet. In 1950 he came to Belgrade, where he started studying the English language at the Faculty of Philology. At the same time, he worked at the National Orchestra of Radio Television Belgrade, which was then led by the famous Vlastimir Pavlović Carevac. Since that year, he has launched into a successful music career. The same 1950 he passed I preparatory class at the School of Music Josip Slavenski in Belgrade, under professor Franjo Partlić, and automatically entered the second grade. He became a member of the sextet Duško Radetić in Radio Belgrade from its founding in 1951.
In 1951 music editor of Radio Belgrade, Djordje Karaklajić, formed the Great National Orchestra RTB and was its principal conductor. He arranged the Yugoslav folk melodies in a serious way. The Orchestra was also conducted by Dušan Skovran, a rector of the Music Academy in Belgrade, and Djura Jakšić, a headmaster of the Music School "Slavenski" in Belgrade.

Isotopes of hydrogen

Hydrogen has three main isotopes; protium (H), deuterium (H) and tritium (H). These isotopes form naturally in nature. Protium and deuterium are stable. Tritium is radioactive and has a half-life of about 12 years. Scientists had created four other hydrogen isotopes (H to H), but these isotopes are very unstable and does not exist naturally.
The main isotopes of hydrogen are unique because they are the only isotopes that has a name. These names are still in use today. Deuterium and tritium sometimes get their own symbols, D and T. However, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry does not like these names very much, even though they are often used. There are other isotopes that had their own names when scientists studied radioactivity. But, their names are no longer used today.
Protium is the most common isotope of hydrogen. It makes up more than 99.98% of all the hydrogen in the universe. It is named "protium" because its nucleus only has one proton. Protium has an atomic mass of 1.00782504(7) u. The symbol for protium is H.
The proton of protium never decayed. So, scientists believe that protium is a stable isotope. New theories of particle physics predict that a proton can decay, but this decay is very slow. Proton is said to have a half-life of 10 years. If proton decay is true, then all other nuclei that are said to be stable are actually only "observationally stable", i.e. they look like they are stable. Until this day, experiments had shown that if proton decay happens, it would have a half-life of 6.6 × 10 years.
Deuterium, or H or sometimes D, is another stable isotope of hydrogen. The isotope has one proton and one neutron. It makes up about 0.0026 – 0.0184% of all atoms of hydrogen on Earth. Deuterium is less in hydrogen gas on Earth and is more in sea water (0.015% or 150 ppm). Deuterium is not radioactive, and it will not harm living things. Deuterium can also form water molecules. Water that has deuterium instead of protium is named heavy water.
Tritium (H) is the most stable radioisotope of hydrogen. That is, of all radioactive isotopes of hydrogen, tritium is the least radioactive. It has a proton and 2 neutrons in its nucleus. Tritium decays through beta minus decay and changes to helium-3. It has a half-life of 12.32 years.
Tritium is formed naturally by the interaction between the gases in the upper atmosphere and cosmic rays. It is also created during nuclear weapons tests. Tritium and deuterium is used in D-T nuclear fusion in stars to give out a lot of energy.

The redback spider is a venomous spider that lives in Australia. The female is larger than the male. The female's body is about 1 centimetre long and the male's body is about 3 millimetres long. The adult female spider is usually black and usually has a red stripe on its back. The female likes to live in warm sheltered places and makes a web to catch insects and other small creatures.
The spider's bite can be very painful and dangerous to people, because it can inject a venom through its fangs. An antivenom injection is available, which can help to restore the health of people who have become very ill after being bitten by the spider.

Alice Liddell

Alice Pleasance Liddell (4 May 1852 – 16 November 1934) was a child friend of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. She inspired his two books "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" (1865) and "Through the Looking-Glass" (1871). Dodgson wrote the two books using the pen name, Lewis Carroll.
Alice was born in Westminster, London, one of ten children of Henry Liddell and his wife Lorina. Her father was Dean of Christ Church college in Oxford. Dodgson was a mathematics don, a Fellow at the college. He was 24 years old when he met Alice on 25 April 1856. He was an expert photographer, and took a number of photographs of her.
Alice and her sisters Edith and Lorina took little trips with Dodgson. They had boating parties and other outdoor adventures. Dodgson told stories on these trips. He started the story of Alice in Wonderland during a boat trip on the Thames on 4 July 1862. In 1864, his trips with the girls were brought to an end by their mother. It is not known why.
Alice grew up a refined young woman. She married Reginald Hargreaves in Westminster Abbey in 1880. The couple lived in a country house in Hampshire. Alice was a very capable person. She managed many servants. She arranged balls and parties. She had three sons. Two were killed in World War I. Her husband never overcame this loss. He died in 1926.
Mrs. Hargreaves sold some of her "Alice" memorabilia through Sotheby's. This sale included the original "Alice" manuscript. It had been the gift of Dodgson. It was bought by an American. It was returned to the United Kingdom during World War II. It now is in the British Museum. Alice died in 1934 in Westerham, Kent. She was cremated and buried in the Hargreaves family plot in Hampshire.

Anthroposophy is a philosophy founded by Rudolf Steiner. The philosophy teaches that through inner development a person can better know the spiritual world.
"Anthropos" is a Greek word that means "human being". "Sophos" means "wise". Steiner believed every human being had the wisdom to understand the mysteries of existence. He left the German Theosophical Society in 1912 trading divine wisdom for human wisdom.
Anthroposophy does not have a rigid set of beliefs. It is said to be a philosophy of freedom. Each person connects to the world through an individual path.
The path to wisdom is based on research. The research leads to knowledge. This is similar to teachings of Thomas Aquinas. Anthroposophy is different in that it pursues knowledge of science, the arts and spirituality all together.
The philosophy also teaches respect of other humans. It encourages support of others in their interest and learning of the spiritual world. To support this, Steiner created The Anthroposophical Society in 1923. It is now called the General Anthroposophical Society. The society has groups and national societies in over 75 countries.

Venom

Venom is a kind of poison used by animals. It is made in an animal's body. It is injected into the body of another animal by a bite or sting. Animals that use venom include some kinds of insects, fish, reptiles, and even mammals.
Some animals use venom to kill another animal that they are going to eat. One animal that does that is the rattlesnake. Some animals use venom to protect themselves. Some animals that do that are bees and ants. Some animals use venom for both of these things.

Soliloquy

A soliloquy is a special kind of speech in a play. In a soliloquy, the character speaks to himself or herself. Other characters of the play are not aware of what is said. That way, the character can share certain thoughts or feelings with the audience. 
There are many famous soliloquies in Shakespeare's plays such as the "To be or not to be" soliloquy in "Hamlet", the "Is this a dagger" and the "Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow" soliloquies in "Macbeth", and the "Bottom's Dream" soliloquy in "A Midsummer Night's Dream". Plays changed towards realism in the 18th century. Soliloquies became less common in plays.

Aurornis

Aurornis is a genus of dinobird from later Jurassic or the Lower Cretaceous. It lived in what is now China. "Aurornis xui" may be the most basal ("primitive") bird species known to date. Aurornis was discovered in 2013. The animal may predate the famous "Archaeopteryx lithographica", the earliest bird, by about 10 million years.
"Aurornis" was described from a sedimentary rock fossil in 2013. The fossil was purchased from a local dealer who said it had been unearthed in Yaoluguo in western Liaoning, China. At first, analysis confirmed it came from the Tiaojishan Formation, which has been dated to the late Jurassic period, about 160 million years ago. The fossil features traces of downy feathers along the animal's tail, chest, and neck. It was only partly prepared at the time of purchase; the feathers were not showing, and the fossil bore no signs of forgery. 
On 7th June 2013 Science (journal) said that Pascal Godefroit, the paleontologist who led the team that described "Aurornis", is uncertain if the fossil material came from Liaoning province's 160-million-year-old Tiaojishan Formation as claimed by the fossil dealer. It may be from the province's 125-million-year-old Yixian Formation, which is known to have produced several ancient bird fossils. The failure to secure rigorous provenance casts doubt on the claim that "Aurornis" is 160 million years old and predates "Archaeopteryx". Godefroit's team will try to confirm the specimen's age by mineralogical and botanical analysis on the shale slab. 
"Aurornis" was roughly the size of a modern pheasant – in length from beak to tail tip. It had claws and a long tail. Its leg bones are similar to those of "Archaeopteryx", but overall its bone structure is more primitive. The absence of larger feathers suggests "A. xui" was unable to fly. If "Aurornis" lived roughly 160 million years ago, this is about ten million years before "Archaeopteryx", which often has been described as the first bird.
A phylogenetic analysis of "Aurornis" published in 2013 found that it belongs in the bird lineage, in a more basal position than "Archaeopteryx". The analysis was based on "almost 1,500 [anatomical] characteristics."
The classification of "A. xui" as a bird is somewhat contentious, however, due to the various differing definitions of the word "bird". Recent discoveries "[emphasize] how grey the dividing line is between birds and [non-avian] dinosaurs", says Paul Barrett of the Natural History Museum, in London. "There's such a gradation in features between them that it's very difficult to tell them apart ... ["Aurornis xui"] is certainly an older member of the bird lineage than "Archaeopteryx", and it's fair to call it a very primitive bird. But what you call a bird comes down to what you call a bird, and a lot of definitions depend on "Archaeopteryx"." Bird evolution specialist Lawrence Witmer called the new analysis compelling, but said it remains difficult to distinguish birds from birdlike dinosaurs: "All of these little feathered species running and flapping around ... were all very similar."
American paleontologist Luis Chiappe said that "A. xui"'s forelimb is too short to be a true bird. It "is very birdlike, but it is not yet a bird," he concluded.

DVD-Audio

DVD-Audio is an audio format similar to the CD. It is commonly claimed to have higher audio quality than the CD. DVD-Audio has not become popular due to the cost and rarity of the players, and because the traditional CD is considered good enough. Tests have shown that the traditional CD already has the highest possible audio quality; it is not possible to go any higher because the traditional CD can reproduce the entire audible frequency range. DVD-Audio does, however, support surround sound, and many DVD-Audio releases are available with surround sound. The traditional CD theoretically supports surround sound too, but, with the exception of DTS and Dolby Surround-encoded CDs, no surround-capable CD player has ever been made, and no surround-formatted CD has ever been released.
DVD-audio supports multiple sample rates, including 44.1 (same as CD), 48 (same as DAT and DVD-Video), 88.2, 96, 176.4, and 192 kHz, with either 16, 20, or 24-bit encoding. Surround sound is supported up to the 96 kHz sample rate; higher sample rates can only be in mono or stereo. DVD-Audio also uses 56-bit encryption on the audio data (DVD-Video uses 40-bit CSS encryption and CD does not use encryption). The 56-bit encryption algorithm is a modified version of DES. DVD-Video content may be present on a DVD-Audio disc to enable compatibility with video-only players. Unlike Super Audio CD, there is no mechanism for compatibility with standard CD players.

Boris Christoff (May 18, 1914 – June 28, 1993) was a Bulgarian singer. He sang in the bass range. Critics thought him to be one of the great acting singers of the 20th century. He sang some 40 roles. His most famous role was Boris Godunov. He also received kudos for his Philip II in Verdi's "Don Carlo", and for his Mephistopheles in Gounod's "Faust". He sang several Wagnerian roles. These included Hagen in "Gotterdammerung" and King Mark in "Tristan und Isolde".
Christoff was born in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. He sang in the Gusla Choir. King Boris of Bulgaria gave him a private stipend to study in Rome. He studied with Riccardo Stracciari. He also studied in Salzburg, Austria. After World War II, Christoff lived in Rome. In 1950, he was hired to sing the title role in "Boris Godunov" at Covent Garden. This became the role he was known for. He sang in the United States. He never sang at the Metropolitan Opera. Problems with his visa made this impossible.

Italian Peninsula

The Italian Peninsula (or Apennine Peninsula; , "Penisola appenninica") is a large peninsula of Southern Europe. It protrudes into the Mediterranean Sea, with the Ionian and Adriatic Seas on the east and the Tyrrhenian Sea on the west. It is located between two larger peninsulas, the Iberian Peninsula and the Balkan Peninsula. Because of the peninsula's shape, it is nicknamed "Lo Stivale" ("The Boot"). Three smaller peninsulas contribute to this characteristic shape, namely Calabria (the "toe"), Salento (the "heel") and Gargano (the "spur").
The peninsula is about long, starting from the Po Valley in the north. The Apennine Mountains cover most of its length. It has mainly a Mediterranean climate, though in the mountainous parts the climate is much cooler.
Since the reign of Roman Emperor Augustus (end of 1st century BC), the northern border of the peninsula has been set on the Alps drainage basin. Geographically, however, its northern end runs from the Magra to the Rubicon rivers, north of the Apennines in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna. This definition does not include the Po Valley or the southern slopes of the Alps.
Nearly all of the peninsula is part of the Italian Republic, apart from San Marino and the Vatican City.

Battle of Reading (871)

The Battle of Reading was fought in 871 at Reading. It was one of a series of battles between invading vikings and the Anglo-Saxons of Wessex. The viking (also called Danish) army was led by Bagsecg and Halfdan Ragnarsson. This was a large combined army. The viking army was attempting to conquer Wessex. The Wessex army was led by king Athelred of Wessex and his brother Alfred. Both the battle and the campaign it was a part of are described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. This account provides the earliest known written record of the existence of the town of Reading. The Vikings had established a camp at Reading. The camp had several natural defenses. It was protected by the Thames and Kennet rivers on two sides, and by a rampart on the western side. Three days after their arrival, a party of Danes rode out towards nearby Englefield. There they met a West Saxon force under the command of Ealdorman Athelwulf. In the Battle of Englefield many of the Danes were killed, and the rest driven back to Reading. Four days later, Athelwulf was joined by the main West Saxon army, led by King Athelred and his brother, Alfred. The entire Saxon force marched on Reading. In the battle that followed the Vikings defeated the Wessex army and it was driven back. Aethelwulf, the ealdorman, was killed in the fighting.

Auditory hallucination

An auditory hallucination is a type of hallucination in which a person thinks they hear sounds, but the sounds are not actually there. In medical terms, it is called a paracusia. A common form involves hearing one or more voices talking. This can be a sign of some psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia or mania. It is very important sign when deciding that a patient has one of these conditions.
People may hear voices without suffering from any specific mental illness. The causes are still being researched. The main cause of auditory hallucinations in psychotic patients is schizophrenia. The underlying problems in these cases may be genetic.
There are three main ways in which the hallucination may form: a person hearing a voice speak thoughts, a person hearing one or more voices arguing, or a person hearing a voice narrating their own actions. There can be other types of auditory hallucinations besides these three. These include hearing music playing inside the mind, usually songs that the person is familiar with. This is usually caused by damage to the brain, hearing loss or epileptic activity. 
The main method of treating auditory hallucinations is antipsychotic medications that affect the body's dopamine metabolism. If the hallucinations are being caused by a mood disorder, then other medications (such as antidepressants or mood stabilizers) are often used together with the antipsychotics. These treatments may stop the hallucinations, but they are not a cure as they do not fix the cause of the problem. Some psychological therapies have been shown to help lower the intensity of the hallucinations and how often they occur.

Many of the dead were boys younger than 16. The sinking affected people from both Germany and Britain: the commander of the German submarine, Günther Prien, was given a medal by Adolf Hitler, and the British quickly built sea walls to stop such a thing happening again.

After each round, one chef is eliminated until one chef is left. The winning chef wins $10,000. In each round, there are two ingredients that the chefs must use along with an inspiration that they must base their dish on. The first ingredient that they must use and the inspiration are shown at the beginning of the round, while the second ingredient is shown in the middle of the round. Sometimes, there will be three ingredients. Each round has a limited amount of time that the chefs must make their dish in. There are 40 minutes for the first round, 50 minutes for the second round, and 60 minutes for the final round. After each round, Ben-Israel tastes and gives his thoughts on each chef's dish, and then eliminates one chef.

Saints Row is a series of video games created by Volition game studios. It features mechanics similar to the "Grand Theft Auto" series. While the first two installments of the game had a serious and dark tone; starting from "Saints Row 2", Volition decided to experiment with dark humor and unrealistical gameplay, ranging from impossible air stunts to the use of septic tanks as a weapon. In "Saints Row the Third", Volition decided to abandon completely the realistical use of physics as well as almost any attempt of portraying a realistic world.
"Saints Row IV" was released in 2013 and modified the gameplay allowing the player to fly and use super powers, rendering the use of cars, planes, and boats, impractical.
"Saints Row Gat out of Hell" was released in 2015 and allows you to play in Hell with the use of super powers again.

Pelagia noctiluca

Pelagia noctiluca is a jellyfish. In Latin, "Pelagia" means "of the sea", "nocti" stands for night and "luca" means light thus "Pelagia noctiluca" can be described as a marine organism with the ability to glow in the dark. 
This species is commonly known as the mauve stinger. It occurs in warm and temperate waters of the world's oceans, including the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea and Atlantic Ocean. It is also found in the Pacific Ocean, with sightings in warm waters off Hawaii, southern California and Mexico. 
It is an offshore species, although sometimes it is washed near the coastlines and may be stranded in great numbers on beaches. The color varies. As well as pink or mauve, it is sometimes shades of golden yellow to tan.
In an unprecedented event on November 21, 2007, a swarm of jellyfish wiped out a 100,000-fish salmon farm in Northern Ireland, causing around £1 million worth of damage.
As its name implies "P. noctiluca" has the ability to bioluminesce, or produce light. Light is given off in the form of flashes when the medusa is stimulated by the turbulence of a ship’s motion or by waves. This flashing is short, and gradually fades.

Provenance

Provenance, from the French "provenir", "to come from", refers to the history of ownership, or the position of a historical object. 
The term was originally used in relation to works of art. It is now used in a wide range of fields, including archaeology, paleontology, archives, manuscripts, printed books, and science and computing. The main reason to trace the provenance of an object is to get evidence of its original production or discovery. This has a special value to help authenticate objects, to prove what they are. Provenance is essentially a matter of documentation.
In archaeology the term provenience is used in related but a subtly different sense to "provenance". Archaeological researchers use "provenience" to refer to the three-dimensional location or find spot of an artifact or feature within an archaeological site, whereas "provenance" covers an object's complete documented history. Ideally, in modern excavations, the provenience or find spot is recorded (even videoed) with great precision, but in older cases only the general site or approximate area may be known, especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded. An object may have both a provenience (where it was found) and a provenance (where it has been since it was found). In some cases, especially where there is an inscription, the provenance may include a history that predates its burial in the ground, as well as its history after rediscovery.

Branle

The branle is an old French dance of the 16th century. Though French in origin, it spread to most of western Europe. Spelling varies greatly: "bransle", "brangle", "brawl", "brawle", "brall"(e), "braul"(e), or (Scot.) "brantle". 
There are few descriptions of the dance steps. It is a sequence dance performed with partners in lines or circles. In John Marston's "The Malcontent" (1604), act 4, scene 2, the character Guerrino describes the steps of a dance called "Beanchaes brawl" (Bianca's branle): t'is but two singles on the left, two on the right, three doubles forward, a trauerse of six round: do this twice, three singles side, galliard tricke of twentie, curranto pace; a figure of eight, three singles broken downe, come vp, meete two doubles, fall backe, and then honour. 
A more detailed and more accessible account is given of the Scots branle by the dance historian Melusine Wood.
The music for the dance was written in 4/4 time. An example, "Music for the Scots' Branle", is given by both Arbeau and Wood.

Ice sheet

An ice sheet is a large mass of glacier ice that covers an area of more than . It may also be called a continental glacier. There are two ice sheets in the world at the moment: in Antarctica and Greenland.
Ice sheets are larger than ice shelves or alpine glaciers. Masses of ice covering less than 50,000 km are called ice caps. The ice in an ice cap usually comes from a series of glaciers that drain into it.
The Antarctic ice sheet is the largest single mass of ice on Earth. It covers an area of almost 14 million km and contains 30 million km of ice. Around 90% of the fresh water on the Earth's surface is held in this ice sheet. If all of it were to melt, it would cause sea levels to rise by 58 metres. The ice sheet first formed in the early Oligocene. It retreated and advanced many times until the Pliocene, when it came to occupy almost all of Antarctica.
The Greenland ice sheet covers about 82% of the surface of Greenland. Satellite images from NASA show that it is melting at a rate of about 239 cubic kilometres (57.3 cubic miles) each year. If all of it melted, it would cause sea levels to rise by 7.2 metres. The ice sheet did not develop at all until the late Pliocene, but apparently developed very quickly. This had the unusual effect of allowing fossils of plants that once grew on present-day Greenland to be much better preserved than with the slowly forming Antarctic ice sheet.

John Davis (sealer)

John Davis (born in 1784 in Surrey) was an American ship captain from New Haven, Connecticut. He is thought to have been the first to land on Antarctica. He is one of four explorers who share this claim. In February 1821 he may have landed a boat at Hughes Bay. The Davis Strait which separates Baffin Bay from the Labrador Sea was named by William Baffin in 1916. He probably named it after John Davis. 
On March 20, 1820, Davis left New Haven, Connecticut for a trip to the Pacific Ocean. He had received news of the discovery of the South Shetland Islands while he was anchored at the Falkland Islands. Learning there were large numbers of seals there, he and another ship captain sailed their vessels to Greenwich Island. But it was too late in the season and other were there before them. So Davis took his ship, named "Cecilia", in search of seals further south. Finding many seals at Low Island he continued southwards. He probably came upon Hughes Bay on the Antarctic Peninsula. His ship's log records he found "a large body of land." He sent a boat to shore to look for seals but found none. He also wrote "I think this southern land to be a continent". He also wrote in the log the latitude was 64°01'S (sixty-four degrees, one minute, south). Davis continued his journey back to Greenwich Island arriving there on 10 February, 1821. He wintered at the Falkland Islands and returned to seal hunting the following season. It remains impossible, however, to prove he was the first to reach Antarctica.

Social drinking is the name for the consumption of alcoholic drinks in a social setting; people who are social drinkers do this with friends. Many cultures frown upon isolating people because they drink alcohol, and because they may have a problem with alcohol dependence. People meet to celebrate an occasion, which also permits them to drink alcohol without being frowned upon.

Star Fox 2 is a cancelled video game that was going to be released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was going to be the second game in the "Star Fox" series and the sequel to "Star Fox". It was going to be released in the summer of 1995. The game was cancelled because the Nintendo 64 was going to be released the following year.
The gameplay of "Star Fox" is very different from the first "Star Fox" game. Instead of going on a path with the same missions each time, the player moves freely on a map screen of the Lylat system. When the player's ships hit an enemy, the screen switches to an action screen with gameplay like the first "Star Fox" game. Once the player completes what they have to do, they are taken back to the map screen to go to another area.
The player's goal is to destroy all of the enemies on the map while defending Corneria (seen in the lower left corner of the map). The player has to stop Corneria's damage level from reaching 100% from enemy attacks.

Oarfish

An oarfish is a kind of very long, flat fish. "Oarfish" is another word for fish in the Regalecidae family. There are four species of oarfish in the world. The giant oarfish ("Regalecus glesne") is the longest bony fish alive in the world today. It can grow up to long.
Oarfish live in the pelagic zone. This means that they live in water that is not near the shore and not near the bottom of the ocean. They live in all temperate and tropical oceans. Oarfish are also very rare. They are usually only seen when a dead one washes onto the shore. When oarfish are sick or dying, they swim up near the surface of the water. This behavior means that oarfish are probably the "sea serpents" in legends.
There are two ideas about why these fish are called "oarfish." One idea is that their bodies look like oars because they are very long and flat. The other idea is that some people used to think that oarfish swam by moving their fins like the oars of a row boat. We now know that this "rowing" idea wrong. The family name "Regalecidae" comes from a word in , which means "royal".

Zombie walk

A zombie walk is a trek made by people costumed as zombies. These people may also act as starving zombies. They pretend to be looking for human brains to eat. Some people create characters for themselves such as zombie brides, clowns, or mad scientists.
These walks are community events. They are sometimes held near Halloween. There are day walks and night walks. People of all ages join the walk. Sometimes professional make up artists help walkers prepare their faces. Variants on the walk format include zombie pub crawls and zombie runs. 
A walk might be held to raise money for a community concern such as local hunger. Sometimes walkers bring packaged and canned foods for the local food bank. Zombie Walks are held around the world. They may attract thousands of zombie walkers. 
In October 2013, the annual New Jersey Zombie Walk had the largest crowd of zombies ever at 9,592. This crowd walked along the Asbury Park boardwalk. This Zombie Walk is in the Guiness World Record.

Integron

An integron is a type of transposon, a mobile genetic element. It is a two-part genetic system found in bacteria, and maybe more widely. It is the way antibiotic resistance is passed on so rapidly. It is found in plasmids and chromosomes. Although the first function discovered was antibiotic resistance, other bacterial functions (traits) can be transferred by integrons.
Transposons are the gene "capture and expression elements" which put the small mobile elements known as gene cassettes in place and make them work. Usually,
each cassette has only a single gene and a specific
recombination site. The cassettes carry the DNA coding (= 'a gene') for antibiotic resistance (for example). Typically, the DNA would code for an enzyme which cleaves (cuts) the antibiotic molecule up.
The first part of an integron is a gene which codes for an enzyme which captures cassettes. The second is a site on the genome where the cassettes are inserted, and a promoter which drives expression of cassette-associated genes. "Integron" describes such structures both when no cassettes are present and when there are integrated cassettes. Cassettes can be inserted at the site, they can be cut out, and they can undergo horizontal gene transfer.

<doc id="421000" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=421000" title="William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke">
William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke

William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1147 – 14 May 1219), sometimes called William, the Marshal or "the Marshal", was an English Knight who served five Kings. He was Regent of England for a time during the childhood of Edward III. In his day he may have been one of the most important persons in the monarchy next to the Royal family itself. He was noted for his superior combat skills, his continuing loyalty to his Kings and his great ability in diplomacy. Marshal began his life as a “landless” knight to become the Earl of Pembroke and one of the wealthiest men in the country.
Shortly after his death in 1219, his oldest son, William Marshal II, commissioned a biography of the life of his father. Though biographers often embellish their subjects, many of the events of William's life stated there are clearly recorded elsewhere in historical records. 
William Marshal’s father, was John Marshal, called John the Marshal. He was the Lord of Newbury Castle located in County Berkshire in England. When William was a young boy, there was a fierce civil war in England between King Stephen, grandson of William I, also called William the Conqueror and Henry I's daughter, Empress Matilda. When William I died, both Stephen and Matilda believed they were the true successor to the Crown. This period in history was known as the time of The Anarchy because there was much lawlessness and violence in the Kingdom. Many barons and Earls would "change sides" when it benefited them to do so and John Marshal was no exception. At first he pledged his fealty or loyalty to King Stephen but later changed it to Empress Matilda. This act helped to turn the tide in the civil war. 
At an early age, William was sent to William de Tancarville to learn the skills of knighthood. He was knighted in 1166. He then crossed the channel to Normandy and went to serve under his uncle, Patrick, the Earl of Salisbury. He fought in Ponthieu in 1168 when greatly outnumbered, his uncle was killed and William was taken prisoner. Marshal's great skill and bravery was noticed and he was ransomed by Queen Eleanor of England. 
As a young adult, Marshal went to many tournaments. These were contests and mock (imitation) wars where Knights competed for great prizes. Tournaments were an opportunity for a knight to acquire valuable possessions such as money, a horse, armor and weapons. They were dangerous and it was not unusual for a knight to be killed during a tournament.
William had become a very skilled knight and after his ramsom he became part of Henry II’s household, teaching men to fight. He became tutor, guardian, protector and friend to the son of Henry II, known historically as Henry the Young King. When young Henry was coronated, Marshal was assigned to serve him as captain of the guard and chief of the knights. It was Marshal who would knight the young King Henry. Marshal also accompanied young Henry on many tournaments. In 1173 young Henry argued with his father. He wanted to assume the throne of England even though his father was still alive. He left England and took his brother Richard with him to his mother's lands in Aquitaine. In 1174, Henry II and his son made peace. William continued on to win fame in tournaments. The young king became ill and died of a sudden disease at Martel on 11 June 1183.
On his deathbed young Henry ordered Marshal to go on Crusade on his behalf. With Henry II's permission, William went on Crusade for two years and his superior fighting skill was recognized by the Knights Templar. When he returned, Henry II at once took him into high favor, and made him a member of his household. Marshal then fought for Henry II against the French King Louis VII of France and in skirmishs against Henry's other sons now in rebellion.
Richard (called Lionhearted) was Henry II’s second son and he also wanted to be King of England and did not want to wait until his father died. After a skirmish, Marshal came upon Richard and instead of killing him, killed his horse. Shortly thereafter, Henry II became ill and retreated to Chinon where he died in 1189.
Richard did not forget Marshal’s act of bravery and loyalty and when he became King, he took Marshal to fight against the King of France. After a time, Richard decided to go on Crusade and left Marshal in England as the Justiciar of England who acted for the king in his absence and presided over the king's courts during his absence.
Richard I reaffirmed his father's promise to William and gave him the heiress of the Earldom of Pembroke, Striguil and the lands that came with her as was promised to him by Henry II shortly before Henry's death. Marshal at once became one of the richest men in the Kingdom. He acquired property in four countries.
Marshal fought valiantly for Richard against the King of France and was there when the peace treaty was made. In 1199 King Richard was wounded and died of his wounds. At that point there was another dispute about who would next be King of England, Arthur or John.
Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, was another son of Henry II and would have been the next in line to be King but he died on either the 19 or 21 August 1186, at the age of 27. The more common version is that he was trampled to death in a jousting tournament. Geoffrey had a son Arthur I, who became the next Duke of Brittany. Arthur felt that he was also heir to the throne of England. Marshal believed that as a brother to King Richard, and in accordance with Norman custom, John, Geoffrey’s brother, should become the next King. It was resolved in John’s favor and he became the next King of England.
William fought alongside King John and after a time, John made William the Marshal of England.
King John was a man who was disliked by many of his barons and Earls. He knew this and distrusted them. When Marshal went over to protect his lands in Ireland the King made him give one of his sons as hostage to make sure that Marshal was not disloyal to him. King John sometimes took lands away from Marshal and at other times gave them back. There was strife all during the reign of King John but Marshal remained loyal to the King throughout.
King John died on 18 October, 1216. At that time his son, Henry III was too young to rule the kingdom. Marshal was appointed as Regent to Henry III to make decisions on Henry’s behalf until he came of age.
Marshal was quite old by then but managed the affairs of Henry III as Regent and even fought in combat at the Battle of Lincoln. He was approximately 70 years of age. On 14 May 1219 Marshal died at Caversham.
When he knew he was dying he took on the robe of a Knights Templar and after his death he was buried in the Temple Church in London. William Marshal’s effigy can still be seen at the Temple Church, London, with his son next to him.

Affinity

In law, affinity is the kinship relationship that exists between two or more people as a result of somebody's marriage. It is different from consanguinity (blood relationship). Affinity is the relationship which each party to a marriage has to the relatives of the other partner to the marriage. But affinity does not cover the marital relationship of the parties to the marriage themselves. 
Under the law, such relatives by marriage are known as affines. More commonly, they are known as , as affinity is usually signified by adding to a degree of kinship.
In law, affinity may be used to prohibit incestuous sexual relations. It may also be relevant in preventing some couples from marrying. Which relationships are prohibited varys from country to country, and from time to time. In some countries, especially in the past, the prohibited relationships were based on religious laws. In earlier laws, affinity was used in the same degrees as consanguinity in prohibiting marriages.
Though laws vary considerably, affinity does not always cease with the death of one of the marriage partners through whom affinity is traced. It does not always end with the divorce of the marriage partners. In addition to kinship by marriage, "affinity" can sometimes also include kinship by adoption and step relationship.

<doc id="421157" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=421157" title="Consanguinity">
Consanguinity

Consanguinity ("blood relation", from the Latin "consanguinitas") means being of the same kinship as another person. Consanguinity also means being descended from the same ancestor as another person. The laws of many jurisdictions set up degrees of consanguinity when prohibiting sexual relations and marriage. Rules of Consanguinity are also used to determine heirs of an estate. These are according to laws that govern intestate succession. These vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
Most cultures have prohibited marriages between individuals who are closely related by blood (consanguinity). There were some exceptions. Brothers and sisters, as well as fathers and daughters, often married in ancient Egypt. These were primarily limited to the royal family from the earliest times. Some theories hold that it strengthened a King's claim to the throne. In biblical history, Abraham married his (half-)sister Sarah.
Most early societies had rules or laws that limited consanguineous marriages. So the dangers of inbreeding must have been known to them. 
In ancient Rome, marriage was governed by civil laws. Under Roman civil law couples were forbidden to marry if they were within four degrees of consanguinity. The Germanic peoples also had rules against such marriages but were not as strict. 
In the 5th century, after the Roman empire collapsed, the church took over regulating marriage. At first they did not have a great deal of influence. The Church's power over marriage grew gradually. At first the Church followed Roman civil law. In the ninth century the church raised the number of prohibited degrees to seven. They also changed the method by which they were calculated. The nobility of Europe usually married from within their own social class. Eventually they became too interrelated to marry by the Church's rules. Many found it necessary to defy the Church. In 1215 the Fourth Lateran Council reduced the number of prohibited degrees of consanguinity from seven back to four. The pope had the power to waive the rules for particular couples. Frequently, papal dispensations were given allowing closely related couples to marry. These were almost always reserved for the royalty and nobility. Sometimes the Church used consanguinity to block marriage as in the case of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders. In 1049 Pope Leo IX refused to allow the marriage. He did not give a reason but the two were cousins. They married anyway. Ten years later, in 1059, Pope, Nicholas II finally granted a dispensation for their marriage. Despite restrictions and laws, up to the 20th century consanguineous marriages were not uncommon in Europe.
The degree of consanguinity can be illustrated with a consanguinity table. Each level of lineal consanguinity ("i.e.", generation or meiosis) appears as a row. Individuals with a collaterally consanguineous relationship share the same row. Consanguinity (blood relationship) is different from Affinity (relationship through marriage) but have been prohibited in the same degrees in the past.

Thomas Schelling

Thomas Crombie Schelling (14 April 1921 – 13 December 2016) was an American economist and professor of foreign affairs, national security, nuclear strategy, and arms control.
After 1953 he left government to join the economics faculty at Yale University, and in 1958 he was appointed Professor of Economics at Harvard University. In 1969 he joined the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
In 1993 Schelling received an award from the National Academy of Sciences. He also received an honorary doctorate from Yale University in 2009 as well as an honorary degree from the University of Manchester.
He was awarded the 2005 Nobel Prize in Economics (shared with Robert Aumann) for "having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis".
Schelling was born on 14 April 1921 in Oakland, California. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, at Harvard University, and at Yale University.
Schelling married Corinne Tigay Saposs in 1947. They had four children. They divorced in 1991. Then, Schelling married Alice M. Coleman in 1991. They had four children.
Schelling died on 13 December 2016 in Bethesda, Maryland from complications following a hip fracture, aged 95.
Schelling's most famous work grew out of the post-war interest in game theory and the Cold War. The book covers an area known as strategic bargaining, about how the United States could deal with the Soviet Union after World War II. It is thought to be one of the hundred books that have been most influential in the West since 1945. Many studies at the RAND Corporation and Herman Kahn's Hudson Institute were along similar lines. All these people knew each other and gave advice and seminars at the Pentagon and other U.S. government departments.
Schelling's theories about war were extended in "Arms and Influence". The blurb states that it "carries forward the analysis so brilliantly begun in his earlier "The Strategy of Conflict"... and makes a significant contribution to the growing literature on modern war and diplomacy". 
In 1969 and 1971, Schelling published widely cited articles dealing with what he called "a general theory of tipping". In these papers he showed that a preference that one's neighbors be of the same color, or even a preference for a mixture "up to some limit", could lead to total segregation. This explained the phenomenon of complete local separation of distinct groups. 
Once a cycle of such changes has begun, it may have a self-sustaining momentum.
Schelling has been involved in the global warming debate since chairing a commission for President Jimmy Carter in 1980. He believes climate change poses a serious threat to developing nations, but that the threat to the United States has been exaggerated. Drawing on his experience with the Marshall Plan after World War II, he has argued that addressing global warming is a bargaining problem; if the world is able to reduce emissions, poor countries will receive most of the benefits but rich countries will bear most of the costs.

Great Heathen Army

The Great Heathen Army, also called the Great Danish Army or The Great Viking Army, was a large force of Danish Vikings that attacked Anglo-Saxon England. This army appeared in East Anglia in 865. Unlike earlier Vikings who made brief raids on England, the Great army stayed for many years in an attempt to conquer all of England. 
The first recorded Viking attack in England was in 793 at Lindisfarne. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reported " the of heathen men miserably destroyed God's church at Lindesfarne." There were many reasons that Vikings began attacking England. The populations of Norway had been growing between the 7th and 9th centuries. The Vikings were pagans who often had several wives and many sons. These young men filled the ranks of armies and joined ship's crews to go on adventures. The beginning of trade between Europe and England had opened up great trading centers. Vikings were traders but at the same time resorted to piracy when it suited them. This was especially true when they found new lands and people who were not well protected. 
The peoples of Norway, Sweden and Denmark were different from each other. The first raiders from the north who set foot in England were from Norway. They sacked and killed monks at Lindisfarne and at Jarrow the following year. The Norwegian Vikings then established colonies in the Shetland and Orkney Islands. They also settled in Ireland. The Vikings from Norway only came back to England in the 10th century and from their settlements in Ireland. The Swedes, called the Rus, were to later expand eastwards into Russia. In 835 there was a raid at the mouth of the River Thames by Danish Vikings. For the next thirty years these attacks on England continued. In 850 Canterbury and London were attacked by a Danish band led by Rorik. He was defeated and killed the next year by Athelwulf of Wessex. Only twice had a Danish army spent the winter in England: in 850 and 854.
In 865 the Danish Vikings changed their tactics. A large army made up of many smaller bands landed in East Anglia. For over a decade they remained in England destroying entire kingdoms as they went. The Danes spent the winter in East Anglia. The local people bought peace with the Vikings by supplying them with horses. After a year they moved northwards to Northumbria now a mounted army. They captured York and defeated two Northumbrian kings, Aella and Osbert, who joined forces to attack the Danes. Both kings were killed. In 867 they appointed a client-king named Ecgberht over the Northumbrians. In the fall of that year they moved south into Mercia. The Danes made their winter camp at Nottingham. In 868 Burgred, the King of Mercia, asked King Ethelred of Wessex and his brother Alfred for their help against the Danes. The Danes did not fight but allowed the Mercians to pay them for peace. 
The Vikings later withdrew to York. The next year, 871, the great Viking army grew much larger. After twelve months in York, the great army moved south again into East Anglia. Setting up winter quarters at Thetford they defeated King Edmund of East Anglia. Next, in the fall of 870 they moved to Reading. Athelred with his brother Alfred arrived with their army to meet the new threat. In the battle that followed, the Battle of Reading, both sides suffered many casualties. Athelred's army was defeated. Four days later the two armies met again at the Battle of Ashdown. This time the West Saxons won the victory and the Vikings retreated to Reading. Two weeks later Athelred and Alfred led the West Saxons against the Danes at Basing where the Danes won. Two months passed without any fighting between them. The next battle was at a place called Merantun. After a day long battle which the English were winning, the Danes were able to regain their lost ground. Just after mid-April in 871, Athelred died. At this point Wessex was the last remaining kingdom that hadn't been destroyed by the Vikings. Within a month, Alfred, who replaced his brother as king, was defeated at Wilton. There were nine more battles between the West Saxons and the Danes in the next year. Wessex finally paid the Vikings for peace which ended the fighting. Alfred remained on the throne. Of the two known leaders of the Danes, Ivar the Boneless disappeared from the records after 871. His brother Halfdan Ragnarsson was still the leader when the Danes withdrew from Wessex to winter in London the same year.
In 872 the Northumbrians rebelled against the Danes and ejected King Ecgberht. They placed King Ricsige on the throne. Ecgberht took refuge in Mercia. The Danes came north to put down the rebellion, but succeeded only in subduing Deira. Within a few weeks the Danes set up their winter camp at Torksey in Mercia. The Danes had operated as a single army for nine years. But in 874 it divided into two armies. They never reunited.
In 874 Halfdan took his followers north to camp at the mouth of the River Tyne. They raided the Picts and Britons in Strathclyde for the next year. But there was little gain in raiding these poorer areas. The Danes had plundered the wealth of most of England and little was left. Halfdan began settling his men in the area of York. The other army led by Gutheram, Oscytel and Arnuld was still fighting against Wessex at the time. By 876 they had concluded a peace with Wessex. In late 878 Guthrum's band withdrew to Cirencester in Mercia. In 879 they moved to East Anglia. The leader Guthrum, known by his Christian name Aethelstan, reigned as king until his death in 890. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle 'they occupied the land and shared it out.' In 878 a new Danish army was camped at Fulham. But by 879 they had left England for the Low Countries.
The settling of a large part of conquered England by the Danes became known as the Danelaw. It became the part of England where the laws and customs were Danish not English. At this point England became divided into three parts. These were Wessex, English Mercia and the Danelaw. The Danelaw was a mixture of the native populations and the members of the great army who settled there. Many placenames were Danish. Many of the words in the English vocabulary have Danish origins. As late as the 11th century when a came to England he did not feel out of place. The languages was the same and the customs were the same. This was true until the Norman conquest of England in 1066 when French was introduced into England.

Nehemiah Grew

Nehemiah Grew (26 September 164125 March 1712) was an English plant anatomist and physiologist, the "Father of Plant Anatomy".
Grew graduated from Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1661, and ten years later took the degree of M.D. at Leiden University. 
He began work on the anatomy of plants in 1664, and in 1670 his essay, "The Anatomy of Vegetables begun", was communicated to the Royal Society. The following year he was elected a Fellow. In 1672, when the essay was published, he settled in London, and soon acquired an extensive practice as a physician. 
In 1673 he published his "Idea of a Phytological History", which consisted of papers he had communicated to the Royal Society in the preceding year, and in 1677 he succeeded Henry Oldenburg as Secretary of the Royal Society. He edited the "Philosophical Transactions" in 1678-1679, and in 1681 he published by request a descriptive catalogue of the rarities preserved at Gresham College.
In 1682 appeared his great work on the "Anatomy of Plants", which also was largely a collection of previous publications. It was illustrated with eighty-two plates, with an appendix of seven papers mostly of a chemical character. The "Anatomy" is especially notable for its descriptions of plant structure. He described nearly all the key differences of morphology of stem and root, showed that the flowers of the Asteraceae are built of multiple units, and correctly said that stamens are male organs. "Anatomy of Plants" also contains the first known microscopic description of pollen.
Much of Grew's pioneering work with the microscope was done at the same time as that of Marcello Malpighi. The two reportedly borrowed freely from one another. Grew's work on pollen was more extensive than that of Malpighi. It led to the discovery that size and shape is different between species, whereas pollen grains within a species are all alike. This discovery is central to the field of micropaleontology.

In the later part of his life he chiefly devoted himself to comparative anatomy. Fishes and marine invertebrates were his favourite subjects. He took 19 trips to the Baltic and North Sea, the Adriatic and the Mediterranean to investigate salt-water life.
He authored a comprehensive work on the anatomy of amphibians, which in his era including reptiles. Also, he described several new species of snakes.
Müller mentored some distinguished physiologists and biologists, including Hermann von Helmholtz, Emil du Bois-Reymond, Theodor Schwann, Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle, Carl Ludwig and Ernst Haeckel. In 1834, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1854.

The Sobolev space is a function space in mathematics. The space is very useful to analyze for partial differential equation.
The spaces can be characterized by smooth functions. It is a well known work from some mathematicians.There is a strong relation between Soblev space and Besov space. Sobolev spaces was introduced by Russian mathematician Sergei Sobolev in 1930s. His creating space has great application for analyzing of solution of ordinal differential equations and partial differential equations. According to above the applications, we had had natural question of how to characterize of the space by space of classical functions. However, in 1964 year, we had a partial answer of that from working of Meyers and Serrin.
Meyers-Serrin's theorem is well known for how to characterize to Sobolev spaces by collection of functions can classical derivative up to given oder same as order of distributional derivative of the Sobolev space. In this section, we shall first recall that definition of Sobolev spaces and set to several preliminaries as follows.
Here, Ω is an open set in ℝ"" and 1 ≤ "p" ≤ +∞. The natural number "m" is called the order of the Sobolev space "W"(Ω).

The 1556 Shaanxi earthquake was a very bad earthquake that occurred on the morning of 23 January 1556 in Shaanxi, during the Ming Dynasty. It killed around 830,000 people, making it the worst earthquake in human history by number of deaths. 
More than 97 counties in the provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Gansu, Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu and Anhui were affected. The earthquake destroyed a area. In some counties, 60% of the population was killed. It had a magnitude of around 8.0.
At the time, many people in that area lived in homes they made from artificial caves. Loess, the material that made these caves, is known to be very weak and can cause landslides. Scholars believe that is why so many people had died.

The divine right of kings, was a political and religious doctrine. It meant that a monarch was given the right to rule by God alone. His authority could not be questioned because he ruled in God's name. It gave a king absolute rule over his subjects.
Pharaohs and some other ancient Kings were thought to actually be gods or descendants of gods. That concept went away when monotheism spread. A medieval principle held that God gave the right in to rule in secular matters to political rulers. God gave the right to rule over spiritual matters to the Pope as head of the Church. This has been called the 'doctrine of the two swords'. In 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as the Holy Roman Emperor. From that time on the Emperor was the secular power while the Pope was the power. This concept began to break down prior to the First Crusade. Rather than have the Emperor provide the manpower for the crusade, the Pope called on the nobility of Europe directly.
In England, Henry VIII broke free of the Catholic church and the authority of the Pope. By the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 Henry was both king and the head of the Church of England. Following the Protestant Reformation the theory of divine right gave the king absolute authority as God's representative on earth in both political and spiritual matters. It made him accountable to no one but God. James I of England in his speech to Parliament in 1609 said:
In France the theory had been considered from the 13th century. While France remained Catholic, her kings gradually pulled away from papal rule. By the 16th century the king replaced the pope as supreme authority over the French church. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688–89 the divine rights theory was no longer popular in England. In France, kings including Louis XIV of France (1643–1715) continued the divine rights doctrine. That was until the French revolution in 1789. By the 19th century it no longer had any . 
The Chinese culture had a similar but older concept called the 'Mandate of Heaven'. A good ruler had the blessings of heaven. But one who ruled badly would cause the mandate to be removed. When the People's Republic of China was formed in 1949, they claimed the Mandate of Heaven from the people.

Jan Purkyně

Jan Evangelista Purkyně (17 or 18 December 1787 – 28 July 1869) was a Czech anatomist and physiologist. He was one of the best known scientists of his time. In 1839, he coined the term 'protoplasm' for the fluid substance of a cell. 
Purkyně was born in Bohemia, which was then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now it is in the Czech Republic. In 1818, he graduated with a degree in medicine, and was appointed Professor of Physiology. He published two volumes which contributed to experimental psychology. He created the world's first Department of Physiology at the University of Breslau in Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland), and the world's first official physiology laboratory.
He is best known for his discoveries of Purkinje cells and Purkinje fibres. Purkinje cells are large neurons with many branching dendrites found in the cerebellum. Purkinje fibres conduct electrical impulses to all parts of the ventricle of the heart. Other discoveries include Purkinje images, reflections of objects from structures of the eye, and the Purkinje shift, the change in the brightness of red and blue colours as light intensity decreases gradually at dusk. Purkyně also introduced the scientific terms plasma (for the component of blood left when the suspended cells have been removed) and protoplasm (the substance found inside cells.)
Purkyně was the first to use a microtome to make wafer thin slices of tissue for microscopic examination and was among the first to use an improved version of the compound microscope. He described the effects of camphor, opium, belladonna and turpentine on humans in 1829. He also experimented with nutmeg that same year, when he "washed down three ground nutmegs with a glass of wine and experienced headaches, nausea, euphoria, and hallucinations that lasted several days", which remain a good description of today's average nutmeg binge. Purkyně discovered sweat glands in 1833 and published a thesis that recognised nine principal configuration groups of fingerprints in 1823.
Purkyně was, in the opinion of Henry Harris, the true father of the cell theory. The work of Purkyně and his student and collaborator Gabriel Valentin (1810–1883) was "unjustly denigrated by the nationalistic Germans. They have a claim to some priority in the cell theory". 
Johannes Müller (1801–1858) also made great contributions. However, it was Theodor Schwann and Matthias Schleiden (1804–1881) who got the credit for the cell theory, despite the fact that some of their observations were not correct, and their credits to previous workers were "a travesty".

As the simple wikipedia is meant to teach people English, I thought I'd relate the Word Highlighting subfeature of the Speech Selection feature of both the IPAD and IPHONE (io6+). It speaks the selected text with a karaoke effect, that is, the word is highlighted as it is being spoken. People who are learning English and not able to listen to English might like this feature as it gets them off the ground as far as listening to English goes.
In order to turn on the feature, Go to 
SETTINGS/GENERAL/ACCESSIBILITY/SPEECH SELECTION
Turn WORD HIGHLIGHTING on. From then on any selected text (in any application) will have a SPEAK tab above it. Selecting the SPEAK tab will speak the selected text with a karaoke effect. The effect is not that great on the IPHONE because the words are very small and the spoken text is rather faint, but it is quite good on the IPAD where the sound is louder and the text is bigger.
I think a person trying to increase their understanding of spoken English (if they are still at a low level) would profit from the effect.
An important arbitration on English wiki reached these conclusions:
The arbitrator noted the difference between "content creation" edits and "maintenance" edits. Maintenance tasks should not change the meaning of the article for the casual reader, he explained. These tasks include categorisation, stub sorting, adding wikilinks, formatting and stylistic changes such as number and position of headers or placement of images, and simple copy-editing such as grammar and spelling fixes.
Content creation would include addition and removal of text, images, tables, references and so on—and infoboxes—and should be done by an editor who has some knowledge of the subject... "editors should not go through a group of articles, adding infoboxes to each systematically".

Hello,
I have taken and introduced two subcategories "Cat:Places where alcohol is served", and "Cat:Alcohol drinking habits". I have a problem though, Christianity and alcohol and Prohibition Era do not really fit there. On the other hand, introducing a category or the historical aspects does not make much sense either, as we currently only have two pages...

English wiki has two different pages for sea and ocean , covering a closely similar topic. We have two quite different pages. Our sea is a list; our ocean is a substantive topic.

Dear colleagues from Simple English Wikipedia, I have made a proposal for an Individual Engagement Grant: .
It is a proposal to conduct a feasibility study by a scientific research institute, for using Wikidata in the long-term goal as an open Artificial Intelligence for improving quality of Wikipedia articles. 
Funding should be for the most part by local authorities or by FFG - Austrian Research Promotion Agency. This could be a model for further funding of Wikimedia research projects, especially of Wikidata, but also for Wikipedia.
Could you please have a look, comment, give me tips to improve it? 
Thank you very much!

I don't think that the "Punishment" article, https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment is neutral because it only gives us the European idea and negative views of punishment. I really feel that I have to make this article better. It feels one-sided. Maybe include:

I think we are going to need a clear policy line to prevent over-categorisation. Both the creation of categories and their application on pages needs restraint. The general policy of not having such detailed categories as En wiki is well agreed between us, but we have allowed it to be breached ad lib, often by users who are not familiar with our ways. Have a look at what user 91.125.105.165 has been doing, for example (I have cut back on her/his use of overlapping categories on some ballet pages). Also, we should ask for deletion of new categories which appear to breach our policy. I would like to see a way to ban unregistered users from creating categories: it is not a matter for random visitors to our wiki, it is a matter for our regular users to decide.

This needs to be examined further before it gets out of hand. Do we really need to separate things like , , and into gender and orientation? We've got with three entries in it. Why the rush to split them out? In several instances, we seem to have gone a step further than the English Wikipedia in our category tree: and are now being split by nationality, and have been split so for quite some time already. We're now splitting them even further, , while even the nationality categories have been . We've got , while enwiki lumps it all into . Maybe we should question why we're going the extra step? Especially since we hardly have the numbers to make it worthwhile, in my opinion. There seems to be an obsession over categorising people by sexuality, sometimes to the extent where biographical stubs are being created with undue weight on sexuality, with almost nothing on their careers or what actually makes them notable.

Hello everyone,
I have brought groups of students to SEWP to work as editors and contribute to the project several times. I am planning to start again tomorrow. I will ask them to preface their usernames with the initials TMD for our school. As before, please do let me know if you see anything wrong, but I will try to keep on top of all of their edits. I am mainly worried about copyright violation and correct attribution, but that has not been a significant problem in the past.
I will start them on creating userpages and basic editing tomorrow. I try to stop them from creating new pages immediately, but a few slip away and jump ahead anyhow. That actually shows some enthusiasm, so I hate to delete those pages immediately. I hope anything new can be fixed and cleaned up. 
I will tag pages we are editing with a school project template, but don't be hands off. Please do edit those pages. That would be a huge help. Having actual communication online to collaborate on making something can be a great experience for language learners.

These categories were always used for series that started in the year, although the old name didn't specify that. There was at least one series that was in more than one of these categories, where it should have been in just one of them but also in at least one decade category (such as "1960s television series"). The new categories are all under . (I don't see the need to group them at this time.) For now, I have left the old categories as redirects to the new ones.

We have a hodge-podge of articles on years and decades. See 1051, 1052 and 1050s for examples. What I would like to do is change a bunch of the decade articles to be like 540s with each year article a redirect to the section in the decade article. Assuming you all think that is a fabulous idea, what would be a good starting year? And what year, if any, would be a good point to stop the decade only articles and do each year separate? The more recent centuries have a ton more information, but that could be cherry-picked to a reasonable amount. Thanks in advance for your ideas and suggestions! -- () 20:18, 5 November 2013 (UTC)
What to do when all 3 of us are right? The articles "are" an inconsistent mess, decade articles "should" reflect the decade not individual years, and data lists of years "are" of questionable use. So, what about removing the list structure? Write the (really) significant information in prose style with as the only box. I'll give it a go this week and link some examples. Given the quantity of articles, I probably will not fiddle with anything more recent than 1600. -- () 06:10, 20 November 2013 (UTC)
I think my original idea got lost - the articles on years and decades are a mess. I would like them to have more consistency and be appropriate for this wiki and am willing to do the work. The more recent centuries have too much information, which is a different problem. Prior to year 1600 or so there is randomness. Hoping that by breaking out some ideas we can find agreement on a few. NOTE:proposals are only for years up to 1600.

(Also not sure if this is related to another script I had working at least two months ago which displayed various handy links that aid in crosswiki editing...) -- 14:14, 22 November 2013 (UTC)
Working fine for me. If TC's solution doesn't work, maybe it's something to do with your local settings...? () 06:27, 23 November 2013 (UTC)
Would it be appropriate to have a banner at the start of an article to show the target audience of the article. This will help people to see whether the article is meant for younger readers or for older readers who are learning English. () 14:23, 14 November 2013 (UTC)
Focus is something that I think we badly need. However, I doubt that marking articles as suitable for a particular grade would ever develop into common practice. Assessments of the overall difficulty level would be more helpful to all readers. Though several wikis use them liberally to show things like FA/GA-status, I personally find that message-box banners distract considerably from the content. Placing such banners on the talk page instead would be preferable, to my mind, but that might be too obscure. () 20:17, 15 November 2013 (UTC)
If we were to do this, would that mean that an article labelled as suitable for a particular age group had to stay that way? I would be against that, because I think articles should be able to evolve wherever their subject matter needs to go. Who would determine the target audience of a particular article? If the original author, wouldn't that be a type of ? Any editor who wanted to tag the article? That would result in inconsistency. I do not want to see us going down this road. -- () 21:03, 15 November 2013 (UTC)
For what it's worth, I spent some time wandering around this wiki wondering what it was for. Then I saw Wu Chinese had been created with nonsense and decided to take a look at the "regular" article. Oh my goodness! Now I know what some of Wikipedia's critics are talking about when they say it's inaccessible. I'm starting to understand that there can be value to the Simple English wiki beyond dumbing it down for schoolchildren. I would say I agree with those who oppose this proposal for multiple reasons, but when it comes to the fundamental question of target audience, learners of English, regardless of age, is my answer. () 03:55, 2 December 2013 (UTC)
The names of these Chinese cities redirect to the articles on the provinces they're part of. It seems to have been done simply to turn a red link into a blue one. Would anyone like to have a go at making articles out of them? If not, I am thinking we should delete the redirects.

It seems like Orphan tags are rarely used nowadays even though Simple Wikipedia has a lot of orphaned pages, some of which are movie articles, others of which are musicians, actors, singers and certain other celebrities. There are also orphaned pages relating with other topics, including fish, tropical cyclones and certain foods. It's as if Simple English Wikipedia has changed the rule over the three years I've been working around here. September 1988 05:55, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

—Preceding comment added 12:00, 18 November 2013 (UTC).
Lately we've had a couple of school projects editing articles on here. I'm very considered about the quality of the articles being produced. Many of these articles are either very complex or very poorly written. Because of the nature of these being merely class assignments, students are not learning what a proper Wikipedia is, and they are not staying around to make them into proper articles. Since we are a small project, it is hard for us to then take those articles and make them into something proper. Take this one for example. It sat in this state for almost a year. Or this from May 2013. And what are we going to do with articles like cognitive neuropsychology, sport psychology, or cognitive development when the class members are done with their class in a few weeks?
I think we really need to figure something out in terms of how to work with these projects to mutual benefit for both the students and Simple Wikipedia. Does anyone have any insight/ideas of what we can do? () 20:58, 7 December 2013 (UTC)
I always make sure class project pages (and their talk pages) are tagged, so that they're put on the backlog for later. After three months without edits, a page goes into . I've been slowly working my way through copy-editing them. I've also sent a few to get deleted because their subjects weren't notable or because they were too complex. I guess not a lot of editors are aware that that category exists, so there aren't many who actively go through it. is another editor who I've noticed doing quite a few. If more editors knew about the category, they might be willing to help out. The articles from CSH (a Quebecois school) take time, because English is clearly something the students were learning. The same goes for the ones from TMU, although in that case the teacher has fixed up most of the pages. I guess the problem with these psychology pages will be simplifying them. Cutting them down to a few sentences would be the easiest thing to do, I guess.
I personally have no problem with allowing school projects to develop articles at their own pace. As long as the pages aren't breaking policies in any way, then the tag should be enough to let readers know why there might be problems with the page. If they're still crappy after 3 months, then I send them to RfD. It would be nice if they all got an ambassador, but many don't. () 05:32, 8 December 2013 (UTC)
Hi all, as someone who has brought students to SEWP, I'll jump here briefly. First off, many thanks to especially for his help. But, also to everyone here at Simple for being patient. The students in my class have a range of English proficiency, so some of their work is not as good as others. That said, I think they've mostly added to Simple. I try to keep on top of their work so nothing sits around too long. I was unaware of the stale class projects template, but that is very helpful. That showed me two that I missed.
I have avoided using sandboxes or heavy pre-approval of new articles with these students for two reasons. One, the primary reason to bring them here is an authentic audience. We can do collaborative writing on GDocs or in a sandbox, but nobody outside class will ever read it. Two, it gives them some freedom. Choice is an important aspect of motivation, and SEWP gives learners plenty of freedom. I do ask them to check with me before creating new articles, but sometimes one or two students just go ahead anyway. It gets a little difficult, but frankly I am happy that they are motivated enough to go ahead and try something on their own. I hope we haven't been too disruptive.
Very few of the students continue after the class ends. They are just too busy, and if it isn't assessed for a grade, it generally doesn't get done. That said, they do like the activity, and I hope that exposing them to Wikipedia now may pay off later in new editors (mostly in Japanese) down the road. None of them come in knowing that they can contribute to articles. Doing it gives them a new understanding of the information they read on Wikipedia sites. Finally, I hope that other editors who have not worked with second or foreign language learners will get some perspective on how some of them write.
I'll continue to try to keep their work organized, but if anyone is concerned, this is probably the last semester I will use SEWP with a large class of students. I'm getting different students now with different needs from when I started using SEWP with TMD students. Thanks, () 22:29, 9 December 2013 (UTC)
A while back, I discussed the possibility of a feedback system with Osiris, on my . I was suggesting "Maybe a function at the bottom of the page which acts as a poll (such as the review function on other wikis), but have the following: On a scale of 1-10, how simple to read did you find the article? 1-2-3-4... (select one to rate) or maybe How easy to understand was this article: Very simple - simple - quite difficult - difficult - very difficult? (select one to rate). And then have a message saying To tell us more about what you think, click here (link redirects to new section on Talk page)." I was wondering, how useful does the community think this would be, and if possible, how easy would it be to implement such a system? 13:26, 8 December 2013 (UTC)
Like I said back then, I think any well-designed tool that facilitates user feedback would be beneficial. Focusing purely on reading difficulty, and restricting to a simple multiple-choice score (like Yottie suggests, "Very simple - simple - quite difficult - difficult - very difficult") would not generate any problems with vandalism and editors would not feel obliged to respond. Placement might be an issue: since we have mostly small articles, anything taking up space at the bottom would probably be intrusive. The boxes in the English Wikipedia's feedback tool are pretty massive considering what's in them. Something smaller and out of the way would be better for us. Those are my thoughts. () 22:23, 8 December 2013 (UTC)
I'm undecided. I'm not sure how useful it would be, but it has the "potential" to be useful. If it was implemented then its something I'd be happy to help maintain. At the same time though I'm not disagreeing with the opposers. 12:48, 9 December 2013 (UTC)
This template is putting articles into categories for articles containing potentially dated information, and I don't think it needs to. It seems to be related to specifying the year for the population figure. The template uses template for that code, and I don't know that it needs to. Can someone take a look at it? -- () 01:46, 10 December 2013 (UTC)
There's a proposal going around to add a feature to . It's at . () 22:57, 12 December 2013 (UTC)
Working on and ran into Slope. Should it be changed to a normal disambiguation page with separate articles for each meaning? Or since there are only a few meanings, is the current article preferred? Thanks!-- () 04:17, 13 December 2013 (UTC)
It's good that we have some editors here who keep track of deaths of notable people and update articles about them. When adding information after someone dies, please be sure to check the whole article and change everything to past tense. Here are some things that were missed in one of these articles recently:
Here's a little grammar information that might help. See those examples with the word "has" right before another verb? The term for that is "present perfect tense". It's used for things that have happened in the past, but which might not be finished or complete. (When talking about more than one person, you would see "have" instead of "has".) In these examples, when the person was living he might still be nominated for more things, might still win more things, and might still receive more things. After a person dies, these things wouldn't happen any more, so the verb needs to change. (Yes, things can be won posthumously -- after a person dies -- but you still change the verb for that because the action for which a person wins something was done when he/she was alive.)
I hope that helped and wasn't too complex. Feel free to ask if you have any questions. -- () 20:14, 15 December 2013 (UTC)
I have started a discussion at about what should be allowed in this category. Your comments are invited there. -- () 08:25, 19 December 2013 (UTC)

Roger I de Montgomery

Roger I de Montgomery, was the (lord) of Montgomery and vicomte of the Hiesmois in Normandy.
Roger was the son of Hugh de Montgomery and his wife Josceline. She was the niece of Gunnora, Duchess of Normandy. Roger held the lands of Saint-Germain-de-Montgommery and Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery. Both had traces of early castles. He became the Viscount of the Heismois about the same time Robert I of Normandy became Duke in 1027. But as the viscount he witnessed a royal charter to the abbey of St. Wandrille . Like Duke Robert, Roger began taking properties that belonged to the church. These included () half the town of Bernay. He took over a woodland at 'Crispus Fagidus' which belonged to Jumièges Abbey. He put an end to a market held by the same abbey and took it into his own domain. Later he seemed to have a change of heart. He returned the market to the abbey and paid restitution for their losses.
After 1035 Roger seems to have lost favor with the young duke William. He signed an early charter of Duke William simply as 'Roger of Montgomery'. He apparently was no longer the viscount. In 1037 when rebellions broke out, Roger was one of the rebels. When he was defeated he fled to the court of Henry I of France. Roger was forced into exile by Osbern the Steward. Osbern was later killed by William de Montgomery, Roger's son. Where and when Roger died is unknown. In 1068 his wife was still holding lands at Bures and Saint-Pair.
The name of Roger's wife is unknown but he had five sons:

Paradox of thrift

The paradox of thrift is the idea that during a recession, people will want to save more money. But if everyone saves money, then the economy can slow down even more, reducing peoples' income as a result. It is often linked with John Maynard Keynes. It is a main theory of Keynesian economics.
It is a kind of prisoner's dilemma: saving benefits each individual but damages the general population. This is a paradox because it is contrary to intuition. Someone might think that what seems to be good for an individual in the economy will be good for the entire population. However, exercising thrift may be good for an individual by enabling that individual to save for a "rainy day", and yet not be good for the economy as a whole.
There is little agreement as to how important this is in a modern economy. Modern economies are huge, and much affected by other national economies.

Mora (ship)

The Mora was William the Conqueror's flagship for his invasion of England in 1066. It served as his personal ship between England and Normandy afterwards. It was the largest and fastest ship in his invasion fleet. The Mora was a gift to William by his wife Matilda of Flanders.
The "Mora" was built at Barfleur in Normandy. It was a gift from Matilda of Flanders to her husband Duke William of Normandy. It was completed in the summer of 1066. Mora was a larger ship that could carry ten to twelve knights with their , weapons and . It would also have a crew to sail it. The captain of the ship was Stephen, the son of Airard. Stephen was the captain of the Mora for over twenty years. Orderic Vitalis described the ship: "it had for its the image of a child, gilt, pointing with its right hand towards England, and having in its mouth a trumpet of ivory. "Mora" carried sails and at the top of the was the papal banner (Pope's flag), consecrated and sent to William from Rome. The banner was described as "a square white banner charged with a gold cross within a blue border."
Before sunset on September 27th, according to William of Poitiers, Duke William's invasion fleet left for England. The Mora led the fleet. Mora carried a lantern on her mast so she could be seen in the dark. A horn also let the other ships know where the Mora was. The Mora was much faster than the other ships. By dawn William found himself in mid-channel, alone, with no other ships in sight. While he waited his servants served him breakfast with wine. Once the others were in sight the fleet proceeded to Pevensey in Sussex. According to Elisabeth van Houts, the meaning of the name is not known although there have been several suggestions. It might be named for the "Morini", ancient inhabitants of Flanders. This is where Matilda was from. The Latin word "mora" has several meanings, none of which seem likely. These range from 'delay' or 'pause' to 'foolish' or 'foolish woman'. Also is the possibility that "Mora" was an anagram of "Amor".

Although the microscope was invented early in the 17th century, it was not much used until Robert Hooke improved the instrument. Then Marcello Malpighi, Hooke, Nehemiah Grew and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek had a virtually untried tool in their hands as they began their investigations. 
Working on frogs and extrapolating to humans, Malpighi demonstrated the structure of the lungs, previously thought to be a homogeneous mass of flesh, and he offered an explanation for how air and blood mixed in the lungs. Malpighi also used the microscope for his studies of the skin, kidneys, and liver. For example, after he dissected the body of a black man, Malpighi made some groundbreaking headway into the origin of black skin. He found that the black pigment was associated with a layer of mucus just beneath the skin.
He was the first to see capillaries in animals, and he discovered the link between arteries and veins. He may have been the first person to see this under a microscope. The microscope let Malpighi discover that the silk worm does not use lungs to breathe, but small holes in their skin called spiracles. This turned out to be true of all insects. 
Because Malpighi had a wide knowledge of both plants and animals, and he made contributions to the study of both. The Royal Society in London published two volumes of his botanical and zoological works in 1675 and 1679. Another edition followed in 1687, and a supplementary volume in 1697. In his autobiography, Malpighi speaks of his "Anatome Plantarum", decorated with the engravings of Robert White (1645–1703) as "the most elegant format in the whole literate world".

Birinus

Birinus ( 650), also St. Birinus was a missionary to Wessex and the first Bishop of Dorchester. His is celebrated on December 3rd. 
Birinus may have been a Lombard by birth. He was sent by Pope Honorius I to help convert pagans in Anglo-Saxon England. The pope first sent him to Genoa. There 
Archbishop Asterius of Milan consecrated Birinus as a bishop. Birinus arrived in southern Britain . He had planned to go to the midlands of England to preach there. But when he found the Gewisse in Wessex were completely pagan, he decided to stay with them. He began to convert the Gewisse (West Saxons) to Christianity. In 635 King Cynegils of Wessex was baptized by Birinus and King Oswald of Northumbria agreed to be his Godfather. This may have been a condition of the marriage between Oswald and Cynegils's daughter, Cyneburh. He gave Bishop Birinus the city of Dorchester and several churches so he could convert the pagans in Wessex. 
In Birinus founded a church at Winchester which later became Winchester Cathedral. Birinus died in 650. He was buried at Dorchester. 
After 660 there were no more West Saxon Bishops at Dorchester. Along with part of Berkshire it was taken over by Mercia. The new see for Wessex was now at Winchester. Some time around 690–700 Bishop Hedda of Winchester had the relics (bones) of St. Birinus moved from Dorchester to Winchester. Up to this time Bishop Birinus had been considered a minor saint. In 1223 monks of Dorchester abbey located the tomb of a former Bishop. The body was dressed in the garments and tunic of a bishop so they believed it was St. Birinus. At the time of the discovery miracles were claimed. One claim was that a dumb child could suddenly speak English and French. The monks sent their findings to Rome. The pope wrote to Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury asking him to manage the translation. But a problem caused the ceremony to be delayed. Archbishop Langton discovered the body had already been moved to Winchester . Both Dorchester and Winchester claimed to have the relics of Bishop Birinus. For that reason two feast days were observed for him, December 3rd and 4th. The Catholic Church recognizes December 3rd. A shrine was created for him in the 14th century. It was later destroyed, but it has been rebuilt since.

Jan Swammerdam

Jan Swammerdam (12 February 1637 – 17 February 1680) was a Dutch biologist and microscopist. His work on insects showed that the stages an insect life – egg, larva, pupa, and adult – are different forms of the same animal. He did experiments on muscle contraction. In 1658, he was the first to observe and describe red blood cells. He was one of the first people to use the microscope in dissections, and his techniques remained useful for hundreds of years.
Knowledge of insects in the 17th century was to a great extent inherited from Aristotle. Swammerdam dissected insects and studied them under microscopes.
Swammerdam showed that insects develop in the same gradual manner as do other animals. He wanted to dispel the seventeenth-century idea that different life stages of an insect (e.g. caterpillar and butterfly) were different individuals. 
He got evidence from his dissections. By examining larvae, he identified adult features in pre-adult animals. For example, he noticed that the wings of dragonflies and mayflies exist before their final molt. Swammerdam used these observations in his 1669 publication, "Historia Insectorum Generalis" (The Natural History of Insects). This work included many descriptions of insect anatomy. It was here that Swammerdam revealed that the "king" bee has ovaries. "Biblia natura" published posthumously in 1737, carried the first confirmation that the queen bee is the sole mother of the colony. Despite five intense years of beekeeping, the mode of honey bee reproduction escaped him as he wrote, "I do not believe the male bees actually copulate with the females."

John Rosbrugh

Rev. John Rosbrugh (c. 1714–1777) (also spelled Rosborough and Rosburgh) was a graduate of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). He was ordained a Presbyterian minister. In 1776 he organized and commanded the 3rd Northampton County, Pennsylvania . He then then accepted a commission as company chaplain. He was killed at the Battle of the Assunpink Creek, also known as the Second Battle of Trenton. Rosbrugh was the first U.S. chaplain ever killed in battle.
John Rosbrugh was born in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. He to the United States along with his older brother, William. The family was originally from Craigie, County Ayrshire, Scotland. His ancestors went to Ireland during the settling of the Ulster Plantation. In 1733 his young wife Sarah died in childbirth along with their only child. He was a tradesman but well enough educated to prepare himself for college.
He attended the College of New Jersey where he graduated in 1761. He was licensed to preach in August of 1763. In October 1764 he was sent to the congregations of Greenwich, Oxford, and Mansfield Woodhouse, all in western New Jersey. In December 1764 he became a Presbyterian minister. By 1765, he was asked to serve neighboring congregations in Upper and Lower Hardwick in Warren County, New Jersey. In 1766, Rev. Rosbrugh married Jane Ralston. She was the daughter of James Ralston of East Allen Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania. It was then called 'the Irish Settlement.' In 1769 Rev. Rosbrugh was called to serve at the church at Allen Township. This was the same congregation his wife was from. He became their permanent minister. For seven years, he led his congregation in Allen township.
At the start of the American Revolutionary War, news was often read to congregations in their churches. It was one of the main forms of communication at the time. On December 10, 1776, General George Washington called out the militia of Pennsylvania. He wrote to the colonels of the militias of Northampton and Bucks counties asking them and their men to join him as quickly as possible. Rev. Rosebrugh read General Washington's letter to his congregation. The men of the congregation formed a company of militia and agreed to go to war "if" Rev. Rosbrugh would lead them. He had expected to accompany them as their chaplain but reluctantly agreed to lead them. John Rosbrugh took his place at the head of the company and slinging his musket over his shoulder led the company to join General Washington and the Continental Army in Philadelphia.
While in Philadelphia, Rev. Rosbrugh was given a commission as a Chaplain. Captain John Hays took his place as company commander. A chaplain at that time held the rank of major and pay of thirty-three and a half dollars per month. Presbyterian ministers, however, were particularly hated by the British and if captured suffered cruel treatment. Rev. Rosbrugh’s company joined the rest of the Northampton county militia in camp. Rosbrugh also met with his brother-in-law, John Ralston, a member of the Second Continental Congress. The 3rd Battalion was under the command of General Israel Putnam. He had orders to cross the Delaware on the 25th of December in support of Washington’s surprise attack on Trenton. However General Putnam decided not to cross due to weather conditions. So Rev. Rosbrugh’s battalion remained in Philadelphia. After General Washington crossed back to Pennsylvania he decided to take Trenton a second time. This time the 3rd Northampton militia was included. The battle was called the second battle of Trenton or the battle of Assinpink creek.
On the afternoon of January 2nd the Americans were preparing their positions for the upcoming battle. Rev. John Rosbrugh was dining at a public house when a warning was shouted that Hessians were coming. Going outside he found his horse had been taken. He tried to get back to the American lines which were on the other side of Assunpink Creek. But he was suddenly confronted by a company of Hessians under the command of a British officer. He surrendered but they recognized him as a Presbyterian minister. The Hessians him to death. They took his watch and money then left his body naked in the snow. Captain Hays, the company commander, recovered the body and quickly buried him where he fell. The next morning Rev. George Duffield, a brother Presbyterian chaplain moved Rev. Rosbrugh's body to the nearby graveyard of the First Presbyterian Church of Trenton. It is believed he still rests there today. His widow, Jane (née Ralston) survived him by 32 years. She was buried in the East Allen Township cemetery, the inscription on her tombstone indicating her husband John is buried beside her.

Grand Coulee Dam

The Grand Coulee Dam is a dam on the Columbia River in the United States state of Washington. The dam forms Lake Franklin D. Roosevelt. The dam was built between 1933 and 1942, with a new powerplant added between 1967 and 1974. The dam is operated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.
Grand Coulee Dam is high and long. The lake behind it can hold more than of water.
The dam provides water for agriculture in Central Washington. Water is pumped from Lake Roosevelt to Banks Lake, located in the Grand Coulee. From there it runs by gravity to irrigate about of fertile farmland. Incorporated in the late 1940s and early 1950s, this scheme is known as the Columbia Basin Project.
Grand Coulee also produces hydroelectricity. In fact, it is the largest electric-power producing facility in the United States. At full load the dam can produce 6,809 megawatts or enough for 5 million typical American households. The dam was an important source of power for factories during World War II. Today, it provides much of the cheap electric power for the Pacific Northwest.
Among other benefits include flood control for the lower Columbia River and recreational boating and fishing on Lake Roosevelt.
As a consequence of the dam's construction, the reservoir flooded large tracts of Native American lands. Salmon can no longer migrate to the upper Columbia River system.

Relative atomic mass

A relative atomic mass (also called atomic weight; symbol: "A") is a measure of how heavy atoms are. It is the ratio of the average mass per atom of an element from a given sample to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom. In other words, a relative atomic mass tells you the number of times an average atom of an element from a given sample is heavier than one-twelfth of an atom of carbon-12. The word "relative" in relative atomic mass refers to this scaling relative to carbon-12. Relative atomic mass values are ratios; relative atomic mass is a dimensionless quantity. Relative atomic mass is the same as "atomic weight", which is the older term.
The number of protons an atom has determines what element it is. However, most elements in nature consist of atoms with different numbers of neutrons. An atom of an element with a certain number of neutrons is called an isotope. For example, the element thallium has two common isotopes: thallium-203 and thallium-205. Both isotopes of thallium have 81 protons, but thallium-205 has 124 neutrons, 2 more than thallium-203, which has 122. Each isotope has its own mass, called its isotopic mass. A relative isotopic mass is the mass of an isotope relative to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom. The relative isotopic mass of an isotope is roughly the same as its mass number, which is the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Like relative atomic mass values, relative isotopic mass values are ratios with no units.
We can find the relative atomic mass of a sample of an element by working out the abundance-weighted mean of the relative isotopic masses. For example, if a sample of thallium is made up of 30% thallium-203 and 70% thallium-205,
Two samples of an element that consists of more than one isotope, collected from two widely spaced sources on Earth, are expected to have slightly different relative atomic masses. This is because the proportions of each isotope are slightly different at different locations.
A standard atomic weight is the mean value of relative atomic masses of a number of normal samples of the element. Standard atomic weight values are published at regular intervals by the Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). The standard atomic weight for each element is on the periodic table.
Often, the term relative atomic mass is used to mean standard atomic weight. This is not quite correct, because relative atomic mass is a less specific term that refers to individual samples. Individual samples of an element could have a relative atomic mass different to the standard atomic weight for the element. For example, a sample from another planet could have a relative atomic mass very different to the standard Earth-based value.
Relative atomic mass is not the same as:

Rodrigo López

Roderigo López (1525 – June 7, 1594) was a physician of Portuguese background. He was tried and executed for trying to poison Elizabeth I. He is believed to be the inspiration for Shakespeare's character Shylock in "The Merchant of Venice".
López was born into a family of Jewish origin in Portugal. He graduated from university with a degree in medicine. He went to England where he was appointed chief physician to Elizabeth I in 1586. He knew powerful men at court, and grew rich and respected. He was involved in various court intrigues until convicted of plotting to poison the Queen. He was hanged, drawn and quartered. 
Several contemporaries make reference to the trial and execution. Christopher Marlowe mentions it in "Doctor Faustus" as do Thomas Dekker in "Whore of Babylon" and Thomas Middleton in "A Game at Chess". It is possible that Shylock in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" was inspired by López. my dads bald
Queen Elizabeth I’s physician, Roderigo Lopez, was tried and executed for allegedly plotting to kill the queen in 1594. As a Portuguese double agent, ‘Doctor Lopez a Jew’ was said to have conspired with the Spanish, England’s enemies at that time. He was accused of attempting to kill the Portuguese King Antonio and ‘take away Queene Elizabeths life by poyson’, in return for ‘fifty thousand Crowns’

Marination is the process of soaking foods in a liquid before cooking. The idea is to add flavour, and to tenderize tougher cuts of meat.
The liquid in question, the 'marinade', may be acidic (made with ingredients such as vinegar, lemon juice, or wine) or enzymatic (made with ingredients such as pineapple, papaya or kiwifruit). In addition to these ingredients, a marinade often contains oils, herbs, and spices to further flavour the food.
The process may last seconds or days. Different marinades are used in different cuisines. For example, in Indian cuisine the marinade is usually prepared with a mixture of spices.

Hôtel Ritz Paris

The Hôtel Ritz is a grand hotel in the heart of Paris in the Place Vendôme. The hotel is ranked highly among the most prestigious and luxurious hotels in the world and is a member of "The Leading Hotels of the World".
The hotel has 159 rooms. It was founded by the Swiss hotelier, César Ritz, in collaboration with the chef Auguste Escoffier in 1898. The new hotel was constructed behind the façade of a Town house from the 18th-century. It overlooks one of the central squares in Paris.
It was one of the first hotels in Europe to provide a bathroom "en suite", a telephone and electricity for each room. It established a reputation for luxury. The clients have included royalty, politicians, writers, film stars and singers. Several of its suites are named in honour of famous guests of the hotel, for example Coco Chanel and Ernest Hemingway who lived at the hotel for years. One of the bars of the hotel, "Bar Hemingway", is devoted to Hemingway.
The Ritz has the reputation of being the most expensive hotel in Paris. The rooms as of May 2011 started at €850 a night. Suites start at €3,600 and cost up to €13,900 a night for the most expensive ones (the "Suite Impériale" is the most expensive). The Ritz employs more than 600 people.
"L'Espadon" is a world-renowned restaurant. It attracts aspiring chefs from all over the world who come to learn at the nearby Ritz-Escoffier School. The cuisine is run by the award-winning chef Michel Roth, the ninth head chef of the hotel. The restaurant was awarded a second star by the 2009 edition of the influential Michelin Red Guide.
During the Second World War, the German Luftwaffe used the hotel as local headquarters in Paris. The son of César Ritz, Charles, died in 1976. The last members of the Ritz family who owned the hotel sold it to the Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed in 1979. In August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales and Al-Fayed's son, Dodi, dined in the hotel's Imperial Suite before their fatal car crash.
The hotel is being entirely renovated. It has been closed since 1 August 2012 and will open its doors in March 2016, after a delay of nearly two years. Because of its status as a symbol of high society and luxury, the hotel has featured in many novels (for example F. Scott Fitzgerald's "Tender Is The Night" and Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises"),
a play (Noël Coward's "Semi-Monde"), and films (such as Billy Wilder's 1957 comedy "Love in the Afternoon" and William Wyler's 1966 comedy "How to Steal a Million").

Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg

Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (19 April 1795 – 27 June 1876), German naturalist, zoologist, comparative anatomist, geologist, and microscopist, was one of the most famous and productive scientists of his time.
Ehrenberg was appointed professor of medicine at Berlin University in 1827. In 1829 he accompanied Humboldt through eastern Russia to the Chinese frontier. After his return he began to concentrate his studies on microscopic organisms, which then were not much studied.
For nearly 30 years Ehrenberg examined samples of water, soil, sediment, blowing dust and rock and described thousands of new species, among them well-known flagellates such as Euglena, ciliates such as "Paramecium aurelia" and "Paramecium caudatum", and many fossils, in nearly 400 scientific publications. He was particularly interested in a unicellular group of protists called diatoms, but he also studied, and named, many species of radiolaria, foraminifera and dinoflagellates.
These researches built up our knowledge of the microorganisms of certain geological formations, especially of the chalk, and of the marine and freshwater accumulations. Until Ehrenberg took up the study it was not known that considerable masses of rock were composed of minute forms of animals or plants. He also demonstrated that the phosphorescence of the sea was due to organisms.
He was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences from 1836 and a foreign member of the Royal Society of London from 1837. In 1839, he won the Wollaston Medal, the highest award granted by the Geological Society of London. He continued until late in life to investigate the microscopic organisms of the deep sea and of various geological formations. He died in Berlin on 27 June 1876.
After his death in 1876, his collections of microscopic organisms were deposited in the Humboldt Museum at the University of Berlin. The "Ehrenberg Collection" includes 40,000 microscope preparations, 5,000 raw samples, 3,000 pencil and ink drawings, and nearly 1,000 letters of correspondence. His collection of scorpions, and other arachnids from the Middle East, is also held in the Berlin Museum.

Afro-Haitians or Black Haitians are Haitian people whose ancestors were Africans. Most Afro-Haitians are descended from West African slaves. The slaves were brought over to work in plantations, mainly for sugar canes.
The vast majority (about 90%) of Haitians are of African descent. Of them, about 25-30% are of mixed-race, or Mulatto.
Haiti, just like in any region in the Americas, received slaves from all over West and Central Africa. Although Haitian slaves were from all over Africa, the most common were Kongos from the Congo region, and Ewe and Fon tribes of current-day Benin or Togo. There was also a lot of Igbo people from Nigeria.
Haitian Voodoo is obviously from the Fon people of Benin, when they came in large numbers as slaves to work in plantations as maids, farmers, and sugar cane cutters have kept their traditions strong and alive till this day after 300 years away from their original home.
The African influence can also be seen in the language Haitians use to speak; Haitian Creole is a French-based language with strong African influence in the phonetics, vocabulary, syntax, grammar, pronunciations. There are many words of African origin used in every day speech. Haitian food is mostly of African origin, including the names of the food. The music of Haiti is filled with African rhythms and instruments, the use of call and response as well as vocal African songs.

Norman Tindale

Norman Barnett Tindale AO (12 October 1900 – 19 November 1993) was an Australian anthropologist, archaeologist and ethnologist. He worked for the South Australian Museum for almost 50 years. He is best known for his work mapping the various cultural groupings of Indigenous Australians.
He was born in Perth, Western Australia. His family moved to Tokyo in 1907, when he was a young boy. Norman was educated at the American School in Japan. The family returned to Perth in 1915, and then moved to Adelaide in 1917. Tindale got a job at the Adelaide Public Library. In January 1919, he got a job at the South Australian Museum as entomologist's assistant to Arthur Mills Lea. He had already published thirty-one papers on entomological, ornithological and anthropological subjects before receiving his Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Adelaide in March 1933.
Tindale began mapping the cultural groupings of Indigenous Australians early in his career. His interest in this began during a research trip to Groote Eylandt in 1921–1922. On the island, an Anindilyakwa man gave Tindale detailed descriptions of which land belonged to his family and which land did not. This led Tindale to question the widely held belief among European Australians at the time, which was that Aboriginal people were nomadic and had no connection to any specific area. Tindale's maps have been superseded by more accurate ones.
After his retirement from the South Australian Museum, Tindale began teaching at the University of Colorado. He lived in the United States until his death, aged 93, in Palo Alto, California.
Tindale was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1994, shortly after his death.

Savoy Hotel

The Savoy Hotel is a luxury hotel on the Strand in central London. It was built by impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte with profits from his Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and opened on 6 August 1889. It was the first in the Savoy group of hotels and restaurants, which were owned by his family for over a century. 
The Savoy was the first luxury hotel in Britain. It had electric lights throughout the building, electric lifts, bathrooms in most of the lavishly furnished rooms, constant hot and cold running water, and many other innovations. D'Oyly Carte hired manager César Ritz and French chef Auguste Escoffier, who established the highest quality in service, entertainment and dining. The hotel attracted royalty and other rich guests and diners. Winston Churchill frequently took his cabinet to lunch at the hotel.
The hotel became Carte's most successful venture. Its bands, Savoy Orpheans and the Savoy Havana Band, became famous, and other entertainers (who were also often guests) included George Gershwin, Frank Sinatra, Lena Horne and Noël Coward. Famous guests have included Edward VII, Enrico Caruso, Charlie Chaplin, Otto Hahn, Harry Truman, Joan Crawford, Judy Garland, Babe Ruth, Laurence Olivier, Marilyn Monroe, John Wayne, Humphrey Bogart, Elizabeth Taylor, Barbra Streisand, Bob Dylan, The Beatles and numerous others.
The hotel is now managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. It has been called "London's most famous hotel". It is still one of London's most prestigious and opulent hotels, with 268 rooms and panoramic views of the River Thames across Savoy Place and the Thames Embankment. The hotel closed in December 2007 for extensive renovations and reopened in October 2010.

Dorothy Kilner

Dorothy Kilner (17 February 1755 – 5 February 1836) was an English writer of children's books during the late 18th century.
Dorothy published her first books anonymously. She then published under the pseudonyms M. P. and Mary Pelham. This was common practice among female authors in that period.
Dorothy's most famous book was "The Life and Perambulation of a Mouse". This was published in 1784. Some other books of hers are "Anecdotes of a Boarding School, or an antidote to the vices of those Establishments" (1790), "Little Stories for Little Folks" (about 1785), and "The Village School" (1795). Most of her stories had moral lessons.
Dorothy was probably born in Woodford, which was part of Essex at the time. Her father was Thomas Kilner (1719–1804), a public servant and landowner. Her mother was Frances Kilner (née Ayscough; 1718–1768). Dorothy was the youngest of five children. The family lived in Maryland Point.
Dorothy was inspired to write through her friendship with Mary Ann Maze (Mary Ann Kilner, 1753–1831). The two became friends when they were children. They wrote many letters to each other on religious and personal matters. The letters were usually written in verse. Maze later married Dorothy's brother, Thomas Kilner (1750–1812) in 1774. Dorothy moved into their house in Spitalfields, and helped to raise their five children.
Both Dorothy and Mary Ann became writers, and wrote many books for children. Their books were published by John Marshall. Copies of their books were found long after their deaths in a trunk in their home in Maryland Point. Several titles continued to be reprinted for many years.

<doc id="422073" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=422073" title="Female genital mutilation">
Female genital mutilation

Female genital mutilation (FGM) is cutting off part or all of the female genitals that are outside of the body. FGM is also called female genital cutting and female circumcision. It is done for cultural reasons, as part of a ritual, not for medical reasons. 
FGM is most common in 27 African countries, as well as Yemen and Iraqi Kurdistan. However, it also happens in other countries in Asia, the Middle East, and around the world. Usually, FGM is not done by a doctor or in a hospital. It is often done with a razor blade, sometimes without anesthesia. 
Different ethnic groups do different kinds of FGM. They also do FGM at different ages. Some groups do FGM when infants are only a few days old. Others do it when girls reach puberty, or are older. In about half the countries where FGM happens, most girls have FGM before they are five years old.
FGM can cause serious health problems, like infections, chronic pain, trouble getting pregnant and giving birth, bleeding so bad that it can kill. FGM does not make a person's health better in any way.
FGM is illegal in most of the countries where it happens. However, these laws are often ignored. Since the 1970s, many countries have tried to stop FGM. In 2012, the United Nations General Assembly said that FGM is a human rights problem, and voted to try harder to stop it. The World Health Organization and the "Maputo Protocol" to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights also say that FGM must be stopped.
There are many different types of female genital mutilation. The World Health Organization (WHO) has created four basic categories of FGM, called Types 1-IV.
In Type I FGM, part or all of the clitoris is cut off. The clitoris is the organ that makes sex feel good for women. Without it, a woman usually cannot have an orgasm.
There are a few forms of Type II FGM. All of them involve cutting off part or all of the inner labia, the two flaps of skin on the sides of the vagina. The forms of Type II FGM are:
Type III FGM is usually called infibulation. It is the most severe form of FGM. The genitals outside a woman's body are cut off and the wound is sewn shut with thread and thorns. The different types of infibulation are:
When the labia are sewn shut, one small hole is left open so the girl can urinate and menstruate. The hole is kept open by putting something like a twig into the wound.To help the wound close, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle, for up to six weeks.
After the woman gets married, her vagina is cut open so she can have sex. A midwife might cut open the vagina with a knife, or the woman's husband might tear it open with his penis. If the woman gets pregnant, the vagina is opened more for childbirth, and then often sewn back up afterward (this is called re-infibulation).
Type IV FGM is anything else that is done to hurt the genitals, like scraping, burning, scarring, or cutting the genitals without cutting them off.
In many countries where FGM is common, almost every woman and girl in the country has had FGM. In other countries, millions of women and girls have had FGM over many years.
In 25 countries in Africa and the Middle East, over 125 million women and girls have had FGM. This includes:
In some of these same 25 countries, FGM is very common. It is most common in these countries:
However, in other countries, FGM is not as common. For example, of the 25 countries where FGM happens most often, it is least common in these countries:
FGM can hurt women's physical and mental health throughout their lives.
The type of complications that people might have from FGM depend on many things, like:
"Short-term complications" are problems caused by FGM soon after the FGM happened. Common short-term complications include:
More serious short-term complications can cause symptoms that can kill a woman. They include:
Nobody knows how many girls and women die from FGM. 
Late complications happen later on after FGM is done. For example:
Painful periods are common because it is very difficult for blood to get out of the tiny hole left by infibulation. Blood can fill the vagina and uterus, and stay there without moving. If the vagina gets completely blocked, the vagina and uterus can fill up completely with menstrual blood. Because women with this problem do not menstruate, and blood builds up in their abdomen (making it swell), it can be confused with pregnancy.
FGM may increase a woman's risk of having problems during pregnancy and childbirth. For example, women who had infibulations are more likely to:
FGM also raises the risk that a woman's baby will die soon after it is born. In 2008, the WHO estimated that 10–20 babies out of every 1,000 die because their mothers had FGM. All types of FGM were found to raise babies' risk of death, which was:
There is not much information about the effects of FGM on women's and girls' mental health. However, a few small studies have found that women with FGM often have anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Studies on how FGM affects women's ability to have sex have also been small. In total, in 2013, there had been 15 studies involving 12,671 women from seven countries. When all the information from these studies was put together, researchers found that:

Heat lightning

Heat lightning is the name for lightning from thunderstorms that are far away that is not followed by thunder. This happens because the lightning is far away and the sound of the thunder stops before it reaches the person watching the thunderstorm. Although it is named heat lightning, it does not have anything to do with the heat of the lightning itself. At night, lightning can be seen from up to 100 miles away, but the thunder doesn't go that far.
Heat lightning is often seen during the summer months. In Florida, heat lightning can often been seen over the water at night from thunderstorms that formed during the day.

Dry thunderstorm

A dry thunderstorm is a type of thunderstorm where there is lightning and thunder, but most or all of the precipitation does not reach the ground. They usually happen in deserts or areas with low water vapor. Because dry air usually absorbs liquid water, the rain is absorbed before it reaches the ground. They happen a lot during the summer months in western North America.
Dry thunderstorms are dangerous because they can cause dust storms and wildfires. Dust storms can happen because the dry soil and sand are picked up by strong winds. Wildfires can happen because the lightning can hit trees and there is no rain to put out the fires.

César Ritz

César Ritz (23 February 1850 – 24 October 1918) was a Swiss hotelier and founder of several hotels. He gave his name to the Hôtel Ritz Paris and The Ritz Hotel in London. His motto was "king of hoteliers, and hotelier to kings". His name is the origin of the word "ritzy".
At fifteen Ritz was apprenticed as a "somelier" (wine waiter) at a hotel in Brig. Dismissed after a year as an unsuitable candidate for the hotel trade, he went to Paris at the time of the 1867 Universal Exhibition.
Ritz's formative five years in Paris, including the siege of 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War, gave him sufficient polish and confidence to transform himself from a waiter and general factotum into a "maître d'hôtel", manager, and eventually hotelier. 
In 1872, Ritz became floor waiter of the Hôtel Splendide in Paris, meeting many rich, self-made Americans as guests. In 1873 he was a waiter in Vienna at the time of the International Exhibition. In the winter of that year his astonishing career in hotel management began when he undertook the direction of the restaurant at the Grand Hôtel in Nice. Regular moves then followed. He followed the migration of the international tourist set from the hotels of Nice or San Remo in winter to Swiss mountain resorts such as Rigi-Kulm and Lucerne in summer.
In 1878, he became the manager of the Grand Hôtel National in Lucerne and held the same position, in parallel, at the Grand Hôtel in Monaco until 1888. A pioneer in the development of luxury hoteliering, he knew how to entice wealthy customers and got a reputation for good taste and elegance. He was the first to say that "the customer is never wrong". His code was "See all without looking; hear all without listening; be attentive without being servile; anticipate without being presumptuous. If a diner complains about a dish or the wine, immediately remove it and replace it, no questions asked".
In 1888, he opened a restaurant with Auguste Escoffier in Baden-Baden, and the two were then invited to London by Richard D'Oyly Carte to become the first manager and chef of the Savoy Hotel, positions they held from 1889 until 1897. Ritz put together what he described as "a little army of hotel men for the conquest of London". The Savoy under Ritz was an immediate success, attracting a distinguished and moneyed clientele, headed by the Prince of Wales. Aristocratic women, hitherto unaccustomed to dine in public, were now "seen in full regalia in the Savoy dining and supper rooms".
In 1898, Ritz and Escoffier were both dismissed from the Savoy. Ritz was implicated in the disappearance of over £3,400 of wine and spirits, as well as kickbacks from suppliers. The following report is from the London "Daily Telegraph":
Later in 1898, he opened the celebrated Hôtel Ritz in the Place Vendôme, Paris. He went on to open The Ritz Hotel in London in 1906, which became one of the most popular meeting places of the era, for the rich and famous. The Hotel Ritz Madrid in Madrid, opened in 1910, inspired by King Alfonso XIII's desire to build a luxury hotel to rival the Ritz in Paris. Ritz enjoyed a long partnership with Auguste Escoffier, the famous French chef and father of modern French cooking. The partnership lasted until Ritz had to retire in 1907 because of deteriorating health.
Ritz himself withdrew progressively from the affairs of his various companies, selling out his interests in hotels at Frankfurt and Salsomaggiore in 1905 and retiring from the Ritz Hotel Development Company in 1907, from the Carlton Hotel Company in 1908, and from the Paris Ritz Company in 1911.
By 1912, according to Marie-Louise Ritz, to all intents and purposes his life had finished. In 1913 he was placed in a private hospital at Lausanne, and the following year he was moved to another on Lake Küssnacht in Canton Schwyz. He died at Küssnacht on 26 October 1918. Although from a humble Swiss background, César Ritz and his luxurious hotels became legendary, and his name entered the English language as an epitome of high-class cuisine and accommodation. He is buried in the village of his birth.

Menu

A menu is a list of dishes to be served at a meal. Menus have been around in Europe since the 18th century. There is a special need for them in Chinese cuisine because of the wide range of dishes on offer. Menus have been discovered from the Song Dynasty in China. In the larger cities of the time, the variety of cuisine from different regions led caterers to create a list for their patrons.
In restaurants, the modern menu, with dishes in a set order of courses, was invented by the great French chef Escoffier. Usually there are two types of menu at a good restaurant:
Lesser establishments might offer a chalkboard, with the advantage that items can be rubbed out or added on at short notice. Fish restaurants in particular depend on daily catches being supplied or bought in the early morning. They usually list fish freshly bought (as opposed to frozen).
In American restaurant management, "menu engineering" has become a branch of marketing.

Armillaria gallica

Armillaria gallica (synonymous with "A. bulbosa" and "A. lutea") is a species of "honey mushroom" in the Agaricales order. 
The species is common and ecologically important: it decays wood. It can live as a saprophyte, or as an opportunistic parasite in weakened tree hosts to cause root or butt rot. It is found in temperate regions of Asia, North America, and Europe. The species forms fruit bodies singly or in groups in soil or rotting wood. The fungus has been accidentally introduced to South Africa. 
"Armillaria gallica" is a largely subterranean fungus, and it produces fruit bodies that are up to about in diameter, yellow-brown, and covered with small scales. On the underside of the caps are gills that are white to creamy or pale orange. 
The fungus develops an extensive system of underground root-like structures, called rhizomorphs which help it to decompose dead wood in temperate broadleaf and mixed forests. It has been the subject of considerable scientific research. Its ability to bioluminesce and its ability to form large and long-lived colonies are especially interesting.
Researchers reported finding "Armillaria gallica" in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the early 1990s. In one forest stand, "Armillaria"-infected oak trees had been harvested, and their stumps were left to rot in the field. Later, when red pines were planted in the same location, the seedlings were killed by the fungus "A. gallica" (then known as "A. bulbosa"). 
Using sequence analysis, they found that the underground mycelia of one individual fungal colony covered , weighing over , with an estimated age of 1,500 years. The analysis examined genetic samples collected in the forest from fruit bodies and rhizomorphs. Samples from the 15-hectare area had identical mating type alleles and mitochondrial DNA fragments. This showed the samples were all from a single genetic individual, or clone, which reached its size through vegetative growth. The authors noted: "This is the first report estimating the minimum size, mass, and age of an unambiguously defined fungal individual. Although the number of observations for plants and animals is much greater, members of the fungal kingdom should now be recognized as among the oldest and largest organisms on earth". After the "Nature" paper was published, media outlets from around the world visited the site where the specimens were found. As a result of this publicity, the individual acquired the common name "humongous fungus". There was afterward some scholarly debate as to whether the fungus qualified to be considered in the same category as other large organisms such as the blue whale or the giant redwood.

<doc id="422314" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=422314" title="Robinson Crusoe">
Robinson Crusoe

Robinson Crusoe is a novel written by Daniel Defoe. It was first published on 25 April 1719 by William Taylor.
The novel's full title is "The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, Of York, Mariner: Who lived Eight and Twenty Years, all alone in an un-inhabited Island on the Coast of America, near the Mouth of the Great River of Oroonoque; Having been cast on Shore by Shipwreck, wherein all the Men perished but himself. With An Account how he was at last as strangely deliver'd by Pyrates".
The book is a fictional autobiography of the title character, Robinson Crusoe. Crusoe leaves the safety of his comfortable middle-class home in England and goes to sea. He is shipwrecked and becomes a castaway who spends years on a remote tropical island near Trinidad. He meets cannibals, captives and mutineers, and is eventually rescued.
For the first edition, Defoe pretended that the novel was a true story. He said the fictional protagonist Robinson Crusoe was the author and he pretended to be the editor of Crusoe's autobiography. This led many readers to believe that Crusoe was a real person and the book a true account of his life.
Many people think the story was influenced by the life of Alexander Selkirk. Selkirk was a Scottish castaway who lived for over four years on a Pacific island belonging to Chile called Más a Tierra. (In 1966, the island was renamed Robinson Crusoe Island.) However, there are other possible sources. For example, Ibn Tufail's earlier novel "Hayy ibn Yaqdhan", also set on a desert island, may have inspired Defoe.
Critical response to "Robinson Crusoe" has been diverse and argumentative. There has been widespread disagreement about the novel's nature and origin, values, structure, and meaning. Literary historians have not agreed on Defoe's sincerity, exact intentions, and achievement in the book.
"Robinson Crusoe" was very popular as soon as it was published. Before the end of 1719, it had already run through four editions. The novel's popularity has continued and it has become one of the most widely published books in history. It has prompted many imitations and adaptations for stage, film, and television.

Years after his first battle against the Titans, Eren finds out that he has the ability to transform into a Titan at will. After others found this out, Eren was seen as a threat to mankind by some but was also seen as a chance of hope by others. He later joins his companions to fight and protect what remains of their society while he also looks for answers to the mysteries surrounding the Titans, the Walls, as well as his own existence.

Spiritual warfare is a Christian belief of fighting against bad supernatural forces (demons). The existence of bad spirits which can affect humans is the main idea for this belief system. Many Christian groups have used ideas of this movement to hold back these bad forces. These ideas mainly come from Christian demonology. A way to fight these forces is by using prayer. Exorcisms (removing demons), laying-on of hands, fasting, or anointing with oil are also used.
Some well known people, such as Bill Ellis, Elliot Miller (Christian Research Institute), and Gretchen Passantino have claimed that ideas in spiritual warfare are based off of Christian stories that are not from the Bible. These stories are not considered true by Christians who believe that only the Bible is fact.

Puffinus

Puffinus is a genus of seabirds in the order Procellariiformes. It is made up of about 20 small to medium-sized shearwaters. Two other shearwater genera are named: "Calonectris", which comprises three large shearwaters, and "Procellaria" with another four large species. The latter are usually called 'petrels', although they are thought to be more closely related to the shearwaters than to the other petrels. Even though their name looks like "puffin", the puffins are auks, and not related to the shearwaters in the genus "Puffinus"; the genus name "Puffinus" is actually a New Latin loanword based on the English "puffin".

Shooting of Trayvon Martin

The shooting of Trayvon Martin was a killing that happened in Sanford, Florida, United States. It happened on the night of February 26, 2012. Martin was shot by George Zimmerman. The case has been given a lot of coverage by the media. Zimmerman was declared not guilty of manslaughter. However, many people believe Zimmerman racially discriminated Martin.
Trayvon Martin was African American. He was a 17-year-old high school student at the time. Martin had been walking to his father's girlfriend's house, where he was staying. He had gone to the 7-Eleven to buy a packet of Skittles. The house was in a gated community. The shooter, George Zimmerman, was the coordinator of the neighborhood watch in this community. Zimmerman is a mixed race Hispanic man. He shot Martin in the chest, killing the teenager.
When he was shot, Martin had been talking on his mobile phone to his girlfriend. He was wearing a hoodie. Zimmerman had thought Martin looked suspicious. He called the emergency telephone number (911) and the operator told him that he did not need to follow Martin. Zimmerman did this anyway. People are not sure what happened after this. When police arrived at the location of the shooting, Zimmerman said that Martin had punched him in the nose and knocked him into the pavement. Martin had not been carrying a weapon when he was shot.
Police did not arrest Zimmerman until six weeks later. This was because of Florida's stand-your-ground law, which allows people to shoot others in order to defend themselves. Zimmerman was put on trial. On July 13, 2013, a jury decided that he was not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Protests were held in more than 100 cities in the United States by people who thought that decision was unfair. President Barack Obama made spoke in response to public anger about the trial verdict on July 19. He said, "Trayvon Martin could have been me, 35 years ago". Maddy, a juror for the trial, told ABC News that Zimmerman "got away with murder".
The media coverage about this case has continued even after Zimmerman was declared not guilty.
Geraldo Rivera said on "Fox and Friends", "I think the hoodie is as much responsible for Trayvon Martin's death as much as George Zimmerman was." This made a lot of people angry. They said it was victim blaming.
An episode of the cartoon comedy "South Park", "World War Zimmerman", was shown in October 2013. It parodied Zimmerman's trial. Jack Cashill wrote a book about the case called "'If I had a Son': Race, Guns, and the Railroading of George Zimmerman". It was published in October 2013.
Zimmerman was arrested on November 18, 2013. Police said that he was going to be put in prison. TMZ said that Zimmerman attacked his pregnant girlfriend. He has been charged with aggravated assault, domestic violence battery and criminal mischief. Zimmerman was released on bail.
In October 2013, Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, demanded changes to the Stand Your Ground law. She said the law "creates many opportunities for people to commit terrible acts of violence and evade justice". She and Martin's father, Tracy Fulton, started the Trayvon Martin Foundation in 2012 to help victims of injustice.
Neighborhood watchers in Sanford are now banned from carrying guns and following people. This is to avoid another event like Martin's killing and to make the neighborhood watch's reputation better.

<doc id="422590" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=422590" title="Roman food">
Roman food

Roman food was mainly got from the Mediterranean area and Gaul (now Spain). Romans enjoyed foodstuffs from the trade networks of the Roman Republic and Empire. Keeping up the food supply to the city of Rome was a major political issue in the late Republic. It became one of the ways the emperor expressed his relationship to the Roman people.
Three meals a day was normal in ancient Rome, as today. In the morning, a breakfast called the "ientaculum" was served at dawn. Later, around 11:00 am, Romans ate a small lunch, and in the evening, they ate the "cena", the main meal of the day. In the Empire period, the "cena" increased in size and diversity. It was now eaten in the afternoon. The "vesperna", a light supper in the evening, was abandoned, and a second breakfast was introduced around noon, the "prandium".
In the lower strata of society, the old routine was kept: it corresponded more closely to the daily rhythms of manual labor.
Originally flat, round loaves made of emmer (a cereal related to wheat) with a bit of salt were eaten; among the upper classes, eggs, cheese, and honey, along with milk and fruit were also consumed. In the Empire period, around the beginning of the Christian era, bread made of wheat was introduced. Later, more and more wheaten foods began to replace emmer bread. Poor romans ate bread, vegetable, soup and porridge. Meat and shellfish were a luxury, unless they lived in the countryside and could go hunting or fishing.
The bread was sometimes dipped in wine and eaten with olives, cheese and grapes. They also ate wild boar, beef, sausages, pork, lamb, duck, goose, chickens, small birds and fish. Romans liked to make mealtimes fun by roasting hare with wings stuck on them to look like a flying horse. 
At dinner slaves gave guests small hot bread rolls to wipe their plates clean. Roman flour contained a lot of dust and bits and this made bread so coarse that it wore down people's teeth. 
The wealthier Romans liked to eat snails flattened on milk, peacock's brains and flamingos tongues. 
Among the upper classes, who did not do manual labor, all business was done in the morning. After the "prandium", a visit would be made to the baths. Around 2 p.m., the "cena" would begin. This meal could last until late in the night, especially if guests were invited, and would often be followed by a round of drinks.
In the period of the kings and the early republic, but also in later periods (for the working classes), the "cena" essentially consisted of a kind of porridge, the "puls". The simplest kind would be made from emmer, water, salt and fat. The more sophisticated kind was made with olive oil, with an accompaniment of assorted vegetables when available. The richer classes ate their "puls" with eggs, cheese, and honey and it was also occasionally served with meat or fish.
Over the course of the Republican period, the "cena" developed into two courses: a main course and a dessert with fruit and seafood (e.g. molluscs, shrimp). By the end of the Republic, it was usual for the meal to be served in 3 parts: 1 course ("gustatio"), main course ("primae mensae"), and dessert ("secundae mensae").
In contrast to the fine banquets, poor people ate the cheapest foods, so they had for breakfast grain made into twice-baked bread and porridge, and for lunch a vegetable and meat stew. The vegetables available included millet, onions, turnips, and olives with bread and oil on the side.
At dinner they had thin soup or meat with cheese, and a pudding of honey.
The Romans mainly drank wine, the main drink of the Empire, and water. The wine could be laced with spices and honey to improve the taste. Slaves poured wine and honeyed water in flasks. Slaves filled goblets with wine from large dishes. However, drinks such as milk were considered uncivilised and hence were only used for children, medical purposes and making cheese. The wine drunk across the empire was produced in Italy, Africa, Gaul, Spain and Greece. Beer was also drunk by Romans in Britain.
Roman kitchens were usually small rooms, simply equipped with built-in clay ovens and wooden cupboards. A charcoal fire heated a brick hearth, where the cook fried or cooked food in earthenware or bronze pots for baking or roasting. They placed meats in the ashes. The Roman kitchens were small compared to the one we have today. The kitchen would also have large jars of olive oil, wine, vinegar and fish sauces, as well as a mortar for grinding up spices. Only richer people had kitchens, although they didn't cook because their slaves did it. Despite the simple facilities, the cooks and slaves produced spicy dishes of shellfish, wild boar, fruits and sweets.

Catopuma

Catopuma is a genus containing two small Asian felines, the Bay cat ("C. badia") and the Asian golden cat ("C. temminckii"). The Bay cat is sometimes classified as "Pardofelis bardia", and the Marbled cat is also in that genus. Because the genetic evidence is that all three cats are closely related, they will probably all be put in "Catopuma" eventually.
The Bay cat and the Asian golden cat are typically reddish brown in colour, with darker markings on the head. They live in forests in South East Asia. The Bay cat is only found on the island of Borneo.

Tommy Flowers MBE (Thomas Harold Flowers, 22 December 1905 – 28 October 1998) was a British engineer. During World War II, Flowers designed Colossus, the world's first programmable electronic computer, to help solve encrypted German messages.
The first Mark 1, with 1500 vacuum tube valves, ran at Dollis Hill in November 1943, and then at Bletchley Park in January 1944. 
A Mark 2 redesign with 2,400 valves had begun before the first computer was finished. The first Mark 2 Colossus went into service at Bletchley Park on 1 June 1944, and immediately produced vital information for the imminent D-Day landing. 
Flowers had a crucial meeting with Dwight D. Eisenhower and his staff on 5 June. A courier handed Eisenhower a note summarizing a Colossus decrypt. This confirmed that Hitler wanted no additional troops moved to Normandy, as he was still convinced that the preparations for the Normandy invasion were a diversionary feint. Eisenhower announced to his staff, "We go tomorrow". 
Earlier, a report from Field Marshall Rommel on the western defences was decoded by Colossus and showed that one of the drop sites for a US parachute division was the base of a German tank division. The site was changed.
Years later, Flowers described the design and construction of these computers.

<doc id="422645" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=422645" title="Penda of Mercia">
Penda of Mercia

Penda ( 655) was a 7th century King of Mercia. He was a noble of the royal house of Mercia and a pagan his entire life. Penda was the central figure in English history from 632 until his death. Penda treated every Northumbrian king as his enemy, especially if that king had any influence in southern England.
Penda was a son of Pybba of Mercia. At his father's death in Penda was still an infant. Ceorl ruled Mercia following Penda's father. There are indications Penda was an underking in Mercia probably in charge of Western Mercia. This would have included the territory of the Hwicce. Later Penda had close ties to the Hwicce when he was king of Mercia.
In 626, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: "This year Penda succeeded to the kingdom [of Mercia] and reigned thirty winters." As king of Mercia Penda's first victory came in 628. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 628 says that Cyngils, king of Wessex, and Cwichelm his son 'fought with Penda at Cirencester and came to an agreement with him there'. The 'agreement' seems to have been to give Cirencester to Penda. It's likely Penda also got the territory of the Hwicce at this time. The agreement or treaty also seems to have been a marriage alliance. Penda married Cynewise, probably a sister of Cynegils. He formed an alliance with Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd. Cadwallon was known to have been very hostile towards the Northumbrians. In 633 Penda joined him in invading Northumbria. At Battle of Hatfield Chase their combined armies defeated and killed King Edwin of Northumbria. Cadwallon remained in Northumbria for a year destroying everything he could. Penda left and returned to Mercia. He brought with him Eadfrith, the son of Edwin, as a prisoner possibly to set up as a puppet ruler in Northumbria under Penda. But Penda had him murdered a few years later. 
Sometime after 633 Penda killed two East Anglian kings, Sigebert and Egric, in battle. He set up a vassal king in East Anglia. About 635 Penda's brother Eowa became a king in Mercia along with Penda. Possibly he ruled northern Mercia while Penda ruled in the south. In Cadwallon, Penda's ally, was defeated and killed by King Oswald of Northumbria. The armies of Oswald and Penda met in 641 at Maserfelth (later called Oswestry in Shropshire). What events led to the battle is not recorded. Penda defeated and killed Oswald. This left Penda the most powerful king in England. Nothing indicates that Penda claimed to be overlord however. In 643 Cenwalh succeeded Cynegils as king of Wessex. Cenwalh married a sister of Penda of Mercia. But in 645 when Cenwalh her (set her aside) in favor of another wife, Penda invaded Wessex. Penda drove Cenwalh into exile in East Anglia. While in exile, Wulfhere, the son of Penda, took a great deal of territory away from Wessex. He gave the Isle of Wight to Aethelwalh, King of Sussex. Cenwalh returned to his kingdom . In 650, possibly to teach him a lesson for sheltering Cenwalh, Penda drove King Anna of East Anglia out of his kingdom. Penda killed Anna in battle in .
After King Oswald's death, Northumbria divided back into the two previous kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. Each had their own king. Oswiu of Northumbria became king of Bernicia. He was Oswald's brother and Penda had a particular contempt for him. In 653 Deira came under Mercian control. In 654, hoping to put an end to Oswiu, Penda gathered all his allies and invaded Bernicia. Called the battle of the Winwaed he marched against Oswiu with 'thirty legions'. On Sunday, 15 November 655 the two armies met in battle near Leads. Although he had the larger army Penda was killed.

P. G. T. Beauregard

Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard (May 28, 1818 – February 20, 1893) was an American military officer, politician, inventor, writer, civil servant. He was the first prominent general of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Today, he is known as P. G. T. Beauregard, but he rarely used his first name as an adult.
Beauregard was born on May 28, 1818 in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. He was raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. Beauregard studied at the United States Military Academy. 
After the South seceded, he resigned from the US Army and became the first Confederate brigadier general. He commanded the defenses of Charleston, South Carolina, at the start of the Civil War at Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861. Three months later he won the First Battle of Bull Run near Manassas, Virginia.
Beauregard was married to Marie Antoinette Laure Villeré from 1841 until her death in 1850 after giving birth to their third child. They had three children, René, Henri, and Laure. Then he was married to Caroline Deslonde from 1860 until her death in 1894. They had no children.
Following his military career, Beauregard returned to Louisiana, where he served as a railroad executive. He became wealthy because of his role in creating the Louisiana Lottery.
Beauregard died on February 20, 1893 in his sleep from heart disease in his New Orleans, Louisiana home. He was 74 years old. He was buried at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Ken Hechler

Kenneth William "Ken" Hechler (September 20, 1914 – December 10, 2016) was an American politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he represented West Virginia in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1959 to 1977. Hechler was the West Virginia Secretary of State from 1985 to 2001. He was currently the oldest living person to have served in the United States Congress.
Hechler was born in Roslyn, New York on September 20, 1914. He studied at Swarthmore College and later attended Columbia University.
Hechler faced a close race for the first (and as it turned out, only) time in 1972. Following the 1970 Census, West Virginia's population was low. The state legislature merged Hechler's district with most of the old 5th District, comprising several coal-mining counties around Bluefield and Beckley. 
The 5th had been represented by Democrat James Kee of Bluefield since 1965, and members of his family had held the district continuously since 1933. On paper, the new district favored Kee, who retained 65 percent of his former territory. However, Hechler routed him in the Democratic primary by almost 26 points and easily won reelection in November. He was reelected in 1974 after being unopposed in the primary and general election.
In 1976, he entered a multi-candidate primary for governor, but lost that statewide race by a large margin. In 1984 he ran for West Virginia Secretary of State and won. He was re-elected in 1988, 1992, and 1996. n 1990, he again ran, in the middle of his Secretarial term, for his old Congressional seat, but was defeated by Rahall in the primary. In 2004 he ran yet again for his old post as Secretary of State. This time, he won the Democratic primary by a plurality, but lost the general election to Republican Betty Ireland.
Since 2004, Hechler has campaigned against mountaintop removal mining. On June 23, 2009, Hechler, then aged 94, participated in a protest near mountaintop removal mining sites in the West Virginia coalfields in the Coal River Valley along with others. He was one of 29 protesters arrested for trespass.
Hechler died under hospice care in Romney, West Virginia on December 10, 2016 from a stroke, aged 102.

Marrella splendens is an arthropod known from the middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia. It is the most common animal in the Burgess Shale.
"Marrella" was the first fossil collected by Charles Doolittle Walcott from the Burgess Shale, in 1909. Walcott described "Marrella" informally as a "lace crab" and described it more formally as an odd trilobite. In 1971, Whittington did a thorough redescription of the animal. On the basis of its legs, gills and head appendages, he decided that it was not a trilobite, nor a chelicerate, nor a crustacean.
"Marrella"-like organisms are found in other Cambrian deposits. They are known from sediments as late as the Devonian.

Vocaloid

Vocaloid is a music software that's used to make vocals for music. It was created by Yamaha, a company that sells musical instruments, as well as other products. The user can type in lyrics and a melody and it will synthesize singing. Voicebanks for Vocaloid are made by recording samples of singers.
Vocaloid was developed partially through a research project led by Kenmochi Hideki. The people involved in this project later created the company Voctro Labs. Vocaloid was originally not supposed to be a commercial product, but with the help of Yamaha, became the program we know today.
Vocaloid originally only had an English version available, with two English voicebanks, Leon and Lola, being released for it. This changed later on with the release of Kaito and Meiko, which were both Japanese voicebanks.
Vocaloid is meant both for professional and amateur music makers, since Vocaloid is easy to use, so the only limit is the user's skill. Music groups like Livetune and Supercell have made music using Vocaloid voicebanks.
Vocaloid works by taking samples of singers and separating them into parts. These parts are used to form words. Vocaloid voices can be made to sound more realistic by using vibrato and changing things like how breathy a voice sounds.
Yamaha started working on Vocaloid in 2000. They announced it at a German music festival. Vocaloid was originally nicknamed "Daisy" as a reference to the song "Daisy Bell", but eventually they got rid of that name and decided to use "Vocaloid" instead.
Vocaloid 2 was announced in 2007. The way vocals were synthesized was changed, and so was the way the program looked.
Vocaloid 3 was released on October 21st, 2011. A lot of companies that made voicebanks for Vocaloid 2 upgraded their voicebanks to Vocaloid 3 because it sounded better.
Vocaloid 4 was released in 2015, and added a feature which let voicebanks made specifically for Vocaloid 4 sound like they were growling.

Seid or Seiðr is an Old Norse word for a kind of sorcery which was practised in Norse society. It is connected with Norse religion. No one knows were seid came from. It was practiced less with the spread of Christianity in Scandinavia. The practice was recorded in Norse stories (sagas) found by archeologists. Many scholars say that seid was like shamanism.
Both male and female Scandinavians practiced this form of magic. By doing so, they were often persecuted by society because they brought a taboo on themselves.
In pre-Christian Norse mythology, seid was associated with the god Odin, their god of war, poetry and sorcery. It was also associated with the goddess Freyja, who was their goddess of love and fertility.
Today, followers of modern paganism adopted forms of magic that they called seid. Their practices have since been studied by many researchers in the field of pagan studies.

Women in Ancient Greece

The status of women in ancient Greece varied form city state to city state. Women in ancient Delphi, Gortyn, Thessaly, Megara and Sparta could own land, which was the most prestigious form of private property at the time.
In ancient Athens, women were not citizens. Until marriage, women were under the guardianship of their father or other male relative. After marriage, their husband ("kyrios") acted for the wife in all legal matters. Athenian women had limited property rights. Athenian women could enter into a contract worth less than the value of a “medimnos of barley” (a measure of grain). This allowed women to engage in petty trading. 
Slaves, like free women, were not eligible for full citizenship in ancient Athens, but sometimes, rarely, they could become citizens if freed. Women, on the other hand, could never get full civil rights. No women ever acquired citizenship in ancient Athens, and so they were excluded from ancient Athenian democracy.
By contrast, Spartan women enjoyed a status, power, and respect that was unknown in the rest of the classical world. Although Spartan women were formally excluded from military and political life they enjoyed considerable status as mothers of Spartan warriors. As men engaged in military activity, women took responsibility for running estates. 
After many years of war in the 4th century BC, Spartan women owned between 35% and 40% of all Spartan land and property. By the Hellenistic period, some of the wealthiest Spartans were women. They controlled their own properties, as well as the properties of male relatives who were away with the army. Unlike Athenian women who wore heavy, concealing clothes and were rarely seen outside the house, Spartan women wore short dresses and went where they pleased. Spartan women rarely married before the age of 20: this was unusual in the ancient world. Girls as well as boys received an education, and young women as well as young men may have joined in the "Gymnopaedia" ("Festival of Nude Youths").
Some philosophers were in favour of equality for women, but not Plato and Aristotle. Contrary to them, the Stoic philosophers argued for the equality of the sexes. In their view, sexual inequality was contrary to the laws of nature. In doing so, they followed the Cynics, who argued that men and women should wear the same clothing and get the same kind of education. They also saw marriage as a moral companionship between equals rather than a biological or social necessity. The Cynics practiced these views in their lives as well as in their teachings. The Stoics adopted the views of the Cynics and added them to their own theories of human nature, thus putting their sexual egalitarianism on a strong footing.

The calendar was created by the Báb and refined by Bahá'u'lláh and the Universal House of Justice. 
Each year starts on "Naw-Rúz", the vernal equinox (in March), and has 19 months. Each month has 19 days. An extra 4 or 5 days are added between the last two months so that the next year also starts on the equinox. Each day begins at sunset. The time of sunset and the time of the equinox are calculated by astronomers. 
The months are known by their Arabic names. The days within each month also use the same names. Here they are with their usual English translations:
Each group of 19 years is called a Váhid. 
Each group of 19 Váhids is called a Kull-i-Shay’.
Year 1 of the Badí' calendar started at Naw-Rúz in 1844 A.D.

Non-coding RNA

A non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is a functional RNA molecule which is not translated into a protein. Less-used synonyms are non-protein-coding RNA (npcRNA), non-messenger RNA (nmRNA) and functional RNA (fRNA). The term small RNA (sRNA) is often used for short bacterial ncRNAs. The DNA sequence from which a non-coding RNA is transcribed is often called an 'RNA gene'.
Non-coding RNA genes include abundant and important RNAs such as transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA); also RNAs such as snoRNAs, microRNAs, siRNAs, snRNAs, exRNAs, and piRNAs and the long noncoding RNAs (long ncRNAs). The number of ncRNAs in the human genome is unknown. However recent studies suggest the existence of thousands of ncRNAs. Since the function of newly identified ncRNAs has not been proved, it is possible that many are non-functional.
The first non-coding RNA to be analysed was an alanine tRNA found in baker's yeast. Its structure was published in 1965.

Handicap principle

The handicap principle was invented by Prof. Amotz Zahavi from Tel Aviv University. It claims to explain the fact that some animals have characteristics that do not necessarily help them survive. Let's take the peacock for example. The peacock's tail is long and heavy and actually diminishes its chances to survive. So why did it evolutionarily survive? According to the principle, one day, a mutant peahen that likes peacocks with longer tail, looked for a male with this characteristic. The mature male she found was strong enough to survive even though it had a long tail and therefore it is probably stronger than the average peacock. Therefore, its predecessor males are going to be stronger and also to have a long tail while the newborn females are going to like long tails, passing the ideals of the principle to the next generations.
This principle comes in addition to the well-known adaptation part of evolution theory claiming that the one who fits best to its environment survives.

GD 61 is a white dwarf star. It is 150 light-years from Earth in the constellation Perseus.
An asteroid in the system was detected in 2013 that contains water. This was the first finding of solid or liquid water on an extrasolar body. The asteroid, the first extrasolar asteroid detected, is 26% water by mass, close to the water content of Ceres. This means that a planet, with a rocky surface similar to Earth's, may have existed in the past. The asteroid could be an artifact from this period. It is now possibly part of a debris field from that planet's breakup. Such a planet would have had both a rocky surface and water. These are two key ingredients for life. The researchers used the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope to determine what it is made of. The elements magnesium, silicon, iron and oxygen were detected. These are all components of rocky planets. However, the amount of oxygen is much higher than what was expected. There was also less carbon than expected. This meant there was one possible reason for the extra oxygen. There had to be water there.

Pilgrim of Eternity

"Pilgrim of Eternity" is an episode of "Star Trek" that was created by fans. It was released in 2013. It is the first in a planned web series, "Star Trek Continues". It is a sequel to the original series episode, "Who Mourns for Adonais?".
The crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise are looking into mysterious energy drains from power stations. They find an alien artifact, which begins to draw power from the ship. They destroy the artifact to save themselves, just after Spock (played by Todd Haberkorn) detects two life forms on it. The two forms then materialize on the bridge. one of them is the alien known in Earth's history as the Greek god Apollo (played by Michael Forest). The crew had met him only a couple of years earlier, but he has now aged. He says he was exposed to the energy draining properties of the Realm. This was the destroyed structure. It was built by his race to live in forever. It had malfunctioned and killed all the others of his race. He says he no longer wishes to have people worship him again. After a brief stay in the sick-bay, He starts to want people to idolize him for his singing and storytelling. Captain Kirk (played by Vic Mignogna) demands to speak with him about his behaviors. Apollo uses his telekinetic powers on the captain and others to make them worship him. Meanwhile, the remains of the Realm are still causing difficulties. A crew member dies while he and Sulu (played by Grant Imahara of "Mythbusters") are removing debris from the hull of the Enterprise.
Unlike other Star Trek fan productions, "Pilgrim" had a lead crew made up of film industry professionals. The creators attempted to recreate the style of the original series, in its sets, cinematography, costumes, and acting and storytelling style. They duplicated the dramatic pauses as used in the original, prior to commercial breaks. They primarily used the original series' incidental music, as well as the original theme song and iconic credit typography. They filmed in 4:3 aspect ratio to duplicate the original series' TV format.
Actor Michael Forest, in his 80's during filming, was written into the story as having been artificially aged, as he was supposed to have last encountered the crew of the Enterprise only a few years prior, according to the original series timeline.
As with all such Star Trek fan productions, permission to use copyrighted and trademarked properties from the original series are allowed so long as the production is not-for-profit.
The episode was first shown to the public at the Phoenix Comicon comic book convention on May 26, 2013, and was at the same time released onto the internet, on various streaming services.
Funds for continuation of the series are being raised in part from a Kickstarter campaign, held from Oct 7, 2013 - Nov 6, 2013, which has raised the set goal of $100,000. A second episode in the series, to be directed by Chris White, was in production as of October 2013.

Alternator

An alternator is a generator which converts mechanical energy to electrical energy in the form of alternating current. There is one in every car.
Most alternators use a rotating magnetic field with a stationary armature. The armature reacts to the rotating field and carries the current caused by the rotation. 
In principle, any AC electrical generator can be called an alternator, but usually the term refers to small rotating machines driven by automotive and other internal combustion engines. 
An alternator that uses a permanent magnet for its magnetic field is called a magneto. Alternators in power stations driven by steam turbines are called turbo-alternators.
Alternating current generating systems were known from the discovery of the magnetic induction of electric current. The early machines were developed by pioneers such as Michael Faraday and Hippolyte Pixii.

Herman Kahn

Herman Kahn (February 15, 1922 – July 7, 1983) was one of the preeminent futurists of the second half of the twentieth century. His theories helped to develop the nuclear strategy of the United States.
Kahn, a man of "captivating personality and large intellectual gifts", worked for the RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California, as a military strategist (19481958). He was a founder of the Hudson Institute think tank. This gives ideas and consultations for the U.S. government and military chiefs, and for business clients. 
He was known for analyzing the likely consequences of nuclear war and recommending ways to improve survivability. His key idea was that the threat of nuclear war could be controlled by the use of carefully graded deterrence. In order to get his ideas across he ran two-day seminars which included role-playing in various scenarios. His ideas, when published in "On Thermonuclear War", caused a sensation. 
However, responses must be proportionate, because if one threatened all-out war as a response for some rather modest misbehaviour, then the threat was simply not believable, and would not work. The need to think things through in detail was the topic of his second book, "Thinking about the Unthinkable".
Kahn was less successful later in his career when he turned his attention to general economics and politics. His ideas on Japan seemed good at the time, but now seem to be quite wrong. He predicted that Japan would become the world's third superstate and a military superpower. This he based on Japan's record after 1946, which was spectacular, based mainly on quality production and undercutting markets in the older economies. As it turned out, Japan's economy stalled in the 1980s, and has never recovered its previous growth rate. The role he predicted for Japan is now filled by China, a country with a huge reserve of poorly-paid workers and significant military forces.
Works written by Kahn include:

Unlike previous "Arkham" games, "Arkham Origins" is not made by Rocksteady Studios. It is also written by Dooma Wendschuh and Corey May. The main story takes place five years before the events of 2009's "Batman: Arkham Asylum". The game shows a younger and not entirely formed Batman who has a bounty placed on his head by crime lord Black Mask. This attracts eight of world's greatest assassins to Gotham City on Christmas Eve. While having to deal with the dirty members of the police department, other villains also attract Batman's attention. Like previous "Arkham" games, "Arkham Origins" is played from the third-person view. The game greatly focuses on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and use of gadgets. "Arkham Origins" is the first game in the series to have a multiplayer mode.
The game mainly got positive reviews. But it was slammed for copying material from previous "Arkham" games without improvement, or pointlessly changing it. A tie-in game titled "Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate" was released along with "Arkham Origins". "Origins Blackgate" is available for Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita. A mobile version of "Arkham Origins" was created for iOS and Android systems. The mobile version was made available for download in October 2013.

<doc id="423197" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=423197" title="Enhanced geothermal system">
Enhanced geothermal system

An enhanced geothermal system (EGS) is a geothermal energy system that can make electrical energy when natural underground water is not there. For a long time, geothermal energy could only be produced when there were hot rocks, underground water, and cracks in rocks all together in one area. Now, new ways of getting this power source are being created. Areas that can possibly be used for energy need to be altered by people to make the energy usable. These areas may need either underground water and/or cracks, or fracture network, in rocks. Enhanced geothermal systems allow for geothermal energy to be outside normal geothermal areas like active plate boundaries to less active areas like the western United States.
Geothermal systems can also be enhanced by recycling old oil and gas wells for geothermal use. It is cheaper to change these wells for heat mining than to drill new holes. These wells do not allow for physical contact between the water and the heat source. These wells are made out of two cylinders: a bigger one and a smaller one. The smaller one fits inside the bigger one and is where the heated water is pumped out from. Water in inserted between the lining of the inner pipe and the outer one. Due to the lack in direct contact with the hot rocks as well as some heat loss from lack of a good insulating material, the energy output is not as high as in ordinary geothermal systems.
Some say that this form of energy is one of the “greenest” alternative energies out there. Studies that say two of the three ways of geothermal energy production is flash-steam and dry-steam give off less than 7% of the green house gasses that fossil fuels give off. The third method, known as a closed binary-cycle system, gives off nearly zero green house gasses.) The most emission heavy part of EGS is when the drills are powered by diesel fuel. Research on EGS Life Cycle Analysis has shown that a good correction for this would be to hook the drill up to the power grid decreasing the already minimal impact GEP power plants has on human health, climate change, and ecosystem quality. Supporters also claim that because geothermal energy systems don’t rely on the changing weather, it is a more reliable energy with a constant energy output.
The US has the largest potential geothermal energy reserve in the world yet only 4% of its total energy usage (15 billion kWh) is from GEP. California has the highest number of geothermal heat pumps out of a total of the nine states that use geothermal energy. Hawaii gets 20% of its power from geothermal power plants. Knowledge about geothermal energy is not well known. This makes getting money for research and development very hard. Developers have also been known to have trouble getting permits to drill on public land and get funding from both the federal government and outside interests. There are, however, two projects that were approved by the Senate to help get EGS out of the pilot stage.
In 1990, legislation took to creating incentives to develop the industry. It was attempted with the Energy Act of 2005 and Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 with issued tax credits and the creation of Senate supported research and development programs.

Wulfhere of Mercia

Wulfhere or Wulfar ( 675) was an early King of Mercia. Although his father was pagan Wulfhere was a Christian. His older brother Peada ruled Mercia south of the River Thames under Oswiu of Northumbria. When Peada was murdered Oswiu held Mercia until the ealdormen of Mercia rebelled and placed Wulfhere on the throne. Wulfhere ruled Mercia from 658 until his death. He was the first Mercian (overlord) of England. 
Wulfhere was a younger son of King Penda. His older brother Peada accepted Christianity to marry the daughter of King Oswiu of Northumbria. After their father was killed by Oswiu, Peada was set up as a king of southern Mercia. Peada's wife murdered him within five months. Oswiu then took control of all Mercia and ruled it three years. The Mercian ealdormen Immin, Eafa and Eadbert rose up in rebellion against king Oswiu. Wulfhere, who had been kept hidden, was then proclaimed king. Wulfhere had little opposition from Oswiu as he was dealing with a rebellion in Northumbria. Wulfhere began building alliances with other kings in the south of England. His first may have been in about 660 when he married Ermenilda, the daughter of King Eorcenberht of Kent and his wife Seaxburh. About this same time he expanded Mercia to the west. He brought Shropshire and Herfordshire under his control. The kings of Essex submitted to his rule by 665.
By the time Oswiu died in 670 Wulfhere was the overlord of most of southern England. He installed Bishop Wine in London after he was expelled from Wessex by king Cenwalh. While Wulfhere did not directly control East Anglia he controlled Lindsey and Essex. By controlling all the surrounding lands, he probably forced East Anglia into a treaty. Wulfhere then made Athelwalh recognize his overlordship in Sussex. He expelled the West Saxons from Sussex and eastern Hampshire. Expanding to the east he made his Frithuwold King of Surrey in 670. When King Ecgberht of Kent died in 673 Wulfhere became the guardian of his two sons Eadric and Wihtred. He then ruled Kent through them. With Wulfhere's support, Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury presided over the Synod of Hertford in 673. In 674 Wulfhere decided to attack Northumbria. Oswiu's son Ecgfrith of Northumbria had put down a rebellion by the Picts when he became king. Wulfhere formed an alliance of most of the southern kings with the exception of Wessex. The southern alliance under Wulfhere was defeated by Ecgfrith in battle. While Wulfhere survived he was forced to pay to Ecgfrith. He soon lost his authority in Kent. Possibly in revenge for not joining him in fighting Northumbria, Wulfhere attacked Wessex. He was defeated by King Aescwine of Wessex in 674. Wulfhere died in early 675. He was succeeded as king by his brother Aethelred.
By his wife Ermenilda, he had:

Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan

On June 5, 2004, Ronald Reagan, the 40th President of the United States, died after having suffered from Alzheimer's disease for almost 10 years. A seven-day state funeral for Reagan was held shortly after his death. 
After Reagan's death his body was taken from his Bel Air, Los Angeles, California home to the Gates, Kingsley and Gates Funeral Home in Santa Monica, California to prepare the body for burial. On June 7, Reagan's casket was taken by a hearse. The funeral was performed by the Reagan's Presbyterian minister Michael Wenning.
It was displayed at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, then flown to Washington, D.C. on June 9 for a service, public viewing and tributes at the U.S. Capitol.
After lying in state for thirty-four hours in the Capitol Rotunda, a state funeral service was held at the Washington National Cathedral on June 11. 
On the same day, President George W. Bush declared a national day of mourning. Bush was in Paris when Reagan died. Later that day, after the service, Reagan's casket was taken back to California for burial at the Reagan Presidential Library. Bush later said the following during his press-conference in Paris: 
The state funeral was the first since the funeral of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1973. Richard Nixon, who lead over Johnson's funeral, declined to have a state funeral in 1994. The state funeral was the first time that Washington hosted a major event since the September 11 attacks.
About 4,000 people gathered at the cathedral for the service, including President and Mrs. Bush, former president George H. W. and Barbara Bush, Gerald and Betty Ford, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, and Bill and Hillary Clinton. Members of Congress, such as Dick Cheney, Howard Baker, Sandra Day O'Connor, and Dennis Hastert, and past and present governors were also present.

Battle of Long Island

The Battle of Long Island was a major battle in the American war of independence. It is also known as the Battle of Brooklyn or the Battle of Brooklyn Heights. The battle which was fought on August 27, 1776, was a major victory for the British and defeat for the Americans under General George Washington. It was the start of a successful British campaign that gave the British control of the strategically important city of New York. In the American Revolutionary War it was the first major battle to take place after the United States declared independence in July, 1776. In terms of soldiers, it was the largest battle of the entire conflict.
General George Washington, Commander-in-Chief had defeated the British in the Siege of Boston on March 17, 1776. Washington then used the Continental Army to defend the port city of New York. At that time, New York City was only at the southern end of Manhattan Island. Washington understood that the city's harbor would provide an excellent base for the British Navy during the campaign. For this reason, he established defenses there and waited for the British to attack.
The British were commanded by General William Howe. In July, his force landed a few miles across the harbor on sparsely-populated Staten Island. Over the next few months, new ships slowly reinforced their position in Lower New York Bay. In August there were 32,000 soldiers, and the British controlled the entrance of the harbor at The Narrows. Washington knew that it would be difficult to hold the city against such a force. He believed Manhattan would be the first target and he moved most of his forces there.
On August 22, the British landed on the shores of Gravesend Bay in southwest Kings County, across The Narrows from Staten Island, more than 12 miles (20 km) south from the East River crossings to Manhattan. After five days of waiting, the British attacked American defenses on the Guan Heights. Unknown to the Americans, however, Howe had brought his main army around their rear and attacked their flank soon after. The Americans panicked, although a stand by 400 Maryland troops prevented most of the army from being captured. The remainder of the army fled to the main defenses on Brooklyn Heights. The British dug in for a siege but, on the night of August 29–30, Washington evacuated the entire army to Manhattan without the loss of materiel or a single life. Washington and the Continental Army were driven out of New York entirely after several more defeats and forced to retreat through New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.

Siouxsie and the Banshees were an English rock band. They were started in 1976 in Bromley, London by Siouxsie Sioux and Steven Severin. They met at a Roxy Music concert the year before. The band broke up in 1996. They later performed together again in 2002 for a tour. They released 11 studio albums between 1978 and 1995. Their most popular song in the UK was "Dear Prudence", a Beatles cover. It reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. They were less popular in the United States, but their 1991 single "Kiss Them For Me" reached 23 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. They were also the second headliners for the first Lollapalooza. 
The group played their first concert at the 100 Club Punk Festival. Sid Vicious played drums. Marco Pirroni played guitar. Without practising beforehand, they did a twenty-minute improvised version of the Lord's Prayer. The band had no name and was going to break up after the concert, but they were asked to play again. 
Two months later Kenny Morris joined as a drummer and Peter Fenton as a guitarist. After a few performances, the band realized that Fenton didn't fit in and John McKay took his place. 
In 1978, the band were signed to Polydor Records. They released their first single "Hong Kong Garden". It reached 7 on the UK Singles Chart. They released their first album, "The Scream", in November. It reached number 12 in the UK Albums Chart. It got mostly good reviews. "Sounds" said it was "the best debut album of the year".
Robert Smith was guitarist in the band's 1979 tour for "Join Hands". He joined the group again in 1982 to replace John McGeoch. He left in 1984 because he said that being in two bands at once was too much stress. He was replaced by John "Valentine" Carruthers. Before he left he wanted his time with the band to be documented, so the band released a cover of the Beatles' "Dear Prudence" with Smith on guitar. 
Peter Edward Clark, known as Budgie, also joined the band for the "Join Hands" tour. He stayed a member until the band broke up. In 1987 Carruthers left and was replaced with Jon Klein. Martin McCarrick became the band's full time keyboard player. 
In 1987, the band released "Through the Looking Glass", an album of covers of songs by other musicians.
Between January and June 1988, the band recorded their ninth album, "Peepshow". It was released on 5 September 1988. It had a more pop sound than their previous albums. It got very good reviews. "Q" gave it 5 stars. 
In 1991, "Superstition", the Banshees' tenth album, was released. The single "Kiss Them for Me" became their biggest US hit. 
In 1995, they released their last album, "The Rapture". A few weeks later, Polydor dropped them from their label. Guitarist Klein was replaced with Knox Chandler for the band's last tour.

Selfishness

Selfishness is having more concern for yourself than for others. It is caring, through thoughts or actions, more about your own needs than the needs and well-being of other people. It may be accompanied by a lack of empathy. Selfishness is the opposite of selflessness. It is also different, though related, to self-centredness and self-affirmation. Many psychologists approve of a healthy level of selfishness, in order for some people to stay happy.
In the study of ethics and morality, selfishness is usually considered bad. In contrast, acts of selflessness are praised. Wider debate about it, however, such as in philosophy, psychology and economics, has shown that scholars have had many different opinions about its value and consequences. In most major religions, selfishness is considered an immoral or bad habit. In Christianity, it is associated with pride, often considered the worst of the Seven deadly sins. Aristotle condemned men who would only try to profit themselves; but he approved of those who would try to gain the praise from others that he deserved.

List of monarchs of Mercia

The Kingdom of Mercia was an important monarchy in the English Midlands from the 6th century to the 10th. From the mid-7th century until it ceased to exist as a kingdom, Mercia was the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Some of its rulers were the first to claim titles such as "King of the English" and "King of Britain". Mercia was one of the seven kingdoms of the . This is a later name given to the seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England during the early Middle Ages. Besides Mercia it included Northumbria, Wessex, East Anglia, Essex, Kent, and Sussex.
The first of Mercian kings are called the Iclingas. The name comes from Icel who ruled the Mercians . Members of this dynasty claimed to be descendants the royal family of their homeland in Western Europe. Mercia became a dominant force under Penda from about until his death in 655. Bretwalda, his son, was the first Mercian overlord of the southern English. Offa (757–796), was the first of the Anglo-Saxon kings who might rightly be called "king of the English". Mercia was never again as powerful as it was during Offa's reign. For their successors in England see List of English monarchs.
When the Iclingas line died out in the male line, members of other noble Mercian families competed for the throne. The 'B' dynasty is for kings Beornwulf, Berhtwulf and Burgred. The 'W' dynasty is for king Wiglaf. Others have no dynasty they are connected with.
After being defeated by Alfred the Great, the king of Wessex, the rulers were no longer considered kings and queens but rather ealdormen. The title of the female rulers was "Lady of the Mercians." They were styled Kings and Queens in Mercia only.
After Mercia became an annex of Wessex (Mercia was no longer a kingdom), 'King of Mercia' became a title only.

Lythronax is a newly-discovered extinct genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur. It lived about 80 million years ago (mya) in what is now southern Utah. "L. argestes" is the oldest known tyrannosaurid based on its stratigraphic position.
Comparisons to its close relatives suggest that "Lythronax" would have been about long, with a weight of around and had a large skull filled with sharp teeth. 
The rostrum is comparatively short: it makes up less than two thirds of the total skull length. The whole skull is very broad, 0.4 times as wide as long. Overall, the skull is similar to that of "Tyrannosaurus" and "Tarbosaurus". Its robust jaws have two sizes of teeth: its first five teeth are much larger than the other six. Behind the skull, the rest of the skeleton is similar to that of other tyrannosaurids.

RAND Corporation

The RAND Corporation is a nonprofit global policy think tank first formed to offer research and analysis to the United States Armed Forces by Douglas Aircraft Company. 
The RAND was started in 1946 inside the Douglas Aircraft Company, and was set up as an independent corporation in 1948. The name was taken from R&D (research and development), though in fact it did no development. 
It is currently financed by the U.S. government and private endowment, corporations, the healthcare industry, universities, and private individuals. 
The organization now works with other governments, private foundations, international organizations, and commercial organizations on a host of non-defence issues. RAND techniques were based on operations research (O.R). which started in World War II. O.R. is the interdisciplinary application of scientific thinking to problem-solving. It relies mostly on the hard sciences like physics and mathematics, and economics. However, some famous biologists and social scientists have worked with RAND at times, and the importance of social ideas and thinking is more important than ever today.
RAND has about 1,700 employees and three principal North American locations: Santa Monica, California (headquarters); Arlington, Virginia; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The RAND Gulf States Policy Institute has offices in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi. RAND Europe is located in Cambridge, England, and Brussels, Belgium. The RAND-Qatar Policy Institute is in Doha, Qatar. RAND's newest office is in Boston, Massachusetts.
RAND is also home to the Pardee RAND School, which is the world's largest Ph.D.-granting program in policy analysis. Unlike many other universities, all PARDEE RAND Graduate School students receive fellowships in order to cover their education costs. RAND also offers a number of internship and fellowship programs allowing students and outsiders to assist in conducting research for RAND projects. Most of these projects are short-term and are worked on independently with the mentoring of a RAND staff members.
RAND publishes the "RAND Journal of Economics", a peer-reviewed journal of economics.
To date, 32 recipients of the Nobel Prize, primarily in the fields of economics and physics, have been involved or associated with RAND at some point in their career.

Guennol Lioness

The Guennol Lioness is a 5,000-year-old Mesopotamian statue found near Baghdad, Iraq. It shows the form of a muscular anthropomorphic lioness-woman.
The sculpture sold for $57.2 million at Sotheby's auction house on December 5, 2007. The sculpture was on loan to the Brooklyn Museum of Art until it was purchased at auction by an English collector. 
The limestone sculpture is just over 8 cm (3.25 in) tall. It was described by Sotheby's as "one of the last known masterworks from the dawn of civilization remaining in private hands". One day before the auction, experts had been estimating that the highest bid would be between $14 million and $18 million.
At the time of its 2007 sale, the price paid at auction for the Guennol Lioness was the highest paid for a sculpture to that date. It easily exceeded the record of Pablo Picasso's "Tete de femme (Dora Maar)". On 3 February 2010, however, the second edition of the cast of the sculpture "L'Homme qui marche I" (Walking Man I) by Alberto Giacometti sold for £65,001,250 ($104,327,006) and overtook the Guennol Lioness as the most expensive sculpture ever sold at auction.
This lioness-woman sculpture is an Elamite figure believed to have been created about 3000–2800 B.C. Its historical significance is that it was made about the same time as the first known use of the wheel, the development of cuneiform writing, and the emergence of the first cities.
Many ancient Near East deities were represented as anthropomorphic figures. Such images evoked the Mesopotamian belief in attaining power over the physical world by combining the superior physical attributes of various species. It is possible that the nearby Sumerians borrowed this powerful artistic hybrid from the Proto-Elamites. The lioness was the frequent subject of veneration among cultures familiar with the well-coordinated hunting of female lions.

Aethelred I of Mercia

Aethelred, also Æthelred or Ethelred, ( 716) was an early King of Mercia. He succeeded his brother Wulfhere when he died in 675. Like his brother, Wulfhere, he was considered an overlord over other English kings. But he never reached the same political status as Wulfhere. His importance was in his contributions to the church. Aethelred ruled Mercia until his in 704. He stepped down to retire to the monastery at Bardney.
Aethelred was a son of King Penda. At about the same time he succeeded his brother to the throne he married Osthryth, daughter of Oswiu of Northumbria. Aethelred attacked Kent in 676 to get Hlothhere of Kent back in line as a vassal of Mercia. He destroyed much of that kingdom as well as sacked Rochester. In 679 Aethelred continued the struggle his father and brother had with Northumbria. He found Ecgfrith of Northumbria waiting for him on the River Trent which divided north and south Mercia. In the battle, Aelfwine, the younger brother of King Ecgfrith was killed and the Northumbrians were defeated. To prevent a blood feud between the two royal families, Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury stepped in to prevent further bloodshed. He secured a truce between Northumbria and Mercia that lasted for 50 years. For the rest of his reign Aethelred was respected as overlord of England even though Bede never listed him among the seven .
Aethelred was very involved in the church. He and his wife Osthryth founded Bardney abbey in Lindsey. Queen Osthryth had the bones of her uncle, Oswald of Northumbria, brought to Bardney to be buried there. This caused some resentment by the monks who at first refused to accept his bones. But they were accepted and buried in the church with all the honors due a saint. Aethelred was a close friend of Wilfrid of York. In 691 Aethelred gave the bishop sanctuary in Mercia after his exile from Northumbria. While welcomed by Aethelred he was not by Queen Osthryth. Wilfred was an old enemy of her brother king Ecgfrith of Northumbria. But Ostryth was not completely accepted in Mercia. She created the cult of Saint Oswald in Mercia which did little to help Mercians forget old feuds with Northumbria. In 697, Queen Osthryth was murdered by Mercian noblemen. She was suspected of having some part in the murder of Peada forty years earlier. By this time she had become a nun and had given up married life. In 704 Aethelred stepped down as king to become a monk. His nephew Cenred became King after him. Aethelred retired to the monastery of Bardney where his wife Osthryth had been buried. He became the abbot of Bardney although he remained aware of Mercian politics. Two years after giving up the throne he called his nephew, King Cenred, to Bardsley to ask him to remain on good terms with his old friend Bishop Wilfrid. Aethelred died in 716.
Athelred married Ostryth of Northumbria. Athelred may have married a second time. He had two known children but by which wife is uncertain:

Óðr

In Norse mythology, Óðr (sometimes written in English as Odr or Od) is a man associated with the goddess Freyja. The "Prose Edda" and "Heimskringla", both by Snorri Sturluson, describe Óðr as Freyja's husband. They also describe him as the father of Freyja's daughter Hnoss. "Heimskringla" adds that the couple had another daughter together, Gersemi.
Not much else is written about Óðr, except that he often went away on long journeys. Freyja wept when she missed him. Several scholars have suggested that Óðr may just have been another name for the god Odin.

First Jewish–Roman War

The First Jewish–Roman War, or The Great Revolt was the first of three major uprisings of Jews in the Judaea provice against the Roman Empire. It happened from 66–70 AD, and ended with the Empire winnng.
The Great Revolt was the first of three wars in Judea against the Roman Empire. It began in 66 AD in Caesarea due to religious tension between the Greek and Jewish population. It became, however, an anti-taxation protest against Rome. In Caesarea, the Greeks sacrificed animals in front of a Jewish Synagogue which resulted in the Jews ceasing sacrifices to the Emperor of Rome. General Gallus went up against the rebels and lost a crucial battle Beth Horon in 68 AD.
After this defeat, Emperor Nero replaced Gallus with Vespasian. He ended up swiftly crushing the Northern and Southern leadership and the rebellion began to fall apart. Later that year, Nero was deposed. The Roman forces besieged Jerusalem and breached the walls by 70 AD. Once they got into the walls, the Roman soldiers burned and ransacked the city also destroying the Second Temple. The final stronghold at Masada was taken in 73 AD and when the Roman soldiers broke through the defences, they discovered all the defenders had committed suicide. As a result, most of the Jews in the area were scattered or sold into slavery. The final death toll, according to Josephus, was over one million.

When Counsel Joseph Ball asked Leavelle if he had ever spoken to Oswald before this interrogation, he stated; "No; I had never talked to him before". Leavelle then stated during his testimony that; "...the only time I had connections with Oswald was this Sunday morning [November 24, 1963]. I never had [the] occasion to talk with him at any time..." 
Leavelle believes that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy, and said that in a 2006 discussion, he was told by Oswald's brother Robert that he believes the same thing, "because I knew my brother."

During his time competing in the United States, Goodish was involved in feuds with the likes of Kamala the Ugandan Giant, Abdullah the Butcher, and Jerry Blackwell. During his time in Japan, he tag teamed with Stan Hansen.
On July 16, 1988, before his match with Dan Spivey in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, Goodish was told to go into the shower by fellow wrestler and booker, José Huertas González to discuss business. Goodish waited in the shower and a scuffle ensued which was followed by two groans that was loud enough for the entire locker room to hear. Tony Atlas ran over to the shower and saw that Goodish was bent over and was holding his stomach. He then looked up and noticed that González was holding the knife. Atlas had to carry Goodish down the stairs because Goodish was so big that the paramedics could not lift him up. The last words that Goodish said to Atlas were "Tell my little son I love him, and tell my wife I love her, too." Dutch Mantell received a subpoena after the trial was over and Tony Atlas refused to testify, and without his testimony the District Attorney had no case. González was charged with first-degree murder but that was later reduced and he was tried for involuntary homicide.

Aethelbald of Mercia

Aethelbald (also spelled Æthelbald) ( 757) was a Mercian nobleman who became the King of Mercia. He brought Mercia back to a position of power not seen since the days of Penda and Wulfhere. Because of his authority and his use of the title "king of the "gens Anglorum"" his people began calling themselves English instead of Saxons, Jutes or Angles. But Aethelbald was not a supporter of the Church. He claimed to be Christian but he led a scandalous and wicked lifestyle. 
Aethelbald the son of Alweo and the grandson of Penda's brother Eowa. As an and possible competitor for the throne, he was forced to leave Mercia by his cousin Ceolred. Aethelbald found refuge with his kinsman, (Saint) Guthlac of Crowland. St. Guthlac died in 714 but predicted Aethelbald would be king of Mercia. Two years later at the death of Ceolred, Aethelbald became king. One of his first acts was to begin construction of Crowland Abbey which he promised to build for Guthlac if his prediction came true. At the start of his reign Aethelbald found himself dealing with two strong kings on his borders. Ine of Wessex and Wihtred of Kent had influence in southern England. Aethelbald had influence with other southern kings. Wihtred died in 725 and Ine abdicated his throne in 726. He supported Athelheard of Wessex to become king in 726. 
Aethelbald began taking over parts of Wessex. He obtained Berkshire in 730. Three years later he took Somerton from Wessex. Aethelbald was able to give the Archbishop of Canterbury a gift of the monastery of Cookham in Berkshire (Wessex). By 731 as Bede was finishing his "Ecclesiastical History", Aethelbald was overlord of all the English kingdoms south of the River Humber. In 740 Aethelbald burned York and destroyed much of Northumbria. The same year Athelheard of Wessex died and was replaced on the throne by Cuthred. Cuthred made it known he was not as weak a ruler as Athelheard and struggled against Aethelbald being his overlord. In the first three years of Cuthred's rule he warred with Mercia but made few gains. In 743 Cuthred joined Aethelbald in fighting the Welsh. In 748 Cuthred's son, Cynric, tried to his father and died in the rebellion. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the rebellion was encouraged by Aethelbald. In 752, Cuthred tried to break free of King Aethelbald. This led to a battle at Burford where Cuthred battled against Aethelbald. The battle ended up with Aethelbald fleeing the battlefield. From that time on Cuthred maintained independence from Mercia for the rest of his reign.
He influenced the selections of three succeeding Archbishops of Canterbury (in Kent). These were Tatwine in 731, Nothhelm in 734 and Cuthbert in 740. 
Mercia was by this time a very wealthy kingdom and Aethelbald himself was very rich. He apparently used church funds for his own purposes. He forced monks to work on his building projects. Aethelbald not only forced himself on nuns but he promoted the same wicked behavior among monks. Saint Boniface complained to King Aethelbald of his evil ways in a letter dated . He pointed out Aethelbald had not taken a lawful wife nor had he observed chastity. He said the king had ruined his good name before men. Finally that the crimes Aethelbald had committed in convents with nuns and virgins doubled his offense. He warned the king to change his ways before he met a terrible death. This had no effect on Aethelbald. He grew impatient with and interfered with their privileges. Only in his later years did he develop a less high-handed way of dealing with the Church. 
In 757 Aethelbald was murdered at night by one of his own . The throne was by Beornred temporarily until Offa came to power the same year Aethelbald died. Aethelbald maintained his overlordship of all the south English kingdoms for longer than any other . He did this partially by force; Aethelbald was a great war leader. He did this partly through his great wealth through tributes paid to him by other kings. He could afford a large labor force as well as a large army. He also attempted to use the great wealth of the Church to his own advantage. But he also gave grants to the church for building monasteries. He attended great church councils that would not have taken place without his support. He was a powerful king but a less than an ideal Christian.

Jabberwocky

Jabberwocky is a 'nonsense poem' written by Lewis Carroll in his 1871 novel "Through the Looking-Glass". All the same, it does strangely make a kind of sense.
In an early scene Alice finds the verse "Jabberwocky". She says (p24)
"Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideasonly I don't exactly know what they are".
This is now thought to be one of the greatest nonsense poems written in English. Its playful, whimsical language has given us nonsense words and neologisms such as "galumphing" and "chortle".
The concept of nonsense verse was not original to Carroll. Nonsense existed in Shakespeare's work and was well known in the Brothers Grimm's fairytales, some of which are called lying tales or "lügenmärchen". 
John Tenniel reluctantly agreed to illustrate the book in 1871, and his illustrations are still the defining images of the poem.
The illustration of the Jabberwock may reflect the Victorian obsession with natural history and the fast-evolving sciences of palaeontology and geology. The works of Darwin and the models of dinosaurs at the Crystal Palace Exhibition helped feed the interest. Perhaps it is not so surprising that Tenniel gave the Jabberwock "the leathery wings of a pterodactyl and the long scaly neck and tail of a sauropod".
Jabberwocky
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!"
He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the Manxome foe he sought—
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood awhile in thought.
And as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!
One, two! One, two! and through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.
"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"
He chortled in his joy.
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
Many of the words in the poem are playful words of Carroll's own invention, without special meaning. When Alice has finished reading the poem she gives her impressions: 
'It seems very pretty,' she said when she had finished it, 'but it's rather hard to understand!' (You see she didn't like to confess, even to herself, that she couldn't make it out at all.) 'Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas—only I don't exactly know what they are! However, somebody killed something: that's clear, at any rate'
In "Through the Looking-Glass", the character of Humpty Dumpty explains to her the nonsense words from the first stanza of the poem. However, Carroll's personal commentary on several of the words differ from Humpty's. An analysis of the poem and Carroll's commentary is given in the book "The Annotated Alice" by Martin Gardner.

Ship of the line

A Ship of the line was a kind of warship. Most ships of the line were built between the 17th and 19th century. At that time, battles were fought by many such ships, which sailed in a line. At first, such ships were sailing boats, but from about the 1840s, steam-driven ships of the line were built. The steam-powered ships of the line were still made of wood. From about 1859, the Ironclad warship replaced them. 
At that time, ships had cannons. Larger ships had room for more cannons, and were therefore more likely to hit the enemy. Today, ship designs are noticeably different, as cannons are no longer used.

Battery recycling

Many batteries are thrown away in regular waste after they have been used. Battery recycling is a name of the process of separately collecting such batteries so that they can be disposed of properly. Batteries contain metals such as lead, copper or zinc. In the form that is used in the batteries, these metals are very harmful to the environment - most are toxic. Collecting the batteries allows to extract some of the metals, which can then be re-used - they are not thrown away. The part that cannot be extracted or re-used is dispoed in a for so that it is less harmful to the environment. For this reason, many countries have rules that say that a given percentage of all batteries must be re-cycled.

King's shilling

The King's shilling (or the Queen's shilling if the monarch is female) was the name given to a shilling that was given to soldiers who joined the British Army and the Royal Navy as a reward for enlisting. The word is often used when talking about the 17th and 18th centuries, but the word has been used since the English Civil War and is still used today.
Someone who said they would join the army was given the coin, but could give it back before they made a promise to a judge. Once the promise was made, they were given more money. The amount of money they were given changed over the years. In 1812, a new soldier was given £23, 17 shillings and six pence. This money was a lot, which persuaded many people to join the army, but the money was spent very quickly on uniform. Because this money was a lot, some people joined and deserted lots of times to get the money each time. One man was hanged in 1787 for doing this 47 times.

Grandfather paradox

The grandfather paradox is an unexplainable situation regarding time travel.
It is a proposed physical paradox of time travel first described by the science fiction writer Nathaniel Schachner in his short story "Ancestral Voices", and by René Barjavel in his 1943 book "Le Voyageur Imprudent" ("Future Times Three"). 
The paradox asks what happens if you were to travel back in time and killed your grandfather. Your grandfather would be dead, meaning you would never have been born, which means you could not have been alive to go back in time and kill your grandfather, but that means your grandfather would be alive and you would be born and so on with seemingly no answer. 
Since, as far as we know, time travel of this kind is not possible, the paradox is not one we will face in practice.

Berserkers (or berserks) were a special kind of Norse warrior who were widely feared. Old Norse literature said they fought in a wild, trance-like fury. This later gave us the English word "berserk". 
Many Old Norse sources say that berserkers were real. Most historians believe that berserkers worked themselves into a rage before battle. Others think they might have eaten drugged foods. The Ynglinga saga said they charged their enemy without any armour. Also that they were as mad as wolves. They could kill the enemy with a single blow of their sword while neither fire nor iron could hurt them.

Thomas Wyatt

Sir Thomas Wyatt (1503–1542) was an English poet and diplomat. He gets credit for bringing the into the English language. A sonnet is a special type of poem with 14 lines. He was "the Renaissance ideal—soldier, statesman, courtier, lover, scholar, and poet.”
Wyatt was born at Allington near Maidstone, Kent, England in 1503. His father was Henry Wyatt and his mother was named Ann Skinner. Henry Wyatt was loyal to King Henry VII of England. This allowed Henry to have many high-ranking positions in the King's court. Thomas Wyatt went to St John's College, Cambridge, from 1515 to 1522. He was twelve when he first entered the college. At age 17 in 1520, Wyatt married Elizabeth Brooke. His wife was the daughter of Lord Cobham. They had two children, Thomas and Bess. However, the marriage was unhappy. Wyatt once wrote a letter to his son that put blame in both parents for the bad marriage, "but chiefly [mostly] in her." Both Thomas Wyatt and his wife Elizabeth cheated on each other. After his wife had two children, the couple was separated.
Wyatt got his first position at court in 1516. In this year he was "sewer extraordinary," an attendant or page at the christening of Princess Mary. He was probably able to get this position so young because his father Henry had such a good reputation with the King. In 1524, Wyatt was named keeper of the King's jewels. In these early years at court, Wyatt met Anne Boleyn. Many thought they were lovers at this time, but there is no proof. In 1526, Wyatt began his career as a diplomat. Wyatt was sent to Paris, France with Sir Thomas Cheney. Cheney was one of the many people who liked Wyatt. In a letter, Cheney said Wyatt had "as much wit...as any young man hath in England."
A year later, Wyatt was sent to the Vatican in Rome and Venice, Italy with Sir John Russell. It was probably during these trips that Wyatt became interested in French and Italian poetry. While Wyatt was in Venice, he was taken prisoner by Spanish troops. They wanted England to pay 3,000 ducats to set him free. Today that is close to 300,000 USD. Wyatt escaped before the money was paid.
From 1528 to 1530, Wyatt was High Marshal of the town of Calais. During these years, Wyatt continued to have interest in French and Italian poetry. Two important poets he read were Petrarch and Ludovico Ariosto. From 1530 to 1536, King Henry VIII sent him on many shorter diplomatic missions. In 1533, Wyatt represented his father in a position called "chief sewer" at Anne Boleyn's (when she was made queen).
In May of 1534, Wyatt was imprisoned in Fleet Prison for killing one of the guard in London in a fight. This was a minor offense, so he was released quickly. But in 1536, Anne Boleyn was arrested and beheaded. She had been accused of having other lovers while married to King Henry. Around this time, Wyatt was also arrested and locked up in the Tower of London. No reason was given for Wyatt's arrest, but there were rumors that it had something to do with Anne Boleyn. It is still unclear today whether Anne Boleyn and Thomas Wyatt ever had an affair. Some of Wyatt's poems make this seem true. Nicholas Sanders, a Catholic poet, thought that Wyatt told King Henry VIII not to marry her because she was impure. He thought that Wyatt told the King about their affair to convince the King not to marry Anne. Sanders said that Wyatt was released because he had tried to warn the King that Anne would be a bad wife. Wyatt's grandson, George Wyatt, disagreed. George Wyatt said that his grandfather never had an affair with Boleyn because she rejected him. Whether or not Wyatt had a relationship with Boleyn, he was released from prison after a month. He was soon given several promotions. The promotions show that either the King forgave Wyatt or that he wasn't very mad at Wyatt in the first place. Soon, Wyatt became the Sheriff of Kent.
In 1537, Wyatt became a knight. He also began an affair with Elizabeth Darell, who had a son. Afterwards, he was sent to Spain to live in an embassy. His mission in Spain was to improve the relationship between the Holy Roman Emperor, Emperor Charles V, and King Henry VIII of England. Emperor Charles V was unhappy with the King of England because he divorced the Emperor's aunt, Catherine of Aragon. This was especially bad because the King had originally asked the Pope for special permission to marry Catherine, who was the widow of the King's older brother Arthur. The embassy was a disaster. Sir Thomas Wyatt and the other ambassadors, Edmund Bonner and Simon Heynes, were all unsuccessful. Also, Bonner disliked Wyatt. Bonner accused Wyatt of treason (and of liking papists, or Catholics). These accusations were cleared by Thomas Cromwell. Cromwell was the chief minister to Henry VIII and often protected Wyatt.
In May 1539, Wyatt returned to London. In 1540, Cromwell was arrested and beheaded. Without Cromwell's protection, Bonner got Wyatt arrested for treason. King Henry VIII, who liked Wyatt, released him with a condition: Wyatt had to leave Darell and return to his wife. Even though Wyatt was forced to separate from Darell in 1541, she and their son were still in Wyatt's will when he died.
After Wyatt again had the King's favor, he was sent on more missions to France and Flanders. In 1542, he was elected a member of Parliament from Kent. On the 3rd of October of the same year, Wyatt was sent to take an ambassador from Spain from Dorset to London. He rode for days with the ambassador but then Wyatt got sick from the journey. He fought a fever for three days and then died at Sherborne, Dorset. On October 11, 1542 he was laid to rest in the Horsely family vault in the church at Sherborne. Some poets wrote elegies (poems of mourning) for Wyatt. One of the most famous was by Wyatt's friend Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey. He wrote: "Wyatt resteth here, that quick could never rest." Surrey also thought that Wyatt "reft Chaucer the glory of his wit" (i.e. he stole Chaucer's title as the wittiest writer).
Wyatt wrote in many forms. These forms include sonnets, songs, lyric poems, and rondeaux. A rondeau is a strict poem with 13 lines and two rhymes. It also involves a repeat of the beginning of the first line. The repeat usually comes at lines 8 and 13. Sonnets are poems with 14 lines. Today we usually divide sonnets into English or Shakespearean sonnets and Italian or Petrarchan sonnets. Petrarchan sonnets are named for the Italian poet Petrarch. Petrarchan sonnets are grouped into an octave (a set of 8 lines) and a sestet (a set of 6 lines). It has the rhyme pattern abba abba cddece. Wyatt translated many of Petrarch's poems into English. Wyatt was the first to use the form we now call the Shakespearean sonnet. It is a poem of 14 lines grouped into three quatrains (a set of four lines) and a couplet (a set of two lines). It has the rhyme pattern abab cdcd efef gg. William Shakespeare came after Wyatt, but he often used the type of sonnet Wyatt invented. In fact, Shakespeare used it so often that the sonnet form was named after Shakespeare instead of Wyatt.
Wyatt's songs, sonnets, lyric poems and rondeaux were usually about love. Few of his works were published while he was alive. Those that were published during his lifetime were usually published without his name attached. 96 of Wyatt's songs were published with Surrey's work in "Songes and Sonettes, Written by the Ryght Honorable Lorde Henry Haward Late Earle of Surrey, and Other." This volume was published in 1557 by Richard Tottel. It is now more commonly called "Tottel's Miscellany." He wrote other songs that were found in other manuscripts. The main theme of his 200 songs was how he was treated badly by his mistress. Wyatt writes about both sexual and political betrayal, and sometimes mixes the two. Wyatt wrote 31 sonnets. Ten of his sonnets were translations from Petrarch.
Wyatt also wrote three satires and a series of 7 penitential psalms. Both his psalms and his satires were in "terza rima." Wyatt was the first to use "terza rima" in English. This form is where you have sets of three lines that rhyme in the following pattern: aba bcb cdc and on. He also brought "ottava rima" to English. "Ottava rima" is a set of eight lines with the rhyme pattern abababcc. For bringing so many different forms to English poetry, Wyatt was called "one of two chief lanterns of light" to future English poets by George Puttenham in 1598. The other lantern was the Earl of Surrey.
Wyatt's work was read less during the 17th Century, but was picked up again in the 18th and 19th Centuries. During this time, "Tottel’s Miscellany" was seen as a marker for the beginning of "Italianized" English poetry. But readers from the 18th and 19th Centuries did not think Wyatt's work was as good as Shakespeare's or Sidney's, who came after him. Also, 18th and 19th century readers liked Surrey's poetry better than Wyatt's poetry. This was true even after they discovered that Wyatt's poetry came first. In his History of English Poetry (1781), Thomas Warton wrote that Wyatt "is confessedly inferior to Surrey... He has too much art as a lover, and too little as a poet.’’ This view changed in the 20th century between the two World Wars. Today, many scholars think Wyatt was the better poet.

Chatham House

Chatham House, also known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs, is a London think tank. It is a non-profit, non-governmental organization. It analyses and promote the understanding of major international issues and current affairs. 
Chatham House is one of the world's leading organizations in this area. It takes its name from its premises, a Grade I listed 18th-century house in St. James's Square, once occupied by three British prime ministers, including William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham.
In a recent report, Chatham House is ranked the second most influential think tank in the world after the Brookings Institution, and the world's most influential non-US think tank. In 2009, Chatham House was also named the top non-US think tank by "Foreign Policy" magazine.
Chatham House has distinguished presidents from each of the three main political parties at Westminster: Sir John Major, former UK Prime Minister, Lord Ashdown, former EU Special Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina and former leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Baroness Scotland, the former Attorney General.
The think tank was founded in 1920 as the British Institute of International Affairs. The first chairman was Robert Cecil, a leading conservative politician. Historian Arnold Toynbee later became director. The Council on Foreign Relations, its American sister institute, was established the following year. 
Chatham House's well-known headquarters at 10 St. James's Square, London, was donated to the institute in 1923. It had been the house of three British Prime Ministers - Pitt the Elder, Edward Stanley and William Ewart Gladstone.
In 1926, now with its royal charter, the name was changed to the Royal Institute of International Affairs. However, it is usually referred to as "Chatham House".
It is just a few metres from the former Libyan embassy building where the 1984 Libyan Embassy Siege took place.
The BBC Today/Chatham House lecture series promotes debate and discussion on key international issues of the day. At the inaugural lecture in 2006, Condoleezza Rice defended the U.S. decision to go to war with Iraq.
With its members, Chatham House aims to promote debate on significant developments in international affairs and policy responses. Their independent research and analysis on global, regional and country-specific challenges is intended to offer new ideas to decision makers on how these could best be tackled from the near to the long term.
Chatham House is routinely used as a source of information for media organizations seeking background or experts upon matters involving major international issues.
It has been alleged that Chatham House reflects a pro-establishment view of the world. It does have donations from large corporations, governments and other organizations, but Chatham House is membership-based and anyone may join. Chatham House currently has international leaders from business, diplomacy, science, politics and media as its individual members.
Chatham House is the origin of the anonymity rule known as the Chatham House Rule. Guests attending a seminar may discuss the results of the seminar in the outside world, but may not discuss who attended or what any person said. The Chatham House Rule helps frank and honest discussion on controversial or unpopular issues by speakers. Despite this, most meetings at Chatham House are actually held on the record, and not under the Chatham House Rule.

The Wurzels

The Wurzels (originally Adge Cutler and the Wurzels but renamed after Cutler's death) are a British Scrumpy and Western band. 
The Somerset-based band is best known for their 1976 number one hit "Combine Harvester", and number three hit "I Am A Cider Drinker" based on the song "Una Paloma Blanca". They have lasted over 40 years, and still perform to this day.
The name of the band was dreamt up by the band's founder Adge Cutler. It appears to be short for mangelwurzel, a type of beetroot grown to feed livestock.
The Wurzels' particular genre of music was called Scrumpy and Western after the group's first EP of the same name, issued early in 1967. Scrumpy is slang for the potent cider made in southwest England, popular amongst The Wurzels and their fans, and often referred to in their songs.
The Wurzels were formed in 1966 as a backing group for singer/songwriter Adge Cutler. With a thick Somerset accent, Adge played on his West Country roots, singing many folk songs with local themes such as cider making (and drinking), farming, dung-spreading, local villages and industrial work songs, often with a comic slant.
During the latter half of the 1960s, the band became immensely popular regionally, and the release of the single "Drink Up Thy Zider" in 1966 led to national fame and it reaching number 45 in the UK chart. The B-side "Twice Daily" was banned by the BBC for being too raunchy. A number of live albums were recorded at local pubs and clubs.
Adge Cutler died after falling asleep at the wheel of his MG sports car which overturned on a roundabout approaching the Severn Bridge. He was returning alone from a Wurzels show in Hereford in May 1974. He is buried in Nailsea.
Adge's death marked a turning point in the history of the Wurzels. Deprived of the main song-writing talent, the remaining Wurzels recorded "The Wurzels Are Scrumptious!" in 1975, an album containing many favourites from the back catalogue, including a number of previously unrecorded Cutler-written songs. In order to continue the surviving band needed its own songs, and these mostly took the formula of re-written popular pop songs of the time with the lyrics changed to include the usual Wurzel themes (cider, farming, local villages, Cheddar cheese, etc.)
In 1976, the Wurzels released "The Combine Harvester", a re-work of the song "Brand New Key", by Melanie, which became a UK hit, topping the charts for 2 weeks. The band quickly followed its success with "I Am A Cider Drinker" (a rework of the "Una Paloma Blanca" melody), which got to number three in the charts, and "Farmer Bill's Cowman" (a reworking of the Whistling Jack Smith instrumental "I Was Kaiser Bill's Batman").
The Wurzels have never stopped performing. The group signed to Cumbria record label Loose Records & Music, and recorded four new new songs including the single "I Wanna Be An Eddie Stobart Driver" (released as a limited edition lorry-shaped disc).
The late 1990s saw the fortunes of the surviving Wurzels revive, gaining cult status among students and a resurgence in their native West Country. Under the new management of The Stranglers manager Sil Willcox a number of CD releases followed, largely featuring re-recordings of older works. "Never Mind The Bullocks, Ere's The Wurzels" had covers of British rock songs. The album title and cover were a spoof on "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols".
Their latest album is "A Load More Bullocks" (2010) for the CIA label.

The Adour river has a length of , and a drainage basin with an area of approximately .
The Adour river is born, as Adour de Payolle, at the north side of the Arbizon mountain. In the Campan valley, that is formed by three smaller valleys corresponding to the sources of the three "Adours" ("Adour de Payolle", "Adour de Gripp" and the "Adour de Lesponne"), these small rivers meet at Campan (Arrondissement of Bagnères-de-Bigorre) to form the Adour river.
The Adour flows north for almost a hundred miles through the Hautes-Pyrénées to Gers. There, it turned to the west and gets into the Landes department. In Port-de-Lanne, the Adour is joined by the Gaves réunis river and, finally, it flows into the Bay of Biscay, in the Atlantic Ocean, between Anglet (Pyrénées-Atlantiques) and Tarnos (Landes).
The river is (it is deep, wide and slow enough for a ship to pass) for about from its mouth.

Hiroshi Tanahashi (born November 13, 1976) is a Japanese professional wrestler who is currently working for New Japan Pro Wrestling.
During his time in NJPW, he has become a six-time IWGP Heavyweight Champion. He shares the record for most reigns as IWGP Heavyweight Champion with Tatsumi Fujinami and also holds the record for most successful defenses with eleven during his fifth reign as champion.
Before becoming a professional wrestler, Tanahashi played baseball in high school and also started wrestling during his time attending Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto. While he was wrestling, he was noticed by New Japan Pro Wrestling talent scouts and was invited to try out for the New Japan Dojo. His tryout was successful and he was brought in as a trainee.
Tanahashi made his debut in October 1999 in a match against Shinya Makabe. During that time, he was viewed as a big prospect and he earned wins over lucha libre legend Negro Casas in July 2000 and American Scott Hall in September 2001.
He would go on to team with Kenzo Suzuki with their tag team being called the Kings of the Hills. The team ended when a real life incident occurred in November 2002 with Tanahashi being stabbed in the back by Hitomi Hara (a TV Asahi news reporter that he had dated for a brief amount of time). He was hospitalized, but recovered.
He returned to in-ring competition this time as a singles wrestler on February 16, 2003 in a match against Manabu Nakanishi in front of a sold-out Tokyo crowd.
On January 4, 2014, Tanahashi was able to defeat Shinsuke Nakamura in the main event of Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome to win the IWGP Intercontinental Championship. He had a rematch against Nakamura at The New Beginning in Hiroshima on February 9 where he was successful in defending his championship. When Nakamura won the 2014 New Japan Cup, Tanahashi had a second rematch against Nakamura at Invasion Attack 2014 on April 6. Nakamura defeated Tanahashi for the championship in the match.

<doc id="424364" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=424364" title="Listening">
Listening

Listening is not quite the same thing as hearing. Hearing is a biological process that can be scientifically explained, but listening is a psychological process of what happens to sounds as we interpret and use them. It is a cognitive activity.
In psychology, speech is part of pragmatics, a field which deals with signs and their interpretation. The signs in question are called "speech acts".
To listen means to try and understand what has been said. Listening is often one side of a conversation. Asking questions helps one understand what has been said. A subject can be better understood by asking the correct questions.
Listening differs from obeying. Parents often say to a disobedient child that he "didn't listen to me", meaning, he heard but didn't do as was suggested.
Listening also applies to sounds, not just language. It is "active" hearing. We hear a sound, and know what it means. This applies to animals as well. Cats list in the long grass for the little sounds that mice make. So perhaps a better description of listening is "deliberate hearing to get the meaning of sounds".

On May 24, 2012, Eminem said that he had begun working on his next album in an interview on Hot 97's morning show with Peter Rosenberg.
On February 8, 2013, Shady Records president and Eminem manager Paul Rosenberg told "Billboard": "We fully expect to be releasing a new Eminem album in 2013. He's been working on it for some time.

Ecgfrith of Mercia

Ecgfrith ( 796) was the King of Mercia from July to December 796. He was the son of Offa, the King of Mercia, and Cynethryth. In 787 he was crowned King of Mercia while his father still ruled. This is the first known consecration of an English king. No doubt it was Offs's imitation of the consecration of Charlemagne's sons by the pope in 781. It was a practical way to recognize Ecgfrith as heir to the Mercian kingdom. Offa continued to rule and maintained all the power himself. 
Ecgfrith was succeeded as king by Coenwulf. This was probably because Offa had arranged the murder of nearer relatives in order to eliminate any rivals to Ecgfrith. Alcuin of York, an English deacon and scholar wrote: 
When his father died in July of 796 Ecgfrith was king for only 141 days. The cause of his death is unknown but may not have been natural.

Division of Lindsay

The Division of Lindsay is an Australian Electoral Division in the state of New South Wales. It was set up in 1984 and is named after Sir Norman Lindsay, the Australian artist, writer and sculptor. 
The division is in the outer western suburbs of Sydney, and includes Cambridge Park, Cambridge Gardens, Castlereagh, Claremont Meadows, Cranebrook, Emu Plains, Glenmore Park, Jamisontown, Kingswood, Leonay, Llandilo, North St Marys, Oxley Park, Penrith, Regentville, St Marys, South Penrith, Werrington, Werrington County, Werrington Downs and parts of Agnes Banks, Luddenham and Wallacia.
Since it was set up in 1984, its winning member of parliament has been from the party winning government. 
Jackie Kelly won the seat during the 1996 election. Her win was challenged in the Court of Disputed Returns because she was still a citizen of New Zealand, and she worked as a legal officer for the Royal Australian Air Force. The Australian Constitution (Section 44) does not allow people who are citizens of another country, or people who are employed by the government to be members of Parliament. A by-election was held, and Kelly who had given up her New Zealand citizenship, and resigned from her airforce job was elected again.
In 2007 Kelly was again in trouble. Three days before the election her supporters, including her husband, were caught in Lindsay putting fake letters in peoples' letterboxes. These letters linked the Labor Party to Islamic terrorism. 
David Bradbury had served as the Mayor of Penrith. Every member of Lindsay to date, except Scott, has served as a minister.

Stop codon

A stop codon is special sequence in the genetic code. It is a nucleotide triplet in messenger RNA that signals the end of translation.
It is a codon (that is, a sequence of three nucleotides in messenger RNA). It indicates the end of a gene. Similar to how a full stop indicates the end of a sentence, a stop codon signals the end of genetic translation.
They are also called termination codons or chain termination codons. There are three such codons: UAA, UAG and UGA.
Proteins are based on polypeptides, which are unique sequences of amino acids. Most codons in messenger RNA correspond to the addition of an amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain, which may ultimately become a protein. Stop codons indicate the end of this process, and therefore, the end of polypeptide synthesis.

Coenwulf of Mercia

Coenwulf (also spelled Cenwulf and Kenulf) (died 821) was a Mercian nobleman and the King of Mercia from December 796 until his death. He claimed to be a descendant of a Cenwalh, a brother of Penda and Eowa. The sudden death of King Ecgfrith of Mercia was suspicious and certainly benefited Coenwulf but he was never formally accused. Coenwulf proved to be a strong king who quickly restored Mercian in southern England. He was the last of the Mercian overlords or .
Coenwulf was the son of Cuthbert, a Mercian nobleman. He came to the throne in 796, the same year Offa and his son Ecgfrith both died. At the same time Coenwulf became king, Eadberht Praen set himself up as king of Kent. An Eadwald set himself up as king of the East Angles and began issuing coins. When Eadberht Praen expelled Aethelheard, the Archbishop of Canterbury from Kent, Coenwulf contacted Pope Leo III and got permission to remove the new Kentish king. Eadbert attacked Kent, and captured Eadbert. He then set up his brother Cuthred as king of Kent. Coenwulf then dealt with East Anglia where Eadwald had tried to gain independence from Mercia. In 799 Coenwulf made a peace treaty with Wessex. He restored Mercian power to southern England very quickly. He then began using the style of Charlemagne calling himself king and emperor. He attacked the Welsh making raids on Gwynedd and Powys. In one of these battles Caradog ap Meirion, the king of Gwynedd was killed. In 801 King Eardwulf of Northumbria attacked Mercia. He accused Coenwulf of giving refuge to his enemies. Eventually the two made peace on equal terms. This was through the mediations of several bishops and nobles.
Coenwulf wanted all the English churches placed under the authority of a single archbishop. But he wanted him seated in London, not Canterbury. He managed to abolish the of Lichfield in 803. Coenwulf tried to convince the pope on moving the remaining archbishopric to London. But the pope felt that Coenwulf's success in bringing Kent under his control meant the move was no longer necessary. So the archbishop remained in Canterbury, Kent. When Archbishop Aethelheard died in 805, his Wulfred was appointed the new archbishop. Wulfred witnessed charters for Coenwulf from 805 to 817 but then promptly stopped. Archbishop Wulfred and King Coenwulf quarreled for several years. It may have started over a claim by Coenwulf to various lands held by the see of Canterbury. Wulfred in turn began minting coins without the name of King Coenwulf. Finally in 817 Coenwulf took Wulfred's monasteries of Reculver and Minster-in-Thanet. Then he brought charges against Wulfred to Pope Paschal I. As a result, Wulfred was relieved of many of his duties by the pope. In 821 Coenwulf summoned the archbishop to appear before him in London. There Wulfred was fined 120 pounds and an estate of 250 hides He was then restored to his duties as archbishop. In 818 he was again attacking the Britons in Dyfed. He was planning another campaign against Wales when he died in 821. He was succeeded by his brother Ceolwulf I of Mercia. Coenwulf was buried at Winchcombe abbey where his daughter Cwenthryh was later . A lead seal belonging to King Coenwulf was found during the 19th century in Italy. It is now in the British Museum.
Coenwulf had two known children:

Ceolwulf I of Mercia

Ceolwulf I was the King of Mercia, East Anglia and Kent from 821 to 823. He succeeded his brother Coenwulf of Mercia. There was a great deal of disagreement among his noblemen during his short reign. He was deposed and exiled from Mercia by Beornwulf of Mercia who claimed the throne himself.
He was the son Cuthbert, a Mercian nobleman. His brother Coenwulf ruled Mercia before him. At his brother's death the Mercians were attacking Wales. Ceolwulf continued where Coenwulf left off. The "Annales Cambriae" for the year 822 said the 'Saxons' attacked and destroyed the fortress at Deganwy and then controlled Powys. Welsh poems of the time confirm Mercia was attacking Powys. On 17 September 822 he was consecrated king by Archbishop Wulfred. In issued by Ceolwulf he styled himself This shows he had authority in Kent. But his rule in Mercia was marked by among his noblemen. He was removed from the throne in 823. After being deposed Ceolwulf left Mercia for Rome. By this time he was older, probably in his fifties. He was the last of the Iclingas dynasty who had ruled Mercia for over three centuries. Beornwulf who replaced him was from a family little is known about.

<doc id="424795" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=424795" title="Machine pistol">
Machine pistol

A machine pistol is a typically a -style firearm that can fire fully automatic or burst fire. Fully automatic means that the gun will continue to fire very rapidly so long as the trigger is pressed and held. Burst fire means that when you pull the trigger, a number of shots determined by the shooter will be fired (for some guns, this is three shots, fired very quickly). Machine pistols fire pistol cartridges. Machine pistols usually have the cartridges fed into the gun with a magazine, which is a rectangular box which holds the cartridges.
Machine pistols are usually self-loading, which means that the gun automatically loads a new cartridge into the chamber after a shot is fired. 
The first true machine pistol was the German MP-18 introduced in 1918. It fired the 9mm Parabellum cartridge. It used a side-loading magazine that held 20 cartridges. 
The Germans converted some guns, like the Luger, into machine pistols. They invented a type of Luger called the Luger P08 in World War I to German artillery crews. It had a longer barrel and a 32 round magazine shaped like a round drum. It was given to artillery crews so they could defend themselves.
In 1951 the Russian army developed the Stechkin APS, which could fire in burst fire or in fully automatic fire. When the gun was used in burst or automatic fire, users were told to use the wooden stock so that they can control the weapon better. One of the problems with machine pistols is they tend to rise up when being fired, making the bullets miss their target.
In the 1990s and 2000s, as more soldier began wearing bulletproof vests with hard ceramic armor, the machine pistol became less useful in a military setting. The low-powered pistol ammunition was not able to penetrate ceramic-plated Kevlar military vests. As a result, armies began to issue a new gun, the personal defense weapon or PDW. The PDW fires armor-piercing, higher-powered ammunition which can go through bulletproof vests.

Little is known about Beornwulf's family. He played a large part in Ceolwulf I losing the throne in 823. He succeeded Ceolwulf as king in the summer of 823. Beornwulf continued the campaign against Powys started by Coenwulf and his brother Ceolwulf I. By the end of 823 Powys was being controlled by Mercia. By 825 Beornwulf had extended his authority over Kent, Essex and Middlesex. In 825 Beornwulf invaded Wessex. In what Frank Stenton called "one of the most decisive battles of Anglo-Saxon history" Egbert defeated Beornwulf at the Battle of Ellandun. This was the end of the Mercian kings dominating England. Egbert sent his son Athelwulf with an army to overthrow Baldred, the Mercian sub-king. As a result, all of Kent, Surrey, Sussex and East Anglia submitted to Egbert of Wessex. Egbert was cautious though. He kew Mercia had a powerful army and did not attack Mercia directly. Instead he the East Anglians to revolt against Beornwulf.

The French Resistance is the name used to refer to the different French resistance movements that fought against the Nazi German occupation in France during World War II (1939–1945). Résistance cells were small groups of armed men and women who killed German soldiers, published secret underground newspapers, collected information about the German army, and helped Allied soldiers and pilots who were trapped in France to get back to Great Britain. The men and women of the Résistance came from all levels of society and many different religions.
The Allied armies helped the French Resistance by providing them with guns and explosives. It was very dangerous to be a member of the French resistance. Members who were caught by the Germans were often tortured and killed. When the Resistance killed a German officer, sometimes the Nazi army would kill large numbers of innocent civilians as a punishment.
The French Resistance helped the Allied armies to advance through France following the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944, and the invasion of Provence on 15 August by providing information about the German defenses. The resistance also sabotaged the electrical power grid, transportation methods, and telecommunications networks. During the Nazi occupation of France, the resistance was an inspiring example of patriotic behavior and bravery.
When the war was over, the Resistance executed about 9,000 people who were collaborating with the Nazi occupiers. This included many members of the Milices, a fascist organization that helped Nazi Germany.

Lap dance

A lap dance is a type of sex work performed in some strip clubs (clubs in which women or men take off their clothes as they dance to music). In this, a dancer performs an erotic dance either contacting their body (contact dancing) with a seated patron or within a very short distance of a seated patron.
The dancer may be naked, topless or wearing a bikini top and bottom, depending on the laws in the jurisdiction of the strip club and the club's policies. With full-contact lap dances, the stripper may engage in contact with the patron, such as pressing his or her body against the patron. Different types include a "couch dance", which is a lap dance where the customer is seated on a couch, and bed dance where the customer lies down on a bed. 
In some clubs, a "block session" of lap dances (usually half an hour to an hour) can be booked in a "champagne room", which is a private room in the back of a club. In many clubs, the duration of a lap dance is measured by the length of the song being played by the club's DJ. Charges for lap dances vary.
Depending on the local jurisdiction and community standards, lap dances can involve touching of the dancer by the patron, touching the patron by the dancer, neither, or both. In some clubs, any touching by the patron is forbidden. On the other hand, if a club does not enforce its rules, levels of contact may be negotiable between the participants. Clubs vary widely with regard to whether they enforce their rules or ignore any violations.
Critics of lapdancing say that some club owners, by installing dark private booths and charging dancers high stage fees to work at the club, are encouraging the sale of sexual acts between customers and dancers. According to the UK paper The Guardian, "Research shows that the majority of women become lap-dancers through poverty and lack" of other jobs.

In 824 two of King Beornwulf are witnessed by Ludeca, then a member of his court. His title on those charters is . Nothing else is known of Ludeca. At Beornwulf's death he became king. But the kingdom Ludeca now ruled was just Mercia, Lindsey, Middle Anglia and the Mercian provinces of the Hwicce and Magonsæte. All of southern England was in disorder. Egbert of Wessex now had control of Essex and Kent. He had the revolt by the East Anglians that resulted in Beornwulf's death. The East Anglians saw this as a chance for their independence from Mercia. A few months later Ludeca led his army against them but he was killed. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 825 (actual year 827) recorded: "In this year Ludecan, king of the Mercians, was slain, and his five aldormen [ealdormen] with him, and Wiglaf succeeded to the kingdom."

A strip club is a type of club that has performers who dance while removing their clothes. Most strip clubs are also bars which serve alcohol. Many communities have rules on strip clubs, such as rules on how many strip clubs are allowed to exist in the community, rules on the minimum distance that must be kept between dancers and customers (e.g., the "six-foot" minimum distance in San Diego), or rules on what clothing cannot be taken off (e.g. panties).
Some strip clubs offer lap dancing, which is a type of sex work that typically involves a female dancer pressing her body against a male customer for a fee.
Strip clubs can be a source of debates in a community. Iceland banned strip clubs for feminist reasons while in Britain there is still discussion about whether they are positive for woman.

Regions of the Philippines

In the Philippines, regions (Tagalog: "rehiyon") are administrative divisions that serve primarily to organize the provinces ("lalawigan") of the country for administrative convenience. Most government offices are established by region instead of individual provincial offices, usually (but not always) in the city that is the regional center.
The regions themselves do not possess a separate local government, with the exception of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, which has an elected regional assembly and governor.
The Philippines has 17 administrative regions. Fourteen of these regions are designated with numbers corresponding to their geographic location in order from north to south. The National Capital Region, Cordillera Administrative Region, and Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao do not have numerical designations.
These regions are geographically combined into the three island groups of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Following is a list of the regions in their island groupings.
The regions CALABARZON, MIMAROPA, and SOCCSKSARGEN are written with upper case characters because they are acronyms that stand for their component provinces or cities. CALABARZON stands for CAvite, LAguna, BAtangas, Rizal and QueZON; MIMAROPA stands for Occidental and Oriental MIndoro, MArinduque, ROmblon and PAlawan; and SOCCSKSARGEN stands for SOuth Cotabato, Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, SARangani and GENeral Santos.

Poseur

Poseur (or poser) is a negative term used by some subcultures. It describes a person who copies the style or mannerisms of a subculture, but who is not considered to belong to it. It implies that the person is fake, and is considered not to share or understand the values or philosophy of that culture.
A person may copy the style of a particular subculture to be accepted within that group or for popularity among various other groups.
The term is often used in the punk, heavy metal, hip hop, and goth subcultures, or the skateboarding and surfing communities. For example, in the hardcore punk scene, older punks may view a young punk with an "anarchy" symbol on their shirt as a poseur if the older punks think the young punk does not understand what the symbol means.

Battle of Ellandun

The Battle of Ellandun (also spelled Ellendun) was fought in 825 between the armies of Egbert of Wessex and Beornwulf of Mercia. Although costly to both sides, King Egbert won. The battle effectively brought an end to Mercian in southern England. It gave Wessex over the remaining Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the south. A century later the kingdom of Wessex became the kingdom of England.
During the 8th century and early 9th centuries, the kings of Mercia exercised varying degrees of overlordship over the kingdoms of south-eastern England. Some even ruled other kingdoms directly. While Wessex had at times been obliged to recognise the power of Mercian kings there was usually a strong resistance to allowing them to directly rule Wessex.
Beorhtric of Wessex (786–802) had probably received help from Offa of Mercia (757–796) in becoming king of Wessex. In 789 he married Eadburh, Offa's daughter. For the remainder of his rule Wessex was subordinate to Mercia. At the time Beorhtric became king, Egbert was also a claimant. Edgar was exiled for a time from Wessex and spent most of his time at the court of Charlemagne. On the death of Beorhtric Egbert returned and succeeded to the throne. At this time Coenwulf of Mercia (796–821) was king and he concluded a peace treaty with Wessex.
In 815 Egbert invaded Cornwall and brought it under his rule. He allowed sub-kings to rule it for him. 
Beginning in 825 Egbert began a series of military operations with the intent of increasing his over Wales. At the same time the new king of Mercia, Beornwulf, having had extended his authority over Kent, Essex and Middlesex decided to invade Wessex.
Egbert was in Cornwall with his army when he received word that the Mercians had invaded Wessex. He led his army back into Wessex and met Beornwulf and his army at Ellendun (now Wroughton south of Swindon). In what Frank Stenton called "one of the most decisive battles of Anglo-Saxon history", Egbert defeated Beornwulf. The battle was costly to both sides in loss of life. Henry of Huntingdon said the river ran red with blood. The victory over Mercia shifted the balance of power to Egbert. He was now the most accomplished king in southern England.
Immediately Egbert sent his son Athelwulf with an army to overthrow Baldred, the Mercian sub-king in Kent. As a result, all of Kent, Surrey, Sussex and East Anglia submitted to Egbert. Beornwulf tried to recover East Anglia later the same year and was killed in the attempt. Kent, Surrey and Sussex remained a part of the kingdom of Wessex from this time on. Egbert appointed his son Athelwulf as sub-king of Kent which included all the new territories of Wessex.
In 829 Egbert invaded, then defeated all of Mercia. Wiglaf was exiled. The king of Northumbria submitted to him after the defeat of Mercia. He assumed the title (King of Mercia). This title was also on coins made in the former Mercian port of London. In 830 Wiglaf returned to power in Mercia, but the gains of Kent and southwest England remained with Wessex. Egbert died 4 February 839. He left a territory larger than any other Wessex king since Ine.

Pawn shop

A pawn shop (also called a pawnshop or pawnbroker) is a shop or business who loans money to people who bring in valuable items which they leave with the pawnbroker. Examples of items that a person may leave are jewellery, gold, watches, cameras, musical instruments, televisions or computers.
The valuables that people leave are called the "collateral". The person can get their valuable item back from the pawnbroker if the pay back the money they were loaned and pay interest on the loan. Interest is like a fee for getting to use someone else's money for a set time period. If the person who has borrowed money from the pawnbroker does not repay the loan and interest within an agreed-upon time limit, the pawnbroker can sell the valuable item to another customer to get back the money they loaned.
To prevent thieves from using pawnshops as a way to get money from stolen goods, many communities have laws requiring that people who bring in valuable items to the pawnshop have to show identification, such as a driver's licence.

Tipping

A tip (also called a gratuity) is an amount of money given as gratitude to somebody who has provided a service. It is normally in addition to any fee that is charged. It is a custom in many societies. For example, after people finish eating dinner at a restaurant, even after they have paid the bill for the food, they leave some extra money on the table to thank the server.
Tipping and the amount of money that people give as tips varies between countries. In some locations tipping is discouraged and considered insulting. In other locations tipping is expected from customers. The tip can be a specific range of money or a percentage of the bill, such as 15 percent or 20 percent. In some circumstances, such as with government workers in some areas, giving tips is against the law. Some restaurants charge a service charge and add it onto the bill. In this case, you do not have to leave a tip. For many service workers, like servers, bartenders, and taxi drivers, tips are an important part of their income.

Bass instrument amplification is an amplifier used for bass guitars, double bass and similar instruments. It makes the sound they make louder. It is different from other types of amplification systems because it is difficult to reproduce low-frequency sounds (bass). Bass amps need strong loudspeakers, and a relatively larger speaker cabinet. Speaker cabinets for bass instrument amplification usually have larger (or more) loudspeakers than those used for the amplification of other instruments. The loudspeakers themselves must also be sturdier to handle the higher power levels.

Hertford was originally known as "Hart Hall". The land for Hart Hall was bought by Elias de Hertford in 1282. Hart Hall was a residence for students at other colleges in Oxford. In 1312, Hart Hall was purchased by Walter de Stapledon, who was the Bishop of Exeter. De Stapledon founded Exeter College and Hart Hall was controlled by Exeter College for many years.
In 1710, William Newton became the Principal of Hart Hall. In 1723, Newton formally proposed that Hart Hall be chartered as its own college. In 1739 a charter was granted for the new Hertford College. After Newton died, however, the college declined, and it was dissolved in 1816.
The grounds of the college was taken over by Magdalene Hall. Magdalene Hall began as a grammar school associated with Magdalene College in 1448. Magdalene Hall moved to the site of the former Hertford College in 1822. It grew at the new site, and in 1874, Magdalene Hall was given a charter as Hertford College. The new name was chosen so that it would not be confused with Magdalene College, and because it was on the location of the former Hertford College.

German invasion of Norway

The German invasion of Norway occurred during the Second World War. It led to battles between the Allies and Germany. In April 1940, the United Kingdom and France came to help Norway by sending soldiers and warships. The Allies had to withdraw and the Norwegian government had to escape from Norway and seek exile in London. Even though the Germans occupied Norway, some Norwegians formed the Norwegian resistance and kept fighting the Germans. Norway held off the Germans for 62 days, making Norway the nation that withstood a German invasion for the longest period of time, after the Soviet Union.

Sexless marriage

A sexless marriage is a marriage in which the partners do not have sex very often or at all. The U.S. National Health and Social Life Survey in 1994 (Laumann et al. 1994) found that 2 percent of the married people who answered said they did not have sex in the past year. The definition of a sexless marriage is often broadened, to include marriages where sex occurs less than ten times per year. Using this definition, 20 percent of the couples in the National Health and Social Life Survey would be in the category. "Newsweek" magazine says that 15 to 20 percent of couples in the U.S. are in a sexless relationship.

Insignificance

Insignificance is a feeling that nothing you do matters, or that you are not important. People may feel this for many reasons. For example, having low self-esteem, being depressed, living in a large city with many people, comparing themselves to rich celebrity success stories, working in a large bureaucracy, or being in awe of a natural wonder.
People living in crowded, major cities may face feelings of insignificance. George Simmel says that when people live in a big city, they may start to feel like "...just another face in the crowd", it can "lead to feelings of insignificance...".

Emptiness

Emptiness is a sense of general boredom, feeling socially separated from other people, and feeling that you do not care any more. Feelings of emptiness often accompany depression, loneliness, or despair. A sense of emptiness is also part of a natural process of grief, caused by separation from or the death of somebody you love.
While Christianity and Western sociologists and psychologists consider a state of emptiness as a negative, bad condition, in some Eastern philosophies such as Buddhist philosophy and Taoism, emptiness is seen as a real achievement.

M4 carbine

The M4 carbine is a type of carbine used in the military. A carbine is a shorter, lighter type of rifle. It was based on the M16 rifle.
The M4 is a gas-operated, shoulder-fired weapon. The cartridges are fed into the gun with a magazine, which is a rectangular box that holds the cartridges. It has a stock that can be extended or pushed in and a 14.5 in (370 mm) barrel to make it easier for soldiers to use the weapon in confined spaces. Like the other rifles in the M16 family, it fires the .223 caliber, or 5.56mm NATO round.
The M4 can be fired in two ways, either semi-automatic (which fires one bullet when the trigger is pulled) and three-round burst (which fires three bullets very quickly when the trigger is pulled). The M4A1 can fire fully automatic instead of three-round burst. The carbine can have an M203 grenade as well as the newer M320 grenade launcher mounted on it. The M4 can be fitted with many accessories, such as night vision devices, silencers, laser pointers, telescopic sights, bipods, a shotgun, and forward hand grips.
The United States Marine Corps has ordered its officers (up to the rank of lieutenant colonel) and staff non-commissioned officers to carry the M4 carbine instead of the M9 pistol. The M4 is also widely used by police officers.
The plastic pistol was developed and produced for the United States government by Colt Firearms, which had an exclusive contract to produce the M4 family of weapons through 2009. Colt previously held a U.S. trademark on the term "M4".
Other manufacturers offer M4-like firearms. Many manufacturers have production firearms that are essentially identical to a military M4, but with a 16" barrel. Civilian models are sometimes colloquially referred to as "M4gery", a portmanteau word from "M4" and "forgery". 
Colt said it held sole rights to the M4 name and design. Other manufacturers said that Colt was overstating its rights, and that "M4" was now a generic term for a shortened AR-15. On December 8, 2005, a District court judge ruled that "M4" "was" now a generic name, and that Colt's trademark should be revoked.

He released his first six recordings with the label. He still records for CrossCut Records in Europe, and has previously worked with Ruf Records in United States. In the last decade, he has released seven albums and played in 19 countries, four continents. He continues to tour extensively. Jones lives who lives in Ottawa, Ontario. He has performed at blues festivals, theatres and clubs in Canada, the United States, Europe, Russia, Australia, and Brazil.
Jones' third album with his band, "My Kind Of Evil" (2004), was produced by Kim Wilson (singer for The Fabulous Thunderbirds). It includes vocals from Colin James on two tracks, and Roxanne Potvin on one. Songs from the album have been played on House of Blues Radio Hour. Music reviewer Brad Wheeler from Canada's "Globe and Mail" newspaper praised the "graceful ability he (Jones) shows on guitar" in the album. Wheeler stated that "...the Ottawa player makes retro moves, layering swinging blues with keyboards and very noticeable horns that never dominate the fine-lined fills and lead work." The Allmusic review of "My Kind of Evil", by Chris Nickson, states that "He's very good on covers, such as "I Don't Know", but his own songs — the vast majority of this disc — have plenty of life."
In May 2009, Jones' song "Parasomnia" appeared on a "Guitar World" featured CD, "Guitar Masters Vol. 2". Other artists on the CD were B. B. King, Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, and Carlos Santana. The "Globe and Mail" referred to Jones as "one of this country's top blues guitar stars". The "Blues Revue Magazine" stated that Jones' guitar playing is like T-Bone Walker's guitar playing. The review said that JW-Jones plays solo melodies like Johnny "Guitar" Watson, and that his guitar playing is like Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown. "Billboard" called Jones part of "a new wave of young talent moving onto Canada’s blues stage."

Midterm exam

A midterm exam is a test given around the middle of a term in schools.
Midterm exams can be given for several reasons. First, it allows a student to see if they need to change how they study for the class (if they do not do well on the exam) or if they should continue to study the same way for the rest of the term (if they do well). This tells a student who does not do well that they should drop the class. Many colleges stop allowing students to drop a class a week or two after the first midterm exam. Midterm exams can also show how well a teacher is doing in teaching their class. Some teachers give more than one midterm exam.

Hide (unit)

The hide was a unit of land measurement. Everywhere in Anglo-Saxon England except Kent it was the land held by a peasant and his family. Originally it was the amount of land necessary to support one household. The amount of land that made up one hide would vary from one part of Britain to another. This was because the quality of soil for growing food would be different. In places where the soil was very rich, a hide of land would be smaller. Where the soil was poor the hide would be larger. It was never a standard using fixed measurements. Later in Anglo-Saxon England a hide became a unit on which to base payment of or tax. The hide was also used to determine public obligations. This could be defending the local castle or providing soldiers for the local . Tenants paid rent based on how many hides they farmed.

Niggers in the White House

"Niggers in the White House" was a racist poem that first appeared in many American newspapers between 1901 and 1903. The author wrote it because he did not like Booker T. Washington, an African-American political leader, teacher and author, attending a dinner at the White House. Washington had been invited by President Theodore Roosevelt, who was Caucasian. Many years later, in 1929, the poem appeared again. This was after African-American congressman Oscar DePriest's wife went to a tea for congressional wives at the White House. She had been invited by First Lady Lou Hoover. Many people, especially in the Southern United States, did not like either visit. Many held the opinion then that African-American people should not be involved in government affairs.
The poem has fourteen stanzas. Each stanza has four lines. The second and fourth line of each stanza rhymes. The bad word "nigger" is seen many times in the poem. Nobody knows who wrote it.
Booker T. Washington was an African American born into slavery. He was freed in 1865 and rose to become an educator and a national leader of African Americans. On October 16, 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt asked Washington to have dinner with his family at the White House. It was a working dinner, Roosevelt's intention was to appoint Washington to advise him on issues of race. A family friend from Colorado, Philip Stewart was also there. A reporter from the AP Wire asked the president about his appointments he was going to announce the next day. But the story that appeared in the AP wire read: "Booker T. Washington, of Tuskegee, Alabala, dined with the President last evening." This caused some shock among many people. The President of the United States had sat down to dinner with a black man, a former slave at that. African Americans had visited the White House before but had never been asked to dine there. Washington had dined with President McKinley previously which also caused an uproar at that time. This time segregationalists in the U.S. Congress were outraged. Senator "Pitchfork" Bill Tillman of South Carolina said, "The action will necessitate our killing a thousand niggers in the South before they will learn their place again."
After this, somebody decided to write the poem, "Niggers in the White House". No one knows who the author was.
Many years later, in 1929, First Lady Lou Hoover, wife of president Herbert Hoover, invited Congressional wife Jessie DePriest to join her for tea. She was a black woman married to Oscar DePriest, the first African American to be elected to Congress from Illinois. People were also upset about this. The poem appeared again because of this incident. Southern newspapers and racist critics reacted with their normal outrage and letters of protest. The White House spokesman pointed out the president and his wife were simply doing their constitutional duties. As examples President Grover Cleveland had hosted Frederick Douglass and his wife On five separate occasions president Woodrow Wilson met at the White House with the black minister from Haiti, Solon Menos. 
Politicians took sides. Senator Coleman Blease from South Carolina inserted the poem in a Senate resolution. The resolution with its poem were rejected and removed from the "Congressional Record." The vote was based on protests from senators Walter Edge (from New Jersey) and Hiram Bingham (from Connecticut). Senator Bingham described the poem as "indecent, obscene doggerel verse" which gave "offense to hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens and an offense to the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution." Senator Baise then agreed to withdraw the resolution he said, as a favor to Senator Bingham and not to the negro race.

A carbine is a lighter, shorter type of rifle. The smaller size and lighter weight of carbines makes them easier to handle.

Body armour

Modern body armour (personal armour/armor or body armor) is protective clothing. It is designed to absorb and/or deflect slashing, bludgeoning, and penetrating attacks. 
It was first used to protect soldiers, today it is used to protect riot police, private security guards and bodyguards. There are two different types of armour. There is regular non-plated personal armor used by most police, security guards and bodyguards. There is also hard-plate reinforced personal armor, which is used by combat soldiers, police tactical units and hostage rescue teams.
Armour is certainly very ancient, but it was little used in infantry warfare for quite a long time, with the exception of helmets. From about the 18th century to the Vietnam war, men fought relatively unprotected. The weight and cost of effective armour meant it was no longer practical to have infantrymen armoured.
The invention of carbon fibre, modern hard ceramics and various plastic compounds are suitable for light armour which is effective in many circumstances. Kevlar, Technora and Nomex are Aramids, which are long-chain aromatic polyamides. They are used to make bullet resistant vests and bullet resistant face masks. The PASGT helmet and vest used by United States military forces since the early 1980s both have Kevlar as a main component, as do their replacements. Most of these items have padding on the inside to act as shock-absorbers, and to increase comfort during while being worn.
So, with the lighter weight and increased stopping-power of personal armour, the modern soldier is once again protected against most of the weapons of the day.
In December 2009, during the War in Afghanistan, a British soldier in southern Helmand Province, survived a shot to the back during an operation to clear insurgents from a village, protected by the body armor kit he was wearing.
