Papal name

A papal name is a special name (regnal name) which is chosen by the pope when he is elected. 
In the early church, popes were known by their ordinary names, such as Pope Adeodatus, Pope Formosus and Pope Hyginus.
The practice of choosing a papal name started in the sixth century. At birth, Pope John II was named after the Roman god Mercury. When he was elected pope, he chose to be called by a Christian name.
Papal names became customary in the 10th century. In 996, the first German pope was chosen; and he changed his name from Bruno to Gregory. He is known as Pope Gregory V.
Every pope since the 16th century is known by a different name than the one he was given at birth.
The papal names have included John (23 times), Gregory (16), Clement (14), Innocent (13), Leo (13) and Pius (12). 
The first papal name to be repeated was Pope Sixtus. There have been four others.
As with kings and emperors, a Roman numeral is added if the Pope chooses a name that another pope has used before -- for example, Pope John Paul II decided to be known by the same name as the pope who came before him.

Harp seal

The harp seal or saddleback seal is a species of earless seal. They live in the northernmost Atlantic Ocean and parts of the Arctic Ocean. It now belongs to the monotypic genus "Pagophilus". Its scientific name, "Pagophilus groenlandicus", means "ice-lover from Greenland". 
The harp seal has a black face with silvery-gray body. Its eyes are pure black. It has black harp or wishbone-shaped markings on the back. They show little sexual dimorphism. This means there is little difference between the males and females. The baby harp seal (pup) has a yellow-white coat at birth. After three days, the coat turns white and stays white for about 12 days. Adult harp seals grow up to be 1.7 to 2.0 m (5 to 6 feet) long and weigh from 140 to 190 kg (300 to 400 pounds).
Harp seals like to swim in the ocean. They spend little time on land. They are very social animals. They can be very noisy, as well. They will form large colonies where they spend a great deal of time. Many harp seals are able to live up to 30 years in the wild.
On the ice, pups call their mothers by "bawling" and "mumble" while playing with others. Adults "growl" and "warble" to warn off others. Underwater, adults use more than 19 call types during courting and mating.
Females mature sexually at age five to six. Then each year, they bear one pup. This is usually in late February. 
Newborn pups weigh around and are long. After birth, the mother only feeds that pup. During the 12 day nursing period, the mother does not eat. She losies up to per day. Harp seal milk has up to 48% fat, so pups gain over per day. 
Weaning is sudden. The mother turns from nursing to promiscuous mating. She leaves the pup behind on the ice. While courtship starts on the ice, mating usually takes place in the water.
Pups are unable to swim or find food until seven to eight weeks old or until the ice melts. This leaves them open to polar bears and other predators. Because they cannot eat, they lose up to 50% of their weight. As many as 30% of pups die during their first year.

Ringed seal

The ringed seal ("Pusa hispida"), also known as the jar seal and as netsik or nattiq by the Inuit, is an earless seal. They live in the Arctic and sub-Arctic areas. The ringed seal is a small seal. They are rarely greater than 1.5 m in length. 
They have a distinctive patterning of dark spots surrounded by light grey rings. It is the most abundant and wide-ranging ice seal in the northern hemisphere. The live throughout the Arctic Ocean, into the Bering Sea and Okhotsk Sea as far south as the northern coast of Japan in the Pacific, and throughout the North Atlantic coasts of Greenland and Scandinavia as far south as Newfoundland, and include two freshwater subspecies in northern Europe. Ringed seals are one of the main prey of polar bears. They have long been a part of the diet of indigenous people of the Arctic.
The ringed seal is the smallest and most common seal in the Arctic. They have a small head, short cat-like snout, and a plump body. Their coat is dark with silver rings on their back and sides with a silver belly. Depending on subspecies and condition, adult size can range from 100 to 175 cm (40-69 in) and weigh from 32 to 140 kg (70-308 lbs). The seal averages about 5 ft (1.5 m) long with a weight of about 50–70 kg (110-150 lbs). Their small front flippers have claws more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick that are used to make breathing holes through 6.5 ft (2 m) thick ice.
Ringed seals live throughout the Arctic Ocean. They can be found in the Baltic Sea, the Bering Sea and the Hudson Bay. They like to rest on ice floe and will move farther north for denser ice. One subspecies can be found in freshwater.
Females reach sexual maturity at 4 years. Males do not reach maturity until 7 years old. During the spring breeding season, females make lairs in the thick ice and give birth in these structures. Females give birth to a single pup in March or April after a 9 month gestation period. Pups are weaned after one month. They build up a thick layer of blubber.
Females usually begin mating in late April. Males will roam the ice for a mate. When found, the male and female may spend several days together before mating. Then the male looks for another mate.
Ringed seals live about 25 to 30 years. They are solitary animals. They separate themselves from each other by hundreds of yards.
Ringed seals eat a wide variety of small prey. They eat 72 species of fish and invertebrates. Their prey of choice includes mysids, shrimp, arctic cod, and herring. While feeding, ringed seals dive to depths of 35 to 150 ft (10–45 m). In the summer ringed seals feed along edge of the sea-ice for polar cod. In shallow water they feed on smaller cod. Ringed seals may also eat herring, smelt, whitefish, sculpin, perch, and crustaceans.
Ringed seal are an important food item in particular for polar bears. During the pupping season, arctic fox and glaucous gulls take ringed seal pups born outside lairs. Killer whales, Greenland sharks and occasionally Atlantic walruses prey upon them in the water.

Brave and Bold

Brave and Bold is a boys' book written by Horatio Alger, Jr. It was serialized (published in parts) beginning on August 5, 1872 in the New York "Weekly". Also published in the same issue was Alger's poem "Friar Anselmo". "Brave and Bold" was then published in book form by A. K. Loring of Boston in 1873. The story was serialized in "Reader", an English magazine, in 1872, and was one of Alger's few stories to be so published.
Alger had lost some of his steam as the 1870s approached. He had made his literary name in exposing the horrors of life for street children in books such as "Ragged Dick" (1866). As the years passed, the government had taken on these horrors, studies were being conducted, and the plight of street children was being relieved. As a result, Alger was left without a literary subject. Boys' tastes were changing. They knew everything they needed to know about street boys from Alger's many novels about the poor. They wanted cowboys and Indians. Alger's publisher and his editor urged him ramp up the excitement in his books. Alger agreed, but let it be known that his moralizing would remain at its usual high level. 
"Brave and Bold" was the first in a new series of Alger novels published by Loring, and the first in which sex rears its head. Before "Brave and Bold", the girls of the hero's age were sisters or simply prop figures. In this new book, Hester Paine, the lovely daughter of Millville's most prominent citizen and the reigning village belle, becomes a source of fascination and contention for "factory boy" hero Robert Rushton and his nemesis, the rich, snobbish, kid glove-wearing youth Halbert Davis. 
"Brave and Bold" hit a new high in Alger's work, according Edwin Hoyt, but Hoyt describes the story as a "fiasco". Gary Scharnhorst describes it as "horrifying", and lists a shooting, a stabbing, and a suicide among the book's elements. The book was reviewed by a reader of the children's magazine "St. Nicholas"; he described it as "of the sensational order" and was glad he did not meet its characters in real life. This was the last review of an Alger work published by the prestigious magazine. The book initiated the controversy over making Alger's works available to the young.

The Māori are the first people to live in New Zealand.
Their Polynesian ancestors came to New Zealand between 800 and 1300 AD. Where the Maori arrived from is still unclear and there are many theories, but one of them is that they arrived from somewhere in tropical Polynesia, perhaps from the Cook Islands or the Society Islands. About 600,000 Māori live in New Zealand today.
During World War II, Māori soldiers were famous as brave warriors because they won many difficult battles and stayed strong in the face of danger.
Before Europeans came to New Zealand, the Māori did not need a name for themselves as a people. After Europeans came to New Zealand, the indigenous people called themselves "Māori", which means "normal" or "ordinary" in the Māori language. They called other people, especially those who came from Britain, "Pākehā". Today, in New Zealand English "Pākehā" is sometimes used as a name for New Zealand Europeans.

<doc id="359987" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=359987" title="Dido, Queen of Carthage">
Dido, Queen of Carthage

Ancient Greek and Roman writers said that Dido was the founder and first Queen of Carthage. Carthage was a city in the country now known as Tunisia. Dido lived in the 9th century BC (about 3000 years ago). Some parts of her life may be true. Other parts are myths. She is best known from the story about her in the "Aeneid" by the Roman poet Virgil. In some writings about her, she is called Alyssa or Elissa. She was also worshipped as a goddess in ancient Carthage.
The oldest story about Dido was written by Timaeus. He was an ancient Greek historian who lived in the 3rd century BC. One hundred years later, a Roman historian, Pompeius Trogus, wrote about her. His story about her is now lost, but a later Roman historian, Justin, wrote a summary of Trogus' story. In the stories by Timaeus and Trogus, Dido was the daughter of the King of Tyre (a city in the country now known as Lebanon). She was married to Acerbas who was a priest of Hercules. When Dido's brother Pygmalion killed Acerbas, Dido ran away. She took some of her people with her. They went first to Cyprus, and then to the north coast of Africa in the place now known as Tunisia. 
When they got to Africa, Dido asked the Berber ruler, a man named Iarbus, if she could buy some land to for her people to start a city. He said that she could buy as much land as she could cover with the skin of a dead ox. She told her people to cut the skin into very thin strips. They laid all the strips out to mark the borders. This gave them a very big piece of land. Dido and her people built a city on the land. The city was named Carthage, and Dido was its first queen. Carthage grew and became a very rich city. Many Berbers also went to live there. 
When he saw what a rich city Carthage was, Iarbus wanted to marry Dido. He told her that if she did not marry him, he would make war on Carthage. Dido did not want to marry Iarbus. She still loved her husband . Before her wedding to Iarbus, she built a large fire. She told him that the fire was a ceremony to honor Acerbas. She said that when the ceremony was finished, Iarbus would be her new husband. Instead, she climbed onto the pyre where the fire was burning. Then she killed herself with a sword. After she died, the people of Carthage worshipped her as a goddess. Carthage stayed a very rich and powerful city for 600 years. It was destroyed by Rome in 146 BC.
Dido is most well known today for the story told about her in Books 3 and 4 of Virgil's "Aeneid". Virgil's story about the early life of Dido is very like those told by Timaeus and Trogus. But his story of how she died is very different. In Virgil's story, Aeneas, a prince from the ancient city of Troy, goes to Carthage after losing a war against the Greeks (the Trojan War). Aeneas and Dido fall in love. Aeneas decides to stay in Carthage with Dido. But the god Jupiter sends Mercury to tell Aeneas that he must leave Carthage and go to Italy. Aeneas does not want to go, but knows he must do what Jupiter asks. He and his men sail away from Carthage. Dido is very sad and very angry. She builds a large fire to burn all the things that belonged to Aeneas. Then she climbs to the top of the fire and kills herself with the sword that she gave Aeneas when he first came to Carthage.
Most people say that Virgil was the first writer to make up the story about Aeneas and Dido. Others think that he got the idea from a long poem by Gnaeus Naevius called "" ("The Punic Wars"). Most of Naevius's poem is lost, so it is hard to know for sure. 
Since Virgil's time, many plays and operas have been written about his story of Aeneas and Dido. Christopher Marlowe wrote a play about them in 1583. It was called "Dido Queen of Carthage". Henry Purcell composed an opera about them in 1688 called "Dido and Aeneas". 
The Italian poet Pietro Metastasio also used Virgil's story for a libretto (the story and words for an opera). It was called "". (Its title means "Dido " in Italian.) The first opera to use Metastasio's libretto was composed by Domenico Sarro in 1724. In the next 100 years more than 40 operas by other composers used this libretto.

Anita Tsoy

Anita "Anna" Sergeyevna Tsoy (; born 7 February 1971, Moscow) is a Russian singer-songwriter of Korean descent.
Her grandfather, seeking free education, emigrated from Korea to the Russian Far East. He, his wife and his children were later caught up in the 1937 deportation of the "Koryo-saram" to Central Asia. Anita's mother was born in 1944 in Tashkent, Uzbek SSR, Soviet Union. She successfully graduated from the Moscow State University and became a chemistry doctor.
She did everything she could to make her daughter educated in all kinds of arts . Anita's favourite one became music. She began violin lessons at a young age; she later studied piano, flute, and guitar. 
She wasn't a loved one at school. Many classmates, being children of influential parents, often abused her. Most teachers weren't as friendly to her as they were to the other classmates.
When she became an adult, a tragedy happened: her mother was branded a "class enemy" in the 1970s in response to her record of speaking out in support of Nobel Peace Prize-winning dissident Andrei Sakharov. For her dissent she was briefly committed to a mental institution. She became a permanent invalid. 
After leaving school Anita attended the teacher training college, then law school at Moscow State University, where she met her husband Sergey P. Tsoy.
After graduation, rather than becoming a teacher or lawyer, she began saving up money in order to launch a singing career, while her husband began working as a press secretary for Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov in 1994. Her first album "Polyot" (Полёт; "Flight") was released in 1997; she kept it a secret from her husband until after she had already signed the contract with her production company.
In 1998 her second album, named "Черный лебедь" ("The Black Swan") was released and in 1999 a concert show "Черный лебедь или храм любви" ("The Black Swan or a Love Palace") was held in the concert hall "Rossiya". This show was accepted as "Best Show of the Year" and Anita won an "Ovation" She went to the United States in 2003 to record an English-language album, where she worked with cinematic composer Lee Holdridge; while there, she was offered a five-year contract as a solo vocalist in the Cirque du Soleil, but turned it down in order to return to Russia and be near her family.
She records her third Russian dance solo-album "1000000 минут" ("1000000 Minutes") in 2003, which was introduced to public in the "Elevator" club, a former factory in Moscow. In 2005 a major show-concert "ANITA" was held in the "Rossiya" Concert Hall, Moscow, featuring high technology decorations like large LCD-screens and fountains on the stage. The show was considered to be one of the most successful ones in Russia and was released on DVD by Universal Music.
Anita Tsoy records her fourth album "На восток" ("To The East") in 2007 and changed her image greatly since the 2003; she turns to manga-anime style. In autumn of the same year she performs with her "To The East" show, which attracted more than ten thousand people. Following the show, the DVD-recording of this live concert was released.
Both "ANITA" and "To The East" shows are considered to be one of the best live-performances in Russia and the recordings of these concerts were shown on Channel One, Muz-TV and other influentable Russian channels.
Anita recorded 5 albums in total and won more than 10 major awards for both performing and charity during her 13-year career as a solo artist.

Rigidly rotating disk paradox

In theoretical physics, a branch of physics, the rigidly rotating disk paradox, sometimes called the Ehrenfest paradox, is a paradox concerning a rotating disk. Basically, the paradox says that when a disk (or any circular object in general) is rotated, it will have a smaller circumference than 2πr, because the radius will remain the same, but the circumference is shortened due to the Lorentz contraction. For a more detailed explanation, see below.
If the rotating disk has an angular velocity of "ω", and a radius of "R", then the circumference of the disk is "ω"·R. So the circumference will undergo a Lorentz contraction of 
formula_1. However, the radius, R, will not undergo a Lorentz contraction since it is perpendicular to the direction of motion.
Therefore, the circumference divided by the diameter will end up being a little bit less than formula_2.
The simpler definition is given by the following. To an observer "X" riding on the edge of the rotating disk, the effects of high-speed motion are still in place. So, if "X" were to crawl along the circumference with a ruler and measure the circumference, his ruler will be shortened (due to the Lorentz contraction) and he will have to lay out his ruler "more times" to measure the circumference. Therefore, he will measure the circumference to be "greater" than he would measure it to be if the disk were stationary.
If an observer "Y" were to sit on the radius of the rotating disk, he will measure the radius to be the same as he would measure it to be if the disk were stationary, since the radius is not affected by the Lorentz contraction (the radius is perpendicular to the direction of motion). Therefore, when observers "X" and "Y" compare their measurements, they find that
formula_3
In verbal terms this means "The circumference is greater than 2π times the radius". So, the circumference and the radius are not proportional by 2π in this case.
In differential geometry, there exists a certain type of mathematical plane called a hyperbolic plane. In it, if you draw a normal circle, the radius will remain the same, but the circumference will be greater than 2πr. Physicists began to realize that the accelerated angular motion of the disk caused a curvature in spacetime, therefore distorting the normal flat geometric plane, causing the circumference to be greater than 2πr.
Underlying this explanation is the fact that Euclidean geometry is not the actual geometry of space, but an approximation which works well at the level of human life.
Using an ingenious argument concerning the equivalence principle, Albert Einstein showed that the curvature in spacetime caused by the rotated disk could be a logical explanation for gravity. For more information on this topic, see Gravity and the rotating disk.

Anal stage

The anal stage is the second stage in Sigmund Freud's psychosexual development theory. Freud believed the personality developed through several stages during childhood. These stages focused on the erogenous zones. The anal stage occurs between ages 18 months to three years. This is the period when a child toilet trains. According to Freud, pleasure is derived from controlling the anus (the primary erogenous zone) and the bladder. A toilet training conflict or fixation results in a rigid or disordered personality.

Pyre

A pyre, also known as a funeral pyre, is a structure used for burning a body. The word "pyre" comes from the Greek word for "fire". Pyres are built outdoors. They are usually made from wood. The body is placed on top of the pyre or under it. Then the pyre is set on fire. Pyres are still used for funerals in some parts of the world. They are also used for other types of ceremonies. In those ceremonies, there is a big fire, but a body is not burned. Historically, pyres have also been used to kill people by burning them alive.
The Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist religions still use pyres for the cremation of dead people. This form of funeral is thousands of years old. However, it is no longer legal in many countries. The ancient Greeks and ancient Romans used funeral pyres. The Vikings also used them. Viking funeral pyres were usually built on boats floating in the sea.
People sometimes use pyres to make a big fire or bonfire but they do not burn a real body. These types of pyres are used for celebrations or to remember a person or a special event. Pyres are often used in Guy Fawkes Night celebrations in the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries. In Denmark and Germany people light pyres to celebrate the summer solstice (the longest day of the year). People light pyres in Switzerland to celebrate their National Day.
Farmers sometimes use pyres to destroy the bodies of dead animals. They especially use them when the animals have died of a disease. This helps prevent the spread of the disease to other animals.
In the past, pyres were sometimes used to execute people. The people were burned while they were still alive. Often the person was tied to a stake (a very big stick) on top of the pyre. This type of execution was known as "burning at the stake". Joan of Arc died in this way.

Danger triangle of the face

The danger triangle of the face is a triangle with two corners at both corners of the mouth and one corner in the middle of the nose between the eyes. The way the blood flows to the human nose is special, so it is possible (but not likely) for infections to spread directly to the brain from a cut, scratch or a popped pimple.
The path this infection would take would be back up the wrong way of a vein (called the ophthalmic veins) that runs from an empty hollow in the middle of the head at the bottom of the skull called the cavernous sinus. The cavernous sinus lies partly inside the skull, under the layers of protection against infection. The cavernous sinus is a way a lot of blood flows away from the brain back down the neck.
Many people wrongly assume that the veins of the head do not contain one-way valves like other veins of the circulatory system. In fact, almost all people, but not all, have valves in the veins of the face. But even with one way valves, blood flow between the facial vein and cavernous sinus can spread infection from the face; it is the direction of blood flow that is important.

Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)

This is a list of movies by year that they received an Oscar. Also listed are the other nominations for best documentary short subject. 
Note: A press release by AMPAS in 2005 says that "Documentary Short Subject winners "Benjy" (1951) and "Neighbours" (1952) are among a group of films that not only competed, but won Academy Awards in what were clearly inappropriate categories. "Benjy", directed by Fred Zinnemann and narrated by Henry Fonda, is the fictional tale of a crippled boy. The film was used as a fundraiser for the Los Angeles Orthopedic Hospital. ... Norman McLaren's "Neighbours", which today would compete in the Animated Short category, used "pixilation" – animation using living people - to create an allegory of war."

Emil Jannings, for example, was given the Best Actor award for his work in both "The Way of All Flesh" and "The Last Command". Moreover, Charlie Chaplin and Warner Brothers each received an Honorary Award.

Freshwater crab

Freshwater crabs are crabs that live in fresh water, mostly in the tropics and subtropics. About 1300 species of freshwater crab have been described. In total, there are about 6700 species of crab. It is thought that there are many undescribed species of freshwater crab; there may be up to 2155 such species. Freshwater crabs show different behaviour than other crabs. Other crabs release a large number of larvae into the environment. These larvae need to cope on their own. In contrast, freshwater crabs care for the young. Many freshwater crabs are endemic to small areas. This means there if there is a threat of the area of dissapearing, this also applies to the crab, which becomes threatened with extinction.

Spotted eagle ray

The spotted eagle ray, ("Aetobatus narinari"), is a species of cartilaginous fish, in the Eagle ray group. It can be found in tropical waters, including Hawaii, the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of west Africa, Oceania, and the Indian Ocean.
Spotted Eagle Rays are around 17 to 35 cm wide at birth, but adults can be as long as 16 ft (5 meters), and have the wingspan of 3 meters (10 ft). An adult weighs 180 to 225 kg. The heaviest ever recorded weighed 230 kg. They have flat disk-shaped bodies, the top is dark blue or black in colour and is covered in white spots, and the belly is white. Spotted Eagle Rays also have flat snouts which look like a duck's bill. 
They have a long tail which is longer than most other ray's tails, and they have 2-6 venomous spines right behind their pelvic fins.
Spotted Eagle Rays prefer to swim in waters with the temperature of 24 to 27 °C (75 to 81 °F), and are more active during high tides. They are shy animals and usually avoid humans, but they have been seen leaping out of the water onto boats and landing on people. They search for their food by digging their snouts into the sand on the sea beds. Groups of them are made up of around 6 members swimming in the same direction, at exactly the same speed.
Spotted Eagle Rays eat crustaceans like shrimps, prawns and crabs, molluscs like octopuses, clams and oysters.
Spotted Eagle Rays are viviparous, meaning they give live birth. Females are pregnant for around 1 year before giving birth to about 2-4 young which are 17 to 35 cm long. Spotted Eagle Rays mature at the age of 4 to 6 years old. Spotted Eagle Rays live for around 15–20 years.
The predators of the Spotted Eagle Ray are mainly sharks like the tiger shark, the lemon shark, the bull shark, the great hammerhead shark, and the silvertip shark. These sharks are known to follow female Spotted Eagle Rays during the breeding season and eat the newborn babies.
Spotted Eagle Rays live in shallow, coastal waters and coral reefs in tropical regions, including Hawaii, the Gulf of Mexico, Oceania, west Africa, the Indian Ocean and the west coast of the United States of America. They are found down to the depths of 80 meters. They can be found in the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of North Carolina, down to Florida, in the Gulf Stream, in the Caribbean, and down pass the southern part of Brazil. In can also be found in the Pacific Ocean, from the Red Sea to South Africa, and northern Japan and Australia.
The Spotted Eagle Ray is also known as the ""White-spotted Eagle Ray", the "Bonnet Skate", the "Bonnet Ray", the "Duck-billed Ray", and the "Spotted Duck-billed Ray"".

, also known as the Korea Strait, is a narrow body of water between Japan and South Korea. The name is used in two ways. It is used generally to describe the ocean area between Korea and Japan; and it also identifies the sea passage between the islands of Kyushu and Tsushima.
The strait links the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan in the northwest Pacific Ocean. Tsushima Island is between the western channel (Korea Strait) and the eastern channel (Tsushima Strait). 
Depending on usage, the northern shore of the strait is the eastern coast of the Korean peninsula or it may mean the eastern coast of Tsushima. The southern shores of the strait are the western coasts of Kyūshū and Honshū. 
A warm current ("Tsushima-kairyū") runs through the straight from south to north.

Palenquero

Palenquero is a Spanish-African Creole language spoken in Colombia. Is it spoken primarily in the Northern and the Caribbean parts of Colombia; the palenque villages and their diasporas.
Palenquero, just like in the other Spanish-Based Caribbean Creoles, has influences from the contact between European masters and African slaves. In the case of Palenquero, it has been accepted that the maroons (escaped slaves) moved in somewhere in the mountains, along with some Native Americans. The maroons had very little contact with their masters, which led to them having to blend their African substrate languages with the Spanish European ones.
Palenquero has a lot of African influence in its sounds, phonetics, syntax, grammar, vocabulary, and a lot of words.
Lord's Prayer
The African languages that have had the most dominant influence on Palenquero is the languages of the Bantu, specifically the Kongo.
Cuban Creole Oriental is very similar to Palenquero. They even share some words.
Many of the Spanish-based Creoles can be compared to the other Creoles of the Americas, where there has been the blending of African and European languages.

<doc id="360774" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=360774" title="Vietnamese alphabet">
Vietnamese alphabet

This page describes the alphabet () of the Vietnamese language in use around the world.
Here is the total set of characters for the lowercase letters:
The little ₫ is just the Dong (Dollar) sign - most people just write VND for Vietnamese Dong - the currency of Vietnam.
This makes the useful alphabet 89+ letters.
I.e.
This letter is a word: 'ở, it means "at" (or "where", "place").
The main letters from the Latin alphabet:
a, b,c,d,e,g,h,i,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,x,y
ô, ơ, â, ă, ê, ư, đ
This changed set of characters makes new alphabet letters for use in the Vietnamese language. They are an extension to the set of Latin characters already used. English doesn't extend the alphabet. English just uses the same written characters over again, to denote different (letter) sounds. For example: ape, angry, all, art, aorta, and apple. For the Vietnamese language, sounds are split up with their own letter/character changes.
'đ' is just the same as the English d.
'd' in the Vietnamese alphabet is y (in Southern Vietnam)
and,
'd' is also z (in Northern Vietnam).
'a, â, ă' are just different ah letters.
'u, ư' are different oo letters - never, ever an uh/ah sound.
'e, ê' are just eh and ey - but they may sound different to English e in use.
'o, ô, ơ' are just oh, oe, and ur - but they still all sound like o's from English.
Note: i and y are essentially the same vowel (and may be exchanged in some situations)
The alphabet is taught in Vietnam's schools with these letters
a, b, c, d, e, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, x, y - ô, ơ, â, ă, ê, ư, đ 
Vietnamese schools teach the alphabet with these 29 letters. The total number of possible letters is much higher if diacritical marks are added.
The F, J, W, Z not used native words, Only English use native words F, J, W, Z.
These are the tone rules for vowels with different sounds. It's like music where only the correct sound can come from the instrument. It doesn't matter which instrument, as long as the sound follows the rules.
Note: This is a spoken language so musical pitch or lilt is not the most changed sound quality. Different voices have different musical pitches. What the speaker will change is the intensity, and time given to the sound parts for each letter (or word). If a speaker uses strong pitch changes, it will probably be for pronunciation.
Before, the alphabet was arranged from 'a to z' by foreign dictionaries, it included two letter sounds. The letters are like two letter sounds in English. 'Ch' in mechanic, or Christmas are good examples. In Viet characters the 'j'(jeh) sound has an equal (sound) that is written as 'tr'(jeh). Letters like 'Tr' used to be in every dictionary's order right in between the other alphabet letters. Another sound is 'ph'. 'Ph' is very famous - it's used in 'phở' the most famous Vietnamese soup in the world. 'Ph' is an 'f' sound, just like in English - 'phone'. 
In addition to the normal alphabet consonants, there are nine possible double-letters and one triple-letter.
Because of a relationship with East Asian languages (Japanese,Chinese etc.) the Vietnamese words can be moved around in their order. The reversal of the syllable-words moves them to another position in the dictionary. Also, the syllable-words can be held behind different syllable-words - like the articles in English. It's best to use a computer query to find them.
Young Vietnamese learners will spend a lot of time with this alphabet. Correction is very common. The need for correction is used in many comedies about uneducated people. Comedies about foreigners are becoming very common too. 
The reason for all the attention is how quickly the meaning will change. To say "I have a sore head, somewhere" ("đầu của tôi là đau đâu!" in Vietnamese) is nearly impossible for (foreign) learners on their first day. A learner will only hear 'dow, dow dow' or 'dough, dough, dough' or 'dow, dough, dough' which does not help when listening. The same problem can be stated in English - 'four forks for foreigners' foreheads forthwith!' 
Each word in Vietnamese can be identical to another word, except for the sounds/tones/letter-changes. The sound is also identical to the ears of English speakers that allow for expression (sound changes) still. 
See: Vietnam Eyes lesson on YouTube
The world includes Vietnam! So, the other letters 'j, f, w and z' are now OK to use in many places - on billboards, posters, T-shirts... But, if you work for any type of Vietnamese authority or association, then limit their use until the authority declares them as acceptable letters. But, the other alphabets that are used in English might not be accepted. For example: the Greek alphabet is very useful for English speakers - but in Vietnam it can lack meaning - it would be a decoration for the general population. Educated people will know more letters from the Greek alphabet.
Vietnamese used to be written in Chinese characters. A variety for Vietnamese is used in traditional culture. Many Chinese speakers find Vietnamese easy to grasp. The combination of two words is very common to Chinese. Example: phat am, Hong Kong/Xiong Gong etc. .
'Diphthongs' are the next most important step to understanding the use of Vietnamese letters. The combination of toned vowels as "dipthongs" and "tripthongs" makes the Vietnamese language very fast. Some phrases can be spoken clearly without a strong clarity from consonants. It's very hard for English speakers to follow the combinations of sounds, especially vowels.
The Vietnamese keyboard is always virtual (in software). Nobody can buy a computer keyboard for Vietnam, in Vietnam. The common QWERTY keyboard is used in Vietnam. Software programs for Vietnamese characters are very common.
The webpage is usually set to include the UTF-8 standard when using the Vietnamese alphabet. If the design of the characters is strange the designer of a web-page will set the font to plain "Arial". Some special fonts have been made for Vietnamese alphabets.
Some software is free to use. An open-source software program for the Vietnamese keyboard has already been written.
There are a few virtual keyboard systems to use.

Trani

Trani is a seaport city in the Apulia region of southern Italy. It is on the Adriatic Sea. Its main industries are wine-making, fishing, and mining. The number of people living in Trani in 2011 was 53,940.
The old name of Trani was or Tirenum. An old myth says that Tirenus built the city. Tirenus was the son of Diomedes, a hero in ancient Greece who fought in the Trojan War. The city was on an ancient Roman map called the "". It was the first map to show this city. The map was made in the 3rd century. At first, Trani was a very small city and not very important. It started to grow and be more important in the 9th century. At that time, the Lombards (a Germanic people) ruled Trani. Later, the Byzantine Empire ruled the city. 
The Normans took over Trani from the Byzantine Empire in the 11th century. From the 11th century until the 13th century, Trani was a rich and very important city. This was especially true when the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II ruled Trani. Trani was an important port for the Knights Templar during the Crusades. People came from all over Italy to do business there. Many churches, palaces, and castles were built in Trani during this time. Many Jews lived in Trani at this time. There were 200 Jewish families and four big synagogues in the city. Isaiah di Trani, one of the most famous rabbis of the Middle Ages, lived there.
After Frederick II died in 1250, there was trouble in Trani. In the next 300 years, there were wars between the Angevins, Aragon and Venice over who should rule Trani. The city became poorer and less important. Trani was almost destroyed during the French Revolutionary Wars at the end of the 18th century. Many people in the town were against the French Revolution. In March 1799, they rioted and killed many members of the city's most important families. When the French army saw this, they attacked the city on April 1, 1799. The army killed many people and burned Trani's buildings. Over 1000 people died in the riots and the French attack. 
Trani began to grow again in the middle of the 19th century. It grew even more in the 20th century. By 2011, 53,940 people lived in the city.
Today, the main industries in Trani are wine-making, fishing, and mining. Trani is famous for a sweet wine called '. The grapes for this wine are grown in the Trani countryside. Fruit and olives for making olive oil are other important crops for Trani. There are mines for bauxite just outside the city. There are also quarries for a special kind of rock called ' (Trani stone). Trani has special factories for cutting this stone. Many buildings in Trani and in southern Italy are made from this stone. Trani stone was used to build the ports in Malta and Egypt. Trani also has some small factories for making clothes and shoes.

Provincial city (Vietnam)

A province in Vietnam () is the region of authority. If the province is in the city (), then it will have districts (). If the city has some country districts attached, then they are separated as counties ().
Inside the city, the districts break down into smaller divisions called city wards (). If the county is outside the city, or in a country province, then that county will be broken down into smaller divisional areas ().
There are more divisions in every province:
Five city provinces are directly under the government of Vietnam. Administratively, each city is divided into districts and counties. 
Each city has smaller level administrative units, including the districts, wards, communes, and areas. Administration includes the total area in kilometers square, an official census of the city's population (per million people), and the density of people (per kilometers square). Concentration is usually in the inner city, including more people, with closer living. The country districts have less people.
Administration of each city is done through the City People's Council, with representatives elected directly every five years. Elected representatives decide the plans for economic development, culture, education, and all other responsibilities. The Head of the People's Council consists of a chairman, a vice chairman, and permanent members. Councils are under the supervision and guidance from the National Assembly Standing Committee.
The City People's Council elects the People's Committee, it is the agency directly responsible for the management of the political, security, economic, and cultural interests of the city. The departments of the People's Committee will manage specific areas, such as health, education, investment, justice, finance . In addition, the People's Committee also manages a number of corporations in the city.
The government of Vietnam names at least one level of every location a commune. There is a slight difference between an active commune (Xa), and an administrative commune (Xa Huyen). Some communes are very active as cooperatives. In other areas (and in other divisions) the residents have more to do than just commune activities. It's a difference created by the market-economy. Not everyone elects to work for the commune - in commune jobs.
Foreigners don't normally invest in the cultural homes directly. And, little or no re-gentrification has been occurring after progress. Hems are different. Hems are transformed into beautiful villas/towns. Some hems have a full circuit of interior roadways that allow for better communities.
Many cities are beautified in arrangement between departments, province, district, ward, local committees, and residents. However, this is the source of numerous disputes/arguments. The management of the activity doesn't satisfy all the people involved. But, some people are happy with the result - some people choose to get paid to demolish their own house for the progress of a city plan. 
Older residencies can be left intact for various reasons.
Every division is described so that a committee can manage it. In some provinces committees have established industrial parks. Foreign investment is directed at larger divisions (provinces) who can grant tax and regulation help and incentives.

<doc id="360792" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=360792" title="Containerization">
Containerization

Containerization is a system of freight transport based on a range of steel containers ("shipping containers", "ISO containers" etc.). Containers are built to standardized sizes. They can be loaded and unloaded, stacked, transported over long distances. They can be transferred from one mode of transport to another—ships, rail and semi-trailer trucks—without being opened. The system developed after World War II. It led to greatly reduced transport costs, and supported a great increase in international trade.
Containerization has its origins in coal mining regions in England from the late 18th century onwards. "Loose boxes" were used to containerize coal from the late 1780s, at places like the Bridgewater Canal. They were used for moving coal on and off barges.
By the 1830s, railroads on several continents were carrying containers that could be transferred to other modes of transport. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway in the United Kingdom was one such. "Simple timber boxes, four to a wagon, they were used to convey coal from the Lancashire collieries to Liverpool, where they were transferred to horse drawn carts by crane". By the 1840s, iron boxes were in use as well as wooden ones. The early 1900s saw closed container boxes designed for movement between road and rail.
In the United Kingdom, several railway companies were using similar containers by the beginning of the 20th century and in the 1920s the Railway Clearing House standardized the RCH container. Five- or ten-foot-long, wooden and non-stackable, these early standard containers were a great success.
From 1926 to 1947 in the US, the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railway carried motor carrier vehicles and shippers' vehicles loaded on flatcars between Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Chicago, Illinois. Beginning in 1929, Seatrain Lines carried railroad boxcars on its sea vessels between New York and Cuba. 
During World War II the Australian Army used containers. These non-stackable containers were about the size of the later 20 foot ISO container and perhaps made mainly of wood.
Toward the end of World War II, the United States Army used containers to speed the loading and unloading of transport ships. The army used the term "transporters" for shipping household goods of officers in the field. A "transporter" was a reusable container, long, wide, and high, made of rigid steel with a carrying capacity of 9,000 pounds. 
During the Korean War the transporter was evaluated for handling sensitive military equipment and, proving effective, was approved for broader use. 
In 1952 the army began using the term CONEX, short for "Container Express". The first major shipment of CONEXes, containing engineering supplies and spare parts, was made by rail from the Columbus General Depot in Georgia to the Port of San Francisco, then by ship to Yokohama, Japan, and then to Korea. 
In 1955, a trucking company owner, Malcom McLean, worked with engineer Keith Tantlinger to develop the modern container. The challenge was to design a shipping container that could be loaded onto ships and held securely for long sea voyages. The result was a tall by wide box in -long units constructed from thick corrugated steel.
The design had a twistlock mechanism on top each of the four corners. This meant the container could be easily secured and lifted by cranes. After helping McLean make the successful design, Tantlinger convinced him to give the patented designs to the industry. This began international standardization of shipping containers.
The U.S. Department of Defense standardized an 8'×8' cross section container in multiples of 10' lengths for military use. This was exactly the standard proposed by McLean and Tantlinger in Britain, and it was rapidly adopted for shipping purposes.
There are many variations on the standard 8'x8'x10' size, but the use of containers for transport is now world-wide. In addition to ships, containers are universally used on planes for international air transport. Countries with large rail networks still use containers for much of their freight transport.
Ports round the world have been adapted to freight transport by container. The ships that carry containers are huge, and ports must have depth and size to dock ships. China is by far the world's largest user of container transport. Container ships cannot get down the Thames to London, so a modern container port was built at Felixtowe on the Suffolk coast. The Port of Felixtowe is the UK's largest container port, and carries 35% of the UK container cargo. However, it is only the 29th busiest container port in the world. 
World #1 container port is Shanghai, China; #2 is Singapore, and #3 is Rotterdam, Netherlands. Top U.S. container port is South Louisiana at #9, just in front of Houston. These rankings are by millions of tons.
The use of containers has caused increased efficiency in loading and unloading. Also, there have been changes in short-term storage and handling in ports.

I would like permission to run the AntiVandalBot program that we once had under GoblinBot4. After talking to others on IRC I think this would be best done from the Toolserver on what is called a Multi Maintainer Project where we would be able to add and remove users and never have to worry about one user retiring or leaving and losing important tools such as this. There is also the possibility of running other bots important to the wiki from the same project (I am thinking the project itself will be called SimpleBots or just SimpleWiki). The bot itself and the project would be set up over the next week and would not be fully run without testing first. It is possible that I would run the bot for testing from my personal toolserver account (jamesur) if the MMP is not set up yet. We also have at least 2 other users who have shown interest in helping to maintain the project and there are a couple others who I am going to talk to who were involved in running GoblinBot (Chenzw and ChrisG for sure). I already have the code used for goblin bot, last updated a month ago by ChenzW. I have created the account [[User:SimpleVandalBot]] for the bot itself.

Dinosaur Provincial Park

Dinosaur Provincial Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is about two and a half hours drive southeast of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
The park is in the valley of the Red Deer River, which is noted for its badland topography. The park is one of the richest dinosaur fossil locales in the world. Forty dinosaur species have been discovered at the park and more than 500 specimens have been removed and exhibited in museums across the globe. The fossil assemblage of nearly 500 species, from microscopic fern spores to large carnivorous dinosaurs, justified it becoming a World Heritage Site in 1979.
The Visitor Centre has exhibits about dinosaurs, fossils, and the geology and natural history of the park. There is a video theater, fossil prep lab area, and a gift shop. Public programs are offered in the summer.
John Ware's Cabin is a restored early 20th century cabin that was used by John Ware, an African-American cowboy and important figure in Alberta's ranching history. The cabin is near the visitor center and is open on select days in the summer.
The Park was set up on June 27, 1955 as part of Alberta's 50th Jubilee Year. The main aim was to protect the fossil beds. The park was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on October 26, 1979. Its significant badlands and riverside habitats, and the importance of the fossils found here, were listed as reasons.
Until 1985, discoveries made in the park had to be shipped to museums throughout the world for scientific analysis and display, including the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. This changed with the opening of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology 100 kilometers upstream in Midland Provincial Park. This has a mission to "collect, preserve, research and interpret palaeontological history with special reference to Alberta’s fossil heritage".
The Park protects a very complex ecosystem with three communities: prairie grasslands, badlands, and riverside cottonwoods. Its ecosystem is surrounded by prairies. Choruses of coyotes are common at dusk, as are the calls of nighthawks. Cottontail rabbits, mule deer, and pronghorn can all be seen in the park; the prairie rattlesnake, bull snake and the red-sided garter snake are present as well. Curlews and Canada geese are among the 165 bird species that can be seen in the spring and summer. Some of the most northern species of cactus, including "Opuntia" (prickly pear) and "Pediocactus" (pincushion) can be seen in full bloom during the later half of June.
The sediments of Dinosaur Provincial Park span 2.8 million years and three formations. The terrestrial Oldman Formation is at the base of the strata; the terrestrial Dinosaur Park Formation above, and the marine Bearpaw at the top. The Dinosaur Park Formation, which contains most of the fossils with articulated skeletons, was mostly laid down by large rivers in very warm temperate coastal lowlands. It was on the western margin of the Western Interior Seaway. The formation dates to about 75 million years ago. The Dinosaur Park Formation lasted about a million years.
Dinosaur Provincial Park preserves an extraordinarily diverse group of freshwater vertebrates. Fish include sharks, rays, paddlefish, bowfins, gars, and teleosts. Amphibians include frogs, salamanders, and extinct albanerpetontids. Reptiles include lizards (such as the large monitor "Paleosaniwa"), a wide range of turtles, crocodilians, and the fish-eating "Champsosaurus". Mammals such as shrews, marsupials, and squirrel-like rodents are also there, although usually only noticed by their fossilized teeth, rather than bones.
Mega-plant fossils are rare in the park, but pollen grains and spores collected from here suggest that these forests contained sycamore, magnolia and bald cypress trees, and "Metasequoia".
The dinosaurs of the park are astonishingly diverse. They include:
Ceratopsia
Hadrosauridae
Ankylosauria
Hypsilophodontidae
Pachycephalosauria
Tyrannosauridae
Ornithomimidae
Caenagnathidae
Dromaeosauridae
Troodontidae
Classification Uncertain
Birds of the "Hesperornis" type were present, as well as giant Pterosauria related to "Quetzalcoatlus". multituberculates, Stagodont marsupials and placental mammals scurried underfoot.

Mule (footwear)

Mule shoes are shoes that are backless and almost always closed-toed. They can be any heel height (flat to high). The shoes are almost always worn by females. High heeled mule shoes were a popular indoor shoe in the 18th century. By the early twentieth century, the shoes were very often associated with prostitutes. However, in the early 1950s, Marilyn Monroe popularized the shoes and helped to break their poor reputations. Similar shoes, called slides, were introduced in the early 1990s, except that slides are open-toed versions of mules.

Ring of Honor (ROH) is a professional wrestling company founded in 2002 by Rob Feinstein and Gabe Sapolsky. The president of the company is Cary Silkin. Their headquarters are in Bristol, Pennsylvania. Matches for the company airs on The Fight Network in Canada and on Samurai TV in Japan. The company also aired matches in the United Kingdom and Ireland. 
The company was started by RF Video owner, Rob Feinstein after Extreme Championship Wrestling went out of business. Feinstein left the company in 2004 after he was caught in an internet sting operation allegedly trying to ask for sex on the internet from a person who he thought was an 13 year old boy but was actually an adult, pretending to be the boy. Gabe Sapolsky left the company on October 26, 2008. Doug Gentry bought Feinstein's stake in the company and sold it to Cary Silkin who then became the president of the company. 
Ring of Honor followed a set of rules called the "code of honor". The code of honor was considered a moral requirement to follow. They were put in place to make Ring of Honor feel more like Japanese professional wrestling. There were originally 5 rules set in place but they were retired in 2004. They reappeared again and were changed to only 3 rules.

Human genome

The human genome is stored on 23 chromosome pairs in the cell nucleus and in the small mitochondrial DNA. A great deal is now known about the sequences of DNA which are on our chromosomes. What the DNA actually does is now partly known. Applying this knowledge in practice has only just begun.
The Human Genome Project (HGP) produced a reference sequence which is used worldwide in biology and medicine. "Nature" published the publicly funded project's report, and "Science" published Celera's paper. These papers described how the draft sequence was produced, and gave an analysis of the sequence. Improved drafts were announced in 2003 and 2005, filling in to ≈92% of the sequence.
The latest project ENCODE studies the way the genes are controlled.
The human genome contains just over 20,000 protein-coding genes, far fewer than had been expected. In fact, only about 1.5% of the genome codes for proteins, while the rest consists of non-coding RNA genes, regulatory sequences, and introns. 
However, a single gene can produce a variety of proteins by means of RNA splicing. One particular Drosophila gene (DSCAM) can be alternatively spliced into 38,000 different mRNAs. Each mRNA codes for a different peptide chain. Therefore the number of proteins produced is far above the number of coding genes.
With RNA splicing and post-RNA translation changes, the total number of unique human proteins may be in the low millions.
The idea that most DNA is useless 'junk' is wrong. At least 80% of the genome has definite functions.

Sucralose is an artificial sweetener, most of which, if ingested, will not be broken down by the body and is thereby non-caloric. Sucralose is almost 600 times as sweet as sucrose, twice as sweet as saccharin and 3 times as sweet as aspartame. It is stable under heat and over a broad range of pH condition, meaning it can be used in baking or products which require longer shelf lives. It was first discovered and patented in 1976.

Farnsworth was known for his role as Sheriff Buster in the 1990 movie "Misery". Farnsworth is the oldest person to receive an Academy Award nominated for Best Actor in a Leading role. He was 79 years old when he was nominated.
He was born in Los Angeles, California on September 1, 1920. He was married to Margaret Hill from 1947 until her death in 1985. They had one child. 
Farnsworth never liked using four-lettered words. He was once asked by Roger Ebert what he was most proud of in regards to his acting career, he replied that it was the fact that in over 60 movies he never says one cuss word. 
Farnsworth committed suicide on October 6, 2000 at his ranch in Lincoln, New Mexico by shooting himself. He was 80 years old.
He was added into the Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 1997.

Black January

Black January (), also known as Black Saturday or the January Massacre, was a massacre by the Soviet Red Army and the KGB secret police agency of peaceful Azerbaijani protesters of the Azerbaijani independence movement. It happened in Baku, Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic on 19–20 January 1990, during the last years of the Soviet Union. Between 133-137 people were killed, when the Red Army and the KGB shot the protesters. As a result, the Azerbaijanis became totally opposed to stay a part of the Soviet Union and started to plan the independence of Azerbaijan. This happened with the end of the Soviet Union in December 1991.
It was one of the rare events during the liberal reform era of "glasnost" (reform of the government) and "perestroika" (reform of the economy) in which the Soviet Union used force against peaceful protesters. Before this era, the Soviet Union did not allow any protests of its population and stopped them violently if they did protest. 
The reason for using violence, was that powerful conservative people in the Communist Party, the Red Army and the KGB did not like these reforms and feared that the ethnic groups and republics of the Soviet Union were getting out of their control with the rise of nationalism. 
However, the use of violence angered the people in Azerbaijan and the rest of the Soviet Union. It had the opposite effect, because the liberal Soviet leaders and their reforms were too popular and powerful in the end. Neither the use of force against protesters nor the reforms prevented the republics becoming independent.

Mary Harris Jones

Mary Harris Jones (1837-November 30, 1930) was an American schoolteacher and tailor. In 1867 her husband and their four children died of yellow fever during an epidemic. There was a fire in Chicago, in 1871. Harris Jones' workshop was destroyed in that fire; she lost everything she had. She turned towards the Knights of Labor. The Knights of Labour was an association of workers who also accepted black people and women. From this point on, Harris Jones became active in the labour movement, fighting for better working conditions and better pay of the workers. In 1905, she was a founding member of Industrial Workers of the World, a trade union. 
She was an amazing speaker because she was able to use stories as examples in her speeches, and she could also make the audience participate. In 1897, she got the title "Mother Jones". She was 60 at the time. In 1903, she was upset about the bad working conditions of children. For this reason, she organised a march where children marched from Philadelphia to the home of President Roosevelt in New York.

Great hammerhead shark

The Great Hammerhead Shark ("Sphyrna mokarran"), is the largest species of the Hammerhead shark group. It can be identified by the shape of its "hammer" (called the "cephalofoil"), which is wide and has an almost straight margin at the front, and by its first dorsal fin which is tall, and is sickle-shaped.
Like all other Hammerhead sharks, the Great Hammerhead Shark has a streamlined body and a "hammer" on its head. They have usually been confused with the Scalloped Hammerhead Shark and the Smooth Hammerhead Shark, but adult Great Hammerhead Sharks can be identified by their wide cephalofoil which has an almost straight margin at the front, and by their first dorsal fin, which is tall and sickle-shaped. The cephalofoil is usually around 1 to 1.5 meters long.
Great Hammerhead Sharks are around 2.85 to 5.5 meters long, and weigh around 450 kg, but the longest ever found was 6.1 meters long. The heaviest ever found was a 4.4 meter long female, which weighed 580 kg, and was caught off Boca Grande, Florida. But the female weighed this much because it was pregnant. The top part of the Great Hammerhead Shark is grey-brown or green, and the belly is white.
The Great Hammerhead Shark is found in tropical waters around the world, between the latitudes 40°N to 37°S. In the Atlantic Ocean it is found from North Carolina to Uruduay, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, and from Morocco to Senegal, and the Mediterranean Sea. It is found all along the rim of the Indian Ocean, and in the Pacific Ocean from the Ryukyu Islands to Australia, New Caledonia, and French Polynesia, and from southern Baja California to Peru. It's said to be found off Gambia, Guinea, Mauritania, Sierra Leone, and Western Sahara, but this has not been confirmed. Great Hammerhead Sharks can be found from inshore waters which are less than 1 meters deep, to a depth of 80 meters offshore. They live mainly in coral reefs, but have been found in lagoons and deep water near land.
Even though Great Hammerhead Sharks are apex predators, young pups have been seen eaten by Bull sharks. Yellow jacks have been seen rubbing themselves against Great Hammerhead Sharks, probably to get rid of parasites. Pilot fish have been seen swimming with Great Hammerhead Sharks.
Great Hammerhead Sharks are viviparous, meaning they give live birth. Females are pregnant for around 11 months, before giving birth to a litter of 6-56 pups. When they are born, the pups are around 50–70 cm (20 to 28 in) long. Males mature when they are about 2.3 to 2.8 meters long, and weigh around 51 kg. Females mature when they are about 2.5 to 3 meters long, and weigh around 41 kg. Great Hammerhead Sharks live for around 20–30 years, but the oldest Great Hammerhead Shark ever found was said to be 40–50 years old.
Great Hammerhead Sharks are known to hunt at dawn and at dusk. They feed on crustaceans like crabs and lobsters, molluscs like squids and octopuses, bony fish like tarpon, sardines, herrings, sea catfish, toadfish, porgies, jacks, croakers, groupers, flatfish, boxfish, and porcupine fish. They also eat other sharks like smoothhounds and grey reef sharks. Great Hammerhead Sharks have been known to eat others of their kind.
Great Hammerhead Sharks' favourite prey are rays and skates; its favourite type of ray are stingrays. The venomous spines of the stingrays don't seem to affect them, because a Great Hammerhead Shark caught off Florida had 96 venomous spines found in and around its mouth.
The cephalofoil of the Great Hammerhead Shark is said to be used to pin stingrays down, because one Great Hammerhead Shark was found attacking a southern stingray in the Bahamas; the Great Hammerhead Shark first pinned the stingray down by hitting the stingray with its cephalofoil, and then it grabbed the stingray in its jaws and started to rip apart the stingray by shaking its head rapidly. Another Great Hammerhead Shark was found attacking a spotted eagle ray in open water; the Great Hammerhead Shark first bit off one of the ray's pectoral fins, and then pinned the ray down with its cephalofoil, and then ate the ray head-first.
Although they have been said to be dangerous towards humans, Great Hammerhead Sharks rarely ever attack humans. Divers have reported that Great Hammerhead Sharks are shy and avoid humans, but there have been reports of Great Hammerhead Sharks approaching divers closely and even chasing them. In 2009, the International Shark Attack File listed 34 attacks caused by a shark which belonged in the "Sphyrna" genus, but it is not confirmed if the shark was a Great Hammerhead Shark or not. The Great Hammerhead Shark has been confirmed to be responsible for one provoked attack.
The Great Hammerhead Shark has been listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), because of fishing for its fins, which are made into shark fin soup, for its skin which is made into leather, and their liver oil for vitamins. Populations of the Great Hammerhead Shark have decreased by 50% because of fishing.

Sapeornis is a genus of primitive bird which lived during the Lower Cretaceous about 125120 million years ago (mya). Only one species is known: "Sapeornis chaoyangensis". The fossils are from the Jiufotang Formation and Yixian Formation rocks in the People's Republic of China. Several nearly complete skeletons have been found.
"Sapeornis" is named after SAPE, the "Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution", added to the Ancient Greek "όρνις" (ornis), meaning "bird". "chaoyangensis" is Latin for "from Chaoyang".
This animal was about 30–33 cm long. The skull has a handful of teeth in the upper jawtip only. A single tail feather has been found on one of the specimens. It may have been a glider or soarer rather than an active flier.

True owl

True owls (or 'Typical owls') are owls of the family Strigidae. 
They are one of the two families of owls, with 189 living species in 25 genera. The other family is the barn owls. True owls are found on every continent except Antarctica.
The division of owls into these two groups is quite ancient. The relationships of the owls in general are still unresolved.
Typical owls vary greatly in size. The smallest is the Elf owl. Its weight is a hundred times less than the largest, the Eurasian Eagle owl and Blakiston's Fish owl. Most owls have very similar bodies. They have large heads, short tails, and round facial circles around the eyes. Most live in trees (with a few exceptions like the Burrowing owl) and get their food on the wing. The wings are large, broad, rounded and long. Like other birds of prey many owls have females that are larger than males.
They are nocturnal. Because of this the plumage is not much different between males and females. The feathers are soft and the base of each is downy. This give them silent flight. Hearing in owls is highly sensitive. The ears are asymmetrical which lets the owl localise a sound. Owls have massive eyes relative to their body size.

Tytonidae

Barn-owls (family Tytonidae) are one of the two families of owls. The other is the true owls, Strigidae. They are medium to large sized owls with large heads and heart-shaped faces. They have long, strong legs with powerful talons. 
The barn owls are a wide ranging family. They are not found in northern North America, Saharan Africa and large areas of Asia. They live in a wide range of habitats from deserts to forests, and from temperate latitudes to the tropics.
The barn-owls' main characteristic is the heart-shaped facial disc, formed by stiff feathers. The feathers help to amplify and locate the source of sounds when the bird hunts. Adaptations to the wing feathers eliminate sound caused by flying. This helps both the owl's hearing, and keeps the prey unaware of the owl. To summarise: the owl hunts mainly at dusk and night-time. Its uses sound to detect prey movement: its hearing is sensitive, and its wings are almost silent.

Mount Parnassus, also Parnassos, is a mountain of limestone in central Greece. It is north of the Gulf of Corinth. According to Greek mythology, this mountain was sacred to Apollo and the home of the Muses. 
Mount Parnassus is named after Parnassos, the son of the nymph Kleodora and the man Kleopompus. Parnassos was leader of a city that was flooded by rains. The people ran from the flood up the mountain slope. There the survivors built another city and called it Lykoreia. According to some traditions, Parnassus was the site of the fountain Castalia and the home of the Muses. As the home of the Muses, Parnassus became known as the home of poetry, music, and learning.
Parnassus was also the site of several unrelated minor events in Greek mythology.
Parnassus was also the home of Pegasus, the winged horse of Bellerophon.
Today, the slopes of Mount Parnassus have two ski centres. The Parnassos Ski Centre has two sections, Kellaria and Fterolakka, which together make up the largest ski centre in Greece. A smaller ski centre (only two drag lifts) called Gerontovrahos is across a ridge from Kellaria. 
Parnassus is mined for its large supply of bauxite. The bauxite is converted to aluminium oxide and then to aluminium.

This group only lives in sub-Saharan Africa. They had a wider range in prehistoric times and apparently evolved in Europe.
They are slender greyish or brown birds with soft, hairlike body feathers. They are typically about 10 cm in body length. They have a long, thin, tail a further 20–24 cm in length. They weigh 45–55 grams. They are arboreal and scurry through the leaves like rodents, in search of berries, fruit and buds. This habit, and their legs, is the reason for the group's English name. They can feed upside down. They have crests and stubby bills.
Mousebirds are very talkative. They are found in bands of about twenty in lightly wooded country.
These birds build cup-shaped twig nests in trees, which are lined with grasses. 2–4 eggs are typically laid.

Warrior (born James Brian Hellwig; June 16, 1959 – April 8, 2014)) was an American professional wrestler. Hellshaw legally changed his name to Warrior in 2002. He was the biggest star of the 1990s. His career had a boost when he defeated Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania VI, and it was also Hulk Hogan's first Wrestlemania loss, firstly before defeated by The Rock at WrestleMania X8.
Warrior died of a heart attack on the afternoon of April 8, 2014 at 54 years old, 3 days after being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame and less than a day after cutting a promo on "Raw".
Less than 24 hours before he died, Warrior gave a speech to the fans and wrestlers, past and present, in his Ultimate Warrior character. During the speech he said:
"No WWE talent becomes a legend on their own. Every man's heart one day beats its final beat. His lungs breathe their final breath. And if what that man did in his life makes the blood pulse through the body of others and makes them believe deeper in something larger than life then his essence, his spirit, will be immortalized. By the story tellers, by the loyalty, by the memory of those who honor him and make the running the man did live forever. You, you, you, you, you, you are the legend makers of Ultimate Warrior. In the back I see many potential legends. Some of them with warrior spirits. And you will do the same for them. You will decide if they lived with the passion and intensity. So much so that you will tell your stories and you will make them legends, as well. I am Ultimate Warrior. You are the Ultimate Warrior fans. And the spirit of the Ultimate Warrior will run forever!"
Warrior was born as James Brian Hellwig (though changed name to Hellshaw in 1969). He was the eldest of five children and was raised by his mother (along with, later, his stepfather) after his father left his family when young James was 12. He spent a year at Indiana State University. It was also during this time he began to compete in amateur bodybuilding.
Hellshaw debuted as the Dingo Warrior in 1985.

Aristarchus of Samos

Aristarchus (310 BC – about 230 BC), was an ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician. His is the first known model that put the Sun at the center of the known universe with the Earth revolving around it (see Solar system).
Aristarchus was influenced by Philolaus of Croton, but he identified the "central fire" with the Sun, and put the other planets in their correct order of distance around the Sun. His astronomical ideas were often rejected in favour of the geocentric theories of Aristotle and Ptolemy.
His name is "Ἀρίσταρχος" in Greek letters, which transliterates to Aristarchos. He was born on the island of Samos, in the eastern Aegean Sea.
Heliocentrism is the idea of the Sun at the centre. Though the original text has been lost, a reference in Archimedes' book "The Sand Reckoner" describes another work by Aristarchus in which he advanced the heliocentric model as an alternative hypothesis. Archimedes wrote:
So Aristarchus believed the stars were very far away, which is an important step. Therefore, there was no observable parallax, that is, a movement of the stars relative to each other while the Earth moves around the Sun. The stars are much farther away than was generally assumed in ancient times; and the tiny amount of stellar parallax is only detectable with telescopes.
The old geocentric model explained planetary parallax, and was assumed to be the reason why no stellar parallax was observed. Rejection of the heliocentric view was common, as the following passage from Plutarch suggests ("On the apparent face in the orb of the Moon"):
The only other astronomer of antiquity who is known by name and who is known to have supported Aristarchus' heliocentric model was Seleucus, a Hellenistic astronomer who lived a century after Aristarchus.
The heliocentric theory was successfully revived nearly 1800 years later by Copernicus, after which Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton gave the theoretical explanation based on laws of physics, namely Kepler's laws for the motion of planets and Newton's laws on gravitational attraction and dynamics.
The Vatican library has preserved two ancient manuscripts with estimates of the length of the year. The only ancient scientist listed for two different values is Aristarchus. Both are close to the values later used by Hipparchus and Ptolemy, and the precession indicated is almost precisely 1 degree per century, a value which is too low. 1 degree per century precession was used by all later astronomers until the Arabs. The correct value in Aristarchus's time was about 1.38 degrees per century.

Saigon River

The Saigon River () is a river in Vietnam. It begins at Lake Dau Tieng (in its water-catchment area) near the country of Cambodia.
The river flows south and south-southeast for about . Most of the rivers in the Mekong Delta region have a water-table and canal connection. The system of rivers and canals for southern Vietnam help with water transport for commercial activities. The water supplies many businesses and agricultural (farm) operations.
The Saigon River has a river port at Ho Chi Minh City. It ends just after the Phu My Bridge (). The Saigon River ends by meeting another two rivers, the Nha Be and Dong Nai rivers. The lower end of the river is on the flood plain, and is therefore subject to tide change from the sea and delta. Ho Chi Minh City regularly floods (in areas that get a lot of floods) with either tidewater or rainwater.
The river system has many fish. Recently the government released native fish to improve the population. Fish, shrimp, and snails are popular for farming.

Avemetatarsalia

Avemetatarsalia (meaning "bird toes") is a clade name established in 1999 for all crown group archosaurs that are closer to birds than to crocodiles. An alternate name is Panaves, or "all birds", meaning all animals, living or extinct, which are more closely related to birds than to crocodiles.
Members of this group are basically the dinosaurs (including birds), the pterosaurs, and some earlier animals which are a bit difficult to place. They are one wing of the Archosaurs, the other being the Crurotarsi.
Bird-line archosaurs appear in the fossil record early in the Middle Triassic about 245 million years ago (mya), with the dinosaur-like "Asilisaurus". However, Lower Triassic fossil footprints reported in 2010 from Poland may belong to a still more primitive type. If so, the origin of avemetatarsalians would be pushed back to around 249 mya. The oldest Polish footprints were made by an unknown small quadrupedal animal, but slightly later footprints show that moderately large bipedal dinosauromorphs had appeared by 246 mya.
The Permian-Triassic extinction event is dated at about 250 mya. The TriassicJurassic junction is about 200 mya. The age of the footprints suggests that the rise of the dinosaurs was slow and drawn out across much of the Triassic.

Sphyrna

Sphyrna is one of the two genera in the Hammerhead shark group, and is the largest genera out of the two, with eight members in it. The word "Sphyrna" is a Greek word meaning "hammer", which refers to the shape of the shark's head.
Members in the "Sphyrna" group measure in size from the Scoophead, which is 100 centimeters (1 meter) long, to the Great hammerhead shark, which is 610 centimeters (6.1 meters) long. The Smalleye Hammerhead Shark weighs around 9 kg, and the Great hammerhead shark weighs about 230 kg. Members of this group are usually light grey or brownish grey in colour with a tint of green, and have a white belly.
Members of the "Sphyrna" group's favourite type of food are stingrays. But they also eat crustaceans like blue crabs and shrimp, molluscs like octopuses and squids, many types of fish like sardines and herrings, and other types of sharks. When they can not find food they start eating each other, but the Great hammerhead shark is known to eat its own young.
Members of this group are mainly viviparous, but in 2007, a bonnethead was found to be capable of asexual reproduction. They give birth to around 12-40 young at a time. Once they are born, young ones come together in groups, and swim towards warmer waters. They then stay together in groups until they are older and big enough to live on their own. They live for around 20–30 years.

The Quad Cities is a group of five cities along the Mississippi River in the states of Iowa and Illinois. The five cities are Davenport, Iowa, Bettendorf, Iowa, Moline, Illinois, East Moline, Illinois, and Rock Island, Illinois. The largest of these cities is Davenport. Nearly 400,000 people live in the area.
The name "Quad Cities" can be confusing because "quad" means four. People began calling the area the Quad Cities in the 1960s, before Bettendorf was large enough to be considered a "city". By the time Bettendorf was large enough, people were so used to the name "Quad Cities" that they decided to keep it. (Even earlier, the area had been called the "Tri-Cities", before East Moline became large enough to be considered a city.)
The manufacturing, or making, of goods is a big part of the economy in the Quad Cities. Military equipment, such as weapons and armor, are made at the Rock Island Arsenal. John Deere & Company, which makes farm equipment, is in Moline.

Northeast Greenland National Park

Northeast Greenland National Park is a national park in Greenland, Denmark. It is the largest national park in the world, with an area of . This makes the park larger than most countries. It would place 31st if it were a country, just behind Egypt. It is the only national park in Greenland, and the most northerly national park in the world. Its most northerly point reaches slightly further than the most northerly point in Quttinirpaaq National Park in Canada. 
The park was first created on 22 May 1974. It came from the northern, practically uninhabited part of the former Ittoqqortoormiit Municipality in Tunu (East Greenland). In 1988 the park was expanded by another to its present size. This was by adding the northeastern part of the former county of Avannaa (North Greenland). In January 1977 it was made an international biosphere reserve. 
An estimated 5,000 to 15,000 musk oxen, as well as many polar bears and walrus, can be found near the coastal regions of the park. This is claimed to be 40% of the world population of musk ox. Other mammals include arctic fox, stoat, collared lemming and arctic hare. Other marine mammals include ringed seal, bearded seal, harp seal and hooded seal as well as narwhal and Beluga whale.
Species of birds which breed in the park include great northern diver, barnacle goose, pink-footed goose, common eider, king eider, gyrfalcon, snowy owl, sanderling, ptarmigan and raven.

Bearded seal

The bearded seal ("Erignathus barbatus"), also called the square flipper seal, is a medium-sized pinniped. It is found in and near to the Arctic Ocean. 
Fossils indicate that, during the Pleistocene epoch, bearded seals went as far south as South Carolina.
Features of this earless seal include square front flippers and thick bristles on its muzzle. Adults are greyish-brown in colour, darker on the back. Occasionally the face and neck are reddish-brown. Bearded seal pups are born with a greyish-brown fur with scattered patches of white on the back and head. The bearded seal is unique in the subfamily Phocinae in having two pairs of teats. This is a feature it shares with monk seals. 
Bearded seals are about to in nose-to-tail length. They are to in weight. Both sexes are about the same size. 
Bearded seals are a main food source for polar bears and for the Inuit of the Arctic coast. The body fat content of a bearded seal is 30–40%.
Bearded seals feed on a variety of small prey found along the ocean floor, including clams, squid, and fish. Their whiskers serve as feelers in the soft bottom sediments. Adults tend not to dive very deep. They like shallow coastal areas no more than deep. Pups up to one year old will venture much deeper, diving as deep as .
Bearded seals give birth in the spring. In the Canadian Arctic, seal pupping is in May. Further south, in Alaska, most pups are born in late April. Pups are born on small drifting ice floes in shallow waters. They usual weigh around 30–40 kg. They enter the water only hours after they are born, and quickly become very good divers. Mothers care for the pups for 18–24 days. During this time the pups grow at an average rate of 3.3 kg per day. Pups consume an average of eight liters of milk a day. By the time they are weaned, the pups have grown to about one hundred kilograms.
Just before the pups are weaned, a new mating cycle takes place. Females ovulate at the end of their lactation period, but stay close to their pups, ready to defend them if necessary. During the mating season, male seals will "sing". This sound may attract females, or may be used by the males to say what territory is theirs or their readiness for breeding. Males live in the same areas from one year to the next.

Hooded seal

The hooded seal ("Cystophora cristata") is an arctic pinniped. It is found only in the central and western North Atlantic. It ranges from Svalbard in the east to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the west.
The male has a peculiar inflatable bladder on the head. This bladder hangs between his eyes and down over his upper lip in the deflated state. In addition, he can inflate a large balloon-like sac from one of his nostrils. The bulge develops when the seal is four years old. The male can blow up this bulge, so that it is the size of its head.
The hooded seal can live to about age 30 to 35.
Adult males are long on average, and weigh . Females are much smaller: long and weighing . The colour is silvery; the body is scattered with dark, irregular marks. The head is darker than the rest of the body, and without marks.
Pups are about long at birth and weigh about . They are born on the ice from mid-March to early April. They are born with a slate blue-grey coat with a pale cream color on the belly. They moult after about 14 months. Nursing of the pup lasts for an average of only 4 days. This is the shortest lactation period of any mammal. During the 4 days the pup doubles in size, gaining around 7 kg/day. This is possible because the milk that they drink has a fat content of 60%. The female pup will mature between ages 3 and 6. The male pup will mature between ages 5 and 7.

Barnacle goose

The Barnacle Goose ("Branta leucopsis") belongs to the genus "Branta" of black geese. This genus has species with largely black plumage, setting them apart from the grey "Anser" species. 
The Barnacle Goose is a medium-sized goose, long. Its wingspan is and the body mass is . It has a white face and black head, neck, and upper breast. Its belly is white. The wings and its back are silver-gray with black-and-white bars that look like they are shining when the light reflects on it. During flight a V-shaped white rump patch and the silver-gray underwing linings can be seen.
Barnacle Geese often build their nests high on mountain cliffs. This keeps them away from predators (mostly Arctic Foxes and Polar Bears) but also away from food. Like all geese, the goslings are not fed by the adults. Instead of bringing food to the newly hatched goslings, the goslings are brought to the ground. Unable to fly, the three day old goslings jump off the cliff and fall. Their small size, feathery down, and very light weight helps to protect some of them from serious injury when they hit the rocks below. Many do die from the fall. Arctic foxes are attracted by the noise made by the parent geese during this time. They eat many dead or injured goslings. The foxes also stalk the young as they are led by the parents to wetland feeding areas.

Pink-footed Goose

The Pink-footed Goose (Anser brachyrhynchus) is a goose which breeds in eastern Greenland, Iceland and Svalbard. It is migratory. It winters in northwest Europe, especially Great Britain, the Netherlands, and western Denmark. 
It is a medium-sized goose, 60–75 cm (24–30 in) long. The wingspan is 135–170  (53–67 in) cm. It weighs 1.8–3.4 kg (4–7.5 lbs). It has a short bill, bright pink in the middle with a black base and tip, and pink feet. The body is grey-brown, the head and neck a richer, darker brown, the rump white, and the tail grey with a broad white tip. 
Nesting is often on cliffs close to glaciers. This gives protection from mammalian predators (mainly Arctic Fox). Three to six eggs are laid in early to mid May in Iceland, late May in Svalbard. Incubation lasts 26–27 days. On hatching, the goslings go with the parents on foot to the nearest lake. They fledge after about 56 days. Southbound migration is from mid September to early October, and northbound from mid April to early May.
The diet is almost entirely vegetarian. In summer, they feed on a wide range of tundra plants, both on land and in water. In winter, they graze mostly on oilseed rape, sugar beet, potato, and various grasses. Damage to crops can be large.

Common Eider

The Common Eider ("Somateria mollissima") is a large sea-duck. They live on the northern coasts of Europe, North America and eastern Siberia. It breeds in Arctic and some northern temperate regions. They winter farther south in temperate zones. There it can form large flocks on coastal waters. It can fly at speeds up to 113 km/h (70 mph). 
The Common Eider is both the largest of the four eider species and the largest duck found in Europe and in North America. It measures in length, weighs and spans across the wings. It has a bulky shape and large, wedge-shaped bill. The male is unmistakable, with its black and white plumage and green nape. The female is a brown bird. It can be told apart from all ducks, except other eider species, because of size and head shape. This duck's call is a pleasant "ah-ooo". The species is often readily approachable.
This species dives for crustaceans and molluscs, with mussels being a favoured food. The eider will eat mussels by swallowing them whole; the shells are then crushed in their gizzard and excreted. When eating a crab, the Eider will remove all of its claws and legs, and then eat the body in a similar fashion.
Eiders are colonial breeders. They nest on coastal islands in colonies ranging in size of less than 100 to upwards of 10,000-15,000 individuals. Female eiders often return to breed on the same island where they were hatched. This can lead to a high degree of relatedness between individuals nesting on the same island.

King Eider

The King Eider ("Somateria spectabilis") is a large sea duck. It breeds along Northern Hemisphere Arctic coasts of northeast Europe, North America and Asia. The birds spend most of the year in coastal marine ecosystems at high latitudes. They migrate to the Arctic tundra to breed in June and July. They lay four to seven eggs in a scrape on the ground lined with grass and down.
The King Eider winters in arctic and subarctic marine areas, most notably in the Bering Sea, the west coast of Greenland, eastern Canada and northern Norway. It also happens yearly off the northeastern United States, Scotland and Kamchatka. Breeding areas include the Arctic coastal tundra of the north coast of Alaska. This species dives for benthic invertebrates, such as crustaceans, polychaete worms, and molluscs, with mussels being a favoured food. Wintering birds can form large flocks on suitable coastal waters, with some flocks bigger than 100,000 birds.
This species is smaller than the Common Eider. The male is unmistakable with its black body, white breast and multicoloured head. The drake's call is a deep cooing. 
The female is a brown bird. They can still be told apart from all ducks except other eider species on size and structure. The head is shorter than in the Common Eider, and the feathering onto the bill is rounded, not triangular in shape.
An immature drake is typically all dark with a white breast and a yellow bill patch. 
The King Eider is a regular source of fresh meat in the spring. They begin their migration past the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in late April and are hunted in great numbers. In May, several hundred thousand King Eiders pass Point Barrow in northern Alaska on their way to Alaskan and Canadian breeding grounds.

Ziegler Polar Expedition

The Ziegler polar expedition of 1903–1905 was a failed attempt to reach the North Pole. The party was stranded north of the Arctic Circle for two years before being rescued. All but one of its members survived. The expedition was paid for by William Ziegler and led by Anthony Fiala. They left from Tromsø, Norway, on June 14, 1903, aboard "America". 
Ziegler chose Anthony Fiala, who was a photographer on an earlier mission, to lead his second polar trip. Fiala calculated that the food for an eight dog team and driver would be at least 1100 pounds. This was an issue, as the most a sled could hold was 600 pounds. He planned to use ponies to carry the extra supplies. Then to feed the dogs on horse meat when the supplies were low.
In November 1903 severe weather started. The ship broke up, destroying the provisions and coal. 
The following spring, more tries were made to reach the pole by traveling both east and west. The conditions were too severe, and open water caused difficulties. Supplies ran low, and the expedition headed south. They reached depots at Cape Flora, Cape Dillion, and Camp Ziegler.
William Peters, who was second in command, took this time to lead the crew in survey work. This helped to make maps and charts better.
With the knowledge that rescue ships would be sent to them, the expedition stayed hopeful. A rescue party, led by William S. Champ aboard the "Terra Nova", sailed direct to the ice fields. On July 24, they encountered thick ice. This made the crew doubt they could reach their destination. However the ship reached Palmi Island on July 28 and Cape Dillion the following day. 6 expedition members were found there. More members were found at Cape Flora, and the Terra Nova returned to Cape Dillion. A sled party was organized, which brought back the crew.

Named after amateur Malaysian naturalist, Datuk Chan Chew Lun, only six specimens are known, all from the state of Sabah in Borneo. Very little is known about its biology, but it may live in the canopy of the rainforest, making it especially hard to find. However, there is no evidence, and the related "Phobaeticus kirbyi" is found on low growing vegetation alongside rainforest paths. 
"Phobaeticus chani" was selected as one of "The Top 10 New Species" described in 2008 by the International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University and an international committee of taxonomists. The species was also listed as one of the top ten discoveries of the decade in a BBC television documentary (broadcast in either 2010 or 2011).

Photographic memory

A photographic memory, or eidetic memory, is the ability to remember images or objects in great detail after seeing them for only a short time. The existence of this ability is disputed.
The claims made differ somewhat, but stress the recall of visual information. Examples of the information include: pages from books, magazines, and license plate numbers. It is claimed that those with a photographic memory tend to have higher IQs than those without it. A person with this ability does not use mnemonics. 
The ability is said to occur in the early childhood of a small number of children (between 2 percent and 10 percent) and generally is not found in adults. 
Some do not believe this skill exists. The American cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky, in his book "The Society of Mind" (1988), thought that reports of photographic memory were an “unfounded myth”.
Adriaan de Groot studied the ability of chess grandmasters to memorize the positions of chess pieces on a chess board. At first, people thought they had photographic memory because they could memorize far more information than nonexperts. However, arrangements of pieces that could never occur in a game, their recall was no better than nonexperts. This suggests that they only have an ability to remember certain types of information, rather than photographic memory.
Around 1970, Charles Stromeyer studied his future wife, Elizabeth. He claimed that she could recall poetry written in a foreign language which she did not understand. She could remember the poetry years after she had first seen the poem. She also could, apparently, recall random dot patterns so as to combine two patterns into a stereoscopic image. She is the only person who is known to have passed such a test. The methods used in the testing procedures were not clear. Additionally, the tests have never been repeated (Elizabeth has consistently refused to repeat them). This raised further concerns, and increased skepticism about whether photographic memories were real.

Many-plumed moth

The many-plumed moths are the Alucitidae, a family of moths with unusually modified wings. Both fore- and hind-wings consist of about six rigid spines, from which radiate flexible bristles. They make a structure similar to a bird's feather.
This is a small family, with 9 genera and 130 species. They are found mostly in temperate to subtropical (but not tropical) regions. They are rare even in parts of their core range; both in Great Britain and North America for example, only one species is found – the Twenty-plume Moth ("Alucita hexadactyla") – and in America, it is introduced. This smallish moth may be found fluttering in the evening twilight or resting with its "wings" outstretched. Its larvae feed on honeysuckle ("Lonicera"). 
On the other hand, in Continental Europe there are many species, mostly of the large genus "Alucita".

The Scarlet Tiger Moth ("Callimorpha dominula", formerly "Panaxia dominula") is a colourful dayflying moth of Europe and the near East. It belongs to the tiger moth family, Arctiidae.
The caterpillars feed mostly on comfrey ("Symphytum officinale"). The moth imago flies by day, and has both cryptic colouring on the front wings, and warning colour on the hind wings. If disturbed it jinks the front wings forward to show the red warning flash on the hind wings.
It can occur in rare colour morphs, one with yellow hindwings and body and one with extended black on hindwings. Yellow, black and red are common warning colours in insects and other animals.
The three morphs occurring in the population at the Cothill reserve in Oxfordshire have been studied for many years, including research by E.B. Ford and R.A. Fisher.
McNamara (1998) describes how amateurs can rear this species.

On September 11, 2012, the U.S. embassies in Cairo, Egypt; Chennai, India; Tunis, Tunisia; Khartoum, Sudan; Sana'a, Yemen, and the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya were attacked.
On September 11, 2012, the attack was caused by protests over media excerpts from a trailer of a movie, "Innocence of Muslims", which the protestors considered blasphemy against the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. In Egypt, a group scaled the embassy wall and tore down the American flag, replacing it with a black Islamist flag. In Libya, rocket-propelled grenades were fired at the consulate from a nearby farm. The attack killed the visiting U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, Glen Doherty a security officer, Sean Smith a United States Foreign Service Information Management Officer, and Tyrone S. Woods a former U.S. Navy Seal, ten Libyan police officers, and two others. The protest ended on September 27, 2012.
About 75 people died during the attack. The most notable deaths were the ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods.
Other locations include:
Some of these locations were burning the United States flag and the Israeli flag.

RNA interference

RNA interference (RNAi) is a process in living cells. It adjusts (moderates) the activity of their genes. RNAi molecules are a key to gene regulation. In 2006, Andrew Fire and Craig Mello shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on RNA interference in the nematode worm "Caenorhabditis elegans", published in 1998.
Two types of small RNA molecules – microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) – do the work. These small RNAs bind to normal messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules and increase or decrease their activity. They can prevent a mRNA from producing a protein. RNA interference defends cells against foreign nucleotide sequences – viruses and transposons. Also, they control development, and gene expression in general.
The RNAi pathway is found in many eukaryotes including animals. RNAi is a valuable research tool, in cell culture and in living organisms. Synthetic dsRNA introduced into cells can suppress specific genes of interest. RNAi may be used for large-scale screens that shut down each gene to analyse cellular process or cell division. The pathway is also used as a practical tool in biotechnology and medicine.
The natural functions of RNA interference are:

Jonathan Winters

Jonathan Harshman Winters III (November 11, 1925 – April 11, 2013) was an American comedian, television, stage, voice, movie actor, and artist. Winters had appeared in several television shows and in movies. He was recently known for voicing Papa Smurf in the 2011 movie "The Smurfs". In "", he was replaced by Jack Angel.
Winters was born Jonathan Harshman Winters III in Dayton, Ohio on November 11, 1925. He is of Irish-Scottish-English descent. During his senior year at Springfield High School, Winters quit school to join the United States Marine Corps and served two and a half years in the Pacific Theater during World War II. After his return, he attended Kenyon College. He later studied cartooning at Dayton Art Institute, where he met Eileen Schauder, whom he married on September 11, 1948. He was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Lambda chapter).
Beginning in 1960, Winters recorded many classic comedy albums for the Verve Records label. He also had comedy albums released every decade for over 50 years, receiving 11 Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album nominations during his career, and winning the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Comedy Album for Crank(y) Calls in 1996.
In 1957, he was the first comedian in the United States to be on color television, a 15-minute routine sponsored by Tums.
Winters has also appeared in hundreds of television show episodes/series and movies combined, including eccentric characters on "The Steve Allen Show", "The Garry Moore Show", "The Wacky World of Jonathan Winters" (1972–74), "Mork & Mindy", "Hee Haw" and in "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World".
After voicing Grandpa Smurf on "The Smurfs" (1986–89) and Papa Smurf in "The Smurfs", Winters's final feature movie was "The Smurfs 2" in 2013, which will be dedicated in his memory.
Winters was originally cast in "Big Finish" (2014), during pre-production. It's an upcoming comedy set in a retirement home. His scheduled role was to appear alongside Jerry Lewis and Bob Newhart.
Winters only had three influences Irwin Corey, Groucho Marx, and Charlie Chaplin. He had influenced George Carlin, Billy Crystal, Bill Cosby, Robin Williams, Richard Lewis, Jim Carrey, Conan O'Brien, Patton Oswalt, and Frank Caliendon. He worked with Robin Williams on many television shows including "Mork & Mindy". When Winters died Williams remarked that "First he was my idol, then he was my mentor and amazing friend. I'll miss him huge. He was my Comedy Buddha. Long live the Buddha."
In 1991, Winters earned an Emmy Award for his supporting role in "Davis Rules". In 2002, he earned an Emmy nomination as a guest star in a comedy series for "Life With Bonnie". In 1999, Winters was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. In 2008, Winters was presented with a Pioneer TV Land Award by Robin Williams. Winters received 11 Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album nominations during his career, and won the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Comedy Album for "Crank(y) Calls" in 1996.
Winters lived near Santa Barbara, California and was often seen browsing or "hamming" for the crowd at the antique show on the Ventura County fairgrounds. He often entertained the tellers and other workers whenever he visited his local bank to make a deposit or withdrawal. Plus, he spent his time painting and attended many gallery showings, even presenting his art in one-man shows.
In his interview with the Archive of American Television, Winters reported that he suffered a nervous breakdown and spent 8 months in a private mental hospital in the late 1950s. Despite not being given a diagnosis in the hospital, he was diagnosed with manic depression later on (known today as bipolar disorder). Winters referred to this incident obliquely in his stand-up act, most famously on his 1960 comedy album "The Wonderful World of Jonathan Winters". During his classic "flying saucer" routine, Winters mentions that if he wasn't careful, the authorities might put him back in the "zoo", referring to the institution.
On January 11, 2009, Winter's wife Eileen died at the age of 84 after a 20-year battle with breast cancer.
Winters died April 11, 2013, in Montecito, California of natural causes, aged 87.
He is survived by his two children: Jay Winters, and Lucinda Winters.
At the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards, Robin Williams honored the career and life of Winters.

Gini coefficient

The Gini coefficient (also known as the Gini index or Gini ratio) is a measure of differences in income. It was developed by the Italian statistician Corrado Gini in 1912.
The Gini coefficient is usually a number between 0 and 1 (or 0 to 100). 0 means a country where the income is equally distributed. On the other hand, 1 means that one person owns everything but the rest owns nothing. In reality, all scores are between 0.25 and 0.6 (between 25 and 60 on the 0 to 100 scale).
The table below is about the "world" Gini coefficient (not by single countries).

<doc id="362135" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=362135" title="Lemma (linguistics)">
Lemma (linguistics)

A lemma is word which stands at the head of a definition in a dictionary. All the head words in a dictionary are lemmas. Technically, it is "a base word and its inflections".
A lemma is the word you find in the dictionary. A lexeme is a unit of meaning, and can be more than one word. A lexeme is the set of all forms that have the same meaning, while "lemma" refers to the particular form that is chosen by convention to represent the lexeme.
In English, for example, "run", "runs", "ran" and "running" are forms of the same lexeme, but "run" is the lemma. 
In English, the lemma of a noun is the singular: e.g., "mouse" rather than "mice". In languages with gender, the head word of regular adjectives and nouns is usually the masculine singular. If the language also has cases, the lemma is often the masculine singular nominative.
In many languages, the citation form of a verb is the infinitive: French "aller", German "gehen", Spanish "ir". In English it usually is the full infinitive ("to go") although alphabetized without 'to' ("go"). 
In computational linguistics, a stem is the part of the word that never changes even when different forms of the word are used. A lemma is the base form of the verb. For example, from "produced", the lemma is "produce", but the stem is "produc-". This is because there are words such as production. When sound (phonology) is taken into account, the definition of the unchangeable part of the word is not so useful. Notice the sound of the words in the example: "produced" versus "production" .
Some lexemes have several stems but one lemma. For instance "to go" (the lemma) has the stems "go" and "went". Here, the past tense is based on a different verb, "to wend". The "-t" suffix is equivalent to "-ed".

Honey War

The Honey War was a bloodless border dispute in the 1830s between Iowa (first as a part of Wisconsin Territory, then Iowa Territory) and Missouri over their border.
The Honey War was caused by a disagreement over a wide piece of land covering the entire border (see map). The disagreement was caused because 3 things were not easy to understand: the Missouri Constitution's part about borders, the survey of the Louisiana Purchase, and treaties with the Native Americans. The United States Supreme Court ended the dispute in Iowa's favor. It said that the almost-straight border of Iowa would follow the Des Moines River south for about until it reached the Mississippi River near Keokuk.
During the War, the state militias faced each other, a Missouri sheriff collecting taxes in Iowa was arrested, and three honey trees were cut down.

Magma (mathematics)

In mathematics, a magma is kind of algebraic structure. It is a set with a binary operation on that set.
A binary operation works by taking two elements from a set (that do not have to be different) and returning some other element of that set.
If we give the set a label (such as "X") and the binary operation a label (such as •). Then we give the magma the label ("X", •).
The natural numbers with addition form a magma. Because the set of natural numbers is written as formula_1 and addition is written as formula_2 the magma is written as formula_3. The name of the magma would be "The natural numbers under addition".
The integers with multiplication form a magma. Because the set of integers is written as formula_4 and multiplication (in abstract mathematics) is written as formula_5 the magma is written as formula_6. The name of the magma would be "The integers under multiplication".
The real numbers under division do not form a magma. This is because numbers cannot be divided by 0. A binary operation requires that "any" two elements can be taken from the set (in this case in order) to produce another element from the set. The real numbers without 0 is written as formula_7. It can be shown that the formula_8 is a magma.

Jet (lignite)

Jet is a geological material considered to be a minor gemstone. It is originally a wood product called lignite, squeezed and heated by geological processes. The older definition of mineral did not apply to organic material. Therefore, jet was not called a mineral, but instead a "mineraloid". However, this view is changing, as so many crystalline materials have organic origin.
The English noun "jet" comes from the French word for the same material: "jaiet". Jet is either black or dark brown, but may contain pyrite inclusions, which are of brassy colour and metallic lustre. The adjective "jet-black", meaning as dark a black as possible, comes from this material.

<doc id="362249" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=362249" title="Great Oxygenation Event">
Great Oxygenation Event

The Great Oxygenation Event (GOE) was the introduction of free oxygen into our atmosphere. It was caused by cyanobacteria doing photosynthesis. It took a very long time, from about three billion years ago to about one billion years ago.
Photosynthesis was producing oxygen both before and after the GOE. The difference was that before the GOE, organic matter and dissolved iron chemically captured any free oxygen. Dissolved iron (of which there was a great deal) became iron oxide and huge deposits of this are found as banded iron rock from the Archaean and Proterozoic eras. The GOE was the point when these minerals became saturated and could not capture any more oxygen. The excess free oxygen started to accumulate in the atmosphere.
Oxygen was toxic to most of the Earth's anaerobic inhabitants at the time. As cyanobacteria produced oxygen, and built their stromatolites, they changed the environment for other protists. Since the other protists had no way to deal with oxygen, most would have become extinct. Another consequence was the effect of free oxygen on atmospheric methane, a greenhouse gas. The reaction removed the methane and caused the Huronian glaciation, possibly the longest snowball Earth episode ever. Free oxygen has been an important part of the atmosphere ever since.
The evidence is that free oxygen was first produced by photosynthetic organisms (prokaryotic, then eukaryotic) which emitted oxygen as a waste product. These organisms lived long before the GOE, perhaps 3500 million years ago (mya). The oxygen they produced would have quickly been removed from the atmosphere by the 'mass rusting' which led to the deposition of banded-iron formations. Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities shortly (~50 million years) before the start of the GOE. Without a draw-down, oxygen would accumulate very rapidly. At today's rates of photosynthesis (which are much greater than those in the land-plant-free Precambrian), modern atmospheric O levels could be produced in around 2,000 years.

Toll-like receptor

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are proteins which act in the innate immune system and the digestive system. They are membrane-spanning, that is, they reach from the outside of the cell to the inside. 
TLRs recognize molecules which come from microbes. Once microbes get through physical barriers such as the skin or intestinal tract mucosa, they are recognized by TLRs. The TLRs set up an immune cell response.
TLR signalling leads to the induction or suppression of genes that orchestrate the inflammatory response. In all, thousands of genes are activated by TLR signalling, and the TLRs are one of the most important means of gene modulation.
Toll-like receptors have also been shown to be an important link between innate and adaptive immunity through their presence in dendritic cells.
Most mammalian species have between ten and fifteen types of Toll-like receptors. Thirteen TLRs (TLR1 to TLR13) have been identified in humans and mice, and similar ones have been found in other mammalian species. TLRs are not identical in all mammals. For example, a gene coding for a protein like TLR10 in humans is present in mice, but seems to have been damaged at some time by a retrovirus. On the other hand, mice express TLRs 11, 12, and 13, none of which is present in humans. Other mammals may express TLRs that are not found in humans. Non-mammalian species may have TLRs different from mammals.
They got their name from their similarity to the protein coded by the Toll gene identified in "Drosophila" in 1985 by Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard. The gene in question, when mutated, makes the Drosophila flies look unusual. The researchers were so surprised that they spontaneously shouted out in German "Das ist ja toll!" which translates as "That's great!".
Toll-like receptors are now counted among the key molecules that alert the immune system to the presence of microbial infections. In 1996, "Toll" was found by Jules A. Hoffmann and his colleagues to have an essential role in the fly's immunity to fungal infection. It worked by activating the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides. Plant homologues were discovered in 1995 (rice XA21), and 2000 ("Arabidopsis" FLS2).
TLR 4 function as a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sensing receptor was discovered by Bruce A. Beutler and colleagues. These workers proved that mice which could not respond to LPS had mutations which abolished the function of TLR4. This identified TLR4 as one of the key components of the receptor for LPS.

Sports commentator

In sports broadcasting, a commentator is the person who is saying what is happening in the game. In the case of television commentary, the commentator is usually only heard and not often seen. In North American English, a commentator is also called an announcer or sportscaster. Often, the main commentator (called a play-by-play in North America) works with a color commentator and sometimes a sideline reporter. With big events, many sideline reporters are used. 
Most sports television broadcast have one play-by-play announcer and one color commentator. An example is NBC Sunday Night Football in the United States. It is called by Cris Collinsworth, a former American football receiver, and Al Michaels, a professional announcer. In the United Kingdom, there is not as much of a difference between play-by-play and color commentary. Two-man commentary teams usually have a person formal journalistic training but little or no sports experience leading the commentary, and an expert former (or current) competitor dealing with analysis. There are exceptions to this. All of the United Kingdom's major cricket and snooker commentators are former professionals in their sports. The well known Formula One racing commentator Murray Walker had no formal journalistic training and only a small amount of racing experience of his own.
Using a play-by-play announcer and one or more color commentators is standard . In the past it was much more common for a play-by-play announcer to work alone. 
Although sports broadcasts started in 1912, the first sports commentary was broadcast in April 1921. It was done by Florent Gibson of the Pittsburg Star newspaper. He was covering the fight between Johnny Ray and Johnny "Hutch" Dundee at the Motor Square Garden, Pittsburgh.
In the United States, nearly all professional sports teams, most collegiate teams have their own Sports commentators. These people are usually thought of as the voice of the team on radio broadcasts. They are often considered a part of the team like the players or the coaches. Television networks and cable channels will also have their own group of play-by-play announcers that work with different teams.

Cristoforo Ivanovich

Cristoforo Ivanovich (1628-1689; ; Montenegrin: "Krsto Ivanovic") was a "Marinist" poet from the Albania veneta of the Republic of Venice. He is the author of the first "History of Theater". He wrote in Italian -as in all his works- a critical chronology of opera drama done in Venice.
Ivanovich was born in Budua (now Montenegro) in 1628. He died in Venice in 1688. He was from an old Dalmatian family with roots in the original Dalmatian neolatin people of southern Illyria. 
From the time he was young, he showed love for poetry. He started composing when he was a teenager. At age 25 he moved to Italy, where he built a successful career as a scientist, wrote poetry, and became a highly esteemed writer of opera libretti. He then went to Verona in 1655, where he was a member of the "Accademia Filarmonica" and the "Accademia dei Temperati".
In 1657, he moved to Venice. He stayed there until his death in 1688. From 1663 he wrote celebrative writings, linked to the operatic market, that were presented in the theaters of Venice, Vienna and Piacenza. In his last years he wrote his most known work: "Le memorie teatrali di Venezia".
His main opera works, all in Italian, were the opera librettos: 
In 1681 he wrote what is considered by critics his most famous work, "Le memorie teatrali di Venezia", where he wanted to preserve the chronological history of theater and drama in Venice.

<doc id="362382" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=362382" title="Protein structure">
Protein structure

Protein structure describes how protein molecules are organised. This structure is what makes proteins work. 
Proteins are important biological macromolecules present in all organisms. They are polymers formed from 20 possible amino acids by RNA translation. Protein structures range in size from tens to several thousand amino acids.
After translation, proteins fold into specific shapes. This is not done by chemical bonds but by weaker forces such as hydrogen bonds. To understand how proteins work, it is often necessary to discover their three-dimensional structure. To do this biophysics uses techniques such as X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and dual polarisation interferometry.
A protein may switch from one shape to another as it does its job. The alternative states of the same protein are called conformations. An enzyme, for instance, will have at least two conformations: one with its co-enzyme and one without. The form with its coenzyme will have two conformations: one with its substrate and one without.
There are four distinct levels of protein structure.
The primary structure refers to amino acid linear sequence of the polypeptide chain. The primary structure is held together by covalent or peptide bonds, which are made during the process of protein biosynthesis or translation.
Secondary structure refers to highly regular local sub-structures. Two main types of secondary structure, the alpha helix and the beta strand (beta sheet), were suggested in 1951 by Linus Pauling and coworkers. These secondary structures are defined by patterns of hydrogen bonds between the main-chain peptide groups.
This is the shape (spatial organization) of an entire protein molecule. Protein folding is largely self-organising. It is mainly done by the protein's primary structure its sequence of amino acids. This is called Anfinsen's dogma. However, the environment in which a protein is synthesized and folds also effect its final shape.
If proteins are built of sub-units this gives another level of structure. This, the quaternary structure, is how the subunits fit together. Haemoglobin, for example, has two alpha and two beta chains. Both the alpha chains and beta chains are coded for by a cluster of six or seven genes, which provide the code for different versions of the molecule.

Megasthenes

Megasthenes (, ca. 350 – 290 BCE) was a Greek ethnographer and explorer in the Hellenistic period. He wrote the work "Indica". He was born in Asia Minor (now Turkey).
Arrian says that Megasthenes lived in Arachosia, with the satrap Sibyrtius. He visited India from there:
"Megasthenes lived with Sibyrtius, satrap of Arachosia, and often speaks of his visiting Sandracottus, the king of the Indians." Arrian, "Anabasis Alexandri" 
At the beginning of his "Indica", he speaks about the older Indians who know about when Dionysus and Hercules arrived in India. This story was very popular during the Alexandrian period. What he says about the religions of the Indians is important. He mentions the devotees of Heracles (Lord Krishna) and Dionysus (Lord Shiva or King Lord Indra). However, he does not mention Buddhists. This could mean that the religion was not well known before Ashoka took power.
Writers like Arrian, Strabo, Diodorus and Pliny refer to "Indica" in their works. Arrian said the best things about Megasthenes, but Strabo and Pliny do not treat him with as much respect. 
Megasthenes' "Indica" is the first well-known description of India by someone from the Western world.

<doc id="362692" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=362692" title="Super Bowl I">
Super Bowl I

Super Bowl I was the first championship game in professional American football. At the time it was called First AFL-NFL World Championship Game. It was played on January 15, 1967 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California. The National Football League (NFL) champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League (AFL) champion Kansas City Chiefs. The score was 35–10.
Super Bowl I was the only Super Bowl in history that was not a sellout in terms of attendance. Of the 94,000 seat capacity in the Coliseum, 33,000 went unsold.
The game was broadcast on NBC and CBS. It is the only Super Bowl to be on two television networks. Each network used its own announcers. Ray Scott, Jack Whitaker, and Frank Gifford were on CBS. Curt Gowdy and Paul Christman were on NBC.
The Chiefs entered the game after an 11-2-1 during the regular season. In the AFL Championship Game, they beat the Buffalo Bills, 31-7.
Kansas City's offense led the AFL in points scored (448) and total rushing yards (2,274). Their trio of running backs, Mike Garrett (801 yards), Bert Coan (521 yards), and Curtis McClinton (540 yards) all ranked among the top ten rushers in the AFL. Quarterback Len Dawson was the top rated passer in the AFL. He completed 159 out of 284 (56 percent) of his passes for 2,527 yards and 26 touchdowns. Wide receiver Otis Taylor had 58 receptions of 1,297 yards and 8touchdowns. Receiver Chris Burford added 58 receptions for 758 yards and 8 touchdowns. 
The Chiefs also had a strong defense. All-AFL players Jerry Mays and Buck Buchanan were on their line. Linebacker Bobby Bell was great at run stopping and pass coverage. The strongest part of their defense was their secondary, led by All-AFL safeties Johnny Robinson and Bobby Hunt, who each recorded 10 interceptions, and defensive back Fred Williamson, who recorded 4. Their Head Coach was Hank Stram.
The Packers were an NFL dynasty. They turned around what had been a losing team just eight years earlier. The team posted an NFL-worst 1–10–1 record in 1958. Then legendary head coach Vince Lombardi was hired in January 1959. Lombardi wanted to build a winning team. During the offseason, he signed Fred "Fuzzy" Thurston. Lombardi also made a big trade with the Cleveland Browns that brought three players to the team. These players became an important part of the defense: linemen Henry Jordan, Willie Davis, and Bill Quinlan.
Lombardi's hard work paid off. The Packers improved to a 7–5 regular season record in 1959. They surprised the league during the following year by making it all the way to the 1960 NFL Championship Game. The Packers lost 17–13 to the Philadelphia Eagles. But they showed that they were no longer losers. Green Bay went on to win NFL Championships in 1961, 1962, 1965, 1966, and 1967.
Packers quarterback Bart Starr was the top-rated quarterback in the NFL for 1966. He won the NFL Most Valuable Player Award, completing 156 out of 251 (62.2 percent) passes for 2,257 yards, 14 touchdowns, and only 3 interceptions. His top targets were wide receivers Boyd Dowler and Carroll Dale. They combined for 63 receptions for 1,336 yards. Fullback Jim Taylor was the team's top rusher with 705 yards, and also caught 41 passes for 331 yards. The Packers offensive line was also big reason for the team's success. They were led by All-Pro guards Jerry Kramer and Thurston, along with Forrest Gregg.
The first Super Bowl halftime show had American trumpeter Al Hirt, and the marching bands from the University of Arizona and Grambling State University. 
The postgame, trophy presentation ceremony was handled by CBS' Pat Summerall and NBC's George Ratterman. Summerall and Ratterman had to share a single microphone.

For example, "Sadae" is shown in the actions of the weaker state as it conveys goodwill and respect through its envoys. 
The term "sadae" is also used to explain Korean diplomacy before the establishment of the Joseon kingdom.
The historical term is derived from the Chinese "shi da" (Korean, "sadae") as used by the philosopher Mencius. "Sadae" literally means "dealing with the great" or "serving the great." 
"Sadae" establishes a framework with China as the center of a Confucian moral universe.
"Ssadae" is contrasted with limited trade relationships with other neighboring countries such as Japan.
The concept of "sadae" was rejected by Korean nationalists in the 20th century.

<doc id="363163" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=363163" title="Badlands">
Badlands

Badlands are a type of dry terrain which is extremely difficult to move across.
It happens when softer rock is eroded by wind and water, leaving harder rock sticking up. Canyons, ravines, gullies and other such geological forms are common in badlands. They are very difficult to cross by foot, on horse, or by car. Dry badlands may have spectacular colour displays that range from dark black/blue coal strata to bright clays and sandstone.
The term 'badlands' is apt: badlands have steep slopes, loose dry soil, slick clay, and deep sand, all of which act against travel and other uses. They form in dry regions with infrequent but intense rain-showers, little vegetation, and soft sediments which get massive erosion.
Some of the most famous fossil beds are found in badlands, where erosion rapidly exposes the sedimentary layers and the scant cover of vegetation makes surveying and fossil hunting relatively easy.
Coal seams get exposed in some badlands, so some coal mining districts have developed in badlands areas. An example of this is the Drumheller district of the Red Deer River in Alberta, where the Atlas Coal Mine historical site shows the last of 139 mines which operated in the badlands.
Some of the best-known badland formations can be found in the United States and Canada. In the U.S., Makoshika State Park in Montana, Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota and Badlands National Park in South Dakota together form a series of extensive badland formations. Dinosaur National Monument in Colorado and Utah are also badlands settings.
The Big Muddy Badlands in Saskatchewan, Canada, gained notoriety as a hideout for outlaws. There is a large badland area in Alberta, Canada, particularly in the valley of the Red Deer River (where Dinosaur Provincial Park is) and in Drumheller, Alberta where the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology is.
A well-known badlands formation in New Zealand, the Putangirua Pinnacles – formed by the erosion of the conglomerate of an old river delta – are at the head of a small valley near the southern tip of the North Island.

Black-billed magpie

The black-billed magpie ("Pica hudsonia") is a magpie, a type of songbird. It is a medium-sized member of the crow family with glossy black and white plumage and a black beak. The black-billed magpie lives in North America west of the Appalaches and north of the big Deserts. It can be found in temperate, open landscape. It is an omnivorous species: Insects, carrion and seeds are its main food, but it also takes small vertebrates and eggs. The breeding season of the black-billed magpie starts in May and it takes until the end of June for all chicks to fledge. The birds breed in solitary pairs that stay together for life.
In the genus "Pica", the species is closest to the North American yellow-billed magpie ("P. nuttalli"). Both species share a common ancestor that migrated from Kamtchatka to Alaska some time in the Pleistocene. Black-billed and yellow-billed magpie diverged as a result of the glaciation of the Rocky Mountains. The yellow-billed magpie became isolated in the warm climate of California and [adapted]] to it. The species' population is stable and it is currently not considered as endangered.

He studied at the Leipzig Conservatory with Hans Becker, and later with Eugène Ysaÿe in Brussels, and for two summers with Jacques Thibaud in France. He became leader of the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra and the Royal Opera Orchestra in Brussels. In 1912 he returned to the USA and played with the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski. In 1915 he was appointed leader and assistant conductor of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. He followed Leopold Auer in 1930 as a teacher at the Juilliard School, in New York.

Geddes Plan for Tel Aviv

The Geddes Plan for Tel Aviv was the first master city plan for Tel Aviv. It was designed in 1925-1929 by the Scottish city planner Sir Patrick Geddes. This program designed the center of Tel Aviv and the area now known as "Old North".
In 1925 Patrick Geddes was commissioned to design a master plan for the city of Tel Aviv. The plan he produced was accepted in 1929. Tel Aviv turned out to be the only example of one of Geddes’ plans being built largely as he envisaged and is a good example of an early planned city. The area of Tel Aviv originally planned by Geddes makes up approximately 7.5% of the current day municipality of Tel Aviv and is now known as Tel Aviv’s “Old North”. It was designed to be an extension of the much older neighboring Arabic port town Jaffa to the south and a home for the increasing population of Jews emigrating from other parts of the world (predominantly Eastern Europe).
Geddes, originally as biologist and sociologist was engaged to design a plan for the new city of Tel Aviv to be built adjacent to the ancient port town of Jaffa. The principles he employed for the city were strikingly similar to what we now know as New Urbanism ideas of planning - an emphasis was placed on pedestrians as opposed to motor car traffic, a sense of community and civic life was encouraged through the use of town squares and abundant planting of greenery provided significant focus on a minimal environmental footprint. Private automobile traffic was minimised and the city was envisaged on a pedestrian-scale. This neighborhood identity has been crucial in the success of Tel Aviv as a city.
Another important aspect of Geddes plan was the use of the “super block,” which was popular in the early to mid 20th century with its origins in the modernist movement. The main principles was to create extra large blocks bounded by major rather than minor roads, and have them threaded with narrow one way streets designed in such a way to discourage through traffic. The aim of these superblocks was to foster community and a sense of civic life within them. In order to achieved this it was planned that at the centre of each block was meant to be a central public space (a garden or public building). In reality the commercial factors resulted in few of these central squares being captured for public use.
Geddes took part of his inspiration from the Garden City movement developed by Ebenezer Howard, he was keen to ensure that greenery was an integral part of the Tel Aviv landscame. To this end, under his plan buildings were restricted to taking up a maximum of only one third of any given site, these restrictions aimed to ensure maximum potential for neighborhoods well endowed with lush greenery.
Geddes did not prescribe a certain architectural style for the area, traditionally a city planned of along the lines of the British Garden City Movement would aim for an architectural style based on the traditional style for the region. Geddes recognised that the majority of the population he was designing for would be immigrants from Europe and other parts of the world. He encouraged the development of a distinctly ‘Jewish style’. Interestingly Geddes provide little more that this style recommendations in his planning report.
Over the following decades after Geddes plan was realised the area began to decay and theer was significant public lament and dissatisfaction with the decay of the city. This deterioration was later used as justification for the rapid redevelopment of the area in the 1950s. However it was noted that this disapproval of the decay of the city quickly changed to nostalgia when old buildings began being razed to make way for new development. Resultantly significant effort was made to preserve the historical neighborhoods planned by Geddes and in 1984 the Council for the Preservation of buildings and Sites was established to protect them.
Critics of Tel Aviv’s layout have suggested it is not a beautiful city in the classic sense. A low standard of construction and of housing units (apartment buildings) has largely been blamed for this, citing that the buildings developed were ugly and akin to stacks of packing cases with shoeboxes for balconies.
Further criticism has been put that the city has not coped well with the increasing population and private car traffic not envisaged by Geddes at the time. Poor building construction and lack of proper maintenances have served as further critiques of the early city planning.
Notwithstanding these criticisms of Geddes planning of Tel Aviv, while not immune to the modern problems of traffic and development that all cities today face, Tel Aviv is widely regarded as a successful city and symbol of modern day Israel.

Dear Twinkler,
You have been directed here because you are using an old version of the . A new version for SEWP has been available since September 2012 and brings many improvements, whereas the old version is no longer maintained and has become more and more outdated and broken. For that reason, the old scripts have now been deactivated.

I see many red links . Is there a special rule concerning the creation/transwikification of policies and guidelines which exist on main English Wikipedia? Greets, -- () 17:32, 8 September 2012 (UTC)
Here on SEWP, the information about not using Wikipedia or its mirrors, etc. as sources is in the "guideline" of citing sources. On enwiki, it is in the "policy" of verifiability. I started to move it to the same policy here, then decided I should bring it up for discussion first. Comments? -- () 13:17, 9 September 2012 (UTC)
Is there an easy way of submitting a request for someone to write up a Simple Wikipedia article on a given topic? I spent a while looking for it earlier but couldn't find anything.
(Apologies if this message isn't in your language.) 
As some of you might already have heard Wikimedia Deutschland is working on a new Wikimedia project. It is called . The goal of Wikidata is to become a central data repository for the Wikipedias, its sister projects and the world. In the future it will hold data like the number of inhabitants of a country, the date of birth of a famous person or the length of a river. These can then be used in all Wikimedia projects and outside of them.
The project is divided into three phases and "we are getting close to roll-out the first phase". The phases are:
It'd be great if you could join us, test the demo version, provide feedback and take part in the development of Wikidata. You can find all the relevant information including an and sign-up links for our on-wiki newsletter on . 
For further discussions please use (if you are uncomfortable writing in English you can also write in your native language there) or point to the place where your discussion is happening so I can answer there.

Why do we not have a category "Transport"? Why do we sometimes use the longer word "Transportation" (which conveys no extra meaning), and sometimes the simpler word "Transport"? I recommend wholesale use of the word "Transport" for categories involving movement of people or goods. () 06:39, 6 September 2012 (UTC)
Should we considering whether and the thread above presents a False dilemma. This is not an issue which divides nicely into an issue of spelling nor something to do with either American English or Commonwealth English.

How do I create a new article? () 02:18, 11 September 2012 (UTC)PacificWarrior101
I've become increasingly aware that unregistered users are allowed to use this formula instead of actually saying what they are doing. This has the effect that anyone watching a range of pages must check what has been done, item by item. Unregistered users can never be trusted, and even auto-confirmed registered users need close watching for the first few months. 
There is a good reason why the 'Change summary' box should be properly filled in. "It helps other users" to know what you are doing to a page in which they may have an interest. This is a community, and it is discourteous for a user who knows little or nothing about this wiki to make changes without a summary. Large changes (even by registered but inexperienced users) should be prefaced by an explanation on the talk page. In general, talk pages are underused on this wiki, and administrators might need to remind some users... 
Anyway, I think we should restrict the use of the 'updated' formula to experienced users. () 07:20, 4 September 2012 (UTC)
Ugh absolutely not. I hate wikis that force edit summaries. They do nothing but force people to enter bad edit summaries. Edit summaries should never be mandatory. Are they good practice when making changes that might confuse people? Sure of course they are. But in the vast majority of changes they are unnecessary and forcing people to use them are more likely to cause unhelpful or even bad edit summaries to be added. - () 12:27, 4 September 2012 (UTC)
Do we need this page? It's been imported from and it seems like it's for wiki development, rather than anything to do with SEWP. () 03:54, 11 September 2012 (UTC)
I'm not sure whether there is still an objection here. Should I delete the import? I guess I can take it to RFD...? () 07:27, 14 September 2012 (UTC)
A few years back, an template was added to the Christianity article. Since there have been many edits since then, and no discussion, a removal of the template was proposed. It will be removed in about two weeks, unless someone steps forward and points out issues (relating to neurality) to be fixed. -- () 21:22, 13 September 2012 (UTC)
There is an interesting article in the new "Signpost" on English Wikipedia: . The article is "not" "simple". :) () 13:23, 11 September 2012 (UTC)
Yeah the problem is that people have been copying over articles from en.wiki and then simplifying them over the last couple years. When previously people were writing simple articles from scratch. We should really be getting back to the writing from scratch way of things, but I doubt that will happen because people are inherently lazy. - () 14:08, 11 September 2012 (UTC)
This is what I like to call a typical "So what?" research article. The data is freely available, and the tools to generate some numbers are easy to use. But, so what? What is the actual relationship between Flesch Reading Ease and readability? They fail to demonstrate that, so the numbers don't mean anything to actual readers. Quote: "the whole concept of readability cannot be covered". Then don't present this as having anything to do with serving readers.
Plus, their methodology is pretty weak. They remove all of the headings and incomplete sentences. Yet, any editor knows that good use of headings and image captions can make a text much easier to understand. But, if they don't do that, their handy, convenient measurement won't work. Pretty poor. Also, it would have been reasonable to exclude every article on SEWP that is tagged complex from the sample. The community has marked these specifically for readers as not simple. These articles are basically placeholder texts there to be simplified. How about vocabulary frequency (common or uncommon vocabulary) and vocabulary recycling (how aften a word occurs in the text)? I could go on, but I won't. 
Finally, they seem to be unaware of newer, more sophisticated tools like Coh-Metrix that go some way towards identifying writing qualities and measuring things like coherence and cohesion that are critical to ease of understanding. () 05:34, 12 September 2012 (UTC)
Interesting research indeed, although I thought we had agreed many months back that readability tools weren't right for measuring simplicity. I think DJ has a point: people are too lazy to write from scratch. Why don't we put a stop to importing articles from enwp, and encourage writing from scratch? Maybe we should also focus on simplification a little more (you only have to look at the category "complex pages" to see what I mean...) as after all, that is what SEWP is about. Maybe setting some objectives would help. Or we could go for a more ruthless approach on complex pages, and delete them within a certain period if they aren't being simplified (this could be applied retro-actively, or could be only for new articles - we'd have to decide). Just a few suggestions. Good evening. 21:51, 13 September 2012 (UTC)
I learned about Project RENDER, which is partly EU funded. Its aim is to provide tools that help improve article quality. One of these is the Link extractor; it compares different language versions of a Wikipedia article. It builds a set containing the links present in all versions. These are then classified along three criteria:
If I do this for Evolution, one of our VGAs, I find that there are 140 links in common; of these 30 have no article, and 61 are not linked (for whatever reason). >Note that this is no criticism of the evolution article, I just took an example. I wondered if such metrics can help us in the VGA process, in any way.-- () 21:57, 11 September 2012 (UTC)
Thank you for your helpful feedback. We have improved the code of LEA. So, please test it again here. The new version ignores red links and only considers links within the article namespace. Additionally, it resolves redirects. Further ideas and feedback are very welcome via render@wikimedia.de or on . -- () 11:52, 19 September 2012 (UTC)
Twinkle seems to have stopped working for me. Any clues??-- () 04:18, 18 September 2012 (UTC)
Adding block notices to talk pages still isn't working. It just stops half way through and never does it. () 05:49, 18 September 2012 (UTC)
Okay, I've fixed the twinklewarn module (and added support for , thanks Osiris). I think the script can now replace version 1. I can do this if nobody opposes. -- 22:12, 18 September 2012 (UTC)
Hi I have added a new entry (Beaverton, Oregon). How do you add links to other wiki entries? Thanks
There are a bunch of other ways to link, mainly dealing with other websites or other parts of Wikipedia (such as the English Wikipedia or German wikipedia) but those two are the main ways to link that most editors need to understand. Someone already came behind you on the Beaverton article and "wikified" (linked terms to other pages) much of the page for you. Click the change button and look at way they did it and then play around in the and you should be able to quickly understand how it works a bit better. -- 03:37, 20 September 2012 (UTC)
Going through the complex pages backlog, I've come accross the article entitled "Problems of Wikipedia". I understand why this might have been named like this (trying to make the page name simpler), but other languages use "Criticism" isntead of "Problems". I think we should use the same as it is important to be precise when naming pages, but I prefer to ask here before being . A second opinion would be welcome. 11:17, 7 September 2012 (UTC)
I was going to leave this for Yottie, but it's been a while so I moved the article. () 03:52, 21 September 2012 (UTC)
What happened to the box at the top of ? The text isn't wrapping any more, so you have to scroll right to see everything. -- () 19:47, 21 September 2012 (UTC)
It was suggested that we find criteria to evaluate the "simplicity" of articles, and to improve them. I am not into linguistics, but ideally, I would like to see:
If there are any linguists out there, are there any methods that meet at least some of the criteria? -- () 20:02, 21 September 2012 (UTC)
I very much respect Peter's opinion and his practical results in editing. But, so far as science is concerned, pages must be accurate, though (of course) simplified. That accuracy demands a certain use of technical terms. These terms inevitably raise readability levels: a page on an advanced topic will be lucky to reach 55 on the Flesch scale, let alone 70. The terms must be explained, or linked to proper explanations (or wiktionary entries). Articles on technical topics must have "substance", or they are fakes. As I said earlier, because Flesch (and other measures of difficulty) do not take into account the network-like hypertext, they ignore one of the reader's most important options when reading text. Editors should use any formula or method they find helpful; and they can try to write more clearly. Some topics, however, are always going to be difficult to explain. One main reason is that we cannot control a reader's entry knowledge. Much of regular education is an excercise on laying foundations, and building steadily on those foundations. If someone jumps into a technical page with no previous knowledge, well, yes, it's going to be difficult for them! () 11:18, 23 September 2012 (UTC)

Hello,
We do have articles about Amish, Hutterites and Mennonites. These (Protestant Christian) groups are somewhat related; they do have a "common history". Since our articles about these groups are fairly small (in the order of perhaps 2-3 paragraphs), I wondered whether we should merge them (probably under Mennonites). I have had a quick look, and the articles "lack sourcing", to say the least; they have also been "relatively stable" (as in: untouched, except for bot edits) in the last few years. Compared ot other movements, they are relatively small, too. Sources will probably reflect the shared history as well; what is true for one group may (partly) apply to the others. When work is put in, and the part about one of the groups shows massive development, we can extract that part to a separate article again.
I see this as a "purely practical" means; I do not want to offend any Hutterite with the claim that there is only one article, about 2-3 groups, with similar history, and perhaps only "superficial" differences. Any thoughts? -- () 16:00, 23 September 2012 (UTC)
While related these are very different religions. It would not be right to merge them into a single article. That would be like merging Muslims and Catholics into the same article because they have the same root as well. - () 11:24, 24 September 2012 (UTC)
I've seen a few discussions going on recently about this criterion. I think it would be good if everyone (taggers, sysops) were a little clearer on how it applies. See the following, for example, which were deleted using this criterion and restored or objected to yesterday on the argument that it doesn't apply to them.
In these cases, no other details were included. Do we need to see a claim to notability in these professions? Or are these professions notable by nature?
If it's the latter, why doesn't it apply to this one?
Would being a regular filmmaker be a claim to notabilty?
Another contained more detail,
But it wasn't an attribute considered notable by sporting notability guidelines. If we match claims against notability criteria, is it acceptable to quick-delete the article if the claim isn't considered notable enough?
Are the taggers or reviewing admins expected to look for whether the subject is notable? Is it acceptable to request quick deletion for people that can be identified as notable by looking at other websites?
Djsasso made the objections and restorations, so I'll ask him personally to answer some of these questions. But it'd also be better if this were a community discussion so that we can all get a clearer idea of where this criterion applies and everyone is on the same page. () 00:55, 28 September 2012 (UTC)
I am one of the taggers. I agree with Mac ("an occupation by itself cannot justify notability, but a specific post (eg Minister of Defence) may do") and Osiris ("I don't think I agree that listing someone's professions is a claim of any sort"). When I look at these things, I ask myself if the claims or stated facts could apply to any member of the general public. If any non-notable person could be considered to be an artist, a photographer, an actor, an athlete, a writer, or whatever the statement is, then I don't think it shows notability. For example, anyone could write a biography of Barack Obama, even a student doing an assignment, but not just anyone could have it published by a major publishing house. I think DJSasso's ideas of what constitutes a claim of notability are pretty subjective. S/he has disagreed with me several times on QDing articles, which is fine, but I often don't understand why s/he thinks a certain phrase claims notability. This would be easier if we required refs on biographies, but we don't. -- () 16:11, 28 September 2012 (UTC)
Again, such a large discussion for something rather insignificant... The fact is, most articles dubiously deleted under the QD A4 criterion are short stubs, which would probably sit there for years before being expanded. I think we should just adopt a strict policy on stubs, to avoid SEWP becoming even more of a "stub depository". If the articles aren't stubs, then RFD. If really in doubt about a "long stub", then RFD. But one/two/three/four liners, although they may be about a notable subject/person, are hardly worthy of inclusion as they clearly don't add anything to the wiki. If you are worried about scaring people away because the stub was clearly done in good faith, then drop them a line and advise them it needs to be longer, otherwise it will be deleted. If the problem is notability rather than length, kindly explain it doesn't have a place on SEWP. 18:10, 28 September 2012 (UTC)
I am surprised that this topic has caused so much discusion. QDA4 is for times there is NO claim of notability. We get these articles on occasion "Joe is super cool and has great hair." Very clear there is no notability. If there is a "shred" of possibility that the people, groups, companies or websites written about "might" be notable, another QD reason or RFD needs to be used. In my example above, QDA1 could also apply to some of these articles as there is no useful information. I encourage those who are struggling with the reason DJSasso undid the requests to read . Several of the arguments for QD found in the above discussion can be found under the section "Not quick deletion criteria". 
What is notability? We have a guideline at . For those who would like more indepth ideas about notability in certain professions we can refer to English. See Category:Wikipedia notability guidelines. While we are not beholden to follow English, these guidelines have had extensive discussion and refining. They are an excellent base.
As for Horeki's concerns about "The article must provide reliable sources showing that the subject meets the general notability guideline" that is for RFD not Quick Deletion. 
And the idea of requiring a certain length to create an article, goes against the founding principles of Wikipedia. Plus, in my opinion, is elitist as hell. We expect articles to grow over time, even if it takes 12 years. Having a small stub provides readers with basic information. And see above, the guideline for what does NOT count for QD includes short articles. And if someone has an issue, anyone can edit, feel free to work on expanding. Horeki has an issue with the mass creation of football articles, and he has been fixing them. I don't like unreferenced BLP's so I've slowly been working on them. We have no timeline so it's fine if it takes months or even years.-- () 20:19, 28 September 2012 (UTC)
Take a look at one of our Very Good Articles Saturn (planet). When it was created it was 4 sentences long. Essentially Saturn is a planet and it has rings. Give the article some time and it becomes a VGA. Should we have deleted it because it was too short? No way. Start with what someone is willing and capable of doing and improve from there. Collaboration - a main concept of wikipedia.
And as for deleting truly small articles, we have QDA1. This can be used for an article so sparse that it conveys no useful information. So instead of an arictle saying "an apple is a fruit" an article of "an apple can be red". -- () 23:49, 28 September 2012 (UTC)
Very often, a decision what to do with a QD candidate has to be made. I have come across many cases where people wrote some nonsense; but under the heading of a subject that is notable. Similarly, we get a number of false positives. This is an example I found this morning. The text was later tagged for QD by a bot, and I have since replaced it with the blurb of the enwp article, with attribution. An IP created this article. I see similar cases quite a lot: Putting in 10-15 mins of work can avert the deletion; the original author retains their "moral rights", and we get a valid stub (see here). As to notability, it it very difficult to judge. Horace Greeley (1811-1872), Joseph Pulitzer (1847-1911) and William Randolph Hearst (1863-1951) were newspaper publishers/media tycoons. They influenced the media history of the US a great deal; does this now mean that owning a few newspapers will make you notable? - Will we talk about Silvio Berlusconi or Rupert Murdoch in the same manner, fifty years from now?

Just wanted to point out that in our template , images do not work. I have tried two of them, both from commons, and they do not display. -- () 10:37, 30 September 2012 (UTC)
At what point do we at least set a pause for a disruptive editor like 
These are just more unwikified lists:
The editor(s) using the IP never respond to messages on the Talk page. Time for a time out to get their attention? Remember and ? Before there are a thousand stubs to fix, please. () 13:37, 3 October 2012 (UTC)
I think it would be better for Ip addresses to not be able to create page.Like on most other Wikimedia projects. () 18:28, 3 October 2012 (UTC)
There is a big backlog on New Pages where tons of sportscaster pages from an IP editor have piled up. These are generally not wikified, referenced, or readable. I tried to wade in there and fixed up Dave O'Brien. I thought that could be an example for the editor. Then, the more I thought about it, should these be deleted under NOTSTATSBOOK. How about Eric Clemons? They are not athlete stats, but many of the the stubs are just lists of teams/sports covered. Anyone else have any thoughts on these or how best to proceed? I'm really not interested in cleaning up hundreds of these but the New Pages queue needs attention. As side issues, no attribution to En wiki either, which is where this info seems to have come from, and BLP problems too. Thanks, () 04:05, 20 September 2012 (UTC)
Thank you for raising this issue, Gotanda. I patrolled probably a few dozen of these and was getting tired of them -- I was reminded of the Japanese footballer articles. I also left a message about this. I would support deleting most or all of them, as well as some of the categories they're in. I removed some categories as I was patrolling (such as one for high school sports commentators), but I suspect some I removed are now back in the new articles. -- () 10:16, 20 September 2012 (UTC)
I should point out before this witchhunt goes to far. That he is breaking no policy unless he is copy and pasting directly. Quality of articles is not a blockable offense. No one is required to follow a given format or add references or categories should they choose not to. That being said the content could then be deleted or fixed. But they still aren't "required" to do so. Any blocking based on the quality of articles made in good faith would be an abuse. I do agree the quality is quite poor, but this isn't block worthy unless there are copy vios. - () 12:26, 20 September 2012 (UTC)
The editor has created a huge amount of articles, as one might see on the unpatrolled new pages. I'll do me best in wikifying and patrolling them and I invite everyone to participate with, because I think that improving is always better than deleting. -- 23:41, 20 September 2012 (UTC)
I agree: mass RFD them, and keep any that are rescued during the process. () 03:49, 21 September 2012 (UTC)
Any of these that we keep, I'd like to change the categories from "Foo broadcasters" to "Foo commentators" or "Foo announcers". To me, "broadcasters" would be a TV channel or network. -- () 23:29, 21 September 2012 (UTC)
So what did we decide here? There are a bunch more, at least some of which are basically just a list of jobs. -- () 02:20, 6 October 2012 (UTC)
Is there any reason we can't adopt such a process similar to (PROD)? In this flood of sportscaster stubs, it would have been far easier to put a tag on the first 20 stubs? 40 stubs? 60 stubs? It is likely that this would have encouraged a constructive response? -- () 17:22, 26 September 2012 (UTC)
Is there any reason we can't adopt such a process similar to (BLP PROD)? In this flood of sportscaster stubs, it would have been far easier to put a tag on the first 20 stubs? 40 stubs? 60 stubs? It is likely that this would have encouraged a constructive response? -- () 19:09, 26 September 2012 (UTC)
It's an interesting proposal, Horeki. I know that you're looking for a practical solution to these "dumps" of unreferenced, maybe-notable stubs that we occasionally get hit with. The PROD process would probably be sufficiently preventative in some cases (for the footballer accounts, "Is it not likely that this action would have produced a few immediate and constructive changes in their stub creation process?" – yes, I'm sure it would have). But perhaps not in the case of anonymous users or brand-new users. I suppose the best thing, in my opinion, would be to identify these mass BLP creations as problems early on. Warn the user that mass creation of unsourced BLPs is against policy, and, if the articles are in a dubious state, send them to RFD. It is, essentially, the same process and should get the same response from the author. PROD is probably less likely to work here where there often won't be anyone interested in rescuing obscure biographies. () 22:44, 26 September 2012 (UTC)
@ Tbennert -- Is it possible that you vastly underestimate the scope of the problem? For example, created nearly 50 new articles at an extraordinary pace in just one session in February 2012. Do we really need to survey the full history in order to recognize the scale of the problem? 
The flood of sportscaster stubs make up a limited example of a problem which is not unique or trivial. -- () 02:24, 27 September 2012 (UTC)

The "lesbian kiss episode" is a type of the media portrayal of lesbianism in television media. It was made in the 1990s. The first time was in 1991 with a kiss on the American "L.A. Law" series. It was in the episode "He's a Crowd" between C.J. Lamb and Abby Perkins. David E. Kelley wrote the episode. He used the same idea in at least two of his other shows. Later television series included an episode in which a seemingly heterosexual female character has a kiss with a possibly lesbian or bisexual character. Most times, the potential of a relationship between the women does not survive past the episode. The lesbian or suspected lesbian never appears again.

Dendrochronology

Dendrochronology is tree-ring dating. It is a method of dating which uses the patterns of growth rings in trees. In many types of wood, the time rings were formed can be dated to the exact calendar year. 
Dendrochronology has three main uses: 
In some parts of the world, it is possible to date wood back a few thousand years, or even many thousands. The maximum for "fully anchored chronologies" is a little over 11,000 years from present. The term "fully anchored chronology" means the dates are absolutely certain.
Dendrochronology (word derived from Greek , "dendron", "tree limb"; , "khronos", "time"; and , "-logia") was developed during the first half of the 20th century originally by the astronomer A.E. Douglass, who founded the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona. Douglass researched sunspot activity. He expected changes in solar activity would affect climate patterns on Earth. The climate would be recorded by tree-ring growth patterns.
The phenomenon of tree rings and their relationship with wet and dry years had been noticed before Douglass. There is a brief note in one of Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks, and Charles Babbage in 1837 came up with the same idea.
Many trees in temperate zones make one growth ring each year, with the newest adjacent to the bark. Through a tree's life, a year-by-year ring pattern is formed which reflects the climatic conditions in which the tree grew. Adequate moisture and a long growing season result in a wide ring. A drought year may result in a very narrow one. 
Alternating poor and favorable conditions, such as mid summer droughts, can result in several rings forming in a given year. Problems like this are fixed by comparing one part of the world with another. Missing rings are rare in oak and elm trees: the only recorded instance of a missing ring in oak trees occurred in the year 1816, also known as the Year without a Summer. 
Trees from the same region will tend to develop the same patterns of ring widths for a given period. These patterns can be compared and matched ring for ring with trees growing in the same geographical zone and under similar climatic conditions. Following these tree-ring patterns from living trees back through time, chronologies can be built up, both for entire regions, and for sub-regions of the world. Thus wood from ancient structures can be matched to known chronologies (a technique called cross-dating) and the age of the wood determined precisely. 
The tree-ring dates can be extended back to 26,000 BP by using other methods. Those other methods use marine sediment layers and growth rings in corals.

Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology

The Royal Tyrrell Museum is a popular Canadian tourist attraction. It is a leading centre of palaeontological research which has more than 130,000 fossils.
The museum is from Drumheller, Alberta and from Calgary. It is in the middle of the fossil-bearing strata of the Upper Cretaceous Horseshoe Canyon Formation. Its specimens come mainly from Dinosaur Provincial Park and the Devil's Coulee Dinosaur Egg Historic Nest Site.
The Royal Tyrrell Museum's mission is to "collect, preserve, research and interpret palaeontological history with special reference to Alberta’s fossil heritage". 
The Museum is named in honour of Joseph Tyrrell, a geologist who discovered the first dinosaur in the Red Deer River Valley in 1884. The Museum opened September 25, 1985 and was given Royal status by Queen Elizabeth II in 1990. In its first year of operation, the Museum attracted over 500,000 visitors. The average annual number of visitors is about 400,000. In 2010 the museum welcomed its 10-millionth visitor, a young boy from Edmonton.
More than of the museum's is dedicated to exhibits. There are chronological galleries celebrating the 3.9 billion year history of life on Earth. One of the most popular is "Dinosaur Hall", with almost 40 mounted dinosaur skeletons, including specimens of "Tyrannosaurus rex" and "Albertosaurus". Other exhibits include "Lords of the Land"; "Burgess Shale"; "Devonian Reef", a life-size model of a 375 million year old reef; a "Cretaceous Garden", with over 600 living species of plants; "Age of Mammals"; and "Ice Ages". 
"Triassic Giant" is a long specimen of the largest known marine reptile. The long ichthyosaur "Shonisaurus sikanniensis" was recovered from the shores of the Sikanni Chief River in northeastern British Columbia.
A window into the "Preparation Lab" allows visitors to watch technicians as they carefully prepare fossils for research and exhibition. There are also tours of the badlands; the hands-on "Nexen Science Hall" with interactive exhibits; simulated fossil digs, and summer camps for children and families, and much more.

Witenagemot

The Witenagemot or Witan was an institution in Anglo-Saxon England, from about the 7th to the 11th century. The name is Old English and means "council of the wise men". Originally, Witan was the plural of "wita" (the wise man); but it was used as a singular. The council was similar to the Germanic assembly called "Thing". 
The purpose of the Witenagemot was to give an opinion about the administration and the organisation of the kingdom. They talked about how law should develop. They elected or confirmed the king. The Witenagemot also had the power to depose a king. This happened when they deposed Sigeberht of Wessex in 755. They also deposed Æthelwald Moll of Northumbria in 765.
Witans were held at least once a year; usually more often. In many respects they were similar to modern-day Parliament. Unlike Parliament, the locations where they were held changed; neither the Witans nor the king had a permanent place to stay. 
When the Normans invaded England in 1066, they replaced the Witenagemot with another institution. This institution was still known as Witan or Witenagemot until the 12th century.

Chorea

Chorea (sometimes called Choreia) is the name for a set of symptoms caused by some neurological conditions. The word "chorea" comes from Greek, where it means "dance". People with chorea move without being able to control those movements. The movements seem to spread from one muscle to the next. 
Chorea is one of the main symptoms of Huntington's disease. 
Some forms of chorea are not linked to neurological conditions, though. Chorea can develop as a complication of pregnancy. It can be a sign of hyperthyroidism. It can also be caused by drugs taken in the wrong dose. For example, L-Dopa (taken against Parkinson's disease), certain forms of birth control, or certain antipsychotics can cause chorea if they are used in the wrong doses.

Vermouth is a sweet wine, that has been converted to a spirit. It usually has between 15 and 18 percent of alcohol. Also, certain herbs are added to flavour the wine. Its name is derived from a plant called Artemisia absinthium, which makes it taste slightly bitter. It is often used for cocktails. In its current form, Vermouth was first made in Turin, in 1757. In the 19th century, it was also produced in France. Vermouth is sometimes used as a substitute for white wine in cooking. 
Vermouth is not the same as the spirit called Absinthe. Absinthe is also based on Artemisia absinthium, but it has 45-50 percent alcohol per volume.

Natural killer cell

Natural killer cells (or NK cells) are a type of lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system. NK cells provide a rapid response to cells infected by viruses, or to bacterial cells. The response happens about 3 days after infection. NK cells also respond to tumour formation. 
NK cells are unique: they have the ability to recognise stressed cells in the absence of antibodies and major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This allows for a much faster immune reaction.
In early experiments in cancer patients and animals, investigators found what was called a "natural" reactivity. That is, a certain population of cells seemed to be able to kill tumour cells without previously being sensitized to them. At first many thought that these observations were artifacts. However, by 1973, 'natural killing' activity was established across a wide variety of species, and the existence of a separate line of cells with this ability was suggested.
To control their cytotoxic activity, NK cells have two types of surface receptors: activating receptors and inhibitory receptors. When the NK cell is activated, it destroys the cells which have switched it on. 
Small granules in their cytoplasm contain proteins and enzymes called granzymes. They are released close to a cell which has triggered their action. A protein "perforin" forms pores in the cell membrane of the target cell, creating a channel through which enzymes and other molecules can enter. This kills the target cell. The details vary according to whether the target is a virus, a bacterium or a tumour cell.
These inhibitory receptors recognize MHC class I molecules, which could explain why NK cells kill cells with low levels of MHC class I molecules. This inhibition is crucial to the role played by NK cells. MHC class I molecules are main way cells display viral or tumor antigens to cytotoxic T-cells. A common evolutionary adaptation to this seen in both intracellular microbes and tumours is a long-term down-regulation of these MHC I molecules. This makes the cells impervious to T-cell action. NK cells may have evolved as an evolutionary response: the loss of MHC would deprive these cells of the inhibitory effect of MHC and make them vulnerable to NK cell attack.
The "adaptive" immune response generates memory cells after a primary infection. Then there is a rapid response to later infections by the same antigen. Earlier it was thought that NK cells play no role in the adaptive immune responses, but now it seems they do.

Hospitality

Hospitality is about people welcoming other people into their homes or other places where they work or spend their time. People who welcome visitors are called hosts. The people they welcome are called guests.
The word "hospitality" comes from the Latin "hospes", which came from the word "hostis", which originally meant "to have power."
Hospitality is all about the art of entertaining or receiving guests. We talk about "offering hospitality". There are many different ideas about how to offer hospitality according to the various cultures in the world. In the past, many societies taught that it was always right to offer hospitality to strangers who came to their door in need of food or shelter. This may seem a strange idea to many of us today, but it was an important way to survive in many societies, especially in lands where people travelled long distances, often far away from large towns.
The words hospital, hospice, and hostel also come from the word "hospitality". They are all about giving personal care to people who are away from their homes.

Herero and Namaqua Genocide

The Herero and Namaqua Genocide is considered to have been the first genocide of the 20th century. It took place between 1904 and 1907 in German South-West Africa (modern day Namibia), during the scramble for Africa.
On January 12, 1904, the Herero people, led by Samuel Maharero, rebelled against German colonial rule. In August, German general Lothar von Trotha defeated the Herero in the Battle of Waterberg and drove them into the desert of Omaheke, where most of them died of thirst. In October, the Nama people also rebelled against the Germans only to suffer a similar fate.
In total, from 24,000 up to 100,000 Herero and 10,000 Nama died. The genocide was characterized by widespread death by starvation and thirst because the Herero who fled the violence were prevented from returning from the Namib Desert. Some sources also claim that the German colonial army systematically poisoned desert wells.
In 1985, the United Nations' Whitaker Report classified the aftermath as an attempt to exterminate the Herero and Nama peoples of South-West Africa, and therefore one of the earliest attempts at genocide in the 20th century. The German government recognized and apologized for the events in 2004, but has ruled out financial compensation for the victims' descendants.

Huronian glaciation

The Huronian glaciation (or Makganyene glaciation) lasted from 2400 million years ago (mya) to 2100 mya, during the Palaeoproterozoic era. It was named after evidence was collected from Lake Huron region in North America. There, three separate horizons of glacial deposits are separated by non-glacial sediment.
It was one of the most severe and longest ice ages in geologic history, similar to the Snowball Earth ice ages that happened in the Neoproterozoic era. 
The glaciations were probably triggered by the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE), which removed atmospheric methane (a greenhouse gas), and eventually supplied free oxygen to the atmosphere. The alternate warm and ice age periods was probably caused by a repeating cycle. Cyanobacteria flourished in the warm periods, producing huge amounts of oxygen. The oxygen removed the free methane, and used up carbon dioxide. This caused the temperature to crash. This slowed down the bacteria. So the temperature rose again...
However, it is also possible that there was a 250 million year lull in volcanic activity, resulting in lower carbon dioxide levels and so reduced greenhouse effect.

Wax tablet

A wax tablet is what the Roman schools used instead of paper. They used a stylus to write with. The wax melted when warm, but was quite smooth when it set. Wax tablets could also be used for messages, but ink on wood was more permanent (see Vindolanda). The Romans also used ink on manuscripts, and could stitch the manuscripts together to make a codex.
The earliest surviving example of a writing tablet dates to the later Bronze Age, 1400 BC. A boxwood writing tablet with an ivory hinge was found in 1986, in the remains of a shipwreck, the Uluburun Shipwreck, near Kaş, Turkey.

Noah Webster

Noah Webster, Jr. (October 16, 1758 – May 28, 1843), was the author of a famous American dictionary, a pioneer of spelling, and a political writer and editor. His "Blue-backed Speller" books taught five generations of American children how to spell and read. His dictionary was first published in 1828 as "An American Dictionary of the English Language".
Webster worried that his "Grammatical Institute" might be pirated. He had to seek copyright protection from each state. At last, on May 31, 1790, President George Washington signed the United States’ first general copyright act into law. Later, Webster lobbied for an extended copyright law. He wrote “By this bill the term of copy-right is secured for 28 years, with the right of renewal … for 14 years more. If this should become law, I shall be much benefited.” The new federal copyright law was passed and remained in effect until 1909.
385 'editions' (mostly reprints) in his lifetime; by 1837 15 million copies sold; by 1890 60 million copies sold.

Eir

In Norse mythology, Eir "(«help»,«grace»,«mercy»,«protection»,«calm».)" is the goddess associated with healing. She is known to be one of the handmaidens of Frigg, who is wife of Odin, the king of the gods.
Eir is the healer of the other gods and goddesses. If they were ever sick or injured; Eir would heal and protect them. One of the things Eir uses to heal people is ritual involving a white tanned flower (called the "Eirflower" for this reason). She would only use this ritual if she really needed to.
It was common to light a red or green candle for Eir when praying for healing.Eir was frequently known for devouring cows whole, She also often ate goats too.
Eir is a physician Goddess mentioned by Snorri Sturluson in the Younger (Poetic) Edda. This is basically all that survives about Eir. Her name means "copper" or "brass" and is cognate with the English word "ore." In light of this, the forge and metalwork aspects Eleiren has seen, while not in surviving lore. Medicine in Norse culture was evidently considered mostly a job done by women.
Basic traits:
Appearance: Slender with reddish-blond hair, clear blue eyes, & pale skin. Unclothed, her arms show an amazingly muscular build. She usually wears a red or gray gown with a blue hooded cloak that is fastened over her chest with a red brooch shaped like a tree. She is approximately 5'9" - 5'11"
She is a forge goddess who deals more with creative and artistic aspects, than with making weapons & the like, though she seems to be fairly skilled at both.

Winghead shark

The winghead shark ("Eusphyra blochii") is a species of Hammerhead shark. This shark gets its name from the wide lobes on its head. It is the only member in the genus "Eusphyra". It is a small and harmless species, and is fished throughout its range.
Like all other Hammerhead sharks, the winghead shark has a "hammer" on its head known as the "cephalofoil". The winghead shark's cephalofoil is very long and thin, making it different from other Hammerhead sharks. The width of its cephalofoil is 40 to 50% of the body length. The cephalofoil is arrow-shaped from above, and has small bumps in front of the nostrils. Unlike other Hammerhead sharks the nostrils are closer to the centre of the cephalofoil than the ends. The winghead shark is normally grey, greyish-brown or light brown in colour. It is a small shark, usually growing up to the length of 130 cm (51 inches), but the longest ever found was 186 cm (73 in) long.
The winghead shark is found in shallow waters on the continental shelves of the Western Indo-Pacific, from the Persian Gulf to the Philippines, north to China and Taiwan, and south to Queensland and the Northern Territory of Australia. The winghead shark sometimes enters the brackish water of estuaries.
The winghead shark feeds on bony fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods like squid, octopus and cuttlefish.
Like most other Hammerhead sharks, the winghead shark is viviparous.

Scalloped hammerhead

The scalloped hammerhead ("Sphyrna lewini") is a species of hammerhead shark. It was first known as "zygaena lewini", but is now known as "Sphyrna lewini". The word "Sphyrna" is a Greek word meaning "hammer", which refers to the "hammer" or "cephalofoil" on its head.
It is also known as the "bronze hammerhead", the "kidney-headed hammerhead", or the "southern hammerhead". It is found in warm temperate and tropical coastal waters all around the world, between latitudes 46° N and 36° S. It is the most common Hammerhead shark.
Like all other hammerhead sharks, the scalloped hammerhead has a "hammer", which is known as the "cephalofoil", on its head. The shark's eyes and nostrils are placed on the ends of the cephalofoil. Scalloped hammerheads usually grow to the length of 1.5 to 2.7 meters long, but the longest found was 4.3 meters long. The heaviest ever found weighed 150 kilograms. They are usually olive, bronze, light brown, grey-brown or even silver-grey in colour with a white belly. The edges of the fins are usually darker on the young, but as they grow older they become more lighter.
The scalloped hammerhead was first known as "Zygaena lewini". It was renamed "Sphyrna lewini" in 1834. It has also been known as "Cestracion leeuwenii" in 1865, "Zygaena erythraea" in 1871, "Cestracion oceanica" in 1913, and "Sphyrna diplana" in 1941. The word "Sphyrna" is a Greek word meaning "hammer". It refers to the shape of the shark's head.
The scalloped hammerhead is a coastal pelagic species. It is found in continental and insular shelves, and in nearby deeper water. It is found in warm temperate and tropical coastal waters all around the world, between latitudes 46° north and 36° south. It can be found down to depths of over 500 metres (1,600 ft) but is mostly found above 25 metres (82 ft).
During the daytime, they are usually found close to shore. At night, they hunt further from the shore. Adults are usually found alone, in pairs or in small groups, The young are found in larger groups of up to one hundred or even more members. Although scalloped hammerheads are said to be harmless towards humans, there has been reports of attacks from this shark. These attacks could be caused from the great hammerhead shark.
Scalloped hammerheads feed on fish such as sardines, mackerel, and herring. They sometimes eat cephalopods like octopuses and squids. They have also been known to eat other smaller species of sharks like the Blacktip reef shark, "Carcharhinus melanopterus", and the Atlantic sharpnose shark, "(Rhizoprionodon terraenovae)".
Scalloped hammerheads are viviparous. Females are pregnant for 9 to 10 months before giving birth to 15 to 30 pups. Young ones grow slowly compared to other sharks. They also have darker fins than adults.
In 2008, the scalloped hammerhead was placed on the "globally endangered" list. Research has shown that in some parts of the Atlantic Ocean, populations have decreased by 95% in the last 30 years. The reason for this is because of over-fishing for shark fins. Their fins are made into shark fin soup. Researchers are calling for a ban on Shark finning, which is when the fin's of sharks are cut off and the rest of the animal is thrown back into the water to die. Hammerhead sharks are the most commonly caught sharks for finning.

Hyder Ali (, , "Haidarālī"; , "Haidar Alī"; c. 1720 – 7 December 1782, 2 Muharram 1197 in the Islamic calendar) was the "de facto" ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore in southern India. Born Hyder Naik, he distinguished himself militarily, eventually drawing the attention of Mysore's rulers. Rising to the post of "dalwai", or commander-in-chief to Krishnaraja Wodeyar II, he came to dominate the titular monarch and the Mysore government, and eventually seized control of all of the reins of power. He expanded the kingdom's borders at the expense of the Maratha Empire and Nizam of Hyderabad (among others), and was one of the few local rulers to effectively blunt the military advances of the British East India Company during two wars. In the First and Second Anglo-Mysore Wars he came within striking distance of the British outpost at Madras. He was given a number of honorific titles, and was referred to as Sultan Hyder Ali Khan or Hyder Ali Sahib.
Hyder's rule of Mysore was characterised by frequent warfare with his neighbours and rebellion within his territories. This was not unusual for the time, as much of the Indian subcontinent was then in turmoil, with the Hindu Maratha Confederacy struggling with the remnants of the Muslim Mughal Empire. He was a shrewd leader, and left his son Tipu Sultan a kingdom that was significantly larger than when he first took it over. He organised his military in part along European lines, and was a pioneer in the military use of rocket artillery. He had at least two wives, and fathered at least three children.

The Mansion of Happiness

The Mansion of Happiness is a 19th-century board game for children. It was designed by clergyman's daughter and children's author Anne Abbott. The game was published by W. & S. B. Ives in 1843. Parker Brothers republished the game in 1894. The firm claimed the game was the first board game published in America, but this claim is disputed. It was however the first mass-produced board game in America.
The game is didacticit is both entertaining and instructive. The theme of the game is Christian virtue. Players race about a track of 66 spaces. "The Mansion of Happiness" (Heaven, the center space) is their goal. Landing on a space marked with a vice (such as dishonesty) will send the player back several spaces and away from the goal. Spaces marked with virtues (such as honesty) send players forward and closer to the goal. The winner is the player who reaches the center space first.
Like many Christian-themed games of the middle 19th-century, "The Mansion of Happiness" lost some of its popularity in the last decades of the 19th century. It was then that games with secular and materialistic themes such as Milton Bradley's "The Checkered Game of Life" rose in demand. In literature, "The Mansion of Happiness" is mentioned in the boys' book "Shifting for Himself; or, Gilbert Greyson's Fortunes" (1876) by Horatio Alger, Jr. In this story, the title hero plays the game with friends Laura and Fred Vivian to while away the evening hours. In 2012 the game board was available on-line in a color reprint of the original.

Smalleye hammerhead shark

The smalleye hammerhead shark ("Sphyrna tudes"), also known as the "golden hammerhead" or the "curry shark", is a small species in the hammerhead shark group, and is found in the shallow coastal waters of the western Atlantic Ocean from Venezuela to Uruguay. It likes to live in muddy habitats. Like all other hammerhead sharks, the smalleye hammerhead shark has a "hammer" (also known as the "cephalofoil") on its head.
The smalleye hammerhead shark is a small member of the hammerhead shark group, reaching up to the length of 1.5 meters (4.9 ft) long, but ones which are 1.2-1.3 meters (3.9-4.3 ft) long are more common. They weigh around 9 kg. The cephalofoil is wide and long, measuring up to 28-32% of the body length. The eyes, which are placed at the ends of the cephalofoil, are smaller than the eyes of other hammerhead sharks and have a third eyelid. The nostrils are placed inside the eyes.
Young smalleye hammerhead sharks are grey on the top and are white below. When they reach the length of 45 cm (18 in) their undersides start turning yellow, which turns to orange when they are 50 cm (20 in) long. The golden colour then comes when they are 55–70 cm (22–28 in) long, but fades when they become mature.
The smalleye hammerhead shark is found along the eastern coast of South America, from Uruguay to Venezuela, but it is sometimes found further west than the Orinoco Delta southeast of Trinidad. They have been unconfirmed reports of this shark being found off Panama, Mexico, and western Florida. It is the most common shark of where it lives. The smalleye hammerhead shark also is found in inshore murky waters which are 5-40 meters (16-130 ft) deep. Newborns and young ones which are under 40 cm (16 in) long, are found in the shallowest waters, and move deeper as they grow older. Adult females are mostly found in water which is 9-18 meters (30-59 ft) deep, while adult males are mostly found at the depths of 27-36 meters (89–118 ft).
There are four other species of hammerhead sharks which live in the same area as the smalleye hammerhead shark lives: the scoophead, the bonnethead, the great hammerhead shark and the scalloped hammerhead shark. There is little competition between these sharks because of their different habitats and eating. Adult males and young ones of both genders come together and form groups, although these groups to not seem to be made for reproduction or migration. Adult females seem to live alone.
Young smalleye hammerhead sharks which are under the length of 67 cm (26 inches) feed mostly on penaeid shrimp, while larger ones feed mainly on bony fish, especially ariid sea catfish and their eggs. The shrimp and the surface mucus layer and eggs of the catfish contain carotenoid pigments which seem to cause the golden colour of the shark. Another shark which lives in the same area as the smalleye hammerhead shark, the Yellow smooth-hound ("Mustelus higmani"), also feeds on shrimp and has a yellowish colour on it, but it is not as bright as the colour on the smalleye hammerhead shark. The smalleye hammerhead shark is also known to eat swimming crabs, squid, and newborn scalloped hammerhead sharks.
The smalleye hammerhead shark has been known to be eaten by larger sharks such as the bull shark ("Carcharhinus leucas"), and sometimes it has been eaten by bony fishes.
Like most other hammerhead sharks, the smalleye hammerhead shark is viviparous, meaning that it gives live birth. They mate in August and September and females are pregnant for around 10 months before giving birth to 5-12 pups in May and June. Males and females mature when they are 80 to 98 cm (31 to 39 inches) long. But male smalleye hammerhead sharks found off the northern Brazilian state of Maranhão mature when they are 92 cm (36 cm) long, while females mature when they are over 101 cm (40 in) long.
Shy and harmless towards humans, smalleye hammerhead sharks are fished throughout its range and is sold as food. Overfishing has now caused populations of the smalleye hammerhead shark to decrease. This has led the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to list it under Vulnerable.

National Portrait Gallery, London

The National Portrait Gallery (NPG) is an art gallery in London. It holds a collection of portraits of historically important and famous British people. It was the first portrait gallery in the world when it opened in 1856. 
The gallery moved in 1896 to its current site at St Martin's Place, off Trafalgar Square, next to the National Gallery. It has been expanded twice since then. The National Portrait Gallery also has three regional outposts. It is not connected to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. The NPG is a quango sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.
The gallery houses portraits of historically important and famous British people, selected on the basis of the significance of the sitter, not that of the artist. The collection includes photographs and caricatures as well as paintings, drawings and sculpture. 
One of its best-known images is the 'Chandos portrait', the most famous portrait of William Shakespeare although there is some uncertainty about whether the painting actually is of the playwright.
Not all of the portraits are exceptional artistically, although there are self-portraits by William Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds and other British artists of note. Some, such as the group portrait of the participants in the Somerset House Conference of 1604, are important historical documents in their own right. Often, the curiosity value is greater than the artistic worth of a work, as in the case of the portrait of Edward VI by William Scrots, Patrick Brontë's painting of his sisters Charlotte, Emily and Anne, or a sculpture of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in medieval costume. Portraits of living figures were allowed from 1969. 
In addition to its permanent galleries of historical portraits, the National Portrait Gallery exhibits a rapidly changing collection of contemporary work, stages exhibitions of portrait art by individual artists and hosts the annual BP Portrait Prize competition.
The Gallery has many portrait busts by sculptors. The sculptors are mostly British or resident in Britain, and the subjects are British. Sculptors include poineers of modern sculpture such as Sir Jacob Epstein (14 examples), Dame Elizabeth Frink (5 examples), Sir Eduardo Paolozzi (four self-portrait busts).

Daydreaming is a short-term detachment from one's immediate surroundings. During a daydream, a person's contact with reality is blurred. External reality is second to a visionary fantasy. 
There are many types of daydreams, and there is no agreed definition. However, the characteristic that is common to all forms of daydreaming is a mild separation from the person's surroundings. Daydreams are under conscious control, so they differ from dreams, but they do have a kind of dream-like fantasy quality. Although daydreaming in children may be frowned upon by parents and teachers, it seems quite normal. There is evidence which suggests daydreaming is associated with mental health and stability.

Carlos Juan Finlay (December 3, 1833 – August 20, 1915) was a Cuban physician and scientist who started the interest in yellow fever research.
Finlay was born Juan Carlos Finlay y Barres, in Puerto Príncipe (now Camagüey), Cuba. His family is of French and Scottish heritage. In 1853 he went to Jefferson Medical college in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He graduated in 1855. He finished his studies in Havana and in Paris. Later he moved to Havana and started a medical practice.
Finlay continued his work in the 1870s. He was the first to come up with the idea that a mosquito was a carrier for a disease that causes yellow fever. He discovered that the spread and cause of yellow fever was from a mosquito. The mosquito would bite a person with the disease and would then bite and infect a healthy person. A year later Finlay identified the mosquito of the genus Aedes as the insect transmitting yellow fever. His research led to the control of the mosquito population as a way to control the spread of the disease.
Dr. Finlay was a member of Havana's Royal Academy of Medical, Physical and Natural Sciences. He was fluent in French, German, Spanish, and English, and could read Latin. He was interested in a lot of things but his main interest was yellow fever. He wrote 40 articles on this disease. His theory was that an intermediary host was responsible for the spread of the disease. As a result of his work, Dr. Finlay was nominated seven times for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, but it was never awarded to him. He received the National Order of the Legion of Honour of France in 1908.
In 1990, the Walter Reed Commission confirmed what Carlos found. Reed was known to all as being the one that discovered the connection of yellow fever and the mosquito but he gave the credit to Finlay. He used Finlay's information to help with his research. Soon Finlay became the chief health officer of Cuba from 1902-1909. 
Finlay died from heart failure caused by pneumonia in his home in Havana, Cuba.

Al-Fatiha Foundation

The Al-Fatiha Foundation is an organization which advances the cause of gay, lesbian, and transgender Muslims. It was founded in 1997 by Faisal Alam, a Pakistani American, and is registered as a nonprofit organization in the United States. Imam Daayiee Abdullah is also a board member of the Al-Fatiha Foundation.
The organization grew out of an internet listserve that brought together many gay, lesbian, and questioning Muslims from 25 countries, and by 1998 had developed numerous in-person chapters. Al-Fatiha has 14 chapters in the United States, as well as offices in England, Canada, Spain, Turkey, and South Africa.
The name means "the Opening" and is shared with Al-Fatiha or the first surah of the Qur'an. In the beginning of that surah, Allah is described as compassionate and merciful; the organization's founders believe that these attributes characterize Islam, rather than hatred and homophobia.
Each year, Al-Fatiha hosts an international membership retreat and conference. Early conferences took place in Boston, New York, and London in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and focused on issues such as the reconciliation of religion and sexual orientation.

Aluminum wiring

Aluminum wiring is electrical wiring made of aluminum, instead of the usual copper. It is widely and successfully used for electricity transmission and distribution. It is lighter and stronger than copper wire, which helps prevent the cables from sagging. It is also less expensive than copper wire. It has also been successfully used in aircraft wiring. In the 1960s, with the rising price of copper, electricians started to use it to wire homes and other buildings. Aluminum wiring was not successful in this application and it is a major safety problem. Because of the safety problems with aluminum wiring, it was discontinued for building wiring in the mid-1970s. Over time, aluminum wiring can separate from the screws on electrical outlets, switches, or lights, creating a poor connection, which causes the wire to heat up. The heat can cause the aluminum to oxidize, creating an even worse connection and more heat, which can eventually start a fire. Incorrect repairs to aluminum wiring, such as connecting aluminum wire to copper wire with twist-on wire connectors, can make the problem even worse. Even twist-on connectors designed to connect aluminum to copper can be dangerous. The only proper way to repair aluminum wiring is to connect it to copper "tails" (short pieces of copper wire) with crimped or screw-on connectors specifically designed for this purpose.

A settler is a person who has migrated to an area and made a permanent home there. Many times the reason is to colonize the area.
Many times in history settlers live on land which used to belong to people who had lived there a long time. These people are known as indigenous people. Other names are natives, Aborigines or, in the Americas, Indians. This land is usually settled against the wishes of the indigenes. It is then controlled, defended and grown by force.

Wikipedia:Competence is required

Wikipedia is a big place, with many editors, all with their own opinions on how to do things. It may seem surprising that we'd be able to work together, but somehow this is what usually happens.
One of our important guidelines that reminds editors to work together is "". This is good advice, because it tells us that when we disagree, usually everyone involved is trying to do what they really think is best. Sure, we get sometimes, but they're usually easy to deal with. They can be blocked from editing, if needed, with little trouble and often without more arguments.
We often see bigger disputes where editors are disruptive while trying to help. This can cause harm to our ideas of assuming good faith. Some editors focus on "good faith" so much, that they might think that is all you need to take part here. But that isn't quite true. Competence is required also; that is, editors need to understand what they are writing about.
Every editor is incompetent in some areas, so it is good to be aware of what you can and cannot do well.
We can normally assume that people are "trying" to help, just like we assume they breathe air. But if someone is "unable" to help, or is sometimes helpful, but sometimes causes major disruption, this is a bad thing that must not be allowed to continue. The proverbial bull in a china shop might have good intentions, but he's clearly bad for business. We must always value the project as a whole more than we value the contributions of any one editor.
So, the next time someone posts on a noticeboard saying "Editor is causing problems—here's the diffs to demonstrate this," or "Disruptive editor is asking for an unblock," think twice before just saying "Assume good faith." The person making the complaint is probably already assuming good faith, and they're talking about a lack of competence, not a lack of good faith. Both are needed to edit usefully. If an editor has "already shown" incompetence that causes disruption, no amount of good faith fixes this problem.
The best good will is useless without basic understanding of the facts, as seen by most of the people they involve.
Some people just can't work well with others. We can't change Wikipedia enough to suit them, so if they don't change themselves, they need to be shown the door. 
Editors with disabilities that affect behavior or those that suffer certain mental health issues sometimes fall into this category. This isn't an anti-disability statement, but an explanation that these are not acceptable excuses for poor interaction.
Some people have very strong personal opinions which affects their judgement when or . If this continues to be disruptive, a 'topic ban' can be better than banning the editor from the entire website, because some people can still make valuable contributions in places "other" than the disrupted topic. Also keep in mind that for some reason, it is often harder to see your own biased editing, than it is to see someone else's biased editing.
If someone can't write English well, and can't discuss things with other editors very well, consider trying to get them to edit a Wikipedia in their own language. Those other-language Wikipedias need help from editors, too.
Some people are not mature enough to edit Wikipedia. This means either they are just too young, or they act like it.
Some people don't understand everything about how Wikipedia works. They may still be able to do some easy jobs, but they'll probably run into trouble if they try doing something more complicated.
This is not usually an issue, except when editors delve into areas needing technical skills. Not everyone needs the same skill set—and if editors stick to skills they can handle, there is never a problem.
Some people get so upset over a past dispute, they continue to believe that "So-and-so is a bad editor and is out to get me." . An enforced sentence of "don't interact with this other editor" may be something to try for solving these cases.
We all started here as new editors not knowing as much about the project as we do now. That is not so bad, because it is easy to fix. Help the newer editors understand what we do here and how we work, so they can soon make themselves useful.
In the end, it doesn't matter much whether someone's disruption is due to mischief or incompetence. Don't waste much time trying to figure out which one it is, because many trolls do their trolling by feigning incompetence. There's no point trying to distinguish between fake or real incompetence—disruption is disruption, and needs to be prevented. Give editors a few chances, and some good advice — but if these don't lead to reasonably competent editing within a reasonable timeframe, it's best to wash your hands of the situation. Not every person belongs at Wikipedia, because some people are not competent enough.
... is often criticized for . In its defense, we may point out that the main reason for it is not to tell someone they are too stupid to edit Wikipedia. If that is truly the case, pointing them here will probably not improve the situation. Instead, this essay is to give the competent editors advice on how to handle problems coming from incompetence. It is best not to link the incompetent editor to this page.

Martin Frobisher

Sir Martin Frobisher (1535 or 1539 – 15 November 1594) was an English seaman who made three voyages to the New World to look for the Northwest Passage. All landed in northeastern Canada, around today's Resolution Island and Frobisher Bay.
On his second voyage, Frobisher found what he thought was gold ore and carried 200 tons of it home on three ships, where initial assaying determined it to be worth a profit of £5.1 per ton. Encouraged, Frobisher returned to Canada with an even larger fleet and dug several mines around Frobisher Bay. He carted 1,350 tons of the ore back where, after years of smelting, it was realized that both that batch of ore and the earlier one he had taken were worthless iron pyrite. As an English privateer/pirate, he collected riches from French ships. He was later knighted for his service in repelling the Spanish Armada in 1588.

Edward J. Smith

Edward John "E. J." Smith (27 January 1850 – 15 April 1912) was an English sea captain. He was the captain of the R.M.S Titanic, which sank when it struck an iceberg. Smith was to retire after the maiden voyage of the Titanic, but he died when the ship sank. 
Smith was born on 27 January 1850 in Hanley, Staffordshire, England. He was married to Sarah Eleanor Pennington from 1887 until his death in 1912. They had one daughter.
When the "Titanic" struck the iceberg, Smith knew within minutes that the ship was doomed and that people would die. During the evacuation, Captain Smith did all in his power to prevent panic and did his best to assist in the evacuation; Major Arthur Godfrey Peuchen of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club said "He was doing everything in his power to get women in these boats, and to see that they were lowered properly. I thought he was doing his duty in regard to the lowering of the boats". Robert Williams Daniel, a first class passenger also said:
Just minutes before the ship started its final plunge, Smith was still busy releasing "Titanic"'s crew from their duties; he went to the Marconi operators room and released Junior Marconi Officer Harold Bride and senior wireless operator John "Jack" Phillips from their duties. He then carried out a final tour of the deck, telling crew members: "Now it's every man for himself." Steward Edward Brown saw the captain approach with a megaphone in his hand. He heard him say "Well boys, do your best for the women and children, and look out for yourselves.” He saw the Captain walk onto the bridge alone just seconds before the ship took its final plunge. This was the last reliable sighting of Smith. Just seconds later Trimmer Samuel Hemming found the bridge apparently empty.
Smith died that night along with around 1,500 others, and his body was never recovered. 
There are conflicting accounts of his death; Some claimed to have seen Smith in the water swimming towards a lifeboat, or near the capsized collapsible lifeboat "B", others claimed saw shooting himself with a pistol. Other accounts describe him entered the wheelhouse on the bridge and died there when it was engulfed. The actual fate of captain Smith will probably remain uncertain. His body was never recovered.
Smith has been played by many actors during documentaries, movies, television series, or plays. The most well known actors to play Smith are George C. Scott and Bernard Hill.

Archibald Gracie IV

Colonel Archibald Gracie IV (January 17, 1859 – December 4, 1912) was an American writer, amateur historian, real estate investor, and survivor of the sinking of the R.M.S Titanic. He survived the sinking by climbing aboard an overturned lifeboat. He wrote a popular book about the disaster which is still in print today.
Gracie was born on January 17, 1959 in Mobile, Alabama and studied at St. Paul's School. He was never married.
Gracie was saved during the sinking of the Titanic when he got onto a lifeboat. Then as the ship started to sink, his life boat was sucked underwater. Gracie and his friend Clinch Smith were under the ship when Gracie was freed from the ship's current and began to swin towards a collapsed lifeboat. His friend Clinch never reached the surface and his remains were never found.
Gracie died on December 4, 1912 from diabetes in New York City, New York, aged 53. He died just 8 months after the sinking, making him the first upper class Titanic survivor to die. Gracie's last words were "We must get them into the boats. We must get them all into the boats."

, also known as or "Battleship Island", is a 1.2-km Japanese island. It is one of 505 uninhabited islands in Nagasaki Prefecture on the island of Kyushu.

Hashima is a former coal mining site. People lived on the island from 1887 until 1974.
In 1890, Mitsubishi bought the inhabited island to mine coal from undersea tunnels. The company built Japan's first large concrete building. It was nine stories.
This Hashima Island is also known as "The Prison island" or "The island of the Hell", because many teenagers from South Korea forced to work at mines in Hashima Island. When those miners arrived there without knowing that they won't be able to see their homes again, majority of them were 13 years old to 15 years old. They had work under in such a terrible conditions: wearing only under wear to go in the mine also, they never got paid for their work and for their meals, they had to eat the left overs from making bean oil. Only two out of over a hundred of the young workers survived. They said "I could here my friend yelling that they are hungry all the time." and "I want to eat a bowl of rice grown in my country with a bowl of warm soup". These survivors described Hashima Island as "a prison that I am forced to stay without frames" Also, Japan has rapidly said that the young miners volunteered to come so it is not considered as "forced to work". However, the two survivors does not agree with that. Behind the this island of Hashima there is sad truth.
Since 2005, the island has been part of the city of Nagasaki.
Hashima island is near the mouth of Nagasaki harbour. It is about 19 miles from the center of the city.
The island is one of the locations in the 2012 James Bond film "Skyfall".

Benkei or Saitō no Musashibō Benkei (1155–1189) was a warrior monk ("sōhei") who served Minamoto no Yoshitsune. He is shown as a man of great strength and loyalty, in Japanese folklore. He became a monk at an early age. At seventeen, he was over two metres (6.6 feet) tall. Benkei was trained in the naginata or the Japanese halberd.
In a battle at Gojō Bridge in Kyoto, he defeated every warrior who was passing by, and collected their 999 swords. On his 1000th duel, Benkei was defeated by Minamoto no Yoshitsune. He became a retainer of Yoshitsune and fought with him in the Genpei War against the Taira clan. People say it is because of him that the Minamoto clan had successes. In the end, however, both Yoshitsune and Benkei were surrounded in the castle of . Yoshitsune went deeper inside the castle keep to commit suicide (seppuku) according to the samurai tradition, while Benkei fought on at the bridge in front of the main gate to protect Yoshitsune. He killed more than of 300 fully trained soldiers. Long before the battle should have been over the hesitant soldiers noticed that Benkei was shot with many arrows, and having many wounds, was standing still. The soldiers dared to investigate, but the giant fell to the ground, because he died while still standing. This is known as the "Standing Death of Benkei" (弁慶の立往生, Benkei no Tachi Ōjō among the Japanese).

Pegomastax

Pegomastax ("strong jaw") is a genus of small heterodontosaur dinosaur discovered in Lower Jurassic rocks in South Africa. It is based on a skull in the Iziko South African Museum in Cape Town. 
It was collected during a 1966–1967 expedition but not named and described until recently. Paul Sereno, who had recognized it as unusual in the 1980s, published a description in 2012. The type species is "P. africana". "Pegomastax" differed from other heterodontosaurs by details of the skull. The lower jaw was robust, with a short beak. Like most other heterodontosaurs, "Pegomastax" had an enlarged canine-like tooth at the beginning of the lower jaw's tooth row, which may have been used for defence. The rest of its teeth were those of a herbivore.

Dom Justo Takayama

Dom Justo Takayama (1552–4 February 1615), also known as , was a Japanese samurai and daimyo. He was a Christian at a time when the religion was not permitted in Japan. 
Toyotomi Hideyoshi persecuted Christianity and, in 1587, he made all missionaries and Christians leave Japan. While many daimyo obeyed this order and rejected Catholicism, Justo proclaimed that he would maintain his religion and rather give up his land and property. Justo lived under the protection of his friends for several decades, but following the 1614 prohibition of Christianity by Tokugawa Ieyasu, the ruler of the time, he was made to leave Japan. 
On November 8, 1614, together with 300 Japanese Christians he left his home country from Nagasaki. He arrived at Manila on December 21 and was greeted warmly by the Spanish Jesuits and the local Filipinos there. He settled in Plaza Dilao, Paco together with more than 3,000 Japanese who aleady liveed there. 
When Takayama died in 1615, the Spanish government buried him with a Christian burial with full military honors as a Daimyo. He is the first Daimyo to be
buried in Philippine soil.
There is a statue of Dom Justo Takayama in Plaza Dilao, Manila. Today there is a statue of Justo with a sword and a figure of a crucified Jesus. 
In 1994, the Diocese of Tokyo formally petitioned the Vatican to look into whether Takayama should be recognized as a saint.

Muir felt that the national parks and forests needed to be preserved and some resources which should be off-limits to industrial use. His activism helped to preserve the Yosemite Valley, Sequoia National Park and other wilderness areas all over the United States. The Sierra Club, which he founded, is now one of the most important conservation organizations in the United States. 
One of the most well-known hiking trails in the U.S., the John Muir Trail, was named in his honor. Other places named in his honor are Muir Woods National Monument, Muir Beach, John Muir College, Mount Muir, Camp Muir and Muir Glacier. For his outstanding accomplishments in preserving America's environment, he is known to many as the "Father of the National Parks".

Unmanned aerial vehicle

An unmanned aerial vehicle (often called a drone) is an aircraft that is not operated by a pilot on board. 
Drones may have an onboard computer to take care of adjustments to wind and changes in air pressure. Sometimes they are programmed to a particular target. Important decisions are usually supervised by people on the ground. 
Large UAVs are mostly used by military forces, for example for reconnaissance or unmanned combat. Some of them are programmed to be a target, or to be shot at. In addition, drones also have civilian uses, such as firefighting or taking photographs.
Drones come in different sizes. Wingspans range from a few centimetres to about , the size of regular, manned aircraft.

Dog fighting

Dog fighting is a blood sport that involves several dogs fighting at one time; sometimes many dogs are involved. The practice of dog fighting goes back to the ancient times. Dog fighting is forbidden in Australia, the United States and Canada. All fifty U.S. States classify dog fighting as a felony and attending a dog fight is not allowed in many US States.
In dog fighting breeds, "gameness" is valued as it gives the dog the ability to maintain the attack in baiting, despite ripped flesh, dehydration, exhaustion or broken bones. As one writer describes it, "Game is the dog that won't quit fighting, the dog that'll die in the ring, the dog that'll fight with two broken legs." Training of a game dog varies depending on the level and experience of the dog-fighter. A famous American "gamebred" breed of dog is the American Pit Bull Terrier. A famous Irish "gamebred" breed of dog is the Kerry Blue Terrier. A famous English "gamebred" breed of dog is the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. A famous Japanese "gamebred" breed of dog is the Tosa Inu. A famous Argentinian "gamebred" breed of dog is the Dogo Argentino.

Cellulitis is caused by bacteria, usually staphylococcus or streptococcus, which can get through a break in the skin. These breaks can be caused by a wound, cracks in the skin, insect bites, or problems with the bodies immune system. The infection causes the skin to become red, hot and painful. It can also cause a fever. Treatment is usually by taking antibiotic drugs.

Metalloprotein

A metalloprotein is a protein that contains a metal ion cofactor. A large fraction of all proteins are members of this category, so the number is very large.
It is estimated that about half of all proteins contain a metal. In another estimate, about one quarter to one third of all proteins are need metals to carry out their functions. Thus, metalloproteins have many different functions in cells, such as enzymes, transport and storage proteins, and signal transduction proteins.

Haem

A haem (British English) (or heme (American English) is a type of co-factor. It is an iron ion in the center of a large organic ring called a "porphyrin". 
Not all porphyrins contain iron, but many porphyrin-containing metalloproteins have haem as their co-factor; these are known as haemoproteins. Haems are components of haemoglobin, the red pigment in blood. They are also components of a number of other haemoproteins.

Pernicious anemia

Pernicious anemia is a medical problem that causes a person to have too few red blood cells (anemia) because their intestines cannot absorb vitamin B12 properly. A special protein, called intrinsic factor, helps the body get vitamin B12 from food such as meat, poultry and dairy foods. Intrinsic factor is made by cells in the stomach. If there is not enough intrinsic factor, the small intestine is unable to get the vitamin B12.
There are several causes of pernicious anemia. These include a weakened stomach lining or a problem with the body's immune system, which causes it to attack the intrinsic factor. In some rare cases it can be passed down through families. Treatment is usually a regular injection of vitamin B12.
Intrinsic factor was discovered by Thomas Addison.

Emperor Antoku

There was a battle by an inland sea (Dan No Ura) on April 24th 1185, between two powerful Japanese clans .( The ruling Hekei and another clan called Genji) Each asserted a superior claim to the throne . The Hekei were badly outnumbered and out manoeuvered. Antoku`s guardian was his grandmother,( lady Ni) When it became clear the Hekei had lost the battle, the boy emperor`s grandmother resolved not to be caught by the enemy alive. " Where are you to take me?" asked the boy emperor. Blinded by tears, the child emperor recited a Buddah prayer, then prayed to the east, then to the west to say farewell to the Buddah. Lady Ni took him in her arms, and with the words: " In the depths of the ocean is our capital." They jumped together into the sea and drowned. Then followed a frenzied mass suicide by the remaining Hekei forces. Only 43 Hekei survived, all women in waiting. They were reduced to selling flowers and other favours to the local fisher folk. Each year on April 24th a ceremony is held, at a shrine near the scene of the battle, to commemorate the child emperor`s short life.
Before he became the monarch, his personal name ("imina") was . or Kotohito"-shinnō".
He was the son of Emperor Takakura.
Antoku was named Crown Prince at around one month of age. He became emperor at one year of age.
The Taira were defeated; and Antoku died in the sea after the naval battle was lost. Antoku's grandmother drowned herself by jumping into the sea with the young emperor in her arms.
The story of Emperor Antoku and his mother's family is told in "The Tale of the Heike".

The Little Mermaid (1989 movie)

The Little Mermaid is a 1989 American animated musical fantasy movie produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation. It is based on the fairy tale of the same name.
The movie was first released into movie theaters on November 14, 1989 by Walt Disney Pictures and Buena Vista Pictures. It was re-released on November 17, 1997. Disney said that there would be a 3D re-release on September 13, 2013. This was cancelled on January 14, 2013 because the other Disney 3D re-releases were not as successful as Disney had hoped they would be. 
In January 1990, "The Little Mermaid" had three Academy Award nominations. The movie won two of the awards. They were for Best Song ("Under the Sea") and Best Score. The movie also earned four Golden Globe nominations. It won the awards for Best Song ("Under the Sea") and Best Score.
The movie is about a mermaid princess named Ariel. She and her best friend, a fish named Flounder, explore the ocean looking for human things. They talk to a seagull named Scuttle who explains each thing that they find (but not accurately). Ariel does not like living in the sea and wants to live on land, where people are. One day she sees a ship of people and meets a prince named Eric. She saves his life from drowning. When Ariel's father, King Triton, finds out that she saved a human man from drowning, he destroys all the things she has kept in her grotto. After that, two eels named Flotsam and Jetsam tell her about a seawitch named Ursula. They tell her that Ursula can make her dreams come true. She follows them to Ursula's lair where she has magic potions. She uses her magic to turn Ariel into a human for exactly three days, in exchange for her voice. In order to stay human, she has to kiss Prince Eric, or else she will turn back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula. Eric shows her his palace and helps her adapt. On the second day, Sebastian the crab gathers the other sea animals together and they sing "Kiss the Girl", hoping to make Eric kiss Ariel. The plan almost works, but Flotsam and Jetsam cause the boat to sink. Ursula decides that enough is enough and uses Ariel's voice to turn herself into a beautiful girl named Vanessa. She casts a hypnotic spell on Eric to make him forget about Ariel. The next day, everyone finds out that Eric is getting married, and Ariel is very sad. Scuttle finds out that the girl Eric is marrying is Ursula in disguise. He tells Ariel and manages to create disruption, delaying the wedding. The seashell Ursula is wearing breaks and Ariel's voice comes back. She tries to kiss Eric, but the sun sets and she turns back into a mermaid. Ursula offers to let Ariel go if Triton takes her place. He accepts it and turns into a plant. With help from Sebastian and Flounder, Prince Eric and Ariel defeat Ursula. Ursula dies and all the plants she had turn back into mermaids. Finally King Triton gives Ariel her wish and she is allowed to marry Prince Eric.

<doc id="365381" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=365381" title="Thutmose I">
Thutmose I

Thutmose I (also known as "Thothmes," "Thutmosis" or "Tuthmosis I", meaning "Thoth-Born") was the third Pharaoh of the 18th dynasty of Ancient Egypt. He became pharaoh after the death of Amenhotep I. During his reign, he sent his armies into the Levant and Nubia, pushing the borders of Egypt further than ever before. He built many temples in Egypt and a tomb for himself in the Valley of the Kings. He is the first king known to have done this, though Amenhotep I may have done it first. He was succeeded by his son Thutmose II, and then his daughter, Hatshepsut. He ruled from 1506 to 1493 BC. Some scholars give his dates from 1526 BC to 1513 BC. This depends on where the astronomical observations used to calculate ancient Egyptian dates were made. If the observations were from the city of Memphis it would give the dates 20 years earlier than if it was Thebes.
Thutmose's father is unknown, but it may have been Amenhotep I. His mother, Senseneb, was not from a royal family and may have been a lesser wife or concubine of Amenhotep. Thutmoses's wife, Queen Ahmose, the Great Royal Wife, was probably the daughter of Ahmose I and the sister of Amenhotep I. There is some doubt, as she was never called a "king's daughter." Some historians believe that she was Thutmose's own sister. Thutmose's first son with Ahmose was Amenmose. He was born long before Thutmose's coronation. He can be seen on a stela from about 1522 BC hunting near Memphis. He became the commander of the army. Amenmose died about the same time as Thutmose. Thutmose had another son, Wadjmose, and two daughters, Hatshepsut and Nefrubity, by Ahmose. Wadjmose died before his father, and Nefrubity died as an infant. Thutmose had a son by another wife, Mutnofret. This son, married to Thutmose's daughter Hatshepsut, succeeded him as Thutmose II. Hatshepsut said that Thutmose gave the kingship to them both. However, this is considered to be propaganda by Hatshepsut's supporters to support her claim to the throne when she later took over power.
During the reign of Amenhotep I, the Egyptians recorded an astronomical event. This was the star Sothis appearing above the horizon at dawn. This is called a heliacal rising. Modern scientists believe that Sothis is the star that we call Sirius. If this observation was made at Thebes, it took place in 1517 BC. From this date, the date of Amenhotep's death, and Thutmose's coronation can be calculated to 1506 BC. But a few historians believe that the observations were made at either Heliopolis or Memphis. This would mean that Thutmose would have been crowned in 1526 BC.
An Egyptian priest, Manetho, writing in the third century BC, said that Thutmose I's reign lasted 12 Years and 9 Months (or 13 Years). This data is supported by two dated inscriptions from Years 8 and 9 of his reign with Thutmoses's cartouche found on a stone block in Karnak. Accordingly, Thutmose is usually said to have ruled from 1506 BC to 1493 BC, but some scholars date him from 1526 BC to 1513 BC
At the time Thutmose became king, Nubia rebelled against Egyptian rule. Thutmose travelled up the Nile with his army and fought in the battle, personally killing the Nubian king. He returned to Thebes with the Nubian king's body hung from the front of his ship. In the third year of his reign he led a another expedition against Nubia. He ordered the canal at the first cataract to be made deeper to make it easier to get his ships upstream. The canal had been first built by Sesostris III of the 12th Dynasty. This helped make Nubia part of the Egyptian empire. This expedition is mentioned in two separate inscriptions by the king's son Thure:
In the second year of Thutmose's reign, a stele at Tombos records that he built a fortress there. This is near the third cataract. Before this the Egyptian army had stopped at Buhen, at the second cataract. This stele says that he already fought in Syria. His Syrian campaign may be placed at the beginning of the second year of his rule. The Syrian campaign was the farthest north any Egyptian ruler had ever campaigned. Although it has not been found in modern times, he set up a stele when he crossed the Euphrates River. During this campaign, the Syrian princes declared loyalty to Thutmose. However, after he went back to Egypt, they stopped tribute and began building defences against future attacks. Thutmose celebrated his victories with an elephant hunt in the area of Niy, near Apamea in Syria. He returned to Egypt with strange tales of the Euphrates, "that inverted water which flows upstream when it ought to be flowing downstream." The Euphrates was the first major river which the Egyptians had seen which flowed from the north. This would be downstream on the Nile, instead of the south which was upstream on the Nile. The river became known in Egypt as the "inverted water."
Nubia rebelled against Egyptian rule again in his fourth year. He sent his army even farther south to stop it. An inscription from his reign has been found as far south as Kurgus, which was south of the fourth cataract. During his reign, he began a number of projects which effectively ended Nubian independence for the next 500 years. He enlarged a temple to Sesostris III and Khnum, opposite the Nile from Semna. There are also records of specific religious rites which the viceroy of El-Kab was to have performed in the temples in Nubia for the king. He also appointed a man, Turi, to the position of viceroy of Cush, also known as the "King's Son of Cush." With a civilian representative of the king living in Nubia itself, Nubia did not dare to revolt as often as it had. It was easily controlled by future Egyptian kings.
Thutmose I organized great building projects during his reign, including many temples and tombs. His greatest projects were at the Temple of Karnak under the supervision of the architect Ineni. Before this, Karnak probably consisted only of a long road to a central platform, with a number of shrines for the solar boats along the side of the road. Thutmose had the temple made much bigger. He had a fifth pylon built along the temple's main road. He built a wall around the inner temple and two flagpoles on either side of the gateway. Outside of this, he built a fourth pylon and another enclosing wall. He built a hypostyle hall between pylons four and five. This was made with columns of cedar wood. This was common in ancient Egyptian temples, and supposedly represents a papyrus marsh, an Egyptian symbol of creation. Along the edge of this room he built very large statues, each one alternating wearing the crown of Upper Egypt and the crown of Lower Egypt. Finally, outside of the fourth pylon, he built four more flagpoles and two obelisks. One of them, which now has fallen, was not inscribed until Thutmose III about 50 years later. The cedar columns in Thutmose I's hypostyle hall were replaced with stone columns by Thutmose III, however at least the northernmost two were replaced by Thutmose I himself. Hatshepsut also erected two of her own obelisks inside of Thutmose I's hypostyle hall.
Thutmose I also built statues of the Ennead at Abydos, buildings at Armant, Ombos, el-Hiba, Memphis, and Edfu, as well as minor expansions to buildings in Nubia, at Semna, Buhen, Aniba, and Quban.
Thutmose I was the first king who definitely was buried in the Valley of the Kings. The architect, Ineni, built the tomb, and his mortuary temple. This temple has not been found as it was probably destroyed by the building of Hatshepsut's mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri. 
Thutmose I was buried in a tomb now called KV20 dug high into the cliffs of the Valley of the Kings. His daughter Hatshepsut had the tomb made bigger, with a room big enough for both of their stone coffins (sarcophagus). His grandson, Thutmose III had him reburied in KV38. KV20 was rediscovered during the Napoleonic expedition of 1799. In 1844, the Prussian scholar Karl Richard Lepsius had explored its upper passage. However, many passageways were blocked by rocks, stones and other rubbish brought in during floods. In 1903-1904 Howard Carter, after two years of hard work, was able to clear the passages and enter the double burial chamber. He found broken pottery and shattered stone vessels from the burial chamber and lower passages. He found parts of two vases made for Queen Ahmose Nefertari, which were part of the original funerary equipment of Thutmose I. On one vase was written that Thutmose II "[made it] as his monument to his father." Other vessels which had the names and titles of Thutmose I had also been inscribed by his son and successor, Thutmose II. There were parts of stone vessels made for Hatshepsut before she herself became king which had her royal name of 'Maatkare'.
Carter, however, also discovered two separate coffins in the burial chamber. The beautifully carved sarcophagus of Hatshepsut "was discovered open with no sign of a body, and with the lid lying discarded on the floor." It is now in the Cairo Museum with a matching yellow quartzite canopic chest. A second sarcophagus, was found lying on its side, with its almost undamaged lid propped against the wall. This was given to Theodore M. Davis, who had paid for the excavation. Davis gave it to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The sarcophagus had originally been engraved with the name of "the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Maatkare Hatshepsut." However, when the sarcophagus was complete, Hatshepsut decided to have a new one made for herself. She used the first sarcophagus for her father, Thutmose I. The stonemasons then tried to erase the original carvings by restoring the surface of the quartzite so that it could be re-carved with the name and titles of Thuthmose I. The sarcophagus is seven feet long and three feet wide with walls five inches thick. It has text carved on it which records Hatshepsut's generosity towards her father:
After Hatshepsut's death, Thutmose III, Hatshepsut's successor, moved his grandfather to a magnificent new tomb, KV38. This had another yellow sarcophagus dedicated to Thutmose I. It was covered with texts which spoke of this pharaoh's love for his dead grandfather. Thutmose I's remains were disturbed during the 20th dynasty when KV38 was robbed. The sarcophagus' lid was broken and all this king's valuable precious jewellery and grave goods were stolen. The original coffin of Thutmose I was taken over and re-used by a later pharaoh of the 21st dynasty. In 1994 a flood refilled KV20 with stones and debris.
Thutmose I's mummy has not been yet been identified. He was reburied during 21st dynasty when the bodies of the pharaohs of the 18th and 19th dynasties were rewrapped and buried in the Deir el-Bahri Cache above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut. They were discovered in 1881. The mummies included Ahmose I, Amenhotep I, Thutmose II, Thutmose III, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses IX, as well as the 21st dynasty pharaohs Pinedjem I, Pinedjem II, and Siamun. Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, believed that unlabelled mummy #5283 was that of Thutmose I. The face had the same features as the mummies of Thutmose II and Thutmose III. Later research proved that it was an 18th dynasty mummy..
Gaston Maspero wrote:
This mummy can be viewed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. However, in 2007, Dr. Zahi Hawass announced that the mummy is that of a 30 year old man who had died as a result of an arrow wound to the chest. Because of the young age of the mummy and the cause of death, it could not be King Thutmose I.

Vaalbara

Vaalbara is the name of Earth's first supercontinent, in the Archaean era.
Vaalbara started to form about 3,600 million years ago (mya). It formed by about 3,100 mya and broke up by 2,500 mya. The name "Vaalbara" comes from the South African Kaapvaal craton and the West Australian Pilbara craton. These cratons were combined in the Vaalbara supercontinent.
South Africa's Kaapvaal craton and Western Australia's Pilbara craton are two of the best-preserved Archaean cratons on Earth. They have remarkably similar early Precambrian rocks. Identical radiometric ages of 3,470 ±2 mya have been got from rocky material thrown out by meteorite strikes. Similar structures from these two cratons have been dated between 3,500 to 2,700 mya. Similar greenstone belts are found at the edges of the Superior craton of Canada, and across the cratons of the former Gondwana and Laurasia continents.
Palaeomagnetic data from rocks in the cratons showed that at 3,870 mya the two cratons could have been part of the same supercontinent. Both the Pilbara and Kaapvaal cratons show extensional faults which were active about the same time during volcanism at the same time as the impact layers were formed.
Continental plates have periodically collided and assembled in periods of orogeny (mountain building) to form supercontinents. The cycle of supercontinent formation, breakup, dispersal and reformation by plate tectonics occurs every 450 million years or so.

However, these numbers are not exact. In Niger, many of the people who practice traditional religions have mixed some beliefs from Islam into their religions. Because of this, it is hard to say exactly how many people practice each religion.
Islam in Niger began to spread around a thousand years ago. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Islam became more common than Niger's traditional religions. Since then, Sufi brotherhoods have become the most common and powerful Muslim organisations, like in many West African countries. Because of this, there are many different interpretations (or ways of understanding and practicing) Islam in Niger. These different interpretations exist alongside each other, and alongside less common religions, usually peacefully.
The government of Niger is secular, or separate from any religion. At the same time, the government recognizes that Islam is the most popular religion in the country.

Islam in Nigeria

About 85,000,000 Nigerians are Muslims. That is about half of the people of Nigeria. Most of the rest of the people are Christian. Muslims in Nigeria are predominantly Sunni in the Maliki school, which is also the governing Sharia law. However, there is a significant Shia minority, mostly in Sokoto State (see Shia in Nigeria). A smaller number of people follow the Ahmadiyya Islam, a reformatory sect that started in 19th century India. Pew Forum on religious diversity says that 12% are Shia Muslims while 3% are Ahmadi Muslims.

Jasminum officinale

Jasminum officinale is the common jasmine. It is in the family Oleaceae. It is famous for its scent. It is also known as poet's jasmine or jessamine.
For thousands of years, the jasmine has been cultivated not only for the beauty of its small, white, star-like flowers, but also for its intoxicating scent. 
It is native to the foothills of the Western Himalayas and the Indus Valley plains of the Pakistani Punjab. The plant was cultivated and brought to the rest of the Indian subcontinent, China, the Middle East and other regions of Asia. From there, it spread into France, Italy and the Mediterranean, and eventually it was introduced to the rest of Western Europe and Britain. Today, jasmine is grown and cultivated all over the world in its many varieties. 
Since jasmine has been cultivated all over the world for its flowers and scent, there are different varieties, and each type of jasmine is associated with different meanings. In Pakistan, Jasmine is a very common plant and one can find it in any garden. Because of its attractive scent, the white jasmine symbolizes attachment and represents amiability and modesty; therefore, Jasmine was named the national flower of Pakistan.

<doc id="365412" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=365412" title="Rodinia">
Rodinia

Rodinia, meaning "to give birth", is the name of a supercontinent. It had most or all of Earth's landmass when the Neoproterozoic era began. 
Rodinia existed between 1.1 billion and 750 million years ago. It formed from parts of the older supercontinent, Columbia. 
Rodinia broke up in the first period of the Neoproterozoic, the Tonian. Later its continental fragments were re-assembled to form Pangaea 300250 million years ago. In contrast with Pangaea, little is known yet about the exact position and history of Rodinia. 
The extreme cooling of the global climate around 700 million years ago (the so called Snowball Earth of the Cryogenian period) and the rapid evolution of primitive life during the following Ediacaran and Cambrian periods may have been triggered by the breaking up of Rodinia.
The break-up of Rodinia is better understood than its formation. Extensive flood basalt flows and volcanic eruptions of Neoproterozoic age are found on most continents. This is evidence for large scale rifting about 750 million years ago. As early as 850 and 800 million years ago, a rift developed, eventually becoming an ocean in the Ediacaran.
In a separate rifting event about 610 million years ago (halfway in the Ediacaran period), the Iapetus Ocean formed. It might be that all continental mass was again joined in one supercontinent between roughly 600 and 550 million years ago. This hypothetical supercontinent is called Pannotia.
Unlike later supercontinents, Rodinia itself was entirely barren. It existed before life colonized dry land. It was before the formation of the ozone layer, so it was too exposed to the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight for any organism (except perhaps bacteria) to live on it. However, its existence probably did affect the marine life of its time.
In the Cryogenian period the Earth experienced large glaciations, and temperatures were at least as cool as today. Substantial areas of Rodinia may have been covered by glaciers or the southern polar ice cap.
The eventual rifting of the continents created new oceans, and seafloor spreading, which produces warmer, less-dense oceanic lithosphere. Due to its lower density, hot oceanic lithosphere does not lie so deep as old, cool oceanic lithosphere. In periods with relatively large areas of new lithosphere, the ocean floors come up, causing the sea level to rise. The result was a greater number of shallower seas.
The increased evaporation from the larger water area of the oceans may have increased rainfall, which, in turn, increased the weathering of exposed rock. This increased rainfall may have reduced greenhouse gas levels. When CO level dropped, the period known as Snowball Earth began. Increased volcanic activity also introduced nutrients into the seas. This may have played an important role in the development of the earliest animals.

Resusci Anne

Resusci Anne, also known as Rescue Anne, Resusci Annie or CPR Annie, is a training mannequin used for teaching cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). It is for both emergency workers and members of the general public. Resusci Anne was made by Norwegian toy maker Åsmund Laerdal. It was based on the research of Peter Safar and James Elam. It was first used in 1960. The mannequin is made to be just like the human respiratory system and outer body in order to help training.
Since its first use, several different versions of Resusci Anne have been introduced. These include versions with computer monitoring, and versions that seem like other emergency medical conditions, such as severe wounds and trauma.
Trainees using the original Resusci Anne were expected to approach the mannequin. After getting no response, the trainees then administered CPR to the mannequin. This system was meant to teach trainees that not all victims require CPR. If a victim can respond when asked if okay, the victim does not need CPR.
The face of Resusci Anne was based on "L'Inconnue de la Seine". It was the death mask of an unidentified young woman who may have drowned in the Seine River around the late 1880s.

John Gurdon

Sir John Bertrand Gurdon (JBG) FRS (born 2 October 1933) is a British developmental biologist. He is best known for his pioneering research in nuclear transplantation, and cloning. He was awarded the Lasker Award in 2009 and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2012.
Gurdon was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1971, and was knighted in 1995. In 2004, the Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Institute for Cell Biology and Cancer was renamed the Gurdon Institute in his honour. He has also received numerous awards, medals and honorary degrees. He has been awarded the 2009 Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research award. 
In 2012 Gurdon was awarded, jointly with Shinya Yamanaka, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent". "Pluripotent" cells are stem cells.
In 1958, Gurdon, then at the University of Oxford, successfully cloned a frog using intact nuclei from the somatic cells of a "Xenopus" tadpole. This was an important extension of work of Briggs and King in 1952 on transplanting nuclei from embryonic blastula cells.
Gurdon’s experiments captured the attention of the scientific community and the tools and techniques he developed for nuclear transfer are still used today.
Gurdon and colleagues also pioneered the use of "Xenopus" (genus of highly aquatic frog) eggs and oocytes to translate microinjected messenger RNA molecules. This technique has been widely used to identify the proteins encoded, and to study their function.
Gurdon's recent research has focused on analysing intercellular signalling factors involved in cell differentiation, and on elucidating the mechanisms involved in reprogramming the nucleus in transplantation experiments, including demethylation of the transplanted DNA.

He researches into adult stem cells. He is director of Center for iPS Cell Research and Application and a professor at the Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences at Kyoto University. He is also a senior investigator at the UCSF-affiliated J. David Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco, California; and a professor of anatomy at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Yamanaka is also the current president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR).
In development, embryonic stem cells can turn into any tissue. Fibroblasts in the skin are one type of cell.
In 2006, Yamanaka and his team took adult mouse fibroblasts and turned them back into stem cells in tissue culture. The changed cells are known as 'induced pluripotent stem cells' (iPS cells). iPS cells are like embryonic stem cells from a blastocyst (the embryo a few days after fertilization).
The procedure used transfection of some stem cell-associated genes into the adult fibroblasts. The transfected genes include the master transcriptional regulators. Transfection is typically done with viral vectors, such as retroviruses.
The team could show that the iPS cells were pluripotent (capable of generating all cell lineages of the body). Soon they grew mice which included iPS cells. In 2007, he and his team generated iPS cells from "human" adult fibroblasts, again the first group to do so. The main medical application will be replacement of faulty or damaged tissues in humans. This is not available at present. An independent assessment of this field is available.

MV Empire Windrush

The Empire Windrush arrived at Tilbury on 22 June 1948, carrying 493 passengers from Jamaica wishing to start a new life in the United Kingdom. The passengers (including one stowaway) were the first large group of West Indian immigrants to the UK after the Second World War.
When the people from the "Windrush" arrived at port, they were faced with discrimination and racism because of the colour of their skin. Some people now call the "Windrush" a new journey for them as they all went through the racism, but in the end, came out just as equal as everyone else.
Before 1948, the ship, under the name of "Monte Rosa", had been used for cruises in pre-war Germany, and then as a German troopship and prisoner transport ship, before being captured by the British and taken as a war prize. She continued to be used as a British troopship after 1948, but sank in the Mediterranean Sea in March 1954 after a sudden and catastrophic fire in her engine room, just off the coast of Algeria.
