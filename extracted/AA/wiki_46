ABC Kids (US)

ABC Kids was a televisionprogramming block on the ABC television network. It broadcasted several different children's series. These series were all owned by Disney, which owns ABC. Most of them were also shown on Disney's own network Disney Channel. ABC Kids used to be called Disney's One Saturday Morning.
ABC Kids ended on August 27, 2011. On September 3, 2011 the block was replaced with "Litton's Weekend Adventure".
On September 13, 1997, "Disney's One Saturday Morning" started out as a two-hour block on the "ABC Saturday Morning" lineup, and aired some of the shows that aired on it. In 1999, it was extended to 5 hours. On September 6, 1999, a spin-off, "Disney's One Too", aired on UPN and in syndication every weekday in the morning or afternoon and Sunday morning. "One Saturday Morning"' last aired on September 7, 2002.
On September 14, 2002, Disney renamed "One Saturday Morning" to ABC Kids. The block originally contained new programs, but by the end, all of ABC Kids programs became repeats of Disney Channel originals.
"Power Rangers" was previously aired on Fox Kids until halfway through the "Wild Force" season, when "Power Rangers" moved to ABC Kids for the 2002 Fall season due to the Fox Family Channel/Saban Entertainment purchase by Disney in 2001. Starting with the episode "Unfinished Business", the remainder of the "Wild Force" season premiered on ABC Kids. During its time on both Fox Kids and ABC Kids the entire "Wild Force" season also reran later on ABC Family (in part both prior to the introduction of and during the ABC Family Action Block). The following "Ninja Storm" season also premiered on ABC Kids and then reran later on the ABC Family Action Block. The "Dino Thunder", "S.P.D.", "Mystic Force", "Operation Overdrive" and "Jungle Fury" seasons were all premiered on Jetix and then reran on ABC Kids. The "RPM" season and broadcasts of the first season of "Mighty Morphin", newly re-versioned, aired exclusively on ABC Kids.
"Power Rangers" ended its run on ABC Kids on August 28, 2010, nationwide due to Haim Saban having bought back the intellectual rights to the franchise from Disney and giving airing rights to Nickelodeon in May 2010. Airings ended slightly earlier on August 14, 2010, on West coast affiliates due to a two-week preemption caused by the 2010 Little League World Series and the E/I recovery that resulted from it. On September 4, 2010, the hour held by "Power Rangers" was returned to the local affiliates. After its completion on ABC Kids, "Power Rangers" moved to Nickelodeon. All new seasons (starting with the "Samurai" season) began to premiere on the main Nickelodeon channel on February 7, 2011. Repeats of new seasons and all previous seasons began airing on Nicktoons on February 11, 2011.
With the rise of federally-mandated E/I programming guidelines, some of the network's affiliate groups, primarily Hearst Television and Allbritton Communications, refused to carry any show that did not fulfill E/I requirements (such as "Kim Possible" or the "Power Rangers" series during their time on ABC Kids) in order to instead free up time to air locally produced programming. However, some stations time shifted these shows either to very early in the morning Saturday or to Sunday, often before local news, "Good Morning America" and/or that week's "live" portion of the ABC Kids block began.
ABC Kids was aired for the final time on August 27, 2011. After that, ABC discontinued airing animated programming, making it the first not to air animated programs since September 1992, when NBC stopped airing animated programs to make room for TNBC.
On May 24, 2011, ABC announced that it had reached a deal with broadcast syndication production company Litton Entertainment to produce original content for the Saturday morning block. The "Litton's Weekend Adventure" block launched on September 3, 2011, replacing ABC Kids.

RLC circuit

A circuit containing resistance (R), inductance (L), and capacitance (C) is called an RLC circuit. A simple circuit only has one RLC series.
With a resistance "R" present, the total electromagnetic energy "U" of the circuit (the sum of the electric energy and magnetic energy) is no longer constant. Instead, it decreases with time as energy is transferred to thermal energy in the resistance. Because of this loss of energy, the oscillations of charge, current and potential difference continuously decrease in amplitude, and the oscillations are said to be damped. 
They are damped in exactly the same way as those of the damped block-spring oscillator. To analyze the oscillations of this circuit, an equation can be written for the total electromagnetic energy formula_1 in the circuit at any instant. This is because the resistance does not store electromagnetic energy.
However, this total energy decreases as energy is transferred to thermal energy. 
where the minus sign indicates that formula_1 decreases. By differentiating Eq. 1 with respect to time and then substituting the result in Eq. 2, the following is obtained:
Substituting formula_6 for formula_7 and formula_8 for formula_9, the following is obtained:

Jackstones

Jackstones is a traditional Korean game. It is usually played by girls. The game is similar to the game Jacks. Jackstones is played by girls in rural villages of Andhra Pradesh by the name of Achenagandlu or Achamgilla or Chintapikkala aata, using small stones or Tamarind seeds. 
The game is played with five stones. Each stone is about the size of an almond. Players can only use one hand to play the game. The game has five parts or "stages".
In the first stage, the player throws the stones on the ground. They pick up one stone and throw it upward. Before the stone falls onto the ground, they need to pick up another stone from the ground and then catch the one that was thrown. This is done again until there are no stones on the ground. 
The second stage is the same with the first stage except that the player needs to pick up two stones at once before the stone which was thrown falls down. The third and the fourth stages are the same. 
In the fifth stage, players can get points. All of the stones are thrown upward. The player must catch as many of the stones as they can with the back of their hand. Then, the stones they caught are thown into the air again and the player must catch all of them. The player gets points for how many stones they catch. If they caught 3 stones, they get 3 points. If they caught 4 stones, they get four points. After that, the next player does the same. When all players have done this, the game is finished. The person (or the team) who has a higher point wins.
Also there are several rules;
If a player is out, the next person (or team) gets the turn.

Lorentz force

Lorentz's law is a law discovered by the Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz. Lorentz's law defines force that acts on moving charged particles in an electromagnetic field. Force consists of magnetic force and electric force.
F = qE (electric force)
If the charge is positive, the direction of the electric force is equal to direction of electric field.
F = qv*B (magnetic force)
The direction of the magnetic force is given by the right hand rule.
If charged particles move with velocity v in an electric field E and a magnetic field B
F = qE + qv*B
F : force (vector)
q : charge (scalar)
E : electric field (vector)
v : velocity of particle (vector)
B : magnetic field (vector)
Using this law, J.J. Thomson measured mass-to-charge ratio.

Snell's law

Snell's law is the scientific law of the refraction of light or other waves. In optics, Snell's law is about the speed of light in different media. The law states that when light passes through different materials (for example from air to glass) the ratio of sines of the incidence (incoming) angle and the refraction (outgoing) angle does not change:
With each formula_2 as the angle measured from the normal of the boundary, formula_3 as the velocity of light in the respective medium (SI units are meters per second, or m/s). formula_4 is the refractive index of the medium. 
The index of refraction of a vacuum is 1 and the velocity of light in a vacuum is formula_5. When a wave passes the material where the index of refraction is n, the velocity of the wave becomes formula_6.
Snell's law can be proved by Fermat's principle. Fermat's principle states that "light travels along the path which takes the least time". 
The idea has a long history. The problem had the attention of Hero of Alexandria, Ptolemy, Ibn Sahl, and Huygens. Ibn Sahl actually discovered the law of refraction. In "Trait√© de la Lumiere", 1678, Huygens showed how Snell's law of sines could be explained by, or derived from, the wave nature of light.

Golden lion tamarin

The golden lion tamarin ("Leontopithecus rosalia"), also called the golden lion marmoset is a small, squirrel-sized monkey with a lion-like mane. 
Tamarins live in small family groups. They are diurnal (most active during the day); at night, they rest in the cavity of a tree. The life span is about 15 years. They are in danger of extinction due to loss of habitat as their forest home is being cleared. These tamarins are arboreal (they live in trees). They live in coastal tropical rainforests in eastern Brazil of South America.
The golden lion tamarin is an omnivore (eating both animals and plants); it eats insects, fruit, small snakes, lizards, snails, spiders, and vegetables. Tamarins use their claws to dig for insects in the bark of trees.

Piet Mondrian

Piet Mondrian (7 March 1872 ‚Äì 1 February 1944) was a Dutch modern artist of the De stijl group. His early paintings show abstract landscapes in post-impressionist and cubist style. 
He painted in an increasingly abstract style, until he finally achieved the style which made him famous. By 1920, he adopts a totally abstract motif, with an irregular checkerboard drawn with black lines, and with the spaces paints mostly white or sometimes in the primary colors of blue, red and yellow. This style is geometric abstraction with primary color.
Mondrian painted about 250 of these geometric abstracts, from 1917 to 1944. Mondrian called his style ‚Äúneoplasticism‚Äù.
Escaping in 1940 from a Europe at war, Mondrian spent the last four years of his life in New York City. His paintings of that time express exuberance at city life. In his final painting, "Broadway Boogie Woogie" (1942/43), the checkerboard lines, previously black, are now painted blue, gray, red and yellow. The yellow was apparently inspired by New York‚Äôs Yellow cabs.

2004 Pacific hurricane season

The 2004 Pacific hurricane season officially started May 15, 2004 in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 2004 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 2004. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.
Tropical Depression Five-E formed south of Mexico on July 26. Later that day, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Darby, and only four hours later, at 2 am (0900 UTC) on July 27, is upgraded to Hurricane Darby. It moved due west at this point, aiming directly for the big island of Hawaii. It reached Category 3 strength on July 29, the first major hurricane in the northeastern Pacific basin since 2002. However, long before it reached Hawaii, it lost strength and dissipated on the evening of July 31.
Tropical Depression Eleven_E formed from a tropical wave about 400¬†mi. southwest of Acapulco, Mexico and headed northwest, steadily strengthening as it did so. Howard peaked briefly as a Category 4 and then started to weaken. By the time Howard reached a point off the coast of the Baja peninsula, it was only a tropical storm. Howard weakened further, becoming a tropical depression on September 5 and degenerated into a remnant low later that day. The low hooked around and headed southwest. Howard dissipated on September 10 without making landfall.
Tropical Depression Thirteen-E formed out of an area of low pressure south-southeast of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on September 10. It slowly moved northwest, being designated Tropical Storm Javier on the morning of September 11. It was upgraded to a hurricane on the afternoon of September 12, and peaked at Category 4 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale after rapidly strengthening on September 13. 
Warnings began to be issued on September 15 for Baja California. While Javier peaked at Category 4, with windspeeds of 150¬†mph (240¬†km/h), it weakened dramatically before striking land south of San Ignacio in Baja Sur as only a tropical depression. Its remnants continued over Baja and inland.
An area of tropical disturbance centered about 90 miles (150¬†km) south-southwest of Puerto Angel, Mexico, developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on the afternoon of October 11. Due to its proximity, attention was immediately paid to it, and Mexico began issuing watches early the next day. With the 2 pm PDT (2100 UTC) update on October 12, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named Lester.
It sat mainly stationary just off the coast of Mexico, spending most of October 13 only 25 miles (40¬†km) west of Acapulco. In the afternoon, it became clear that Lester was falling apart, and with the 2 pm update, even though it was still close to shore, it was downgraded to a tropical depression and advisories ended as it rapidly disintegrated.

Stellar classification

In astronomy, stellar classification is a way of grouping stars by temperature. Star temperature can be measured by looking at its spectrum, the type of light that the star shines.
Stars are also grouped into spectral types or classes by color. In general, a star's temperature determines its color, from red to blue-white. Spectral types are named with a letter: "M", "K", "G", "F", "A", "B" and "O". "M" stars are the coldest stars and "O" stars are the hottest.
The closest star to the Earth, the sun, is a class G star.
The Harvard classification system is a one-dimensional classification scheme. Stars vary in surface temperature from about 2,000 to 40,000 kelvin. Physically, the classes indicate the temperature of the star's atmosphere and are normally listed from hottest to coldest, as is done in the following table: 
Note: The conventional color description describe only the peak of the stellar spectrum. However, the actual apparent colors the eye sees are lighter than the conventional color descriptions. 
The mass, radius, and luminosity listed for each class are appropriate only for stars on the main-sequence portion of their lives and so are not appropriate for red giants. The spectral classes O through M are subdivided by Arabic numerals (0‚Äì9). For example, A0 denotes the hottest stars in the A class and A9 denotes the coolest ones. The Sun is classified as G2.
The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is more often used in astronomy, because it relates three important variables: the absolute magnitude, the luminosity and the surface temperature. It is as important to astronomy as the periodic table is to chemistry.
The "conventional color" descriptions are traditional in astronomy, and represent colors relative to the mean color of an "A-class star" which is considered to be white. The "apparent color" descriptions are what the observer would see if trying to describe the stars under a dark sky without aid to the eye, or with binoculars. 
The Sun itself is white, though it is sometimes called a yellow star. This is a natural consequence of the evolution of human optical senses: the response curve that maximizes the overall efficiency against solar illumination will by definition perceive the Sun as white, though there is some subjective variation between observers.

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 movie)

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is an American animated musical fantasy movie from 1937. It was made by Walt Disney Productions and released by RKO Radio Pictures. It is based on the German fairy tale "Snow White" by the Brothers Grimm. It is the first full-length cel animated movie and the earliest in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. The story was adapted by storyboard artists Dorothy Ann Blank, Richard Creedon, Merrill De Maris, Otto Englander, Earl Hurd, Dick Rickard, Ted Sears and Webb Smith. David Hand was the supervising director, while William Cottrell, Wilfred Jackson, Larry Morey, Perce Pearce, and Ben Sharpsteen directed the movie's different sequences.
"Snow White" was first shown at the Carthay Circle Theatre on December 21, 1937. It was released across the United States on February 4, 1938. With international earnings of $8 million during its initial release, the movie for a bit had the record of highest grossing sound movie at the time. The popularity of the movie has led to it being re-released theatrically many times, until its home video release in the 1990s. Adjusted for inflation, it is one of the top ten performers at the North American box office.
At the 11th Academy Awards, Walt Disney was awarded an honorary Oscar. The movie was nominated for Best Musical Score. It was added to the United States National Film Registry in 1989 and is ranked in the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest American films, who also named the movie as the greatest American animated movie of all time in 2008. Disney's take on the fairytale has had a huge cultural impact, resulting in popular theme park attractions, a video game, and a Broadway musical.
An evil queen has a mirror and asks "Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?" The mirror answers "Snow White". Snow White is lost in the woods, and comes across the home of seven little men, or dwarves. She cleans their home, and they allow her to stay with them. The queen eventually finds out that the heart in the box is of a pig so she goes and changes herself onto an old hag. She goes to the dwarfs' cottage the next day while they're out and gets Snow White to bite into an apple with makes her fall dead. Suddenly, the dwarfs chase the old hag up a cliff and trap her. She tries to roll a boulder over them but lightning strikes and she dies. Snow White is awakened by the kiss of a handsome prince.
Development on "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" began in early 1934, and in June 1934, Walt Disney announced the production of his first feature to the "New York Times". Before "Snow White", the Disney studio had been mainly involved in the production of highly successful animated shorts in the "Mickey Mouse" and "Silly Symphonies" series. Disney hoped to enlarge his studio's reputation and money by moving into features, and estimated that "Snow White" could be produced for a budget of $250,000 - ten times the budget of an average "Silly Symphony".
Walt Disney had to fight to get the movie produced. Both his brother Roy Disney and his wife Lillian attempted to talk him out of it, and the Hollywood movie industry mockingly referred to the movie as "Disney's Folly" while it was in production. He even had to mortgage his house to help finance the movie's production, which eventually ran up a total cost of just over $1.5 million, a huge sum for a movie in 1937.
Unvoiced characters include Snow White's animal friends, the Queen's raven, and the vultures who follow the Witch. However, although the animals did not have human speaking voices, their natural calls were very lifelike, and were all voiced by champion whistler and animal mimic A. Purves Pullen, who would provide bird and animal calls for Disney movies (including numerous Pluto cartoons) for several decades. Pullen also produced the bird calls for the Enchanted Tiki Room attractions at Disney theme parks. During the 1940s and 1950s, he performed as "Dr. Horatio Q. Birdbath" with the 
comedy band Spike Jones & His City Slickers.
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" was first shown in cinemas on December 21, 1937. It was released across the United States on February 4, 1938. It has been re-released many times since. The first time was in 1944, in order to raise money for the Disney studio during World War II. This set a tradition of re-releasing Disney animated features every seven to ten years. "Snow White" was re-released to theaters in 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1987 and 1993.
Disney's wife, Lillian, told him that no one will go pay anything to see a dwarf picture. "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" premiered at the Carthay Circle Theater on December 21, 1937 to a very impressed audience, many of the same people who called the movie "Disney's Folly." The movie received a prasie from many child actors audience that included Charlie Chaplin and Paulette Goddard, Shirley Temple, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Judy Garland, Ginger Rogers, Jack Benny, Fred MacMurray, Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, Burns and Allen, Ed Sullivan, Milton Berle, John Barrymore, and Marlene Dietrich. Six days later, Walt Disney and the seven dwarfs appeared on the cover of "Time" magazine. The "New York Times" said "Thank you very much, Mr. Disney." RKO Radio Pictures put the movie into general release on February 4, 1938, and it went on to become a huge box-office success, making more money than any other movie in 1938. In fact, for a short time, "Snow White" was the highest-grossing movie in American cinema history, until it was beat by "Gone with the Wind" in 1939. When taking inflation into account, and including rereleases, the movie still remains one of the top ten American movie moneymakers of all time.
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" was the first full-length animated feature movie made in English and Technicolor (not counting the "Academy Award Review of Walt Disney Cartoons"), and won an Academy Award for Walt Disney as a huge movie which has charmed millions and started a great new form of entertainment. Disney won a full-size Oscar statuette and seven small ones, given to him by 10-year-old child actress Shirley Temple.
The movie was also nominated for Best Musical Score. "Some Day My Prince Will Come" has become a jazz standard that has been performed by numerous artists, including Buddy Rich, Lee Wiley, Oscar Peterson, and Miles Davis.
Noted moviemakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin praised the movie as a huge achievement in cinema. The movie inspired Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to produce its own fantasy movie, "The Wizard of Oz" in 1939. The 1943 "Merrie Melodies" short "Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs", directed by Bob Clampett, parodies "Snow White" by presenting the story with an all-black cast singing a jazz score.
In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its "Ten top Ten"‚Äîthe best ten movies in ten "classic" American movie genres. After polling over 1,500 people from the creative community, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" was acknowledged as the best movie in the animation genre.
Snow White's Scary Adventures is a popular theme park ride at Disneyland (an opening day attraction dating from 1955), Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris. Snow White, her Prince, and the Seven Dwarfs are also featured in parades and character appearances throughout the parks.
A video game was released for the Game Boy Color system. Snow White appears in the popular PlayStation 2 game "Kingdom Hearts" as one of the seven fabled Princesses of Heart.

Captain Jack Harkness

Captain Jack Harkness is a fictional character in the British television series "Doctor Who" and "Torchwood". He is played by actor John Barrowman. He was first in "Doctor Who" in the 2005 episode "The Empty Child" and is in the show throughout the rest of the 2005 series as a companion of the Ninth Doctor. Jack later becomes the main character in "Torchwood", an adult-themed spin-off of "Doctor Who". He comes back into "Doctor Who" in the 2007 series and he meets the Tenth Doctor, and returned again for the 2008 series.
Jack is a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century. A bisexual. In contrast to the wiser and older Doctor, Jack prefers a hands-on solution to the problem at hand. As a consequence of his death and being brought back in the last episode of the 2005 series of "Doctor Who", the character becomes immortal, which does not change during both "Doctor Who" and "Torchwood".
 In naming the character, executive producer and head writer Russell T Davies got inspiration from the Marvel Comics character Agatha Harkness, Jack's original appearances in "Doctor Who" were thought of with the intention of forming a character arc in which Jack is changed from a coward to a hero, and John Barrowman consciously minded this in his portrayal of the character. Following on that arc, the character's debut episode would leave his morality as ambiguous, publicity materials asking, "Is he a force for good or ill?"
The character is described as both "lethally charming... good looking and utterly captivating", as well as "flirtatious, cunning, clever and a bit of an action man". Within "Doctor Who", Jack's personality is light-hearted, although this changes in "Torchwood"'s first series, where he becomes a darker character. In "Torchwood" Series 1, Jack has been shaped by his ongoing search for the Doctor and also by his role as a leader, in which he is predominantly more aloof. During The second series of "Torchwood", Jack became a much more light-hearted character once again, after appearances in "Doctor Who" where he was reunited with the Doctor.
From the Torchwood onwards, Harkness wears period military clothes from the second World War, including braces and an officer's wool greatcoat in every appearance. Costume designer Ray Holman comments that "We always wanted to keep the World War Two hero look for him, so all his outfits have a 1940s flavor. We knew he'd be running around a lot, so I redesigned his RAF Group Captain's greatcoat from "Doctor Who" to make it more fluid, because the real things are very weighty... The rest of Jack's costumes are loosely wartime based, so he has big wartime trousers which are getting more and more styled to suit his figure. There are actually five Captain Jack coats used on the show - one hero version which is used for most scenes, one wetcoat made with a pre-shrunk fabric, a running coat which is slightly shorter so John's heels do not catch when he runs and two stunt coats - which were 'hero coats' back in Series 1."
Discussing whether his character could ever find a soulmate, John Barrowman refutes that Jack "likes everybody, and his love for each person is different". He believes that Jack does harbour romantic feelings toward the Doctor, but "would never take that beyond infatuation" and "would never let the Doctor know". Barrowman describes Jack's love for Ianto as "lustful", and if he ever were to settle down with him, he would "let Ianto know that he [Jack] has to play around on the side". John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd have also opined that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him. In contrast, if he settled down with Gwen, "he'd have to commit completely" to her; this is why he does not act on his feelings for her, because even though she would let him flirt with other people, he could "never afford to do anything more Eve Myles, who portrays Gwen, describes theirs as a "palpable love" and opines that "with Jack and Gwen, it‚Äôs the real thing and they‚Äôre going to make you wait for that." "Torchwood" Series Two sees Jack promise both Gwen and Ianto that they were the reason he returned to Cardiff. Barrowman claims that Jack also "fancies" fellow companion Martha Jones, admiring her "tenacity" and willingness to "spat with him", and describes Jack's love for Toshiko and Owen as "fatherly", stating "He was guiding them. That's why it was so devastating for him to lose them." Offering reasons why Jack could never find "The One", Barrowman brings up the character's immortality. "He always loses them. He outlives them. They die. He watches them get old. That bothered him in Series One [of "Torchwood"], but now he's come to terms with that, I think... so now he just sleeps around!"
In several instances in "Torchwood", Jack displays no problems with killing a person of any species, which within "Doctor Who", allows Jack's character to act in ways the lead character cannot. When reuniting with the Doctor in the 2007 series, he is verbally warned "don't you dare" when pointing a gun. Witnessing the murder of his colleague Owen, Jack shoots his killer in the forehead, killing him in an act of quick revenge. Whilst the Doctor scorns Jack for joining the Torchwood Institute (an organisation he perceives as xenophobic and aggressive), Jack maintains that he reformed the Institute in the Doctor's image; Jack himself had initially been critical of the moral failings of a 19th-century Torchwood.

Hurricane Fico

Hurricane Fico of the 1978 Pacific hurricane season was a tropical cyclone that caused damage in Hawaii.
 A tropical depression formed on July 7 and organized into the sixth tropical storm of the season the next day. Initially heading west-northwest, it changed direction to almost due west shortly after reaching Category 4 intensity on July 11. After spending over a day at that intensity, Fico decayed and fell back down to a mid-range Category 1 on July 14. Fico then reintensified back to Category 4 strength the next day.
The hurricane's strength fluctuated, but Fico stayed a major hurricane until July 17, when it entered the central Pacific as a Category 1. It slowly intensified and became a major hurricane yet again on the 21st. At this point, Fico turned to the northwest and slowly lost strength. The storm dropped to a tropical storm early on July 28, and went extratropical later that day. At a later date, the remnants were enmeshed in a frontal system which headed towards the Aleutian Islands.
Fico was a tropical cyclone for 20 days, and travelled a distance of roughly 5500¬†mi (9000¬†km), both of which were records. It was also a hurricane for 17 consecutive days. Both of Fico's records have been broken. Hurricane Tina and then Hurricane John outlasted Fico. John also outran its distance record.
Fico never made landfall. Despite this, it pounded the Big Island with 15-30 foot waves doing "considerable damage" to roads and buildings along the coast. Smaller waves also broke on the southern shores of Maui with minimal effects. Six people aboard a sloop were washed overboard and rescued, while a tugboat was driven aground on a reef at Kukuiula. A weakening Fico also caused a sharp wind gradient, producing gusty gale-force winds that blew across the islands, knocking over trees and causing power outages. Fico's extratropical remnants caused heavy rains and gales south of Cold Bay in the Aleutians.
The name Fico was retired after this storm and replaced with Fabio in the 1982 season.

Bayinnaung Kyawhtin Nawrahta (Burmese: ·Äò·ÄØ·Äõ·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫·Äî·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫ ·ÄÄ·Äª·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äë·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äî·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äõ·Äë·Ä¨, ; 16 January 1516 ‚Äì 9 November 1581) was the third king of the Toungoo dynasty of Burma (Myanmar). He was king for 30 years. This time has been called the "greatest explosion of human energy ever seen in Burma". As king, Bayinnaung created the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia. This empire included much of Burma, Manipur, Chinese Shan States (southern Yunnan), Lan Na (northern Thailand), Siam (central and southern Thailand) and Lan Xang (Laos and northeastern Thailand).
Bayinnaung's made the Shan States part of the Burmese kingdoms. This removed the threat of Shan raids into Upper Burma. This had been a concern to Upper Burma since the late 13th century. The kink took control of the Shan States in 1557. He put in an administrative system that took away much of the power of the Shan saophas (chiefs). The also made changes to some of their customs to make them similar to other customs in the kingdoms. His policy for dealing with the Shan was used by all Burmese kings until the kingdom was taken control of by the British in 1885.
He could not use this policy everywhere in his very large empire. His empire was a group of former sovereign kingdoms. The kings of each of the kingdoms were loyal to him. He was the Cakravartin (Universal Ruler). They were not loyal to the kingdom itself. Siam left the kingdom three years after of his death in 1584. By 1599, all the sub-kingdoms had left. Bayinnaung's empire had ended.
He is thought to be one of the three best Burmese kings. The other two are Anawrahta and Alaungpaya. Many well known places in modern Myanmar are named after him. He is also well known in Thailand because of a popular song and book. Both are called "Phu Chana Sip Thit". The name means "the Conqueror of Ten Directions."

Tropical Storm Ana (2003)

Tropical Storm Ana was the only tropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic Ocean in the month of April. Ana was the first tropical storm of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. Tropical Storm Ana was two kinds of storms, a "subtropical cyclone", and a "tropical cyclone". It formed as a subtropical cyclone on April 20, while it was to the west of Bermuda. It moved towards the east-southeast and began to get better organized. On April 21, the subtropical cyclone became a tropical cyclone. Tropical Storm Ana then turned towards the east-northeast. It quickly lost strength because of wind shear and a close cold front. On April 24, Ana became an extratropical cyclone. 
The storm moved near Bermuda, while causing light rainfall. The remnants of the storm also dropped rain in the Azores and the United Kingdom. Stormy sea waters caused by the storm capsized a boat near Florida coastline. The incident killed two people.
A low pressure area formed to the south, and southwest, of Bermuda on April 18. A trough, which is a type of weather system, brought an area of clouds into the low pressure system. The low pressure system moved towards the north. After turning towards the northwest, the weather system looped southeastward. Thunderstorm activity became stronger near the center of the cyclone. The storm was named Subtropical Storm Ana on April 20, while located about 250¬†miles (400¬†km) west of Bermuda.
The subtropical storm moved to the east-southeastward and it continued to get stronger. It is estimated that Ana became a tropical storm by 0000¬†UTC on April 21. When it became a tropical cyclone, Ana reached its highest winds of 60¬†mph (95¬†km/h). Shortly after, Ana came close to Bermuda. Strong wind shear began to remove a lot of the thunderstorm activity from Ana. Ana continued to move eastward, and early on April 22, the wind shear again removed the thunderstorms from the center of the storm. After turning towards the northeast, the core of Ana merged with a cold front on April 24. Because of t his, Tropical Storm Ana turned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of the cyclone sped towards the east-northeastward, before it died out on April 27.
Before Ana was formed, the government of Bermuda declared a gale warning for the island. When Ana formed, a tropical storm warning was also issued for Bermuda. The storm moved close to Bermuda and dropped 2.63¬†inches (67¬†mm) of rainfall the Bermuda International Airport. The winds on the island were light. 
Stormy seas from the storm reached the coast of Florida in the United States. A couple of factors, which included the stormy seas, caused a boat to capsize in Jupiter Inlet. Two people on the ship drowned, and the others were rescued. The remnants of Ana dropped 0.87¬†inches (22¬†mm) of rainfall in the city of Ponta Delgada in the Azores. Clouds from the remnants of Ana also caused rain in the United Kingdom. Two ships experienced tropical storm force winds because of Ana.
Ana was the second subtropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin in the month of April. When the storm became a tropical cyclone, it was also the first Atlantic tropical storm in the month of April. Because the damage from Ana was not bad, the name "Ana" was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization. The name Ana was used again in 2009.

Hymenoptera

The Hymenoptera is one of the larger orders of insect. It includes the wasps, bees, ants and sawflies. There are over 130,000 recognised species, with many more remaining to be described. The name is derived from the Greek words "hymen" meaning 'membrane' and "ptera" meaning 'wings. The hindwings are connected to the forewings by a series of hooks called "hamuli".
Females typically have a special ovipositor for inserting eggs into hosts or otherwise inaccessible places. The ovipositor is often modified into a stinger. The young develop through complete metamorphosis ‚Äî that is, they have a worm-like larval stage and an inactive pupal stage before they mature (See holometabolism).
These are the sawflies, the most primitive Hymenoptera. Their adults do not have a narrow 'waist' between the thorax and abdomen. The female's ovipositor is adapted to burrowing or sawing into the substrate, usually plant tissue. 
These, the bees, wasps and ants, have a 'waist' between the thorax and abdomen. They are by far the most numerous Hymenoptera, and include the famous groups of colonial insects. In fact, the group with the most species is not colonial; it is the vast number of parasitoid wasps, such as the Ichneumons.
Hymenoptera originated in the Triassic: the oldest fossils belong to the Sawfly family Xyelidae. Social hymenopterans appeared during the Cretaceous.

<doc id="144917" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144917" title="Syrian American">
Syrian American

Syrian Americans are citizens of the United States of Syrian ancestry or nationality. This ethnic group includes first generation immigrants, and descendants of Syrians who immigrated to the United States. It is believed that Syrians first arrived in the United States in large number in 1880. Many of the earliest Syrian Americans settled in New York, Boston, and Detroit. Immigration from Syria to the United States was stopped for a long time after the United States Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1924, which made it difficult. 
More than forty years later, the Immigration Act of 1965, removed the quotas and immigration from Syria to the United States increased very much. It is estimated that 64,600 Syrians immigrated to the United States between 1961 and 2000.
Most of the Syrian immigrants to the US from 1880 to 1960 were Christian; a small minority were Jewish, Muslim Syrians arrived in the United States mostly after 1965. According to the United States 2000 Census, there were 142,897 Americans of Syrian ancestry, about 12% of the Arab population in the United States.
It is believed that the first Syrian immigrants arrived in the United States from Greater Syria in the 1880s and worked as peddlers, selling linen and other similar types of goods. Before 1920, the area now known as Syria was actually part of Greater Syria, an area which included the four modern countries of Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, and Syria itself. Most immigrants from the region were classified as "Syrian," even though they were not ethnic Syrian; some were even registered as Syrian Turks as Syria was under Ottoman rule for 400 years. This makes difficulties in trying to work out how many Syrians arrived in the early years.
Most of the early Syrian immigrants came from Christian villages around Mount Lebanon. According to historian Philip Hitti, approximately 90,000 "Syrians" arrived in the United States between 1899 and 1919. An estimated 1,000 official entries per year came from the governorates of Damascus and Aleppo, which are governorates in modern-day Syria, in the period between 1900 and 1916. Early immigrants settled mainly in northeastern United States, in the cities of New York City, Boston and Detroit and the Paterson, New Jersey area.
According to the United States 2000 Census, there are 142,897 Americans of Syrian ancestry living in the United States. New York City has the biggest concentration of Syrian Americans in the United States. Other urban areas, including Boston, Dearborn, New Orleans, Toledo, Cedar Rapids, and Houston have large Syrian populations. Syrian Americans are also numerous in Southern California (i.e. the Los Angeles and San Diego areas) and Arizona.
The first Syrian immigrants to the United States wore traditional clothing, this along with the fact that they tended to work as peddlers, led to some xenophobia. Dr. A. J. McLaughlin, the United States health officer at Marine Hospital, described Syrians as "parasites in their peddling habits." U.S. authorities claimed that Syrians had no right to become naturalized because they were Asian and did not belong to the white race. However, Syrians reacted quickly to assimilate fully into their new culture. Immigrants Anglicized their names, adopted the English language and common Christian denominations.
Syrians did not stay together in urban areas; many of the immigrants who had worked as peddlers were in contact with Americans on a daily basis. This helped them to absorb and learn the language and customs of their new homeland. Also military service during World War I and World War II helped assimilation. Assimilation of early Syrian immigrants was so successful that it has become difficult to recognize the ancestors of many families which have become completely Americanized.
After 1965 Immigration was mostly Muslim, and unlike their Christian counterparts they found it a bit harder assimilating because of their Islamic faith and the anti-assimilationist trend in America of the 1960s and 1970s. Also they are fond of their identity as Arabs, which might be a result of the bloom in multiculturalism to respect their Islamic religious customs and traditions in the United States. 
Syrians are mainly Arabic speakers. While some may speak the formal literary Arabic, many Syrians speak Syrian Arabic, a dialect which belongs to the Levantine Arabic family of dialects. There are also sub-dialects in Syrian Arabic; for example, people from Aleppo have a distinct accent, one that differs considerably from that of people from Homs or Al-Hasakah. Syrians can usually understand the dialects of most Arabs, especially those who speak any form of Levantine Arabic. 
Many old Syrian American families no longer speak Arabic because many parents do not teach their children Arabic. Newer immigrants, however, maintain their language traditions. The 2000 census shows that 79.9% of Syrian Americans speak English "very well". Throughout the United States, there are schools which offer Arabic language classes; there are also some Eastern Orthodox churches which hold Arabic services. Also to note Syria and Lebanon were briefly under French rule between 1918 and 1943 when they obtained independence, so many Syrian Americans are familiar with the French language.

Dipole antenna

The dipole antenna is one of the most important and commonly used type of radio antenna. It is widely used on its own. It is also used in many other radio antenna designs where it forms the radiating or driven element for the antenna.
The dipole antenna is made of two poles into which radio frequency current flows. This current and the voltage causes an electromagnetic or radio signal to be radiated. Being more specific, a dipole is usually an antenna that uses a resonant length of conductor. This conductor is cut so it can be connected to the what is sending the signal. For resonance, the length of the conductor is an odd number of half wavelengths long. In most cases a single half-wavelength is used.
The length of a dipole is very important for selecting the frequency that the antenna will work at. The antenna is an electrical half wavelength, or multiple of half wavelengths. This is not the same length as the wavelength for a signal travelling through air. There are a number of reasons for this. This means that an antenna will be a small amount shorter than the length calculated for a wave moving in air.
For a half wave dipole, the length for a wave moving in air is calculated. This number is multiplied by a factor "A". "A" is normally between 0.96 and 0.98. It is affected by the ratio of the length of the antenna to the thickness of the wire or tube used poles.
Dipole antennas are used for many different things. These include television antennas (commonly referred to as "rabbit ears"), shortwave radio antennas and whip antennas.

This would constitute the basis of an oppose for me, but you obviously "know" how edit articles already (which is why we look for high percentage namespace edits in the first place), so I'll make throughout checks of other factors before voting.

Analog signal processing

An analog signal processor is used to quickly process signals that can be too complex to handle any other way. A comparator is used to offer level triggers correct down to microvolts with reaction times in the picoseconds. Analog filters offer anti-aliasing in sampled value systems as inputs and outputs, and can be used as pre-filters in audio and communications. Analog multipliers and dividers are used to offer brief gain control, radiometric function, or continuous energy measurement, with surprising accuracy. Over-voltage protection applications can protect the front-end of analog transmission/receiver systems, multiplexers. Amplification and filtering for noise removal are the main feature of analog signal processing.

Delta Lea Goodrem (born 9 November 1984) is an Australian actress and singer. Her first single, "I Don't Care", charted as high as #64 on Australia's ARIA Singles Chart in 2001. In the following year, Goodrem took up the role of a schoolgirl named Nina Tucker in the Australian soap opera "Neighbours". This helped her into becoming a well known musician.
Goodrem was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in July 2003, for which she was treated.
Delta Goodrem released her second single "Born to Try" in 2002. It charted at #1 on the ARIA Singles Charts for one week. Her third single, "Lost Without You", was released in February 2003.

Kirchhoff's circuit laws

In 1845, German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff described two laws about electrical circuits..
These laws are generalizations of Ohm's law.
Kirchhoff's circuit laws are very useful in solving circuit problems.
Kirchhoff's current law is also known as Kirchhoff's first law and Kirchhoff's junction law.
This law states that 'The sum of current into a junction equals the sum of current out of the junction'.
This is the same as Kirchhoff's junction law. 
In a junction, the electric charge's sum preservation law is applied.
If the entering value of the current is i2 and i3, this current splits into the current of i1 and i4. Then the equation (i1 + i4 = i2 + i3) is satisfied.
The right picture gives an example.
This Kirchhoff's first law is that charge is not destroyed or created in a junction point.
This is based by an electric charge preservation law. 
Kirchhoff's voltage law is also known as Kirchhoff's second law, a closed circuit law, and Kirchhoff's loop law.
The algebraic sum of the voltage (potential) differences in any loop must equal zero.(This circuit is a closed circuit)
Any complex circuit can be divided into many closed circuits.
This law means that in the circuit there is an electric cell and electric resistance.
The electric cell gives the charge a electromotive force, and then the electric resistance dissipates this force.
But in electric resistance if the direction is opposite of the current's direction, this electric resistance adds to the electromotive force.
This Kirchhoff's second law is based on potential energy preservation law.

Peter Henlein

Peter Henlein (or Henle or Hele) (1479/1480 ‚Äì August 1542), was a locksmith and watchmaker from Nuremberg. He is often said to be the inventor of the watch. This is disputed. Henlein was certainly one of the first makers of the watch. Although many say that Henlein invented the mainspring, there are descriptions and two surviving examples show that spring driven clocks had already been made by the early 1400s. He did make improvements to the balance spring, which made it possible to make the watches smaller.
Around 1504 to 1508 Henlein did make a watch; a small, drum-shaped "Taschenuhr". It could run for forty hours before it needed rewinding. They were small enough to be worn around the neck, or carried in a bag or pocket. His watch only had an hour hand.

Cavity magnetron

The cavity magnetron is a high-powered vacuum tube that makes microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field. The 'resonant' cavity magnetron type of the earlier magnetron tube was invented by John Randall and Harry Boot in 1940. The high power of pulses from the cavity magnetron made centimetre-band radar practical. Shorter wavelength radars allowed the finding of smaller objects. The small cavity magnetron tube made the size of radar sets much smaller so that they could be put into in aircraft and ships used to find submarines. At present, cavity magnetrons are commonly used in microwave ovens and in various radar applications.

According to the Constitution, the President is chosen by the Electoral College to serve a five-year term. The electoral college is made up of the Senate, National Assembly, and the provincial assemblies.
The position of president in Pakistan has usually been one of a figurehead. That is with real power being given to the Prime Minister. However the power of the president has changed over the years, due to the military changing the role.
In 1947, Pakistan became a dominion and part of the British Commonwealth with the British Monarch as head of state, represented by the Governor-General of Pakistan. In 1956 Pakistan established its first constitution and became a Republic, and the Queen and Governor-General were replaced by the president.

Languages of Pakistan

English is the official language of Pakistan. Urdu is the national language despite not being a native language or being the mother tongue of any native group in the country. There are also provincial languages, Balochi language, Pashto, Saraiki, Sindhi and Punjabi, and one state language (Kashmiri language).
Pakistan is heir to one of the most ancient civilzations in the world along with Iraq and Egypt, and it is only to be expected that its languages, too, have ancient roots. These primary languages have not been used in the domains of power because the rulers of these regions were generally foreigners. But the foreigners, whether the Persians, Greeks, Arabs, Turco-Mongols as well as the British, have all enriched the indigenous languages so that their vocabulary is multilingual and varied. As the people of these areas converted to Islam, Arabic and Persian words influenced and became part of their identity, and remain so. In a sense, it is their very presence, as well as the Arabic-based scripts of all 75 Pakistani languages, which gave them a cultural unity. Linguistically, Pakistan faces two directions: India, because the roots of its languages are Dravidian as well as Indo-Aryan; and the Middle East, because its scripture and vocabulary owe very much so to Arabic and based on Farsi, for e.g. the national anthem is a highly Persianized form of Urdu.
other languages include burushaski, balti, domaaki , gawar-bati , Erina , shina and brahvi.

Empedocles

Empedocles was a Greek pre-Socratic philosopher and a person who lived in Agrigentum, a Greek colony in Sicily. 
Empedocles' philosophy is best known for being the origin of the cosmogenic theory of the four classical elements in the Western world. He also proposed powers called Love and Strife which would act as forces to bring about the mixture and separation of the elements. These physical speculations were part of a history of the universe which also dealt with the origin and development of life. 
Influenced by the Pythagoreans, he supported the doctrine of reincarnation. Empedocles is generally considered the last Greek philosopher to record his ideas in verse. Some of his work still survives today, more so than in the case of any other Presocratic philosopher. Empedocles' death was mythologized by ancient writers, and has been the subject of a number of literary treatments.

Forensic psychology

Forensic psychology is a branch of psychology which relates to the law. The main part of forensic psychology is working with the criminal justice system.
Forensic psychology is the use of psychological practices and principles and applying them to the legal system, mainly in court. In 1893 James McKeen Cattell at Columbia University was the first to research and study the psychology of testimony. 
The American Psychological Association Council of Representatives in 2001 recognized Forensic psychology as a specialty. A broad definition for forensic psychology includes two parts. The first part is to research human behavior that is and/or can be related to the legal process. The second is the use of psychological practice to consult on and within the legal system, including both criminal and civil law. 
The public part of a forensic psychologist‚Äôs time is spent in a courtroom working as a witness for the court. He or she answers questions based on interviews and discussions with people suspected of a crime. One aspect of the forensic psychologist is to give evidence as to the suspect‚Äôs ability to stand trial. Another is his or her thoughts about the accused's state of mind at the time of the offense. At sentencing, a forensic psychologist may give evidence of mitigating circumstances arising from the acuused's condition at the time.
Forensic psychology has some major roles in a court that bring psychology into a legal arena. The first is "malingering" a defendant is pretending to have a mental illness, or is lying to the court about his state of mind. A forensic psychologist keeps in mind that a defendant may have a mental disorder but also keeps in mind to watch for signs of deception, or errors in the defendant‚Äôs story. Another job of a forensic psychologist is to investigate the state of mind of the defendant at the time he or she committed the crime. Another is to see whether or not the defendant is able to be charged with the crimes due to his or her mental condition. Another job is to evaluate the defendant to see if he or she are able to be rehabilitated, or if they might commit the crime again. 
The branch of psychology known as Forensic psychology has been in existence for a little over 50 years. This branch of psychology has gone through many changes throughout the years.
These changes have been possible due to a development in different ways to assess psychological factors. These assessments are used in courtrooms in order to work to understand behaviors which are criminal or abnormal. These tests include but are not limited to: The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the Rorschach Ink Blot Test and The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. 
The ancient Greeks and Romans were the ones to first introduce the concept of insanity to the law. One of the first cases was Rex v. Arnold in 1723 in which Edward Arnold "Mad Ned" shot and injured Lord Onslow. As a result, Edward Arnold was found guilty and sentenced to death. But, Lord Onslow was not satisfied with this decision and said instead he should remain in prison for life. The judge ruled in his favor and that the behavior after the crime was admissible. This ruling set the stage for future trials to consider medical testimony and examinations performed after the crime. 
The Rorschach Ink Blot Test was developed in the 1930s by a man named Hermann Rorschach. With this test, subjects were shown an ambiguous blot of ink on a page and were asked to describe what they see. Based on the response of the subject, they are then evaluated using a scale which can then provide inferences about their personality characteristics as well as emotional functioning. Based on the contributions of this test, it has been used in multiple court proceedings including but not limited to criminal, civil, domestic, and quasi-legal.

<doc id="145200" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=145200" title="Opportunity cost">
Opportunity cost

Opportunity cost is the value of the next best thing you give up whenever you make a decision. It is "the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen". 
The idea of an opportunity cost was first begun by John Stuart Mill. The utility has to be more than the opportunity cost for it to be a good choice in economics.
For example, opportunity cost is how much leisure time we give up to work. Because leisure and income are both valued, we have to decide whether to work, or do what we want. Going to work implies more income but less leisure. Staying at home is more leisure yet less income.
Another example is deciding to stop work to go back to university. By choosing to go to university, your opportunity cost is losing your job and your pay check. Even though going back to university has a big opportunity cost, many people think it is a good decision because increased education gives you more job opportunities.

A nativity scene is a three-dimensional depiction of the Nativity of Jesus. It is also called a crib, manger, or cr√®che. Typically, a large scale scene includes the Holy Family, angels, the Magi, the ox and the donkey, and an assortment of shepherds, villagers, servants, and others.
There are two types of scenes: static representations of figures made of clay or other material and living scenes. Static scenes are often displayed on a table top in the home. In living scenes, humans and animals portray the characters in the scene. 
St. Francis of Assisi is said to have created the first nativity scene in 1223 (a "living" one) near Greccio, Italy. It was a "hit". The scene's popularity inspired communities throughout Catholic countries to stage similar scenes.
In the modern world, nativity scenes have provoked controversy. Animals are said to be abused in living scenes and objections have been placed against static scenes displayed on public lands. In addition, outdoor scenes are often the target of vandals. Theft or destruction of outdoor figures is not uncommon.

Static electricity

Static electricity means the increase of electric charge on the surface of objects. This electric charge remains on an object until it either flows into the ground, or loses its charge quickly by a discharge. Charge exchange can happen in conditions like when different objects are rubbed and separated. A static charge will only remain when one of the surfaces has a high resistance to electrical flow. The effects of static electricity are familiar to most people because they can see, feel and even hear the spark. This spark happens when the excess charge is neutralized. This neutralization occurs when excess charge flows into an electrical conductor (for example a path to ground). Other charge flow occurs when a charged object is near a region with an excess charge of the opposite polarity (positive or negative). The familiar phenomenon of a static 'shock' is caused by the neutralization of charge.
In Greek age, Thales found static electricity when he was cleaning his amber. But at that time, they did not pay attention to this and research it. They just knew that rubbing something made a pulling force. Earnest research into static electricity was started in the 17th century, when Otto von Guericke made the first friction generator. And in the 18th century, Coulomb started research into a fixed quantity of static electricity. Benjamin Franklin associated static electricity with storms. In 1832 Michael Faraday published the results of his experiment on the identity of electricities. This report proved that the electricity made by using a magnet, voltaic electricity produced by a battery, and static electricity are all the same. Since Faraday's result, the history of static electricity can be thought as the study of electricity in general.
Many situations can cause static electricity.
Static discharge is excess charge that is neutralized by a flow of charges from or to the surroundings. Positive charges get 
electrons from the surroundings, and negative charges lose their electrons to the surroundings.
The feeling of a static electric shock is caused by the stimulation of nerves as the neutralizing current flows through the human body. Due to the presence of much water in the body, the charge is generally not enough to cause a dangerously high current. Lightning is also an example of static discharge. A cloud gets a very huge charge by clashing with other clouds. It gives off the excess charge to the ground. But this huge charge never occurs in the human's surroundings naturally, unless he is struck by the lightning.
Despite the apparently harmless nature of static electricity, there can be significant risks in research, because a large charge can break down the equipment.

Modular arithmetic

Modular arithmetic, sometimes also called clock arithmetic, is a way of doing arithmetic with integers. Much like hours on a clock, which repeat every twelve hours, once the numbers reach a certain value, called the "modulus", they go back to zero.
People talked about modular arithmetic in many ancient cultures. For instance, the Chinese remainder theorem is many centuries old. The modern notation and exact definition of modular arithmetic were first described by Carl Friedrich Gauss.
Modular arithmetic can be used to show the idea of congruence. Two integers, "a" and "b", are congruent modulo n if they have the same remainder when both are divided by the positive integer "n". Congruence can be written this way:
The number "n" is called the modulus. Another definition of congruence, that means the same thing but is sometimes more useful, is that the two integers are congruent modulo n if the difference ("a" - "b") is an integer multiple of "n". That is, if "n" is a factor of ("a" - "b"), then "a" and "b" are congruent mod "n".
For example:
The remainder when 32 is divided by 7 is 4, and the remainder when 11 is divided by 7 is also 4. This tell us they're congruent, mod 7.
We can use this example it with the other definition too. The difference, ("a" - "b"), is 32 - 11 = 21. This shows the two numbers are congruent because 21 = 3 * 7, and 7 is a factor of 21.
Modular arithmetic is useful in many fields, such as cryptography, computer science, and music. It is often used in calculating checksums and check digits.

I know I'm not the only user who is sick and tired of the bot-like IP Pakistan editor. He is a regular contributor, but he has never created any account to my knowledge; he creates POV articles, full of red links to non-notable topics, and worst of all, he's started adding dead images. He's never commented on a talk page, despite having numerous blocks, and numerous editors trying to communicate. Eptalon has, unlike me, assumed that the editor will get better with time. I strongly disagree anything will change. If this was one logged-in user, he'd have a block log a mile long, and we should really be considering a ban, and revert/remove any edits this user makes. Frankly, we'll be much better off without his biased, badly formatted articles on non-notable Pakistan-related topics. 17:30, 25 November 2008 (UTC)
I believe the point of this is that hes creating an unnecessary amount of work here. Everything he does needs to be fixed. Previously I was opposed to blocking but its getting out of hand at this point and something needs to be done. 17:49, 25 November 2008 (UTC)
edit conflict: Yes, the IP's s/he edits from in the 92.x.xxx.xxx range are in Manchester. I don't think the user deserves a block. For one thing, much of the material on Wikipedia about Pakistan is contributed by this editor, and I think that this is of high value to the Encyclopedia. Although some of the behavior exhibited by the user is not very favorable (no communication with other editors), I think that blocking him will be ineffective (as he can switch IP addresses) and wrong (just because the editor's poorly-formatted articles give editors a task to do, doesn't mean the edits are bad). POV material should not be deleted, but kept and maybe an Indian point of view or something should be added. I think an encyclopedia cannot be completely without point of view, and that it should cover many sides. "Minority" viewpoints should have a brief mention as well, if they have been published. As for the dead images, they were probably in articles copied from Enwiki, and can be removed.
The image inclusion is probably the insertion of an image he saw at enwiki, and he is probably learning how to include images. Give this editor some time. "Poorly formatted" does not mean that the content is useless. It just gives you something to do. As for "non-notable", not all his topics are non-notable (many have articles on Enwiki).
I am not sure whether 92.0.0.0/12 is Pahari Sahib or 212 or 195. They may all be different people. It is likely that Pahari Sahib is either 212 or 195, as he seems capable of communicating with other users. But I know little about the case, so I'm not an authoritative source or anything on who the Pakistan editor is. 
To Matilda: You, in all the time you have contributed to Wikipedia, should know that content copied from English Wikipedia to another Wikipedia does not violate copyright, as Wikipedia is a free content encyclopedia. If the content was copied from another website, then it was probably a Wikipedia scraper site (like NationMaster). 20:06, 25 November 2008 (UTC)
That article was probably taken from Wikipedia itself, and not from Jalal's Pages. Jalal may have copied it on his webpage, or the Pakistan Editor may have unknowingly copied it from Wikipedia, assuming it was free, which makes Sisiqui the plagiarist. 20:51, 25 November 2008 (UTC)
Recently the Pakistan IP is editing under and a new problem is that he keeps and copying-'n'-pasting from EN, using unsimple English and making redirects with uncommon spellings. Although his editing has improved, I'm afraid he still hasn't learnt his main lesson, that is, he keeps running unapproved 'bots' under IPs to escape blocks deliberately. I also warned one of his other IPs many weeks ago to include references when writing about people, and even now, he "still" hasn't. - 23:54, 28 November 2008 (UTC)
There seems to be agreement here that this person is more trouble than they're worth. I shall be continuing my block on sight practice here. I hope other admins follow this practice, before this wiki is destroyed by POV copyvio articles on non-notable Pakistan topics. 00:14, 29 November 2008 (UTC)
Matilda: We should take the educational approach, trying to get this editor to communicate with us. Since you clearly do not advocate that practice, and instead want to go on about petty nonsense like NPOV that has no basis in reality, you should not involve yourself in this sensitive case. You do not take an approach that negotiates with the editor, and you seem to think that if he doesn't respond to the warnings, then he should be blocked. This is just another reason that I would not trust you as an administrator, knowing that you want this editor blocked. The editor clearly has trouble with something, either the language being used to communicate with him is too complex, or someone told him not to "chat" or "talk" to anybody, but just to complete the assignment (and then when the assignment was done, he just kept that in mind and thought to always follow that rule), or he works for some organization and doesn't know anything about Wikipedia. He might just learn differently. No matter what, the last thing we should do is block. 
As for plagiarism and copyright violations, try to contact the owner of the website and ask if the editor has permission to reproduce the work.
To Eptalon: A consortium is like an association, a federation of organizations, or a group of people.
I recommend that an editor who speaks Urdu to try to talk to this editor, and see if that works. Right now, I do not know of an editor on Simple Wikipedia that speaks it. 00:51, 1 December 2008 (UTC)
The 195 IP addresses geolocate to JANET CSIRT: http://ja.net/services/csirt
Please also see: 
If the material was copied from Enwiki, but it happened not to have belonged here either, then it should be deleted. That still doesn't make the Pak editor a plagiarist. To consider copies from enwiki of perfectly legitimate material plagiarism is unnecessary rules-following, in my opinion. I do, however, think material should be simplified if it was copied from Enwiki. That is our job.
Our focus should not be following the rules no matter what. If the rules get in the way of our primary objective, which is to get him to communicate with us and to learn, then we are not obligated to follow them, unless they are law. For instance, the NPOV thing. Your focus on rules and rules only (not the primary objective of education) is the "go[ing] on about petty nonsense" thing. 
We should not template warn him. That is the issue that I have with AErn fatsoen. All he does is template warn and consider everything that doesn't fit the typical Wikipedia mold to be vandalism. The educational approach is not to warn with templates. 
Neutral Point of View is an afterthought. I don't care about it. It is not our focus in this case. 
Synergy: Don't do that. That's not ethical. We are not English Wikipedia, Czarist Russia, or any other institution that practices such unjust practices. 02:29, 1 December 2008 (UTC)
As some of you may know I recently had a with about my sig being too long. While it fit the 3 line limit in my of but not in her's (or ). So I changed it as many of you know so it complies. My point being the and I quote: "signatures that take up more than two or three lines in the edit window clutter the page and make it harder to distinguish posts from signatures," I personally think we need to set a standard screen res so we don't keep running into that problem. I would say about . Opinions please.--¬† ¬† 06:13, 26 November 2008 (UTC)
Hello there. Is there anyne interested in reogranising the Mormonism-related subjects into a consisted hierarchy? - My personal opionion:
This seems to hold for the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (our article here is ill-named), and the biggest Mormon group. The second-biggest movement, Community of Christ seems to be pretty close to mainline Protestant Christianity - they have a trinitarian view, they don't see the Book of Mormon as scripture (and their baptism is accepted as a Christian one). I am not qualified to write sucvh an article, but I think following this discovery, our Mormonism related articles need rewriting. Anyone up to the task? -- () 11:43, 26 November 2008 (UTC)
I went ahead and asked of to see if they can help. To avoid cross posting, I'd rather discuss it there. -- 11:09, 30 November 2008 (UTC)
Hi simple wikipedia, I have over the past few months written a web app that translates -to some degree- regular English to simple English automatically, intending to help with the development of this wikipedia.</br>
The main part of the program right now is a list of 2000 simple word substitutions, which can be seen (and improved) .
Im aware of the challenges and limitations in the automated treatment of the English language and I have made this program in a careful way. I address this here. The program makes no changes to Links, quotes, or references, is not intended as a substitute for human edits, though I have considered trying to fork it into a bot in some form.
Soon I hope to involve word disambiguity, and dependent clause repair. I could use some help here, msg me, its o/s.
Is this a useful program? really, or what. tell me what you think, Because it was sort of annoying to make, and I think its a good idea. </br>
Cheers () 17:22, 26 November 2008 (UTC)
yep! its sure got its bugs. it'll be flyin by christmas. it'll be a bot by valentines. much love simple.wikipedia-- () 02:04, 1 December 2008 (UTC)
I refer to this edit by Gwib with the edit summary "ENWP template of the same name has it. Accepted by some as anatomically correct, so should have a link. Disagree? I thought so. Simple Talk?" which reinserts the article Gr√§fenberg spot into the and thereby claims that the concept is an anatomical fact. Per our article "a fact is something that is true or real". 
We provide three reliable references to support the fact that "Doctors who specialise in the anatomy of women say there is no anatomical evidence for the "spot"." The authors of the book who popularised the concept were psychologists, a nurse and a sex counsellor - not experts in the field of anatomy. 
As per our policy at : "many things most people believe are wrong - agreeing is not truth. Facts must be checked." Popular belief does not make something true. Some people believe in a Flat Earth. Others believe in Creationism. We have articles on the topic but we do not put forward the idea that they are true. I do not believe we should inaccurately promulgate the "modern gynecologic myth" by claiming something as anatomy when it is yet to be proven to the satisfaction of medical science. 
Note there is nor reason for inaccuracies at enwp to be reproduced here - we are not a mirror of enwp. -- () 21:40, 26 November 2008 (UTC)
Does anyone think that this Wiki degrades the English language? Aren't we assuming that English speakers aren't intelligent enough to cope with sophisticated language? Sorry if I'm right off, I'm new here. () 00:42, 27 November 2008 (UTC)

Hey everyone, I think we should move Simple News from to . After all, it's part of wikipedia, and it will make it easier for users to find it. 16:17, 29 November 2008 (UTC)

I was thinking today, that our tag needs updating to look more like en's. It needs to have a place to put the link the material came from. Can anyone do this? I think an admin has to. ¬† 14:28, 30 November 2008 (UTC)
Back to the original topic... :P - I've fixed the template so the third field should work. Go and play in a sandbox! - 17:35, 1 December 2008 (UTC)
I wanted to bring this up to the community before someone added it, but I noticed someone a long time ago removed the "other simple wikis" from . I think it should be reinstated because every other simple wiki has it and it makes navigation easier. What does everyone think? ¬† 14:46, 30 November 2008 (UTC)
Fixed. Space is no longer an issue. I had someone fix it so if its too large, you have the option to hide it. This will let us see edits faster for vandal fighting and you don't "have to" hide it. 17:30, 30 November 2008 (UTC)
I'm concerned lately that a number of new accounts have been repeatedly creating in mass, complex jargon without any basic, decriptive words whatsoever, meaningless stuff, spam, or just nothing at all. They usurp pages to put their complex irrelevant terms as in . They have been warned way too much by me, and they mass create 'throw-away' accounts and sometimes use IPs, which has been going on since Saturday. According to their IPs, they're in Korea, and possibly a university or a company judging by their edits. These users have varying degrees in understanding English, so I suspect they're meats. They also add summaries like "now ing" They've made mostly very obscure articles about car technologies and circuitry, like:
These accounts:
have all been doing this today. If anyone knows anything about this, why they are doing this, or anything about them happening now, just say it. I'm tired of QDing after them. I'll clear the contrib and user lists everyday so latest reports won't be clogged. And if you need to see past reports, go to - 06:45, 1 December 2008 (UTC)
I think now that they belong to Korea University and their teacher is 'Prof. Dr. Ki-Su LEE' and their website is www.korea.ac.kr. I'm trying to contact them about this, because one user I've kindly asked, has failed to respond and they are still ruining Wikipedia. If this continues, someone might have to pull in a few blocks. They are getting more suspicious by the moment and are now starting to use more IPs to possibly evade blocks.
They just don't learn how to edit properly and they think copying from En and other sites is the easy way out. - 06:07, 3 December 2008 (UTC)
√Ü√•m F√¶ts√∏n removed this section with the edit summary "rm Multiple accounts... section, no activity but i'll bring it back if it pops up again." I've restored it, because I think we should stick to good Wiki-practices, which includes not deleting discussions except when archiving them. ‚Äî Cheers, 14:26, 6 December 2008 (UTC)

Simple English wikipedia is not only for people learning English. I know it says that it is for children too but it seems like it is more geared toward foreigners from my reading of the summary. I think you should think again about your summary of this wiki. I am sure others will agree that most people learning English read in their own language as most of my foreign friends do. To say they cannot read in their own language is nonsense there are so many languages covered here bar one or two.(BTW I am an adult who understands English fine, but I have foreign friends so I have a fair knowledge of this subject.)

Hello everyone. I thought I would let you all know that I will be less active from next week (8th December). I have a new job which will be taking up more of my time. Right now I work at a reception desk, so when there is no customers, I have no work to do, so I browse wikipedia. Unfortunately, my new job has a lot more responsibilty. I will be a housing officer, getting tenants to pay their rent and evicting those who don't. So I will not be able to browse here much after next week, as I will be out on home visits and in interviews. I will still try to be active at the weekends though, and will occasionally pop in when it is quiet too! Regards, 09:58, 2 December 2008 (UTC)
Lol, couldn't resist the title!
Anyway, just to update you all!
I've recently been inactive due to exams and personal reasons (and also something else some people know about that is wiki related) so DYK? has not been too active.
I am now back, and I completed an update yesterday. I've also now worked through all current noms, and added some to the next. I aim to get an update about every three days, although sometimes this may mean that I self-nom-self-approve or slightly relax the criteria (shout if you object).
I'm also looking for more people to help out, both with noms and the actual reviewing and updating! If you want to help, add your name to and if you're unsure of what to do, . I'm also going to refresh that list periodically so that only those active are listed.
Finally, a question: there has been talk of protecting everything that is Main Paged. As it is, DYK is run by mainly non-admins, and indeed I would struggle with doing it if it was protected ;). So, a) should it be protected (there has been no vandalism yet) and b) if it is, would anyone be opposed to be requesting sysop early for the sole purpose of DYK and Main Page updating? I would then re-apply when I felt I was ready for the rest ;).
So, that should bring you up to speed ;).
Thanks,
Has WP:RFD died? Cause I listed something for deletion two days ago and only 2 people have shared their thoughts. Why?--¬† ¬† 00:33, 3 December 2008 (UTC)

Hi everyone. I think it would be a good idea to have the wikicup after all because I think it would make , and other things (wikiprojects, GA/VGA) more active. I "however" would like to participate, and was wondering if anyone would like to be a judge. If nobody wants to within 3 or 4 days, I'll be the judge (and won't participate, against my will!). I would be happy to write the rule and scoring system. Thanks, 18:21, 7 December 2008 (UTC)
I don't know how to make bots, obviously, but I need one created and we have to discuss this change (possibly). I noticed on A Tale of Two Cities that there were two wikiquote links. My first proposal is that we only use a wiktionary, wikibooks (or source; what have you) or wikiquote link if there is not one available on simplewq, simplewiktionary, etc. My next proposal is that a bot be created to update this, just like iw links. Thoughts? 23:45, 9 December 2008 (UTC)
Looking at the ShockingHawk unblock/mentor section, a major problem cropped up. "Did You Know?" is a part of our main page. This is a part of the public face we present to all of our readers and speaks heavily for us. This page should be something to be proud of and it is a page we should well protect. There in lies an issue. 
DYK hooks are included on the page. They should be properly inspected and verified well before being accepted.
Total time: 1 hour and 12 minutes
This hook went from nomination to being archived and queued up for inclusion on the Main Page in a total of 74 minutes. In less than an hour and a half, we are making changes to the main page with only the input of a single voice. There was practically no chance for anyone to have any opinion against this being made a part of our main page. 
The quality of any one hook is not the issue. This may be a great hook and it may deserve it place on the Main Page, but the fact it, only one person had a chance to decide if this was the case before this nomination got swept under the rug and archived. Ample time needs to be provided to give anyone reasonable time to voice their opinion. No one should be prevented from discussing a matter as important as our main page just because it was brought up and archived while they were running out to grab a bite to eat. Time frames need to be set. Two to three days is not forever when it comes to thing like this. We take a week to decide to delete a non-blatant page and yet it take an hour to decide to alter the main page and archive the "discussion".. I do not see this as a good thing. -- 08:32, 10 December 2008 (UTC)
Hi, some questions above ( Should we Project Space the Wikicup?
Should it be advertised, and if so, where? (Recent Changes, SiteNotice, Main Page, Watchlist has all been suggested)) Haven't been adressed. Could someone please comment, as there are only 3 weeks to go before it starts! Thanks. 12:15, 10 December 2008 (UTC)
Hi, again. I have another point I want to discuss. The scoring on the wikicup. This is what put an end to it last time. Do you think the scoring system is alright? Thanks, 15:49, 10 December 2008 (UTC)
Hi, I have just indefinitely blocked FastReverter as a sock of as per check on his IRC nick. A checkuser may check this and unblock if appropriate though, he has confessed on IRC that it is him...-- 22:01, 9 December 2008 (UTC)
I'll mentor Static under preconditions. I would like to see who will oppose or support this request, as its in good faith. I'll wait until we have a formal discussion or there is reasonable opposition to act. I believe you all know that if he steps out of line, he will be blocked again (and I have no problem doing it myself). I would like to give this one last shot. 22:21, 9 December 2008 (UTC)
Creol, you just contradicted yourself. In the last part, of the first sentence you say you can not ::see how any change has occurred yet go on to prove yourself wrong by saying he showed improvement with this new account. Well, I saw this improvement and I set aside all of my past dislikes of the Static and was became willing to give it one more go. If he turns out to be the same Static in a week I'll reblock indef and we do not even need to hold a discussion. It'll be wasting my time, and not the communities. And as Samekh notes, we will have to deal with the socks, or reform him. And this is what its about. 20:16, 10 December 2008 (UTC)
@Shapiros10, yes he may've done, but he's promised to change. It's a issue, as there are no "punishments" on WP, only preventative measures. ¬†() 22:29, 9 December 2008 (UTC)

Tropicana Field

Tropicana Field is a domed baseball stadium that serves as the home field for the Tampa Bay Rays since 1998. The stadium was opened in 1990 in hopes of snatching a team away from another city. Two teams almost moved to Tampa to call Tropicana Field home; they were the Chicago White Sox and the San Francisco Giants. They stadium also served as the former home for the NHL team, Tampa Bay Lightning and the former home for the AFL's Tampa Bay Storm. Current Rays manager, Joe Maddon, has nicknamed the stadium "The Pit". While the fans nicknamed it "The Trop". The former name of the stadium was the Florida Suncoast Dome. It has also been called the Thunderdome.

Gentoo penguin

The gentoo penguin ("Pygoscelis papua") is a species of penguin easily recognized by the white stripe across its head. They are the largest penguins of the stiff-tailed family, which also makes them the largest penguin except the two giant penguins, the emperor penguin and the king penguin.
The gentoo penguin is, on average, 5 kilograms in weight and 80 centimeters in height, but can range from 8.5¬†kg to 4.5¬†kg and 51 to 91¬†cm. They have very large male reproductive organs, and are also the fastest at swimming underwater among the penguins, reaching speeds of 36¬†kilometers per hour.
Gentoo penguins generally live on Antarctic islands, with their largest colony on the Falkland Islands. There are approximately 320,000 breeding pairs of gentoo penguins.
These penguins nest on the ground, making nests of stones, sticks, grass, feathers, and various other materials. They usually lay two eggs by mid-October, which hatch in about 34 days, and put equal care into caring for either chick. Young chicks remain in the nest for 3 to 4 weeks until their second down feathers grow in, during which their parents hunt for food in order to feed them. Afterward, they leave the nest but remain in the colony in groups of chicks, called creches that free their parents to hunt for food for them.
Gentoo penguin pairs often stay together for a long period of time.
Gentoo penguins usually eat crustaceans, such as krill, but genrally eat what is easiest to get. At sea, they may be under attack from sea lions, leopard seals, and orcas. While on land they have no natural predators, but skua, gulls, and other birds of prey have been known to attack and eat young chicks and eggs.

Megabat

Megabats are also called Old World fruit bats. They are the suborder Megachiroptera, family Pteropodidae of the order Chiroptera (bats).
These fruit bats are flying mammals that live in dense forests in Africa, Europe, Australia, and Asia. There are about 166 species of fruit bats. Fruit bats are sometimes known as flying foxes. These bats live in huge colonies, known as "camps." These nocturnal (most active at night) animals rest during the day while hanging upside down from their feet. 
As fruit bats fly from plant to plant getting food, they also pollinate the plants they visit. In addition, they disperse the plants' seeds as they eat. Many plants, including some avocados, dates, mangos, and peaches, are dependent on these bats for either pollination or seed dispersal.
Fruit bats mostly eat fruit juice and flower nectar. They chew the fruit, then spit out the seeds, peel, and pulp. Fruit bats, like other Megachiropteran bats, use the sense of smell to find their food, fruit and/or nectar. Although they have large eyes and can see well, fruit bats do not use sight as their primary sense. Fruit bats eat other things too.
Some megabats are vectors of dangerous diseases.
The first recorded human outbreak of Ebola virus was in 1976, but the source of the virus is still unknown. Recent tests have shown that some species of fruit bats collected during Ebola outbreaks show the bats have the virus, but do not show any signs of it. Further studies also show that Ebola can reproduce in fruit bats and other bats in the "Tadarida" genus. This could mean that the bats are the source of the virus. The Marburg virus, which is related to Ebola, has also been found in fruit bats in Uganda.
Another explanation is that fruit bats could be an intermediate host because of the uncertainty that fruit bats are the index case for Ebola. It is also important to note that certain species of fruit bats in Africa are immune to the Ebola virus and that their DNA or RNA are similar to the Zaire Ebola virus. This could explain the spread to humans since people in that region tend to eat fruit bats.

Gray whale

The gray whale ("Eschrichtius robustus") is a baleen whale (a filter feeder) that has a layer of blubber up to 10 inches (25 cm) thick. Because a mother gray whale would defend her calf so fiercely it would actually attack whalers and overturn their boats, whalers often called the gray whale a devilfish. 
The gray whale migrates from cold waters to the tropics each year in pods. Gray whales are very agile swimmers. They can dive for up to 30 minutes and go 500 feet (155 m) deep. Gray whales make grunts, clicks, and whistling sounds which may be used to communicate with other gray whales.
This giant cetacean eats small fish, crustaceans, squid, and other tiny organisms that it finds on the sea floor. It sieves its food through its comb-like plates of baleen.
Compared to most baleen whales, gray whales are rather small, growing to be only about 45 feet long. They are easy to see with their gray color, which is actually more charcoal black than it is gray. Gray whales have lots of barnacles and lice on their skin. However, scientists say the lice and barnacles do not harm the whale, and it is possible they may actually "help" the whale by feeding off of dead skin, which the whale needs to get rid of.
Whales prefer one fin over the other, just like humans are right-handed or left-handed. It is possible to see whether a gray whale is left-fineed or right-finned. The fin that has least barnacles is the fin it uses most. This is because the whale likes to dive down to the ocean floor to up huge amounts of sand from the bottom, filtering out small prey animals that live in it. When the whale does this, many of the barnacles on the side that rubbed along the bottom are scraped off. So, whichever side has fewest barnacles is the side the whale prefers to use when it digs up sand.
Gray whales make a really long migration from the Arctic Ocean (northwest of Alaska) to the coast of Mexico, and back each year. They travel about 20,000 km (~12,500 miles) each year, staying near the coast. They feed in the cold Arctic waters and calve and mate in the warm, protected tropical lagoons of the Pacific Ocean off Mexico.

<doc id="145556" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=145556" title="Basking shark">
Basking shark

The Basking shark ("Cetorhinus maximus") is a huge filter-feeding shark, which can grow up to the length of 40 feet (12 metres). It is the second largest shark in the world (after the Whale shark). The Basking shark is also called the Sunfish, the Bone shark, the Elephant shark, the Sailfish shark, and the Big mouth shark.
The Basking shark is one of the most recognizable species of all sharks. Its large size and extended gill slits which nearly encircle the head and caudal fin together, helps distinguish it from all other species. It has a snout which is in the shape of a cone, and it has many large gill rakers made for filter feeding. Its enormous mouth extends past the small eyes and contains many small, hooked teeth. The Basking shark has a very large liver that makes up to 25% of its body weight. The liver is high in squalene, a low-density hydrocarbon that helps the shark float and not sink.
The dorsal surface of the Basking shark is mainly a greyish-brown colour, but can range from dark grey to almost black. The underside is usually the same colour, but is often paler and more whiter.
The Basking shark has many hundreds of tiny teeth. Those teeth which are in the center of the jaws are low and triangular while those on the sides are more cone-shaped and slightly recurved. There is mainly a wide space on the center of the upper jaw which only has scattered teeth. 
The Basking shark is the second largest shark in the world, only to be behind the Whale shark. The Basking shark can reach lengths of up to 40 feet (12 metres), but the average adult length is 22‚Äì29 feet (6.6-8.7 m). The size at birth is believed to be between 5‚Äì6 feet (1.5-1.8 metres). The Basking shark is an extremely slow-growing species and may grow to 16‚Äì20 feet (4.8‚Äì6 metres) before becoming mature.
The Basking shark is a coastal-pelagic species, found throughout the world's arctic and temperate waters. In the western Atlantic, it ranges from Newfoundland to Florida, and southern Brazil to Argentina. In the eastern Atlantic it ranges from Iceland and Norway to Senegal, including the parts of the Mediterranean. In the western Pacific, it is found off Japan, China and the Koreas as well as western and southern Australia and the coastlines of New Zealand. In the eastern Pacific, it is found from the Gulf of Alaska to the Gulf of California and from Ecuador to Chile.
Basking sharks are usually found travelling in pairs or groups of up to 100 or more, but are sometimes seen travelling alone. It is not fully understood why they have such a different behaviour to other shark species, as they seem to travel alone and in groups. They are highly migrational, and in the winter months they will be harder to find as they go to the deeper parts of the water to find food.
When they are seen swimming in circles, it is believed that this is to get the attention of females for mating. They may spend hours performing this, just in order to get noticed. They are usually very patient when it comes to attracting a mate.
Along with the Whale shark and the Megamouth shark, the Basking shark is one of three species of large, filter-feeding sharks. However, the Basking shark is the only one that relies on the flow of water through its pharynx by swimming. The Basking shark is usually seen swimming with its mouth wide open, taking in a continuous flow of water. Food is strained from the water by gill rakers in the gill slits. The Basking shark's gill rakers can strain up to 2000 tons of water per hour. These sharks feed along areas that contain high densities of large zooplankton (i.e., small crustaceans, invertebrate larvae, and fish eggs and larvae). There is a theory that the Basking shark feeds on the surface when plankton is common, then sheds its gill rakers and hibernates in deeper water during winter. Also, it has been suggested that the Basking shark turns to benthic (near bottom) feeding when it loses its gill rakers. It is not known how often it sheds these gill rakers or how quickly they are replaced.
Basking sharks are ovoviviparous, meaning that the young embryos develop in a yolk sac inside of the female, but they aren‚Äôt attached to a placental connection. It is believed that the females can delay gestation so that they may remain pregnant from 1 to 3 years. Mating occurs in the early summer and the females often move to very shallow water when ready for the young to be born. She may have up to 6 pups that are up to 6 feet long. The age of maturity is from 6 to 13 years. Basking sharks start mating when they are around 15 to 20 feet long.
Basking sharks are highly migratory. Off the Atlantic coast of North America, it appears in the southern part of its range (North Carolina to New York) in the spring, shifts northward (New England and Canada) in the summer, and disappears in autumn and winter. Off the southwest coast of the United Kingdom, in the northeast Atlantic, the Basking shark feeds at the surface of coastal waters during the summer. These sharks are absent from November to March, suggesting a migration beyond the continental shelf during the winter months. This is explained by the high amount of zooplankton (the main food of the Basking shark) that exists in these waters during late spring and early summer. During migration, Basking sharks form groups depending on size and gender.
Many people have witnessed individual Basking sharks leaping from the water. This behaviour is not fully understood, but some believe that the shark may be trying to get rid of parasites or commensals such as remoras and sea lampreys, which are often seen attached to the skin of the Basking shark. The lamprey cannot cut through the denticle-armored skin, but they may be enough of an irritant to cause a reaction like jumping or rubbing against an object to get rid of them. The cookiecutter shark has also been known to attack Basking sharks by using its suction cup-like lips and muscular pharynx to drill off pieces of flesh on the outside of the shark.
The Basking shark has been hunted for its large liver, which has been sold in Japan, and has been burned and used in lamps by fishermen in the U.K, whilst the oil has been used in the manufacture of cosmetics. Due to the long amount of time it takes to mature, and the slow reproductive rate, the Basking shark is vulnerable to over-fishing, and targeted populations are very slow to recover from targeted fisheries. Today the biggest threat comes from the demand for the fins for shark fin soup, and from accidental by-catches in the fishing industries. Although it is difficult to tell exactly, there has been a report that the population of Basking sharks has decreased by 80% since 1950.

Fortress

A fortress is a building designed to be defended, which means it was very hard for enemies to get inside. Fortification kept the people inside safe. There is little difference between a fortress and a castle. Fortresses normally have thick stone walls, thicker but less tall than in castles so artillery cannot break them. There were very small windows, without glass, so that soldiers inside could fire out through them. As time passed, the weapons they used changed, from bow and arrow, crossbow, gun or cannon. Soldiers outside had great difficulty firing into such small windows. The people defending the fortress were also able to drop things like rocks and boiling oil on the heads of those below. Successful attacks were usually sieges. 
Fortresses were not designed for comfort. They were dark and often damp. The Tower of London is an example of a fortress.

Fin whale

The fin whale ("Balaenoptera physalus") is a huge baleen whale. It is the second largest animal on Earth (the blue whale is the biggest). This whale is sometimes called the "greyhound of the sea" because of its fast swimming speed; it can swim up to 23¬†mph (37¬†km/hr) in short bursts. The fin whale is also called the finback, finner, razorback, common rorqual, and herring whale.
The fin whale is a streamlined whale that is found worldwide; it is most common in the North Atlantic. There are three separate populations of fin whales, one in the North Pacific, one in the North Atlantic, and one in the Southern Hemisphere; they do not interbreed. Many groups of fin whales migrate between feeding grounds and breeding grounds. This whale usually swims in pods of 3-7 whales but larger groups (up to 300 animals) may form at rich feeding grounds.
Fin whales are filter feeders that eat plankton (tiny crustaceans like krill and copepods) and small fish from the water. They have very fine grey-black baleen that traps very small particles of food. Each side of the upper jaw has 270-470 baleen plates.

James Skinner (soldier)

James Skinner CB (1778 ‚Äì December 4, 1841) was an Anglo-Indian military adventurer in India.
Skinner was born in India, son of Lieutenant-Colonel Hercules Skinner and a Rajput lady. Because of his Indian heritage, Skinner was unable to serve as an officer in the East India Company army and, at the age of eighteen, he entered the Mahratta army under Beno√Æt de Boigne, where he soon showed military talent. He remained in the same service under Pierre Cuillier-Perron until 1803, when, on the outbreak of the second Anglo-Maratha War all Anglo-Indians were dismissed from Mahratta service.

<doc id="145696" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=145696" title="Hurricane Nora (1997)">
Hurricane Nora (1997)

Hurricane Nora was the first hurricane to cause a significant danger to the Continental United States since Kathleen in 1976. 
Part of a tropical wave that contributed to the formation of Hurricane Erika in the Atlantic moved into the Pacific and organized into Tropical Depression 16-E on September 16 and Tropical Storm Nora that same day. Nora became a hurricane in a favourable environment September 18 while moving northwest. Its motion then stalled over an upwelling of cooler water that weakened it.
On September 20, Nora again started moving. It reached its peak intensity of 115 knots and 950 mb On September 21 and 22 it moved over the wake of Hurricane Linda. This weakened the storm pack down to a Category 1.
During this time, a trough developed that turned Nora to the northeast. This carried Nora over a favourable environment and towards Baja California. After restrengthening slightly, Nora made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane near Punta Eugenia and again south of San Fernando, both times as a hurricane.
Nora stayed a tropical storm as it moved into the United States. Yuma reported sustained gale-force winds. Rains were heavy, sometimes exceeding the "annual" rainfall for the area. Nora weakened to a depression while over California, and it dissipated September 26.
Nora killed two people in Mexico. One was killed by a downed power line in Mexicali, and the other was a scuba diving in underwater currents. No one in the United States was directly killed by Nora. However, the California Highway Patrol attributed several traffic accident deaths to the weather.
There was extensive damage to areas hit by Nora. Waves ruined dozens of homes. Roughly 350 to 400 people were left homeless in San Felipe, and winds uprooted trees and peeled roofs from homes in Puerto Pe√±asco.
In the United States, thousands were left without power in California and Arizona, and 16 telephone poles were downed in Seeley. Streets flooded in San Diego, Indio, El Centro, and Palm Springs. A remnant circulation continued aloft, and damaged trees and three homes in Utah. Total damages were "several hundred million dollars", as well as 40 million dollars to lemon trees.
Nora crossed an area of abnormally warm water near the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula. It restrengthened slightly before making its first landfall near Bah√≠a Tortugas, Baja California Sur. When Nora was inland, the area of the storm located in the Gulf of California began to reintensify. Hurricane Nora then made a second landfall about 60¬†miles (95¬†km) south-southeast of San Fernando, Baja California.
At landfall, a trough was accelerating Nora northwards, causing it to reach a forward speed of 30¬†mph (50¬†km/h). Late on September 25 (UTC), still a tropical storm, it entered the continental United States at the California-Arizona state line. Nora began to weaken rapidly, and was downgraded to a tropical depression three hours later, while located between Blythe and Needles, California. Nora reached Arizona while still tropical, becoming the third known system to do so. Nora degenerated over land, and the low-level center moved towards the north-northeast. A remnant circulation aloft persisted, however, and was likely responsible for a period of near hurricane-force winds observed at the NWS Cedar City, Utah Doppler weather radar. The remnants gradually became more diffuse over the following two days while moving generally northeastward, through portions of Utah, Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming.
On September 24, Arizona Governor Jane Dee Hull activated an emergency response center to prepare the state's response to the flash flooding the storm would cause on the dry desert floor, and Yuma residents began to fill approximately 55,000 sandbags to contain the possible flooding. Hull also activated the state's National Guard, and sent drinking water and electric generators to Yuma. Farther inland, the National Weather Service issued flash flood watches for western Arizona, southeastern California, southwestern Colorado, southern Nevada and southern Utah on September 26.
In the United States, there were no direct deaths blamed on the hurricane. However, the California Highway Patrol attributed three or four traffic fatalities in southern California to the weather.
Damage totals in the United States are not fully known, although media summaries of Nora included a loss to agriculture preliminarily estimated at several hundred million dollars, and at least one study places the figure at $150‚Äì200¬†million (1997 USD). It is estimated that $30‚Äì40¬†million (1997¬†USD) in damage to lemon trees occurred. Although Nora was significantly weakened, near hurricane-force winds were observed at the Dixie National Forest in southwestern Utah, where strong gusts sheared off the tops of large trees.
The Yuma radar indicated a small area of rainfall totals along the northern Gulf of California coast of Baja California. In the United States, the largest total rainfall was recorded at the Harquahala Mountains in Arizona, where of rainfall were recorded as a result of Nora, causing flash floods in western Arizona.
Near Phoenix, rainfall from the storm caused the Narrows Dam, a small earthen dam, to fail. In other locations in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah, more than occurred in a few localized areas, sometimes with precipitation comparable to the entire local yearly average rainfall. Flooding was also reported in Somerton, San Diego, El Centro, Palm Springs and Indio, while 12,000¬†people lost power in Yuma, as well as Los Angeles and southwestern Utah.
Despite the damage, the World Meteorological Organization did not retire the name "Nora" during its meeting in the spring of 1998. As a result, it was used in the 2003 Pacific hurricane season and is on the list of names to be used in 2009.

Hurricane Dog was the strongest hurricane in the 1950 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the fourth named storm of the season. Dog began on August 30 to the east of Antigua. After passing through the northern Lesser Antilles, the storm turned to the north and became a Category 5 hurricane. Dog reached its highest strength of 185¬†mph (295¬†km/h) winds over the ocean. The hurricane weakened and passed within 200¬†miles (320¬†km) of Cape Cod before becoming extratropical on September 12.
Hurricane Dog caused high damage to the Leeward Islands, and was said to be the strongest hurricane on record in Antigua. Many buildings were destroyed or damaged on the island. In the United States, the hurricane caused damage along the coast. It damaged several boats and caused 11 people to drown. Strong winds caused large power outages across southeastern New England. Damage along Hurricane Dog's track totaled to about $3¬†million (1950¬†USD, $25.7¬†million 2007¬†USD).

Chess boxing

Chess boxing is a mixed sport which puts together the sport of boxing with games of chess in every other round. Chess boxing fights have been done since early 2003. The sport was started when Dutch artist Iepe Rubingh, given the idea by a similar sport in the writing of Enki Bilal, started actual matches. The sport has become more well known since then. To do well at chess boxing, players must be both good chess players and good boxers.
A match between two players is made up of up to eleven rounds of boxing and chess sessions, starting with a four-minute chess round followed by two minutes of boxing and so on. Between rounds there is a one-minute pause, during which the players change their gear. The form of chess played is speed chess in which each player has a total of twelve minutes for the whole game. Players may win by knocking out the other player, checkmate, a judge's choice, or if the other player runs out of chess time. If a player does not make a move in the round of chess, he will be given a warning by the referee and he must then make a move in the next 10 seconds.
The idea was started in 1992 by cartoonist Enki Bilal, and a match of chess boxing was a big story part of his graphic novel "Froid √âquateur". Iepe Rubingh, a Dutch artist, was took the idea from Bilal's book and started the sport in the spring of 2001. Rubingh decided that the method of play in the book, a boxing match with a chess match after, was not very good. Rubingh made the rules so a round of chess would come after a round of boxing.
The World Chess Boxing Organisation (WCBO), keeps control of the sport. The first world championship was in Amsterdam in 2003 and was won by Iepe Rubingh, the starter of the sport. The First European Chess Boxing Championship took place in Berlin on October 1, 2005 when Tihomir Atanassov Dovramadjiev of Bulgaria beat Andreas D'Schneider of Germany after D'Schneider gave up in the seventh round.
In April 2008, the World Chess Federation, FIDE, posted a video on its website in which its president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov played a friendly chess boxing match in Elista. Also in April 2008 the UK's first Chess Boxing club was started in London by Great Britain Chess Boxing Organisation founder Tim Woolgar. In July 2008 in Berlin, a 19-year old Russian mathematics student Nikolai Sazhin won the title of "World Champion" in chess boxing by beating Frank Stoldt. Stoldt resigned in the 5th round after losing his queen.

Hi everyone, in this article I'm going to talk to you about my wikiproject about France. First of all, it need expanding somewhat, and you can help to do that!
"If you didn't know", France is a country in Europe and it's population is just over 60 million.
However, on Simple English Wikipedia, lots of articles about it are missing. I have myself started to write the Communes of France but there are over 30,000 left. I have also written all the missing departments of France; they need expanding! And concerning french rivers, or mountains, or cantons, or arrondissements, there are hardly any written at all! There are also many articles concerning French literature that need to be written.
As you can see, there is a lot of work to do, lots of articles to write, to boost your Mainspace edits, and make "Simple English Wikipedia" better!
So what are you waiting for, and start editing!

Boorowa, New South Wales

Boorowa is a small town in New South Wales. It is from Yass. The town is built on the banks of the Boorowa River, which flows into the Lachlan River. The town was first called "Burrowa". Boorowa and Burrowa are Aboriginal words in the Wiradjuri language meaning "birds". In 2008, there were 1350 living in Boorowa.
The first people to live in the area were the Wiraduri people. This was one of the largest tribes in New South Wales. They had several regular camping sites along the Lachlan and Boorowa Rivers. It is estimated that there were several thousand Wiradjuri people at the time of European settlement. A survey in 1851 showed that there were only 300 people left. Local Wiradjuri people were forced onto government reserves at Rye Park and Edgerton.
It is not known for sure who the first European explorers were in this area. Hamilton Hume and his neighbour, William Broughton, had explored the Yass area in 1821. They may have gone farther towards the Lachlan. Broughton had one of the first farms on the Boorowa River in 1828. By 1849, he had of land in the area. Other early settlers were James Hassall in 1827. His family already had large farms at Cowra by 1823. His brother Tom Hassal, a clergyman and his wife Ann Marsden (daughter of Reverend Samuel Marsden) and other family members were given land in 1831. There was a law at the time which gave free land to the children of clergy.
Many of the settlers in Boorowa were from Ireland and the town shows their influence. Two early settlers in the 1820s were cousins, Roger Corcoran and Ned Ryan. They had been sent to Australia as convicts. Saint Patrick's Church, built in 1877 has a huge stained glass window brought from Ireland in 1881. It shows Daniel O'Connell (1775-1847) the "Liberator of Ireland." The oldest building still standing in Boorowa is Shamrock Cottage, built in 1850, once the home of the owner of the Queens Arms Hotel.
There are many old buildings still standing in Boorowa. Webb and Crego's store, built in 1862, was robbed by bushranger Ben Hall in 1863. The Royal Hotel, built in 1860, is still a hotel although it is now called the Ram and Stallion Hotel. The Court House, built in 1884, is now an information centre for tourists.

Europen settlers moved into the area in 1827. The first farm in the area was Marengo Station, 1833, owned by John Scarr. By 1840 there were about 40 people living in the area. When the town was laid out by the surveyors in 1849, they called the town Murringo. It has also been called Meringo, Marringa, Maringa, Muringo, Maringo and Marengo. In 1926 the town was officially called Murringo. In 1864, Ben Hall robbed John Scarr and his brother as they rode along the road to Burrowa.
The original plans included a market place, a big cemetery and large parks. When gold was found nearby at Lambing Flat in 1860, most of the people moved to the goldfields. Although there were only about 120 people living in the town, the people saved money and built the Christ Church Anglican Church in 1866. The foundation stone for the Sacred Heart Catholic Church was laid in 1871. A post office opened in 1857.
A number of historic buildings are still standing in Murringo.

Binalong, New South Wales

Binalong (postcode: 2584, ) is a small town in New South Wales, Australia. It is 37 km north-west of Yass. 
The Aboriginal people who lived in the area were part of the Ngunnawal people. The first Europen to visit the area was Hamilton Hume in 1821. The name of the town is believed to come from either an Aboriginal word meaning 'towards a high place' or from 'Bennelong', the name of a famous Aborigine.
Binalong was outside the legal limits of European settlement in New South Wales. However farmers settled in the area before the law changed to allow settlement in 1839. From 1847 there was a police camp at Binalong and a court. The old Cobb and Co inn was built at that time as a staging post for Cobb and Co coaches.
The town was officially listed in 1850. It was an important stop on the way for people going to look for gold at Lambing Flat. The school was started in 1861. Gold also meant that there were bushrangers in the area. The grave of John Gilbert is near the town in the field where the police kept their horses. He was a member of Frank Gardiner's gang and later Ben Hall's gang. He was shot dead by police in 1865. 
The first railway station opened in 1875. The railway arrived in 1876. The current building was put up when the railway line was moved in 1916. The station and the signal box are now closed.

George Butterworth

George Butterworth (born London, 12 July 1885; died Pozi√®res, France, 5 August 1916) was an English composer. He showed great talent as a young man and might have become one of England‚Äôs greatest composers if he had lived longer. He was killed while fighting in World War I. He is best known for a group of songs which are settings of poems by A. E. Housman.
Butterworth was born in London. His father was a solicitor who later became the general manager of the North Eastern Railway. The family moved to Yorkshire soon after George‚Äôs birth. He had his first music lessons from his mother, who was a singer, He soon started to compose music. His father wanted him to be a solicitor and so he sent his son to Eton College. From there he went to Trinity College, Oxford. At Oxford he became more and more involved with music, especially after he met the folk song collector Cecil Sharp and composer and folk song enthusiast Ralph Vaughan Williams. Butterworth and Vaughan Williams made several trips into the English countryside to collect folk songs. Both of them were influenced by English folk songs when they were composing. Butterworth was also a very good folk dancer. He was particularly fond of Morris dancing.
Vaughan Williams and Butterworth became close friends. It was Butterworth who said to Vaughan Williams that it would be a good idea to turn the symphonic poem he was working on into his "London Symphony". When the manuscript for that piece was lost in the post Butterworth and two other musicians helped Vaughan Williams to write it out again. Vaughan Williams dedicated the piece to Butterworth's memory after his death. When he left Oxford, Butterworth became a music critic for "The Times" as well as composing and teaching at Radley College, Oxfordshire. He also studied at the Royal College of Music for a short time, working with people such as Hubert Parry and Charles Villiers Stanford. 
Although Butterworth had lots of work he often felt that his life had no purpose. When World War I broke out, Butterworth felt that he could be useful so he joined the British Army. He was killed by a sniper in 1916 at Pozi√®res leading a raid during the Battle of the Somme. His body was not found, and his name appears on the Thiepval memorial, near the site of the Somme. He was awarded the Military Cross, and a trench was named after him.
Butterworth did not write a great deal of music, and during the war he destroyed many of his compositions that he thought were not good enough. Of those that survive, his works based on A. E. Housman's collection of poems "A Shropshire Lad" are the best known. Many English composers of Butterworth's time set Housman's poetry, including Ralph Vaughan Williams.
Butterworth wrote two song cycles on Housman's poems. They include some of the best-loved English songs of the 20th century, especially "Is My Team Ploughing?" and "Loveliest of Trees". He used this last song as the basis for his 1912 orchestral rhapsody, also called "A Shropshire Lad". It is full of soft, tender music as well as passion.

Charles Villiers Stanford

Sir Charles Villiers Stanford (born Dublin, 30 September 1852; died London, 29 March 1924) was an Irish composer who lived in England for most of his life. 
Stanford was born in Dublin. His father was a very successful lawyer who was also interested in music. He played the cello and sang. Stanford‚Äôs mother played the piano. The young boy heard a lot of music at his home as there were often visitors who came to make music. Charles studied the piano, organ and composition and was composing and performing at concerts when he was still very young.
His parents had wanted their son to be a lawyer, but it was obvious that music was to be his profession. He won a scholarship to Queens' College, Cambridge in 1870 where he was a choral scholar. He learned very quickly and in 1873, while he was still a student, he was made organist of Trinity College and conductor of two choirs. While he had these jobs he was given time to make visits to Germany where he studied with Carl Reinecke and Friedrich Kiel. He met several famous composers including Brahms and Offenbach. He went to the opening of the Bayreuth Festival Theatre where the music of Richard Wagner was performed.
Stanford took his BA degree in 1874 and MA in 1878, and was given the honorary degree of D.Mus. at Oxford in 1883 and at Cambridge in 1888. He had a lot of energy and was known for working very hard. When the Royal College of Music opened in London in 1883 Stanford was made professor there. He became conductor of the Bach Choir and then he was made professor of music at Cambridge. He was still only 35 years old. He kept these two professorships until his death. Although he gave up his job as organist at Trinity he became conductor of the Leeds Triennial Festival and appeared with nearly every important British music festival. In 1902 he was knighted.
Stanford married in 1878 and the couple had two children.
Stanford died in London and was buried in Westminster Abbey.
Stanford is best known today for the choral music he wrote for the Anglican church. These includes some very fine anthems and motets as well as service settings. His music was much better than most of the church music that had been composed during the 19th century, so he helped to make British music better. He composed many pieces for music festivals: these include oratorios and cantatas as well as partsongs and solo songs. He also wrote a lot of orchestral and instrumental works. These often show the influence of Brahms and Schumann.
As a teacher of composition Stanford had a great deal of influence on many British composers. He sometimes had a bad temper, but he was also very good at showing students how they could improve their music. Composers such as Charles Wood, Constant Lambert, Vaughan Williams, Holst, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Rutland Boughton, John Ireland, Frank Bridge, George Butterworth, Arthur Bliss, Herbert Howells, Arthur Benjamin and Ernest J. Moeran all learned a great deal from him, and continued to admire him.

Professional wrestling has accrued a considerable amount of slang, in-references and jargon. Much of it stems from the industry's origins in the days of carnivals, and the slang itself is often referred to as "carny talk." Often wrestlers used this lingo in the presence of fans so as not to reveal the worked nature of the business. In recent years, widespread wrestling discussion on the Internet popularized the terms.

Nitrous oxide is a gas with the chemical formula NO. It is found naturally in the air. It is also made artificially, because it has many uses. It is a very strong greenhouse gas (almost 300 times more so than carbon dioxide). Because it is a greenhouse gas, people are trying to use it less. 
Nitrous oxide is used by doctors and dentists to reduce pain. In the body, it makes people feel happy. For this reason it is also called "laughing gas". It is sometimes used "only" to feel happy, like an illegal drug.
Nitrous oxide is used in high performance cars to increase the power of their engines. When it is used this way, it is usually called "nitrous" or "NOS". 
Nitrous oxide can also be used in aerosol spray cans, especially for foods like whipped cream. This is because it has a sweet taste and is not toxic, and also makes the whipped cream more fluffy.

Oryx

The Oryx (also called the sabre antelope) is a fast-running hoofed mammal that lives in dry regions of Africa and Asia (including the Arabian peninsula). They inhabit steppes (sparse grasslands), semi-deserts, and deserts.
These antelopes congregate in herds of 8 to 60 oryx. Newborn calves can run with the herd within minutes of their birth. Oryxes have a life span of about 20 years.
Some people think that the unicorn of legend was based upon the oryx.
Many types of oryxes (including the Arabian oryx and the scimitar-horned oryx) are endangered species, mostly because of overhunting and disease. 
The Oryx is an herbivore (a plant-eater). It eats grasses, shrubs and roots, spending most of its time grazing. Oryx are ruminants; they swallow their food without chewing it. After a while, they regurgitate a partly-digested "cud" which they chew and then swallow for the last time.
This desert animal can go for weeks without water; it gets much of its water from the plants it eats.

The standard shape for pyrohy is oblong with tapering ends, but rectangular or circular pyrohy are also common. They can be closed or open-faced with no crust on top (like a tart).
The filling for pyrohy may be sweet and contain cottage cheese, or fruits like apple, plums or various berries. Savory versions may consist of meat, fish, mushrooms, cabbage, buckwheat groats or potato. In Ukrainian and Russian cuisines, pyrohy with a savory filling are traditionally served (like pirozhki) together with borscht, or soup.

It was first founded in 1448 by Margaret of Anjou (the Queen of Henry VI), and refounded in 1465 by Elizabeth Woodville (the Queen of Edward IV). This is why the name of the college is spelt Queens' and not Queen's: it was founded by two queens. 
The "President's Lodge" of Queens' is the oldest building on the river at Cambridge, dating from about 1460.
The college is on both sides of the river Cam. A bridge joins the two parts. This bridge is always called the "Mathematical Bridge". The students call the older part of the college "The Dark Side" and the newer part "The Light Side".
Many people take photographs of the college. There is a story that the bridge was designed and built by Sir Isaac Newton without the use of nuts or bolts. The story says that once some students tried to take the bridge apart and put it back together again, but were unable to do so. That is why they had to put nuts and bolts in which can be seen today. The story is not true. The bridge was built in 1749, after Newton had died. It was never taken apart although it was rebuilt twice.

A scholarship is financial help (money) given to someone who wants to study. Scholarships can be given by schools or by universities or colleges or any other institution where people can study or where research needs to be done. It is similar to a bursary.
There are very many kinds of scholarships. Some scholarships will cover all the tuition fees (money that the student needs to pay to study), others may just help towards the tuition fees. Some scholarships may include money for other things such as food and accommodation.
Sometimes the students are expected to do something in return for having a scholarship. They may, for example, be expected to do some particular work after they finish their studies, or they may need to help the institution in some way. Quite often the amount of money a student gets will depend on how much money the family has.
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women says that scholarship must be equally given for girls without discrimination.

The Leeds Triennial Festival was a festival of music held in the town of Leeds, Yorkshire in England. The festival started in the 19th century at a time when very large choirs were in fashion. Although there is now no festival called the Leeds Triennial Festival the town of Leeds continues to put on music festivals.
On 7 September 1858 Queen Victoria opened the new Town Hall in Leeds. It was a very large building, big enough for an audience of 4000 and a choir of 400 singers. The composer Sterndale Bennett conducted an orchestra and choir at the opening performance.
Although ‚Äútriennial‚Äù means something that happens every three years, the next festival did not happen until 1874. In 1880 the first festival called the Leeds Triennial Festival was conducted by Arthur Sullivan. These festivals were very famous internationally because a lot of famous composers were asked to write new works for choir and to come and conduct them. Composers such as Raff, Dvorak, Massenet, Humperdinck, Parry, Stanford, Elgar and Sullivan himself all wrote new works for the festival.
Later in the 20th century many famous musicians continued to be associated with the festival including Benjamin Britten and Aaron Copland.
Although the last Leeds Triennial Festival took place in 1985 both the Festival Chorus and the Leeds Philharmonic Chorus continue to perform at the Leeds International Concert Season in the Town Hall.

Trimeresurus trigonocephalus

The Trimeresurus trigonocephalus, commonly known as the ""Sri Lankan Green Pit viper", is a species of venomous Pit vipers found in Sri Lanka. There are no subspecies currently recognized.
Males are smaller than females who can grow to the length of around 130¬†cm, while males can grow up to the length of 80¬†cm. They are green in color, and their back has some shades of yellow, they also have black stripes all over them and have a black tail.
The Sri Lankan Green Pit viper is nocturnal and arboreal (it lives in trees), but can sometimes be found on the ground looking for food like frogs, lizards, and small mammals, it also eats birds which it finds in the trees. In the morning Sri Lankan Green Pit vipers can be seen on top of trees so they can warm up their body with the sun rays that hit them.
The Sri Lankan Green Pit viper is viviparous, meaning they give live birth. They give birth to their young during June and July. The have around 5 to 25 young at a time.
They are found in grasslands and rain forests of Sri Lanka
The Sri Lankan Green Pit viper is also known as the "Pala Polonga" and the "Green Pit viper"".
The venom of the Sri Lankan Green Pit viper is hemotoxic. The bite of a Sri Lakan Green Pit viper is very painful, when someone is bitten by a Sri Lankan Green Pit viper the bitten area swells up, and the pain may last for a few days. The cells of living tissue die, blisters occur, and ptosis and lymphadenopathy take place. However, there have been no reports on deaths.

Ernest Moeran

Ernest Moeran (born Heston, Middlesex, England, 31 December 1894; died 1 December 1950) was an English composer.
Moeran (pronounce: ‚ÄúMOOR-an‚Äù) was born in Heston, to the west of London. His father was an Irish clergyman. Ernest spent most of his childhood living on the coast of Norfolk. He learned to play the violin and the piano. At first he was taught at home by a governess. When he was ten he went to school. In 1908, he went to Uppingham School where he spent five years. When he left school in 1913 he started to study piano and composition at the Royal College of Music with Charles Villiers Stanford.
Moeran‚Äôs studies at the Royal College of Music were interrupted after 18 months because of the start of World War I. He joined the army as a despatch rider but he was soon badly injured in the head and could no longer fight in the army. After the war he did some music teaching, but then he started to study music again. His teacher this time was John Ireland who had been a pupil of Moeran‚Äôs earlier teacher Stanford.
After these studies his music started to be performed a lot. His "First Rhapsody" for orchestra was performed several times, including in 1924 by the Hall√© Orchestra conducted by Hamilton Harty. He was asked to compose a symphony for the Hall√© Orchestra, but he preferred to write shorter pieces, especially chamber music and piano music. In 1931 he wrote a "String Trio" which is one of his best works. 
Moeran became interested in folk music. He liked to go to country pubs and listen to the people singing there. He collected about 150 folk songs in Norfolk and Suffolk and made many arrangements of them.
By the mid-1920s, Moeran had become close friends with Peter Warlock. They lived together and often went out drinking together. Moeran gradually became an alcoholic.
In 1945, after Warlock had died, Moeran married the cellist Peers Coetmore. The marriage was not very happy although it helped Moeran to compose some of his best pieces: the "Cello Concerto" and "Cello Sonata".
Moeran was found drowned in the River Kenmare. At first people thought he had committed suicide but then it was found that he had had a heart attack and died before he fell into the water.
Moeran‚Äôs music is influenced by folk song. His harmonies are often like those of Delius. He was also influenced by Vaughan Williams, Holst, Bax, John Ireland and Peter Warlock. For many years he concentrated on piano music, songs and chamber music, but in his later years he wrote larger works such as the Symphony in G minor (1934-7) and his Concertos for the Violin and the Cello.

Despatch rider

A despatch rider is someone in the army who delivers messages ("despatch" or "dispatch" means "to send someone or something off on a journey"). A despatch rider either rides a horse or a motorcycle.
Despatch riders were used by armies to send messages between headquarters and the fighting soldiers. They might be delivering reports, but sometimes they took urgent messages which were often secret. It was a very dangerous job. Travelling between the lines of fighting armies the despatch rider could easily be blown up by a mine, shot by gunfire, or captured by the enemy.
Despatch riders always used to ride on horseback. In the 20th century they usually rode motorcycles. They were used a lot in World War I and even in World War II, although by the end of World War II electronic communications had improved so that despatch riders were rarer.

<doc id="146185" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146185" title="Holography">
Holography

Holography is a method that uses the wave character of light, which depicts an exact description that goes beyond the options of the classic photography. A "hologram" is a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture made from a laser. When a person looking at it moves, the hologram changes slightly with the movement to make it look as if the picture was 3-D.
Holograms are made with light that is flashed onto the scene, then something to write or draw the hologram on, almost like how photos are made. To make a hologram and not a photo, some of the light (a "reference beam") has to go right onto the thing that the hologram is being written on. The light has to be a laser because lasers are more accurate and have a wavelength that doesn't change, like the wavelength of other light sources like lightbulbs do. To stop other light from messing the hologram up, holograms are usually taken in the darkness.
Holograms might be easier to explain if compared to photos. In contrast to photography, holography not only records the intensity of light, but also its difference of phase. All pieces of information reflected by the object, are recorded.
In holography you basically work with two (rather three) waves, the so called reference wave (that goes on to the plate) and the exposure wave (object wave(which comes from the object)). With the reference wave it is possible to save the phase information in the form of a light-dark model on a film. The object wave and reference wave must have the same wave length in order to save the phase information.
The most famous person linked to the history of holography is the physician Dennis G√°bor, the inventor of the hologram.
In fact his discovery in 1947, which demonstrated the highlight of a long development, was not supposed to display three-dimensional objects, but to improve the resolving capacity of microscopes.
For a hologram you need a laser beam, that gets enlarged by a dispersing lens and goes through a semi penetrable mirror. Only a piece of this laser beam goes through the mirror. Then this beam becomes the reference wave which is recorded on the film. The other piece of the laser beam will be reflected on the mirror and runs as the so called exposure wave at the object.The object reflects this wave on the film.
The process of creating a hologram is nearly identical to photography through diverse chemicals.
To look at a hologram just recorded, you have to light the film with the reference wave. These waves are reflected on the film (hologram) and create (within the proper angle of sight) a virtual picture of the recorded object.
Nowadays industries use holograms more often to measure. In the automotive engineering the autobody is measured by holography techniques for bulges and vibration characteristics. An example of this method is the phase-shift-method. 
First you take a hologram from the ground level state of the object, then overload the object through heat or mechanical pressure. By covering the original hologram and the modified hologram, interference fringes occur. These interference fringes can be evaluated quantitatively and give information about the deformation. So you can measure tiny terminal expansions or vibrations in mechanical systems. Therefore you need two reference waves that are shifted to each other.
There are holographic storages for analog pictures and digital data. Digital information will be affiliated by a two-dimensional bit-pattern.

Dirty paper coding

In telecommunications, dirty paper coding (DPC) is a good way to send digital data through a channel that is subject to some interference that is known to the sender. The sender does precoding of the data so as to cancel the effect of the interference.
Costa asked the following question:
When Costa asked his question, the Shannon‚ÄìHartley theorem (and the more general noisy-channel coding theorem) was well known.
The Shannon‚ÄìHartley theorem tells us that, all else being equal, a paper sent along a path that picks up less dirt can reliably deliver more information than another paper sent along a path that picks up more dirt.
People have also thought up many ways of dealing with such dirt added after the message is written‚Äîsee error detection and correction for details.
Most people expected that the same thing would happen when dirt is added to the paper before the message was written‚Äîthe more dirt, the less information can be reliably sent.
In 1983, Costa showed the surprising result that we can send just as much information on such a dirty piece of paper as we can when writing on a clean sheet of paper, and gave a way to get that capacity.
A dirty paper code is a way for the writer to adapt his message to the dirt already on the paper.
The writer and the reader agree ahead of time on which dirty paper code they will use for the messages.
People have thought up several dirty paper codes, including Costa precoding (1983), Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (1971) and the vector perturbation technique of Hochwald et al. (2005).
A similar problem called "writing on dirty tape (WDT)" is more complicated.
As of 2005, the capacity computation problem and the capacity-achieving
problem for writing on dirty tape are unsolved
"Writing on wet paper" is a related problem in steganography
In a wireless network, often a transmitter has many different messages, and each one needs to be sent to a different person.
The sum-rate capacity of a system that transmits all the messages at the same time‚Äîand uses dirty-paper codes to reduce the interference between messages‚Äîcan be many times the sum-rate capacity of a similar system that only sends one message at a time (TDMA).
Any one receiver is only concerned with the messages for that receiver‚Äîall the other messages the transmitter is simultaneously sending to everyone else are‚Äîto that receiver‚Äîirrelevant noise that only interferes with the desired message.
The "dirty paper" story can be seen as a parable for wireless communication.
Recently, there has been interest in DPC as a possible solution to optimize the efficiency of wireless networks, in particular multiuser MIMO networks and into an interference aware coding technique for dynamic wireless networks.
People doing "informed digital watermarking" use dirty paper codes, using this analogy:

John Key

John Phillip Key (born 9 August 1961) is the 38th and current Prime Minister of New Zealand and leader of the New Zealand National Party.
John Key entered the New Zealand Parliament in 2002 representing the north-west Auckland area of Helensville as a National MP, a seat that he still holds. In 2006 he succeeded Don Brash as the National Party leader in 2006. Key led his party to victory in the November 2008 general election.
On 5 December 2016, Key resigned as prime minister and as party leader. Bill English soon replaced Key as prime minister and party leader.
Key was born in Auckland, New Zealand, to George Key and Ruth Key. His father, who was from the UK, died of a heart attack in 1967. Key and his two sisters were raised in a state house in Christchurch by his mother.
He attended Burnside High School, and earned a Bachelor of Commerce degree in accounting from the University of Canterbury in 1981. He has attended management studies courses at Harvard University, although he did not receive a degree from this institution.
Key met his wife Bronagh when they were both students at Burnside High School. They married in 1984. She is currently full-time mother of their two children, Stephie and Max.
In 1995, he joined Merrill Lynch as head of Asian foreign exchange in Singapore. That same year he was promoted to Merrill's global head of foreign exchange, based in London, where he may have earned around US$2.25 million a year including bonuses, which is about NZ$5 million at 2001 exchange rates. Some co-workers called him "the smiling assassin" for maintaining his usual cheerfulness while sacking dozens (some say hundreds) of staff after heavy losses from the 1998 Russian financial crisis. He was a member of the Foreign Exchange Committee of the New York Federal Reserve Bank from 1999 to 2001.
Key became Prime Minister following the general election on 8 November 2008 which ended the Labour-led government of nine years under Helen Clark. The National Party, promoting a policy of "change", won 45% of the party vote and 59 of the 122 seats in Parliament, a big margin over the Labour Party which won 43 seats.
Key was sworn in as Prime Minister on 19 November 2008 along with his new cabinet. His first international outing as Prime Minister was the 20th APEC meeting in Peru the following day.
Key announced he will step down from the role of Prime Minister and leader of the National Party effective 12 December 2016.

Peter Warlock

Peter Warlock (born London, 30 October 1894; died London, 17 December 1930), was an English composer. ‚ÄúPeter Warlock‚Äù was not his real name. His real name was Philip Heseltine. He was also a music critic. When he wrote about music he used his real name, but when he composed music he used the pseudonym (borrowed name) "Peter Warlock", which is the name by which he is usually remembered today.
Philip Heseltine did not come from a musical family. When he was two years old his father died. His mother married again and went back to live in Wales, where she came from. Philip went to school at Eton College.
He was still a teenager when he was introduced to the composer Delius, who lived in France. They became good friends and Philip made piano arrangements of some of Delius‚Äôs music. Later he wrote a book about Delius. He studied in Germany for a time, and then at Oxford where he studied classics. He learned about music by teaching himself. He did not fight in World War I. He was a conscientious objector, but also, his health was not good enough for him to be in the army.
He spent most of his life in London, but he did visit Ireland for a year, and also spent three years with his mother in Wales, and four years in Kent where he lived with Ernest Moeran. Heseltine and Moeran often got drunk together. He became friends with the composer Bernard van Dieren whose music influenced him a lot. He also liked poetry from the time of Queen Elizabeth I.
He died in his apartment from gas poisoning. It is not certain whether it was suicide, but he did let his cat out before he turned on the gas.
His music, written under the name of Peter Warlock, often has links with his literary writings. Some of the best works he wrote are his songs, especially the song-cycle "The Curlew", which has lyrics from poems by W. B. Yeats. One of his most popular works is the "Capriol Suite" for string orchestra.
Warlock wrote many carols, such as "Adam Lay Ybounden", "Tyrley Tyrlow", and "Bethlehem Down".
Warlock was not influenced by folksong like many other English composers of the time. He liked many different styles, including Renaissance music and the music of Bart√≥k whom he met.

A land mine (sometimes just called a "mine") is a weapon that is put on the ground or just underneath the ground so that it explodes when a person or vehicle goes by. They are called "mines" because people who put them there dig a hole in the ground (like miners who dig for coal etc.). Many people can be killed by mines, including innocent people. Sometimes mines can lie in the ground for years after a war has ended and people get killed or badly injured.
There are different types of land mines. Anti-vehicle mines are against vehicles. Infantry mines are used against foot soldiers.

Charles Wood (born Armagh, 15 June 1866; died Cambridge, 12 July 1926) was an Irish composer and teacher.
Charles Wood was born in Armagh, Ireland. His father sang in the Cathedral choir. Charles had music lessons from the cathedral organist, then he went to the Royal College of Music where he studied composition with C.V.Stanford and Hubert Parry. He also learned to play the horn and piano. After four years he went to Selwyn College, Cambridge, at first to study, then to teach harmony and counterpoint. In 1889 he got a teaching job at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. Soon he became their first Director of Music and Organist. When Stanford died, Wood became Professor of Music at Cambridge.
Wood is mainly remembered today for his Anglican church music. He wrote music for the Communion Service and service settings of the Magnificat and Nunc dimittis. These are often sung today in cathedrals and churches. He wrote many fine anthems including "O thou, the central orb". In Cambridge he is remembered for the chimes he wrote for the clocks of Gonville and Caius College.
His pupils included Ralph Vaughan Williams at Cambridge and Herbert Howells at the Royal College of Music.

Arthur Bliss

Sir Arthur Bliss CH KCVO (London, 2 August 1891; died London, 27 March 1975) was a British composer (a person who writes music). When he started composing, his music sounded very modern and harsh. As he got older he changed his style and wrote more Romantic music in the style of English composer Edward Elgar. For more than twenty years he was Master of the Queen's Music.
His father was American, his mother was English. He went to school at Rugby. He went to Cambridge University where he studied with Irish composer Charles Wood. Wood also taught the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams. Bliss got to know Elgar whose music influenced him very much.
For a short time he learned music from Charles Villiers Stanford at the Royal College of Music. During World War I he served in the army. 
After the war he started to play his music in public. These compositions show the influence of Stravinsky, Ravel and Les Six. His music even sounded jazzy. After a few years his music became more Romantic. Elgar asked him to write something for the Three Choirs Festival in 1922. The piece he composed was his "Colour Symphony" in which he tries to describe colours in music.
During the 1920s his music became more traditional. He wrote a lot of music for movies including music for the movie "Things to Come" (H.G.Wells). He loved the theatre and composed music for the ballets "Checkmate" and "Miracle in the Gorbals". One of his best works is the choral symphony "Morning Heroes" (1930). This was written to remember those who were killed in World War I.
When World War II started he was in the USA. He stayed there and taught at Berkeley, California until 1941. Then he returned to England. For a time he was Director of Music of the BBC. He wrote an opera "The Olympians". In 1953 he was made Master of the Queen's Music. He kept that position until his death, writing many pieces of music for official royal occasions. 
He was given many honours, including the Companion of Honour and the Royal Victorian Order. 
In his later years he composed several works for orchestra as well as for choirs.
He died on 27 March 1975. His wife, Gertrude died on 21 November 2008 at the age of 104.

Plumbing

Plumbing (which comes from the Latin word "plumbum", which means lead, as pipes were once made from lead) is the job of working with pipes, tubing and plumbing fixtures for drinking water systems and getting rid of waste. A plumber is someone who fixes or puts in piping systems, plumbing fixtures and equipment such as water heaters. Many plumbers are construction workers. The plumbing industry is an important part of every developed economy because people need clean water and safe ways to move and store waste.
Plumbing also refers to a system of pipes and fixtures put in a building to move water and the get rid of waste that is in water. Plumbing is different from water and sewage systems because plumbing system serves one building, while water and sewage systems serve a group of buildings or a city.
Plumbing was very rare until modern cities grew in the 19th century. At about the same time, public health leaders began wanting better systems to get rid of waste. Before this, people got rid of waste by collecting it and dumping it onto the ground or into rivers. However, there were some plumbing pipes in the city settlements of the Indus Valley Civilization by 2700 B.C. Plumbing was also used during the ancient civilizations such as the Greek, Roman, Persian, Indian, and Chinese civilizations as they built public baths and needed drinking water, and somewhere to drain waste. The Romans used pipe inscriptions to stop people from stealing water. 
These systems did not improve much over the years. There were almost no improvements from the time of the Roman aqueducts and lead pipes until the 19th century. Eventually the development of separate, underground water and sewage systems got rid of open sewage ditches and cesspools. Most large cities today send solid wastes through pipes to sewage treatment plants. Treatment separates water from waste and makes the water more pure before it goes into streams or other bodies of water. Most places stopped using lead for drinking water after World War II because of the dangers of lead poisoning. At this time, copper piping was started because it was safer than using lead pipes.
Water systems in ancient times used gravity to move water. They used pipes or channels usually made of clay, lead, bamboo or stone. Today, water-supply systems use a network of high-pressure pumps, and pipes are now made of copper, brass, plastic, or other nontoxic material. Drain and vent lines are made of plastic, steel, cast-iron, and lead. Lead is not used in pipes today because it can be poisonous.
The 'straight' sections of plumbing systems are of pipe or tube. A pipe is usually made by casting or welding, where a tube is made through extrusion. Pipe usually has thicker walls and may be threaded or welded, where tubes have thinner walls, and needs special joining techniques such as 'brazing', 'compression fitting', 'crimping', or for plastics, 'solvent welding'.
As well as the straight pipe or tubing, many fittings are required in plumbing systems, such as valves, elbows, tees, and unions.
Plumbing fixtures are designed for the people who use the water. Some examples of fixtures include water closets (also known as toilets), urinals, bidets, showers, bathtubs, utility and kitchen sinks, drinking fountains, ice makers, humidifiers, air washers, fountains, and eye wash stations.
Much of the plumbing work in places where many people live is done under government rules. Putting in plumbing and fixing plumbnig generally must be done according to plumbing and building codes to protect the people who live or work in the buildings.

Copepod

Copepods (meaning "oar feet") are small, shrimp-like crustaceans that swim in seas, lakes, and ponds. Copepods are very important in the food web, and many animals eat them.
There are 10 orders of copepods and over 4500 species; a few orders are free-swimming, but many are parasites (of fish). The free-swimming copepods move through the water in jerky motions by moving their swimming legs.

Young, New South Wales

Young is a town in New South Wales, Australia. It is the centre of Young Shire. It is on the Olympic Highway. It is about 2 hours drive from Canberra. Young is in a valley surrounded by hills. In 2001 there were 6,821 people living in Young. 
Young is known as the Cherry Capital Of Australia and every year hosts the National Cherry Festival.
 The indigenous people of the district were members of the Burrowmunditory tribe, part of the Wiradjuri people.
James White was the first European settler in the area. He started Burrangong Station (farm) in 1826 by taking an area of 100 square miles.
Gold was found in the area in 1860. Until that time the area was called Lambing Flat. This was an area where sheep were grazed before the gold rush. The town was officially listed in 1861. About 470,000 ounces of gold were sent by the armed gold escort from the goldfields. Up to 20,000 miners were digging for gold including about 2,000 Chinese miners.
From November 1860 through to June 1861 European miners attacked Chinese gold miners in the area. This is now known as the Lambing Flat riots. As gold became harder to find, European miners got upset that the Chinese miners were still finding gold. Many Chinese miners were attacked, robbed and killed. They were chased off the goldfields. Eventually the riots were stopped and the Chinese miners had their mining areas given back. The New South Wales Parliament passed the Chinese Immigration Bill. This put a limit on the number of Chinese that could come to New South Wales on any ship. They also had to pay a tax to come New South Wales.
In 1889 Young was the first country town in Australia to have electricity for the streets and houses. Young was the first Local Government Area to start a country school bus system in New South Wales
There are seven schools in Young:
Young Shire Council has started these gardens next to Chinaman‚Äôs Dam. This is an old railway dam about 4¬†km south of Young. They are made to create a peaceful feeling like the Japanese garden at Cowra.
Chinaman‚Äôs Dam was built in the 1860s by Dutch brothers, Herman and John Tiedeman. They used the water for the sluicing of their Victoria Hill gold claims. In the 1870s, the brothers sold the area, including the dam, to a Chinese group who worked the site. It is in a small gully called Pitstone on Sawpit Gully. 
In 1882 the NSW government started to build the first part of the Blayney to Demondrille railway line. To provide water for the steam trains, they decided to use the dam and pump water from it to a tank, known as Young Tank, at the 246 mile post. It is not known whether the railways improved the old dam or built a new one.
From 1885 to 1901, trains stopped at Young Tank to refill with water. In 1901, trains were able to get water at Young Railway Station. The supply of water came from Chinaman‚Äôs Dam. The size of the dam was enlarged in 1911 to hold about 2 million gallons.
The dam was a popular spot for swimming. 
When the town water supply was connected to the Burrinjuck Dam, the railways stopped using Chinaman‚Äôs Dam. In 1937 the area turned into a 36 acre park. The Shire Council looks after the gardens. The dam has since been made bigger.

Ammunition

Ammunition, often called ammo, comes from the French word "la munition". At first it meant all items used for war. This was from the Latin word "munire" (to provide). It now is used only for bullets and other projectiles that are thrown at the enemy by guns, and the gunpowder or other propellant that throws the projectiles. The group word for all types of ammunition is munitions. This means any explosive thng that can be used in combat and includes bombs, missiles, warheads, and mines (landmines, naval mines, and claymore mines). These are made in munitions factories. 
Ammunition is mainly used to attack a target. Ammunition can also include flares and incendaries - chemicals that start fires. Since the making of the cartridge, ammunition has come to mean the putting of a projectile - the item that is sent to hit the target, and its propellant - the chemical that creates the force, into a single package. 
Ammmunition is a complex subject. It covers use of fire to a hit target, use of weapons by people, explosives and propellants, cartridges, high explosive projectiles (HE), warheads, special shells to attack armour and aircraft, carrier projectiles, fuses, mortar ammunition, small arms (revolver and pistol) ammunition, grenades, mines, flares, improved conventional munitions, and computer guided munition.

Emirate

An emirate is a political territory that is ruled by an emir, a dynastic Arab Monarch. The word emirate or amirate comes from , "Imaarah" ; plural: ÿ•ŸÖÿßÿ±ÿßÿ™, "Imaraat". The United Arab Emirates is a federal state of seven federal emirates, each administered by a hereditary emir, these seven elect the federation's President and Prime Minister. Most emirates have either disappeared or become part of a larger modern state, some changed their rulers' title, e.g. to Malik (Arabic for King) or Sultan. Therefore true emirate-states have become rare. 
In Arabic the term can be generalized to mean any province of a country that is administered by a member of the ruling class, especially of a member of the royal family, as in Saudi Arabian governorates.

Judicial nullification

Judicial nullification is a right of a judges to nullify (make invalid) a law if they feel it is too harsh in a particular situation where it is being applied. During the Constitutional Convention many, including George Mason, Elbridge Gerry and James Wilson felt the courts could decide if a law was unconstitutional, and if so, refuse to enforce it. Other founding fathers including John Francis Mercer, Gouverneur Morris and John Dickinson argued against allowing judges to have that power. The issue was left unanswered. However, when deciding that a new law needed the approval of the president, all attempts to have the judiciary approve new laws were soundly defeated. 
Judicial Nullification is sometimes used to mean jury nullification. However, in most uses it means nullifying a law, legal code or statute by a member of the judiciary.
In 2011 the Supreme Court made a ruling that, in essence, says lower court judges can ignore the law. There were three petitions before the Court asking if federal courts need to be stopped from ignoring laws, rules and facts. The Supreme Court refused to grant "certiorari" (a writ seeking judicial review of a matter). In other words, the Court refused to consider the three petitions.

Emir

Emir (; female: '; emira; (Persian and Urdu: ') "commander" or "general", also "prince"; also transliterated as amir, aamir or ameer) is a high title of nobility or office. It is used throughout the Arab world and historically in some Turkic states and Afghanistan. Emirs are usually considered high-ranking sheiks, but in monarchical states the term is also used for princes; then "emirate" means more or less the same as principality in this context.
Emir is used also as a name in Turkey like Emir Niego and Emir Sevinc. 
"Emir" is the most common spelling in English and many other languages (for example, United Arab Emirates). The spelling "amir", that is closer to the original Arabic, is more common for its compounds (e.g., admiral) and in individual names.

Governess

A governess is a female person who works for a family, teaching the children in their home. She is not like a nanny who looks after them all day, dressing them etc. The governess's job is to be their teacher. She saw to their discipline and early education. Often girls received all their education from their governess (or sometimes a tutor), though boys usually went away to boarding school before their teen years, and then some went on to college.
Very few children nowadays have a governess, but it was quite common in the families of rich people until around the beginning of the 20th century. In England quite a lot of young children who lived in the country, a long way from good schools, had a governess. When the boys were old enough they were sent away to a boarding school.
Governesses taught basic skills such as Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. They may also have taught other skills such as French, piano playing and drawing or painting. Sometimes other teachers might be 
A governess was not a household worker, but she was not treated like a member of the family either. This meant that they were often quite lonely, and they usually ate their meals alone. For girls from a middle class background who were not married it was one of the only ways of earning a living. When the children she taught (her "charges") grew up, she would have to find a new job.
Novels of the time were usually about rich families, and a governess often comes into the story, e.g. in Charlotte Bront√´'s "Jane Eyre" or Anne Bront√´'s "Agnes Grey". Maria, the main character in "The Sound of Music", leaves the convent and becomes a governess to the children of the von Trapp family.

Constant Lambert

Constant Lambert (born London, 23 August 1905; died London, 21 August 1951) was a British composer and conductor.
Lambert‚Äôs father was the painter George Washington Lambert who had come to England from Australia. Lambert was often ill when he was a child. He went to school at Christ's Hospital and won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. He soon became interested in French and Russian music. He became friends with other famous people including the Sitwell family, William Walton, Philip Heseltine and Bernard van Dieren. He and Edith Sitwell were the reciters at a performance of Walton‚Äôs "Fa√ßade".
Lambert was a prodigy: he was composing music for orchestra when he was only 13, and when he was 20 he was asked to write a ballet for Serge Diaghilev's world-famous Ballets Russes ("Romeo and Juliet"). 
He soon became very famous. His best known work is "The Rio Grande" for piano solo, chorus and orchestra. It has a mixture of musical styles: jazz, habaneras and the influence of Delius and Duke Ellington.
During the 1930s he performed a lot as a conductor with the Vic-Wells Ballet (later the Royal Ballet), but he stopped composing music. Lambert thought he had failed as a composer, and only finished two more big works in the last sixteen years of his life. He continued conducting, and appeared at Covent Garden and in BBC broadcasts, and travelled to Europe and America conducting ballets. He was an excellent ballet conductor and helped the dancers to give their best performance.
During the war he became ill. He refused to see a doctor. He was working very hard and also drinking a lot.
Lambert liked jazz and thought it was an important influence on popular culture of the time. He wrote a book about this, called "Music Ho!" (1934). The book is widely read today, although it shows a very personal approach to music.
Lambert was married twice. His first marriage was to Florence Kaye. He later married Isabel Nichols, an artist, in 1947. After Constant Lambert's death, Isabel married the composer Alan Rawsthorne. 
Lambert died on 21 August 1951. He had pneumonia and it was also found that he had diabetes made worse by alcoholism.

Samuel Coleridge-Taylor

Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (born London, 15 August 1875; died Croydon, 1 September 1912) was an English composer.
Coleridge-Taylor was born in Holborn, London. His black father was a doctor from Sierra Leone, his mother was English. His parents were not married. The father went back to Africa by February 1875. He had the job of coroner for the British Empire in the Gambia in the late 1890s. He did not know anything about his son‚Äôs existence.
Coleridge-Taylor was brought up in Croydon . He studied the violin at the Royal College of Music and composition with Charles Villiers Stanford. In 1899 he married Jessie Walmisley who had been a student with him at the RCM. Her parents did not want her to be married to someone of mixed race. The couple had a son, Hiawatha (1900-1980) and a daughter, Avril, born Gwendolyn (1903-1998).
Soon Coleridge-Taylor became known as a composer. Edward Elgar helped him get one of his pieces performed at the Three Choirs Festival. Two months later Stanford conducted the cantata "Hiawatha‚Äôs Wedding Feast", the piece for which he is best remembered. He toured the United States in 1904. This made him even more interested in finding out about his racial heritage. He wanted to do for African music what Johannes Brahms had done for Hungarian music and Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k for Bohemian music. He had met the American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar in London and set some of his poems to music. Several people encouraged him to learn more about his heritage.
Coleridge-Taylor was a shy man, but he was a very good conductor. He was often asked to adjudicate at music festivals.
Coleridge-Taylor was 37 when he died of pneumonia. His widow hardly had any money, but King George V gave her a pension of GB¬£100, which shows how popular Coleridge-Taylor had been as a composer. A memorial concert was held later in 1912 at the Royal Albert Hall and gathered ¬£300.
Coleridge-Taylor's works were often performed by Sir Malcolm Sargent who conducted ten seasons of a costumed ballet version of "Hiawatha" at the Royal Albert Hall between 1928 and 1939 with the Royal Choral Society (600 to 800 singers) and 200 dancers.
Coleridge-Taylor's best-known work is his cantata "Hiawatha's Wedding-feast", which was performed very often by choral groups in England during his lifetime and for many years after his death. He wrote several other pieces about Hiawatha: "The Death of Minnehaha", "Overture to The Song of Hiawatha" and "Hiawatha's Departure". 
He also wrote a lot of chamber music, anthems and other works. The orchestral piece "Petite Suite de Concert" used to be very popular, but its Romanticism sounds a little old-fashioned now.

The oldest symbol is the Lahore Resolution, adopted by the All India Muslim League on 23 March 1940, and which presented the formal demand for greater autonomy for Muslims in united India, and later led to the demand for a separate and independent 'Pakistan'. The Minar-e-Pakistan memorial tower which was built in 1968 on the site where the Lahore Resolution was passed. The national flag was adopted just before independence was achieved on 14 August 1947. The national anthem and the state emblem were each adopted in 1954. There are also several other symbols including the national animal, bird, flower and tree.

Sei whale

The Sei whale ("Balaenoptera borealis") is a dark-gray, stream-lined baleen whale that is found worldwide except in polar waters. It swims in small pods of 3-5 whales but larger groups may form at rich feeding grounds. It has very fine grey-black baleen that traps very small particles of food. It is a rorqual whale (a large baleen whale) that is similar to theBryde's whales.
The Sei whale is also called the Sardine whale, the Pollack whale, the Coalfish whale, the Japan Finner, and Rudolphi's rorqual. Large numbers of these whales were hunted until recently for their oil and meat. It is the fastest of the great whales and can swim at about 23¬†mph (20 knots) in short bursts.
Sei whales are carnivores that filter-feed plankton (tiny crustaceans like krill, copepods, etc.) and small fish from the water.

His wife Rukmini or Rakhumai stands with him.
Vithoba's main temple is at Pandharpur in Maharashtra. It is close to its border with Karnataka. Two Hindu sects, the Varkari sect of Maharashtra and Haridasa sect of Karnataka worship Vithoba as their main god. The Varkari poet-saints have written devotional poems called "abhanga"s in praise of god Vithoba. The abhangas are written in the language Marathi. The Haridasa poets have also written poems, devoted to Vithoba in the Kannada language. The two most important festivals associated with Vithoba are "Shayani Ekadashi" in the Hindu month of Ashadha, and "Prabodini Ekadashi" in the Hindu month of Kartik.

Breadalbane is a very historic town. There are now only a few houses. In the past there was a hotel, service station and a railway station. These are now closed, although the old hotel and service station buildings are still there. They are now used as private houses. The railway station opened in 1875 and closed in 1974. The signal box was still used until 1979. All trace of the station has been removed, although a loading bank is still standing.

Hydrofoil

A hydrofoil is a type of boat that can lift its hull out of the water with a pair of special wings underwater. These wings are like the wings of an airplane.
When a hydrofoil moves quickly, its wings allow it to fly. When this happens the boat is said to be in "foilborne". The result of flying means less of the boat is touching the water and can make the boat have less drag which allows it to move faster (drag slows a boat down).
or special pontoons when going fast keep it out of the water.

Gundaroo is a small village in New South Wales, Australia. It is in the Yass Valley Shire. It is built near the Yass River. Gundaroo is about 16 kms north of Sutton and about 15 km west of the Lake George range. About 300 people live there. 
The explorers Charles Throsby and Joseph Wild travelled through the Yass River valley in 1820. The Aborigines called the valley "Candariro" which means "blue crane". This name might be the meaning of the word Gundaroo. Governor Lachlan Macquarie gave the first Europen settler, Peter Cooney, 30 acres in 1825. Other farms were started quickly with about 400 people in the 1840s. The Harrow Inn (hotel) was built in 1834. A post office was built in 1848 and an Anglican church, St Lukes in Upper Gundaroo (now part of a pottery business), in 1849. The first school opened in 1850 and a Police station in 1852. When gold was discovered in the area in 1852 many more people came to the town.
Gundaroo has become a place where people who work in Canberra can live. It is a village for tourists from Canberra to visit because of its well cared for historic buildings.

Christmas 1994 nor'easter

The Christmas 1994 nor'easter was a strong cyclone along the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada. It developed from an area of low pressure in the southeast Gulf of Mexico near the Florida Keys, and moved across the state of Florida.
A weather system moved towards the southeast from the central Great Plains into the Deep South of the United States. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, the weather system became a cyclone. An approaching trough pushed the system across Florida. A forecaster at the National Hurricane Center, Jack Beven, said that "as it [the storm] moved out into the Bahamas, it appeared to take on the characteristics of a tropical storm." He also noted that because of the uncertainty, the National Hurricane Center did not call the weather system a tropical cyclone.
The cyclone was said to be a "hybrid" storm. The cyclone quickly gained strength in warm waters from the Gulf Stream, and because of cold air over the United States. The system continued to become stronger while moving within the Gulf Stream. The storm developed central atmospheric convection, which is unusual for a storm of its type. Extratropical cyclone. Also, the system developed an eye, which is usually seen in tropical cyclones. Even though the cyclone showed signs of a tropical storm, forecaster Jack Beven stated: "There was no front associated with it [the storm] and it had a warm core, but the radius of maximum winds was more than 150¬†nautical miles [175¬†mi, 280¬†km], so under the standard NHC criteria it didn‚Äôt qualify as a tropical storm." On December 23 and 24, the nor'easter intensified to attain a barometric pressure of 970|mb. Another low pressure system that developed behind the storm became stronger, and grew to be larger in size than the original storm. Due to the Fujiwhara effect, the large circulation of the secondary low moved the original nor'easter towards the northwest. The nor'easter passed along the south shore of Long Island, and it made landfall near New York City on December 24. Later, it moved over southeastern New York State. On December 25, which is Christmas Day, the system began to lose strength as it moved towards Nova Scotia, before the pair of low pressure systems moved out to sea early on December 26.

River Wear

The Wear is a river in northeast England. It starts in Wearhead, County Durham and opens up into the North Sea at Sunderland.
Much of the River Wear shows the history of the Industrial Revolution. Its upper end runs through lead mining country, until this gives way to coal seams of the Durham coalfield for the rest of its length. As a result of limestone quarrying, lead mining and coal mining, the Wear valley was amongst the first places to see the development of railways. The Weardale Railway continues to run occasional services between Stanhope and Wolsingham.
The upland area of Upper Weardale has a flora which survives from the end of the last Ice Age. After the Ice Age, the Wear valley became thickly forested. During the Neolithic period and increasingly in the Bronze Age, the forests were progressively cleared for agriculture.

Boughton studied with Charles Villiers Stanford and Walford Davies. He wrote many different kinds of music including symphonies, concertos, part-songs, songs, chamber music and opera. His best known work was the opera "The Immortal Hour". His carol "Bethlehem" (1915) became very popular in England and in many other countries.
He was a great admirer of the composer Richard Wagner who had built his own theatre, the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, in the German town of Bayreuth. Boughton wanted to create an "English Bayreuth" at Glastonbury, so he started the series of Glastonbury Festivals that took place from 1914 until 1926. From 1927 until his death in 1960, he lived at Kilcot near Newent, Gloucestershire.

Bayreuth Festspielhaus

The Bayreuth Festspielhaus ("Bayreuth Festival Theatre") is an opera house in the town of Bayreuth, Germany. The German opera composer Richard Wagner got the opera house built so that his own music could be performed properly. He had lots of ideas about how opera should be performed, and he thought that there was no opera house in Germany that was good enough for performances of his operas. Today it is still the place where every year there is a festival, the Bayreuth Festival, which is dedicated only to the operas of Richard Wagner.
King Ludwig II of Bavaria was a great admirer of Richard Wagner and he gave a lot of money for the opera house to be built. Wagner watched the construction all the time and made sure that everything was built in the way he wanted. Work on the building started on 22 May 1872 (Wagner's birthday), and it was ready four years later when, for the first time, all four operas which make up the cycle called "Der Ring des Nibelungen" ("The Ring of the Nibelung"), were performed.
The opera house is big enough for an audience of 1,925. One unusual thing is the orchestra pit, which is right under the stage, covered by a hood, so that the orchestra cannot be seen at all by the audience. Wagner wanted the audience to be able to concentrate properly on the action on the stage instead of being distracted by watching the orchestra. It makes it very difficult for the orchestra and the singers to be together, and conductors have to get used to the problem.
The Festspielhaus also has a double proscenium, which makes it look as if the stage is farther away than it actually is.

Carl Reinecke

Carl Reinecke (born Altona, Hamburg 23 June 1824; died Leipzig, 10 March 1910) was a Danish-born composer, conductor, and pianist.
Reinecke was born near Hamburg, which was part of Denmark at the time. Carl learned music from his father. He was soon playing the piano in public and was composing by the age of twelve.
When he was 19 he travelled about giving concerts. He went as far east as Riga. In 1846 he became Court Pianist for King Christian VIII in Copenhagen. He stayed there until 1848, composing four piano concertos as well as concertos for violin, cello, harp and flute. He continued to travel, including to Leipzig where he met Schumann, Mendelssohn and Liszt. 
In 1851 he became a professor at the Cologne Conservatory. Later he had conducting jobs in Barmen and Breslau.
In 1860, Reinecke was made director of the famous Gewandhaus Orchestra concerts in Leipzig, and professor of composition and piano at the Conservatorium. He became director of the Conservatorium and made it one of the best in Europe. He conducted the Gewandhaus Orchestra for 35 years and raised the standard of their playing. He conducted many first performances, including the first complete performance of Brahms's "German Requiem" (1869).
Perhaps his best-known piece is the flute sonata "Undine". He taught many famous musicians, including Edvard Grieg, Christian Sinding, Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek, Isaac Alb√©niz, Johan Svendsen, Felix Weingartner and Max Bruch. 
At the age of 80, Reinecke recorded his playing on piano roll, making him the earliest-born pianist to have his playing recorded in any way.

Carcoar, New South Wales

Carcoar is a town in New South Wales, Australia. It is in the Blayney Shire. In 2006, 218 people lived in Carcoar. It next to the Mid-Western Highway, west of Sydney and south west of Bathurst. It is above sea-level. Carcoar is in a small green valley, with the town on both sides of the Belubula River.
Carcoar was once one of the most important government centres in Western New South Wales. The town has been classified by the National Trust. This is because it has a lot of buildings from the 1800s. Carcoar is a Aboriginal word from the Gundungura people meaning either "frog" or "kookaburra".
Nearby towns are Blayney, Millthorpe, Mandurama, Neville, Lyndhurst and Barry.
The first people to live in the area were the Gundungura people. The first Europen to travel through the area was surveyor George Evans. He came from Bathurst in 1815 and set up his camp on Coombing Creek.
The first settlers arrived in 1821. The first official land grant, 560 acres (2.3¬†km¬≤), was given to Thomas Icely on 26 May 1829. He named his farm "Coombing Park". In 1838 Thomas Icely asked that a village be started to supply items for his big farm. On 29 September 1839 Carcoar became the third town west of the Blue Mountains.
The first land for houses in the town were sold in 1840. By 1850 Carcoar was the second biggest town west of the mountains. It was second in size to Bathurst. It became a banking and government centre for the area. In 1857 the town's public school opened. It is one of the oldest schools in Australia.
When gold was found in the west in the 1860s, Carcoar became less important. The government began building a number of important buildings in the late 1870s. At this time, "Coombing Park" was supplying iron ore to the Lithgow steelworks.
Because the town is at the bottom of a steep valley it wasn't suitable for the railway. The railway line went to Blayney north west in 1874. By the early 1880s many people had left the town. Carcoar was joined to the railway line in 1888 when the Blayney-Demondrille Line.
In the 1980s train services were stopped between Cowra and Blayney. This included included Carcoar. This section was re-opened by the Lachlan Valley Railway. The LVR run tourist trains, mainly from Cowra to Blayney and Canowindra. They have now moved into general freight haulage.
Carcoar's was often visited by escaped convicts and bushrangers. They came into the town and robbed many times.
In one robbery, German Charley tried to stop Mickey Bourke from stealing a racehorse from the "Coombing Park" stables. He was shot dead by Bourke. Another bushranger, Curran was captured by the local police. The government sent extra police and a magistrate to the town. Frank Gardiner was working in the area after six years gaol for stealing horses. He gave up farm work and started stealing cattle.
In 1863 Johnny Gilbert and John O'Meally tried to rob the Commercial Bank. This may be Australia's first daylight bank robbery. Both bushrangers ran away when a bank worker fired a shot into the ceiling of the bank.
The Presbyterian Reverend James Adam was held up by Ben Hall. Hall liked the Adam and didn't rob him.
The town has been used as a location for many movie and television productions. They include:

Bach Choir

The Bach Choir is a world-famous amateur choir based in London. They sing the music of many composers, not just Johann Sebastian Bach.
The Bach Choir gave its first concert on 26 April 1876 with a performance of Bach‚Äôs "Mass in B minor". At this time more and more people in England were becoming interested in the music of Bach, but the "Mass in B minor" had never been performed in England. The conductor Otto Goldschmidt conducted the concert, and afterwards the Choir's committee decided to make The Bach Choir a permanent choir. Otto Goldschmidt was appointed as the Musical Director.
In those days all choir members came from rich families (the upper classes). New members had to pass an audition, but they also had to be ‚Äúproposed‚Äù (recommended) by existing members and accepted by the committee. Queen Victoria became Patron of the choir in 1879. The Choir sang music by lots of different composers as well as Bach‚Äôs motets, church music and the "Mass in B minor". 
Goldschmidt resigned in 1885 and Charles Villiers Stanford became conductor. Stanford had already become well known as organist of Trinity College, Cambridge and conductor of the Cambridge University Musical Society. He widened the repertoire of the Choir, and the concerts also included works for orchestra. Hubert Parry composed his popular anthem "Blest Pair of Sirens" for the choir to sing at the Golden Jubilee of the Queen in 1887. The Jubilee concert also included the first London performance of Berlioz's "Te Deum", a work dedicated to the late Prince Consort. 
Towards the end of the nineteenth century changes were made, including regular auditions for existing choir members, and stopping the requirement for new members to be proposed. Henry Walford Davies became the conductor. He improved the choir which was then taken over by Hugh Allen in 1908. 
Hugh Allen found himself conducting a choir which included the young Ralph Vaughan Williams, who had joined in 1903 and Adrian Boult, who joined around 1914. Allen was strict, but good, and during his time as conductor the Choir gave many important first London performances including Vaughan Williams' "Toward the Unknown Region" and "A Sea Symphony" and Parry's "Songs of Farewell". 
When Allen resigned in 1921 his place was taken by Ralph Vaughan Williams who had by then become a famous composer. He had a gentler approach than Allen. He stayed until 1928 when he left to be able to work more on composition. In his place the Choir appointed Gustav Holst, but he became ill and was never able to take up his post. Instead, Adrian Boult took over for three years. During his time it became tradition to perform Bach‚Äôs "St Matthew Passion" every year. This tradition continues today.
Boult was replaced by Reginald Jacques (pronounced: ‚ÄúJakes‚Äù), who had been a pupil of Hugh Allen at Oxford. Jacques stayed until 1960. He managed to keep the Choir going through World War II, and the annual Carol Concerts became part of their tradition. They made a recording of the "St Matthew Passion" which filled 42 sides of the old 78 rpm. gramophone records.
Jacques was followed by David Willcocks who led the Choir almost to the end of the century. He broadened the Choir‚Äôs repertoire, and they gave the first London concert hall performance of Britten's War Requiem, conducted by Britten himself, with Galina Vishnevskaya, Peter Pears and Tom Krause (who replaced Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau at the last minute) as soloists. The Choir then recorded the work and this recording sold more than 200,000 copies in the first five months. Willcocks took the Choir on tours to many parts of the world. His last performance was in 1998.
Today the Choir is conducted by David Hill. As well as spending much of his time with The Bach Choir, he is also conductor of the BBC Singers. The choir continues to do new things, such as giving world premieres of new music, as well as keeping up the tradition of performing the "St Matthew Passion" every spring at the Royal Festival Hall.

Cruella de Vil

Cruella De Vil (obviously a play on "cruel" and "devil") is the villain in the Dodie Smith book The Hundred and One Dalmatians who kidnaps (dognaps) the puppies for their fur. She is described as having one half of her hair white and the other half black, an extreme fondness for pepper and a preference for elevated temperatures.
In the 1961 Disney animated movie her voice was played by Betty Lou Gerson. The movie featured a song about her sung by Roger whose lyrics begin:
Later, in the 1996 live-action remake, and its 2000 sequel, "102 Dalmatians", she was played by Glenn Close. Shortly afterward, Cruella was a regular viallian in ', where she was voiced by April Winchell. This time, though, she wanted to steal the Dearly Farm, seeing how killing animals for fashion was deemed politically incorrect. However, she returned to hunting dogs in "House of Mouse" (which features an ongoing joke in which she inspects dogs from other Disney movies with a measuring ruler) and ', both of which had Susanne Blakeslee as her voice.

101 Dalmatians (1996 movie)

101 Dalmatians is a movie made by The Walt Disney Company in 1996. It is a remake of the 1961 animated film "One Hundred and One Dalmatians" (which was based on Dodie Smith's 1956 novel "The Hundred and One Dalmatians"). The movie's main actor is Glenn Close as Cruella de Vil. Unlike in the earlier versions of the story, the dalmatians are played by real dalmatian actors, and none of the dalmatians talk. A sequel, "102 Dalmatians", was made in 2000 and was released in November. This movie is called simply "101" in Japan, like its sequel, which is called "102".
"101 Dalmatians" was released on VHS on April 15, 1997 and as a DVD on December 12, 2000. Because many people bought the DVD, Disney re-released the film on September 16, 2008 in the United States.
The movie made lots of money when it was in movie theatres, earning $136,189,294 in the United States and $184,500,000 in other places, bringing its worldwide total to $320,689,294.

African wildcat

The African wildcats ("Felis silvestris lybica") are small, fierce cats that live in forests, grasslands, and brush lands in Africa and the Middle East. They are the closest living relatives of the domestic cat.
It is a wildcat subspecies which occurs across northern Africa and extends around the edges of the Arabian Peninsula to the Caspian Sea. It is the most common and widely distributed wild cat, and is listed as "Least Concern" by IUCN since 2002.
The African wildcat appears to have diverged from the other subspecies about 131,000 years ago. Some individual African wildcats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Middle East, and are the ancestors of the domestic cat. Remains of domesticated cats were found in human burials in Cyprus, done by Neolithic farmers about 9,500 years ago. Hybrids between domestic cats and African wildcats are still common today.
African wildcats are generally crepuscular, hunting at dawn and dusk. They are diurnal (most active during the day) during very cold weather. They are very good climbers. African Wildcats live for 12 to 15 years. They are about 50 percent larger than domesticated (tame) cats. 
African wildcats are carnivores, like all cats. These fast, solitary hunters eat small to medium-sized mammals, birds, reptiles, frogs, invertebrates, and eggs.

Gale

A gale is a very strong wind. The Beaufort scale is a way to measure weather conditions, based on observations. The first level of the scale that uses the word gale is 7 beaufort (of a total of 13 steps). There are other definitions as well. The U.S. Government's National Weather Service defines a gale as 34 to 47 knots (63¬†km/h to 87¬†km/h or 39 miles per hour to 54 miles per hour) of sustained surface winds. Forecasters typically issue gale warnings when winds of this strength are expected.
Other sources use minima as low as and maxima as high as . The definition is very non-standard. A common alternative definition of the maximum is .

<doc id="146544" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146544" title="Marin Marais">
Marin Marais

Marin Marais (31 May 1656, Paris ‚Äì 15 August 1728, Paris) was a French composer and viol player. He is regarded as one of the great French musicians of the Baroque.
Marais, the son of a poor shoe maker, was educated in a choir school were he was taught to play the viol. He then learnt from Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe, a famous bass viol player. In six months he was said to be better than his teacher. In 1675, aged 19, he joined the orchestra of the Paris Opera. This was where he met Jean-Baptiste Lully, who was the director of the Opera. Lully taught him to compose music. Marais often conducted the operas Lully had written.
Marais was hired as a musician in 1676 to play at the royal court of Versailles. He did quite well as court musician. In 1679 he was appointed "ordinaire de la chambre du roy pour la viole", a title he kept until 1725.
He was a master of the basse de viol. He wrote a lot of music for that instrument, he was the most important French composer for it. He wrote five books of "Pi√®ces de viole" (1686-1725). Most of the pieces in the book are suites with basso continuo. These were quite popular in the court, and for these he was remembered in later years as he who "founded and firmly established the empire of the viol" (Hubert Le Blanc, 1740). His other works include a book of "Pi√®ces en trio" (1692) and four operas (1693-1709). "Alcyone" (1706) is well known for its storm scene. Marais became the conductor of the Paris Opera in 1706, but after the failure of his 1709 opera, "S√©m√©l√©" he gradually withdrew from public life. He married Catherine d'Amicourt, on 21 September 1676. They had 19 children together. Two of the children, Vincent Marais and Roland Marais also became famous musicians, as well as his grandson, Nicolas Marais.
Titon du Tillet wrote about Marais in his book "Le Parnasse fran√ßois". He describes a piece from Marais' fourth book called "The Labyrinth", which goes through lots of keys. The notes which are often dissonant, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, describe a man caught in a labyrinth. Eventually the man comes out of it happily and the music finishes with a gracious and natural chaconne. Another piece called "La Gamme" [The Scale], very gradually goes up the steps of the octave and then down again.
Facsimiles of all five books of Marais' "Pi√®ces de viole" are published by √âditions J.M. Fuzeau. A complete critical edition of his instrumental works in seven volumes, edited by John Hsu, is published by Broude Brothers.
Marais and his music were featured in the movie "Tous les matins du monde" (1991). The movie shows a detailed, imagined life of Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe. Marais' music is heard a lot, including his longer work "Sonnerie de Ste-Genevi√®ve du Mont-de-Paris" (1723). A recording of the Sonnerie performed on a Fairlight synthesizer was used in the cult classic film "Liquid Sky".

<doc id="146553" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146553" title="Burgess Hill">
Burgess Hill

Burgess Hill is a town in West Sussex, England, UK. It is not far from the border with East Sussex. It is 38¬†miles¬†(62¬†km) south of London, 10¬†miles¬†(16¬†km) north of Brighton and Hove, and 29¬†miles¬†(47¬†km) east-northeast of the county town of Chichester. It had a population of 28,803 at the time of the 2001 Census. Other nearby towns include Haywards Heath to the north and Lewes, the county town of East Sussex, to the east.
Burgess Hill is mainly situated just on the West Sussex side of the border dividing the two counties. Parts of the town are across the county boundary in East Sussex.
Although a Roman road was built joining London to the South coast and passing through what is now Burgess Hill, there is no evidence that the Romans settled in the area.
From the fourteenth century or earlier the annual Midsummer Fair was held on this common land on 24th June and the last such sheep and lamb fair was held in 1913.
With the development of the London to Brighton mainline railway, however, those in the business soon realised that taking sheep by train was much cheaper and easier than using the old roadways. Most of the animal trading business began to revolve around rail side markets such as those at Hassocks, Haywards Heath and Lewes train stations. By the start of the 20th century, the animal trading business had all but left the Burgess Hill area.
By the early seventeenth century there was a lot of small brick and tile making companies and during this time pieces of common land were given for house building and small businesses. By the early eighteenth century brick making had been extended and four shops and one or two drinking houses were established on the common. Brickmaking by hand still happened until very recently, by Keymer Tiles (formerly the Keymer Brick and Tile company) whose tiles can be found in buildings such as St. James Church, Piccadilly and Manchester Central Station (now G-Mex).
The growth of Brighton in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries brought in professional people looking for places to live. Between 1850 and 1880 the area changed from a small rural settlement to a town of 4,500 residents.
In 1897 the Victoria Pleasure Gardens were opened by local household name Edwin Street, a well-known farmer and butcher. The gardens were opened in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, and contained a large lake, and what can only be described as a small early version of a roller coaster, known as a switchback . The lake was used for boating in the summer, and skating in the winter. The frozen lake was always tested by Mr Street, a man of 23 stone, before being used in the winter. This area is now the Victoria Business Park.
The town gradually grew bigger, having its largest population increase between the years of 1951 and 1961, when the population of about 7,000 residents almost doubled. This earned Burgess Hill the title of fastest growing town in the south-east. By 1956, the Victoria Industrial Estate was completed, and has since expanded. It now contains the local headquarters of two large international companies. In 1986 a smaller industrial estate to in the north of the town developed, known as Sheddingdean Industrial Estate. Both Sheddingdean and Victoria have now been renamed as business parks.
Housing estates played their part in building up the population of Burgess Hill throughout the second half of the 20th century; in the west of the town they provided a wide mix of new residents; many of them young families and the Folders Lane estate more families settled, along with some richer residents.
The next substantial development was Priory Village in the south west of Burgess Hill, sometimes known as the Tesco estate, due to its proximity to the supermarket. Again, this brought in a mix of incomes, again, many of them young families.
It must be noted that as well as the aforementioned developments, there have been two council estates built in the town - one close to Cants Lane, in the town's north east, and the area around Denham Road in the west, both of course adding to the ever rising population of the town.
Although now part of the town, World's End, to the north of the town, was originally a separate community. It still retains its own shops and community association, and is served by Wivelsfield railway station.
Burgess Hill has a Conservative member of parliament.
There are ten schools for children aged up to 11 years and four schools for children aged 11‚Äì16/18.
There are a total of 9 churches and a Christian centre in Burgess Hill.
Burgess Hill is also home to the Mid Sussex Christian Centre.
In the town centre there is a large park (St. John's), and many other smaller recreation grounds around the town. There is a substantial leisure centre on the northern edge of Burgess Hill named the Triangle.
Burgess Hill Town Football Club plays football (soccer)and plays its home games at Leylands Park. Burgess Hill Rugby Football Club, or The Sussex All Blacks, are the local Rugby Football club.
There is also a Squash Club that plays at the Triangle Leisure Centre every Saturday and Monday, and has a team that plays in the East Sussex County League.
There is also a Running Club that meet at the Burgess Hill School for Girls every Wednesday evening. Members compete in local and national charity and fun races.
The Skate Park in the centre of town provides sporting opportunities, and holds an annual competition.
The Triangle (or Olympos Burgess Hill as it has been rechristened) is one of the venues in the South East supporting the London 2012 Olympic Games, and will serve as a base and training centre for teams from around the globe.
Burgess Hill's twin towns are:
A square in Schmallenberg has been named Burgess Hill Platz.

John Ireland

John Ireland (born near Manchester, 13 August 1879; died Washington, Sussex, 12 June 1962) was an English composer. He is particularly remembered for his "Piano Concerto" and for his church music, especially the anthem "Greater love hath no man", the song "The Holy Boy" and the hymn tune to "My song is love unknown". He had an unhappy childhood, and he always felt unsure of himself and rather lonely.
John Ireland was born in Bowdon, Greater Manchester. His father, who was 70 years old, was a publisher who owned a newspaper. He had married for a second time after his wife had died, and John was the youngest of five children from the second marriage. His mother was 30 years younger than her husband. When John was 14 his mother died, and his father died the next year.
John Ireland studied piano and organ at the Royal College of Music. Later he also had composition lessons from Charles Villiers Stanford. He later became a teacher at the College himself. His pupils included the composers Alan Bush and
Geoffrey Bush (who were not related), Ernest Moeran and Benjamin Britten. Geoffrey Bush later helped to prepare a lot of Ireland‚Äôs works for publication. Ireland mostly made his living as an organist and choirmaster.
Ireland enjoyed going to the Channel Islands. He liked the landscapes there. He was evacuated from them just before the German invasion during World War II. 
John Ireland married once, but his marriage only lasted a few months.
On 10 September 1949, his 70th birthday was celebrated in a special Prom concert. The soloist in the "Piano Concerto" was the pianist Eileen Joyce, who later made the first gramophone recording of the concerto. 
Ireland retired in 1953. He moved to a tiny village in Sussex, where he lived in an old windmill which had been changed into a home.
He died aged 82 in Washington, Sussex of heart failure.
John Ireland was never much influenced by folksong like many other English composers of his time. His music is more related to Impressionism. He liked the music of French composers such as Debussy and Ravel as well as Igor Stravinsky and Bart√≥k. His "Piano Concerto" is one of his best works. It shows that he developed his own personal style of harmony. Most of his other good works are short pieces, including many for piano solo. His best-known piece is the song "The Holy Boy". It is heard in many different arrangements. His songs to poems by A. E. Housman, Thomas Hardy, Christina Rossetti, John Masefield, Rupert Brooke and others, are among some of the best English art songs.. He also wrote hymns, carols, and other sacred choral music; among choirs he is probably best known for the anthem "Greater love hath no man", often sung in services that remember the victims of war. Another choral work, "These things shall be" expresses his deepest hopes for mankind, although in his last years he said that he hated the work.

Frank Bridge

Frank Bridge (born Brighton, 26 February 1879; died Eastbourne, 10 January 1941) was an English composer, violist and conductor. His music often sounded quite modern to the people of his day. He wrote many excellent works including chamber music as well as orchestral music. One of his composition pupils was Benjamin Britten. Later Britten remembered his teacher by using one of Bridge‚Äôs tunes and making them into a piece of music called "Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge".
Bridge was born in Brighton and studied at the Royal College of Music in London from 1899 to 1903. One of his teachers was Charles Villiers Stanford. He played the viola in several string quartets and conducted many orchestras. He learned difficult music very quickly, and sometimes Henry Wood asked him to take his place when he was not well enough to conduct himself. After a while he spent most of his time composing. He privately taught several pupils, including Benjamin Britten, who later helped to make his teacher's music better known and honoured him in his "Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge" for string orchestra (1937), based on a theme from the second of Bridge's "Three Idylls for String Quartet" (1906). 
Bridge died in Eastbourne.
Bridge‚Äôs early works show the influence of Johannes Brahms and Charles Villiers Stanford. He wrote some excellent chamber music and songs. The "Phantasie Quartet" and the "String Quartet no 1" show his talent. His later pieces such as the third (1926) and fourth (1937) string quartets have quite complicated harmonies and show his interest in the music of Schoenberg as well as the harmonies of Maurice Ravel and Alexander Scriabin. His most important orchestral works include "The Sea" and "Summer". He wrote some lovely chamber music for the cello as well as many songs. In his later years his harmonies become quite advanced, for example a favourite chord of his can be found by playing a C minor chord and a D major chord together. In his longer pieces the speed of the music often changes and he avoids repeating himself exactly. 
For a long time after his death his music was hardly ever played, but more recently musicians have discovered the greatness of his compositions. Pianists like to play the popular piano piece called "Rosemary".

The WWE Tribute to the Troops is a televised event held every year since 2005 by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in December around Christmas and Hanukkah. The wrestlers and employees of the WWE travel to Iraq and Afghanistan to honor the United States military. The event features wrestlers from "Raw", "SmackDown", and "Extreme Championship Wrestling" (ECW) brands competing in matches against each other. They hold a televised episode of "Raw" on an open field for any troop member to attend for free. Along the travel, wrestlers and employees stop at autograph sessions and local hospitals to visit those who fight and may have been injured in war. Walter Reed Army Medical Center and Bethesda Naval Hospital are among the hospitals visited by the WWE employees. The WWE most recently held its fifth annual event, and has their next visit planned for December 2008.
In 2004, USO of Metropolitan Washington awarded the WWE the first "Legacy of Hope" award for their extensive support of their troops and the USO‚Äôs Operation Care Package program. In 2006, WWE received the "Secretary of Defense Exceptional Public Service" award. It was presented to WWE Chairman, Vince McMahon and other wrestlers. Upon receiving the award, McMahon handed it to wrestler, John "Bradshaw" Layfield (JBL), noting that the idea of the Tribute to the Troops was his original idea. WWE also received recognition from General Casey, the Commander of Multinational Forces Iraq. The WWE generally stays for three days.
Overall, WWE has traveled to Iraq and Afghanistan six consecutive times since 2003. The events are held in December every year, as they are intended to be a holiday treat for the troops. Not every WWE wrestler and employee attends the trips, but any wrestler willing to go may attend, with their brand not considered a factor.

Kenneth Freeman

Kenneth "Poppi" Freeman (d. May 13, 1985) was a street vendor from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania who sold newspapers along with Billy Cook. He is known for being an important suspect in the Mumia Abu-Jamal case (the murder of Daniel Faulkner). Cynthia White, a key witness, said that Freeman was present, but did not name him. At the time of the crime, Freeman was a front passenger in Billy Cook's Volkswagen. In two different lineups done to determine the killer, Cynthia White picked him. Billy Cook, the brother of Abu-Jamal (Wesley Cook), claimed later that Freeman personally confessed to him as being armed and shooting Faulkner. Arnold Beverly, in an affidavit where he confessed to the murder, named "another guy" as a shooter. Some witnesses testified that they saw a man with a green army jacket going away from the crime scene. Billy Cook said that Kenneth Freeman was wearing a green army jacket.
Freeman was reportedly in Germany in the Army, and usually wore the jacket.
One important contradiction is the fact that Cynthia White picked Freeman out of a lineup as the killer, but later changed her testimony to fit the prosecution's story. This can be explained by her admission that police bribed her to do so, so that she could legally work as a prostitute. That leads to another important inconsistency, which is that Yvette Williams, someone who White knew personally, said that White told her that she did not see the actual killer, which means it was not possible for her to identify Freeman as the killer, unless he confessed to her personally. 
On May 13, 1985, Kenneth Freeman was found dead in an empty area, handcuffed, bound, and naked, his death listed as "natural causes". J. Patrick O'Connor, in his book "The Framing of Mumia Abu-Jamal", says that "[h]is body was found bound, gagged, and naked in a vacant lot".

<doc id="146694" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146694" title="Falsifiability">
Falsifiability

Falsifiability is the capacity to prove something is not correct. 
Scientists make hypotheses and theories about their fields of study. At the start, they hope their hypothesis or theory is true but they and other scientists will use the scientific method to try and prove it false. Falsifiability (or refutability) means that a theory or hypothesis can be proved wrong because it failed a critical test or experiment.
A famous example in the 20th century was the expedition led by Arthur Eddington to Principe Island in Africa in 1919 to record the positions of stars around the Sun during a solar eclipse. The observation of star positions showed that the apparent star positions close to the Sun were changed. In effect, the light passing the Sun was pulled towards the sun by gravitation. This confirmed predictions of gravitational lensing made by Albert Einstein in the general theory of relativity, published in 1915. Eddington's observations were considered to be the first solid evidence in favour of Einstein's theory. Had the observations resulted differently, this would have counted against Einstein's theory, and perhaps refuted it.
Karl Popper had the opinion that only theories that are falsifiable are scientific. Falsifiability is then a line between science and other kinds of knowledge: if it can be refuted, it is science; it if cannot, then it is not science. Many working scientists think Popper was right.
Not everyone agreed with this: Pierre Duhem and Paul Feyerabend had different ideas. Feyerabend's "Against method" (1975) argued that there was no one scientific method. Instead, "whatever works, works" and "anything goes". This is called "epistemological anarchy". 
Duham's idea was more subtle. He thought that for any given set of observations there is a huge and uncountable number of explanations. According to Duhem, an experiment in physics is not just an observation, but an interpretation of observations by means of a theoretical framework. Furthermore, no matter how well one constructs one's experiment, it is impossible to subject an isolated single hypothesis to an experimental test. Instead, it is a whole interlocking group of hypotheses, background assumptions, and theories that is tested. This thesis has come to be known as holism. According to Duhem, it makes crucial experiments impossible.
There are some other problems with falsification:

A tape drive or streamer is a component that is often attached to a computer. It is used to write data to magnetic tape or to read data from it. Usually people use it to do backups. Tape drives are different from hard drives in that the access to the data is sequential (in order). This means to read a certain part of data, all the data before it needs to be read as well. Also tape drives are slow, compared to hard drives. Current capacities range from tens of gigabytes to almost a terabyte, per cartridge.

A Cache algorithm is an algorithm used to manage a cache or group of data. When the cache is full, it decides which item should be deleted from the cache. The word "hit rate" describes how often a request can be served from the cache. The term latency describes for how long a cached item can be obtained. Cache alorithms are a trade-off between hit-rate and latency.
Other things to consider:
Various algorithms also exist to maintain cache coherency. This applies only to situation where "multiple" independent caches are used for the "same" data (for example multiple database servers updating the single shared data file).

<doc id="146726" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146726" title="Thermodynamic entropy">
Thermodynamic entropy

Thermodynamic entropy is a measure of how organized or disorganized energy is present in a system of atoms or molecules. It is measured in joules of energy per unit kelvin. Entropy is an important part of the third law of thermodynamics.
Imagine that a group of molecules has ten units of energy. If the energy in those molecules is perfectly organized, then the molecules can do ten units of work. However, if the energy became less organized (that is, the entropy increased), the molecules might only be able to do six units of work, even though they still have ten units of energy in them.
When total entropy is reached, there is no more energy to spend. A good example of this is a cup of tea. Now suppose your cup of tea is hot. The tea has a lot of energy compared to the room the tea is in. Over time the heat in the tea will spread into the room. The tea will become colder. This is because the energy (heat) in the tea escapes into the surrounding area. Once the tea has gone cold, there is no more heat that can be spread. The tea has thus reached total entropy.
There are two types of "rooms" we recognize when we are talking about entropy: An "open system" and a "closed system". The former means that energy (such as heat) can freely flow into and out of the room. A closed system means that the room is closed off from the outside; no energy can go in or out.
In the case of the tea, the room was a closed system; it had no means for energy to enter. But we can also make it an open system by placing a stove in the room. If we turn on the stove, we can use the heat from the stove to reheat the cup of tea. New usable energy has been brought into the environment. The entropy has thus decreased. The heat that went from the stove into the tea can then again escape into the room again until total entropy has been reached. This is what the second law of thermodynamics describes.
A real life example of an open system is the Earth. The surface gets a lot of energy from the Sun every day. This allows plants to grow and water to stay liquid. If we took away the Sun, plants would die and water would freeze because the surface of our planet would be too cold.

Cornell University

Cornell University ( ) is in Ithaca, New York, United States. It is a private land-grant university, receiving annual funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions. Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White co-founded it in 1865 by sponsoring a bill in the New York State Legislature to designate it as New York's land grant college. The university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge‚Äìfrom the classics to the sciences and from the theoretical to the applied. This goal was uncommon in 1865. The goal is stated in Cornell's motto, an 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: "I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study." Since its founding, Cornell has also been a co-educational, secular institution where admission is offered irrespective of gender, religion or race.
The university has seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus, with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy. The university also administers two satellite medical campuses, one in New York City and one in Education City, Qatar. Cornell is one of two private land grant universities, and its seven undergraduate colleges include three state-supported statutory or contract colleges. As a land grant college, it also operates a cooperative extension outreach program in every county of New York.
Cornell counts more than 255,000 living alumni, 31¬†Marshall Scholars, 28¬†Rhodes Scholars and 41 Nobel laureates as affiliated with the university. It has 13,000 undergraduate and 6,000 graduate students from all 50 states and 122 countries.
Cornell's athletics teams are called the Big Red, and they have 36 varsity teams. They play against other teams in the Ivy League.
Cornell is divided into colleges. Each operates independently and has its own faculty and admission process: The "statutory" or "contract" colleges (which receive direct funding from the New York state government) have "New York State" in their name. Residents of New York who are enrolled in these colleges pay less tuition than other students at the university. Cornell calls its other colleges "endowed colleges".
The four statutory colleges are also units of the State University of New York.
Cornell also had two other colleges that closed. The New York State College of Forrestry closed in 1903. The Nursing School closed in 1979.
Cornell, a research university, produces the fourth largest number of graduates in the world who go on to pursue PhDs in engineering or the natural sciences at American institutions. It is also fifth in the world in producing graduates who pursue PhDs at American institutions in any field. Research is a central element of Cornell's mission. In 2009 Cornell spent $671¬†million on science and engineering research and development. This makes it the 16th highest in the United States.
For the 2004‚Äì05 fiscal year, the university spent $561.3¬†million on research. Of Cornell's units, the largest amount of this funding went to the colleges of Medicine ($164.2¬†million), Agriculture and Life Sciences ($114.5¬†million), Arts and Sciences ($80.3¬†million), and Engineering ($64.8¬†million). The money comes largely from federal sources, with federal investment of $381.0¬†million. The federal agencies that invest the most money are the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Science Foundation that make up, respectively, 51.4% and 30.7% of all federal investment in the university. Cornell was on the top-ten list of U.S. universities receiving the most patents in 2003, and was one of the nation's top five institutions in forming start-up companies. In 2004‚Äì05, Cornell received 200 invention disclosures, filed 203 U.S. patent applications, completed 77 commercial license agreements, and distributed royalties of more than $4.1¬†million to Cornell units and inventors.
Since 1962, Cornell has been involved in unmanned missions to Mars. In the 21st century, Cornell had a hand in the Mars Exploration Rover Mission. Cornell's Steve Squyres, Principal Investigator for the Athena Science Payload, led the selection of the landing zones and requested data collection features for the Spirit and Opportunity rovers. Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineers took those requests and designed the rovers to meet them. The rovers, both of which have operated long past their original life expectancies, are responsible for the discoveries that were awarded 2004 Breakthrough of the Year honors by "Science". Control of the Mars rovers has shifted between NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech and Cornell's Space Sciences Building. Further, Cornell researchers discovered the rings around the planet Uranus. Also, Cornell built and operated the world's largest and most sensitive radiotelescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
In 1952, John O. Moore at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory began the Automotive Crash Injury Research project. (In 1972, the lab was separated from the University as Calspan Corporation.) It pioneered the use of crash testing, originally using corpses rather than dummies. The project discovered that improved door locks, energy-absorbing steering wheels, padded dashboards, and seat belts could prevent an extraordinary percentage of injuries. The project led Liberty Mutual to fund the building of a demonstration Cornell Safety Car in 1956, which received national publicity and influenced carmakers. Carmakers soon started their own crash-test laboratories and gradually adopted many of the Cornell innovations. Other ideas, such as rear-facing passenger seats, never found favor with carmakers or the public.
In 1984, the National Science Foundation began work on establishing five new supercomputer centers, including the Cornell Center for Advanced Computing, to provide high-speed computing resources for research within the United States. In 1985, a team from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications began the development of NSFNet, a TCP/IP-based computer network that could connect to the ARPANET, at the Cornell Center for Advanced Computing and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This high-speed network, unrestricted to academic users, became a backbone to which regional networks would be connected. Initially a 56-kbit/s network, traffic on the network grew exponentially; the links were upgraded to 1.5¬†Mbit/s T1s in 1988 and to 45¬†Mbit/s in 1991. The NSFNet was a major milestone in the development of the Internet and its rapid growth coincided with the development of the World Wide Web.
Cornell scientists have researched the fundamental particles of nature for more than 70 years. Cornell physicists, such as Hans Bethe, contributed not only to the foundations of nuclear physics but also participated in the Manhattan Project. In the 1930s, Cornell built the second cyclotron in the United States. In the 1950s, Cornell physicists became the first to study synchrotron radiation. During the 1990s, the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, beneath Alumni Field, was the world's highest-luminosity electron-positron collider. After building the synchrotron at Cornell, Robert R. Wilson took a leave of absence to become the founding director of Fermilab, which involved designing and building the Tevatron, the largest accelerator in the United States. Cornell's accelerator and high-energy physics groups are involved in the design of the proposed International Linear Collider and plan to participate in its construction and operation. The International Linear Collider, to be completed in the late 2010s, will complement the Large Hadron Collider and shed light on questions such as the identity of dark matter and the existence of extra dimensions.
In the area of humanities and social sciences, Cornell is best known for being one of the world's greatest centers for the study of Southeast Asia. The Southeast Asia Program (SEAP) at Cornell is designated as a National Resource Center (NRC) by the United States Department of Education 2010‚Äì2014. Therefore, the SEAP is nationally prominent in promoting advanced foreign language training, area and international knowledge in the liberal arts and applied discipline focused on Southeast Asia. The George McTurnan Kahin Center for Advanced Research on Southeast Asia is in the historic "Treman House." The George McTurnan Kahin Center is home to SEAP graduate students, visiting fellows and scholars, faculty members, and SEAP's Publication and Outreach offices.

Bolognese sauce

Bolognese sauce is a sauce made with meat that is then mixed with pasta before eating. It is called "Rag√π alla bolognese" in Italy. The sauce came from Bologna in Italy.
Most Italian people eat their Bolognese sauce with "tagliatelle", a broad, flat type of pasta. It can also be served with ribbon or tube shaped pasta.
In 1982, the Bolognese delegation, said that the recipe must only be made of beef, pancetta (a type of bacon), onions, carrots, celery, tomato paste, meat broth, red wine and milk or cream. There are different recipes of Bolognese sauce. Some of the recipes contain chopped pork or pork sausage. Mushrooms are sometimes added.
Spaghetti Bolognese is popular outside of Italy where the sauce is put on a plate of spaghetti with a little bit of grated cheese put on. In China Bolognese sauce is served with noodles and it is called Chinese spaghetti.
However, these different ways of making the recipe are never eaten in Bologna. They do use the recipe together with b√©chamel sauce to make lasagna.

Pug

The pug is a type of dog with a wrinkly face. It also has a curled tail, and pug puppies are called puglets. The pug has a square, muscular body with a large head, big eyes, and small ears. They have often been described as "multum in parvo", which means "much in little", referring to the pug's character and size. Pugs came originally from China, but they became popular in England, Ireland, and Scotland.
Pugs are often liked most for their curly tails, compact body, a deep chest, and strong muscles. There are two different types of a Pug's ears, "rose" and "button". "Rose" ears are smaller than the "button" ears and are folded up instead of on the side of the head. Most people prefer "button" style Pugs. Pugs have strong, straight legs and laid back shoulders. Their feet are not as large as a hare's foot, but they are not as round as that of a cat, either. They have toes that are split up perfectly, and their nails are all black. The lower teeth normally grow farther out than the upper teeth, so they meet in an under-bite.
The coat of pugs can be a lot of different colors, including fawn, apricot, silver, or black. A very rare pug is white. The fur color may be white due to albinism. There is also a smutty fawn pug, which has a very dark head and dark forelegs. The tail usually curls at the hip.
Different coat types shed differently, but they all shed year-round. The pug who has a fawn color sheds the most. Grooming their fur helps prevent too much shedding.
The pug is very strong-willed, but does not act aggressively unless provoked to a high degree. Pugs are well kept for families with children. They can be quiet and nice but also funny according to the owner's mood. They are also good at guarding the house.
Pugs came from China, as most high people of China kept them as pets during the Shang Dynasty (before 400 BCE).
In East China, they were known as the "Lo-Chiang-Sze" or "Foo". In the early 551 BCE, Confucius described the pug as a "short mouthed dog". After that, pugs became popular in Tibet, especially for monks. Then, pugs became known toward Japan and then Europe. The pug's origin is unknown because the first Emperor of China destroyed everything related to the pug in his reign. 
Chinese Fu-Dogs, also called Lion-Dogs or Fo-Dogs, were thought of as brave dogs who were skilled at guarding, so statues of them were placed outside the temples.
The Dutch East India Company imported the pug first in the late 16th and 17th centuries. Later, in 1572, a pug named Pompey saved the Prince of Orange by warning him when the Spaniards came. William III and Mary II also took a pug with them when they were going from Netherlands to England for the seat of the throne in 1688.
The pug was also becoming famous in other European countries as well. The Spanish painter, Goya, painted pugs in Spain and Italy sitting beside the coachmen of the rich. They were used as guard dogs and to find animals or people.
After that, pugs began to become popular in France. A pug named Fortune was a messenger between Jos√©phine de Beauharnais and her family while she was in prison. In Italy, the pug was becoming famous also. A Mrs. Piozzi wrote in her journal that "every carriage I meet here has a pug in it".
In 19th century England, Queen Victoria was a very sincere lover of pugs. She had many pet pugs, such as Olga, Pedro, Minka, Fatima, and Venus.
The pug finally arrived in the United States during the 19th century and soon became popular there as well. Many pugs won dog shows, and soon the Pug Dog Club was founded in 1931.
Because pugs do not have long snouts, they can get eye diseases. They also cannot breathe well, because passages for oxygen are very small and they cannot regulate their temperature with their tongue well. A pug's normal body temperature is between and . If the temperature rises to , they need to cool down immediately because they cannot cool themselves enough. If the temperature reaches , their organs can fail..net
Pugs that live by themselves can have the problem of overweight, although this can be helped by exercising and eating healthy food..net
Pugs can also be hurt by "necrotizing meningoencephalitis" (NME). NME is an inflammation of the brain and meninges. It is also known as "pug dog encephalitis" (PDE). There is no known cure or explanation for NME, although most people believe it is a disease that dogs may inherit from their mother or father. All dogs usually die within a few months after this disease, which usually happens from 6 months to 7 years of age..net
Pugs can also get a serious disease in their spine..net
Because pugs have wrinkles on their faces, owners must clean the folded part of their skin. Hip dysplasia is another major problem for pugs. About 63.8% of pugs were caught with hip dysplasia..net
When pugs get excited, they begin to "reverse sneeze", in which they will breathe in short, quick breaths. "Reverse sneezing" is usually not harmful to the pug. It can be helped by massaging the dog's throat or covering its nose to make it breathe instead with its mouth..net
Pugs have come out in television and film, such as Frank the Pug in the film "Men in Black" and the follow-up series. Other films that have pugs include "12 Rounds", "Marie Antoinette (2006 film)", and Disney's film about "Pocahontas". They have also appeared on television, in shows like "The West Wing".
Pugs have also appeared in many fictional books, like Lady Bertram's pug in "Mansfield Park" and in the book "Pugs: God's Little Weirdos".
Famous people who own pugs include broadcaster Jonathan Ross and actress Jessica Alba.

Command economy

A command economy, or a planned economy, is where the big decisions are made at the centre by the government.
In an economic system the main decisions are, for example, allocating resources like labour, capital and oil. Prices, too, are controlled. In a command economy, these decisions are taken by a central body, usually the government. This system contrasts that of a market economy where all the economic actors involved take decisions. The benefit of a planned economy is that the planning body has (supposedly) perfect information, and can make a better decision than in the market economy. Countries at war sometimes command their people to make things the war needs.
Friedrick von Hayek, a 20th-century economist, pointed out that it is not possible for the planning body to have perfect information. For this reason, the decisions taken by this body will be wrong, as it is not possible to foresee all possible events. Once the decision has been taken there is only a small margin to vary the production; this means that a planned economy cannot adapt to a change as rapidly as a market economy. According to Ludwig von Mises, there is no competition, and there are no reasons to innovate or to look for different solutions to a problem, in a planned economy.
Communism is a type of government system that would use a command economy. Countries with command economies include Burma, Cuba, Iran, Liberia, and North Korea. Formerly, the Soviet Union and China were command economies, and are now mixed economies where the government still has a major influence.

Charles Ives

Charles Edward Ives (October 30, 1874 ‚Äì May 19, 1954) was an American composer. He experimented with new ways of composing which many people did not understand at the time. These became more widely used later in the century. He used dissonant (harsh) sounding intervals and techniques such as polytonality (playing in several keys at once), polyrhythms (several rhythms at once) and polytextures (several textures at once). Very few people listened to his music at the time he was writing it. Only much later did musicians start to realize the importance of his work. Ives earned his living as an insurance agent. He composed in his spare time.
Charles Ives was born in Danbury, Connecticut. His father George Ives, was a U.S. Army bandleader in the American Civil War. His mother was a singer. His father taught him a great deal about the music and encouraged him to experiment with new sounds. As well as teaching him counterpoint and introducing him to the music of J.S.Bach he trained his son‚Äôs musical ear by getting him to sing a tune in one key while he played the accompaniment in another. In this way the young Charles became used to modern sounds that were quite different from traditional, Romantic music. Charles also listened in Danbury town square to his father's marching band and other bands that were playing on other sides of the square, so that he heard a mixture of several pieces of music at the same time. His father also taught him the music of Stephen Foster. 
Ives became a church organist at the age of 14 and wrote various hymns and songs for church services, including his "Variations on 'America' ". At the same time he also enjoyed sport and was good at baseball, football and tennis.
Ives spent four years at Yale University. His teacher Horatio Parker was very good and taught him important basic techniques of composing, but he could not understand some of things that Ives was writing in his music. Ives got annoyed when his teacher told him he could not finish a section of music on a dissonant chord, but Ives liked it like that. The choirmaster at the Centre Church where Ives played the organ was John Griggs. He had more understanding of what Ives was trying to do. It was a terrible blow to Charles when his father died on 4 November 1894. He always had a huge admiration for his father who had encouraged him in his musical experiments. Charles kept busy composing. He did not do any sport at Yale because his father had forbidden him to take part in sport so that he would spend his time on studying. By the time Charles graduated he had composed more than 40 songs, several marches, overtures, anthems and organ pieces, a string quartet and a symphony. However, most people thought of him as the composer of a simple waltz tune called "The Bells of Yale". 
After his studies at Yale Ives continued to work as a church organist while working for an insurance firm. He was very good at his job and became very well known in the insurance business. Some of his business friends were often surprised to find out that he was also a composer. 
In 1907, Ives had his first "heart attack". These attacks may have been more to do with his imagination. When he was better he composed more than ever before. He married in 1908. After several heart attacks in 1918 he composed very little. He stopped composing altogether in 1926. His health problems continued, and he retired from the insurance business in 1930. He spent some time revising works he had written early, but never wrote any more new pieces.
Ives died in 1954 in New York City at 12:32 PM
Ives published more than 100 of his songs. He was a very good pianist and the piano parts are often quite difficult. They include bitonality and pantonality.. Although he is now best known for his orchestral music, he composed two string quartets and other chamber music. His organ piece "Variations on "America"" (1891), takes the tune "My Country, 'Tis of Thee" (which is the same tune as "God Save the Queen ") and changes it in several amusing variations, using a march, a ragtime and bitonality. it was not published until 1949. The variations differ sharply: a running line, a set of close harmonies, a march, a polonaise, and a ragtime allegro; the interludes are one of the first uses of bitonality.
His "Symphony Number 1" was fairly traditional, but "Symphony Number 2" is much more modern sounding, even ending with a dissonant chord with 11 notes.
In 1902 he gave up his organ job. He left all his best anthems and organ music in the church library, and these were thrown out in 1915 when the church moved so most of them are lost.
"Central Park in the Dark" is a piece for orchestra which describes the mysterious, quiet park and then sounds of music coming from nearby nightclubs in Manhattan (playing the popular music of the day, ragtime, quoting "Hello My Baby" and even Sousa's "Washington Post March"). 
Perhaps the piece which is most often heard today is the short fanfare "The Unanswered Question" (1908), written for the very unusual combination of trumpet, four flutes, and string orchestra. The strings, playing from behind the stage, play very slow, chorale-like music throughout the piece while several times the trumpet (playing from behind the audience) plays a short group of notes that Ives described as "the eternal question of existence". Each time the trumpet is answered with harsh outbursts from the flutes (onstage) ‚Äî apart from the last one. That is the question that is left unanswered. Musicians often have discussions about what the real meaning of the piece is.
Another well-known orchestral work is "Three Places in New England". His best-known piano work is his "Concord Sonata". Ives often liked to quote bits of other pieces, and in this piano sonata he quotes the famous opening of Beethoven's "Fifth Symphony". It also has an interesting example of one of Ives' experiments: in the second movement, he tells the pianist to use a 14¬æ¬†in (37.5¬†cm) piece of wood to make a thick but soft cluster chord. The sonata is one of the best piano works of the 20th century. 
One of his most interesting works is the his "Fourth Symphony" (1910‚Äì16) written for a huge orchestra. The last movement is like a fight between discord and traditional tonal music. The piece ends quietly with just the percussion playing at a distance. This symphony seems to say everything that Ives had been trying to do in music. It was not until 1965 that a complete performance of the symphony was given. 
Ives‚Äô music only gradually began to get well known during the 1930s and into the 1940s. Schoenberg recognized his importance. In 1951, Leonard Bernstein conducted the first performance of Ives' Second Symphony in a broadcast concert by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. He recorded a lot of his music and even played some in a television programme for young people.

Flageolet

A flageolet is an old woodwind instrument. It belongs to the end-blown flute family. It started to be used in the 16th century for folk music. Soon there were two kinds: the French kind and the English. The French flageolet had four holes in the front and two in the back. The English flageolet had six holes in the front.
The flageolet is quite similar to the recorder. In the 18th century it changed because a narrow mouthpiece made of ivory or bone was added at the top. This led into another section which bulged out. There was a soft sponge at the end of this. Sometimes this instrument was called the "flautino". The piccolo developed from it. Another instrument that developed from it was the tin whistle.
Henry Purcell and George Frideric Handel both wrote pieces for it. 
Small versions of this instrument, called bird flageolets were also made and were used for teaching birds to sing.

Paris Op√©ra

Paris Op√©ra or the Op√©ra National de Paris is the most important opera company of France. It stages performances at the Op√©ra Bastille and Op√©ra Garnier in Paris. The theatre is also the home of the Paris Op√©ra Ballet.
Other opera houses in Paris are the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet, Op√©ra-Comique and Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es.
King Louis XIV allowed Jean-Baptiste Lully to start the "Acad√©mie Royale de Musique" in 1672. This was an organization that included opera, ballet, and music. The ballet company was part of the opera company. Then Louis XIV started the ballet school, called "Acad√©mie Royale de Danse", in 1661. From 1671 until Lully's death in 1687, the school was directed by the great dancing master Pierre Beauchamp, the man who set down the five positions of the feet. 
In 1713 King Louis XIV made the Opera company a state institution. There was a group of professional dancers called "Le Ballet de l'Op√©ra". From that time until 1875 they used lots of theatres, each one of which was destroyed by a fire. All these companies were called Paris Op√©ra or Op√©ra de Paris.
On 29 October 1873, the old "Paris Op√©ra", known as the "Th√©√¢tre de l'Acad√©mie Royale de Musique", which had been used since 1821, was destroyed by a fire which burned for 27 hours. By 1875 the opera company moved to the new "Palais Garnier" which was part of the rebuilding of Paris by Emperor Napoleon III.
When the "Op√©ra Bastille" was built in 1989 the company chose it as their main theatre.

Faust

Faust or Faustus is a character from German legendary stories. His name comes from a Latin word meaning "lucky". The legend is about a man called Faust. Faust wants to have knowledge. He meets the Devil. The Devil tells Faust he can have anything he wants. In return, the Devil says, Faust must give him his soul. Faust agrees, and the Devil lets Faust have a wonderful time, but in the end Faust has to go to Hell.
The story of Faust became famous all over Europe. Many writers from different countries wrote their own versions of the Faust story, e.g. Christopher Marlowe, Goethe, Mikhail Bulgakov, Thomas Mann. Many composers wrote music about Faust, e.g. Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, Charles Gounod and Ferrucio Busoni.
The adjective "Faustian" is used to describe a person who wants something so much that it leads them into trouble.
In the early versions of the Faust story: in ballads, dramas and puppet-plays, Faust is always damned (meaning he will have to go to Hell). This is because he prefers human knowledge instead of God‚Äôs knowledge. This was thought to be very bad at that time.
Some of the plays and comic puppet theatre from around the 16th century make up their own versions of the story. They often show Faust as a figure of vulgar fun. The story became popular in England when Christopher Marlowe wrote a play called The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus. But in Goethe's version of the story two centuries later, Faust is described as a well-educated man who wants more than just "meat and drink."

<doc id="146764" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146764" title="Austin Motor Company">
Austin Motor Company

Austin was a British car manufacturing company that began production in 1905. The company merged with Morris in 1952, becoming the lead partner in British Motor Corporation. This became British Leyland and then Rover Group. They began phasing the brand out in 1987; by 1989 all Rover Group cars had been cleared of Austin branding. The name has now passed into the ownership of Nanjing Motor Corporation, who have stated an interest in reviving it.
The company was started in 1905 by Herbert Austin, originally making cars at a factory in Rotherham, Yorkshire before moving to Longbridge, Birmingham. In the First World War Austin made aircraft for the Army and Navy, it was this work which led to the rapid expansion of the company; following the war the company stopped making aircraft. The company became Britain's biggest car maker.
In 1952 Austin merged with its biggest rival Morris (founded by William Morris, afterwards Lord Nuffield), with Austin being the lead partner. This company was known as the British Motor Corporation (BMC). Following the merger with Morris, the model line up for Austin changed considerably. The most notable car to come from this era was the Austin Mini, this was also sold as a Morris Mini and was made up until 2000 (though not as an Austin after 1987). Austin enjoyed a favourable market share during the 1950s and 1960s.
In 1968 BMC merged with Leyland (Leyland, Standard and Triumph) to become British Leyland even though Leyland had been a much smaller firm. It was the British Leyland years that were perhaps the most difficult and in 1975 British Leyland was nationalised. Austin's market share fell, as did other marques within the company, leading to the phasing out of the Morris name plate in 1981. There were many strikes at British Leyland's factories, making British Leyland and other companies with the same problem, such as the Ford Motor Company unproductive compared to Japanese and European companied like Volkswagen. Many of the models in this era failed to sell well, either because they were old fashioned or deemed unreliable; the Austin Princess and the Austin Allegro were the only modern cars of this era, while the 1300, 1800 and Austin Maxi were all dated. The Princess and Allegro sold well, but both were saloons, and the only hatchback the company had was the Maxi, which wasn't a popular car.
British Leyland became the Rover Group in 1986. Despite the huge success of the Austin Metro, launched in 1980, there was trouble in the company. In the 1980s Austin sold the most cars in the British Leyland group, however when the company became Rover Group, a greater emphasis was placed on the more upmarket Rover name. In 1987 the company began phasing the name out and by 1989 it had been removed from all products.
The name now belongs to Nanjing Motor Corporation who have expressed an interest in reviving it. They currently make cars as MGs (the MG marque came from Morris and consisted of three sports cards MGA, MGB and MGC), however it intends to use this brand name for luxury cars and sports cars. Nanjing does not own the Rover name, so the Austin name is the most recent it has to use for its mainstream mass market cars.
The company's most famous models were the Austin Seven (1922-39), the Austin A30 (1951-56), the Austin A35 (1956-59), the Austin A55 Cambridge (1954-71), the Austin Mini (1959-2000 but only as an Austin until 1969), the Austin 1800 (1964-75), the Austin 1300 (1967-74), Austin Maxi (1969-81), Austin Allegro (1973-83), Austin Princess/Ambassador (1975-84), Austin Metro (1980-1998 but only as an Austin until 1987), Austin Maestro (1983-94), Austin Montego (1984-94).

Crescent and star

The Islamic Crescent is a symbol consisting of a crescent with a star at the concave side. In its modern form, the star is usually shown with five points (though in earlier centuries a higher number of points was often used). The two signs together, or the crescent only, was long a symbol of Byzantium. Now it is often a symbol of Islam. It is seen on a number of different country flags such as Turkey.
Flag of Ottoman Empire was the first flag featuring a crescent with a star. Other states formerly part of the Ottoman Empire also used the symbol, so the symbol emerged into popular use.

Cootamundra, New South Wales

Cootamundra is a town in New South Wales, Australia. In 2006 there were 5,566 people living in Cootamundra. It is on the Olympic Highway where it crosses the Muttama Creek, between Junee and Cowra. Cootamundra's railway station is on the main Melbourne-to-Sydney railway line.
Sir Donald Bradman AC, Australian cricketer said to be the greatest batsman of all time was born in Cootamundra. The town is very proud of Bradman, and uses this in signs and tourist information. The home where "The Don" was born is a fully restored visitor site open to the public seven days per week.
Cootamundra is the home of the Cootamundra Wattle (Acacia Baileyana). Every year there is a large 'Wattle Time' Festival (which happens when the wattle starts to bloom) with an art show and festivities.

Acacia baileyana

The Cootamundra Wattle is an Australian shrub or tree. It is in the Family Fabaceae. The tree's Latin name, "Acacia baileyana", is named after the botanist Frederick Manson Bailey. It is one of nearly 1000 species of "Acacia" found in Australia. The Cootamundra Wattle at first only came from a small area in southern New South Wales near Cootamundra. It has been widely planted all over Australia. In many areas of Victoria Cootamundra Wattle has become a weed. It is taking over from acacias that were only found in Victorian. 
Almost all wattles have cream to golden colored flowers. The small flowers are arranged in round to cylindrical clusters. Only the stamens, the male part of the flower, stick out. Many wattles have been planted in New Zealand.
"A. baileyana" is used in Europe in the cut flower industry. It is also used as food for bees in making honey. 
This plant is easy to grow. It can adapt and grow in different areas. Unfortunately it easily produces seeds and will start growing new plants in the surrounding area. It can also cross breed with other acacias, including the rare and endangered Sydney species "Acacia pubescens".
A low growing, weeping form, is being grown. The fine leaves of the original Cootamundra wattle is grey-green. A new type with blue-purple leaves, known as 'Purpurea' is very popular.

John O'Meally

John O'Meally (1841 ‚Äì 19 November 1863) was an Australian bushranger and criminal. He was one of Frank Gardiner's gang who robbed the gold escort coach at Eugowra. This was Australia's biggest gold robbery.
O'Meally worked as a stockman, looking after cattle and sheep on his father's farm, Arramagong Station in the Lachlan River valley. His father, Paddy O'Meally, also ran a shanty (a very basic hotel), called "The Weddin Inn", on Emu Creek. The inn was the only hotel in the district. John OMeally, and another one of Gardiner's gang, Alex Fordyce, sometimes worked at the shanty. The gold escort robbery was planned there.
On 15 June 1862 the gold escort coach that took the gold from the goldfields of Forbes to Bathurst was robbed. This was one of Australia's biggest robberies. O'Meally and several of his friends were in the gang led by Frank Gardiner. A week after the robbery the police, led by Sir Frederick Pottinger, captured two of the robbers, Henry Manns, and Charlie Gilbert. Charlie Gilbert was the brother of gang member John Gilbert. John Gilbert had nearly been captured but was able to escape. He went straight to "The Weddin Inn", and together with Ben Hall and O'Meally, captured the police and released the prisoners.
In July 1863, O'Meally and Gilbert tried to rob the bank at Carcoar in broad daylight. This is believed to be the first daylight bank robbery in Australia.
On 30 August 1863, O'Meally tried to rob John Barnes near Wallendbeen station (farm). Barnes owned shops in Cootamundra and Murrumburrah. O'Meally tried to take Barnes' saddle. Barnes rode off to try and get away, but O'Meally shot and killed him. Barnes is buried in the Cootamundra cemetery.
O'Meally was shot and killed while trying to rob Goimbla station (farm) near Eugowra, on 19 November 1863. This event became known as the "Battle of Goimbla." The Campbell family fought off the Ben Hall gang in during a two-hour battle. The National Museum of Australia has several items in its collection about the battle.
John O'Meally is buried in an unmarked grave in the Anglican cemetery at Gooloogong.

<doc id="146862" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146862" title="Goethe's Faust">
Goethe's Faust

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust is the most famous play in all German literature. It was published in two parts. Part One is very dramatic, and tells the main story. Part II is extremely long, and it is meant to be read rather than acted on stage. It is about Goethe‚Äôs philosophy as well as about history and politics.
Goethe‚Äôs "Faust" is a re-telling of the Faust legend which was very famous in Germany. The legend tells of a man called Faust who is tired of studying and wants to have the greatest possible happiness. The devil (usually called Mephistopheles, as he is in Goethe‚Äôs play) tells Faust he can help him to do this, but that in the end Faust will have to give him his soul and go with him to hell. Faust makes a pact (an agreement) with Mephistopheles who promises him all his soul can wish for: fine living, gold, women and honour. Faust signs the pact with his blood. Faust uses magic in the hope that it will tell him everything about life. However, in the end Mephistopheles wins his bet.
The subject of "Faust" occupied Goethe all his life. The name of Faust is mentioned in a comedy he wrote in 1769: ‚ÄúDie Mitschuldigen‚Äú. In 1773, when he was 24, he first read the poetry of Hans Sachs, the medieval German poet. He immediately started to imitate the rhythm of Sachs‚Äôs poetry. This rhythm is known as ‚ÄúKnittelvers‚Äù. It had 4 accented syllables in each line and an AABB or ABAB rhyming pattern, e.g.
In 1887, long after Goethe‚Äôs death, it was discovered that he had made a version of ‚ÄúFaust‚Äú which he never published but later decided to rewrite. This version is known as the ‚ÄúUrfaust‚Äù (‚ÄúUr‚Äù means ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù, i.e. the ‚ÄúOriginal Faust‚Äù). It was written between 1772 and 1775. He changed a lot of it and it became ‚ÄúFaust Part I‚Äú. A fragment (small part of it) was published in 1790. Then he finished it in 1806, published it in 1808 and changed it for a new edition in 1829. Part 2 was finished in 1831, a few months before he died, and was not published until a few months after his death.
"Faust Part One" starts off in heaven. Mephistopheles makes a bet with God: he says that he can go down to earth and meet Faust and make him do bad things.
We then see Faust in his study. Faust is trying to get to know all possible things. He wants to know about science, humans and religion. He tries to use magic in order to understand everything there is to know, but he thinks he is not managing to do it. For a moment he thinks of killing himself, but then hears people celebrating Easter and decides to go for a walk with Wagner, his assistant. A poodle who has no home follows Faust back to his house.
In Faust‚Äôs study, the poodle changes into the devil (Mephistopheles). Faust makes an arrangement with the devil: the devil will do everything that Faust wants while he is here on earth, In exchange Faust will serve the devil in hell. Faust's arrangement is that if during the time while Mephistopheles is serving Faust, Faust is so pleased with anything the devil gives him that he wants to stay in that moment forever, he will die that very moment (in German he says: ‚ÄúVerweile doch, du bist so sch√∂n‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúStay a while, you are so beautiful‚Äù. It is perhaps the most famous quotation in all German literature.)
Mephistopheles persuades Faust to sign the agreement with his own blood. Faust has a few adventures and then meets Margaret (also known as Gretchen). He loves her, and by offering her jewellery, and with help of a neighbour, Martha, Gretchen lets herself into Faust's arms. Faust and Gretchen want to sleep together, so Gretchen gives her mother a sleeping potion so that she does not see Faust. Faust and Gretchen sleep together. Gretchen‚Äôs mother dies of the potion. Gretchen discovers she is pregnant. Gretchen‚Äôs brother says Faust is bad and challenges him, but Faust kills him (with the devil‚Äôs help, of course). Gretchen has given birth to a baby, but she drowns it. She is found guilty of murder and is sent to prison. Faust tries to save her from death, but he cannot free her from prison. Finding that they cannot free her, Faust and the devil run away from the prison cell, while voices from heaven say that Gretchen shall be saved.
"Faust Part Two" is very different from Part One. It keeps referring to classical literature. The romantic story of the first Faust is forgotten, and Faust wakes in a field of fairies. He has many adventures. The piece is in five acts which each tell of different things. In the end Faust goes to heaven, because he loses only half the bet. Angels, who arrive as messengers of God‚Äôs mercy, say at the end of Act 5: "He who strives on and lives to strive/ Can earn redemption still" (i.e. anyone who tries hard in life can still be saved).
Goethe‚Äôs "Faust" had an enormous influence on all art in Western countries. In Germany many writers were fascinated by the legend. They often felt that Faust represented the spirit of the German people. Dramas, epic poems and novels were written about Faust. Composers wrote operas or orchestral music about him. Thomas Mann wrote a novel "Dr Faustus" which compares Faust‚Äôs pact with the devil to the way the German people supported Hitler.

Killing of Peter Fechter

Peter Fechter (14 January 1944 - 17 August 1962) is one of the best known victims of the Berlin Wall. Fechter was a bricklayer. Aged 18, he tried to cross the wall into the West, near Checkpoint Charlie, to live with his sister. He did this with his friend and colleague, Helmut Kulbeik. Both started to climb the wall at around 14:15. Kubelik was successful, and could escape. Fechter was hit by several gunshots, one of which pierced his lung, and fell back down, to what was called the "Death strip". He was unable to move, and started to cry for help. Crowds started to gather on both sides of the wall; on the east side, they were dispersed by police.
Police gathered on the west side threw medical kits to him; despite the crowd asking them, they would not do more. The DDR border guards did not do anything either; neither did the United States personnel on duty at the Checkpoint.
Fechter bled to death after about an hour. After reunification, two border police were found guilty of manslaughter. They were convicted and given suspended prison terms of 20 and 21 months respectively. Both had told the court they fired shots at Fechter, but did not want to kill him. The court also ruled that Fechter was killed by the shots, and not by the absence of aid. The evidence could not show who of three gunman (one had already died) was responsible for the bullet that killed Fechter.

Manchester Metrolink

Manchester Metrolink (or usually just Metrolink) is the name of the tram system in Greater Manchester, England. The system is owned by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM), which used to be called the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE). It is operated under contract by the RATP Group.
The construction of Manchester's railway network in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries had created a lot of termini around the City Centre. These were not linked together. This left a large amount of Manchester disconnected from the railway network.
For many years there had been plans to connect Manchester's two main railway stations. These are Piccadilly and Victoria. In the late 1960s and early 1970s there were plans for a "Picc-Vic tunnel". This tunnel would carry main-line trains under the city centre. The proposal was abandoned because it would cost too much.
Metrolink was created by converting two British Rail lines serving the suburbs of Manchester, one to the town of Altrincham to the south, and another to the town of Bury to the north, to light rail. These two lines were joined up in Manchester city centre, where trams run on the roads, and had a short branch to Piccadilly railway station. This first section of the new system opened in 1992, and a newer line to Eccles opened in 2001.
Lots of extensions to the system have opened since then, with more that are currently being built or proposed. Metrolink now has lines that serve Didsbury, Ashton-under-Lyne, Oldham, Rochdale, MediaCityUK and Manchester Airport. These expansions increased the system's length from 37¬†km to 97¬†km with 99¬†stops. Sometime in 2017 there will be a second line through Manchester city centre serving Exchange Square, and another line towards the Trafford Centre shopping mall before the end of the decade. There are also plans for tram-train lines to Stockport and other places in Greater Manchester.

Nitrate (NO) is a polyatomic ion. It is made up of one nitrogen and three oxygen atoms. It is part of many important molecules. Potassium nitrate is a common nitrate, used in fertilizers because plants need nitrates to live and grow. Some nitrates are explosive. People make large amounts of nitrates from ammonia. Nitrates are similar to nitrites. Many metal nitrates with thermal decomposition makes oxygen and metal nitrate.
Nitric acid has the formula HNO and has no overall charge, because the hydrogen ion is positive.

Queanbeyan, New South Wales

Queanbeyan is a city in New South Wales, Australia. It is also the local government area called Queanbeyan City Council. It is very close to the Australian federal capital city of Canberra. It is really now a part of the capital city as it is on the Australian Capital Territory border and is only from Canberra's CBD. The border itself is marked by a railway line. The Queanbeyan River flows through Queanbeyan, near the centre of the city.
The town grew from a farm owned by ex-convict inn keeper, Timothy Beard. It was on the banks of the Molonglo River. The original name was "Quinbean" which means "clear waters".
Queanbeyan became a township in 1838. There were about 50 people living there. Some of the important historic buildings still standing were built in the early days. Traces of gold were found in 1851. There were also some lead and silver mines. Settlers were often robbed by bushrangers including John Tennant, Jacky Jacky, Frank Gardiner and Ben Hall. In 1836, the government built a Post Office at Queanbeyan. 
The first bank was opened in Queanbeyan on 19 September, 1859. This was the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited which is now part of the National Australia Bank. "The Golden Age" now called "The Queanbeyan Age" was Queanbeyan's first newspaper started in 1860 by John Gale. In 1880 John James Wright, the first mayor of Queanbeyan, built a house on the banks of the Queanbeyan River. In 1982 house became the Queanbeyan Art Centre.
The railway reached Queanbeyan railway station in 1887 and it became the junction for the lines going to Canberra and Bombala. There are now two trains a day, the Countrylink Xplorer service between Canberra and Sydney.
Queanbeyan became an important country town, with 16 hotels and six flour mills powered by wind, water, horse and steam. Canberra was started as the national capital in 1911. There were no hotels, so people crossed the border to get a drink at Queanbeyan's hotels. When the Parliament moved to Canberra from Melbourne in 1926, Canberra got it's first hotel. 
Queanbeyan became a city on 7 July, 1972. From 1982 to 1989, the Canberra Raiders rugby league team played their home games in Queanbeyan, at Seiffert Oval.

The flight's route had been changed without the crew's knowledge shortly before the plane took off. Because the weather conditions of the Antarctic were so bad (severely limiting visibility), and the crew believed they were following the original flight plan-the plane crashed straight into Mount Erebus. None of the 257 people on board the plane survived the crash. The original investigation showed it was the pilot's fault, but people protested and it led to an inquiry into the crash. The conclusion was the accident was caused by a correction made to the route the night before the disaster, and they failed to inform pilot Captain Jim Collins and co-pilot Greg Cassin.

Amborella trichopoda is a small, evergreen, deciduous shrub. It occurs only in the moist, shaded understory of montane forests on the South Pacific island of New Caledonia. The genus is the only member of the family Amborellaceae and contains only this single species. 
"Amborella" is of great interest to plant systematists because molecular phylogenetic analyses put it at or near the base of the flowering plant lineage.
Since "Amborella" is apparently basal among the flowering plants, the features of early flowering plants can be inferred. This is done by comparing derived traits shared by other angiosperms but not present in "Amborella". These traits are assumed to have evolved after the divergence of the "Amborella" lineage.
The Amborellaceae are a line of flowering plants that diverged very early on (about 130 million years ago) from all the other living species of flowering plants. Among living flowering plants, it is the sister group to all other flowering plants.

God is dead

"God is dead" (German: ; also known as the death of God) is a well known phrase by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. 
Friedrich Nietzsche wrote this in his book "The Gay Science". It is also found in Nietzsche's classic work "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" (Deutsch: "Also sprach Zarathustra"), which is most responsible for popularizing the phrase. 
The phrase is not meant literally.
The idea is stated in "The Madman" as follows
"God is dead" does not mean that Nietzsche believed in an actual God who first existed and then died in a literal sense. It refers to the growth of non-believers in supposedly Christian countries.
"When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one's feet. This morality is by no means self-evident... By breaking one main concept out of Christianity, the faith in God, one breaks the whole: nothing necessary remains in one's hands". This is why in "The Madman", the passage quoted above mainly addresses nontheists (especially atheists).

Jean-Fran√ßois Le Sueur

Jean-Fran√ßois Le Sueur (or Lesueur) (15 February 1760 ‚Äî 6 October 1837) was a French composer, best known for his oratorios and operas.
Jean-Fran√ßois Le Sueur was born in a tiny village called Plessiel, near Abbeville. His great-uncle was the painter Eustache Le Sueur. He started his musical training by singing in the choir at the church of Abbeville, then at the cathedral of Amiens. Le Sueur became chorus master at the cathedral of S√©es. He went to Paris to study harmony. His teacher was Abb√© Nicolas Roze, chorus master at the church Saints-Innocents. Le Sueur got jobs at Dijon (1779), Le Mans (1782), Tours (1783) and then took over Roze‚Äôs job at the Saints-Innocents at Paris. In 1786 he was made music director at the famous church Notre-Dame de Paris.
At Notre Dame he started to use orchestras to play the music for some of the special services. The priests did not like this. Le Sueur replied by writing a little book about music for big religious celebrations. It was a bad time in France financially and the church had to make savings, so Le Sueur could not have his orchestra any more, so he resigned from his job.
Le Sueur spent some time in London, 1788-92, then returned to Paris where the revolution was going on. Three of his operas were performed, and he became professor at the √âcole de la Garde Nationale, and then at the Conservatoire which was very new at the time. There he taught basic music theory. He was unable to get any more operas of his performed. He wrote a book saying how music should be taught in France, and criticizing the Conservatoire and its director. Because of that he lost his job at the Conservatoire. 
Le Sueur now had no job and so he was very poor. Then, in 1804, Napoleon made him ma√Ætre de la chapelle at the Tuileries in the place of Giovanni Paisiello. He was then able to have his most famous work performed at the Op√©ra. It was called "Ossian ou Les bardes". Napoleon liked it very much and gave Le Sueur the cross of the L√©gion d'honneur. Le Sueur composed the "Triumphal March" for the coronation of Napoleon. In 1813, he was given a position at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts, replacing Andr√© Gr√©try.
At the Bourbon Restoration, he was named composer of the royal chapel and conductor of the orchestra of the Op√©ra. From the beginning of 1818, he taught composition at the Conservatoire. He stayed there many years. His most famous pupils were Hector Berlioz, Ambroise Thomas and Charles Gounod.
He died in Paris.

Anton Reicha (born 26 February 1770; died 28 May 1836) was a Czech-born composer who became naturalized French. He was a lifelong friend of Beethoven.
Reicha is now best remembered for the large number of quintets that he wrote for wind instruments, and for his work as a music teacher. Franz Liszt and Hector Berlioz were both pupils of Reicha. Reicha wrote several books about music theory and composition.

British Rail Class 02

The British Rail Class 02 were a class of twenty 0-4-0 diesel-hydraulic shunting locomotives. They were built by the Yorkshire Engine Company in 1960 (first ten, D2850-D2859) and 1961 (D2860-D2869). They were built for use in places of restricted loading gauge and curves such as docks. They had the door to the cab at the rear, with a railed veranda behind the cab. This feature was very unusual on British Rail locomotives. It was used on many Yorkshire Engine Co. designs and was/is quite normal in North American practice.

Bureaucrats perform vital tasks. They need to be professional. They need to make hard decisions which could ultimately infuriate many other users. Who would want that job? Well many people actually. We don‚Äôt have enough. There are only three (, and ) bureaucrats, one of which is not very active at all. There are only two options I can see to remedy this situation.
So what is to be done? A discussion has to take place on the best course of action. 
My recommendation is to list every active admin (non-bureaucrat) and look at every one and then decide who to promote. Being an admin is no big deal, so why should being a bureaucrat be such a big deal that two highly respected admins are opposed in an RfB on such flimsy grounds?
Lets move with the times and promote the best in our community to Bureaucrat. We need a discussion about the whole RfA/B procedure, to ensure the process is the best it can be.

The British Rail Class 04 0-6-0 diesel-mechanical shunting locomotive class was built between 1952 and 1962. It was the basis for the later Class 03 built in the British Railways workshops. The Class 04 locomotives were supplied by the Drewry Car Co., which at the time (and for most of its existence) had no manufacturing capability. Drewry sub-contracted the construction work to two builders. Both of these built other locomotives under the same arrangement. Early locomotives were built by Vulcan Foundry and later examples were built by Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns.

Tajik people

Tajiks ( "TƒÅjƒ´k") are a Persian-speaking people who are mostly found in what is now Tajikistan, including in parts of Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, some Tajik refugees escaped to live in neighboring Iran and Pakistan. Most Tajiks are Sunni Muslims, but a few in remote mountain areas follow Shia Islam.
The Tajiks are some what similar to Iranians in appearance and culture, they make up almost 80% of Tajikistan's total population. In the early 21st century there were about 6 million Tajiks in Tajikistan and more than 1 million in Uzbekistan. There were about 5 million in Afghanistan. Another 40,000 lived in the Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang in China.
The name "Tajik" being used for this group of people began in the early 20th century by the Russians. Before that, they were called "Sarts". The name "Tajik" refers to the traditionally sedentary people who speak a form of Persian language called "Tajiki" in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and who speak today's Dari language in Afghanistan.
It is generally accepted that the origin of the word "Tajik" is Middle Persian "TƒÅzƒ´k" "Arab" (New Persian: "Tazi"), or an Iranian (Sogdian or Parthian) cognate word. Some Turks of Central Asia adopted a variant of this word, "T√§≈æik", to designate the Persian Muslims in the Oxus basin and Khorasan, who were the Turks' rivals. 
Historians believe that some Tajiks may be connected to ancient Aryans who lived in the region for thousands of years. They were the heirs and transmitters of the Central Asian sedentary culture that diffused in prehistoric times from the Iranian plateau into an area extending roughly from the Caspian Sea to the borders of China. The Aryans constituted the core of the ancient population of Khwarezm, Sogdiana and Bactria, which formed part of Transoxania. They were included in the empires of Persia and Alexander the Great, and they mixed with later invaders like the Mauryans, Kushans and Hepthalites. Over the course of time, the language that was used by these ancient people eventually gave way to Farsi, a western dialect spoken in Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan. In the 13th century, Genghis Khan and his Mongol army settled in many of the popular Persian cities after whiping out the Persian population. These Mongols later adopted the Persian language and the religion of Islam. Tajiks usually reject Mongol origin and claim to be ancient Persians but this is difficult to prove.

Production started in 1953 and when it finished in 1962, the class had become the most numerous of all British classes, numbering 996 in total. There were also 26 of the near-identical but higher geared Class 09, and 171 similar locomotives fitted with different engines and transmissions (some of which became Class 10), which together brought the total number of outwardly-similar machines to 1193.
Since their introduction, rail freight has primarily moved to fixed-rate bulk freight traffic and intermodal freight operations which reduce or remove the need for shunting, therefore only a few class 08 locomotives remain in service today.

Yellow fever is an illness which is caused by a virus. The illness can cause bleeding problems. It is called yellow because the skin sometimes becomes yellow, like it does with jaundice.
There is a vaccine which can stop the disease, but many people in Africa and South America are not vaccinated against it. The World Health Organization say that 200,000 people are made ill with yellow fever every year, and that 30,000 people die from it. 
Yellow peaked in 1842, killing hundreds of people. There was an outbreak in Philadelphia in 1793.
Yellow fever is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. The name of the mosquito which commonly carries the virus is "Aedes aegypti". The female carries the disease.

Op√©ra-Comique

The Op√©ra-Comique is an opera house and opera company in Paris. Its full name is th√©√¢tre national de l‚ÄôOp√©ra-Comique ("National Op√©ra Comic Theatre").
The Op√©ra-Comique company was started in 1714 to give somewhere to perform French operas. At the time operas throughout Europe were nearly always in Italian. Op√©ra-comique (literally: Comic opera) was a French tradition. The operas in this tradition were performed with spoken dialogue between the musical numbers. This is why the opera house and company were given that name.
The Op√©ras-Comiques were more popular and less formal that the traditional Italian operas that were performed at the Acad√©mie Royale de Musique. During the three centuries of its existence there have been several changes to it. For a time the Op√©ra-Comique and the Op√©ra were organized by the same institution.
The Op√©ra-Comique put on first performances of many famous operas, especially Bizet's "Carmen" on 3 March 1875 and Debussy's only opera, "Pell√©as et M√©lisande", on 30 April 1902. Berlioz's "The Damnation of Faust" was also first performed there on 6 December 1846. That first performance was a disaster.
The building in which the Op√©ra-Comique performs is called the "salle Favart,". It is not the same building as in 1714. Two previous buildings were burnt down in 1838 and 1887. The present building was built in 1898.

Walter Scott

Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet, FRSE (15 August 1771 ‚Äì 21 September 1832) was a Scottish historical novelist, playwright, and poet, widely popular in the first half of the 19th century.
Scott was the first English-language author to have a truly international career in his lifetime. As adventures, "Ivanhoe", and "Rob Roy" are very well-known, and both were made into films. "Waverley" is important because it is the first historical novel. It was, for most readers, their first encounter with Highland culture. Scott wove together history and fiction. What he started with "Waverley", he continued with his other novels.
Scott's output was huge. Though many of his works are little read now, they sold well in their day, and paid for his great house, Abbotsford. Of his poetry "The Lady of the Lake" is best liked. 
Scott was also an advocate, judge and legal administrator by profession. Throughout his career he combined his writing and editing work with his daily occupation as Clerk of Session and Sheriff-Depute of Selkirkshire.
A prominent member of the Tory establishment in Edinburgh, Scott was an active member of the Highland Society and served a long term as President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1820‚Äì32).
Scott was educated at Edinburgh High and the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 1783. After spending some time in his father's office he became a barrister in 1792. In 1797 he married Charlotte Charpentier and in 1799 was appointed deputy Sheriff of Selkirkshire. He now began to write books in earnest.
In 1821 he was made a baronet. His house is now a public museum visited by many tourists each year.
In 1825 and 1826, a banking crisis swept through the cities of London and Edinburgh. The Ballantyne printing business, in which he was heavily invested, crashed. Scott was ruined. He placed his house and income in a trust belonging to his creditors, and set out to write his way out of debt. 
He kept up his huge output of fiction, as well as producing a biography of Napoleon Bonaparte. By 1831 his health was failing. Still, he did a grand tour of Europe, where he was welcomed wherever he went. He returned to Scotland and, in September 1832, died at Abbotsford, near Melrose in the Scottish Borders. Though he died owing money, his novels continued to sell well. The debts of his estate were eventually discharged.

British Rail Class 13

The British Rail Class 13 was formed in 1965. The Tinsley Marshalling Yard needed more powerful shunters to move vehicles around. This was provided by permanently coupling together two Class 08 shunters as a ‚Äòmaster and slave‚Äô (or ‚Äòcow and calf‚Äô) unit. The second of the two units had its cab taken off. Both units were ballasted to improve traction. At first the units were coupled cab-to-cab but it was easier to couple Master nose to Slave cab. The thinking behind adopting this dual locomotive design is that a larger, rigid locomotive could not be used due to the risk of grounding on the hump.

The locomotives were originally numbered D8000‚ÄìD8199 and D8300‚ÄìD8327. They are known by railway enthusiasts as "Choppers", a name taken from the distinctive beat the engine produces under load which resembles the sound of a helicopter.

Pawn (chess)

The pawn (‚ôô‚ôü) is the weakest piece in the game of chess. They represent foot soldiers. Each player starts the game with eight pawns, one on each square of the second row (or rank) from the view of the player. In the white pawns start on a2, b2, c2, ..., h2, while the black pawns start on a7, b7, c7, ..., h7.
Pawns move differently than other pieces. Unlike all the other pieces, pawns can not move backwards. Most of the time, a pawn moves by going up a single square, but the first time each pawn is moved from its starting place, it can go forward two squares. Pawns may not use the first two-square move to jump over a square with another piece on it or to capture. Any piece in front of a pawn, white or black, stops its moving. 
The white pawn at e4 can capture either the black rook at d5 or the black knight at f5, but not the bishop at e5, which blocks its straight way forward. Unlike other pieces, the pawn does not capture in the same way as it moves. A pawn captures diagonally, one square forward and to the left or right. In the diagram to the left, the white pawn can capture either the black rook or the black knight.
An even more unusual move is the "en passant" capture.
En passant happens when a pawn uses its first-move option to move two squares forward instead of one. If it passes over a square guarded by an enemy pawn, that pawn can take the first pawn "in passing" "as if" the first pawn had moved forward only one square. The taking pawn moves into the empty square over which the first pawn moved. The first pawn is removed from the board.
To capture "en passant" can only be done on the move right after the double-square pawn advance. Otherwise the chance is lost.
The "en passant" move was added in late fifteenth century Europe, to make up for the then newly added two-square first move rule. We have no record of why the rule was added, but it is easy to see that it works to prevent the position becoming blocked and uninteresting.
The simplest piece in chess, the pawn was in the oldest version of chess, Chaturanga. It is present in all other types of chess around the world.
The changes which took place in the fifteenth century were aimed at allowing the pieces to develop faster, and make the game more exciting.

British Rail Class 28

The British Rail Class 28 (Metropolitan-Vickers Type 2) diesel locomotives, or 'Metrovicks' as they were popularly known, were built as part of the British Railways Modernisation plan. The locomotives had a Co-Bo wheel arrangement (a 6-wheel bogie at one end, a 4-wheel bogie at the other) ‚Äì unique in British Railways practice though not uncommon in other countries, notably Japan. This affected their route availability, due to the different axle loading at each end of the loco, and made maintenance more complicated. The maximum tractive effort of 50,000¬†lbf was unusually high for a Type 2 locomotive but, as there were five (not four) driving axles, the risk of wheelslip was minimal.

The British Rail Class 29 consisted of 20 diesel locomotives which were rebuilt from the North British Class 21. The original license-built MAN engines of the Class 21s had proved unreliable, so in 1963 locomotive D6123 was sent to Paxman's Colchester works to receive a new Paxman Ventura V12 engine. A further 19 were re-engined in 1964-1965 at Polmadie Works, with other changes made at the same time. This included the fitting of four-character headcode displays in the nose ends. After rebuilding, they returned to service from Eastfield depot in Glasgow.
Although these offered more power and much improved reliability over the original Class 21s, they did not survive much longer, due to their small class size and the use of a non-standard high-speed diesel engine. D6108 was withdrawn in May 1969 and scrapped by McWilliams of Shettleston in 1971, while the other 19 were withdrawn between April and December 1971 and scrapped at BR's Glasgow Works in 1971-72.

Chess piece

In the board game chess, each player starts with 16 Chess pieces. The moves of the pieces are defined by tradition, and by the international chess federation, FIDE. 
The bottom-right square of the board for each player must be white. Remember, "White is right". 
Pawn - A pawn can only move ahead, to the far end of the board. A pawn is placed in each square on the second row away from each player at the beginning of a game, right in front of all of their other pieces, so each player begins with eight pawns. Most times, a pawn can only move to one square, the square in front of it. But a pawn that has not moved yet in the game can move ahead two squares, or just one. 
If an enemy piece is straight in front of a pawn, the pawn cannot capture that piece. Pawns have a special way to capture. A pawn can capture an enemy piece which is on the diagonal square to the left or right of the square in front of it. This is the only time a pawn can move to a square that is not straight in front of it.
If a pawn reaches the end of the board, it is removed and replaced by any other piece the player chooses, except a king or pawn.
If a pawn moves two squares on its first move, it may be taken (on the opponent's next move only) by an enemy pawn as if it had moved only one. This is called "en passant" (French for "in passing"). A pawn is worth 1 point.
Bishop - A bishop can move any number of squares "diagonally", meaning, if you pretend the bishop is in the middle of a big X, it can move to any square along the lines of the X. Because of this, a bishop will be on the same color of squares for the whole game. At the start, a bishop is placed on the third from the left and third from the right of the row of pieces closest to each player. A bishop is worth 3 points.
Knight - The knight is special because it is the only piece than can jump over other pieces. When a knight moves, first it goes two squares in one of the four ways a rook can move. Then the knight ends its move by going one square to the side. The knight is said to move in the shape of an L. See the picture "(picture is coming)". It "jumps over" the pieces on its way to its new square, and does not capture them, but the knight will capture an enemy piece if it lands on one. Knights are placed at the second and seventh squares on the rows closest to each player, between the rooks and the bishops. A knight is worth 3 points.
Rook - A rook can move any number of squares: left or right on the ranks, and up & down on the files. Rooks start at the far left and far right squares in the row closest to each player, next to the knights. A rook is worth 5 points.
Queen - The queen combines the moves of a bishop and a rook. The queen is placed next to the king "on a square of its own colour". Thus the two queens exactly face each other at the start. The queen is worth 9 points.
King - The king starts next to the queen. The king can move to one of the eight squares around it. It is limited as an active piece, but always is vulnerable to attack. No numerical value can be put on it.
A king may perform a special move known as "castling". This is when a king moves two spaces towards a rook, and the rook moves to the square on the other side of the king. This may not be done if:

The British Rail Class 35 is a class of mixed traffic B-B diesel locomotive with hydraulic transmission. On account of their Mekydro-design hydraulic transmission units, the design became known as the Hymeks.
The type was developed for the Western Region of British Railways, which had opted for lightweight locomotives with hydraulic transmission when allocated funds under the British Railways Modernisation Plan of 1955. One hundred and one of the class were built between 1961 and 1964 when it became apparent that there was a requirement for a medium power diesel-hydraulic design for both secondary passenger work and freight duties.
They were allocated to Bristol Bath Road, Cardiff Canton and Old Oak Common. None of the class was named. Withdrawal from service began in 1971, and by 1975 all had been withdrawn. Their early withdrawal was caused, primarily, by BR classifying the hydraulic transmission as non-standard. Four examples survived into preservation.

British Railways' (BR) Type 4 "Warship" class diesel-hydraulic locomotives were introduced in 1958. It was apparent at that time that the largest centre of expertise on diesel-hydraulic locomotives was in Germany. The Western Region of British Railways (in view of post-World War II sensibilities) negotiated a licence with German manufacturers to scale down the German Federal Railway's "V200" design to suit the smaller loading gauge of the British network, and to allow British manufacturers to construct the new design. The resultant design bears a close resemblance both cosmetically and in the engineering employed. They were divided into two batches: examples built at BR's Swindon works were numbered in the series D800 to D832 and from D866 to D870, had a maximum tractive effort of 52,400 pounds force and are the British Rail Class 42 of this article. 33 others, D833-865, were constructed by the North British Locomotive Company and became British Rail Class 43.

Rook (chess)

A rook (from Persian ÿ±ÿÆ "rokh") is a piece in the board game of chess. Its name derives from its name in the old IndoArabic game (see History of chess). Each player starts the game with two rooks. When recording games, it is shortened to R, and when printed a figurine is used.
In chess notation, the white rooks start on the "a1" and "h1" squares, and the black rooks start on the "a8" and "h8" squares. 
The rook moves forward or back on the files through any number of squares without other pieces on them, and sideways on the ranks. This is shown in the diagram below. Like other pieces, it captures by going into the square on which an enemy piece stands. 
The rook and king also take part in a special move called castling.

Angels &amp; Airwaves

Angels and Airwaves (AvA) is an American alternative rock band. It was formed by former Blink-182 singer and guitarist, Thomas DeLonge. The memers of the band were Atom Willard, former Offspring drummer; Matt Wachter, former bassist of 30 Seconds to Mars; and David Kennedy, former guitarist of Hazen Street and Boxcar Racer. 
DeLonge created the band angels and airwaves to bring good music to people ears. The band performed amazing live performances and was well liked by Delonge's fans. Most of the songs have long built up intros with guitars, synthesizer, drums and keyboards. Delonge showed over time that his live voice had improved since his time singing for Blink 182. 
Angels and Airwaves released their first album, "We Don't Need To Whisper" in 2005. The second studio album, "I-Empire" was released in October 2007. It was a more lighthearted album with a faster beat. AvA has toured very much. They have said that they will be playing for the second year in a row at Vans Warped tour. They will be playing the entire tour. 
DeLonge has covered a few songs from Blink 182 but he has never played the full song in respect to his former band mates. He has played slowed versions of "Down", "I Miss You", "Not Now", and "Reckless Abandon". He only plays these songs by himself with his guitar.

Martha Jones (Doctor Who)

Dr. Martha Jones is a fictional character who is played by Freema Agyeman in the television series "Doctor Who" and its spin-off series, "Torchwood". She is a companion of the Tenth Doctor in "Doctor Who", replacing Rose Tyler in the role of the main companion. She made her first appearance in Series 3's "Smith and Jones", broadcast in the UK on 31 March 2007.
Martha Jones is introduced in the 2007 series of "Doctor Who", first appearing in the episode "Smith and Jones". When the hospital she works at is moved to the Moon, Martha helps save the day alongside an alien time traveller known only as the Doctor (David Tennant). To thank her for her help, the Doctor invites her to join him for one trip in his time machine the TARDIS, but he later accepts her as his full-time "companion", admitting that she was "never just a passenger", and he even gives her the key to the TARDIS. Nevertheless, she becomes frustrated because the Doctor does not realise her feelings for him, When the Doctor falls in love(while believing himself to be a human) in the "Human Nature"/"The Family of Blood" two-parter, a pained Martha claims "You had to go and fall in love with a human... and it wasn't me". In the last episode of the series she spends a year travelling the world in a plan which saves the Doctor and reverses time, undoing the Master's actions.
The character reappears in the 2008 series of the "Doctor Who" spin-off "Torchwood", which focuses on occasional "Doctor Who" companion Jack Harkness. She first appeared in the episode "Reset" as part of a three-episode story, 
Later in the Fourth Series of Doctor Who, Martha returns for a three-episode arc beginning with "The Sontaran Stratagem" and ending with "The Doctor's Daughter", Agyeman appears in the role again for the final two episodes of the series, "The Stolen Earth"/"Journey's End",where she has been promoted to a US division of UNIT.
Aside from television appearances, the character of Martha also appears in "Doctor Who" novels and comic books, some of which it is unknown if they are canon or not.
In books, Martha appears in the "New Series Adventures" series of "Doctor Who" novels, published by BBC Books. The first book published was a "Quick Reads" novel, "Made of Steel" by Terrance Dicks (published before her first television appearance), and the character subsequently appeared in all novels in the series, starting with "Sting of the Zygons" by Stephen Cole and most recently in "The Many Hands" by Dale Smith. Freema Aygeman appears as the character on the cover of every novel. In late 2008 "The Story of Martha", a collection of stories focusing on Martha's adventures between "The Sound of Drums" and "Last of the Time Lords", will be published.
In comic strip apperences,Martha has appeared in the "Doctor Who Magazine" strips from #381 onwards and the "Doctor Who Adventures" comics from #28 onwards. The character also appears in the "Battles in Time" series of comic books periodically. In 2007, American comic book publisher IDW Publishing announced their plans to do a series of Tenth Doctor and Martha comics for a America. When asked about canonicity, IDW executive editor Chris Ryall dodged the issue by saying all the comics are "blessed" by Russell T Davies but it is up to the individual how canonical each story is.
Martha also appears in a Radio 4 "Torchwood" drama, "Lost Souls" which aired in Summer 2008.

Louis Antoine Jullien

Louis Antoine Jullien (born Sisteron, France, 23 April, 1812; died Paris, 14 March 1860) was a French conductor who was famous for his showmanship.
Jullien was born in Sisteron, in the French Alps. At his baptism he had 36 godfathers and was given 36 Christian names. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire. He was a good musician, but mostly he enjoyed popular dance music. He conducted a band, but had to leave Paris because he owed people a lot of money.
He went to London where he formed a good orchestra. His orchestra played at a series of summer concerts (called "Concerts d‚Äô√©t√©"). Later he conducted a series of winter concerts ("Concerts d‚Äôhiver"). Although he was a good conductor he was a great showman. He would make a big show of putting on his white gloves which were given to him on a silver plate. He used a special baton (conductor‚Äôs stick) which had jewels in it when he conducted Beethoven. He wore a white waistcoat and enormous wrist bands, and he had a huge moustache and long, black hair. He would throw himself around when conducting and finish by sinking into a velvet chair. The audience loved it, especially when he added military bands to his orchestra. He used to conduct facing the audience. He conducted concerts in the London theatres and parks (promenade concerts). 
Jullien‚Äôs programmes included works by the great composers, e.g. Beethoven and Mozart, but they were always mixed with light music: dances, quadrilles, marches, etc. He often added lots of extra instruments to the great classics, e.g. when he conducted Beethoven‚Äôs Fifth Symphony he added four ophicleides, a saxophone and side drums. 
Jullien travelled to Scotland, Ireland and America with his orchestra. In 1852 he produced an opera, "Pietro il grande", at Covent Garden, but it cost a ridiculous amount of money and he was financially ruined. 
Eventually he went back to France where he was arrested and put in prison because of his debts. He died in a lunatic asylum. His wife, to whom he had been happily married, lived on for many years, and their son Louis became a conductor and tried to conduct promenade concerts, but he did not have much success.
Jullien‚Äôs behaviour might seem strange to us today, but he lived at a time when the role of the conductor was becoming very important as orchestras had become much larger than they had been in the 18th century. He gave people who had never heard good classical music the chance to hear the music by the great composers. He had a very big influence on the musical scene in London and people talked about him for many years after his death.

British Rail Class 71

The British Rail Class 71 was an electric locomotive used on the Southern Region of British Railways. Unlike most other Southern Region electric locomotives (such as the class 73s & 74s) they could not operate away from the electrified (750 V DC third rail) system.

British Rail Class 73

The British Rail Class 73 electro-diesel locomotives are very unusual in that they can operate from a 750 V DC third-rail supply but also have a diesel engine to allow them to operate on non-electrified routes. This makes them very versatile, although the diesel engine produces less power than is available from the third-rail supply so they rarely stray from the former Southern Region of British Rail. Following the withdrawal of the more powerful Class 74 electro-diesels in 1977, the Class 73 is now unique on the British rail system.

The British Rail Class 86 was the standard electric locomotive built during the 1960s, developed as a result of testing with the earlier Classes 81, 82, 83, 84 and 85. One hundred of these locomotives were built from 1965-1966 by either English Electric at Vulcan Foundry, Newton-le-Willows, or British Rail (BR) at their Doncaster works. The class was built to haul trains on the then newly electrified West Coast Main Line, from London Euston, to Birmingham, Crewe, Manchester Piccadilly, Liverpool and later Preston and Glasgow. They helped to replace steam locomotives, which were finally withdrawn by BR in 1968.

The British Rail Class 87 is a type of electric locomotive built from 1973-75 by British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL). 36 of these locomotives were built to work passenger services over the West Coast Main Line (WCML). They were the flagships of British Rail's electric locomotive fleet until the late 1980s, when the Class 90s started to come onstream. The privatisation of British Rail saw all but one of the fleet transferred to Virgin Trains; they continued their duties until the advent of the new Pendolino trains, when they were transferred to other operators or withdrawn. The last Class 87 in UK mainline use was withdrawn from service on 31 December 2007. Most have now been sold for reuse in Bulgaria.

British Rail Class 85

The British Rail Class 85 is an electric locomotive built during the early 1960s, as part of BR's policy to develop a standard electric locomotive. Five prototype classes (81-85) were built and evaluated, which eventually led to the development of the Class 86 locomotive. The locomotives of Class 85 were Originally fitted with germanium rectifiers which were eventually replaced by silicon rectifiers. Forty of these locomotives were built from 1961-64 by BR at Doncaster Works. The class were used to haul trains on the then newly electrified West Coast Main Line, from Birmingham, to Crewe, Manchester Piccadilly, Liverpool and later Preston. By 1965, electrification had spread south to London Euston.
Under the earlier BR classification, the type was given the designation AL5 (meaning the 5th design of 25 kV AC Locomotive), and locomotives were numbered E3056-E3095. In 1968, this was changed to Class 85, when BR introduced a new computer numbering system. From 1971 onwards, locomotives were progressively renumbered into the 85001-040 series. Fifteen locomotives were converted for freight only use, numbered in the 85/1 series. These locomotives were restricted to 80¬†mph.

Only one unit was built, no. 89001, which was officially named "Avocet" by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on January 16 1989 at Sandy, Bedfordshire - the home of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (whose logo is an avocet). It was built in 1986, by BREL at their Crewe Works, and was used on test-trains on both the West Coast Main Line and East Coast Main Line. It was fitted with advanced power control systems and develops over 6,000 bhp (4,500 kW). It was given the nickname "Aardvark" although the railfans used to call it "The Badger" owing to its sloping front ends.

Class 93 is the traction classification assigned to the electric locomotives that were to enter service as part of British Rail's "InterCity 250" project on the West Coast Main Line. They would have been derived from the Class 91 locomotives that entered service on the East Coast Main Line in 1989. The locomotive would have been utilised along with a train of up to nine Mark 5 coaches and a DVT, similar to the "InterCity 225" sets. The locomotives would have been capable of up to 155 mph. Tenders to construct the locomotives and rolling stock were issued in March 1991, with an expected in service date of 1995; it was envisaged that up to 30 complete trains would be initially required, with a total cost estimated at ¬£380 million. However, the cancellation of the InterCity 250 project in 1992 meant that the rolling stock orders were never made. Here is a picture of what the cab may have looked like.

Hello all, I thought I would not bore you with tales of my Chrismas adventure, instead, I have written a poem, based on "The Night before Christmas" by Clement Clarke Moore.
"All names are simply here to make the poem make sense, nothing personal."
I hope you enjoy it! 20:48, 24 December 2008 (UTC)
Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the wiki,
No-one was editing, not even -ky.
The were updated with care,
In hope that some newbies would see them there.
The editors were all nestled all snug in their beds,
With visions of vandals advertising their meds.
And in his ‚Äòkerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter‚Äôs nap
When out on the wiki there was such a smash,
Jimbo spilled his wine and the servers did crash.
Away to my watchlist I clicked with speed,
Alas no good, re-write the wiki, we need.
I sat with frustration, writing some text,
Creating a stub before moving to the next.
As I invented some elements for the table,
Some user did add a QD label.
Ignoring good faith to his talk page I swore,
As he laughed at my new, fantasy, ore.
While I begged him for his helping hand,
I wrote about my favourite MySpace band.
My horror subsided as more content appeared,
The dog got a fright as I punched and cheered.
I‚Äôm glad its fixed as I look for my pup,
We never knew that Santa has a backup
As he left the servers, the jolly old man,
His next stop was to a kid in Japan
But I heard him exclaim, ‚Äòere he drove out of sight,
"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!"

Georg Michaelis

Georg Michaelis (8 September 1857 ‚Äì 24 July 24 1936) became the first Chancellor of Germany with a non-noble background.
Michaelis was born at Haynau in Silesia. He studied law in Breslau, Leipzig and Wurzburg. He graduated from G√∂ttingen University in 1884.
He was invited by the Japanese government to teach at the German school of law in Tokyo from 1885 to 1889.
When he returned to Germany, he joined the civil service. The Emperor appointed him Reich Chancellor ("Reichskanzler") from July to November 1917.

1994 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1994 Atlantic hurricane season was the time from June 1 to November 30, 1994 when hurricanes officially formed in the Atlantic Ocean. Storms sometimes form before and after these dates but most storms form during the season. However, in this season no Tropical Cyclone formed after November 30, the end of the season because the last storm, Hurricane Gorden died on November 21, just nine days before the 30th.
The season was unusual in that it produced no major hurricanes, which are those of Category 3 status or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The strongest, Hurricane Florence, it's top winds were at a Category 2 storm with winds of 110¬†mph (175¬†km/h). Aside from Chris, Florence, and Gordon, none of the storms became hurricanes. A famous hurricane from 1994 would probably be Hurricane Gordon. Hurricane Gordon was a strange long lived November hurricane that killed at least 1,100 people in Haiti.
Alberto formed from a north-moving tropical depression north of the Yucat√°n Peninsula on July 2. Tropical Storm Alberto continued north, making landfall near Destin, Florida on July 3 as a moderately strong tropical storm. The storm weakened quickly to a tropical depression, which then moved around Georgia and Alabama until it dissipated on July 7. Damage was guessed at $500¬†million (1994¬†USD) and 30 deaths were caused by the effects of Tropical Storm Alberto.
Tropical Depression Two formed near South Carolina on the 19th. The depression moved north making landfall in South Carolina and dissipated on July 23rd. No damage or deaths reported.
Beryl formed off the Florida Panhandle on August 15, only twelve hours before it made landfall near Panama City, Florida. Beryl quickly strengthened before landfall and reached its top winds of 60¬†mph. Beryl caused inland flooding as it moved through Georgia, across the Carolinas, and all the way to Connecticut where it was absorbed by a frontal system. Damage was guessed at $73¬†million (1994 USD). Though it caused no deaths, a lot of people were injured by the 37 tornadoes Beryl produced as it weakened.
Chris formed midway between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde on August 17, and reached hurricane strength the next day. It moved to the northwest and turned north and brushed Bermuda as a weak tropical storm on the 21st. Chris continued north, and dissipated without causing any damage
The wave that would become Tropical Depression Five was tracked beginning on August 17. The wave was upgraded into a depression on August 29 near the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Tropical Depression Five made landfall in Tampico on the 31st and dissipating the same day over Mexico. No damage was caused by Tropica Depression Five.
Tropical Storm Debby formed on September 10, just east of the lesser antilies. The storm crossed some of the islands, and dissipated south of Puerto Rico on the 11th. Nine people dead because of Tropical Storm Debby. Damage estimates are not available. It cause flooding and mudslides in Saint Lucia.
Ernesto formed southwest of Cape Verde on September 22 it became Tropical Storm Ernesto. It moved north for two days, and by the 24th had weakened to a tropical depression. Two days later Ernesto dissipated without affecting any land.
Tropical Depression Eight formed on September 19 in the southwestern Caribbean Sea. The wave strengthened into Tropical Depression Eight on September 24 near Honduras. Tropical Depression Eight made landfall in Mexico and dissipated the next day over Guatemala. Some reports show that the remnants of Eight became Tropical Depression Ten.
Tropical Depression Nine form off the coast of Africa on September 26. It was upgraded to the ninth depression of the 1994 season, 150 miles southeast from the Cape Verde Islands the next day. The depression moved north and dissipated on September 29.
An area of disturbed weather, related to Tropical Depression Eight, moved across the northwest Caribbean Sea and the Yucat√°n Peninsula. A tropical wave moved into the area, causing an increase in showers and cloudiness. The wave became Tropical Depression Ten on September 29 about 150 miles off the coast of Cuba. The system became better-organized and when the depression moved into the Gulf of Mexico, it was absorbed by a non-tropical system on 30th. Tropical Depression Ten caused $5¬†million in damage (1994¬†USD).
Florence, at first formed as a subtropical depression in the central Atlantic on November 2. As it northwest, it took on tropical characteristics and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Florence on the 4th. It reached hurricane strength, then turned to the northeast and on November 6, as it was picked up by a strong trough. Two days later Florence was absorbed by the same trough that made it turn northeast. There was no reported damage.
Hurricane Gordon was a very deadly and damaging tropical storm for the Caribbean, Florida and parts of North Carolina. The storm was very slow moving on its path over the Caribbean. This storm killed over 1100 people (estimates range between 500-2300 people dead through Haiti and the central Caribbean islands, including Jamaica and Cuba). The storm's strange motion was making Hurricane Gordon hard to forecast where it would actually go and where it would reach land. Damage was guessed to be at $400¬†million (1994 US dollars). 
Around Christmas in 1994 a nor'easter may have had tropical characteristics, though it was not called a tropical system. It affected the Mid-Atlantic and New England causing damage at $21 million.
In 1994, only 7 out of 21 names were used. The following names were supposed to be used: 
No names retired as a result all name would be used again in 2000

British Rail Class 101

The British Rail Class 101 diesel multiple units were built by Metro-Cammell at Washwood Heath in Birmingham from 1956 to 1959, following construction of a series of prototype units. This class proved to be the most successful and longest-lived of all BR's "First Generation" DMUs, with the final five units being withdrawn on 24 December 2003. The oldest set was, by then, just over 47 years old.

British Rail Class 103

The British Rail Class 103 diesel multiple units were built by Park Royal Vehicles with diesel engines by British United Traction (BUT). Ordered in the first half of 1955, 20 of these sets were built by Park Royal at the Crossley Motors works in Stockport of the ACV Group. They consisted of a power car and a driving trailer. Standard BUT equipment was fitted, with 'A' type engines.
A two-car set with 16 first class and 100 second class seats weighed just under 60 long tons, representing 1,150 lb (520 kg) a seat and had 5 hp per ton of empty weight or 4.35 hp per ton when full.

British Rail Class 104

The British Rail Class 104 diesel multiple units were built by Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company from 1957 to 1959.
The first units ordered were for the London Midland Region, with the majority of the class for use in North West of England with sets also in Tyneside (being made redundant by the opening of the Tyne & Wear Metro in 1980). In the mid-1980s a few units reallocated to Scotland, with one unit being repainted in a unique maroon and white livery for services to Oban - it became known as the "Mexican Bean". Other vehicles spent time in London and the last vehicles could be found there in the early 1990s.
The class was gradually taken of service from the early 1980s. The final vehicles were withdrawn in 1995.

The Class 111 DMUs were based on Class 101/2s, but with different engines. The only external body difference was on the final batch of cars where a four character headcode box was fitted above the front cab windows, with the destination indicator on top of a reduced height centre window.
The first cars built, part of an order for 339 Met-Camm cars, were 4 power/trailer sets for the LMR Manchester area built in early 1957. One of these had supercharged 230 hp 6-cylinder engines. This was followed by ten 3-car sets comprising DMBS/TS/DMC for the NER at Bradford, then a further twenty 3-car sets.

British Rail Class 112

The Class 112 DMUs used the standard Cravens body used for Class 105s but had a single Rolls-Royce engine of 238¬†hp per car, and they were all formed into 'power twins'- two car sets with both vehicles powered.
There were two batches built, the first 50 vehicles (25 sets) had standard mechanical transmission via a gearbox and were allocated the Class 112. The second batch of 50 cars (25 sets) had hydraulic transmission, and became Class 113s.
The cars were built for services in the LMR Central Division and in the Liverpool - St Helens area, where the gradients in the Lancashire & Yorkshire area required more power. Both types also spent some time working from Cricklewood.
The gross weight of a set with all seats occupied was approximately 70 tons, giving 6.8 hp per ton. Empty, it was 8.1 hp/ton, which compared favourably with 5.7 hp/ton that the Cravens power/trailer had.

This coming year, I hope for the community to achieve a better standard of simple language. The simple language on this site really must be improved. Many of our articles are not simple at all, and I am not very good at simplification. Simplification of text can be quite difficult, as there are many concepts that can not easily be explained in simple language without having the appearance of talking down to the reader, or using a description that does not have the full effect of the concept. This should be something that the community should focus more on, as it is a problem that may lead to the project not meeting its goals, becoming a Mini English Wikipedia, and/or being shut down. Of course, the shutdown would be justified and necessary if the project does not meet its goals.
We should also focus on the expansion of articles, as a very large amount of our articles are stubs. For example, a tenth of the articles here are under 534 bytes. It seems that the creation of articles is considered higher in the priority scale than article expansion. This is a somewhat neglected task, so before we have 100,000 stubs, we should have longer, more informative articles. I hope to have at least 75 good or very good (featured) articles by the end of 2009.
Also, governance should be improved upon. I don't really care about how many bureaucrats we have, but by the end of '09, we as a community should have public logs of IRC. For the time that I have been on IRC, many administrative actions have been discussed. The issue with StaticFalcon (now known as User:FastReverter) was discussed heavily on IRC, with people even launching an attack on Static when he was absent. The logs are now deleted, but can be viewed by administrators at . This type of inappropriate behavior exhibited by users such as SwirlBoy39 (who also launched two "prank" attacks on me, and in my opinion needs to be banned for immaturity and bad conduct) needs to be documented, in addition to co√∂peration between a group of editors to push their point of view. Simple IRC Channels, despite what many say, are used as a venue for things other than informal socializing. Administrative training, like when some users (I forgot whom) advised Kennedy as to how to do a deletion, is done on IRC, and though not bad in itself, should be documented in cases of misconduct by the trainer, such as conspiring on private chat. It should no longer be private.
Another governance measure should be to ensure that IP addresses should be shown in the histories of BLPs so that editors who repeatedly vandalize or deliberately add untrue information can be identified to their ISPs. Also, we should be much more flexible towards editors who happen to be different from us in a certain way, such as not being able to speak English fully, not being used to Wikipedia, etc. Specific cases of inflexibliity are those of User:Berserkerus and . Administrators should acknowledge their role as servants of the community, and should only act as enforcer of the community's will. 
We should listen to critics of the model more, not ban them.
Finally, I wish people could spell the word "bureaucrat" around here properly.

1995 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1995 Atlantic hurricane season was the time from June 1 to November 30, 1995 when hurricanes officially formed in the Atlantic Ocean. Storms sometimes form before and after these dates but most storms form during the season. No storms formed after November 30 in the 1995 season.
The 1995 season was extremely active, largely due to favorable conditions including a La Ni√±a and warm sea surface temperatures. Nineteen named storms formed during the season, making it the third most active on record behind the 2005 and 1933 seasons and tied with 1887 season. There were also eleven storms that reached hurricane strength, again the third most hurricanes in one season after the 1969 and 2005 seasons.
This season broke the record for the most Tropical Cyclones at a time in the Atlantic with five storm at a time from August 22 to September 1 ‚Äì Humberto, Iris, Jerry, Karen, and Luis, were the names of the storms at the same time. 
On August 4, Tropical Depression Six formed in the Bay of Campeche. Six made landfall in over Mexico and dissipated on August 6, never reaching tropical storm strength. There were no reports of damage or deaths. 
Tropical Storm Gabrielle formed on August 9 and nearly became a hurricane but it made landfall in Mexico, near La Pesca, Tamaulipas, on August 11. Tropical Storm Gabrielle dissipated the next day without ever reaching hurricane status causing no damage or deaths.
Tropical Storm Jerry formed just off the Florida coast near Andros Island on August 23 as Tropical Depression Eleven. Jerry made landfall at as a very weak tropical storm. Jerry made landfall in Jupiter, Florida. Jerry dissipated on the 28th over Georgia. 
Hurricane Luis was one of the most powerful storms of the very active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. Hurricane Luis was the strongest storm to hit the Leeward Islands since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Luis was one of the four tropical cyclones active from August 22 to September 1 along with Humberto, Iris, Jerry, and Karen.
Tropical Depression Fourteen started on September 9. Fourteen moved mostly to the northwest, which made it further from land. It never became a tropical storm before it died on September 13.
Opal started on September 27, just to the east of the Yucatan Peninsula. It soon made landfall before becoming a tropical storm. As soon as it enter the Gulf of Mexico it became a tropical storm. It soon became a hurricane and strengthened fast. Hurricane Opal was stopped at a category 4 hurricane. When it made landfall in Florida on October 3, it was a category 2 hurricane. 
Tropical Storm Sebastien formed on August 20 from a tropical wave just east of the Lesser Antilles. Sebastien remained rather weak, moving northwest through light wind shear. Sebastien took a sharp turn and started moving south-southwest. On October 24, Sebastien weakened to a depression and made landfall in Anguilla. By this time, Sebastien had entered a low level flow as well as increasing wind shear. On October 25 Sebastien dissipated over the northern Caribbean Sea. Although its remnants still caused heavy rain over Hispaniola and Puerto Rico.
The 1995 season ended with Hurricane Tanya, the first storm to be get a name beginning with 'T' since hurricane naming began in the Atlantic basin in 1950 it was the only until Tropical Storm Tammy in 2005. 
This list is the names set aside for use in for Atlantic tropical cyclones in 1995. Notice that only Van and Wendy aren't used they are marked in .
In the Spring of 1996 the names Luis, Marilyn, Opal, and Roxanne were retired. Lorenzo, Michelle, Olga, and Rebekah were placed on the list in 2001 instead.

Red giant

A red giant is a giant star that weighs about one-half to ten times as much as our Sun. Red giants get their name because they appear to be colored red and they are very large. Many red giants could fit thousands and thousands of suns like ours inside of them. Aldebaran, Arcturus, Betelgeuse and Mira are red giants. 
Right now, our Sun is a main-sequence star, not a red giant. However, five billion years from now, scientists believe our sun will become a red giant. It will be about 200 times wider than it is now. It will become so big it will swallow up Mercury, Venus and possibly the Earth.
All new stars change hydrogen to helium through nuclear fusion. This makes a lot of energy (e.g. light and heat). In a normal star, like our Sun and all other main-sequence stars, this change happens at the very center of the star. Sooner or later, almost all of the hydrogen at the center has changed to helium. This causes the nuclear reaction to stop. The center will start to get smaller due to the star's gravity. This makes the layer just outside the center get hotter. This layer still has hydrogen. This hydrogen will fuse to make helium.
The outer layers of the star will get much, much bigger. The star will get brighter, sometimes as much as ten thousand times as bright as it was at first. Since the outside of the star will get bigger, the energy will be spread over a much larger area. Because of this, the temperature of the surface will go down and the color will change to red or orange.
Sometime later, red giants will start to fuse helium to make other elements like carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Some of their outer layers will blow away, leaving interstellar gas and dust circling the star. In time, most red giants will become white dwarfs. Very large red giants become neutron stars or black holes.

<doc id="147254" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147254" title="Hypergiant">
Hypergiant

A hypergiant (luminosity class 0) is a star with an enormous mass and luminosity, showing signs of a very high rate of mass loss. The exact definition is not yet settled.
Hypergiants are the largest stars in the universe, even larger than supergiants. The largest known hypergiant was NML Cygni, which is about 1,650 times wider than the Sun. It is one of the extreme luminous supergiant stars. The pulsating red supergiant UY Scuti is probably larger still. The hypergiant with the next largest known diameter is VY Canis Majoris, which is between 1300 and 1540 times wider than the Sun, or roughly the same diameter as the orbit of Jupiter.
Hypergiants are very rare and they have a short lifespan. While the Sun has a lifespan of around 10 billion years, hypergiants will only exist for a few million years.
Most hypergiants are red stars, but there are two special groups: luminous blue variables (LBV), and yellow hypergiants. Both of these types are very rare, with only a few examples in the Milky Way galaxy. Their rareness is probably because each type passes through its stage quite rapidly.
As luminosity of stars increases greatly with mass, the luminosity of hypergiants often lies very close to the Eddington limit. This is the luminosity at which the force of the star's gravity equals the radiation pressure outward. 
This means that the radiative flux passing through the photosphere of a hypergiant may be nearly strong enough to lift off the photosphere. Above the Eddington limit, the star would generate so much radiation that parts of its outer layers would be thrown off in massive outbursts. This would effectively restrict the star from shining at higher luminosities for longer periods.
A good candidate for hosting a continuum-driven wind is Eta Carinae, one of the most massive stars ever observed. Its mass is about 130 solar masses and its luminosity four million times that of the Sun. Eta Carinae may occasionally exceed the Eddington limit. The last time might have been outbursts observed in 1840‚Äì1860. These reached mass loss rates much higher than stellar winds would normally allow.
Another theory to explain the massive outbursts of Eta Carinae is the idea of a deeply situated hydrodynamic explosion, blasting off parts of the star‚Äôs outer layers. The idea is that the star, even at luminosities below the Eddington limit, would have insufficient heat convection in the inner layers, resulting in a density inversion potentially leading to a massive explosion. The theory has, however, not been explored very much, and it is uncertain whether this really can happen.

Yellow (song)

"Yellow" is a song by English alternative rock band Coldplay. The band wrote the song and co-produced it with British record producer Ken Nelson. It was for their first album "Parachutes". The song's lyrics are a reference to band vocalist Chris Martin's unreturned love.
The song was released across the world in June 2000. It was the second single off the album following "Shiver". It was the lead single in the United States. The single reached number four in the UK Singles Chart. This gave the band their first top-five hit in the United Kingdom.
Helped by heavy rotation and usage in promotions, the song made the band very popular. Various recording artists worldwide have since made their own versions of "Yellow". It remains one of the band's most popular songs.
"Yellow" was written in a Rockfield studio in Wales. The studio is called the Quadrangle. It is where Coldplay began working on their first album, "Parachutes". One night after finishing recording "Shiver", the lead single of the album, the band took a break and went out of the studio. Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and "just amazing", according to the song's co-producer, Ken Nelson. He told the band to look at the stars. The band looked at the stars and felt generally inspired. The song's main melody popped into the head of Chris Martin, the band's vocalist. The melody was a chord pattern. At first, Martin did not take it seriously "as he relayed the tune to the rest of the band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice". Martin has said, "The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice." The melody "started off a lot slower" according to Will Champion, the band's drummer, and sounded like a Neil Young song. Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse. When Jonny Buckland, the band's guitarist, started playing it and added to it with his own ideas, they had created the riff, "and it sort of got a bit heavier".
While composing the song's lyrics, however, Martin could not find the right words. He was thinking of a specific word to fit the song's main idea and theme. He thought that this missing word was a key word in the lyrics. He looked around the studio and found the telephone directory "Yellow Pages". Martin later titled the song "Yellow" as a reference to the directory. But according to him, "In an alternate universe, this song could be called 'Playboy.'" The lyrics progressed from there with the band collaborating. The band's bassist Guy Berryman came up with the opening line "Look at the stars". That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it.
The band and Nelson produced the track. Nelson was introduced to the band's music through the band's manager. Nelson's manager gave him a copy of an EP and single by Coldplay. Nelson wanted to work them after seeing the band perform live. "Yellow" was first recorded upstairs in the project studio. This was a demo room in Liverpool's Parr Street Studios.
Nelson and the band had some problems when they were making some parts of the song. Champion said that "...¬†it was really difficult to record, because it worked at about five or six different tempos. It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play, because sometimes it sounded too rushed, and sometimes it sounded as if it was dragging..." The band tried to get the tempo correct, according to Nelson, "because a beat either side of the tempo we picked didn't have the same groove". To improve the song, they recorded this part live and Buckland overdubbed his guitar. They recorded it two or three times until Nelson and the band were happy at the output. The band recorded backing vocals in the control room of Quadrangle.
Nelson used an analogue tape to record most of the tracks in the album. As recording progressed, "Yellow" was one of a couple of songs that they "couldn't quite get on analogue". They recorded different versions, but they did not satisfy their taste. So Nelson used Pro Tools "to get the feel of [the track] just right". Once all of the takes were recorded into the computer, "we then put it down to the 2-inch, which I found was a great way to do it", according to Nelson.
The song opens with an acoustic guitar part. This is backed by an electric guitar copying the acoustic guitar. It then forwards to the lead guitar line. It then goes back to the acoustic section. Its instrumentation is varied, including the drums, cymbals, and the occasional hi-hat and ascending bass guitar. "Yellow" features Martin's falsetto, and nearly spoken-word whispers. Martin, after the song's mixing, felt that his voice was "too subdued, too quiet".
Martin has explained that "'Yellow' refers to the mood of the band. Brightness and hope and ." The references in some of the song's lyrics, including the swimming and drawing a line, "are all metaphorical slants on the extent of his emotional devotion". The drawing of a line refers to Martin's habit of writing lists and underlining those important things on the list. Martin has commented that the song is about devotion. He refers to his unreturned love (Martin was single at the time he wrote the song). Most people have considered "Yellow" as a happy song, even though the lyrics do not seem to be.
"Yellow" and "Shiver" were first released as EPs in the spring of 2000. "Yellow" was later released as a single in UK on 26 June 2000. The single includes the songs "Help Is Round the Corner" and "No More Keeping My Feet on the Ground". The third song was taken from the band's first EP, "Safety". In the United States, however, the song was released as the lead single off the album. In October 2000, the track was sent to US college and alternative radio outlets. The band released a limited-edition CD of "Trouble", the third single off "Parachutes", which features a remix of "Yellow". It was pressed to 1,000 copies, and was issued only to fans and journalists.
The single received a massive radio airplay, particularly on BBC Radio 1. This was helped by its TV reception through its music video. The reaction was mostly positive. Even BBC Radio 2 played the track repeatedly. This heavy rotation continued for months after its release. "Yellow" eventually became 2000's most played song on the radio. The song is also regularly played at various British clubs, bars and sporting events. People often sing along when it is played. The song is often played during home games at English Championship club Watford. "Yellow" was used as the theme song for ABC fall television ads a month after the album was released in the United States. The song was also used as the theme music for The Cancer Council Australia's "Daffodil Day". This was in recognition of that organisation's official flower's yellow hue.
Critics were positive towards the song. Matt Diehl of "Rolling Stone" magazine has noted "Yellow" is "unrepentantly romantic". He added that "the band creates a hypnotic slo-mo otherworld where spirit rules supreme". "Yellow" won Best Single at the 2001 "NME" Carling Awards. It was nominated at the 2002 Grammy Awards for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. "Billboard" said that "every time that electric-guitar riff barges in, you're hooked all over again."
Brian Hiatt of "Rolling Stone" magazine has said that the song was a career-making record. Roach has claimed in his book, "Coldplay: Nobody Said It Was Easy", that although "Shiver" earned the band their first UK Top 40 single, it was "Yellow" that has changed "everything", and that it "exemplifies so much of what had made Coldplay so popular". In the US, after it was being used in promos of ABC, the band grew in popularity which continued in 2001. According to Barry Walters in his review of Coldplay's second album, "A Rush of Blood to the Head", for "Spin" magazine, the band is still known in the United States for their "surprise smash 'Yellow'". A "Billboard" magazine review said, "After one single ('Yellow') and its accompanying album ("Parachutes" ¬†... ), Coldplay have already been anointed heir to the Brit-rock throne." The song has since been regarded as the centerpiece track on the album.
Following the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, "Yellow" was the first video played on MTV once normal programming resumed.

Nepenthes

The Nepenthes, often known as "Tropical Pitcher Plants" or "Monkey Cups", are a genus of carnivorous plants in the family of the Nepenthaceae consisting of about 120 species (this number is fast increasing, with one to two new species being described each year). Many hybrids exist, both natural and created by humans. These plants come from South China, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines; westward to Madagascar and the Seychelles ; southward to Australia and New Caledonia ; and northward to India and Sri Lanka . Many are plants from hot humid lowland areas, but the majority are from high in the mountains where nights are cold. Nepenthes are often categorized as being lowland or highland varieties, depending on how high they live above sea level. Lowland varieties usually require high temperature and humidity levels. Highland varieties usually require warm days but cold and humid nights. The name "Nepenthes" was first published in 1737 in Carolus Linnaeus's "Hortus Cliffortianus".
Nepenthes traps contain a fluid of the plant's own production, which may be watery or syrupy and is used to drown prey. The trapping efficiency of this fluid remains high, even when significantly diluted by water, as inevitably happens in wet conditions. Many species of "Nepenthes" produce two different forms of pitchers. Near the base of the plant are the large lower traps, which usually sit on the ground, while the upper pitchers may be smaller, coloured differently, and have different shapes and features than the lower pitchers. 
The lower part of the trap contains glands which take nutrients from captured insects.
One of the earliest pictures of "Nepenthes" appears in Leonard Plukenet's "Almagestum Botanicum" of 1696. The plant, called "Utricaria vegetabilis zeylanensium", is without doubt a "N. distillatoria".

Kurohime (manga)

Kurohime has 14 volumes (on 2008) and is ongoing.
Magic in this world is used by Gods and by some kind of humanans, called witches (whether they are men or women). The magic used by th witches can be showed under many forms, for example can be mixed with human technology, for example a gun or a rifle. A common use of magic mixes with human technology for example is when Kurohime, shot with her gun, magic bullets, that can invoke magical beasts as dragon or a demon.
Zero - A boy saved by Kurohime in his childhood. Over ten years, he trained and became a gunslinger. He uses 4 guns and is known for his incredible speed. He does not use his guns for killing and only uses them to help people. Zero doesn't use the magic, often is used by Kurohime for to mix magic with technology. Zero loves truly Kurohime and in a part of series he will sacrifice his life for to save Kurohime.
Kurohime - A magician who fights using magical bullets. Ten years ago, she saves Zero, influencing his decision to become a gunslinger. She is very self-centered, and is said to not be able to genuinely love. As a result, she defied the gods and was cursed to walk the world as a child. She can only revert to her adult form when she falls in love. When a child, she is addressed as Himeko, and her magic powers are greatly hindered. The adult Kurohime bears a strong resemblance to the goddess that cursed her (In fact, they are both the same. Kurohime was split into 2 in her battle against the gods; one of "good" which holds all of her love and care and memories, and the other holding her "bad" side, which has no memories, except the anger and hatred. The latter is the current Kurohime, while the former is the "goddess" who gave her the curse.) She is also extremely beautiful and believes all men are her "dogs". Still, she has feelings for Zero, even if she won't admit it. Her name translates to "Black Princess" (Kuro is black and hime is princess). Her chief weapon is her witch-gun, "Senryu" (which, when translated means Tornado Dragon). Aside from being able to fire witch-bullets, Senryu can fire normal bullets with cannon-like force. In the second arc, Himeko receives the Yamato-Dachi from Yamatohime after defeating Gandhara. The sword fuses with Senryu, allowing it to switch between sword (Yamato Senryuto) and gun (Yamato Senryuho) forms.
Himeko- Kurohime's form as a child, she differs greatly from her adult self, besides the fact that she is adorable and cute while her adult self is sexy and beautiful. Himeko is hyperactive and acts like a real child, often falling asleep for naps, while as her adult form is more controlled and calm. Himeko is unable to use strong magic, for example when she tries to evoke a dragon, it comes just a funny little dragon, really useless. 
Onimaru - A heavyset gunslinger that he felt betrayed by Kurohime/Himeko. When she was bad, Kurohime used him and his troops for to build a tower for to fight Gods, after then Kurohime betrayed Onimaru. He was once her most loyal soldier and his back bears a large tattoo of the Kanji for "Dog" and "Kurohime". In the middle of series Onimaru will be cursed by a demon and will be transformed in a little lizard.
Asura - A beautiful looking woman. The people of that land call her and her kind, demons. She is extremely powerful, possessing incredible magical powers, whose destructive properties rivals a god. She is first introduced as a mysterious character who plays a subtle hand in aiding Kurohime and Zero defeat a witch.
Sword- The leader of the death angel squad (Shinigami Tenshidan) sent after Kurohime and Zero in the fourth volume. She and her comrades (Axe, Lance, Mace, Hammer, and Dagger) are sent to reap a group of vengeful souls from a ghost wagon who were revived courtesy of Kurohime. Sword seems to have a personal sense of revenge against Kurohime.
Darkray- The former God of Death. He fought Kurohime when she first challenged the gods. Using the soul of an infant murdered by an attack on Kurohime as a shield, he defeated her with Sword, slicing her in half. He was also the one who suggested splitting Kurohime into two beings: one comprised of pure hate, the other, of love and compassion. This resulted in the birth of Shirohime (White Princess)the Goddess of Mercy. He later appears in the fourth volume.
Yashahime- The mother goddess and lover of Darkray. She swears to kill Kurohime to avenge the fallen God of Death, and first appears when Kurohime killed Gandhara on Yamato. She is very powerful and she tried to kill Zero's soul.She is actually jealous of the love zero and Kurohime share, and uses Darkray's skull to turn Zero into the god of death, so as to make Kurohime experience hell on earth forever.
Yamatohime- The Phoenix Suzaku, Devil God, and Spirit Queen of Fire. She is Asura's master. She had been imprisoned by the gods in the depths of a volcano, under constant watch by the Demon God Gandhara.

These 41 high density sets operated the outer-suburban services from Marylebone usually to destinations such as High Wycombe, Aylesbury and Banbury which are on the Chiltern Main Line and Great Central Main Line (now the London to Aylesbury Line). Sometimes, these sets used to operate 8-12 car long expresses to Nottingham Victoria in the final years of the GCML. Coincidentally, the 115 were under Table 115 in the British Rail timetable.
Based on the basic Derby high density design, the sets are similar to Class 127 but were internally superior as the class had larger windows, better furnishings, lighting and wall surfaces. 
Some sets were also built for the CLC line between Liverpool and Manchester. These were later transferred to Marylebone. They also worked from Tyseley in the later years.
The Marylebone sets, which were later transferred to Bletchley but remained on Chiltern Line duties, were declared surplus after the introduction of Class 165s, from 1991 onwards. While at Bletchley depot the class was also used on the Gospel Oak to Barking Line, units being formed as power twins. They were in turn replaced on this line by class 117 power twins. 
The final Class 115 working out of Marylebone was in July 1992. The Tyseley sets survived a bit longer, until February 1994.

Borodin Quartet

The Borodin Quartet is a string quartet that was founded in 1945 in what was then the Soviet Union. The four players have not always been the same people: there have been some changes to the group, but it is one of the world's longest lasting string quartets. In 2005 they celebrated their 60th anniversary. Until he retired in 2007 the cellist Valentin Berlinsky had almost always been the cellist of the quartet.
When they started they were known as the Moscow Philharmonic Quartet. In 1955 the quartet changed its name to Borodin Quartet, named after the composer Alexander Borodin who composed two famous string quartets.
They often got invitations to play in the West, but the Soviet communist government would not allow them to travel out of their country. The quartet had to accept the concerts that their government allowed them to do. They played at the funerals of the dictator Stalin and the composer Sergei Prokofiev which were on the same day (both men died on 5 March 1953. However, they were not paid anything for either event.
The quartet knew the composer Dmitri Shostakovich very well. They performed his quartets, and Shostakovich often listened to them practising and discussed with them the way he wanted them to be played. The quartet often played piano quintets with the pianist Sviatoslav Richter.
When they started in 1945 their cellist was Mstislav Rostropovich. Rudolf Barshai was their viola player. Very soon afterwards Rostropovich found he had too many other engagements, so he got Valentin Berlinsky to be their cellist. The four men who then formed the quartet signed an oath in their own blood that they would be faithful and stay together as a group. They stayed together for 20 years. Then Rostislav Dubinsky, the first violinist, defected to the West and the second violinist, Jaroslav Alexandrov, retired because of bad health. With two new players, the quartet spend two years practising together before they performed again in public.
When Communism collapsed and the Soviet Union broke up, the quartet still continued to be very famous. They travelled abroad a lot, performing in places such as London. 
They have made many recordings including all Shostakovich's string quartets and all Beethoven quartets.

Pienza

Pienza, a town (it: "commune") in the province of Siena, in the Val d'Orcia in Tuscany (central Italy), between the towns of Montepulciano and Montalcino, is the "touchstone of Renaissance urbanism." 
In 1996, UNESCO put the town his list as a World Heritage Site, and in 2004 the all valley, the "Val d'Orcia", was put on the list of UNESCO's World Cultural Landscapes.
Pienza was rebuilt from a village called Corsignano, which was the birthplace (1405) of Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini (Italian: Enea Silvio Piccolomini), a Renaissance humanist born into an exiled Sienese family, who later became Pope Pius II. Once he became Pope, Piccolomini had the entire village rebuilt as an ideal Renaissance town. Intended as a retreat from Rome, it represents the first application of humanist urban planning concepts.The rebuilding was done by Florentine architect Bernardo Gambarelli (known as Bernardo Rossellino).
The piazza is made by four buildings. The principal residence, "Palazzo Piccolomini", is on the west side.
The "Duomo" (Cathedral), which dominates the center of the piazza, has a fa√ßade that is one of the earliest designed in the Renaissance manner. Artworks in the Duomo include five altar paintings from the Sienese School. The Baptistry, dedicated as usual to "San Giovanni".
The "Palazzo Borgia", on the third side of the piazza, was built as the palace to house the bishops who would travel to Pienza to attend the Pope. Inside the palace there is the Diocesan Museum, and the Museo della Cattedrale. The collection includes a lot of religious artifacts. Paintings include a 7th-century painting of "Christ on the Cross" ("La Croce"), 14th century works by Pietro Lorenzetti ("Madonna with Child") and Bartolo di Fredi ("Madonna della Misericordia"). There are also important works from the 14th and 15th centuries, including a Madonna attributed to Luca Signorelli.
Across from the church is the town hall. Since Corsigniano was originally a village without a town governance, before the transformations there was no town hall. But when Corsigniano was given the status of an official city, a "Palazzo Comunale" was required. A third floor was added in 1599. The "Palazzo Comunale" was probably also designed by Rossellino.

Interactive whiteboards are the modern version of the traditional whiteboards used in schools.
The interactive whiteboard must be connected to an PC before you can use the whiteboard. Most whiteboards are connected to the computer's Serial port or to a USB port. Some newer systems can use a wireless connection to the computer.
The summary of use the interactive whiteboard includes three words: controlling, translation and presentation.

For students:
Front-projection:
In this system the projector is placed in front of the whiteboard. Either the projector is fixed on the whiteboard or it hangs on the ceiling.
"Pros"
Compared to the rear projection this system is much cheaper
"Cons"
The teacher or the student must stand in front of the whiteboard and sometimes their body will cast a shadow.
Rear-projection:
In the rear-projection system the projector is placed behind the whiteboard.
"Pros"
The teacher does not cast a shadow and does not look into the projector light while speaking to the students.
"Cons"
This system is very expensive.

Sue (dinosaur)

"Sue" is the nickname given to FMNH PR 2081, the largest, most complete and best preserved "Tyrannosaurus rex" fossil ever found. 
Sue was discovered in the summer of 1990 by Sue Hendrickson, a paleontologist, and was named after her. She contacted the Black Hills Institute, whose staff retrieved and prepared the bones.
First, ownership disputes were settled in court. There was a long dispute between the owners of the land, the Sioux tribe, the United States Department of the Interior, and the Black Hills Institute, whose staff had done the work.
The fossil was then auctioned in October 1997 for US$8.36 million, the highest amount ever paid for a dinosaur fossil.
After preparation, the skeleton became a permanent feature at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois. The money had been raised by public subscription.
Some researchers think the skeleton shows evidence that Sue suffered from the painful condition known as gout.

Empoli

Empoli is a town in Tuscany, Italy, about 30¬†km southwest of Florence. It is 30 m above sea-level, to the south of the Arno. The plain of the town has been usable for agriculture since Roman times. Empoli is on the main railway line from Florence to Pisa and is well joined with the city of Siena. 
Empoli has a long tradition as an agricultural centre. It has given its name to a local kind of artichoke.
Empoli was already settled in the time of the early Roman Empire, and still existed in the 4th century AD. The river near the city was a good route for the trade of agricultural products, together with the local amphorae. 
Since the 8th century Empoli grew as a town around the castle, known as "Emporium" or "Empolis". In 1119 it was controlled by Guidi. In 1182 it went under Florentine rule. In 1260, after the Battle of Montaperti, Empoli was the seat of a famous council in which Farinata degli Uberti opposed the destruction of Florence. Later Empoli became an important fortress.
In the "frazione" of Pontorme is the house of the painter Pontormo.
Empoli's main football team is Empoli F.C., which is currently playing in Serie B.

Larderello

Larderello is a "frazione" of the "comune" of Pomarance, in Tuscany in central Italy. Larderello is famous for its geothermal productivity. 
The region was known from ancient times for its volcanic nature and for the very hot springs. The Romans used its sulphur springs for bathing. In 1827, Fran√ßois de Larderel, a Frenchman, invented a way of extracting boric acid from the volcanic mud by using steam to separate the two. The town Larderello has the name in honour of Larderel's work. The region was the site of a pioneering experiment in the production of energy from geothermal sources in 1904. Prince Piero Ginori Conti tested the first geothermal power generator on 4 July 1904, at the Larderello dry steam field in Italy. It was a small generator that lit four light bulbs. Later, in 1911, the world's first geothermal power plant was built there. In 1911, the world's first geothermal power plant was built in the Valle del Diavolo ("Devil's Valley"), named for the boiling water in the area. Larderello now produces 10% of the world's entire supply of geothermal electricity, amounting to 4,800 GWh per year.

Tramway track

Tramway tracks are used on tramways or light railways. Grooved rails (or girder rails) are normally used to let the trams run on streets. This is called "street-running". Like normal rail tracks, tram tracks consist of two parallel steel rails.
Tram rails can be placed in several surfaces. Standard rails can be put on sleepers like railway tracks, or with grooved rails on concrete sleepers into street surfaces (pavement) for street running. Another environmentally-friendly or ecologically-friendly alternative is to lay tracks into grass turf surfaces. This is known as "grassed track" (or "track in a lawn"). It was first used in Liverpool in 1924.

Light rail

Light rail or light rail transit (LRT) is a form of urban rail public transportation. Generally it can carry less people and has a lower speed than heavy rail/metro systems, but it can carry more people and has a higher speed than street-running tram systems. The term is normally used to refer to rail systems with rapid transit-style features that usually use electric rail cars operating mostly in private rights-of-way separated from other traffic but sometimes, if necessary, mixed with other traffic in city streets. Modern light rail technology is highly flexible in how it can be used, and whether any given system is considered a true rapid transit system or not depends on its implementation.

Wikipedia:Template namespace

If you have standard texts you want to include on several pages, the MediaWiki template feature comes into play.
Templates are standard wiki pages whose content is designed to be transcluded (embedded) inside other pages. Templates follow a convention that the name is prefixed with "codice_1", assigning it to that namespace. Therefore you can .
Templates are wiki pages which can be used in other pages in three ways:
In fact, an ordinary wiki page can also be used as a template, simply by qualifying the namespace it resides in, so:
If no such namespace exists, the full title is assumed to be a template:
You can define parameters in templates either numbered as codice_14 or named codice_14. 
Example: You want a little thank you note you can put on the talk page of other users. It will contain a reason and your signature. You could create to enter your text, as in the example in the table.
When using the template on a page, you fill in the parameter values, separated by a pipe char (|): codice_2. For named parameters use "name=value" pairs separated by a pipe char: codice_2. The advantage of using named parameters in your template is that they are flexible in order. It also makes the template easier to understand if you have many parameters. If you want to change the order of numbered parameters, you have to mention them explicitly: codice_2.
You can also provide default values for parameters, i.e. values that are going to be used if no value is provided for a parameter. For example, codice_14 would result in "all your hard work" if no value was provided for the parameter reason.
You can control template inclusion by the use of <code>

Then, an editor can simply copy and paste the example to create a similar page.

MediaWiki makes it very easy to link wiki pages using a standard syntax (see ). If you (or anyone else) makes a link to an article that doesn't exist yet, the link will be colored red, like this.
Clicking a red link will take you to the edit page for the new article. Simply type your text, click save and the new page will be made.
Once the page has been made, the link will change from red to blue (purple for pages you've visited) telling you that the article now exists.
Usually this is the best way to make a new page, because it means that right from the start, the page will be linked from at least one other place on the wiki (and typically you will want to mesh it into other related pages later) If you are making a new page without making any link to it, you may need to ask yourself: Does this page really fit in with the topics already covered in the wiki? Also, how are you expecting visitors to find this page? Normally there is no reason to make a page without first making a red link to it.
You can use the wiki's URL for making a new page. The URL to an article of the wiki is usually something like this:
If you replace codice_3 with the name of the page you wish to make, you will be taken to a blank page which tells you that no article of that name exists yet. Clicking the "edit" at the top of the page will take you to the edit page for that article, where you can make the new page by typing your text, and clicking submit.
If you search for a page that doesn't exist (using the search box and 'go' button on the left of the page) then you will be provided with a link to make the new page. (Note that this technique doesn't work if you use the 'search' button).
Don't forget to setup redirects when you make a page. If you think another person may search for the page you've made by using a different name or spelling, please make the proper redirect(s). See 
Normally a new wiki page can be edited by other people (that is one of the main ideas of a wiki!) However, a sysop could 'protect' the page, if wanted, to make sure normal users don't editing it.

Talyllyn Railway

The Talyllyn Railway () is a narrow-gauge preserved railway in Wales. It runs for from Tywyn on the Mid-Wales coast to Nant Gwernol near the village of Abergynolwyn. The line was opened in 1866 to carry slate from the quarries at Bryn Eglwys to Tywyn. It was the first narrow gauge railway in Britain authorised by Act of Parliament to carry passengers using steam haulage. Despite severe under-investment, the line remained open, and in 1951 it became the first railway in the world to be preserved as a heritage railway by volunteers. 
Since preservation, the railway has operated as a tourist attraction. It has increased the amount of rolling stock it has. It has done this by buying and building new locomotives and carriages. In 1976, an extension was opened along the former mineral line from Abergynolwyn to the new station at Nant Gwernol. In 2001, the preservation society celebrated its 50th anniversary. In 2005 a major rebuilding and extension of Tywyn Wharf station took place. This included a much-expanded facility for the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum.
The fictional Skarloey Railway was based on the Talyllyn Railway. This fictional railway formed part of the Railway Series of children's books by The Rev. W. Awdry. The preservation of the line inspired the Ealing Comedy film "The Titfield Thunderbolt".
The origin of the railway's name is uncertain. It could refer to the parish of Talyllyn, which contains its eastern terminus. Or it could come from Tal-y-llyn. Tal-y-llyn is a large glacial ribbon lake at the foot of Cadair Idris further east. The gauge of the track is unusual. It was shared by only three other public railways in the United Kingdom: the nearby Corris Railway (which predated the Talyllyn), and the subsequent Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway and Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway.
Slate quarrying began in the hills above Tywyn in the 1830s. Although many small quarries and test levels were established, only one major quarry was developed in the region. It was at Bryn Eglwys, north east of the town. Underground working began in the early 1840s. By 1847 the quarry was being worked by local landowner John Pughe. The finished slates were sent by packhorse to the wharf at Pennal. They were then transferred to boats for a river trip to Aberdyfi (also known as Aberdovey). Finally they were loaded into seagoing vessels. This was a complex and expensive transportation arrangement which limited the quarry's output. In 1861 the outbreak of the American Civil War cut off supplies of cotton to the mills of the north west of England. As a result a number of prosperous mill owners looked for new business opportunities to diversify their interests. One such owner was William McConnel of Lancashire. In 1859 he purchased a house near Dolgellau, north of Tywyn. In January 1864, McConnel formed the Aberdovey Slate Company. The company leased the land including Bryn Eglwys from the landowner, Lewis Morris of Machynlleth.
McConnel set about improving Bryn Eglwys to increase its output. In 1865 his company earmarked money for the construction of a narrow gauge railway connecting the quarry with the port of Aberdyfi. The standard gauge Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway was expanding rapidly from its base at Machynlleth however. In 1863 this railway had reached Tywyn, so McConnel decided to build his line from the quarry to Tywyn. This was the nearest point where slate could be transferred to the standard gauge railway. This was despite the line's initial isolation from the rest of the system because of difficulties in bridging the estuary of the Afon Dyfi to the south. An Act of Parliament (28 and 29¬†Vict, cap cccxv) allowing the company to operate passenger trains as a public railway was given Royal Assent on 5 July 186., The company appointed James Swinton Spooner as engineer for the construction. He laid out plans for a relatively straight line climbing steadily from Tywyn to the quarry and work quickly got underway. By September 1866 construction had advanced to the point where the Board of Trade inspector Captain Henry Tyler could make an initial inspection and report.
Tyler's report led to an unusual alteration. It was discovered that the loading gauge of the line was too small. The internal width of the overbridges was only , but the railway's passenger carriages were wide. This left less than clearance on either side, which was less than the minimum required clearance of . To alleviate this problem, McConnel proposed that the doors on one side of each carriage be permanently barred and the track slewed off-centre beneath the bridges. This would allow adequate clearance at least on the side with doors and mean that passengers could get out of the carriages if the train stopped underneath a bridge. Tyler agreed to this arrangement, and to this day all carriages on the Talyllyn have doors on one side only, an unusual feature for a public railway. This feature is however shared with the neighbouring Corris Railway, though for different reasons. Tyler also required that improvements be made to the railway's first two steam locomotives, as locomotive No.¬†1 suffered from excessive "vertical motion" and No.¬†2 was said to suffer from "horizontal oscillation". No.¬†1 was returned to its manufacturer where a set of trailing wheels was added to reduce the rear overhang. The springs on No.¬†2 were adjusted and the crank pins shortened to reduce its oscillation.
The railway opened with two locomotives, one was a carriage and the other carried goods. They were ran under a "one engine in steam" rule to make sure they did not crash into each other. At the beginning, locomotives were kept in a shed made of wood at Ty Dwr at the Abergynolwyn station. This was when the main engineering department of the Tayllyn was being built at . The engineering department opened up on February 17 1867.
When Talyllyn opened there were two train stations it visited, one at Pendre and the other at Abergynolwyn. In 1867, the station at opened. In 1873, and stations opened. Eventually, a line that ran from the Abergynolwyn station to the actual village of Abergynolwyn was opened. People could take an incline down a hill from the station to the town. From there, people could take a one of the many trams that ran through the village. Supplies like coal, building materials, and other things were sent down the incline from the train station to the village.
The railway used steam locomotives when it opened. The two original locomotives were made by Fletcher, Jennings & Co. of Whitehaven in Cumbria. Both of them are still used today but many of the parts inside and outside have been replaced. Talyllyn has a rare gauge. This is thought to match the gauge at Corris Railway. The locomotives at Talyllyn might be the oldest of their kind for making sure they fit that type of gauge. The locomotives, "Talyllyn" and "Dolgoch" used to carry slate from the quarry at Tywyn. It also carried other things. Trains that carried people, called passenger trains, traveled between Abergynolwyn, Dolgoch and Pendre. Men who worked on the quarries also traveled on trains, despite those trains not being able to be used by the public. Those trains traveled from Abergynolwyn to Alltwyllt and into Nant Gwernol.
The line was very successful when it opened. As of 1880, 300 people worked in the local slate industry. Over of slate was sent by train each year. Over 11,500 people first road the trains in 1867. By 1877, over 23,000 people were using the train.
Starting in the 1880s, the "Grand Tour" was popular with people visiting the area, called tourists. People could take the Talyllyn and Corris trains and go through Tal-y-llyn Lake and Cadair Idris. Then, when they returned, they could use Cambrian Railways trains. The need for slate slowed down for the last twenty years of the 1880s. Many quarries fired people or closed. Even the quarries that dug up more slate due to other quarries closing often closed eventually. This made the need for the trains less, and made the railroad companies make less money.
Eventually, the biggest quarry in the area, Bryn Eglwys closed. Most of the people who had jobs in Abergynolwyn worked at that quarry. Many people were hurt by the closure. A man who lived in Abergynolwyn, named Henry Haydn Jones bought Bryn Eglwys. He also became a MP for the Liberal representing Merioneth. The quarry, which had closed, reopened in January 1911. Haydn Jones had no money to put into the quarry. But, when workers started mining in the quarry they pulled slate from the "Broad Vein" section. That section had slate that was very hard. It was not popular and most people did not want to buy it. They stopped getting slate from the Broad Vein and started getting slate from the "Narrow Vein," which had slate that was softer and that people wanted to buy. It was very expensive to build a new mind in the Narrow Vein. So, to save money, Haydn Jones made very small entrances into the mine, which were considered unsafe by many people. The sales of slate rose during World War I because people started building new buildings after they were destroyed in the war.
After the war ended, and after 1920, people started traveling more to see the sights of Britain. The number of people who wrote on the Talyllyn rose and places that once stored slate were used to seat people, instead. Tourists could even rent slate wagons, which were used to transport slate only, as a fun thing to experience. A Gravity railway was used to move people on the wagons. People were no longer able to ride in the wagons as of the 1930s. Tourists brought more money into the area and helped the railway survive, but, Haydn Jones never made money. 
The rental contract on Bryn Eglwys ended in 1942. But, Haydn Jones could renew it each year. People were still visiting the area as tourists. In October 1942, two return trains ran on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The trip was 45 minutes long one way. They did not let people ride the trains on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. In 1946, the was a collapse in Bryn Eglwys. The quarry was called unsafe and people could not use it. It was closed. Haydn Jones kept running the railway and said he would do so until he died. In 1947, most of the railroads in Britain were bought by the government. Talyllyn remained owned by Haydn Jones. Between 1947 and 1949, people could ride the train two days a week. Haydn Jones died on July 2 1950. The railway kept running until October 6.
In 1949, Tom Rolt, who was a writer, visited the railway. David Curwen, who was a locomotive engineer, visited with him. In the summer of 1950, Rolt wrote a letter to the "Birmingham Post". He told them that it was important to rescue Talyllyn. Many people had interest in this. On October 11 1950, a meeting was held about it in Birmingham at the Imperial Hotel. About 70 people attended. Rolt told them that he thought they should make a committee, or a team, to look into buying the railway. The committee met again on October 23. They met with the people who ran Haydn Jones' finances after he had died.
It was very hard due to the law to make the committee the owners of the railway. Both the committee and Haydn Jones' people thought it was a good idea to have Jones' stop being the owner. They decided to make a new company, called Talyllyn Holdings, the owner. The company was a mix of people from the committee and from Jones' group. The company started running the railway on February 8 1951. They changed the name of the company to a non-profit called the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society. The Society started to advertise that they wanted to save the railway and asked for people to donate money. They also wanted to find people to volunteer to help run the railway. By May, almost 650 people had donated and became members of the Society. The railway re-opened on Whit Monday, on May 14 1951. Trains ran between Wharf and Rhydyronen. Starting on June 4, trains ran daily until the summer. David Curwen was the Chief Mechanical Engineer.
When the railway re-opened again it needed a lot of work done to it to fix things and update it. They bought two more steam locomotives from Corris Railway in 1951. They were named "Sir Haydn" and "Edward Thomas". In 1951, "Sir Haydn" became the first new locomotive to travel on Talyllyn Railway in over 80 years. It derailed a lot because the Talyllyn Railway was slightly wider than the Corris Railway. Eventually this was fixed by changing the width of the railway and changing parts of the locomotive wheels. The "Edward Thomas" needed a lot of service, but it was too expensive to fix. A man who was on the Preservation Society board of directors, John Alcock, had his company, the Hunslet Engine Company fix it for free.
Another locomotive was donated to the Society by an engineering company in Birmingham called Abelsons Limited. The locomotive was named "Douglas". It was built for the depot railway and was used by the RAF Calshot until 1945. It started being used by the public in 1954. Through the 1950s volunteers and Society staff members helped fix the railway tracks.
On May 22 1957, the BBC produced a live television program at the railway. Wynford Vaughan Thomas and Huw Weldon road the train from Dolgoch to Abergynolwyn. As a result of the television program, more people used the train. Over 57,000 people road the train that summer. The money that those people paid helped the Society improve the railway. In 1958, the original "Talyllyn" locomotive was put back in service.
At the Tywyn Wharf train station a museum was opened. It is called the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum. The first object that was displayed at the museum was the Guinness Brewery locomotive. It was donated to the museum in 1952. The museum opened in 1956.

Trolley pole

A trolley pole is a tapered cylindrical pole of wood or metal, used to transfer electricity from a "live" overhead wire to the control and propulsion equipment of a tram or trolley bus. The use of overhead wire in a system of current collection is reputed to be the 1880 invention of Frank J. Sprague.

Dartmouth College

Dartmouth College () is a private, coeducational university in Hanover, New Hampshire. Incorporated as "Trustees of Dartmouth College,"
it is a member of the Ivy League and one of the nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution. In addition to its undergraduate liberal arts program, Dartmouth has medical, engineering, and business schools, as well as 19 graduate programs in the arts and sciences. With a total enrollment of 5,848, Dartmouth is the smallest school in the Ivy League.
The college was established in 1769 by Congregational minister Eleazar Wheelock who wanted to use the college to Christianize the Native Americans. In 2004, Booz Allen Hamilton selected Dartmouth College as a model of institutional endurance "whose record of endurance has had implications and benefits for all American organizations, both academic and commercial," citing "Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward" and Dartmouth's successful self-reinvention in the late 1800s. Dartmouth alumni, from Daniel Webster to the many donors in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, have been famously involved in their college.
Dartmouth is on a rural 269-acre (1.1¬†km¬≤) campus in the Upper Valley region of New Hampshire. Given the College's isolated location, participation in athletics and the school's Greek system is high. Dartmouth's 34 varsity sports teams compete in the Ivy League conference of the NCAA Division I. Students are also well known for preserving a variety of strong campus traditions.
In 2010 Dartmouth College joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with University of T√ºbingen (Germany), Durham University (UK), Queen‚Äôs University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of Western Australia (Australia) and Uppsala University (Sweden).

Oldham Athletic A.F.C.

Oldham Athletic Football Club is a football that plays in Football League One. The club plays its games at Boundary Park in Oldham, England.
The club has never won any major trophies through their history, though have made several appearances in the late rounds of the FA Cup and Football League Cup.
The club was created as Pine Villa Football Club in 1895, but changed to the current name in 1899. Almost immediately, Oldham became a professional team before joining the Football League in 1907. After struggling between the First World War and the Second World War, they became more stable in 1969‚Äîwhen legendary manager Jimmy Frizzell took over. Under Frizzell, the club won 200 of their 544 competitive games and were promoted to higher levels twice.
After leaving in the summer of 1982, Joe Royle took over as the club's manager during which time Oldham again had a successful period. Under Royle, the club won 225 games of 608‚Äîa slightly higher winning percentage than under Frizzell. In the early 1990s, under Royle, Oldham reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup and the final of the Football League Cup, losing every time. However, in the 1990‚Äì91 season, the club won the Football League Second Division and were promoted to the First Division for the first time in over 70¬†years. In the 1992‚Äì93 season, Oldham was a group of 24 teams that were the founding members of the Premier League‚ÄîEngland's top division of football. After Royle's departure to Everton F.C., Oldham struggled and were relegated twice in four seasons.
In the early 2000s, Oldham Athletic almost went bankrupt. Businessman Chris Moore decided to purchase the club, promising to return to the Premier League within five years. However, later that season, he left the club, which also left behind much debt and a weak team. However, another businessman purchased the club in 2004, saving them from liquidation. In the 2006‚Äì07, under current manager John Sheridan, Oldham almost were promoted to the Football Championship, but lost in the semi-final of the play-offs.

Bagpuss

Bagpuss is a popular children's television series shown on BBC television. It was shown in 1974. Although only 13 episodes were made, it was so popular that it was repeated regularly until 1987. The series was made by Peter Firmin and Oliver Postgate through their company Smallfilms. 
The character Bagpuss was a toy cat. Bagpuss was described in each programme as "an old, saggy cloth cat, baggy, and a bit loose at the seams".
Each programme began in the same way. It started by looking through old sepia photographs. There was a shop called ‚ÄúBagpuss & Co‚Äù. The cat sat in the shop window. The owner of the shop was a little girl named Emily. The shop did not sell anything. Instead, Emily would find things that were broken and lost. She fixed them and put them in the shop window. Emily hoping that the owners of the things would come and get them. She would leave the fixed thing in front of her favourite toy: the stuffed cat Bagpuss. Each programme began with these words:
When Emily had left, Bagpuss would wake up. The programme changed from sepia to colour film, and the toys in the shop would come to life. There was Gabriel the toad, a rag doll called Madeleine, and a wooden woodpecker which was a bookend (something to stop a row of books falling over) called Professor Yaffle. Professor Yaffle spoke like a clever professor. He had a German accent and wore a pince-nez. He would look at the object and tell the audience what it was used for. There were also some mice. They lived in the ‚Äúmouse organ‚Äù (a pun on the word mouthorgan). The mouse organ played music and the mice squeaked in high voices. All the voices except those of Madeleine and Gabriel were done by Oliver Postgate who also wrote the stories.
At the end of the programme, Professor Yaffle would yawn again and fall asleep. The colour changed back to sepia and the toys became toys again as these words were spoken:

Oliver Postgate

Oliver Postgate (born Hendon, Middlesex, England, 12 April 1925 died Broadstairs, Kent, 8 December 2008) was an English animator, puppeteer and writer.
He made several series of children‚Äôs programmes for British television. They all became very popular. They include "Pingwings", "Pogles' Wood", "Noggin the Nog", "Ivor the Engine", "Clangers" and "Bagpuss". They were all made by Smallfilms, the company he set up with Peter Firmin. They were shown on the BBC between the 1950s and the 1980s, and on ITV from 1959 to the present day. In a 1999 poll, "Bagpuss" was voted the most popular children's television programme of all time.
He was born in Hendon, Middlesex, England. He went to Woodstock School and Woodhouse County Secondary School in London. When World War II started he was evacuated to Devon and he finished his studies at Dartington Hall School. He refused to fight in the war, so he was sent to prison. However, he was soon let out because he volunteered to be a stretcher bearer for the Red Cross.
In 1948 he trained as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, but he never became a professional actor. He was more interested in animation. He created the character of a pig made out of cardboard that played the violin. The BBC were not interested in his idea. Seven years later he joined the ITV London company Associated-Rediffusion as a stage manager. He worked on children‚Äôs programmes and made props. 
Postgate thought he could make better programmes than the ones he was working on, so he created "Alexander the Mouse", a story about a mouse that was born to be king. Postgate met an artist called Peter Firmin. He was good at drawing animation characters. The two men started to work together and for 30 years they created their well-known television series, running their own company called Smallfilms. The characters in their stories were moved by magnets under a table. They created "The Saga of Noggin the Nog" (1959-1965). It was based on old Norse legends. Then came "The Seal of Neptune" (1960), a story about horses that lived under the sea. They created "The Pogles" which was about a witch, but after the first broadcast it was thought to be too frightening for children. Then came "The Clangers" (1969-1974 which was their first colour production. Their most famous creation was "Bagpuss", the story of a toy cat made of rags that sat in a shop window.
In 1987 the University of Kent at Canterbury awarded an honorary degree to Postgate. Postgate said that it should really be Bagpuss who got the degree. He later showed Bagpuss wearing academic dress
Postgate married Prudence Myers in 1957, becoming stepfather to her three children The couple had twin boys in 1959 and another son in 1964. Prudence died in 1982. Naomi Linnell was his partner in the last years of his life.
He wrote an autobiography "Seeing Things" which was published in 2000. In his book he looked back at the programmes he made. He explained why they were so popular by saying: ‚ÄúThey are simple, and they are well-founded in a safe place. They are full of fun and, like a good meal, they are rich and satisfying.‚Äù
He died in Broadstairs, near his home on the Kent coast, on 8 December 2008.

An animator is an artist who makes drawings for movies. The animator makes many drawings which are called "frames". These are played very quickly, one after another, to create animation. It makes it look as if the pictures are moving. 
Animators can work in many areas including movies, television, video games, and the internet. There are many ways of making animations. Animators usually work with other people to form a team. These may be other animators, but can also include layout artists (who design the backgrounds, lighting, and camera angles), storyboard artists (who draw panels of the action from the script), background artists (who paint the "scenery"), voice actors who speak the words, and musicians who make the music.

Donna Noble (Doctor Who)

Donna Noble is a character in the British television series "Doctor Who". She is played by Catherine Tate. She is a secretary from Chiswick, London. She is a companion of the Tenth Doctor. She appears in one scene at the end of the last episode of the 2006 series, "Doomsday" (named in the credits only as "The Bride"), and in the second Christmas special, "The Runaway Bride". The character returned as The Doctor's full-time companion for the whole of the fourth series in 2008.
During the 2006 series Christmas episode "The Runaway Bride", Donna Noble is a temporary secretary at H.C. Clements in London, a security firm which, unknown to her, concealed the Torchwood Institute up until its collapse following the events of "Doomsday", and was then taken over by an alien intelligence. Her parents are Geoff and Sylvia Noble.
On Christmas Eve, the day of her wedding, she is accidentally pulled into the TARDIS because she has been drugged with Huon particles by her fianc√©, Lance Bennett, because he was told to do so by Empress of the Racnoss. She aids the Doctor in defeating the Racnoss Empress, but says no to his invitation to travel with him ‚Äî she is frightened not only by his adventures, but also by the Doctor himself. Having seen him commit genocide on the Racnoss, she urges him to find a new companion to act as his moral support. It was revealed later in "Turn Left" that the Doctor would have been killed while stopping the Racnoss if Donna was not there.
Reappearing in April 2008's Series four premiere, "Partners in Crime", Donna has become dissatisfied with regular life and more interested in the bigger picture. She regrets declining the Doctor's offer and has been investigating unusual phenomena in the hopes of finding the Doctor for some time. When investigating Miss Foster and Adipose Industries, the Londoner and the Time Lord are finally re-united. She expresses her regret to the Doctor for not joining him and after stopping Foster's plans to convert the whole of London into Adipose children she joins him in the TARDIS as a regular companion. She makes it explicit, however, that she has no romantic attachment to him as Martha Jones and Rose Tyler did.
In "The Fires of Pompeii", Donna continually argues with the Doctor over the moral issue of whether or not he should save the inhabitants of Pompeii from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius the next day. Ultimately, they are forced to cause the eruption to happen, weighing the destruction of the city against the fate of the whole world.
Donna was the Doctor's full time companion for all 13 episodes of Series 4. Her return to the series sees her with her maternal grandfather, recurring character Wilfred Mott, as well as her mother, Sylvia. Mott is played by Bernard Cribbins, whose appearance as a newspaper seller in Voyage of the Damned was merged into his new role following the death of Howard Attfield who played Donna's father in "The Runaway Bride". Donna has encountered the Racnoss, the Adipose, the Pyroviles, the Ood, the Sontarans, The Hath, Vespiforms, the Vashta Nerada, the Judoon, the Shadow Proclamation, and the Daleks. 
In the final episode of the fourth series Journey's End the Doctor erased Donna's memory of him and left her on Earth. He warned that she'd "burn up" if she remembered him.
Donna is involved in The End Of Time. At Donna's Marriage, The Doctor gives Sylvia a winning Lottery ticket before moving on to meet the first of his companions, Rose Tyler.

<doc id="147591" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147591" title="Master (Doctor Who)">
Master (Doctor Who)

The Master is a character in the British science fiction television series "Doctor Who". He is an evil Time Lord and is one of the biggest enemies of the Doctor.
When the Master first appeared in 1971, he was played by Roger Delgado. Delgado continued in the role until his death in 1973. Afterwards, Peter Pratt and Geoffrey Beevers played a decayed version of the Time Lord, until Anthony Ainley assumed the part in 1981. He remained until "Doctor Who"'s cancellation in 1989. In 1996, the Master was played by Eric Roberts in the TV movie. In the revived series, Derek Jacobi provided the character's re-introduction before handing over to John Simm, who portrayed the Master in the end of the 2007 series. Michelle Gomez took over the role in 2014.
The Master was once a childhood friend of the Doctor. In "The Sound of Drums" (2007), there is a brief clip of the young Master as the Doctor talks about his childhood. When they joined the Time Lord Academy at the age of eight, they were taken to look into the "Untempered Schism". This was a portal through which you could see the time vortex (the tunnel the TARDIS travels through as it travels in time) and see the full power of the Time Lords. He suggests that this is what made the Master went mad.
A would-be universal conqueror, the Master wants to control the universe (in "The Deadly Assassin" his ambitions were becoming "the master of all matter", and in "The Sound of Drums" he acknowledges that he chose his own name). His most distinctive ability is that of hypnotising people by fixing them with an intense stare, often accompanied by the phrase, "I am the Master, and you will obey me."
Some suspect that a character known as the War Chief in the episode "The War Games" is actually the Master in disguise. However, this has not been confirmed.
The Master and the Doctor are shown to have similar levels of intelligence, and were classmates on Gallifrey. This is mentioned several times in different stories ("The Five Doctors", "The Sea Devils" and "Terror of the Autons"). In the 2007 episode "Utopia", the Doctor calls the disguised Master a genius and shows an immense admiration for his intellect before discovering who he is.
Both the Doctor and the Master have been shown to be skilled hypnotists, although the Master's capacity to dominate ‚Äì even by stare and voice alone ‚Äì has been shown to be far more pronounced. The Master is also known to always survive death with no explanation other than "I escaped."
In the original "Doctor Who" series, the Master's TARDISes have fully functioning chameleon circuits and have appeared as many things.
By the time of the new series, it is unclear whether any of the Master's TARDISes still exist. In "Rise of the Cybermen", the Tenth Doctor claims that his TARDIS is the last one in existence although at the time of his saying this, he also thought he was the last Time Lord. In "Utopia", the Master resorts to stealing the Doctor's TARDIS, with no explanation of how he travelled from the Time War to the end of the universe.
The Master has also been featured in spin-offs of the series, which are of unclear canonicity and may not take place in the same continuity. The Master in these stories is, nevertheless, recognisably the same person.
One of the most important of these other appearances is David A. McIntee's "Master trilogy" of novels comprising "The Dark Path" and "First Frontier" in the Virgin Publishing lines and "The Face of the Enemy" for BBC Books, and the "Doctor Who" audio dramas produced by Big Finish Productions, in which Geoffrey Beevers has once again played the Master. Alex MacQueen has also played the Master in Big Finish audio dramas.
The Master returns in a new body and guise, that of a street preacher, in the previously mentioned "Doctor Who Magazine" (DWM) comic strip story "The Fallen", although the Doctor does not recognise him. The Master reveals himself a few stories later, in "The Glorious Dead" (DWM 287-296). The Master had survived the events of the television movie by encountering a cosmic being named Esterath in the time vortex. Esterath controls the Glory, the focal point of the Omniversal spectrum which underlies all existence. The Master's scheme to take control of the Glory fails, and he is banished to parts unknown (see Kroton). 
In "Character Assassin" (DWM 311), the Delgado Master visits the Land of Fiction and steals part of the technology behind it, wiping out several nineteenth century fictional villains as he goes. He can also be seen in the following comic strips set during the Pertwee era:
The "Doctor Who" role-playing game published by FASA in 1985 has two modules that give information about the Master. The modules identify the Meddling Monk as an alias the Master has used in the past.

Valentin Berlinsky (born Irkutsk, 19 January, 1925; died 15 December, 2008) was a Russian cellist. He played with the world-famous Borodin Quartet from 1945 when it was founded, and was a member until he retired in 2007.
Valentin Berlinsky was born in Irkutsk, Siberia. His father had learned the violin with the famous teacher Leopold Auer. He had formed his own string quartet, the Berlinksy Quartet, who had played in many parts of the Soviet Union. Valentin learned the violin from his father. Soon he was sent to Moscow where he studied the cello and played with the Moscow Youth Orchestra. He played in a student concert together with Mstislav Rostropovich in 1938.
For many years Berlinsky taught the cello at the Gnessin School of Music in Moscow. He did not often perform as soloist. He preferred being a member of a chamber music group.
In 1945 four young players formed a string quartet called the Moscow Conservatoire Quartet. Mstislav Rostropovich was the cellist, Rostislav Dubinsky and Nina Barshai played the violins and Rudolf Barshai played the viola. However, after a couple of weeks Rostropovich found he was too busy, so he suggested that Berlinsky should take his place. The four players that now formed the quartet signed an oath that they would be loyal and stay together as a group. They signed the oath with their own blood. Valentin often showed this piece of paper to people. For 60 years he kept a careful record of all the concerts they played. They called themselves the Borodin Quartet after the composer Alexander Borodin.
The four musicians first met Dmitri Shostakovich in 1946. They became famous for playing his string quartets. Shostakovich was to compose 15 string quartets. The Borodin Quartet were the most famous string quartet in the Soviet Union, but it was difficult for them to get permission to play in other countries until the fall of the Soviet Union.
Valentin Berlinsky retired from the Borodin Quartet in September 2007. His place was taken by his pupil, Vladimir Balshin, but Berlinsky still continued to help the quartet. 
He died on 15 December 2008, in Moscow, after a long illness. His daughter Lyudmila is a pianist.

Intern is the job title given to people who work in an organization which has an internship program. It is similar to an apprenticeship, but is the term more commonly used if the work takes place in office environments. The work in an internship is expected to be part of a desired learning experience for the intern. The specific requirements for being an intern vary widely.
Internship positions are posted online similarly to job postings, but focus instead on engaging students in real world projects before they have completed their studies. Internships are usually temporary positions, often lasting between one school term and one year. Internships may be paid or unpaid, dependent on the organization and type of work. Interns are sometimes given longer term job opportunities.

<doc id="147630" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147630" title="Symphonie Fantastique (Berlioz)">
Symphonie Fantastique (Berlioz)

The Symphonie fantastique is a symphony written by the French composer Hector Berlioz. It is one of the most famous Romantic works for orchestra. The official title of the piece is Episode de la Vie d‚Äôun Artiste (An Episode in the Life of the Artist), but it is always called by its subtitle "Symphonie Fantastique" which means "Fantasy Symphony". The ‚ÄúFantasy‚Äù refers to the story that is described by the music. ("Fantasy Symphony" is a better translation than "Fantastic Symphony" because "fantastique" is not like the modern meaning of the English word "fantastic").
The symphony lasts about 45 minutes and is divided into 5 movements. Berlioz himself wrote down the story that the music describes, just as Beethoven had done with his "Sixth Symphony". Berlioz‚Äôs work is about a young artist. In the music the young artist is represented by a tune. This tune is often heard during the symphony. That is why it is called an ‚Äú"id√©e fixe"‚Äù, which means a ‚Äúfixed idea‚Äù, i.e. an idea that keeps coming again and again. An "id√©e fixe" is what Wagner would have called a leitmotif (a tune which is always used to describe a particular person or thing in a piece of music). The first performance took place at the Paris Conservatoire in December 1830. Berlioz made several changes to the music between 1831 and 1845.
The symphony is played by an orchestra consisting of 2 flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes (2nd doubling cor anglais), 2 clarinets (1st doubling E-flat clarinet), 4 bassoons, 4 French horns, 2 trumpets, 2 cornets, 3 trombones, 2 ophicleides (originally one ophicleide and one serpent), 2 pairs of timpani, snare drum, cymbals, bass drum, bells in C and G, 2 harps, and strings.
The symphony is an example of programme music because it describes something apart from the music. In this case it describes a story. This is what the composer wrote:
First movement:
"A young artist was deeply in love with a girl who did not love him. He felt so desperately sad that he tried to poison himself with opium. He did not take enough to kill him. It just made him fall into a deep sleep. In this sleep he imagined all sorts of things. His beloved came to him in a dream. She changes into a musical theme (the "id√©e fixe") which he just cannot forget. He imagines her love and his tender feelings for her."
Second movement:
"He meets her at a ball. Everyone is dancing. He finds his beloved among the crowd."
Third movement:
"In the country he hears two shepherds who call to one another on their pipes. The trees sway gently in the wind. The young artist starts to feel happier. Then he sees his beloved again. He starts to worry that she may not want him any more. The shepherd music starts again, but it is only one of the shepherds playing. The sun sets. Far away a thunderstorm is heard."
The fourth movement:
"He dreams that he has killed his beloved in a fit of anger. He is now being taken to the scaffold where he will have his head chopped off. A march is played as he is taken away. For a moment he thinks of his beloved again, then the axe falls and he is executed."
The fifth movement:
"The artist is at the Witches‚Äô Sabbath. There are lots of ghosts and monsters around who have come to watch him being buried. His beloved is heard, but her tune now sounds horrible. She has come to the Sabbath. She joins the witches and they dance while the funeral music is heard."
The first movement has a slow introduction. The tune heard on the violins is already nearly like the "id√©e fixe". The "id√©e fixe" is heard in its full form when the music goes into the fast section. It is played by the violins and solo flute. The rhythm that the lower string instruments play underneath is very agitated. The form of the movement is not much like the traditional sonata form. Berlioz was more interested in the "id√©e fixe" which keeps haunting the young artist all the way through.
The ball (i.e. a party with dancing) is represented in the music by a lively waltz. The two harps make it sound very graceful. Twice the waltz is interrupted by the "id√©e fixe".
The two shepherds who are playing to one another are represented by a cor anglais (sitting in the orchestra) and an oboe which is played offstage so that it sounds distant. Then the main gentle countryside theme is heard on solo flute and violins. The "id√©e fixe" returns in the middle of the movement. The sound of distant thunder at the end of the movement is played by four timpani.
The movement starts with timpani rumbling and horns starting up the march theme. Then the cellos and double basses start the march in its full form, soon taken over by the violins. Just before he is executed there is a short repetition of the "id√©e fixe" on a solo clarinet, then the axe falls (a loud chord) and his head falls into the basket (one plucked note passed from the violins, through the violas, cellos and then double basses).
The "id√©e fixe" has now become a "vulgar dance tune", it is played on the E-flat clarinet. There are lots of effects, including ghostly "col legno" playing in the strings, the bubbling of the witches' cauldron played by the wind instruments. As the dance reaches a climax we hear the Dies Irae (Day of Judgement) melody together with the "Ronde du Sabbat" (Sabbath Round) which is a wild fugue.
In 1827 Berlioz went to a performance of Shakespeare‚Äôs play "Hamlet". It was played in English by a theatre group from England. Berlioz fell in love with Irish actress Harriet Smithson who played the part of Ophelia, He did not actually meet her, he just saw her acting on stage, but he sent her lots of love letters, but she left Paris without meeting him. He then wrote his Symphonie Fantastique. He then wrote the symphony to describe his love for her and his unhappiness because she was not interested in him. When Harriet heard the symphony two years after it was first performed, she realized that it was a symphony about her. She eventually met Berlioz and they were married on 3 October 1833. For several years the marriage was happy, although they did not speak one another‚Äôs language. However, after nine years they separated.

Mumia

Mumia (also pulvis mumiae, Mumia vera aegyptiaca) was a powder made from ground mummies. It was used as a drug, for good health, and as a coloring agent (a medium to dark brown) until the 1920s. Eating ground mumified corpses is a form of cannibalism.
The powder was said to work against almost any disease. To mummify a corpse, tar was used. It was said this tar had magical powers. It was also said to be an aphrodisiac.

Nuclear Nebraska

Nuclear Nebraska: The Remarkable Story of the Little County That Couldn‚Äôt Be Bought (ISBN 0814474306) is a 2007 book by Susan Cragin which follows the controversy about a proposed low level nuclear waste dump which was planned for Boyd County, Nebraska. 
In 1989, two multinational corporations and several government agencies put forward a proposal for the waste dump and offered payment of $3 million a year for 40 years. However, the residents of the largely uneducated Boyd County farming community chose to resist the offer and controversy followed for almost two decades. During this time, the community was transformed "from a small group of isolated farmers to a defiant band of environmentalists". The opposition of the community eventually succeeded, and the license to build the dump was denied.

Railways in Melbourne

Melbourne has a long history of railway building. The city's first railway opened in 1854, when in 1834 the city itself did not exist. The network then grew as lines were built throughout the suburbs, reaching a peak by the 1900s. Electrification of the system was carried out from 1919, with electric multiple unit operation starting at the same time.

Non-Nuclear Futures

Non-Nuclear Futures: The Case for an Ethical Energy Strategy is a 1975 book by Amory B. Lovins and John H. Price. The book says that the nuclear power debate is not about technical disputes but relates to different personal views (personal values). The personal values that make a high-energy society work are all too apparent, and the values associated with an alternate view relate to thrift, simplicity, diversity, neighbourliness, craftsmanship, and humility.
Lovins and Price say that these two different sets of personal values lead to two very different policy paths relating to future energy supplies. The first is high-energy nuclear, centralized, electric; the second is lower energy, non-nuclear, decentralized, less electrified, softer technology.

<doc id="147725" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147725" title="The Clean Tech Revolution">
The Clean Tech Revolution

The Clean Tech Revolution: The Next Big Growth and Investment Opportunity, is a 2007 book by Ron Pernick and Clint Wilder. They say that using clean technologies is a profitable enterprise that is moving steadily into mainstream business. Clean technologies are seen to be important for economic growth.
Pernick and Wilder highlight eight major clean technology areas: solar power, wind power, biofuels, green buildings, personal transportation, the smart grid, mobile applications (such as portable fuel cells), and water filtration. Very large corporations such as GE, Toyota and Sharp, and investment firms such as Goldman Sachs are spending billions of dollars on clean technology.
Pernick and Wilder say that, in the 1970s, clean technology was considered ‚Äúalternative‚Äù. Even at the start of the 21st century, the term "clean tech" was not yet widely used. But now, throughout much of the world, in trends large and small, there is "the beginning of a revolution that is changing the places where we live and work, the products we manufacture and purchase, and the development plans of cities, regional governments, and nations around the globe."
Pernick and Wilder highlight eight major clean technology sectors: solar power, wind power, biofuels, green buildings, personal transportation, the smart grid, mobile applications, and water filtration. The authors explain how investors, entrepreneurs, and individuals can profit from technological innovation in these areas. Pernick and Wilder identify some specific clean technologies, companies, and regions that are leading the way.
The book also explains that nuclear power and clean coal are not clean technologies. Apart from the risks associated with nuclear power, "multibillion-dollar nuclear plants are simply not cost-effective when compared with other energy sources." The authors also believe that "clean coal" is an oxymoron for a myriad of reasons, including the sheer number of coal mine-related deaths and the fact that coal-fired plants, even some cleaner ones, are major contributors to serious illnesses such as asthma, heart disease, and mercury poisoning.
Emerging clean tech cities are seen to include Copenhagen, where wind power generates 20 percent of Denmark's electricity, and Chicago, a leader in "green" buildings saving energy, heating and cooling costs.
Pernick and Wilder identify six major forces, which they call the six C‚Äôs, that are pushing clean technology into the mainstream and driving rapid growth and expansion: costs, capital, competition, China, consumers, and climate.
In a September 2007 article in "Renewable Energy Access" Wilder explains that, while some hurdles remain, the key solar trends mapped out in "The Clean Tech Revolution"‚Äîscaling up manufacturing and driving down costs‚Äîare coming to pass:
From the Nevada desert to the roofs of Wal-Mart stores to the legendary plains of Spain, solar is entering a bold, bright new era. Each week, solar seems to be winning new enthusiasts like Forbes, new investors of all stripes, and new large-scale business users like Wal-Mart, Macy's and Kohl's. Late last month, North Carolina Governor Mike Easley signed that state's first renewable portfolio standard into law, which includes a solar set-aside.
Investment money is pouring in, production lines are humming and expanding, the silicon shortage is being addressed, and the long-fought challenge of bringing solar to scale (the title of a 2002 Clean Edge report) is finally showing real hope. Last month, red-hot Chinese solar wafer supplier LDK Solar (whose second-quarter revenue grew 700%) announced manufacturing expansions that would raise its production capacity above 1,600 megawatts (MW) by the end of 2009. German solar cell producer Ersol Solar Energy just inked a contract for 1 billion euros to supply Germany PV module company Solon AG for 11 years.
Ernst & Young and Dow Jones VentureOne have reported that investments in clean technology companies in the first half of 2007 have reached $1.1 billion. The research found that clean technology investments are poised to increase by more than 35% in 2007 compared with 2006. Very large corporations such as GE, Toyota and Sharp, and investment firms such as Goldman Sachs are now making multi-billion dollar investments in clean technology.

David Suzuki: The Autobiography

David Suzuki: The Autobiography is the 2006 autobiography of Canadian science writer and broadcaster David Suzuki. The book focuses mostly on his life since the 1987 publication of his first autobiography, "Metamorphosis: Stages in a Life". It begins with a chronological account of his childhood, academic years, and broadcasting career. In later chapters, Suzuki adopts a memoir style, writing about themes such as his relationship with Australia, his experiences in Brazil and Papua New Guinea, the founding of the David Suzuki Foundation, and his thoughts on climate change, celebrity status, technology, and death. Throughout, Suzuki highlights the continuing impact of events from his childhood.
This is Suzuki's forty-third book and, he says, his last. Critics have called the book candid, sincere, and charming, with insightful commentary if occasionally flat stories. Suzuki's scientific background is reflected in the writing's rational and analytic style.
Suzuki's autobiography spent four weeks at #1 on the "Maclean's" list of non-fiction best-sellers and six weeks at #6 on the "Globe and Mail's" list. The book won two awards in 2007: the Canadian Booksellers' Association's Libris Award for Non-Fiction Book of the Year and the British Columbia Booksellers' Choice Award. The publishers, Greystone Books and Douglas & McIntyre, won the CBA Libris Award for Marketing Achievement of the Year.

James E. Hansen (born March 29, 1941 in Denison, Iowa) headed the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City, a part of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, Earth Sciences Division until early 2013. He is currently an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Columbia University. Hansen is best known for his research in the field of climatology, his testimony on climate change to congressional committees in the 1980s that helped raise broad awareness of the global warming issue, and his continuing advocacy of action to limit the impacts of climate change. He has been a critic of the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush Administration's stances on climate change.
Hansen studied astronomy and physics in the 1960s at the University of Iowa. He did scientific research on the atmospheres of other planets, and later Earth's atmosphere. Hansen was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1996 and he received a US$250,000 Heinz Environment Award
for his research on global warming in 2001. He was listed as one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the (2006) list and, in 2007, he shared the US$1 million Dan David Prize. On April 5, 2008, Dr. Hansen received the PNC Bank Common Wealth Award of Distinguished Service for his outstanding achievements in science.
Hansen posited in a 2007 paper that 350 ppm (parts per million) of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a safe upper limit to avoid a climate tipping point. The current record level is 389 ppm of CO, an almost 40-percent increase from the pre-industrial revolution level of 278 ppm. In 1988 the Earth's atmosphere surpassed the 350 ppm mark, while global CO emissions per capita rose.
Hansens strong public opposition to the exploitation of oil sands and the pipeline project created some controversy in the media. "Storms of My Grandchildren" is Hansen's first book about the climate change. In 2013, Hansen was co-author of an open letter saying "continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change."

Tarzan (1999 movie)

Tarzan is a 1999 animated movie produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation. produced by Walt Disney Pictures It is based on the story "Tarzan of the Apes" by Edgar Rice Burroughs. It was released by Walt Disney Pictures on June 18, 1999. It was the first Disney animated feature to start at #1 in the box office since "Pocahontas" and the first to contain a production budget of $100 million dollars since "The Hunchback of Notre Dame".
A British couple and their baby son escape from a ship which has caught fire in a storm. They become stranded off the African coast near uncharted jungles. The couple builds a treehouse to live in. They are later attacked and killed by a vicious leopard called Sabor. Meanwhile, a family of gorillas are travelling to their feeding grounds. One of them is Kala, whose own child was killed by the leopard. She hears the cries of the orphaned baby. She follows the sound across the jungle to the treehouse. She finds the child there. Sabor attacks her, but Kala and the baby escape without being hurt. They return to the gorilla family. Kala decides to raise the child as her own. She names him Tarzan. That makes her mate Kerchak angry. He tells her the baby will never replace the child they lost.
As a child, Tarzan makes friends with several animals and other gorillas in the family. They include the female ape Terk and the male elephant Tantor. Tarzan has trouble keeping up. One day, Terk and her friends dare Tarzan to get a hair from an elephant's tail. The dare goes wrong when the elephants stampede into the gorilla territory and almost kill a baby gorilla. However, Tarzan is able to get the hair. After Kerchak tells Kala that Tarzan will never be one of the family, Tarzan runs off into the jungle. Kala consoles him. He keeps trying. He learns how to do things from the animals of the jungle. He becomes a muscular apelike man. One day, Sabor attacks the gorillas and Tarzan kills her. This makes Kerchak respect him. 
A gunshot is heard. While the others go into the jungle, Tarzan decides to investigate. He sees a team of human explorers. The group includes Professor Porter, his daughter Jane and their hunter guide Clayton. They are in Africa looking for gorillas. Jane gets separated from the group. She is attacked by a troop of baboons. Tarzan saves her from them. He discovers that Jane and he are the same-humans. They go back to Jane's camp. Terk, Tantor and some gorillas from the troop are looking for Tarzan. They find the human campsite. They use the various items in the camp as instruments, and slowly destroy it. Tarzan and Jane arrive at the camp. When Clayton and Professor Porter get there, Tarzan goes with the gorillas into the jungle. Kerchak warns the other gorillas to stay away from the humans, but Tarzan says that the humans are not dangerous. He secretly continues his visits to the explorers. He learns about the human world. He and Jane fall in love.
When the explorer's boat arrives to take them back to England, Tarzan is sad to see Jane leaving. Clayton tricks Tarzan into believing that Jane will remain in Africa forever if he shows her the gorillas. Tarzan persuades Tantor and Terk to lead Kerchak away from the explorers. The plan seemingly works and Tarzan leads the explorers to the gorilla nesting grounds. The explorers are happy to mingle with the apes, but then Kerchak arrives and attacks the humans. Tarzan restrains him to save the explorers and leaves the troop, having alienated himself. When Kala finds him, staring off into the distance, she takes him to the treehouse where she found him as a baby. Tarzan then decides to go to England with the explorers.
The next day, as the group board the ship, a mutiny occurs and Tarzan and his friends are captured and detained in the brig, but not before Clayton reveals that he came to Africa to capture the gorillas and sell them to a zoo. He and his goons then enter the jungle and start capturing the gorillas. Fortunately, Tarzan and his friends escape with the aid of several animals from the jungle. Together, they free the gorillas and retaliate against the poachers. Clayton then shoots Tarzan, but only grazes his arm. When Kerchak comes to the ape man's aid, Clayton shoots him, but fatally injures him. He then chases Tarzan into the trees where a fight ensues. Tarzan briefly holds Clayton at gunpoint, before destroying the hunter's rifle. Clayton then attacks the ape man with a machete and starts wildly hacking vines, not knowing that one of them is round his neck like a noose. Despite Tarzan begging him to stop, he cuts the vines and the hunter is quickly hung to death.
Tarzan then approaches Kerchak, who is close to death. Kerchak then asks Tarzan to forgive him for not realising he has always been a member of the gorilla troop and passes his leadership on to Tarzan, before succumbing to his injuries. The ape man then becomes the new leader of the gorillas. The next day, Jane and her father prepare to leave. Jane then realises she loves Tarzan and she and her father then decide to remain in Africa. Tarzan and Jane then embark on their new life together.
Additional voices include Joseph Ashton, Jack Angel, Robert Bergen, Roger Bumpass, Jim Cummings, Debi Derryberry, Patti Deutsch, Blake Ewing, Jason Marsden, Phil Proctor, and Erik von Detten.
A spin-off television animated series named "The Legend of Tarzan" ran from 2001 to 2003. The series picks up where the movie left off. Tarzan is adjusting to his new role as leader of the apes following Kerchak's death.

Port Vale F.C.

Port Vale Football Club are an English football club currently playing in Football League Two. They are based in Burslem, Staffordshire ‚Äî one of six towns that make up the city of Stoke-on-Trent. The club's rivals in the city are Stoke City, games between the two clubs are known as the "Potteries derby". Games against Crewe Alexandra are also called a derby, although "Alex" are in south Cheshire.
Port Vale are not named after a place, which is unusual for an English league clubs. The two symbols on the clubs badge are a bottle kiln and the Stafford knot.
The Rec was Port Vale's home from 1913 to 1950. The Old Recreation Ground was in Hanley and stood on what is now the car park for the Potteries Shopping Centre. 
Vale Park has been Port Vale's home ground since 1950. Vale Park has a capacity of around 22,000.
Vale Park is not the oldest ground in the world, it has had several upgrades in its history. The original ground consisted of two stands (The Railway side and the Lorne Street main stand) with banks of terracing at the Bycars and Hamil ends of the ground. Stands were added behind each set of goals during the 1980s and 1990s as the ground began to be made more modern. The paddock at the front of the Railway Stand was also made into an all-seated area, with just the Lorne Street side now being left as a standing area. Vale fans stood for the last time on Lorne Street at the end of the 1997-98 season, with the stand being demolished before work began on a new ¬£3,000,000 structure. Work has yet to been finished on this, due to low funds and a change in ownership of the club. However, once new owners V2001 had taken care of the financing, work was finally begun on finishing the second half of the stand. It is due to be completed sometime in 2008.
Among the club's famous fan base is singer Robbie Williams, who was raised in Stoke-on-Trent. He is now a major shareholder, having, in February 2006, bought ¬£240,000 worth of the ¬£250,000 worth of available shares in the club. Castle Comfort Stairlifts, the club's sponsors, at the same time bought the remainder for ¬£10,000.
For the computer game FIFA 2000, he provided an original theme song with "It's Only Us", on the condition that Port Vale were included in the game, which they were, and are in the Rest of World section. This song was also featured on the only FIFA Soundtrack CD release by EMI.
In 2005 Williams founded Los Angeles Vale F.C., a Super Metro League team in the United States, named for Port Vale and based at his L.A. home.

Bird-of-paradise

The birds of paradise are songbirds of the family Paradisaeidae. They live in eastern Indonesia, Maluku, Papua New Guinea, Torres Strait Islands, and eastern Australia. Best known are the members of the genus "Paradisaea", including the type species, the greater bird-of-paradise, "Paradisaea apoda".
They live in tropical forests like rainforests, swamps and moss forest and build their nests from soft materials, such as leaves, ferns, and vine tendrils, typically placed in a tree fork.
They are best known for the remarkable plumage and behaviour of the males. They are an extreme example of how sexual selection works. Females choose males who they instinctively see are fine specimens of their species. The colours of the plumage, the construction of the nest, the song and the mating dance all play a part. In some species the pairing is monogamous, and in others the males are polygamous. If they are monogamous, the males look much like the females. If they are polygamous, the males are very much flashier than the females. In both cases, it is the female who makes the choice of partner.
Hunting for plumes and habitat destruction have reduced some species to endangered status. Habitat destruction due to deforestation is now the main threat.
Birds of paradise range in size from the King Bird of Paradise at 3¬†grams (1.8¬†oz) and 15¬†cm (6¬†in) to the Black Sicklebill at 110 cm (43 in) and the Curl-crested Manucode at 430¬†grams (15.2¬†oz).
Birds of paradise have bodies that look like a crow. They have stout or long bills and strong feet, with around two-thirds of the species being strongly sexually dimorphic.
In most species, the diet is mostly fruit, but riflebirds and sicklebills also prefer insects and other arthropods.

Songbird

Songbirds are the main group of birds in the order Passeriformes. They are the suborder Passeri, sometimes called 'oscines' (Latin for songbird). They are a genuine clade.
There are about 4000 species of songbird. Their "syrinx" (vocal organ) is able to produce varied and beautiful singing. They are a "very" successful group of birds, in fact they are the dominant birds on Earth today.
It seems songbirds evolved 50 million years ago in the part of Gondwana which later became Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea and Antarctica. They then spread around the world.
Their song mainly territorial: it communicates the identity and whereabouts of an individual to other birds. It also signals sexual intentions. Female preference in some populations is be based on the extent of a male's song repertoire. The larger a male's repertoire, the more females a male individual attracts. 
Bird calls are also used for alarms and contact. They are especially important in birds that feed or migrate in flocks. Although almost all birds give calls of some sort, well-developed songs are only given by a few lines outside the songbirds.
This is now known to be a paraphyletic group and so it is not used in modern systematics.
This is accepted as a clade.

Passerine

A passerine is a bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. They are songbirds which can perch. Most of them are small in size, and most can sing very well.
The passerines have a number of adaptations which, taken together, have made them highly successful, with many species round the world.
Evidence on their evolution comes from comparative anatomy, the fossil record and molecular biology. It is thought that the first passerines evolved in the southern continent of Gondwana in the Palaeogene, maybe around the Upper Palaeocene some 60‚Äì55 mya.
The early fossil record is poor because the first Passeriformes were on the small side, and their delicate bones did not preserve well. Two specimens from Queensland, Australia are fossil bone fragments clearly recognizable as passeriform. They are two species of about 10 and 20¬†cm in overall length. This proves that some 55¬†mya, barely into the early Eocene, early perching birds were recognizably distinct. It also suggests that the origin of this great order of birds was in the southern continent.
There are three sub-orders: "Acanthisitti", "Tyranni" and "Passeri". There are only two bird species in the sub-order Acanthisitti. They are known as New Zealand wrens. The sub-order Tyranni are also known as the suboscines. Many of these birds are found in tropical areas. The sub-order Passeri has the most bird species. They are also known as the oscines. They have the best songs of all birds.

The superb lyrebird ("Menura novaehollandiae") is a pheasant-sized songbird.
It is an Australian endemic species, about 100cm long. It has brown upper body plumage, grayish-brown below, rounded wings and strong legs. It is the longest and third heaviest of all songbirds. 
They are capable of mimicking a wide variety of sounds, including other bird's songs and man-made sounds like car alarms and chainsaws.

Lyrebird

A lyrebird is a ground-dwelling Australian bird. There are two species in the genus Menura. The live in forests, especially rainforests, of eastern Australia, and they were introduced to Tasmania in the 19th century. The are found in two National Forest areas of Victoria, New South Wales and southeast Queensland. 
They are most notable for their superb ability to mimic natural and artificial sounds from their environment. Since they live on the ground in fairly dense undergrowth, sound is used by the males to attract attention. When a female arrives, the visual display comes into action. It is a typical "female choice" mating system, where males defend a mating territory, and sing and display to get a mate.
The lyrebird's mimicked calls are learned from the local environment, including other birds. It takes young birds about a year to perfect their mimicked repertoire. The female lyrebirds of both species are also mimics, and will sing on occasion but the females do so with less skill than the males. A lyrebird classic is their imitation of human sounds in the forest such as car alarms, camera shutters and forest logging with chain-saws.
The breeding cycle of the lyrebirds is long, and lyrebirds are long-lived birds. They can live up to thirty years. They also start breeding later in life than other passerine birds. Female Superb Lyrebirds start breeding at the age of five or six, and males at the age of six to eight. Males defend territories from other males.Tthese territories may contain the breeding places of up to eight females. In a male's territory, he makes or uses display platforms.
The females each build an untidy nest, usually low to the ground in a moist gully, where each lays a single egg. She is the sole parent who incubates the egg over 50 days until it hatches, and she is also the sole carer of the lyrebird chick.

Albert's Lyrebird

The Albert's Lyrebird ("Menura alberti") is a pheasant-sized songbird, about 90¬†cm long, with brown upper body feathers and rich chestnut below. It is very similar with the Superb Lyrebird in its habits. This bird also mimics other species sounds. It is sometimes called the "Prince Albert Lyrebird" or the "Northern Lyrebird". Named after Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, they are smaller than the Superb Lyrebirds.
Albert's Lyrebirds are only found in a small area of rainforest in the Lamington National Park near the border of Queensland and New South Wales. There are about 3,500 birds known to exist. There are reports of the birds in the Blackall Range, but this has not been proved. Known groups of birds live on Tamborine Mountain, Scenic Rim and the Nightcap Range.
They eat small insects which they scratch up from the ground. They are a shy bird which will run or fly away if disturbed. During the breeding season in winter, from May to August, the male bird performs displays of song and dance to attract the females. The songs are copied from other birds and forest sounds. The songs can last up to four hours, with some individual songs lasting up to one hour. During his dance, the male bird raises his tail feathers up and over his body. The feathers form a lyre shape which is why they were given the name "lyrebird".
It is listed as a Vulnerable species because it lives in such a limited area, it can only eat a small range of food from that area, and it is not breeding quickly.

Piciformes are order of birds contain about 67 living genera with a little over 400 species, of which the Picidae (woodpeckers and relatives) make up about half. Amost all live in woods (arboreal).
In general, the Piciformes are insectivorous, though the barbets and toucans mostly eat fruit and the honeyguides are unique among birds in digesting beeswax (though insects make up most of their diet). 
Nearly all Piciformes have parrot-like zygodactyl feet‚Äîtwo toes forward and two back, an arrangement that has obvious advantages for birds that spend much of their time on tree trunks. An exception are a few species of three-toed woodpeckers. The jacamars aside, Piciformes do not have down feathers at any age, only true feathers. They range in size from the rufous piculet at 8 centimetres in length, and weighing 7¬†grams, to the toco toucan, at 63 centimetres long, and weighing 680¬†grams. All nest in cavities (holes) and have altricial young, meaning they have to look after their chicks for quite a long time.

After some years, Orbetello was captured by the Sienese Republic. In the mid-16th century it was part of the Spanish puppet State of Presides, becoming its capital. Later it was under the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and, from the late 19th century, the new Kingdom of Italy.

The area was settled by man from at least the 4th millennium BC. In 1269 it was the seat of a famous battle during the wars of Guelphs and Ghibellines and in 1479 it was attacked by Neapolitan soldiers. From the 14th century it was under the control of the city of Florence and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany until the unification of Italy in 1860. In the 20th century it became an important industrial town. During World War II it was bombed by Allied aircraft.

British Rail Class 141

The British Rail Class 141 was the first production model of the Pacer diesel multiple units.
They were created because then British Rail had a large shortage of trains so rather than spending lots of money on expensive proper trains, they invented the Pacer. British Leyland at the time had a surplus in the production of bus bodies so the idea was to weld the bus body from an old bus on to a freight waggon chassis. The result of this was that pacers have notoriously poor suspension and are noisier around corners due to flanging (the squeaky noise that you'll sometimes hear when travelling by train). This makes them non-ideal passenger trains so they are now being replaced (or have been replaced in the case of the class 141) by new trains.

Functional illiteracy

Functional illiteracy means that a person is not able to read, write, and do math well in regular life. Someone who is fully illiterate can not read, write, or do math at all. Such people have perhaps never learnt how to read or write; perhaps they did not need to. A person who is functionally illiterate is different - at some point in their lives, these people were taught reading and writing skills. For different reasons, adults who are functionally illiterate try to avoid writing and reading as much as possible. That way, a person who is functionally illiterate may be able to write their name, but it is very difficult for them to write more than a few sentences.
These people have trouble functioning in modern society: when they are confronted with printed materials they cannot perform simple tasks such as filling out a form, understanding a contract, following written instructions, reading a newspaper article, traffic signs, consulting a dictionary, or understanding a bus schedule.
Because of functional illiteracy, these people also have a lot of trouble using modern communication technologies, such as a personal computer or a mobile phone.
The people who are functionally illiterate often have other problems as well: Other people may bully them, they may have higher health risks, and stress. Because they cannot get good jobs, they often earn little money.
Crime-researchers and sociologists have talked about the link between functional illiteracy and crime.
"Business" magazine estimates that 15 million functionally illiterate adults had a job in the United States at the start of the 21st century. The American Council of Life Insurers reported that 75% of the Fortune 500 companies provide some level of training to help their workers overcome this situation. All over the U.S 30 million - 14% of adults - are unable to perform simple and everyday literacy activities. 
The National Center for Education Statistics has more detail.
This report sees three parameters: prose, document, and quantitative literacy. There are four levels for each parameter: below basic, basic, intermediate, and proficient. For prose literacy, for example, a below basic level of literacy means that a person can look at a short piece of text to get a small piece of uncomplicated information. Similarly, a person who is "below basic" in quantitative literacy might be able to add two numbers.
In the US, 14% of adults are at the "below basic" level for prose literacy; 12% are at the "below basic" level for document literacy; and 22% are at that level for quantitative literacy. Only 13% of the population is proficient in these three areas. In the terms of the study, "proficient" means these people are able to compare viewpoints in two editorials. They can interpret a table about blood pressure, age, and physical activity. They can also compute and compare the cost per ounce of food items.
In the UK, according to the "Daily Telegraph" (14¬†June¬†2006) "one in six British adults lacks the literacy skills of an 11-year-old". The UK government's Department for Education reported in 2006 that 47 percent of school children left school at age 16 without having achieved a basic level in functional maths, and 42 percent fail to achieve a basic level of functional English. Every year 100,000 pupils leave school functionally illiterate in the UK.
A Literacy at Work study, published by the Northeast Institute in 2001, found that business losses attributed to basic skill deficiencies run into billions of dollars a year due to low productivity, errors, and accidents attributed to functional illiteracy.
Sociological research has demonstrated that countries with lower levels of functional illiteracy among their adult populations tend to be those with the highest levels of scientific literacy among the lower stratum of young people nearing the end of their formal academic studies. This correspondence suggests that a contributing factor to a society's level of civic literacy is the capacity of schools to ensure students attain the functional literacy required to comprehend the basic texts and documents associated with competent citizenship.

The British Rail Class 153 "Sprinter" is a single-car diesel multiple unit train.
In the early 1990s, British Rail took the decision that running 2-car trains on rural routes was inefficient, and identified the need for single-carriage trains. Initially consideration was given to splitting the Met-Cam Class 156 units to form class 152 units, however due to various problems with the Class 155 units, the decision was taken to split these units instead.
Work was undertaken by Hunslett-Barclay in Kilmarnock between 1991 and 1992. The modifications included fitting a cramped cab to the B end of each carriage, making it extremely difficult to load a bicycle!

As well as the class number, British Rail reserved carriage numbers in the 526xx and 576xx series for these units.
As the Privatisation of British Rail began, this project became unviable as resources were concentrated on the privatisation process, leading to the famous 1064-day 'drought' of new train orders.

As opposed to the previous Pullman Car Company locomotive-hauled carriage trains, and the Brighton Belle electrical multiple units, the Blue Pullmans were the first diesel-electric multiple units designed for high-speed Pullman train services incorporating several novel features. Named after their custom blue livery, the trains were conceived under the railway 1955 Modernisation Plan, to create new luxury first-class diesel express trains, to compete with the motor car and the emerging domestic air travel market. Although not entirely successful in their own right, the Blue Pullmans demonstrated the possibility of high-speed fixed-formation multiple-unit Inter City train services and inspired the later development of the Inter City 125.

The British Rail Class 303 is a type of electric multiple unit. They are also known as "Blue Train" units. They were introduced in 1960 for the electrification of the North Clyde and the Cathcart Circle lines in Strathclyde. At first they were classified as AM3 units before the introduction of the TOPS classification system. They were the dominant EMU on the Glasgow suburban railway network for over 25 years. The final units were withdrawn from service in 2002.

British Rail Class 304

The British Rail Class 304 is a type of electric multiple unit. They were built for suburban use on the first phases of the West Coast Main Line electrification between Crewe and Manchester/Liverpool/Rugby. They were at first classed as AM4 units and later became Class 304 under the TOPS numbering system. They could be found in operation over most of the southern West Coast Main Line. The units conformed to the 1959-design for alternating current (AC) electrical multiple units, and were externally very similar to the Class 305, Class 308 and the 1,200 V direct current (DC) class Class 504 units. No units survived preservation, and all units were eventually scrapped.

British Rail Class 321

The British Rail Class 321 alternating current (AC) electric multiple units (EMU) were built by BREL York in three batches from 1986-1989. The design was very successful and led to the development of the similar Class 320 and Class 322 units for use by Strathclyde PTE and Stansted Express (now used by First ScotRail) respectively. The bodyshell design was also used for construction of the Class 456 direct current (DC) units. The Class 321s were nicknamed 'Dusty Bins', due to the class number sharing the same name as the game show 3-2-1. (This name has also been given to the diesel multiple unit (DMU) Class 153 no. 153321 for the same reason).
Class 321s were originally built for the Bedford services. However, in 1990, they started being used on Great Eastern Main Line services to Southend Victoria, Braintree and Clacton, to replace the class 302 and 305 EMUs, many of which were approaching 50 years old. Some 321s (many of the 3214s) were sent to work inter-regional services for Silverlink, and then briefly for London Midland, primarily on Euston to Northampton/Milton Keynes/Tring services.

Anti-nuclear movement in California

The 1970s proved to be a pivotal period for the anti-nuclear movement in California. There was confrontation between nuclear power advocates and environmentalists. In 1981, 1,900 activists were arrested during protests at Diablo Canyon Power Plant. In 1984, the Davis City Council declared the city to be a nuclear free zone. California has banned the approval of new nuclear reactors since the late 1970s because of concerns over waste disposal.
The start of the anti-nuclear movement in California was the controversy over Pacific Gas & Electric's attempt to build the nation's first nuclear power plant in Bodega Bay. This conflict began in 1958 and ended in 1964, with the forced abandonment of these plans. Subsequent plans to build a nuclear power plant in Malibu were also abandoned.
The anti-nuclear movement grew in California between 1964 and 1974. It was during this period that some scientists and engineers began supporting the positions of the activists. They were influenced by the non-material philosophy that had inspired activists and had impacted the public consciousness. While Californian voters failed to pass a 1972 proposal placing a 5-year moratorium on nuclear plant construction, anti-nuclear groups campaigned to stop construction of several proposed plants in the seventies, especially those located on the coast and near fault lines. These proposals included the Sundesert Nuclear Power Plant, which was never built.
Over a two-week period in 1981, 1,900 activists were arrested at Diablo Canyon Power Plant. It was the largest arrest in the history of the U.S. anti-nuclear movement.
In this period there were controversies within the Sierra Club about how to lead the anti-nuclear movement, and this led to a split over the Diablo Canyon plant which ended in success for the utilities. The split led to the formation of Friends of the Earth, led by David Brower.
In 1979, Abalone Alliance members held a 38-day sit-in in the Californian Governor Jerry Brown's office to protest continued operation of Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station, which was a duplicate of the Three Mile Island facility. In 1989, Sacremento voters voted to shut down the Rancho Seco power plant.
California has banned the approval of new nuclear reactors since the late 1970s because of concerns over waste disposal.
On November 14th 1984 the Davis, California City Council declared the city to be a nuclear free zone. Another well-known nuclear-free community is Berkeley, California, whose citizens passed the Nuclear Free Berkeley Act in 1986 which allows the city to levy fines for nuclear weapons-related activity and to boycott companies involved in the United States nuclear infrastructure.

Lachlan Macquarie

Major-General Lachlan Macquarie CB (31 January 1762 ‚Äì 1 July 1824) was a British military officer and the fifth Governor of New South Wales from 1810 to 1821. He had a leading role in the social, economic and architectural development of Australia. Historians say he changed New South Wales from a penal colony to a free settlement. This was very important in making the future of Australian society. 
Macquarie was born on the island of Ulva, in the Inner Hebrides, Scotland. His father had a small farm at Oskamull on Mull. Macquarie's brother Donald, died as a prisoner of war during the American Revolution. Macquarie joined the army, the Royal Highland Emigrants. He was sent to Nova Scotia in 1776, and later served at New York and Charleston. In 1781 he became a Lieutenant and went to Jamaica for three years. He went back to Scotland, for a few years on half pay. He then joined the 77th Regiment and went to India.
Macquarie was able to advance in rank a number of times which helped him pay off his debts. In 1793 he married Jane Jarvis. She was the daughter of the former Chief Justice of Antigua, who was living in Bombay. In 1795 Macquarie fought the Dutch on Ceylon. In 1796 he became the Governor of Ceylon. He had go back to his wife who was ill. She died from tuberculosis at Macao, in China, on 15 July 1796. He brought her body back to India and she was buried in Bombay on 16 January 1797. He stayed in the army and fought at the Battle of Seringapatam. In 1800 he became the military secretary to the Governor of Bombay. In 1801, Macquarie went to Egypt to fight the French. Later, after the French were defeated, he became deputy adjutant general, in charge of the remaining British forces. He went back to Bombay in 1802. He then went to Scotland to sort out his business affairs.
Macquarie had become quite rich during his time in India, as was able to buy 10,000 acres on Mull. During his stay in England he was made the assistant adjutant general of London when war started again with the French. In 1804, he met Elizabeth Campbell who would later become his second wife. He served in Bombay again for several years, before going back to Britain in 1807 to join the 73rd Regiment. He married Elizabeth in Devon, before going to Perth. The 73rd Regiment was going to be posted to Australia to replace the New South Wales Corps, and Macquarie was told he would be the new Governor of New South Wales. He was to take over from William Bligh who had been removed from power during the Rum Rebellion. He arrived in December 1809, and took up his new job as governor on 1 January 1810.
He was ordered to arrest John Macarthur and George Johnston who were the leaders of the Rum Rebellion but they had already sailed to England before he got to Australia. There was a large increase in the number of convicts sent to Australia while Macquaire was governor. He used the extra convicts to build roads, building, and towns. He gave tickets of leave to well behaved convicts. This caused him problems with the free settlers, people who had not been convicts. They thought they should have special rights, and that the convicts should not be seen as their equals. They made many complaints about Macquarie's government back to their friends in England.
Clashes between the settlers and the Aborigines increased. Macquarie believed that the best way to treat Aboriginal people was to 'civilise' them. That meant replacing their traditional way of life with European ways. He set up a school for children but most left or went back to their families after a short time. He tried to make a small town to teach the Aborigines how to farm and build houses. He made laws to place Aborigines under British control. 
Macquarie resigned at the end of 1821 because of poor health and the difficulty of the job. He served longer than any other governor. When he left 265 major works had been completed, including new army barracks, three convict barracks, roads to Parramatta, a road across the Blue Mountains, stables, a hospital and five towns along the Hawkesbury River, which were out of reach of floodwaters.
In 1822 and 1823 Macquarie took his family on a holiday to France, Italy and Switzerland. In 1824 he went back to live in his house on Mull. In April 1824 he died in London from a bladder and kidney infection. His body was sent back to his home for burial. His grave is now looked after by the National Trust of Australia.

Their introduction saw the withdrawal of the last of Glasgow's old Class 303 "Blue Train" sets which had been in service since 1960.
Their introduction saw the withdrawal of the last of Glasgow's old Class 303 "Blue Train" trains which had been in service since 1960. Although delivered to Strathclyde in 1999-2002, they did not enter passenger service until 2001 due to a large number of problems (like other newly delivered Juniper trains) and technical issues which plagued the new units at their introduction. SPT had ordered 38 Juniper units originally, but two were added to the order as a goodwill gesture, because of these problems.
SPT purchased a total of 40 units, although only paying for 38 of the units (2 were given free, with the reason stated above) which can be seen in use daily across the SPT electric network. On the first running of the units, 334010 and 334020 ran to Gourock. Initially the units ran Ayrshire Coast Line and Inverclyde Line services but then become a common sight on the Argyle Line and North Clyde Line.
In December 2010, the Class 334s operated the Ayrshire Coast Line, Inverclyde Line, North Clyde Line and Argyle Line.
By June 2011 the class was substantially replaced by the Class 380 units on the Ayrshire Coast Line and Inverclyde lines, with only occasional units seen on those routes, to be refurbished.
In September 2008, the Scottish Government's agency Transport Scotland announced that all "ScotRail" trains (including from the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport) would be eventually repainted in a new, blue livery with white Saltire markings on the carriage ends. Class 334 re-livery began in November 2010 in preparation for the Airdrie to Bathgate reopening.
On 24 August 2011, ScotRail announced plans to refurbish all the fleet, with the project expected to start in November 2011 and take two years to complete. 334020 was the first to be properly refurbished at Kilmarnock's Brodie Rail Works. It was there for 3 months from 3 February 2012 to 2 May 2012. The last unit to receive a full refresh was 334006 which left Brodie Works on 8 November 2014.
From early 2015, an extensive overhaul will be carried out by Alstom to the entire fleet to improve passenger conditions, which will include the retrofitting of full air conditioning, at-seat charging points, provision for wi-fi, and reliability improvements to the doors. Additionally, a new CCTV system for Driver Only Operation will be installed.

British Rail's Class 370 tilting trains, also referred to as APT-P (meaning Advanced Passenger Train Prototype), were the pre-production Advanced Passenger Train units. Unlike the earlier experimental gas-turbine APT-E unit, these units were powered by 25kV AC overhead electrification and were used on the West Coast Main Line between London Euston and Glasgow Central. The APT-P is the most powerful domestic train to have operated in Britain, the eight traction motors fitted to the two central Motor Cars giving a total output of 8,000 hp. This enabled the train to set the UK rail speed record of 162.2¬†mph in December 1979, a record that stood for 23 years.

<doc id="148226" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=148226" title="Cyberman">
Cyberman

The Cybermen are a fictional race of cyborgs in the British television series "Doctor Who". They are one of the greatest and longest enemies of the Doctor. Cybermen were originally humanoids from the Earth's twin planet Mondas. The people of Mondas began to put more and more artificial metal parts into their bodies to keep themselves alive, making them cyborgs. This led to the race starting to think logically and calculating, showing no emotions. The Cybermen also turning other people into cyborgs.
They were created by Dr. Kit Pedler (the unofficial scientific advisor to the programme) and Gerry Davis in 1966, first appearing in the serial, "The Tenth Planet", which was the last to feature William Hartnell as the First Doctor. They have since been in the show a lot.
A parallel universe version of the Cybermen appeared in the 2006 series in the two-part story, "Rise of the Cybermen" and "The Age of Steel". They also appear in "Army Of Ghosts" and "Doomsday". They also appeared in the spin-off series "Torchwood" in the episode "Cyberwoman". They would later return to the new series in the 2008 Christmas Special "The Next Doctor", introducing two new types of cyberman; the Cyber-Shades and the Cyber-King. 
While the Doctor's other old enemies the Daleks did not change during the original series's twenty-six season run, the Cybermen were seen to change with almost every appearance. The Cybermen are humanoid, but have replaced their limbs and other body parts with non-living parts to the point where they don't have many flesh parts. In their first appearance in the series, the only portions of their bodies that still seemed human were their hands, but by their next appearance in "The Moonbase" (1967), their bodies were entirely covered up in their metal suits, with their hands replaced by two finger claws, but changed back to regular five finger hands in "The Invasion" (1968). As there are not many of them, the Cybermen often convert humans to cybermen.
It is assumed(and often implied) that there are still human parts beneath their suits, meaning they are actually cyborgs, not robots: in "The Tenth Planet", a Cyberman tells a group of humans that "our brains are just like yours", although by the time of "Attack of the Cybermen", their brains seem to have been replaced with electronics. In "Earthshock" (1982), the actors' chins were vaguely visible through a clear perspex area on the helmet to suggest some kind of human face. In "The Tomb of the Cybermen" (1967), veins were visible through the circular head of the Cyberman Controller and in "Attack of the Cybermen" (1985) and "The Age of Steel" (2006), the Cyber-Controller's brain is visible through the dome. The first is a Mondas Cyber Controller, while the second is an alternative cyberman. However, in "Revenge of the Cybermen" (1975), the Doctor says they are "total machine creatures".
Although the Cybermen often claim that they have done away with human emotion, they have exhibited emotions ranging from anger to smug satisfaction in their confrontations with the Doctor (although this is only clearly present during their appearances in the 1980s). Some Cybermen in the early stories were even given individual names such as "Krang". Some parallel Earth Cybermen did retain some memories of their pre-conversion lives, although their emotional response varied
This motive behind the removal of emotions is made more clear in "The Age of Steel" where it is done by putting in things that keep them from feeling emotions. In that episode, the deactivation of their emotional inhibitors drives the converted Cybermen insane when they realise what they have become, killing them. This motive may also be applicable to Mondas Cybermen, given their forcible conversion of other lifeforms to Cybermen to maintain their numbers, despite the fact the Mondasians appear to have originally willingly converted themselves as a survival mechanism.
Cybermen have a number of weaknesses over the years. Their biggest weakness is gold. It was not mentioned that they did not like gold until their attempt to destroy the planetoid Voga (the so-called "Planet of Gold") in "Revenge of the Cybermen" (1975). Initially, it was explained that, because it is very hard to grind up, gold chokes their respiratory systems. For example, the However, in later serials, gold appeared to affect them rather like silver affects werewolves, with gold coins or bullets with gold on the edge fired at them having the same effect. The revived series' Cybermen have no weakness to gold.
Nearly all the cyberman costumes were silver in colour and included items and material such as cloth, rubber diving suits, PVC, chest units, tubing, practice golf balls, cricketers' gloves, and silver-painted Doc Martens boots. A BBC Cyberman costume from the black & white era of TV has recently been discovered.
The 1980s design used converted flight suits painted silver. Unlike the Doctor's other enemies, the Cybermen have changed a lot in appearance over the years, looking more and more modern, although retaining certain commonalities of design, the most iconic being the "handle bars" attached to Cybermen heads, that were supposed to aid with their hearing, their round eyeholes and their chest units. Completely black-coloured Cybermen were seen briefly in "Attack of the Cybermen".
The Cybermen returned in episodes 5 and 6 of the 2006 season of the new series, in a two-part story set on an alternate Earth. The new Cybermen were designed by production designer Edward Thomas's team and Neill Gorton at Millennium FX. The new Cyberman design is tall, in a style reminiscent of Art Deco, with their Cybus Corporation logo on their chests and made to look like burnished steel instead of silver. The other big changes in the Cyberman design is that the Cyber-Controller had glowing eyes, a transparent forehead revealing the brain, and sockets on its chest-plate providing connectors to other systems.
Early Cybermen had an unsettling, sing-song voice, created by changing their voices slightly on syllables which a voice does not normally change. Their mouths opened fully and did not move when they were talking, then their mouths would shut as soon as they stopped talking. However they stopped doing this after their first few appearances.
The voices for the 2006 return of the Cybermen were provided by Nicholas Briggs (who performed the voices for the Cybermen in Big Finish audio stories as well as the Daleks in both the new series and the audio stories). Shown in the season 2 DVD special feature "Confidential Cut Downs," the voice was created by processing Brigg's voice through a voice modulator. The new Cybermen have a blue light in their "mouths" which blinks in synchronisation with their speech.
The Cybermen also use smaller, cybernetic creatures called "cybermats" to attack. In their first appearance in "The Tomb of the Cybermen", they resembled big metal fish and had segmented bodies with hair sensor probes along the base of their heads, which were topped with eyes. The Second Doctor described them as a "form of metallic life,".
The second model of cybermat seen in "The Wheel in Space" was used for sabotage, able to listen to human brainwaves. They were carried to the "Wheel" in small sacs that sank through the walls of the space station, causing drops in air pressure.
The third model, seen in "Revenge of the Cybermen", was a much larger, snake-like cybermat that could be remotely controlled and could inject poison into its victims.
Cybermats appear in Blood of the Cybermen. They look like flat snakes, and can turn living things into Cyber-Slaves with their poison. They are remote controlled, and are of the new, 3rd race of cybermen. They are Cyber Cats and Dogs.
On the BBC website, the Cybus Cybermen appear in two online games, Cyber Assault and Save Paris, both depicting the war between the Cybermen and Preachers on the parallel Earth. The Adventure Games has an episode, Blood of the Cybermen, which feature a 3rd, new race of Cybermen.

I have lots of plans for 2009 ;)
Firstly, I will be RfAing in the early stages of next year, and I hope that that passes and I can serve the wiki further. On the subject of Rf*'s, I expect us to get another 'crat and at least 2 more admins (not including myself).
On the article front, I will continue with British Rail Classes, and then expand onto Steam, Departmentals and eventually TOCs, Makers etc. Then i'll expand outwards on the transport front, and also do some on Derbyshire and London. My big plan is to create the 50,000 article ;)
I also hope to write at least 1 VGA and 2 GAs - I think this is possible, and I already have Crich Tramway Village at PGA.
On the wiki front, hopefully the flood flag will be enabled, and I also hope for the project to become more active and we can have "proper" WikiProjects ;).
I will also be planning to bring GBot3 online, and GBot4 is in the pipeline.
Finally, on the Wikicup: It would be bad for me to make predictions as a judge, but i'm just going to say that some of the groups are very hard, and I wish the best of luck to everyone!
Happy New Year everyone!

Anatidae is the biological family of birds that includes the ducks, geese and swans. 
These birds are common and widespread, and live in or near water. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution, on all the world's continents except Antarctica and on most of the world's islands and island groups. 
These are birds that are adapted for swimming, floating on the water surface, and in some cases diving. The family has about 146 species in 40 genera. They are usually herbivorous, and are monogamous breeders. A number of species do annual migrations. A few species have been domesticated for agriculture, and many others are hunted for food and recreation. Five species have become extinct since 1600, and others are close to extinction.

Hello all,
I'm here to propose that the Nation's Cup of the Wikicup be shut down. It's causing way too much dramaz, and is actually detracting from the whole point of the cup. People are more worried about who they are going to be on a team with rather than actually getting on with preparing and editing. The countries saga is just ridiculous as well.
I also don't see how having a team cup will help at all, except making more work for myself and Gwib.

Cheers,
I suppose you could do propose it on Wikia, but you can't run it as an affiliation of WMF without approval. -- ¬†() 22:28, 22 December 2008 (UTC)
We need less useless projects destined to fail, not another one. Look at what happened to Simple Wikiquote. It's become a playground for SwirlBoy, American Eagle, and there have been no (correct me if I'm wrong) non-native-English speakers that contribute in its history. This is obviously not worth the bandwidth, time, or space to discuss, let alone set up the project. 01:20, 23 December 2008 (UTC)
Can someone please allow non-registered users to completely remove the "Donate Now!" banner, which is virtually pushing one, coercing them, to fill Jimbo's pockets. Can you at lease give the anonymous users the "opportunity" to get a break from this annoying crap without having to create an account? Forcefeeding them an exaggerating, saccharine beg for money from Jimbo isn't helping. Just as one can remove the Wikicup notice, can that option please replace "collapse"? 01:25, 23 December 2008 (UTC)
Yecch, Jimbo's overpowering kool-aid has been spread all over the place. I'm not thirsty, and I'm sure many readers aren't either. 
Edit 01:34, 23 December 2008 (UTC): I may come off as too harsh, but I just don't think we should be forced to donate, or pushed so hard. 
Does it really harm you that much? I mean just ignore it. Do you think it costs nothing to maintain this site? I mean everyone is welcome to contribute in their own way, either by editing or donating or whatever. If you don't want to donate, then don't do it, no one is holding a gun to your head to make you donate. The banner isn't going to harm you and is a necessary evil to you know have a wiki that can actually be edited... - () 14:12, 23 December 2008 (UTC)
Dsjasso: I was actually talking about logged-out users, who happen not to have an account, for personal reasons, or those who have not pursued account creation yet. And yes, it is quite annoying, especially since Jimbo got rich off of futures trading and that WP gets enough donationa from the "E-yuppie techie" crowd like Roger McNamee. I 'donate' by writing articles and contributing to discussions regarding community governance. 
Bluegoblin: The collapse button is just the lesser of two annoyings.
Kennedy: For your reference, the word is spelled "privelige". 15:40, 23 December 2008 (UTC)
Thank you, Peter. Bluegoblin: I'm tired of seeing Jimbo beg. And "most anons do not contribute to the encyclopedia constructively"? Can you please show evidence of this? I don't believe it. Also, some users (hi, Majorly) don't contribute to the encyclopedia much at all. I am complaining because I don't think that anons should be pushed to give to Wikipedia. You've already got 3 million dollars, give it a rest for those people who are tired of seeing you ask for money. Poor Jimbo. 15:58, 23 December 2008 (UTC)
I did not personally attack. I did not state that Majorly was not constructive period, I stated that he was not that much of a contributor to the encyclopedic part of Wikipedia, which I did on the basis of a statement that Majorly himself made. "I barely edit the encyclopedia on Simple" Please do not misinterpret that as a personal attack, as it would be no more of a personal attack than to accuse me of not contributing to the encyclopedia more than I do to discussion. 16:17, 23 December 2008 (UTC)
Just because a person chooses to not have an account and edit from an IP doesn't mean they shouldn't be asked to donate any less than someone who has. They read the encyclopedia just like anyone else. Just because Jimbo does or does not have money doesn't enter into it, the foundation is a seperate entity. Just because you don't like to read a banner that can be collapsed doesn't mean it should be gone. It isn't harming you in any way, nor is it harming IP editors I am sure. And yes Jonas you comments towards majorly were a personal attack because your whole basis of arguement is that you can contribute in many ways to the encyclopedia and not just one. Majorly doesn't edit articles much but he does other things to contribute to the encyclopedia. - () 16:33, 23 December 2008 (UTC)
Could someone please advise me? I have just created the page Op√©ra-Comique (opera house). This is a page about the opera house. The enwiki page on this subject is called Op√©ra-Comique. I would normally give my new page the same title as on enwiki. There is already a page (which I created a little while ago) on Op√©ra-comique (small case c). This is about the genre of French comic opera. It links to the enwiki page of the same title.
When I wanted to create my page about the opera house just now I was unable to do so, because typing "Op√©ra-Comique" in the search just redirected to the existing Op√©ra-comique page. I could see no way round it other than to change the title to Op√©ra-Comique (opera house), which is what I did. However, when I then went to the Op√©ra-comique page and clicked on the red link to Op√©ra-Comique it opened up a box headed "Op√©ra-Comique" for me to create an page. So I could have done it that way? 
Two questions really: why did this happen? Secondly: having done what I have shall I leave it or should I change (move) the title to conform to enwiki title? Indeed, will I be able to move it? Thanks in advance. () 22:36, 23 December 2008 (UTC)

The problem that I have with the simple version is that if this project is intended for children, then there needs to be a rating level. Articles that would not pass a movie rating of PG or PG-13 should not be in here. Does a child really need to see a video of a man ejaculating or even read an article about a man ejaculating or see diagrams of men and women masterbating? IMO, if a child is interested in that content they should read the adult article with their parents. Maybe include a simplified sub-heading on the main article that is intended for high school and middle school children.
Why do we need an wikipedia in simple English for ESL adults? Why can't they just read an article in their native language? Or why not just read the regular article? How many adults do you know of who can't honestly figure out what the adult content articles are talking about especially with the pictures and videos that people like to include in these type of articles in the name of understanding the topic?
My gripe is the articles in this project that are not content appropriate for children. I just don't see the need for a simple English wikipedia for adults when this issue can be addressed by simply adding a sub-heading on a given article. ()
Well, I've been working like hell in my sandbox, and have no clue how to insert a scrollbar to deal with a hoard of Userboxes! Anyone can help me??? () 20:17, 24 December 2008 (UTC)

I've recently chucked in editing on the English Wikipedia for various reasons (that I won't bore you with right now) but I can assure you I did so for my own reasons and was not forced. I may disclose my EN account at a later stage, but I'd rather not be prejudged, in whatever way, for now.
Anyway my query is about the lack of references in articles on Simple. I want to create a number of articles in the Simple English manner, and wondered if not using references was official policy here? Thank you all, () 13:20, 25 December 2008 (UTC)

I am rtrying to get the 1606 UK flagicon, but I come up with the 1801 one. Why is this? 13:23, 27 December 2008 (UTC)
Excuse me if I stir up things a bit, but apparently nobody has effectively replied the two main objections raised against this project in the , namely,
I'm not opposed to the goals of this project: yesterday I was trying to find info for a homework for my second grade niece (on rubber for more information), and found that the "Standard" English was way above her understanding level, and the article on this project was vague, incomplete, and still not quite "simple".-- I'm willing to cooperate, but at this stage of development the name "simple" is misleading (it is not a language), and I have no clue about how to fix the article in question without clear criteria about what is "simple". I also tried to add an article on controlled languages, and found out that someone tried to make it "simple", but without any clear idea about how to do that. To me this seems to be a matter of taste, and taste is a bad standard.--- Slightly annoyed, () 20:48, 11 December 2008 (UTC)
(<-) Perhaps very simply put: 
I have an idea: I'm setting up a WikiProject so that discussion may take place . Just follow the rabbit! () 17:20, 27 December 2008 (UTC)
Let me take that back. I'll put it very simply before going any further. The vocabulary for an encyclopaedia can't be smaller than 3000 words, given the wide range of topics to cover. Online tools to check readability may also help. So, based on the current tools, I'd say that the standards may be the following: () 18:52, 27 December 2008 (UTC)
If you mix these three dictionaries you get a root vocabulary of about 3000 root words. () 18:52, 27 December 2008 (UTC)
This root dictionary may be completed with other word lists to guarantee that the articles look familiar to readers. These lists may be Dolch's 300 words for younger readers, Fry's 1000 Instant Words, and the first 1000 words from the General Service List. The total count of mixing these lists is around 1500. However, many of them are already counted in the 3000 words from the previous lists. () 18:52, 27 December 2008 (UTC)
Taking Dolch's and Fry's rule that one grade is equal to 100 words, the reading level is that of a Middle School graduate (10th grade). So the target audience may be either Middle School students (7th-10th grade), adults within that range (the average reading level in the U.S.A. is 7th grade), or ESL students in that level (advanced intermediate).

Oil tanker

An oil tanker, also known as a petroleum tanker, is a ship made for the bulk transport of oil. There are two basic types of oil tankers: the crude tanker and the product tanker. Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries. Product tankers, generally much smaller, are designed to move petrochemicals from refineries to points near consuming markets.

<doc id="148328" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=148328" title="Duat">
Duat

is the Egyptian idea of the underworld (also called Akert, Amenthes, or Neter-khertet). To the Egyptians, the underworld was divided into sections filled with dangers that the Egyptian Soul had to pass through. This is the same realm that Ra was believed to pass into each night and battle Apophis. The Egyptian Underworld is described in many funerary texts that are found in tombs of mummies, believed to help guide them through death.
Duat is where the famous "Weighing of the Heart" is displayed. Where the soul, shown as a heart, is weighed on the scales of Anubis against the feather of Ma'at. Ammit was believed to eat the souls of the people whose heart did not match the exact weight of Ma'at's feather. It was thought that the heart itself was then eaten by a lion. 
The Egyptian idea of the underworld influenced many other ideas of afterlife in other cultures.

<doc id="148333" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=148333" title="Ammit">
Ammit

Ammit was the Egyptian idea of the punishment of the soul. The name means "devourer" or "soul-eater."Ammit was usually known as 'The Devourer of the Dead' or the 'Eater of Hearts'. Ammit was believed to eat any souls found to have sinned. They would then be digested for eternity in acid. Or, Ammit who was believed to be the guardian of a lake of fire, would place the soul into the liquid fire for all eternity.
Ammit appears as mix of the crocodile, leopard, and hippo. Rather than being worshipped, Ammit was feared. She was not viewed as a god, but she was viewed as a good force because she destroyed evil. Although Ammit is seen as a devouring entity, she is neutral and strictly serves at the whim of the other deities to take souls that have sinned against the gods and send them into oblivion. She was known as the crocodile goddess also known as Estriedia.
Ammit was believed to be Anubis's equal but she wanted more. She wanted to enter the real world and devour the souls of the living.
Ammit also intermittently appears as Ammit the Devourer in The Kane Chronicles. In the trilogy, it was kept at bay with Anubis.

Christian rock

Christian rock is a type of rock music that is performed by Christians. It often has lyrics and themes dealing with Christianity.
Christian rock started as "Jesus music" and piano in church but has become a form of modern music that has become more popular. Some Christian rock bands such as Switchfoot and P.O.D. have become popular even with fans who are not Christians.
Some Christians do not like the idea of this type of music and think rock in any form is a work of the Devil.
Other bands in this genre include Skillet, Fireflight and Red. There are many more.

Michael Howe (bushranger)

Michael Howe (1787 ‚Äì 21 October 1818) was a famous bushranger in Tasmania, Australia. He called himself the "Lieutenant Governor of the Woods". He kept a written record of his thoughts in a book he called "The Journal of Dreams".
Howe was born in Pontefract, Yorkshire, in 1787. He joined the merchant navy at Hull. After a short while he ran away and joined the Royal Navy. He deserted (left without permission) the navy after two years. He had his own small boat and carried coal. In 1811 Howe was arrested at York and charged with highway robbery. He was sentenced to seven years in Van Diemen's Land.
Howe arrived in Hobart on October 19, 1812, on the convict ship "Indefatigable". He was sent to work for John Ingle, who had once been the Supervisor of Convicts. He was now a farmer and merchant. Howe soon escaped and went into the bush. He joined up with a large group of escaped convicts who had become bushrangers (robbers). The gang of 28 was led by John Whitehead. It included two soldiers (who had deserted) and two aboriginal women.
The bushrangers robbed a lot of houses and farms around New Norfolk. On April 25, 1815, the gang went to the house of a Mr.Carlisle. Carlisle and his friends went out to stop the gang from stealing a boat. Carlisle was shot dead, and his neighbour, Mr.O'Birne, was badly wounded. O'Birne died a few days later. The gang returned to New Norfolk in May 1815, to rob more houses. They met a group of soldiers and John Whitehead was shot and killed. To claim a reward for killing a bushranger, the body had to be identified. To stop people from claiming a reward for their capture, Howe and Whitehead had made a promise to each other. This would be to cut the head off whoever was killed first so no one would know who it was. As soon as Whitehead was shot, his head was cut off by Howe and hidden in the bush.
After Whitehead's death, Howe became leader of the gang of bushrangers. He set up the gang as if they were on board a ship. Gang members could be punished if they broke the gang's rules. Punishment included having to cut and carry firewood, and even included being lashed (whipped). Howe would read to them from the Bible. He wrote letters to Governor Davey. In 1816 he signed the letters as "Lieutentant Governor of the Woods." In 1817 he began calling himself the "Governor of the Ranges." He was living with an aboriginal woman, called "Black Mary." Members of the gang were known to be James Garry, Peter Septon, George Jones, Richard Colier, John Chapman, Thomas Coyne, James Parker, Mathew Kegan, John Brown and Nenis Curry. The gang continued to rob people at Green Point, Coal River, and Bagdad.
In 1817, Howe wrote to Governor William Sorell and offered to give himself up in return for a free pardon (not be put in gaol for any crimes). He offered to tell the government where all the gang members could be found. He was put into Hobart gaol while he was being questioned about the gang. He escaped while being taken for a walk through Hobart to get fresh air. He went back and rejoined the gang. Governor Lachlan Macquarie in Sydney stopped the pardon, and told Sorell to put more effort in to capture Howe. Sorell offered money, a free pardon and a return to England for anyone that captured Howe.
The hunt for the bushrangers became more organized. John Chapman and a man called Elliot were shot dead by the soldiers in 1817. A gang member called Hillier cut Peter Septon's head off to claim a reward. He also tried to cut off Richard Colier's head. Both men were hurt in the struggle. Hillier was taken to Sydney where he was executed by hanging. Colier was executed in Hobart on March 26, 1818. In April, 1818, a group of convicts tried to steal a government boat. They were going to rescue Howe and take him to America. John Brown, James Parker, Thomas Coyne and Mathew Kegan gave themselves up to the military. They were all taken to Newcastle, New South Wales where they were given the lash (whipped) and sent to gaol.
In September 1818, a group came from Sydney to join in the hunt for Howe. They wanted the reward. One member of the group was the famous aboriginal tracker, Mosquito. They nearly caught him. They did get his guns and his knapsack (a backpack). In the knapsack they found his "Journal of Dreams". It was a book made from kangaroo skin and Howe had written in it using kangaroo blood as ink. In it Howe wrote about his fear of being killed by the aborigines, his dreams of his sister, and lists of vegetables and flowers he would grow in a house in the forest. As he escaped, Howe thought Black Mary was slowing him down, so he tried to shoot her. 
On October 10, Howe was captured by two people he knew and trusted, Watts and Drewe. He managed to untie himself and stabbed Watts and shot Drewe dead. Watts died later from the injuries. On October 21, 1818, Black Mary led another two men, a convict, Thomas Worrall, and a soldier, William Pugh, to where Howe was hiding near the Shannon River. Worrall had been a sailor who had been sent to Van Diemen's Land for his part in the naval mutiny at the Nore (mouth of the Thames) in 1797. He wanted the reward so he could be free and return to England. All the men shot at each other, but after a fierce fight, Pugh and Worrall bashed Howe to death with their muskets (guns).
Howe was buried by the river, but his head was taken back to Hobart where it was put on public display.
Much of the information comes from a book by Governor Sorell's secretary, Thomas Wells. The book was called "Michael Howe, the Last and Worst of the Bushrangers of Van Diemen's Land" and printed in 1818 in Hobart. This was the first work of general literature printed in Australia.
