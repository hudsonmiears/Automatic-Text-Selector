Turmeric

Turmeric ("Curcuma longa") is a spice, widely used in Asian cooking. It is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plant, in the ginger family, Zingiberaceae.
Turmeric plants are widely grown in tropical areas of India, where over 70,000 acres are cultivated every year. The plant has long leaves, surrounding spikes where small flowers form. However the root, or ‘rhizome’ of the turmeric plant is harvested, in much the same way as ginger. The turmeric rhizome takes about 10 months to grow before it can be harvested; it is then boiled, cleaned and dried in the sun. Most of the harvested turmeric is ground up and sold in jars for use in cooking, however the fresh root turmeric can also be used. 
Turmeric is one of the main ingredients of curry powder, and is used to give it the characteristic yellow colour. It is also delicious added to rice dishes, seafood, and mustards and pickles. 
Turmeric is also more widely used as a colourant for textiles and food products. It is sometimes substituted for saffron as it is much less expensive, but produces the same yellow colour. Turmeric has also been used as an alternative to medicine and can be made into a drink to treat colds and stomach complaints. Faulty genes are responsible for causing cystic fibrosis. A regular intake of turmeric can be helpful in treating a patient afflicted with this condition.

Peter Bakovic

Peter Bakovic (born January 31, 1965 in Thunder Bay, Ontario) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey left wing who played briefly in the National Hockey League in the late 1980s for the Vancouver Canucks.
Bakovic played his junior hockey for the Windsor Spitfires of the Ontario Hockey League but was never drafted. After a strong final year of junior, he was signed as a free agent by the Calgary Flames in 1985. A tough player who fought often, Bakovic spent three seasons playing minor pro in the Flames' system without seeing an NHL game. In two years with the Moncton Golden Flames of the AHL, he lead the team in penalty minutes both years, but also posted good offensive totals, notching 54 and 51 points. In his only year with the Salt Lake Golden Eagles, Bakovic posted 43 points in 39 games along with 221 PIM.
Late in the 1987–88 season, he was dealt to the Vancouver Canucks. Vancouver immediately promoted him to their NHL team, and he played 10 games for the Canucks, recording 2 goals and 48 PIM. However, injuries struck the next year and he found himself back in the IHL with the Milwaukee Admirals. Bakovic would play three more seasons in Milwaukee without seeing another NHL game before retiring in 1991.
Following his retirement, Bakovic stayed in Milwaukee and remained with the Admirals organization as an assistant coach until 1998. He continues to live in Milwaukee and coaches high school hockey.

William James

William James (1842–1910) was an American psychologist and philosopher. He was an original thinker in physiology, psychology and philosophy. His major work was a twelve-hundred page book which gave us such ideas as the "stream of thought". William was the brother of the novelist Henry James.
James was a pragmatist. He defined true beliefs as those that prove useful to the believer. Truth is verifiable (can be tested) when thoughts and statements correspond with actual things, and also "hang together," or cohere, as pieces of a puzzle might fit together. These 'truths' are confirmed by the observed results putting them into practice.
James held a world view in line with pragmatism, declaring that the value of any truth depended on its use to the person who held it. The world is a mosaic of diverse experiences that can only be understood through "radical empiricism". Radical empiricism, not related to the everyday scientific empiricism, asserts that the world and experience can never be halted for an entirely objective analysis. The mind of the observer and simple act of observation will affect the outcome of any empirical approach to truth. The mind, its experiences and nature, cannot be separated. James's emphasis on diversity as the default human condition has kept a strong influence in American culture, especially among liberals. James's description of the mind-world connection, which he described as a "stream of consciousness", had a direct and significant effect on avant-garde and modernist literature and art.
In "What pragmatism means", James writes that the central point of his own doctrine of truth is, in brief, that "Truths emerge from facts, but they dip forward into facts again and add to them; which facts again create or reveal new truth (the word is indifferent) and so on indefinitely. The 'facts' themselves meanwhile are not true. They simply "are"</u/l>. Truth is the function of the beliefs that start and terminate among them".

<doc id="262302" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=262302" title="V6 engine">
V6 engine

A V6 engine, often just called a V6, is an internal combustion engine with six cylinders. The engine has three cylinders on each side called banks. The two banks form a "V" shaped angle. In most engines, the two banks are at a right angle (90°) or less to each other. All six pistons turn a common crankshaft. It is the second most common engine design in modern cars after the inline four. It can be powered by different types of fuels, including gasoline, diesel, natural gas and alcohol.
The V6 is a very compact engine design. It is shorter than the straight-4. Many V6 engines are narrower than the V8 engine. They work well and are well suited to the popular transverse engine front-wheel drive cars. It has largely replaced the inline-6, which is too long to fit in many modern cars. It is more complicated and not as smooth as the inline-6. The V6 is more compact, more rigid, and less prone to vibrations. It is also becoming a high performance engine. It has high power and torque output like the classic V8, but has good fuel economy.
Some of the first V6-cars were built in 1905 by the Marmon Motor Car Company.
The first series production V6 was introduced by Lancia in 1950. Other builders soon started using V6 engines. In 1959, General Motors built a heavy-duty 305 in (5 L) 60° V6 for use in their pickup trucks and Chevrolet Suburban. The engine was later enlarged to 478 in (7.8 L) for heavy truck and bus use.
In 1962, the Buick Special offered a 90° V6 with uneven firing intervals. Consumers did not like this engine because of the vibration. 
Due to the odd number of cylinders in each bank, V6 designs are unbalanced, whatever V-angle they use. Each bank in a V6 has an odd number of pistons. The V6 has an end-to-end rocking motion. Counterweights on the crankshaft and a counter rotating balancer shaft compensate for some of the rocking motion. 
The Lancia V6 in 1950 used a 60° angle between the cylinder banks and a six-throw crankshaft, to achieve equally spaced firing intervals of 120°. This still has some balance and secondary vibration problems. The first Buick V6 was a 90°, based on their 90° V8. This produced a rough-running design. This was unacceptable to many customers. Later designs have improved the engine and made it reasonably smooth.
The most efficient cylinder bank angle for a V6 is 60 degrees. This makes the smallest size engine and reduces vibration. 60° V6 engines are not as well balanced. Modern design has reduced most of the vibration. 60 degree V6 engines do not need balance shafts. This design works well in larger cars where four-cylinder engines do not have enough power.
Some 90° V6 engines are built. They are usually based on V8 engines. It takes little work to change a V8 into a V6 engine. The problem is these engines are wider and have more vibration than a 60° V6. More modern 90° V6 engine designs avoid vibration problems by changing the crankshaft's design and firing timing. Balancing shafts are often used to remove the remaining vibration. 
120° could be thought of as the "natural" angle for a V6. Each cylinder fires a power stroke every 120° of crankshaft rotation. This allows pairs of pistons to share crank pins (a connection on the crankshaft). Unlike the V8, there is no way to arrange a V6 to balance the piston forces. Because of the odd number of cylinders in each bank, a balance shaft is needed.
The 120° design also creates a very wide engine. It is too wide for most cars. It is often used in race cars. Race cars are designed around the engine, and vibration is not as important. The flat-6 "boxer" engine (180°) is only slightly wider than the 120° V6, and it is fully balanced.
When the fuel in a cylinder is burned, it pushes the piston down and creates power. This is often referred to as "firing". 
Many early V6 engines were based on V8 engine designs. This made a firing pattern with groups of two cylinders with an "odd-firing" order. This resulting in rough-running engines with unpleasant vibrations at certain engine speeds.
More modern 90° V6 engines avoid this problem. They use a split crank pin where the piston connects to the crankshaft. This makes an even 120° firing pattern. A 'split' crank pin is weaker than a straight one. Modern metallurgical techniques can produce a crankshaft that is strong enough to not break.
The V6 engine was introduced into racing by Lancia in the early 1950s. They had some good results. Then Ferrari built the Dino V6. Alfredo Ferrari, the son of Enzo Ferrari, was nicknamed Dino. He suggested building a 1.5 litre V6 engine for Formula Two racing. The Dino V6 was updated several times, and increased to a 2.4 litre engine. The Dino V6 was used in the Ferrari 246 Formula One car in 1958.
Laverda showed a 996 cc V6-engined motorcycle at the 1977 Milan show. The motorcycle was raced in the 1978 Bol d'Or 24 hour race.

The notochord is a flexible, rod-shaped body found in embryos of all chordates. It forms the axis of the embryo. In some chordates, it persists throughout life as the main support down the length of the body. In most vertebrates it is replaced by the vertebral column. The notochord is found ventral (underneath) the neural tube (future spinal cord). 
Notochords were the first "backbones" in chordates. Notochords were advantageous to primitive fish-ancestors: they were a rigid structure for muscle attachment, but flexible enough to allow movement. Embryos of vertebrates have notochords, and develop the vertebral column later.

Hamish MacCunn (22 March 1868 – 2 August 1916), was a Scottish composer and conductor who lived in the later part of the romantic period.
He was born in Greenock. His father was a shipowner. He soon showed a great talent for music. In 1883 he got a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Music, which had only just been founded. His teachers there included Sir Hubert Parry and Sir Charles Villiers Stanford. 
MacCunn became a professor of harmony at the Royal Academy of Music from 1888-1894. He also taught at the Guildhall School of Music.
MacCunn composed several orchestral works as well as operas, but he had to spend more and more time conducting in order to earn money. For a time he conducted the Carl Rosa Opera Company. He conducted Wagner’s opera "Siegfried " and the first performance in English " of "Tristan and Isolde".
In 1887 he conducted his overture "The Land of the Mountain and the Flood" at the Crystal Palace. This was a very successful piece, and it remains the only composition of his which is still often performed. The music has a Scottish feeling and sounds quite similar to the music of Mendelssohn. Although he composed other pieces which were similar in mood, none of them were as successful as this one.
In 1888, he married Alison Pettie, daughter of the painter John Pettie who had painted MacCunn's portrait several times. They had one son. John Pettie liked music and helped MacCunn in his career by organizing concerts of his music.
He died aged only 48.

Transverse engine

A transverse engine is an engine mounted in a vehicle so that the engine's crankshaft is at a right angle (90°) to the vehicle. Many modern front wheel drive vehicles use a transverse engine mounting design. The majority of rear wheel drive vehicles use a longitudinal engine design, where the engine's crankshaft axis is parallel to the vehicle.
The first car known to use such an arrangement was a 1911 front-wheel drive car. It had a clutch at each end of the engine, driving the front wheels directly. The first successful transverse-engine cars were the two-cylinder DKW "Front" series of cars. These first appeared in 1931. After the World War II, SAAB used the configuration in their first model, the Saab 92, in 1947.
Engines may be placed in two main positions within the motor car:

Dimethylmercury

Dimethylmercury, sometimes called dimethyl mercury, is a chemical compound. It contains methyl and mercury ions. Its chemical formula is (CH)Hg. 
It is a colorless liquid. It evaporates very fast. It is a very strong toxin to the nervous system. It doesn't react with water like other similar chemicals. It contains mercury in its +2 oxidation state. It can react with mercury(II) chloride to make a crystalline chemical compound.
It is made by reacting a sodium amalgam with methyl iodide. 
It has almost no uses. It is rarely used to test instruments that are used to detect mercury.
It is extremely toxic. If just a drip gets placed on human skin, it will poison the person. It gets into the brain easily when it goes through the skin. The poisoning does not happen quickly, though. It sometimes can take months before the poisoning effects show.

Inception

Inception is a 2010 American science fiction action heist movie written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine. DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a thief who collects information from the subconscious mind of his victims while they dream. Cobb has two children but cannot visit them. He is offered a chance to go back to his children in exchange for one last job: performing "inception", which is planting a new idea, into the mind of his client's main business competitor. 
The idea behind "Inception" was first developed over nine years before it was released. In 2001, Nolan wrote an 80-page treatment about dream-stealers, presenting the idea to Warner Bros. At first the story was written as a heist movie, based on ideas of lucid dreaming and dream incubation. 
Because Nolan wanted to have more experience working with big-scale movies, he chose to work on "Batman Begins", "The Prestige" and "The Dark Knight". He spent six months polishing up the script for "Inception" before Warner Bros. purchased it in February 2009. Filming spanned six countries and four continents, beginning in Tokyo on June 19, 2009 and finishing in Canada in late November of the same year. Composer Hans Zimmer wrote the music for the movie. 
"Inception" was officially budgeted at $160 million, a cost which was shared between Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures. Nolan's success with "The Dark Knight" helped gain the movie $100 million to spend on advertising. "Inception" was first screened in London on July 8, 2010 and was shown in standard and IMAX theatres on July 14, 2010. The movie had a lot of positive reviews and earned over $21 million on its opening day, and $62.7 million in the first weekend.

Methyl iodide

Methyl iodide is a chemical compound. It is made of methyl and iodide ions. Its chemical formula is CHI.
It is a liquid that evaporates easily. When it is exposed to light, it turns purple because of iodine. This can be stopped by keeping it with copper. It breaks down when heated to make carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen iodide. 
It is made by reacting iodine, red phosphorus, and methanol all at the same time. Phosphorus(III) iodide is formed during the reaction. Another way to make it is to react methanol with potassium iodide and some sulfuric acid. 
It is used to add methyl to some organic compounds. It can also be used as a pesticide. It is used to make dimethylmercury and other chemicals.
It causes nausea and dizziness when breathed. It can cause burns when put on skin.

Phosphorus(III) iodide

Phosphorus(III) iodide, also known as phosphorus triiodide, is a chemical compound. It is made of phosphorus and iodide ions. It contains phosphorus in its +3 oxidation state. Its chemical formula is PI.
It is a red solid. It is very unstable and a powerful reducing agent. It reacts violently with water. The reaction with water makes phosphorous acid and hydrogen iodide. It is used in making chemicals. Some think that it is too unstable to be stored, but it can be stored and can be bought. 
Phosphorus(III) iodide is made by reacting iodine with white phosphorus dissolved in carbon disulfide. It is dissolved in carbon disulfide because it does not dissolve in water. It can also be made by reacting phosphorus(III) chloride with hydrogen iodide or some other iodide.
It reacts with alcohols such as methanol to make "alkyl iodides" such as methyl iodide. Many times phosphorus(III) iodide is made in the reaction. The alkyl iodides are used in many chemical reactions.

Carbon disulfide

Carbon disulfide, also known as carbon bisulfide, is a chemical compound. It consists of carbon and sulfide ions. It contains carbon in its +4 oxidation state and sulfur in its -2 oxidation state. Its chemical formula is CS.
It is similar to carbon dioxide, although much more reactive. Sulfide is a much more powerful reducing agent than oxide. It burns very easily and catches fire at 90°C. It smells sweet but is often contaminated other chemicals that smell bad. 
It used to be made by reacting carbon and sulfur at a very high temperature. Now it is made by "burning" methane in sulfur (instead of oxygen). It is much harder to burn methane in sulfur. The waste product (carbon disulfide) is also much more reactive than carbon dioxide, the normal waste product.
It is used to make carbon tetrachloride. It is also used in making organic chemicals. It is used to dissolve things like phosphorus and iodine and to kill insects. 
Carbon disulfide is very flammable and is also toxic in large amounts when breathed in.

Chemiluminescence

Chemiluminescence (or Chemoluminescence) is a kind of luminescence. It is a process of making light from a chemical reaction. Chemiluminescence in biological systems is called bioluminescence. 
The light made in chemiluminiscence is not directly related to heat. A simple two step example of a reaction of A, and B, that produces; C, D, and light.
C</sub> is an excited state of C. 
This reaction is simpler than most chemiluminesence reactions. The excited state happens when electrons are pushed into a higher orbit by the energy of a chemical reaction. The excited state is less stable than the ground state. The electrons in the excited state fall to the ground state (lower energy), emitting light. 
The amount of measurable light made is called "radiant intensity": I(calcium) inside of different parts of cells like the mitochondria can make light when it reacts with a protein from jellyfish named aequorin. Nitric oxide(NO) is in cells and is a way for cells to talk to each other, this can be measured with the compound luminol.

Thilo Sarrazin

Thilo Sarrazin (born 12 February 1945) is a German economist and former politician of the SPD. In 2000 and 2001, Sarrazin worked for the "Deutsche Bahn". In 2002, he became the senator for finance in the German state of Berlin. In May 2009, he became member of the executive board of the "Deutsche Bundesbank".
Sarrazin published the book "Deutschland schafft sich ab" ("Germany Abolishes Itself") with controversial comments about the German immigration system. The book was published on 30 August 2010. His book led the executive board members of the Bundesbank to ask to dismiss Thilo Sarrazin from his office. This must be done by the German "Bundespräsident" Christian Wulff. After an agreement with the "German Bundesbank", Thilo Sarrazin will leave his post at the end of September.
Sarrazin is also known for statements such as the following:
Sarrazin was born in Gera, Germany. His father was a doctor and the mother a daughter of a West Prussian landowner. His paternal family, a French Huguenot family, is originally from Burgundy. His grandmother was English-Italian. He has explained that his name means Saracen (i.e. Muslim) and is common in Southern France. It comes from the Arab pirates that were called “Saracens” in the Middle Ages. His mother has a Polish origin. He has referred to himself as "a European mongrel".
He grew up in Recklinghausen. At age seven, he went to an orphanage in Bavaria. He graduated from the local gymnasium and then served in the military from 1967 to 1971. Then, he studied Economics at the University of Bonn, earning his doctorate. From November 1973 to December 1974 he worked for the Friedrich Ebert Foundation and became active in the SPD.
In 1975 Sarrazin started to work in the Federal Ministry of Finance. Until 1981 he served as Head of Unit in the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. In 1981, he returned to the Federal Ministry of Finance. In October 1981, he started to work as bureau chief and was a close collaborator of Federal Finance Minister Hans Matthöfer and his successor Manfred Lahnstein. Even after the end of the socialist-liberal coalition in October 1982, Sarrazin remained in the Finance Ministry. There he was director of several units, including (from 1989 to 1990) the "Innerdeutsche Beziehungen", which the German monetary, economic and social union prepared. During his time as Head of the Federal Ministry of Finance, he was partly responsible for German railways.
From 1990 to 1991, Sarrazin worked for the Treuhand. Then he was up to 1997 State Secretary in the Ministry of Finance in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Sarrazin is married to Ursula Sarrazin ("née" Breit) and has two sons.

The Turn of the Screw (opera)

The Turn of the Screw is an opera by Benjamin Britten. It is a chamber opera (an opera for a small number of characters and very small orchestra). The story is based on a story with the same title by Henry James. The libretto (the words of the opera) were written by Myfanwy Piper. The story of the opera is almost exactly the same as in Henry James’s book. Britten was asked by the Venice Biennale to write the opera. It was first performed on 14 September, 1954, at the Teatro La Fenice, Venice. Its first performance in Britain took place a month later on 6 October 1954 at Sadler’s Wells Opera in London.
The opera is divided into two acts. It is further divided into a prologue and sixteen scenes. Before each scene starts we hear a variation on the 'Screw' theme. This theme is based on twelve notes which are all the 12 notes in the octave. This is called twelve-tone row, but it is tonally based (the music is in traditional keys, unlike the music of Schoenberg). There are only 13 players in the orchestra.
The prologue is just for a solo singer (tenor) and piano. He tells us about a young governess he once knew who looked after two children at Bly House. The children’s parents were dead, and they were supposed to be cared for by their uncle. The uncle, who lived in London, was far too busy to care for them, and he hired a governess for them. He told the governess (who is just called “the governess” in the opera) that she must never write to him about the children. She must make any decisions about them herself. She must never ask him about the history of Bly House, and she must always continue to care for the children.
The Governess wonders what the children will be like. The children wonder what their new governess will be like. When the Governess arrives at Bly House she is greeted by the housekeeper, Mrs. Grose, and the children who (bow and curtsey). She thinks that the boy, Miles, looks strangely familiar. Miles goes to a boarding school, but he has come home for the holidays. A letter from his school arrives saying that he has been expelled because he had been threatening other children. The Governess is sure that Miles, like his sister Flora, is too kind and innocent to have done such terrible things. Mrs Grose also thinks the same thing. The Governess decides not to take any notice of the letter.
The Governess sings about her wonderful position at the house and the beautiful children she has in her care. But at night she hears strange footsteps and a cry outside her door. Suddenly, she sees a pale-faced man sitting on a tower of the house. When the man disappears, she becomes frightened and wonders if she has seen a ghost. But then she is comforted when she hears the children singing the nursery rhyme "Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son". The Governess doubts that she saw anything, but decides to tell Mrs. Grose. The housekeeper tells the Governess about Peter Quint, who used to be a servant at Bly House. What Mrs. Grose says seems to suggest that Quint had done nasty things to Miles. At that time Miles had a governess called Miss Jessel. Mrs. Grose suggests that Quint had a sexual relationship with Miss Jessell, and that they both had sexual relations with the children. The housekeeper said she could do nothing about it, as Quint cleverly found any letters that came for her and he threatened her with physical harm. But when Miss Jessel became pregnant and people found out how bad she was, she abandoned the children and ran away. Soon afterwards she died. Shortly after that Quint died a mysterious death on an icy road near Bly House. 
The next morning, the Governess is teaching Miles Latin when he goes into a trance-like state and sings a song which shows that Quint had abused him.
Later that day, the Governess sits by the side of a lake with Flora. Flora names the seas of the world, finishing with the Dead Sea. Flora compares the Dead Sea (where nothing can live) to Bly House. This worries the Governess. As Flora plays on the shore with her doll, the Governess suddenly sees a strange woman across the lake who seems to be watching Flora. It is the ghost of Miss Jessel, who has returned to get Flora. The Governess hurries Flora home to safety.
That night, Miles and Flora slip out into the woods to meet Miss Jessel and Peter Quint. The children fantasize about a world where dreams come true. The Governess and Mrs. Grose arrive as the children are about to be possessed, and the spirits depart. Miles sings a song about how he has been a bad boy.
The ghosts of Peter Quint and Miss Jessel reappear. They argue about who harmed whom first when they were alive, and accuse one another of not acting quickly enough to possess the children. In her room, the Governess worries about the evil she feels in the house.
The next morning, the family goes to church. The children sing a song which sounds like a song praising God. Mrs. Grose does not realize the meaning of the song until the Governess tells her they are singing about horrors. The Governess runs off and goes to her room. She can feel the presence of Miss Jessel and sees her sitting at her desk. The Governess now knows that she cannot abandon the children. She writes to the children’s uncles saying that she must see him. 
When the Governess asks Miles what happened at school Quint’s voice is heard. Miles shrieks and the candle goes out. Miles is tempted by Quint to pick up the letter. He steals it and rushes off. Miles distracts the grown-up’s attention by playing the piano, so they do not notice Flora going off to the lake. Mrs Grose and the Governess find Flora by the lake. The Governess tries to make Flora say that she can see Mrs Jessel, but she shouts that she can’t see anybody. Mrs Grose takes her home. 
In the last scene Flora has become mad. Mrs Grose tells the Governess that her letter to the uncle must have been stolen. She asks Miles whether he stole it. He denies it, but all the time he can see Peter Quint who is telling him he must not tell them the truth about him. In the end Miles screams: “Peter Quint! You devil!” and then dies. The Governess is left holding the dead boy in her arms.
The instruments used in the orchestra are: 2 violins, viola, cello, double bass, flute/alto flute/piccolo, harp, oboe/cor anglais, piano, celesta and percussion.

Cosworth

Cosworth is a high performance engineering company. It was founded in London in 1958. It builds engines and electronics for automobile racing, mainstream automotive and defence industries. Cosworth is based in Northampton, England. It has North American facilities in Torrance, California; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Mooresville, North Carolina. It also has a facility in Pune, India.
Cosworth has had a long and well respected career in Formula One, beginning in 1963. Cosworth stepped away from Formula One for three years when no team decided to use their engines for . Cosworth returned to F1 in , suppling engines to Williams, HST, Lotus, and Virgin. The first Formula One engines shipped in January. Cosworth's 176 wins make it the second most successful engine manufacturers in F1, after Ferrari.
The company was founded as a British racing internal combustion engine maker in 1958 by Mike Costin and Keith Duckworth (1933-2005) The name Cosworth came by combining their last names. (COStin and duckWORTH). Even thought it was an independent company, it was supported by the Ford Motor Company for many years. Most of the Cosworth engines were named Ford engines.
The company went through a several ownership changes. The business was growing. Keith Duckworth did not want to run the day-to-day business.
Cosworth was sold to United Engineering Industries (UEI) in 1980. Duckworth remained as president for life, and technical involvement with Cosworth. He became a UEI board director. UEI was a group of small to medium-sized technology companies.
UEI was taken over by Carlton Communications in 1988. Carlton wanted some of the audio-visual companies that were part of UEI. Cosworth was a poor fit, so Carlton sold the Cosworth part off.
In 1990, Cosworth was sold to Vickers, a British engineering company.
In 1998, Cosworth was sold to Audi, which is a part of Volkswagen. Hours later, Audi sold the Cosworth Racing division to Ford.
In September, 2004 Ford announced that it was selling Cosworth, along with Cosworth Racing Ltd and its Jaguar Formula One team. On 15 November 2004, the sale of Cosworth was completed to Champ Car World Series owners Gerald Forsythe and Kevin Kalkhoven They are the current owners of the Cosworth Group.
The road car engine division of Cosworth was renamed Cosworth Technology. It was sold to MAHLE in 2005. Cosworth Technology was then renamed as MAHLE Powertrain on 1 July 2005.
Cosworth has had a long relationship with the Ford Motor Company. This started when Cosworth started building racing engines in 1959. These engines were modified versions of the Inline-four Ford Kent engine for Formula Junior. Cosworth built a engine for the Lotus 7. and engines were built use in Formula B, sports car racing, and the Lotus Cortina. The final version of the Cosworth-Kent, in 1965, was the MAE. It was used in Formula 3 when engines were allowed. This was the dominate engine.
The Cortina engine was also the basis for the FVA, a Formula Two engine introduced in 1966. This engine featured dual overhead camshafts with 16 valves. It produced at least at 9000 rpm. This engine dominated the category until 1971. It was also used in sports car racing as the FVC. The FVA was part of the same Ford contract that gave rise to the DFV.
A larger engine was built for endurance racing in the mid 1970s. The FVC displaced . The FVC produced only .
In 1966, Colin Chapman of Lotus Cars was the founder and principal of Team Lotus. He got Ford to finance Keith Duckworth's design for a new lightweight 3.0 litre Formula One engine. Cosworth received the order along with £100,000 from Ford. The contract told Duckworth to build a four-cylinder Ford-based F2 engine to prove it would work (see the FVA above). After that, a pure Cosworth V8 would be built. The DFV design used a similar cylinder head to the one on the FVA engine with custom cylinder block and crankcase. This created the legendary DFV - literally meaning "Double Four Valve". This engine, and its version were used for a quarter of a century. It was the most successful engine in the history of Formula One / Grand Prix motor racing. With 167 winning races it put Cosworth Engineering on the map. Although designed for Formula One, the engine has been modified for use in many other areas.
The DFV won on its first outing, at the 1967 Dutch Grand Prix. Jim Clark drove a Lotus 49 with the DFV engine. Starting in 1968, any F1 team could purchase the engine. During the 1970s, it was common for almost the entire field to use one of the DFV engines. Ferrari never used a Cosworth engine. Most teams just built a car around a Cosworth DFV and a Hewland gearbox. It won a record 155 World Championship races. The last was the Detroit Grand Prix in 1983 in a Tyrrell driven by Michele Alboreto.
The DFV with 410 horsepower did not produce as much power as some of its rival 12-cylinder engines. It was lighter, resulting in a better power to weight ratio. It was also a structural part of the car.
The DFY, introduced in 1982 was upgrade of the DFV for Formula One with 520 horsepower. While it produced more power, it no match for the turbocharged cars of the day. It was the advent of turbocharged engines which ended the use of the DFY. In 1986 Cosworth returned to the lower levels of racing. They modified the DFV for the newly created Formula 3000. The DFV remained in F3000 until 1992.
In Formula One, a new DFV-based design was introduced for the new rules in . 3.5 litre normally-aspirated (non-turbocharded) engines were allowed. In 1988 Cosworth built the DFR, which was used in F1 by the smaller teams until 1991. It scored its last points in 1990.
The DFV is still being used in Classic F1 racing. The FIA given them World Championship status in 2004.
One of the most successful and longest-lived projects of Cosworth has been its CART / Champ Car engine program. In 1975, Cosworth developed the DFX engine. A turbocharged 2.65 litre engine, the DFX became the standard engine to run in IndyCar racing. It ending the reign of the Offenhauser, and maintaining that position until the late 1980s.
While designed as an F1 engine, the DFV was also used as in endurance racing. Its design led to vibrations putting stress on devices surrounding the engine. It was hard on the exhaust system. The first sports car to use a DFV failed to finish a single race because of repeated breakdowns. The DFV did win the 24 hours of Le Mans twice in its original 3.0 litre form. A special endurance version, the DFL, was then developed. The 3.3 litre was reliable. The 4.0 litre was largely remembered as a failure.
A variant of the Ford Essex engine was developed for the Ford Capris. The Capris were raced in Group 2 in the early 1970s. This engine had a displacement of 3.4 L. The GA was also used in the last few years of Formula 5000 in Europe.
The FBA and FBC engines were found in the Ford Granada and Ford Scorpio Ultima. The FBA came first in 1991, and was also known as the 'BOA'. It was based on the Ford Cologne V6. It was a twin overhead camshaft with 24 valves, and produced 192 horsepower. In was updated 1995 to produce 201 horsepower. This engine was known as the 'BOB'.
A racing version was also available for a short time. The FBE had with individual throttle butterflies for each cylinder. The FBB and FBD engines were developed but never released.
Cosworth increased its work with Ford in 1969. Cosworth developed a double overhead camshaft (DOHC) 16-valve inline four cylinder engine for road use in the European Ford Escort. Working from the Kent block, Cosworth created a 1.6 Litre engine for homologation (standarding) purposes. The camshafts were driven by a toothed timing belt. The name BDA, came from "Belt Drive, A type". Running in Group 2 and Group 4 on either rallying or touring car racing, this engine could be enlarged to 2.0 litres. The standard 1.6 L engine could be used in cars competing overall wins, not just first in class.
In 1970, the BDC version received fuel injection. In 1972, the 1.8 L BDA series was being used in Formula 2. In 1973, it went to 1.98 L as the BDG engine. The BDG also had an aluminum engine block.
Other versions of the engine were made for Formula Atlantic in 1970, and SCCA club racing and sports car racing. A 1.7 L BDR version was built in the 1980s. A 1.8 L BDT was built for the Escort RS1700T and the Ford RS2000.
A 2.14 L version was developed by Brian Hart just as Group B was canceled by the FIA. The Hart 420R owes much to the BDA series. It is basically an aluminum block version with similar cylinder heads.
In 1970, Ford asked Weslake and Co to build the BDA Engine for them, and by the end of 1970 the production line had been installed at Rye and production was under way.
The YB series of 2.0 L engines are based on the older Pinto engine block. They were introduced in the road-going Ford Sierra RS Cosworth in 1986 with 201 horsepower. Racing versions could develop about 400 horsepower. A limited edition version was introduced in 1987. The RS500 could produce 550 horsepower in full racing setup.
The YB series engine was replace in 1997, with the Zetec engine design.
Cosworth tested turbocharged BD version. They finally built an all-new turbocharged 1.5 L V6 engine. This engine was badged (named) the Ford TEC. Inside Cosworth, it was known as the GB-series. This engine had a long development history. It only raced only for a short time. In was used by the Haas Lola team in and the Benetton Formula team in .
The final replacement for the DFV/DFZ/DFR series was the 3.5 L HB V8 engine. It was used by the Benetton team midway through 1989. It won the Japanese Grand Prix that year. This engine had a narrower v-angle than the DFV.
As the works (factory supported) team, Benetton was the only team to use this model through the rest of and . In , customer units became available. The customer engines did not have all the updates the works engines did. In 1991, these engines were supplied to the new Jordan Grand Prix team. In 1992, they went to Team Lotus. 1993 saw McLaren added to the customer engine deal. McLaren won five Grands Prix with Ayrton Senna that year. A new Cosworth unit, badged as a Ford Zetec-R was built in 1994. That year, Michael Schumacher won the Drivers World Championship with Benetton. This was the last Ford powered F1 title.
A Jaguar-badged version of the HB was used for a short time in sports car racing with the Jaguar XJR-14. Cosworth also developed a 72° V10 engine for the Sauber Formula One team. It was baged as a Ford engine.
Cosworth has made several 3.0 L V10 engines for other Formula One teams. The Stewart Grand Prix team basically became the Ford works team. They used Cosworth CR-1 engines from their first season in 1997. Stewart became Jaguar Racing which became Red Bull Racing. They used Cosworth V10 engines until 2006. Minardi also used re-badged Cosworth engines until 2005.
Williams began using the new CA2006 Cosworth V8 engines for the 2006 season. In the same year, Scuderia Toro Rosso used detuned V10 engines based on the 2005 units.
In 2007, Williams and Scuderia Torro Rosso both switched to other engines. This left Cosworth out of Formula one for three years. Honda left F1 in December 2008. This led to Cosworth being selected to provide a standard engine to any interested team. Teams could purchase entire engines, or build their own from the Cosworth designs.
In 2010 Cosworth returned as the engine supplier for Williams. They also supplied three new teams; Hispania Racing, Lotus Racing and Virgin Racing. The CA2010 is the same 2.4 litre V8 base of the CA2006 used by Williams. It has been re-tuned from 20,000 rpm to the current 18,000 rpm limit required on all engines. The first engines were shipped to teams in mid-January, 2 weeks prior to first track testing for the year.
Cosworth needed to replace the DFS engines used in IndyCar and Champ Car racing. Cosworth designed the X-series, beginning in 1992 with the XB. The XF was built for the 2000 season to replace the XD. It was picked as the spec engine for the Champ Car World Series in 2003. The most recent version is the 2.65 litre XFE, used through 2007. The Champ Car World Series set a rev limit of 12,000 rpm. The 2004 model of the XFE was rated at 750 horsepower for normal running. It could produce 800 horsepower during the "Push-to-Pass" mode.
In mid 2003, Cosworth provided the 3.5L V8 XG badged as a Chevrolet Gen 4 engine to IRL IndyCar Series teams. The XG finished 2nd in its first race at Michigan on 27 July 2003. Sam Hornish, Jr. went on to win 3 races that season with the new XG. The XG was reduced in size to 3L for 2004 season. It won one race in 2005 during Chevrolet's final season in IRL.
In 2007, the Ford name was removed from the XFE engine. The Champ Car World Series merged into the Indy Racing League IndyCar Series prior to the 2008 season. Cosworth does not currently provide engines to any American open wheel racing series.
These are 300 horsepower 2.3 L inline-four engines based on the Mazda MZR engine. A detuned (reduced power) 250 horsepower version is sold to the consumer market. This version is intended for club racers. Both engines are built by Cosworth in Torrance, California.
Cosworth is best known in Europe for its relationship with Ford. Cosworth is in the vehicle name on the high performance Ford Sierra RS Cosworth and Ford Escort RS Cosworth.
In the United States, Cosworth has also appeared in the name of a road car, the Chevrolet Vega. Only 3,508 1975 and 1976 Cosworth Vegas were built. The engine featured the Vega sleeveless, aluminum-alloy block fitted with forged components. The twin-cam, 16 valve, aluminum cylinder head design was assisted by Cosworth. The engine featured electronic ignition, electronic fuel injection, and stainless steel headers. The final US version produced 110 bhp. Cosworth's EA racing version was not successful due to engine block structural failures. Projected sales of the Cosworth Vega had been 5,000. The 1500 unused hand-built Cosworth Vega engines were simply scrapped for lack of demand.
Cosworth became involved with Mercedes-Benz in the mid-1980s. Mercedes-Benz wanted to create a Group B rally car. They turned to Cosworth to development the engine.
Mercedes wanted a 320 bhp engine based on the 136 bhp Mercedes M102 2.3 litre 4-cylinder engine. The task was given to Mike Hall, who design the famed DFV and BDA engines. Designed around the existing M102 engine, its valves set a 45° angle, rather than the 40° of the BDA. The valves were the biggest that could be fitted into the combustion chamber. Flat top pistons gave a 10.5:1 compression ratio. The new Cosworth WAA engine also was Cosworth’s first one-piece head. The camshaft carrier was cast with the head itself.
Cosworth tried to design a full Formula One Grand Prix car in 1969. The car was designed by Robin Herd. It used a new design of a 4WD transmission designed by Keith Duckworth. This transmission was different from the Ferguson transmission used by all other 4WD F1 cars of the 1960s. It was powered by a version of the DFV engine built out of magnesium. The plan was to drive the car at the British Grand Prix. Cosworth withdrew the car without any explanation. Herd left Cosworth to form March Engineering. The F1 car project was canceled. The external design of the car was Herd's use of Mallite sheeting. Mallite is a product made from layers of wood and aluminum. The Mallite was for the main structural monocoque (car body) sections. This is a procedure he developed on the first McLaren single-seat race cars, including the McLaren M2B of 1966.

Carbon tetrachloride

Carbon tetrachloride, also known as carbon tet or Freon 10, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CCl. It contains carbon in its +4 oxidation state and chloride ions.
It is a colorless liquid. It smells like ether. It evaporates quite quickly. It can dissolve fats and oils as well as other stuff such as iodine. It doesn't burn, but it does make phosgene when heated to a high temperature. 
It is made by reacting methane with chlorine. This reaction is similar to the burning of methane (reaction of methane with oxygen). Hydrogen chloride is a byproduct (left over substance). It used to be made by reacting carbon disulfide with chlorine. This reaction would produce sulfur(I) chloride. 
The uses of carbon tetrachloride have diminished lately because it is known to be damage people's health. People think it might damage the ozone layer. Today, it is rarely used for anything.
Previously, was used in fire extinguishers. It was also used to make freon, used in dry cleaning and as a refrigerant.
Carbon tetrachloride is very poisonous to the liver, the kidneys and the nervous system; it might also cause cancer.

Freon

Freon is a word for chemical refrigerants. Thomas Midgley, Jr. invented using Freon as a refrigerant. "Freon" is a registered trademark of DuPont. Freon was first used to describe chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerants, but it is now used to describe almost any kind of refrigerant. Refrigerants may contain carbon, chlorine, fluorine and sometimes bromine. For example, Freon 10 is carbon tetrachloride. Many kinds of freon are not toxic to animals. They also are cheap and work well. However, most refrigerants can reduce the amount of ozone from the upper atmosphere. Reducing ozone lets more ultraviolet light to come through. Too much ultraviolet light can cause skin cancer and cataracts, and can kill off plankton in the oceans. 
The chlorine part of CFC refrigerants can reduce ozone. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) can also damage ozone. Newer Hydrofulorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants do not have chlorine in them and do not reduce ozone in the atmosphere. Most refrigerants also increase global warming because they are powerful greenhouse gasses. These refrigerants increase global warming thousands of times more than carbon dioxide (CO).

Refrigerant

A refrigerant is a chemical that is found in an air conditioner, a refrigerator, and in other refrigeration equipment. Refrigerants can be a liquid or a vapor, depending on their temperature and pressure. Most refrigerants in their liquid state will evaporate very fast if at atmospheric pressure, but this depends on the particular refrigerant and its particular boiling point. Refrigerants in their vapor state are compressed by a compressor, then cooled by a condenser, where it condenses back into a liquid. The refrigerant is very hot as it leaves the compressor. The refrigerant then passes through a part called a metering device, or an expansion device (there are several types of this part) where the pressure is reduced to a point where the liquid begins to boil. At this point, the refrigerant is very cold and it enters an evaporator, where it absorbs heat from the air passing over it. By the time the refrigerant leaves the evaporator, it is all a vapor again, and it goes back to the compressor where the cycle begins again. This is called the refrigeration cycle. This is one example of the use of a refrigerant, as in a residential air conditioning system.

2010 Canterbury earthquake

The 2010 Canterbury earthquake was a powerful 7.1 magnitude earthquake, which struck the South Island of New Zealand at 4:35 am September 4, 2010 local time (16:35 3 September UTC). 
It was centred 40 km west of Christchurch, near the town of Darfield, at a depth of 10 km. Strong aftershocks were reported, including ones of magnitude 5.3. 
The main quake was felt widely across the South Island, and in the North Island as far north as New Plymouth.
It caused a lot of damage and cut off power and water supply, mainly in the city of Christchurch. Two people were seriously injured. The quake caused damage to historic buildings in Lyttelton, near Christchurch, including a church and parts of a hotel. Businesses in the city centre were closed the day of the quake. The total cost of damages may be as high as NZ$2 billion.
A state of emergency was declared by Civil Defence for Christchurch and the Selwyn District.
New Zealand sits on the boundary between the Australian and Pacific plates. In the South Island, these plates mainly slide past each other horizontally, producing earthquakes along fault lines such as the Alpine fault. The 2010 earthquake was centred about 80–90 km to the southeast of the plate boundary through the island, probably on one of a network of smaller faults linked to the main faults that mark the plate boundary itself.

William Langland

William Langland (ca. 1332 – ca. 1386) was an English poet. He wrote a long and complicated poem called Piers Plowman. The poem is an allegory about the struggle to lead a virtuous Christian life when the institution of the Church is often corrupt.
We do not know for sure that this poem was written by Langland. The strongest evidence we have is one manuscript which says that the poem was written by 'Willielmi de Langlond', son of 'Stacy de Rokayle, who died in Shipton-under-Wichwood, a tenant of the Lord Spenser in the county of Oxfordshire'. Other manuscripts also name the author as 'Robert or William langland', or 'Wilhelmus W.' (probably an abbreviation for 'William of Wichwood', since Wychwood is the village he probably came from). Another piece of evidence is within the poem itself. At one stage the narrator says: 'I have lyved in londe...my name is longe wille'. Scholars agree that this is a code for the poet's name: Longe-Land, and Wille meaning Will, short for William. This may seem unlikely, but this method of hiding the poet's name within a poem was used in Roman times, and was quite common in late-medieval literature.
Long Willy was a contemporary of Chaucer, the master of the pen.

Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford

Christ Church Cathedral is the cathedral of the diocese of Oxford, which includes the City of Oxford and the surrounding countryside as far north as Banbury. It is also, uniquely, the chapel of Christ Church, the largest college of the University of Oxford.
The cathedral was originally the church of St Frideswide's Priory. 
In 1522, the priory was surrendered to Cardinal Wolsey, who chose it as the site for his proposed college. However, in 1529 it was taken over by King Henry VIII. Work stopped, but in June 1532 the college was refounded by the King. In 1546, Henry VIII transferred to it from Osney Abbey to the see of Oxford. The cathedral has the name of "Ecclesia Christi Cathedralis Oxoniensis", given to it by King Henry VIII's foundation charter.
The nave, choir, central tower, and transepts (as far as the roofs) are late Norman, and were probably erected during the lifetime of Canutus, the second prior, in the 12th century. As a whole the cathedral contains examples of the various styles from late Norman to Perpendicular.
Once this was the smallest cathedral in England. As their website says, this is no longer the case:
Cathedral (or Christ Church) Time is traditionally five minutes behind Greenwich Mean Time. This dates back to the days before the railways when each region of the country kept to its own local time. Hence what is now called Cathedral Time is a survival of old Oxford Time.

Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCOR) level three was issued the following morning. By August 30, forecasts showed that a strengthening storm would strike the area, possibly bringing winds in excess of . Following this, the TCCOR level was increased to two. For the first time in over three years, TCCOR level one was declared on August 31. Military personnel and residents across the island were urged to complete their preparations and remain indoors for the duration of the typhoon. During the storm's passage on August 31, the highest warning level, TCCOR One-E (emergency) was declared. Following Kompasu's passage, the emergency warning was changed to recovery as conditions improved.
Throughout Okinawa, Kompasu brought strong winds and heavy rains, leaving an estimated 32,000 residences without power. The highest rainfall total was measured in Motobu at . Winds in excess of felled a 300-year-old tree. The Sion Pine Tree was the last of its kind on the island and was once the symbol of the northern Okinawa Region. The Okuma Recreation Facility sustained substantial damage and was closed to the public for at least a week. According to United States Air Force captain Adam Vaccarezza, concrete towers fell during the storm. Although Kompasu was a strong typhoon when it passed over Okinawa, no loss of life took place; however, five people were injured. Some homes sustained roof damage across the region, prompting a few evacuations. Additionally, Kompasu resulted in the cancellation of 432 flights to and from the island chain, stranding 57,126 people.

The writers of the "Oxford English Dictionary" think that the word "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" was first used in the 1940s. The word is a compound word, and said by Richard Lederer in his book "Crazy English" to be made up of these words: super- "above", cali- "beauty", fragilistic- "delicate", expiali- "to atone", and -docious "educable", with all of these parts combined meaning "Atoning for educability through delicate beauty." According to the movie, in which the word became widely used, the word is "something to say when you have nothing to say". However, a lot of people think the word means "extraordinarily good" or "wonderful" because all mentions of the word in the movie can be thought of as good.

Pinball

Pinball is a type of arcade game. In pinball, the player tries to score points by manipulating one or more metal balls on a playfield inside a glass-covered case called a pinball machine. The main objective of the game is to score as many points as the player can. Other objectives are to play as long as possible (by earning "extra balls" and keeping the ball in play as long as possible) and to earn free games (known as "replays").
From the 1940s through the 1970s pinball was banned in many American cities because it was thought to be a game of chance and therefore was considered gambling. The ban stopped in New York City in 1976, when Roger Sharpe, a player renowned for his talent, played so well in front of the City Council that he convinced them that pinball was indeed a game of skill, not just of luck.

Avebury

Avebury is the site of the largest ancient monument in Great Britain. It consists of a large henge, several stone circles, stone avenues and barrows. The main henge and stone circle surrounds the village of Avebury in the English county of Wiltshire.
Avebury is one of the finest and largest Neolithic monuments in Europe, about 5,000 years old. Although older than the megalithic stages of Stonehenge to the south, the two monuments are products of the same culture.
At , Avebury is roughly midway between the towns of Marlborough and Calne, just off the main A4 road. Avebury is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, a World Heritage Site, and a National Trust property.
On the World Heritage list, Avebury and Stonehenge are listed together as 'Avebury, Stonehenge and Associated Sites'. However, Stonehenge is really a different site built at a different time.
Most of the surviving structure is composed of earthworks, known as the dykes, consisting of a massive ditch and external bank henge. Although the henge is not perfectly circular, it has a diameter of about . The only known comparable sites of similar date are only a quarter of the size of Avebury. The ditch alone was 21 metres (69 ft) wide and 11 metres (36 ft) deep, with a sample from its primary fill carbon dated to 3300 - 2630 BC (4300+/-90).
Within the henge is a great outer circle. This is one of Europe's largest stone circles, with a diameter of , Britain's largest stone circle. It was either contemporary with, or built around four or five centuries after the earthworks. There were originally 98 sarsen standing stones, some weighing in excess of 40 tons. The stones varied in height from 3.6 to 4.2 m, as exemplified at the north and south entrances. The fill from two of the stoneholes has been carbon dated to between 2900 and 2600 BC (3870+/-90, 4130+/-90)
Nearer the middle of the monument are two additional, separate stone circles. The northern inner ring is in diameter, but only two of its four standing stones remain upright. A cove of three stones stood in the middle, its entrance facing northeast. The southern inner ring was in diameter before its destruction in the eighteenth century. The remaining sections of its arc now lie beneath the village buildings. A single large monolith, high, stood in the centre along with an alignment of smaller stones.
The West Kennet Avenue, an avenue of paired stones, leads from the southeastern entrance of the henge; and traces of a second, the Beckhampton Avenue, lead out from the western entrance.
Findings of archaeological geophysics suggests that a timber circle of two concentric rings stood in the northeast sector of the outer circle. This has not yet been confirmed by excavation. A ploughed barrow is visible from the air in the northwestern quadrant.
The henge had four opposing entrances, two on a north by northwest and south by southeast line, and two on an east by northeast and west by southwest line.

Henge

A henge is a Neolithic earthwork. It has a ring bank and ditch, with the ditch inside the bank. They are not thought to be defensive. For defence, it would be much better to have the ditch outside the bank so attackers would need to climb up further. Henges are typical of the British Isles, but there are a few similar structures in continental Europe.
Henges are divided into three types:

<doc id="262686" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=262686" title="Carnac stones">
Carnac stones

The Carnac stones are the largest collection of megalithic standing stones in the world. The more than 3,000 prehistoric standing stones were cut from local rock and erected by the pre-Celtic people of Brittany.
The stones were erected at some stage during the Neolithic period, probably around 3300 BC, but some may be as old as 4500 BC. The stones occur in a number of Neolithic sites around the French village of Carnac, in Brittany. They include rows of stones (alignments), dolmens, tumuli and single menhirs. 
In recent centuries, many of the sites have been neglected, with reports of dolmens being used as sheep shelters, chicken sheds or even ovens. Stones have been removed to make way for roads, or used as building materials. The management of the sites is a controversial topic.
There are three major groups of stone rows — "Ménec", "Kermario" and "Kerlescan" — which may have once formed a single group, but have been split up as stones were removed for other purposes.
Eleven converging rows of menhirs stretching for . There is what may be the remains of stone circles at either end. According to the tourist office there is a "cromlech containing 71 stone blocks" at the western end and a very ruined cromlech at the eastern end. The largest stones, around high, are at the wider, western end; the stones then become as small as 0.6m high along the length of the alignment before growing in height again toward the extreme eastern end.
This fan-like layout recurs a little further along to the east in the "Kermario" alignment. It consists of 1029 stones in ten columns, about in length. A stone circle to the east end, where the stones are shorter, was revealed by aerial photography.
A smaller group of 555 stones, further to the east of the other two sites. It is composed of 13 lines with a total length of about , ranging in height from to . At the extreme west, where the stones are tallest, there is a stone circle which has 39 stones. There may also be another stone circle to the north.
A much smaller group, further east again of Kerlescan, falling within the commune of La Trinité-sur-Mer. These are now set in woods, and most are covered with moss and ivy.
There are several tumuli, mounds of earth built up over a grave. In this area, they generally feature a passage leading to a central chamber which once held neolithic artefacts.
The tumulus of Saint-Michel was constructed between 5000 BC and 3400 BC. At its base it is , and is high. It required of stone and earth. Its function was the same as that of the pyramids of Egypt: a tomb for the members of the ruling class. It contained various funerary objects, such as 15 stone chests, pottery, jewellery, most of which are currently held by the Museum of Prehistory of Carnac. It was excavated in 1862 by René Galles with a series of vertical pits, digging down . Le Rouzic also excavated it between 1900 and 1907 discovering the tomb and the stone chests.
A chapel was built on top in 1663 but was rebuilt in 1813, before being destroyed in 1923. The current building is an identical reconstruction of the 1663 chapel, built in 1926. 
Also known as "Er Mané", it is a chamber tomb long, wide, and high. It has a dolmen at the west end, and two tombs at the east end. A small menhir, approximately high, is nearby. 
There are several dolmens scattered around the area. These dolmens are generally considered to have been tombs, however the acidic soil of Brittany has eroded away the bones. They were constructed with several large stones supporting a "capstone", then buried under a mound of earth. In many cases, the mound is no longer present, sometimes due to archeological excavation, and only the large stones remain, in various states of ruin.
There are some individual menhirs and at least one other formation which do not fit into the above categories.
An arrangement of stones to form the perimeter of a large rectangle. Originally a "tertre tumulus" with a central mound, it is long, and aligned to east of northeast. The quadrilateral is wide to the east, but only wide at the west.
Near the quadrilateral is a single massive menhir, now known as the "Giant". Over tall, it was re-erected around 1900 by Zacharie Le Rouzic, and overlooks the nearby Kerlescan alignment.

Mike Douglas

Mike Douglas, born Michael Delaney Dowd, Jr. (August 11, 1920 – August 11, 2006) was an American entertainer.
Douglas was born in Chicago, Illinois, and began singing as a choirboy. He was singing on a Lake Michigan dinner cruise ship when he was a teenager. After being in the United States Navy for a short time, he moved to Los Angeles. He was on the Ginny Simms radio show. Then, he became a singer in the big band of Kay Kyser. 
In 1950, he was the singing voice of Prince Charming in Walt Disney's "Cinderella".
In the 1950s Douglas, who was living in Burbank, California, tried to keep his singing job going. He didn't change to rock and roll, which shortened his chances of being a singer as big band music was becoming less popular. In the hardest years, he and his wife got by "flipping" their Los Angeles homes.
He next showed up in 1961 in Cleveland, where a Chicago friend hired him for $400 a week as an afternoon television host at WKYC-TV. "The Mike Douglas Show" quickly got popular and had national broadcasting in August 1963.
Many famous people were on the show. For example, Truman Capote, The Rolling Stones,Herman's Hermits and Kiss were on the show. The show helped show entertainers for the first time, like Barbra Streisand and Aretha Franklin. After the move to Philadelphia, Douglas tried to sing again, but it did not work work well.
By 1967, "The Mike Douglas Show" had 6,000,000 viewers each day, mostly women. It earned $10.5 million from advertisers. Douglas was paid more than $500,000. In 1967, the program got the first Emmy Award for Individual Achievement in Daytime Television from the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. Most weeks, Douglas would be joined by a co-host, like John Lennon & Yoko Ono, and Anne Baxter. The show went off the air in 1980.
He came down with prostate cancer in 1990, but after surgery he was cancer-free. Douglas died in August 11, 2006, on his 86th birthday.
His wife Genevieve, daughters Kelly and twins Michele and Christine lived after him.

Renata Tebaldi

Renata Tebaldi (February 1, 1922 - December 19, 2004) is an Italian operatic soprano and one of the leading lyric-dramatic sopranos of the postwar period. She possessed a voice of great beauty and considerable power which she used with unfailing musicianship and style. 
Born in Pesaro, Italy, she studied first at the Parma Conservatory with Branducci and Campogaliani, and at the Pesaro Conservatory with Carmen Melis and Giuseppe Pais. She made her debut in Rovigno in 1944, as Elena in "Mefistofele".
She was chosen by conductor Arturo Toscanini to sing at the reopening of La Scala in Milan in 1946, where she sang until 1954. She also appeared at all the major opera houses of Italy. 
She then began singing abroad and made her debut at the Royal Opera House in 1950, at the Paris Opéra in 1951, and at the Metropolitan Opera in 1955, where she was to sing regularly until 1973. She also appeared in San Francisco, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, etc.

Br'er Rabbit (also spelled Bre'r Rabbit or Brer Rabbit or Bruh Rabbit, with the title "Br'er" ) is an important character in the Uncle Remus stories in the Southern United States. He is a tricky character, and usually wins or escapes because he is clever, not because he is strong.
Br'er Rabbit came from both African and Cherokee cultures. Disney later used the character for their "The Song of the South".
In a Cherokee story, "the fox and the wolf throw the trickster rabbit into a thicket from which the rabbit quickly escapes." There was a "melding (mixing) of the Cherokee rabbit-trickster ... into the culture of African slaves." "In fact, most of the Br'er Rabbit stories originated in (came from) Cherokee myths."

Over-the-counter drugs (OTC) are drugs that do not need a prescription to be bought. When they are properly used, these drugs do not put the health of the patient in danger. Many OTC drug ingredients which were prescription drugs are now considered safe enough for use without a prescription. In many countries, there are special government agencies that regulate OTC drugs, such as the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration in the United States. Certain drugs are classified as over-the counter drugs, but may only be given by a pharmacist. This is often the case with emergency contraception medicine. It may also be the case that a small packet of a certain drug is available over the counter, but that larger packets require a prescription.

Acrostic

An acrostic is a poem or other form of writing. In an acrostic, the first letter, syllable, or word of every line, paragraph, or other feature spells out a word or a message. It can be used to remember things. For example, Edgar Allan Poe wrote an acrostic poem in English:
<poem style="margin-left: 2em">
Elizabeth it is in vain you say
"Love not" — thou sayest it in so sweet a way:
In vain those words from thee or L.E.L.
Zantippe's talents had enforced so well:
Ah! if that language from thy heart arise,
Breath it less gently forth — and veil thine eyes.
Endymion, recollect, when Luna tried
To cure his love — was cured of all beside —
His follie — pride — and passion — for he died.

The first letters of each line (E, L, I, Z, A, B, E, T, H) spell out "Elizabeth".

List of literary terms

List of literary terms: in alphabetical order.
An acrostic where the first letter of every word or verse follows the order of the alphabet. For example, in the sentence "A Bear Climbed Down", the first letter of every word is in alphabetical order: A, B, C, D.
A form of writing where the first letter of each line, paragraph, or verse spells out a word or a message.
A story or picture with two or more different meanings–a literal meaning and one or more symbolic meanings. The setting, characters, and things that happen inside an allegory are symbols for ideas or qualities.
The repeating of consonant sounds. The repetition can be put side by side (for example, ""sleepy sun sank slowly over the sea")."
A short mention of a famous historical or literary person or event.
New words, ideas, or pronunciations become like the pattern of older or more familiar ones. Comparing two different things. The purpose of an analogy is to describe something unfamiliar or new with something that is more familiar.
The character who the main character has the most conflict with. The antagonist is not always a person or animal, however: for example, the main character could have the most conflict against nature.
A short and humorous (funny) story about a real event or person.
A protagonist who does not have many heroic qualities. For example, Tom Jones in Henry Fielding's book "Tom Jones" is an antihero. Sometimes antagonists who are surprisingly likable are called antiheroes, too.
A word that has the opposite meaning of another word (for example, "up" and "down", or "male" and "female").
The good example, pattern, blueprint, or model of a type or group. All other things of the same kind are made from this.
The conversation or discourse in which the writer logically presents an opinion. It sometimes has the same meaning as persuasion.
In a play, an aside is a speech that the actor says in a way that the other characters are supposed not to hear it. It usually shows the person's inner thoughts.
A form of nonfiction. In an autobiography, a person tells his or her own life story. For example, Benjamin Franklin wrote his own famous autobiography.
A group of people that experience a work of art or literature.
A song or poem that tells a story in short stanzas and repeated simple words.
A poet hired by a patron such as a ruler or nobleman to write or sing about the patron's ancestors and to praise the patron's own works.
A form of nonfiction in which a writer tells the life story of a different person.
Poetry that does not rhyme. Most of Shakespeare's plays are in blank verse. Milton's "Paradise Lost" is also written in blank verse.
Latin expression which means "seize the day". Literary works with a carpe diem theme are about enjoying life and not worrying about dying.
A person or an animal who is part of the action of a literary work. The "main character" is the one the work focuses on. The person with whom the main character has the most conflict is the "antagonist". He is the enemy of the main character, who is usually called a "protagonist".
Characterization is the manner in which an author develops characters and their personalities. Characters can be presented by description. They can also be presented through their speech, thoughts, or actions.
A way of thinking in literature and other arts which especially focuses on the importance of reason, balance, clearness and neat, orderly form, like the arts of Greece and Rome.
A struggle between two forces against each other. It can be internal or external. When a conflict happens inside a character, it is called "internal conflict". For example, in Charlotte Brontë's novel "Jane Eyre", Jane is asking herself whether she should live with Mr. Rochester, whom she loves, or if she should go away. An "external conflict" is usually a conflict that is easy to see, happening between the protagonist and antagonist. Conflict is one of the most important elements of narrative literature.
Two statements that do not seem to agree with one another. "I heard a soundless shout" is a contradiction.
The moment or event in the plot where it is or he/she is in stress. Here, the main character usually "wins" or "loses". After the climax, there is a "denouement" (falling action).
The real, direct meaning of a word, like a "dictionary definition". For example, the word "dog" "denotes" a mammal from the family Canidae with four legs that is often kept as a pet.
Looking at and thinking about opinions or ideas logically, often by questions and answers.
Using material that is not related to the subject of the work. Henry Fielding often used digression in his novels.
A story written to be performed by actors. The person who writes the play writes dialogue for the characters to speak and directions for costumes, lighting, setting, and the character's movements.
A poem or speech in which an imaginary character speaks to a silent listener.
A solemn, formal poem about death, often for a dead person or thing. It often begins with "In Memory of..."
Ellipses are used often in everyday life as well as in literature. They usually look like this (...). It is usually used in leaving out or not using words.
An epic is a long narrative poem. The subject is usually serious, like something that was an important influence to a culture or nation.
A sentence, quotation, or poem that is put at the beginning of a written work.
A piece of writing at the end of a work of literature, especially in drama. It is usually different from the whole work and is used to end it.
A short nonfiction work about a special subject from the writer's point of view. "Essay" comes from the Old French word "essai", meaning "a trial, try, or attempt".
Foreshadowing is a literary device by which an author hints what is to come. It is used to avoid disappointment, and sometimes used to arouse readers.

Vindolanda

Vindolanda was a Roman fort at Chesterholm, just south of Hadrian's Wall in northern England. Near the modern border with Scotland, it guarded the Stanegate, the Roman road from the River Tyne to the Solway Firth. It is noted for the Vindolanda tablets, one of the most important find of military and private correspondence (written on wooden tablets) found anywhere in the Roman Empire.
The Vindolanda tablets are fragments of wooden leaf-tablets with writing in carbon-based ink. They were found at Vindolanda in northern England. The tablets date from the first and second centuries AD, which makes them roughly contemporary with Hadrian's Wall, which is near Vindolanda. The tablets contain messages to and from members of the garrison of Vindolanda, their families, and their slaves. Similar records on papyrus were known from elsewhere in the Roman Empire, but wooden tablets had not been recovered until archaeologist Robin Birley discovered them at Vindolanda in 1973. Pages have since been found at Carlisle in Cumbria, and continue to be found at Vindolanda.
Most of the tablets are official military documents. However, the best-known document is perhaps Tablet 291, written around 100 AD from Claudia Severa, the wife of the commander of a nearby fort, to Sulpicia Lepidina, wife of the commandant of Vindolanda, inviting her to a birthday party. The invitation is one of the earliest known examples of writing in Latin by a woman. It has even been claimed that this is the earliest surviving letter known to be written by a woman in any language. 
The tablets are written in Roman cursive script (joined-up writing). One of the tablets confirms that Roman soldiers wore underpants ("subligaria"), and also testifies to a high degree of literacy in the Roman army.
The tablets do not throw much light on the native Celts, but there are references. Until the discovery of the tablets, historians could only speculate on whether the Romans had a nickname for the Britons. "Brittunculi" ('little Britons') found on one of the Vindolanda tablets, is now known to be a derogatory, or patronizing, term used by the Roman garrisons to describe the locals.
The tablets are on display in the British Museum. They are regarded by the Museum as one of its 'top ten British treasures'.
The garrison were auxiliaries, Roman infantry or cavalry units, not parts of Roman legions. From the early third century AD onwards, this was the Fourth Cohort of Gauls. An inscription found in recent excavations suggests that native Gauls were in the regiment, and that they liked to distinguish themselves from British soldiers. The inscription reads:
A free translation would be "The troops from Gaul dedicate this statue to the goddess Gallia with the full support of the British-born troops".
In 1970, the Vindolanda Trust, a registered charity, was founded to administer the site and its museum. In 1997, the Trust took over the running of the Roman Army Museum at Carvoran, another Hadrian's Wall fort, which it had acquired in 1972.

Reincarnation research

Psychiatrist Ian Stevenson, from the University of Virginia, interviewed young children who claimed to remember a past life. He did more than 2,500 interviews over a period of 40 years and wrote twelve books, including "Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation". 
Stevenson found that childhood memories possibly related to reincarnation normally occurred between the ages of three and seven years. He compared the memories with reports of people known to the deceased, attempting to do so before any contact between the child and the deceased's family had occurred. 
Some 35 per cent of the children examined by Stevenson had birthmarks or birth defects. Stevenson believed that the existence of birth marks and deformities on children, when they occurred at the location of fatal wounds in the deceased, provided the best evidence for reincarnation. However, Stevenson has never claimed that he had proved the existence of reincarnation, and cautiously referred to his cases as being "of the reincarnation type" or "suggestive of reincarnation". 
Stevenson retired in 2002, and psychiatrist Jim B. Tucker took over his work, and wrote "Life Before Life: A Scientific Investigation of Children’s Memories of Previous Lives".

Monk parakeet

The Monk parakeet, or Quaker parrot, ("Myiopsitta monachus") lives in Argentina and the countries around South America. The bird is also known for passing one of its tail feathers through its bill to reconnect the barbules. This locking process is similar to pressing Velcro strips together.
The parakeet is on average 29 cm long, with a 48 cm wingspan, and weighs 100 g. Females tend to be 10-20% smaller, but it is hard to tell the sexes apart, unless they test the feather or blood DNA. It has bright green upperparts. The forehead and breast are pale grey. The bill is orange, and when it calls, it makes a loud and throaty "chape(-yee)" or "quak quaki quak-wi quarr". Sometimes, it also screeches, "skveet".
Domestic kinds of Monk parakeets may have different colors such as white, blue, and yellow instead of green.
Monk parakeets are very intelligent and social birds. When they are kept as pets, they can memorize large vocabularies. They are also able to learn many words and phrases.

Jean Cocteau

Jean Cocteau (Jean Maurice Eugène Clément Coctea, 5 July 1889 – 11 October 1963) was a French artist, poet, novelist, dramatist, designer, boxing manager, playwright, moviemaker and actor.
Cocteau wrote or worked on 21 stage performances, some of which were ballets, and some were plays. Cocteau's movies, most of which he both wrote and directed, were particularly important in introducing the avant-garde into French cinema and influenced the upcoming French New Wave genre.
He also worked with Pablo Picasso on several projects and was friends with most of the European art community. In all his creative work, he was a modernist.
In 1955, Cocteau was made a member of the "Académie Française" and The Royal Academy of Belgium. During his life Cocteau was made a Commander of the "Légion d'honneur".
Cocteau was bisexual. His circle of associates, friends and lovers included Pablo Picasso, Jean Hugo, Jean Marais, Henri Bernstein, Marlene Dietrich, Coco Chanel, Erik Satie, María Félix, Édith Piaf (whom he cast in one of his one-act plays entitled "Le Bel Indifferent" in 1940), and Raymond Radiguet.
In the 1930s, Cocteau had an affair with Princess Natalie Paley, the beautiful daughter of a Romanov grand duke. She became pregnant. To Cocteau's distress and Paley's life-long regret, the foetus was aborted. Cocteau's longest-lasting relationships were with the French actors Jean Marais (who played 'tough guy' roles in movies and TV), and Édouard Dermit, whom Cocteau formally adopted. Cocteau cast Marais in four of his movies.
At times, Cocteau was addicted to opium.
Biographer James S. Williams describes Cocteau's politics as "naturally right-leaning". In his diary, Cocteau accused France of disrespect towards Hitler and speculated on the Führer's sexuality. His views became known, and he was arraigned on charges of collaboration after the war. He was cleared of any wrongdoing: it turned out that he had used his contacts to try and save friends from the Nazis.
Cocteau died of a heart attack in Milly-la-Foret, Essonne.
Cocteau wrote or worked on 21 stage performances, some of which were ballets, and some were plays.
He was involved in Diaghilev's "Ballets Russes" from the first season in Paris, 1909. He wrote scenarios ("librettos") for Fokine's "Le Dieu Blue" in 1912, Massine's "Parade" in 1917 and Nijinska's "Le Train Bleu" in 1924. He also design company posters, and worked for several other ballet companies. He wrote many articles on dance, and made sketches of many in Diaghilev's circle.
In 1940, "Le Bel Indifférent", Cocteau's play written for and starring Édith Piaf, was enormously successful.
Cocteau directed eleven movies in "avant-gard" style, wrote scripts for six movies and dialogue for three, and directed the photography for one more. Some of his most well-known were "Blood of a Poet" (1930), "Les Parents terribles" (1948), and "Orpheus" (1949).
Cocteau wrote extensively. including poetry. All of it is in French, but some is available in translation.
Cocteau wrote five novels. The most important of these was probably "Les Enfants terribles" (1929). He also published 23 books or pamphlets of original poetry, and 26 volumes of poetic criticism and collections. He illustrated 12 works of poetry. He made a number of recordings, mostly spoken poems.

Sodium azide

Sodium azide, also known as sodium trinitride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is NaN. 
It is a white crystalline solid. It is an explosive. It can be detonated by an electric spark. It contains sodium and azide ions. It reacts with acids to produce hydrazoic acid. It can be destroyed by reacting it with nitrous acid. This reaction produces nitric oxide, nitrogen, and sodium hydroxide. It is a powerful reducing agent, which makes it explosive. It contains nitrogen in its -/ oxidation state.
It is made by reacting ammonia with sodium to make sodium amide. The sodium amide then reacts with nitrous oxide to make sodium azide. It can also be made by reacting sodium nitrate with sodium amide. Another process is reacting sodium nitrite with hydrazine.
It is used in airbags. It makes the airbags puff out. A computer detects that the car is crashing and ignites the sodium azide. This makes sodium metal and a lot of nitrogen gas. The nitrogen gas inflates the airbag. It can be used to make other explosives, such as lead azide. 
Sodium azide is very toxic. It reacts with acids to make the explosive hydrazoic acid, which also is a very toxic gas. It is similar to cyanide poisoning. It attacks the respiratory system and the circulatory system.

Sodium nitrite is a chemical compound. It contains sodium and nitrite ions. Its chemical formula is NaNO.
It is a white or yellowish crystalline compound. It is a strong oxidizing agent, being reduced to nitrogen. It is also a weak reducing agent, being oxidized to nitrate. It contains nitrogen in its +3 oxidation state. It is toxic in large amounts.
It is found in some vegetables. It is also found in some meat in small amounts. Otherwise, it is manmade.
It is used in meat like ham to preserve it. The nitrites are disinfecting, which helps preserve the meat. Almost all processed meat (like cold cuts, hot dogs) contains nitrites. Some people get headaches when they eat nitrites. These headaches have been named "hot dog headaches". It is used to make other chemicals and to get rid of sodium azide. It also can be used when someone is poisoned by cyanide. 
Nitrites can form toxic chemicals when heated. These toxic chemicals are carcinogens, which means they can cause cancer. That is why some people do not want nitrites in foods. Others say that because nitrites kill bacteria, they should be included in foods. Sodium nitrite used in food is colored bright pink so it is not mistaken for salt or sugar.

Arteriosclerosis is a diseased condition of the arteries. The artery walls are thickened, hardened and lose stretchiness, called elasticity.
There are three main types:
The effects of arteriosclerosis can lead to lack of regular blood flow. Low blood flow to the brain can make you dizzy, numb, have slurred speech, and have other symptoms. Thromboses can further block the blood flow. This causes you to be at risk of getting stroke, or a heart attack.
Arteriosclerosis is a major health problem. Arteriosclerosis can be prevented by reducing risks. Risks are smoking, obesity, and low amounts of exercise. Doctors recommend dieting and exercise. Diets consist of low amounts of cholesterol and saturated fats. Some patients may take drugs that lower the amount of cholesterol in their blood.

Indian Grand Prix

The Indian Grand Prix is the 17 race of the FIA Formula One World Championship racing calendar in 2011, following the cancellation of the season opener in Bahrain. It is scheduled to take place at the Buddh International Circuit on 30 October 2011 in Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh in India. It is subject to approval of the circuit.
Starting in 1997, there have been plans to host an Indian Grand Prix at Calcutta. In 2003, India had only two permanent raceways. One in Chennai (Irungattukottai), and Kari Memorial Speedway in Coimbatore. Two sites in the area of the Bangalore airport were consired. In the state Andhra Pradesh, land near the airport at Hyderabad were set aside. In December 2003, an seven-year preliminary agreement to host the GP in Hyderabad in 2007 was signed. The track was to be build near Gopanapally village, near the outskirts of Hyderabad. In 2004 pressure came from Mumbai, to shift the track from Hyderabad to Mumbai.
F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone expected India to host a Grand Prix within three years. He wanted a locating at either Hyderabad or Mumbai. Both projects then were declared 'dead' when Mumbai's government decided "not to waste money on car fumes while there are more serious issues".
As of 2007, five locations remained in the running for hosting the Indian Grand Prix: Bangalore, the Gurgaon district district in the state Haryana, a permanent track somewhere near New Delhi, a street circuit in New Delhi, as proposed by Vijay Mallya., and a site in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.
In June 2007, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and Bernie Ecclestone announced a provisional agreement for India to host its first Grand Prix in the 2009 F1 season. The track would be built in the Gurgaon, on recommendation by architect Hermann Tilke.
In September 2007 the IOA announced that the debut race would take place in 2010 on the Jaypee Group Circuit in Greater Noida. In September 2008, Bernie Ecclestone announced that the Indian Grand Prix has been delayed to 2011.
On 8 September, 2010, the FIA announced the schedule. The Indian Grand Prix was on the schedule. It was scheduled as the 18 race of a 20 race schedule. Before the season started, the Bahrain Grand Prix, scheduled for 13 March, was called off due to the political unrest in the country.
On 3 June, the FIA’s World Motor Sport Council announced that the Bahrain Grand Prix would be added back to the schedule. The Bahrain GP was to be held on 30 October, the original date of the Indian Grand Prix. The Indian GP would have been moved to the end of the schedule. The race teams objected to adding the Bahrain GP back to the schedule. It was removed again, and the Indian GP was set to run on the original date of 30 October.
In April, 2011, the circuit was renamed to the Buddh International Circuit
The race will be held at the Buddh International Circuit in Greater Noida, 50 km from Delhi. The circuit will be roughly 5.5 kilometres (3.1 miles) and will be designed by F1 circuit designer Hermann Tilke. The 10-year contract for the race has been given to the Indian construction company Jaiprakash Associates.
There have been a lot of infrastructure developments in Delhi for the 2010 Commonwealth Games. There has been no direct funding provided for an Indian Grand Prix. According to experts, the benefits of India joining the F1 calendar are clear. The hotel and tourism industry get an immediate boost, and the country's profile would get a lift. Experts are also that once the Indian Grand Prix starts, it could generate $170 million in revenue and employ as many as 10,000 people. There will also be opportunities for advertising between manufacturers and F1.
Leading businessman Vijay Mallya said after signing a sponsorship agreement between his Kingfisher Airlines and the Force India team that he was confident the sport would come to the subcontinent. "It has always been my dream to bring Formula One to India," he told a news conference on the sidelines of the launch of Force India's car in . "The government of Delhi I think really wants Formula One in India and I am optimistic that maybe we will be able to host our first race in 2009."
Both the Motorsports Association of India and the Federation of Motorsports Clubs of India (FMSCI) have their doubts. FMSCI president, Rajat Mazumbar, has said that "The only authorized body that can run motorsports in the country is ours" despite the fact the deal has been signed with the Indian Olympic Association.
Increased awareness has led to the popularity of merchandise, Formula 1 tickets, and race tours to F1 destinations.

Georges Braque

Georges Braque (Argenteuil, 13 May 1882 – Paris, 31 August 1963) was a major 20th century French painter and sculptor who, with Pablo Picasso, developed the art movement known as Cubism.
French art critic Louis Vauxcelles first used the term "Cubism", or "bizarre cubiques", in 1908 after seeing a picture by Braque. He described it as 'full of little cubes', after which the term quickly gained wide use. Art historian Ernst Gombrich described cubism as "the most radical attempt to stamp out ambiguity, and to enforce one reading of the picture – that of a man-made construction, a colored canvas". The Cubist movement spread quickly throughout Paris and Europe.
A major idea of Braque's was the fractured stringed instrument as a cubist model. This he painted a number of times with variations, and made sculptures with fractured violins, guitars, etc., inside transparent acrylic (perspex) blocks. Examples:

<doc id="263050" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=263050" title="Vaslav Nijinsky">
Vaslav Nijinsky

Vaslav Nijinsky (Kiev, Ukraine, 12 March 1890–London, England, 8 April 1950) was the most famous male ballet dancer of the early 20th century, and an important choreographer. He was born to Polish parents, both of whom were dancers. 
Nijinsky was famous for his dancing ability, and of his ability to show the character of the part he was playing. He could dance "en pointe", a rare skill among male dancers at the time. His ability to perform seemingly gravity-defying leaps was legendary. The ballerina and choreographer Bronislava Nijinska was his sister. They both danced for the Imperial Ballet at the Mariinsky Theatre, and later for the Ballets Russes of Serge Diaghilev.
In 1900 Nijinsky joined the Imperial Ballet School at St Petersburg, where he studied under great trainers such as Enrico Cecchetti. At 18 he was given a string of leads. In 1910, the company's "prima ballerina assoluta" Mathilde Kschessinska selected Nijinsky to dance in a revival of Marius Petipa's "Le Talisman". Nijinsky created a sensation in the role of the Wind God Vayou.
His performance in "The Sleeping Beauty" (music by Tchaikovsky) was a tremendous success. In 1910 he performed in "Giselle", and Fokine's ballets "Carnaval" and "Scheherazade" (based on the orchestral suite by Rimsky-Korsakov). His partnership with Tamara Karsavina, in the Mariinsky Theatre, was highly praised: they were called the "most exemplary artists of the time".
A turning point for Nijinsky was his meeting Sergei Diaghilev. Diaghilev was a celebrated entrepreneur (organiser) of ballet and art exhibitions, who promoted Russian visual and musical art abroad. From that moment on, Diaghilev directed and managed Nijinsky's career, and they became lovers. 
In 1909 Diaghilev took a company of Russian opera and ballet stars to Paris, featuring Nijinsky and Anna Pavlova. The season of colourful Russian ballets and operas, works mostly new to the West, was a great success. It led Diaghilev to create his famous company "Les Ballets Russes" with choreographer Michel Fokine and designer Léon Bakst. The Paris seasons of the Ballets Russes were an artistic and social sensation; setting trends in art, dance, music and fashion for the next decade.
Nijinsky also choreographed ballets. They were avant-garde and controversial. His ballets were "L'après-midi d'un faune" ("The Afternoon of a Faun", based on Claude Debussy's music) (1912), "The Rite of Spring" (1913), "Jeux" (1913) and "Till Eulanspiegel" (1916). 
In "The Rite of Spring" ("Le Sacre du Printemps"), with music by Stravinsky (1913), Nijinsky created choreography which went beyond the limits of traditional ballet. For the first time, his audiences got a sight of modern dance. The angular movements expressed the heart of Stravinsky's radically modern score. The music and dance caused a riotous reaction at the "Théâtre de Champs-Élysées" when they premiered in Paris. Both the music and dance were landmarks in modernism.
In 1913 the Ballets Russes toured South America. Diaghilev did not make this journey, because of a fear of sea travel. Free from Diaghilev's supervision, Nijinsky became acquainted with Romola de Pulszky, a Hungarian countess. Eventually, she succeeded in engaging his affections. They were married in Buenos Aires, and later had a daughter, Kyra. When the company returned to Europe Diaghilev flew into a rage, and dismissed Nijinsky. 
During World War I Nijinsky was interned in Hungary. Diaghilev succeeded in getting him out for a North American tour in 1916. During this time, Nijinsky choreographed and danced the leading role in "Till Eulenspiegel". Around this time, signs of his schizophrenia was noticed by members of the company. He suffered a nervous breakdown in 1919, and his career effectively ended. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and taken to Switzerland by his wife. He spent the rest of his life in and out of psychiatric hospitals and asylums, as his family travelled round Europe. He never danced again.

Kansas City, Kansas

Kansas City is the third-largest city in the U.S. state of Kansas. It is the county seat of Wyandotte County. Kansas City is a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri and is the third largest city in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area. About two million people live in this region. The city is part of the "Unified Government". This also includes the cities of Bonner Springs and Edwardsville. As of the 2000 census, the city population was 146,867. The city is at Kaw Point, which is the junction of the Missouri and Kansas rivers.
Kansas City formed in 1868. It was first officially mentioned in October 1872. The Kansas-Missouri border area became the first battlefield in the conflict over slavery that led to the American Civil War. The first city election was held on October 22, 1872. It resulted in the election of Mayor James Boyle. The mayors of the city after its organization have been James Boyle, C. A. Eidemiller, A. S. Orbison, Eli Teed and Samuel McConnell. John Sheehan was appointed Marshal in 1875. He was also Chief of Police. He had the control over five policemen. In June 1880, the Governor of Kansas made the city of Kansas City a city of the second class with the Mayor Samuel McConnell present. James E. Porter was Mayor in 1910.
It was one of the 100 largest cities for many US Census counts, from 1890–1960, including 1920, when it had over 100,000 residents for the first time. In 1997, voters approved a proposition to unify the city and county governments.
On March 30, 2011, Internet search company Google Inc. announced that Kansas City had been selected as the site of an experimental fiber-optic network that Google will build at no cost to the city. Kansas City was chosen from a field of 1,100 US communities that had applied for the network. Google plans to have the network in operation by 2012.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 127.8 sq mi (331.0 km²). 124.3 sq mi (321.8 km²) of it is land and 3.5 sq mi (9.2 km²) of it is water.
Kansas City is organized into a system of neighborhoods, some with histories as independent cities or the sites of major events.
Neighborhoods of Kansas City, Kansas
Kansas City is near "Tornado Alley", a region where cold air from the Rocky Mountains and Canada meets warm air from the Gulf of Mexico. This situation causes the formation of powerful storms. The most recent tornado to strike Kansas City itself was in May 2003. The region is also prone to ice storms, such as the 2002 ice storm during which hundreds of thousands lost power for days and (in some cases) weeks. The MoKan area was subject to flooding, including the Great Flood of 1993 and the Great Flood of 1951.
Kansas City has four sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International:

<doc id="263141" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=263141" title="History of Iran">
History of Iran

Iran is home to one of the world's oldest continuous major civilizations, with historical and urban settlements dating back to 4000 BC. The Medes unified Iran as a nation and empire in 625 BC.
The Islamic conquest of Persia (633–656) and the end of the Sassanid Empire was a turning point in Iranian history. Iran had been a monarchy ruled by a shah, or emperor, almost without interruption from 1501 until the 1979 Islamic revolution, when Iran officially became an Islamic Republic on 1 April 1979.
Before Iran was called Iran, and before Iranians lived there, a different group of people lived in Iran. These people were called the Elamites. The Elamites are mentioned in the Bible. The Elamites lived in a kingdom called Elam. Elam was conquered by Iranian peoples, such as the Medes (a type of Iranian), because the Elamites became weak after fighting the Assyrians (a different people) for too long. The Iranians would then go on to conquer the Assyrians, as well. 
Iran used to be called Persia for a long time by people outside of Iran. Iranians or Persians since the Sassanian era called their country "Iran". But, the official name was Persia, meaning that this was the name used in foreign Foreign relationsrelationships and in government papers. In 1935, Reza Shāh Pahlavi, then shāh of Iran, officially renamed the country "Iran". This was done to show that Iran belonged to all the non-Persian Iranians as well as to Persian Iranians. The name Iran comes from "Aryan" and is also mentioned in the ancient book of the Zoroastrians, which was called the Avesta. "Iran" means "Aryan" in Persian. In the 19th and early 20th century, the name "Aryan" was used by Europeans to mean "all Indo-Europeans". 
Around 500 BC, present-day Iran was the center of the Persian Empire. Then, Alexander the Great took the country by fighting and the "Achaemenid dynasty" of Persia later ruled. After them the "Sassanian dynasty" (224-651) took over.
Other people took Persia by fighting, like the Arabs (7th century), Turks (10th century) and Mongols (13th century). However, Iran has always maintained a distinct culture and continued to survive.
The "Safavid dynasty" (1502-1736) made Islam and Shi'a the religion of Iran although Islam was always popular then. The latest kings of Iran were from the "Pahlavi dynasty", and ruled from 1925 until 1979, when there was a revolution and Ayatollah Khomeini created an Islamic republic.
In 1951, Mohammed Mossadegh was brought to power after being elected as prime minister by nearly all members of the Majlis (parliament) in Iran. His first act in office was to take control of the oil industry in Iran which had been controlled by Great Britain. Most of Britain's oil was pumped from Iran at the time. This move was seen as a danger to Great Britain's security and empire, so they tried to overthrow the government but failed. After this they convinced the United States through diplomacy that the government of Iran was a communist threat.
The CIA worked in Iran to create riots which led to the removal of Prime Minister Mossadegh. The United States and Great Britain then made the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi King of Iran, again.
He ruled in Iran for less than a year when he left Iran and the Iranian government was changed to an Islamic Republic by Islamic Revolution. Soon afterwards, Iranian Students Movement (Tahkim Vahdat), with the backing of the new government took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held most of the diplomats hostage for 444 days. Relations between the two countries have not been good since. For example. The US has imposed various types of economic sanctions against Iran. The US claims the Iran supports terrorist groups against Israel. Iran does not recognize Israel as a state. Iran, along with most Arab countries believe that Israel does not have the right to occupy the land of Palestinians.
Iran has long borders in common with Iraq. (The words "Iran" and "Iraq" are similar only in Latin alphabet. In Arabic and Persian, they are written differently.) Iranians are ethnically not Arabs. Iran defended itself against Iraqi invasion in 1980, a war that lasted eight years. Many Arab and Western countries, including the United States provided weapons (including biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction) and technical support for Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
Now, the West is trying to prevent Iran from mastering nuclear technology, even though Iran is a member of the NPT. They voice their concern claiming that Iran's intention is to develop nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported numerous times that there is no evidence that Iran is developing nuclear weapons, however, it also says that it can not say for sure that Iran is not doing so in secret. A CIA report on nuclear activity in Iran, in December 2007 claimed that Iran's secret program to achieve nuclear weapons technology was stopped in 2003, and that since then, it was never restarted. It reports that Iran's ability to build a nuclear weapon will probably not happen soon.
The presidential elections of 13th June 2009 were officially won by the existing president M. Ahmadinejad, but certain people do not believe this is true. There were demonstrations because of these results, and some protesters fought with police forces. Many people who demonstrated thought that the election was a fraud. Officially nine people died during the protests.

Cobalt(II) chloride

Cobalt(II) chloride, also known as cobaltous chloride and cobalt dichloride, is a chemical compound. It contains cobalt in its +2 oxidation state. Its chemical formula is CoCl. It contains cobalt and chloride ions.
Cobalt(II) chloride is normally found in the red (or pink) form. The red form has water in it. It can be heated to turn it into the blue form, without water. The blue form will absorb water from the air and turn red again. 
A different blue form is made when cobalt(II) chloride is reacted with a chemical compound that has chloride in it. Hydrochloric acid works the best, but sodium chloride can be used too. When it is heated, it turns more blue than when it is cooled. 
It can be oxidized to cobalt(III) compounds, although cobalt(III) chloride does not exist. If it is made, it just drops a Cl from CoCl, making CoCl (cobalt(II) chloride) again.
The anhydrous (without water) blue form can be made by reacting cobalt with chlorine. The hydrated (with water) red form can be made by reacting cobalt(II) oxide or cobalt(II) hydroxide with hydrochloric acid. 
It is used to place cobalt into other chemical compounds. It can be used to make other cobalt compounds. It is the most common cobalt compound in the lab. 
It is a weak oxidizing agent, too weak to ignite things. Cobalt compounds are toxic in large quantities, like any other transition metal compounds. They are not toxic like lead or mercury compounds, though.

Prohibition Era

The Prohibition Era was a period in United States history when alcohol was outlawed. Police would arrest anyone who was found making or selling alcohol illegally. The Women's Christian Temperance Union and other reformist organizations agitated for this change. Prohibition lasted from 1920 to 1933. It was established by the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It was ratified (approved by the states) by January 16, 1919. It came into effect at January 16, 1920. 
Prohibition was good as the consumption of alcohol was reduced, but it was bad in that the Mafia and other underground organizations took up rum-running. They became big and powerful and made trouble. Prohibition was repealed December 5, 1933 by the Twenty-first Amendment. Now states can regulate the selling of liquor by themselves.

Ramsar Convention

The Ramsar Convention (The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitat) is an international treaty to protect wetlands. It is meant to stop the loss of wetland areas now and in the future. It recognizes that wetlands are an important ecosystem. It also recognizes that wetlands have economic, cultural, scientific, and recreational value. It is named after the town of Ramsar in Iran.
The convention was developed and agreed to by 18 nations at a meeting in Ramsar on February 2, 1971. It came into force on December 21, 1975.
The Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance now includes 1,888 sites, which are called "Ramsar Sites", covering around 1,853,000 km². This has increased from 1,021 sites in 2000. The nation with the most sites is the United Kingdom at 168. The nation with the greatest area of listed wetlands is Canada, with over 130,000 km², including the Queen Maud Gulf Migratory Bird Sanctuary at 62,800 km².
There are now 159 nations that have agreed to the convention. The nations meet every three years as the Conference of the Contracting Parties (COP). The first meeting was held in Cagliari, Italy, in 1980. Changes to the original convention have been agreed to in Paris (1982) and Regina (1987).
There is a standing committee, a scientific review panel, and a secretariat. The headquarters is located in Gland, Switzerland, shared with the IUCN.

Eyeborg

An eyeborg or eye-borg is an electronic eye that allows people to hear colors. It is mostly used by blind people or by people with color blindness. It works by using a head mounted camera that reads the colors directly in front of a person, and converts them into musical notes.
The first eyeborg was made in England in 2003 by Adam Montandon in collaboration with colourblind artist Neil Harbisson. The invention won a British award in Innovation (Submerge 2004) and a European award in Content Tools and Interface Design (Europrix 2004). In 2007, Peter Kese, a software developer from Slovenia, made further developments to the eyeborg by increasing the number of colors to 360 and adding color intensity through different volume levels. Matias Lizana, a student from Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya is currently developing the eyeborg into a smaller chip as part of his final year project. The new chip will allow users to hear colors in stereo and to embed the device.

Christian Dior

Christian Dior (Granville, Manche, Basse-Normandie, 21 January 1905 – Montecatini, Italy, 24 October 1957), was the leading French fashion designer of the post-war world. He was the founder of one of the world's top fashion houses, the "House of Dior" (now "Christian Dior").
During the German occupation of France in World War II, Christian Dior dressed the wives of Nazi officers and French collaborators. On 8 October 1946 he founded his own fashion house, backed by Marcel Boussac, the cotton-fabric magnate.
For his first collection, in early 1947, the phrase "The New Look" was coined by "Harper's Bazaar", the fashion monthly. Dior's designs were more voluptuous than the economy shapes of World War II, when fabric was rationed. 
Dior was a master at creating shapes and silhouettes; he said "I have designed flower women". His look employed fabrics lined with percale (a closely woven plain-weave fabric), boned, bustier-style bodices, hip padding, wasp-waisted corsets and petticoats. This made his dresses flare out from the waist, giving his models a very curvaceous form. 
Some women protested, because his designs covered up their legs, which they did not during wartime. There was also criticism of Dior's designs, which used a lot of fabric. Opposition ceased as soon as wartime shortages ended. The New Look revolutionized women's dress and reestablished Paris as the center of the fashion world.
The term was first used by Dior as the label for his collection of spring 1955. The A-Line collection's feature item, then the "most wanted silhouette in Paris", was a "fingertip-length flared jacket worn over a dress with a very full, pleated skirt". Evening dresses at this time were always worn with petticoats.
Although an A-shape, this silhouette was not identical to what is now understood to embody the A-line idea. That idea was given its definitive expression and popularized by Dior’s successor, Yves Saint Laurent, with his "Trapeze Line" of spring 1958, which featured dresses flaring out dramatically from a fitted shoulder line. 
A-line clothes remained popular in the 1960s and 70s, disappeared from fashion almost completely by the early 1980s and were revived by the retro trend of the late 1990s. By that time, 'A-line' was used more loosely to describe any dress wider at the hips than at the bust or waist, as well as a number of flared skirt styles. 'True' A-line shapes on the pattern of Dior and Saint Laurent saw a revival in the early 2000s.

I see over half of the top 50 are huge lists full of red links. There are nine in the top ten. This includes some pages which don't actually have 'list' in title, but are one in fact. Most I've checked are text dumps from enWP, and scarcely worked on since. They are the devil to download, and pretty useless as a way to get to pages. Many of them go to an insane level of detail from the point of view of our wiki. There is another way to approach lists. It is to cut them down ruthlessly to a minimum, using the notability criterion more severely. An example: when faced with the present inflated number of chess Grandmasters (over 1500), after some agreement on the talk page and elsewhere, the list was cut to those rated over 2700 (that's about 50) plus any others thought to be significant. The has been helpful in providing a small support group. An even more radical move would be to list only those pages we already have on a subject in this wiki. Thus lists could become 'List of our XYZ pages'.What I'm suggesting is a "Cut down overlong lists" project. ()

"20-Sep-2010:" I will be focusing on putting some broader, medicine-related articles on Simple WP. As if there weren't enough problems already, as you might know, many articles on enwiki are being converted into a "doctor's view" of the subject. It's as if "Hair" will cease to be a concern of fashion or cultural trends or barbershops, and instead, all hair-related articles on English WP will be rewritten for medical concerns such as hair-follicle pathology (illness), listing only major symptoms and treatment of hair diseases. The final straw, for me, was the enwiki renaming of "Diaper rash" as "" (on 10-Sep-2010 after many similar renamings). In the U.S., many medical doctors have an attitude problem, which they don't see as POV-pushing, but instead, the hospital system typically worships doctors by high salary, fame, and keeping nurses and med-techs to "stay in their place" as inferior underlings. Does anyone know of any formal complaints of that medical takeover on enwiki, or have other editors noted they are coming to Simple WP to save broad-minded articles from becoming POV-funnels for medical data? Some enwiki article revisions from 2008 might still contain broader views of medical-related topics, so those writings could be simplified for use here. I think it is good that medics are adding details on enwiki; unfortunately, they seem to be axing any prior article contents which are not shown in medical encyclopedias, so issues such as hygiene, laundry or house design are likely to be axed as insignificant trivia which clutters a doctor's reading for hospital concerns. To recap the problem in a nutshell, by paraphrasing U.S. General George Patton, "Compared to War  Medicine, all forms of human endeavour shrink to insignificance". It might be very difficult to stop doctors from replacing articles as "Medi-pedia" texts. Therefore, perhaps there should be a guideline for Simple WP to warn about keeping medical-related articles as broader in scope, than the narrow view of some doctors. Anyone have other thoughts about this? - () 13:47, 20 September 2010 (UTC)

I had a look at the article list. It looks like it was last updated 4 months ago. I recently did a calculation: Suppose a bot would get one page every ten seconds, thisw bot would need about 7.5 days to go through all (roughly 65k) articles we have. It would therefore be possible to run such a bot once to twice a month, which would give us more accurate data on the "most wanted" articles.
I wonder how such tasks are handled at other wikipedias, and who would be responsible for developing such a bot, if none exists. -- () 12:38, 4 October 2010 (UTC)

But I think before we go any further, we need to agree that an "up-to-date" (monthly) most wanted list would be a good thing to have. -- () 21:21, 5 October 2010 (UTC)

The template generates the news article title as an html link. It also outputs the html url address. The url is wrapped in a set of codice_1 tags. This is to display the url only when a printable version of the article is produced. On enwp, MediaWiki:Common.css has a class printonly with attributes codice_2. Simple seems to be missing this class. The result is the raw url link is also displayed in the reference section. For an example, check Indianapolis Motor Speedway, reference link number 10, and compare to , reference link number 10.
It also appears that the other cite template on enwp use the same printonly class. On simple, it look like only news, book, journal, and mailing list use the class. Should the templates be changed, or common.css can be updated?-- () 04:37, 10 October 2010 (UTC)

Does anyone care about how much subtle vandalism there is here that goes undetected? (Not everyone places obscenities all over every page.) I wonder why there isn't a stronger effort to deal with the non-blatant vandals, given that the ones who use foul language, which is trivial to detect, are an easy catch. 
Since WikiLeaks has become a hot topic over the last days I feel it's a good idea to explain a chat I had with Mike Godwin (the WMF lawyer) about how to use WikiLinks in our articles. We should not quote or cite a WikiLeaks document directly due to legal problems that could occur. If you are planning on using some of the newly "released" information from WikiLeaks the way to do it safely for us is to quote or cite a third party who quotes or cites WL. So, if I wanted to include information about the claimed shooting of an 8-year-old girl by a British soldier, which is one of the events WikiLeaks claims top secret documents show, then I would quote or cite the Mail of Sunday article's treatment of it and what it said, but not the WikiLeaks document directly. 14:57, 25 October 2010 (UTC)

Wow. It's been a while since I popped by, but to see that has had 11 edits since the beginning of September is shameful. Is this Wikipedia ignoring the idea of promoting good content? Are editors here not asking for help in making decent articles? There are a number of decent editors, most of whom are contactable by email, and it takes maybe 20 minutes to look at some of the candidates for GA/VGA. 
If this Wikipedia continues to fail in producing reasonable quality articles, and persists in being a chatroom, I suggest the Wikimedia Foundation switch it off. If you guys want to keep it going, make it useful. I remember the days when one GA/VGA a month was minimum, now it's a rare event and that, frankly, is pathetic and a waste of the resources of this charity. () 20:41, 12 October 2010 (UTC)
Hello everyone, just a quick pop in to thank you for at least reacting to a comment I made. The so-called "threat" was nothing other than a suggestion that this Wikipedia focus on making a little quality content rather a ton of mediocre content. My nudge at Facebook was to remind folks that this (or associated IRC) is not a place for smalltalk and chat. I know wholeheartedly that we're all volunteers (if you doubt it, check my total contributions to the charity across this and en-wiki) but a Wikipedia which fails to produce "good" content is a useless one. I'm sorry but 5,000 stubs on footballers is all very well but how useful is it to the "simple English speaker" or the "school child" at which this Wikipedia is aimed? Eptalon and I have not agreed wholeheartedly on too much in the past, but the one thing he has always advocated is a minimum "set of excellence" (Eptalon, forgive my paraphase, and feel free to correct me), in other words, a set of articles which we can use to show "simple English speakers" or "school children" that this is a useful website. I've seen some decent subjects go through to PVGA/PGA but there's no real interest here in getting these articles to an excellent state. I'd love to spend more time helping articles get to GA/VGA (and I know I'm slack, I made 8 reasonably easy VGAs out of our total of 38) but until there's a groundswell of interest in doing this, there's no point. If anyone (and I mean anyone) nominates a GA/VGA, and wants a review, email me. I'll do my best. () 17:34, 17 October 2010 (UTC)
I've been giving this whole discussion some thought and have an idea. I'm still pretty new around here, so apologies in advance if this has already been discussed. I've started to act on my idea already anyway, so if anyone else cares to join in, please!
One problem as I see it is how to best use the scarce time and resources of editors on GA/VGA. I agree with Kansan that often I'd rather work on getting a greater number of articles up to a usable standard than trying to carry each of them through the vetting process.
But, as TRM said there is some value in "a minimum 'set of excellence' … in other words, a set of articles which we can use to show 'simple English speakers' or 'school children' that this is a useful website." We can't make all of the pages excellent, but it might be a good idea to prioritize some articles that visitors are more likely to see and to read. If a new visitor's first experience is a GA or VGA, that would be great.
Here is an example. According to the Telegraph UK, [Twitter] was the 13th most visited page on enWP in 2009. Twitter on Simple ranks 1111 according to these stats. The Twitter article on Simple was a stub and a GA on enWP. To me, that indicates that time spent trying to get content from enWP and simplifying to create a GA here is worthwhile. More visitors may read it.
Of course, a lot of the energy and dedication to create a GA or VGA will come from editors' personal interest and they should follow that. I think I'll keep working on some obscure music pages as well. But, if the idea is to get a set of top quality articles to show the world, working on what web users seem to want would be a good idea too.
I've gone ahead and simplified the intro from enWP and added it to the Simple article for Twitter. I'll work on some other parts later, but if anyone else cares to, the infobox needs work and these sections remain to be done:
1 History
2 Overview
3 Finances
4 Technology
5 t.co
6 Reception
So, my questions. Does anyone else think this is a worthwhile approach? If so, is there a way to get better stats? For example, which of the top 100 good articles visited on enWP are stubs on Simple? Or, even more directly, which of the most-visited articles on Simple are still stubs?
Thanks, () 01:52, 23 October 2010 (UTC)

Homalocephale was a thick-skulled, plant-eating dinosaur. Its flat head housed a very thick skull, a tiny brain, and large eyes. The skull consisted of porous, non-rigid bone interlaced with blood vessels.
"Homalocephale" grew to be about 5 feet long (1.5 m) and weighed about 95 pounds (43 kg). "Homalocephale" probably had a good sense of smell. It had bumpy knobs on its snout and along the rear of its skull. It had leaf-shaped teeth, short forelimbs and a stiff tail.

Arnhem Land

The Arnhem Land Region is one of the five regions of the Northern Territory of Australia. It is in the north east corner of the territory and is about 500km from the territory capital Darwin. It has an area of 97,000 km². This area includes Kakadu National Park. About 16,230 people live in Arnhem Land. It was named by Matthew Flinders after the Dutch ship "Arnhem", which explored the coast in 1623. 
Arnhem Land goes from Port Roper on the Gulf of Carpentaria around the coast to the East Alligator River where it joins Kakadu National Park. The major towns are Jabiru on the Kakadu National Park border, Maningrida on the Liverpool River mouth, and Nhulunbuy (also known as Gove) in the far north east, on the Gove Peninsula. Gove is the site of large bauxite mine with an alumina refinery. Its administrative centre is the town of Nhulunbuy, the fourth largest town in the Northern Territory.
The climate of Arnhem Land is tropical monsoon with a wet and dry season. Temperatures do not vary much during the year. It can get as cold as 15 degrees Celsius during nights in the dry season (April to September). In the wet season (October to March) the days can be as hot as 33 degrees Celsius.
Arnhem Land became an Aboriginal Reserve in 1931. It is still one of the largest Aboriginal Reserves in Australia. It is best known for its remoteness, its art, and the strong continuing traditions of its people. North east Arnhem Land is home to the Yolngu people, one of the largest indigenous groups in Australia. They have been able to keep their traditional indigenous culture. The Malays and Macassans are believed to have had contact with the coastal Aboriginal groups and traded with them prior to European settlement of Australia.
The 2006 movie "Ten Canoes" shows life in Arnhem land with a story that uses old Aboriginal stories. It was co-directed by one of the cast members. The movie and also the movie about how it was made, "The Balano and the Bark Canoes", shows the great struggle the indigenous people have made to keep their culture alive. 
The Aboriginal town of Yirrkala, just outside Nhulunbuy, is famous throughout the world. This is because of its bark paintings, and its role in supporting the rights of Indigenous Australians. It is also the place where the Yidaki, or Didgeridoo, came from. The town of Gunbalanya, once called Oenpelli, in Western Arnhem Land is also famous for its bark painting. 
Arnhem Land is famous for its Aboriginal rock art. Some of the best art can be found at Ubirr Rock, Injalak Hill, and in the Canon Hill area. Some of these show early visits by Europeans, sometimes in such detail that Martini-Henry rifles can be identified. Other paintings show axes, aircraft and ships. In one rock shelter, hundreds of kilometres from Darwin, there is a painting the wharf at Darwin. It shows buildings and boats, the Europeans with their hats and pipes. Some are shown without hands, which they have in their pockets. There is a painting, near the East Alligator River crossing, which shows a man with a gun and long pigtails down his back. This would be one of the Chinese workers brought to Darwin in the late 19th century. The people also make ritual sand sculptures which do not last.
One Yolngu stone arrangement, at Maccasans Beach near Yirrkala, shows the layout of the Macassan praus (ships) used for Trepang fishing. The Yolngu traded with the people of Makassar on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. This trading was happening 200 years before European settlement.

Joseph Banks

Sir Joseph Banks, 1st Baronet GCB PRS (13 February 1743 – 19 June 1820) was an English naturalist, botanist and patron of the natural sciences. Banks was President of the Royal Society 1778–1820; baronet 1781; Privy Counsellor 1797. His collections were given to the British Museum.
Banks took part in Captain James Cook's first great voyage from 1768 to 1771. He inherited a large fortune, and was able to hire his own team to help collect, package and transport his finds. Banks discovered and collected "Eucalyptus", "Acacia", "Mimosa", and "Banksia". About 80 species of plants are named after Banks. 
Banks was educated at Harrow School, Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford.
In 1766 Banks was elected to the Royal Society, and in the same year he accompanied Phipps to Newfoundland and Labrador to study their natural history. He made his name by publishing the first Linnean descriptions of the plants and animals of Newfoundland and Labrador.
Banks was promptly appointed to a joint Royal Navy/Royal Society scientific expedition to the south Pacific Ocean on "HMS Endeavour", 1768–1771. This was the first of James Cook's voyages of discovery in that region. Banks joined the ship with a staff of eight: Daniel Solander and H.D. Spöring, naturalists; Alexander Buchan and Sydney Parkinson, artists; James Roberts and Peter Briscoe, tenants from Revesby; Thomas Richmond and George Dorlton (Dollin), negro servants. Only four of this party survived the voyage, Banks himself, Solander and the two Revesby men.
This voyage went first to Brazil, where Banks made the first scientific description of a now common garden plant, "Bougainvillea" (named after Cook's French counterpart, Louis Antoine de Bougainville), and to other parts of South America. 
The voyage then went to Tahiti (where the transit of Venus was observed, the purpose of the mission), to New Zealand and to the east coast of Australia, where Cook mapped the coastline and made landfall at Botany Bay and at Endeavour River (near modern Cooktown) in Queensland, where they spent seven weeks ashore while the ship was repaired after damage on the Great Barrier Reef. 
While they were in Australia Banks, Solander and Spöring made the first collection of Australian plants, describing many that were new to science. Almost 800 specimens were illustrated by the artist Sydney Parkinson and appear in "Banks' Florilegium", finally published in 35 volumes between 1980 and 1990.
Banks arrived back in England on 12 July 1771 and immediately became famous.
There are many things in Australia named after Banks. These include the Division of Banks, a Federal Electoral Division for the Australian House of Representatives in the state of New South Wales. The species Banksia is named after him.

Petticoat

A petticoat is a woman's undergarment, shaped like a skirt or skirt+bodice. Think of it as a skirt underneath a regular skirt. The purpose is possibly insulation, and certainly to make the skirt fly out in an attractive way. 
Petticoats which are starched, with ruffles, or made with stiff fabric, can support a wider skirt. The ultimate in this trend is the crinoline, which is a petticoat structure which includes hoops of whalebone. Crinolines are not worn today, but petticoats are sometimes worn with ballgowns.
For most of the first half of the 20th century, with a few exceptions, petticoats were out of fashion. Certainly "multiple" petticoats were not needed for the narrow skirts and dresses which were fashionable. Some evening gowns needed petticoats, but they were finished off by WWII wartime rationing and shortages.
Petticoats were revived by Christian Dior in his full-skirted "New Look" of 1947. Tiered, ruffled, stiffened petticoats remained extremely popular during the 1950s, especially with teenage girls. Typically, at least three single petticoats were worn, until manufacturers began making double and triple layer petticoats. A narrow slip was usually worn under the petticoats, especially the crinoline type, because they tended to be 'scratchy'.
Dior continued this theme with his "A-Line" collection of Spring 1955, which featured the "most wanted silhouette in Paris". This was a "fingertip-length flared jacket worn over a dress with a very full, pleated skirt". Evening dresses at this time were always worn with petticoats.
Although an A-shape, this silhouette was not identical to what is now understood to embody the A-line idea. That idea was given its definitive expression and popularized by Dior’s successor, Yves Saint Laurent, with his "Trapeze Line" of Spring 1958, which featured dresses flaring out dramatically from a fitted shoulder line. A-line clothes remained popular in the 1960s and 70s.

Paul the Octopus

Paul the Octopus (said to be hatched January 2008 at Oberhausen, Germany– 26 October 2010) was an octopus living in a tank at a Sea Life Centre in Oberhausen, Germany. Paul became famous around the world for correctly "choosing" the winner of Germany's seven matches at the 2010 World Cup, as well as the final.
During the divinations, Paul was shown two boxes with a mussel inside them, for food. Each box had, on the outside, a flag of a football team. Paul would eat the mussel from the box with the flag of the winning team. He did this correctly in four of Germany's six Euro 2008 matches, and in all seven of their matches in the 2010 World Cup. He correctly chose a win for Spain against the Netherlands in the World Cup final. His predictions were 100% (8/8) right for the 2010 World Cup and 86% (12/14) correct overall. Paul was retired after the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
It was at first said that Paul's career as an oracle began during the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament. In the lead-up to Germany's international football matches, Paul (or a similar octopus) was presented with two clear plastic boxes, each containing food: a mussel or an oyster. Each container was marked with the flag of a team, one the flag of Germany, and the other the flag of Germany's opponent. The box which Paul opened first (and ate the contents of) was judged to be the predicted winner of the game.
Some people had doubt about the octopus' abilities.
Under the thought that Paul had the same chances of choosing the winner or the loser of a match, and not considering the chance of a draw, he had a 1/2 chance of rightly choosing any single game and a 1/256 chance of rightly choosing eight in a row.
On October 26 2010, Paul died of natural causes after being inactive for the last few days.

Gianni Versace (Reggio Calabria, 2 December 1946 – Miami Beach, Florida, 15 July 1997) was an Italian fashion designer and founder of Versace S.p.A., an international fashion house.
The fashion house also produces accessories, fragrances, makeup and home furnishings as well as clothes. Versaci also designed costumes for the theatre and movies, and was a friend of Elton John, Sting, and Princess Diana among many others. 
Openly gay, Versace and his partner Antonio D'Amico were regulars on the international party scene. Versace was murdered outside his Miami Beach home, the former Casa Casuarina, at the age of 50 by spree killer Andrew Cunanan.
Versace was shot dead on 15 July 1997, aged 50, on the steps of his Miami Beach mansion, as he returned from a morning walk on Ocean Drive. It was his custom to take a stroll to a coffee shop that received international periodicals, to read the Italian-language newspapers. He was murdered by Andrew Cunanan, who used the same gun to commit suicide on a boat several days later. Versace's body was cremated and his ashes returned to the family's estate near Cernobbio, Italy.
In September 1997, it was announced Versace's brother, Santo Versace, and Jorge Saud would serve as the new CEOs of Gianni Versace S.P.A. Versace's sister, Donatella, became the new head of design.
In his will, Gianni Versace left 50 percent of his fashion empire to his niece Allegra Versace, daughter of Donatella. Allegra inherited this stake, worth around half a billion dollars, when she turned 18 in 2004. Her younger brother, Daniel, inherited Versace's rare artwork collection.

Variations on a Rococo Theme

Variations on a Rococo Theme is a piece of music for cello and orchestra composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It is one of the most popular pieces of music for cello and orchestra.
Tchaikovsky never composed a cello concerto, but he did write this work, which is a tune with a set of variations. It is called "Rococo" because the music is based on the style that was popular in the late 18th century, the period during the Classical period known as Rococo, the time of composers such as Mozart. The main theme is an original theme by Tchaikovsky, not a theme that had been composed by someone else in the 18th century.
Tchaikovsky wrote this piece for Wilhelm Fitzenhagen to play. He was a German cellist who lived in Russia. Like Tchaikovsky, he was a professor at the Moscow Conservatory. Fitzenhagen gave the first performance of the work in Moscow on 30 November 1877. Nikolai Rubinstein was the conductor. 
What happened to the work after that first performance is an interesting story. Tchaikovsky himself had not been at the first performance because he was in Switzerland trying to calm himself down after a very short, disastrous marriage. He wanted to prepare the work so that it could be published. He sent Fitzhagen a short score (this is similar to an arrangement for the piano). He asked Fitzhagen to make any necessary changes to the cello part. Meanwhile, Tchaikovsky got on with the job of orchestrating the music (showing exactly what is played by each instrument).
However, Fitzhagen did not only make changes to the solo cello part. He made other changes as well. He left one of the variations out, and changed the order of some of the others. When the music was about to be published, Tchaikovsky saw what Fitzhagen had done. Tchaikovsky was very cross, but he decided to let the publishers print it like that anyway.
When it was published there was nothing in the score which said that Fitzhagen had made lots of changes. It was not until about 70 years later that people realized that Tchaikovsky’s original version had been different. Some cellists, such as Steven Isserlis, now choose to play Tchaikovsky’s original version. However, most cellists still prefer to play Fitzhagen’s version. It is hard to tell which one Tchaikovsky would have preferred. Maybe he let it be printed because he realized that Fitzhagen had improved it. We cannot tell. Musicians still argue about which version ought to be played.
The piece is written for an orchestra which is smaller than Tchaikovsky’s usual Romantic orchestral. It is like the ones from the time of Mozart. There are just two of each woodwind instrument, two horns, and strings.
The piece, which is about 20 minutes long, consists of a theme and seven variations (eight in Tchaikovsky's original version).
The work is occasionally played by other solo instruments. Maxim Rysanov plays it on the viola. He played it at the Last Night of the Proms in 2010.

Gravity assist

A gravitational slingshot, gravity assist maneuver or swing-by is the use of the relative movement and gravity of a planet to alter the path and speed of a spacecraft, typically in order to save fuel, time, and expense. Gravity assistance can be used to speed up, slow down and/or change the path of a spacecraft. The "assist" is provided by the motion of the gravitating body as it pulls on the spacecraft.

Heliosphere

The heliosphere is a bubble in space "blown" into the interstellar medium (the hydrogen and helium gas that fill the galaxy) by the solar wind. Although electrically neutral atoms from interstellar volume can pass through this bubble, almost all of the material in the heliosphere comes from the Sun itself. 
For the first ten billion kilometres of its radius, the solar wind travels at over a million kilometres per hour. As it begins to drop out with the interstellar medium, it slows down before finally stopping altogether. The point where the solar wind slows down is the termination shock; the point where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance is called the heliopause; the point where the interstellar medium, travelling in the opposite direction, slows down as it collides with the heliosphere is the bow shock. 
The solar wind is made of particles, charged(ionized) atoms from the solar corona, and fields, in particular magnetic fields. As the Sun rotates once in about 27 days, the magnetic field transported by the solar wind gets wrapped into a spiral. Differences in the Sun's magnetic field are carried outward by the solar wind and can produce magnetic storms in the Earth's magnetosphere.
In March 2005, measurements by the Solar Wind Anisotropies (SWAN) instrument onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) have shown that the heliosphere, the solar wind-filled volume which prevents the solar system from becoming embedded in the local (ambient) interstellar medium, is not axisymmetrical, but is distorted, very likely under the effect of the local galactic magnetic field.

Pakistani nationalism

Pakistani nationalism refers to the political, cultural, linguistic, historical and religious expression of patriotism by people of Pakistan, of pride in the History of Pakistan, Culture of Pakistan, identity and Cultural heritage of Pakistan, and visions for its future.
Most of modern-day Pakistani nationalism is centered around a common Indo-Iranians/Indo-Iranic identity and heritage of 99% of the population. Kashmiris, Sindhis, Balochis, Punjabis, Pashtuns and other minorities are mainly of Indo-Iranic stock. It also refers to the consciousness and expression of religious influences that help mould the national consciousness. Nationalism describes the many underlying forces that moulded the Pakistan Movement, and strongly continue to influence the Politics of Pakistan.
From a political point of view and in the years leading up to the independence of Pakistan, the particular political and ideological foundations for the actions of the Muslim League can be called a Pakistani nationalist ideology. It is a unique and singular combination of philosophical, nationalistic, cultural and religious elements.

Blest Pair of Sirens

Blest Pair of Sirens is a short work for choir and orchestra by Hubert Parry. It was composed in 1887. It is a setting of an ode called "At a solemn Musick" by John Milton.
"Blest Pair of Sirens" was first performed by the Bach Choir conducted by Charles Villiers Stanford. At first Stanford wanted to perform another work by Parry: "The Glories of Our Blood and State". However, the performance was going to be part of Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee celebrations. The words of "The Glories of Our Blood and State" were about Death coming to kings and queens, so it was not thought to be appropriate, and so Stanford asked Parry to write a new work for the occasion. George Grove suggested Milton’s "Ode at a Solemn Music" would be a good poem for Parry to set.
The first performance of "Blest Pair of Sirens" at St James’s Hall took place on 17 May 1887. It is very well written for choir with music that excellently fits Milton’s powerful words. The choir divides into eight parts. The words are about man’s desire to join the heavenly music of the spheres.
"Blest Pair of Sirens" was sung by the choirs of Westminster Abbey and the Chapel Royal at the Royal Wedding of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Kate Middleton on 29 April 2011. It was performed during the signing of the register.

Uruk

Uruk was an ancient city of Sumer and later Babylonia. It was east of the present bed of the Euphrates river, on the ancient dry former channel of the Euphrates River. It was in what is now Iraq.
Uruk gives its name to the Uruk period, the early Chalcolithic to early Bronze Age period in Mesopotamia, about 4000 to 3100 BC. This was followed by the period of Sumer proper. It played a leading role in the early urbanization of Sumer in the mid 4th millennium BC.
At its height c 2900 BC, Uruk probably had 50,000–80,000 residents living in 6 km of walled area. It was the largest city in the world at the time. 
According to the chronology in the Sumerian king list, the semi-mythical king Gilgamesh ruled Uruk in the 27th century BC.
The city lost its prime importance around 2000 BC, after the struggle of Babylonia with Elam. It remained inhabited throughout the Seleucid and Parthian periods until it was finally abandoned during the Sassanid period, just before the Islamic conquest of Mesopotamia.
The site of Uruk was discovered in 1849. The name of lower Mesopotamia, "al-ʿIrāq", is thought to be derived from the name "Uruk".

Wikipedia:Cyberbullying

Cyberbullying is using information and communication technology to cause harm to another person. This is deliberate and is often repeated. This kind of bullying can cause great distress and affect a person's self esteem and confidence. Victims do not feel safe because this can happen anywhere and at anytime, at school, or even in their own homes. Governments around the world are under increasing pressure to do something about the problem. The Simple English Wikipedia does not tolerate cyberbullying at any level, and has strong policies to stop it. "Cyberbullying can have very real, very destructive consequences, and as such should not be underestimated as simple name calling or mistaken as being trivial..."
Cyberbullying is very common among children and teenagers. A US study showed that 58% of children report that someone has said mean or hurtful things to them online. More than four out of ten teenagers say it has happened to them more than once. An Australian study showed that 25% of children report they have been cyber bullied. The US study reported that 53% of children admit having said something mean or hurtful to another person online. More than one in three have done it more than once. A study by Microsoft/Galaxy Research in 2008 reported 21% of children between 10-13 said that they have been cyberbullied, compared to 31% of 14-17 year olds.
Cyberbullying is harmful. It is never funny or amusing to the victim. Incidents that might seem small, or even trivial, may not seem this way to the person being bullied. Immediate action is called for, because these things can quickly grow. Often a bullying comment on the Simple English Wikipedia may be only a part of a much larger, and constant bullying attack.
There have been many reported deaths after young people became so depressed over bullying incidents that they took their own lives. In 2006, a 13 year old girl in Missouri killed herself after receiving mean messages on MySpace from a woman pretending to be a teenage boy. The state of Missouri then made it against the law in Missouri to use technology or text messages to harass someone.
Some bullying, while not identifying an individual to the world, would certainly be seen by the victim who know that they were the target. This includes the "John is fat" type comment. Even if deleted the edit could still be seen in the page history. 
It is a part of our responsibility to make the Simple English Wikipedia safe for our users. We already do a lot of things to make sure it is a safe place. Users also have to take some responsibility to keep themselves safe. Bullying expert Phyllis Kaufman Goldstein recommended several protective steps:
As we target the project at younger users, and also have a large number of younger editors, the project needs to provide a safe environment. Experienced editors often advise new and younger editors to protect their on-line privacy.

<doc id="263501" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=263501" title="Nippur">
Nippur

Nippur, or "Enlil" ('lord wind'), is modern "Nuffar" in Iraq. Nippur was one of the most ancient of all the Sumerian cities. It was the special seat of the worship of the Sumerian god, "Enlil", ruler of the cosmos (universe), and subject to "An" alone.
Nippur was always part of a larger empire. Its control was crucial, as it gave overall 'kingship' to monarchs from other city-states. It was a sacred city, important because it had the famous shrine of "Enlil".
Late in the 3rd millennium BC, Nippur was conquered and occupied by the Semitic rulers of Akkad, and their rulers, like Sargon, left gifts at this sanctuary. Another ruler, Naram-Suen, rebuilt the temple and the city walls; in the debris of this ancient site his remains were found. This Akkadian occupation was succeeded by an occupation during the third dynasty of Ur, and the constructions of Ur-Nammu, the great builder of temples, are on top of those of Naram.
Under the succeeding Kassite dynasty, shortly after the middle of the 2nd millennium, Nippur was restored once more to its former splendour. 
After the middle of the 12th century BC follows a long period of neglect, but after with the conquest of Babylonia by the Assyrian Sargon II, at the close of the 8th century BC, the city revives. Under Ashurbanipal, about the middle of the 7th century BC, we find Ekur restored with a splendour greater than ever before, the ziggurat of that period being 58 by 39 m. 
After that Nippur appears to have gradually fallen into decay, until finally, in the Seleucid period, the ancient temple was turned into a fortress. Huge walls were built at the edges of the ancient terrace, and the courts of the temple were filled with houses and streets. This fortress was occupied and further built upon until the close of the Parthian period, about AD 250.
Under the rule of the Sassanids Nippur fell into decay, and the ancient sanctuary became only a little village of mud huts huddled about the ancient ziggurat. The city was the seat of a Christian diocese as late as the 8th century AD.
Nippur was situated on both sides of the Shatt-en-Nil canal, one of the earliest courses of the Euphrates. It lies between the present bed of that river and the Tigris, almost 160 km southeast of Baghdad. It is divided into two main parts by the dry bed of the old Shatt-en-Nil (Arakhat). The highest point of these ruins, a conical hill rising about 30 m above the level of the surrounding plain, northeast of the canal bed, is called by the Arabs "Bint el-Amiror" ('prince's daughter').
Nippur was first excavated, briefly, by Sir Austen Henry Layard in 1851.
Full scale digging was begun by an expedition from the University of Pennsylvania. The work involved four seasons of excavation between 1889 and 1900. Nippur was also excavated for 19 seasons between 1948 and 1990.

They found a well, part of a defensive town wall, pottery, bricks, and beads made from semi-precious stones. These are said to be about 5,000 years old. Archaeologists were looking for evidence of the Saraswati River, which has disappeared under farmlands. For many years people believed the river was a myth. It is now known that the village of Bhirdana was built on the banks of the river.

Vassily Ivanchuk, born 18 March 1969, is a Ukrainian chess grandmaster.
Chucky, as he is affectionately known, has been a leading player in the world since 1988, at times reaching the second spot on the FIDE list, but has never won the World Chess Championship. Ivanchuk has often had erratic results. Since 2007 his world ranking has ranged from twelfth to second, before dropping to 30th in July 2009.
He was the 2007–2008 World Blitz Chess champion.
He won Amber blindfold and rapid chess championship in 1992 and 2010.
Chucky has been described by Viswanathan Anand as the most eccentric player in the chess world. Anand gave his view on Ivanchuk like this:
When he plays, Ivanchuk rarely looks at the board. Instead he stares at the ceiling and at the walls with a blank stare (although this is not uncommon with top players who calculate without looking at the board). His playing style is unpredictable and highly original, making him a threat to any chess player, although it sometimes also leads to quick losses.
After a string of unsuccessful games culminated in his elimination at the early stages of the 2009 Chess World Cup, Ivanchuk announced, in a highly emotional interview, his retirement from professional chess. However, he soon recanted this decision.

Res Gestae Divi Augusti

Res Gestae Divi Augusti (literally 'The achievements of the divine Augustus'), also known as "Res Gestae" and "RGDA", was an autobiography and epitath written by Emperor Augustus following the tradition of writing about a dead person's achievements and life but Augustus' is the biggest by far. It was about his achievements in his life in politics (his early career), the positions he held and various other parts like the money he spent on Public Games and on rebuilding temples around the empire. Various copies of the "Res Gestae" have been found throughout the Roman Empire. All the surviving copies come from modern-day Turkey - the best preserved one comes from Ancyra. Most historians feel that Augustus wrote several versions during his life and kept updating them until the final version which is usually dated to the same year as Augustus' death in 14 AD.
As a source, the "Res Gestae" is not fully accurate. Whilst not lying, he doesn't mention some things that he did like the proscriptions of his enemies and refers to his rival Marc Antony as 'a faction'. Through the inscription, Augustus makes a big deal of his money he spends on the people, Rome and the empire. He also says frequently that he has 'restored the republic' and only gains his titles because of the universal support from the people and, most importantly, the senate.
The "Res Gestae Divi Augusti" is grouped into four sections:

It cannot be made in the way that potassium permanganate is made because sodium manganate is not made. It can be made by reacting pure manganese(IV) oxide with sodium hypochlorite. It can also be made by reacting potassium permanganate with certain sodium compounds.
It can be used to make circuit boards.
Permanganates are toxic. They are also strong oxidizing agents and should be kept away from things that can burn.

Battle of the Catalaunian Plains

The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains (also called the "Battle of Châlons-sur-Marne" or "Battle of Châlons") was a battle in 451 AD. It took place in Châlons-sur-Marne, in northeast Gaul (nowadays France). Roman legions commanded by Flavius Aetius allied with Visigoth soldiers led by Theodoric I, to defeat the armies of Attila the Hun. 
Attila's armies consisted mainly of horsemen. The battle ended as a stalemate - and thus a victory for the West, the Huns having suffered too many losses to continue their attack. The battle of the Catalaunian Plains crushed Attila's dreams of invading the Roman empire, and ultimately was the end of his empire in Europe. But the battle also weakened the already fragile Western Roman Empire, which collapsed 25 years later, in 476.

Greek fire

Invented by Byzantines, Greek fire was a fearsome weapon. It had the ability to keep burning while on water. As such, it was often used in naval battles. The creation of it was a closely guarded secret and has now been lost.
The term "Greek fire" is normally used in English. However, most other languages use other terms such as "sea fire" (Greek: πῦρ θαλάσσιον), "Roman fire" (πῦρ ῥωμαϊκόν), "war fire" (πολεμικὸν πῦρ), "liquid fire" (ὑγρὸν πῦρ), or "processed fire" (πῦρ σκευαστόν).

Siphonophore

The Siphonophores are an order of Cnidarian invertebrates. The Portuguese man o' war is an example. 
A siphonophore is not a single animal. It is a colony of four kinds of zooids. Zooids are very small, highly modified individuals. All the zooids in a colony are genetically identical. These zooids are specialized polyps and medusoids. 
Though structurally similar to other cnidarians, the zooids do not live by themselves: they are attached to each other. Each type of zooid is not self-sufficient. It depends for survival on the others doing what it cannot do by itself.
So close do the zooids fit together that the colony looks like a single individual. It was a triumph of 19th century biology to discover the real nature of the siphonophores.

Potassium manganate

Potassium manganate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is KMnO. It contains potassium and manganate ions.
Potassium manganate is a green solid. It can disproportionate into potassium permanganate and manganese(IV) oxide. This happens in acidic pH. This reaction, because of its color change, is known as a "chemical chameleon".
It is made by reacting manganese(IV) oxide with very hot potassium hydroxide. Sometimes oxygen or potassium nitrate is used as the oxidizing agent. This makes potassium manganate. Normally the potassium manganate is converted to potassium permanganate. Potassium permanganate is more common. Potassium iodide can reduce potassium permanganate to potassium manganate. It can also be made by reacting hot potassium permanganate with potassium hydroxide. This makes oxygen and potassium manganate.
Potassium manganate does not have many uses. It is mainly made when potassium permanganate is made.
Potassium manganate is a moderate oxidizing agent. When it is reduced, it can made black or brown stains on glass, clothing, or skin.

Immune system

The immune system is the set of tissues which work together to resist infections. The immune mechanisms help an organism identify a pathogen, and neutralize its threat. 
The immune system can detect and identify many different kinds of disease agents. Examples are viruses, bacteria and parasites. The immune system can detect a difference between the body's own healthy cells or tissues, and 'foreign' cells. Detecting an unhealthy intruder is complicated, because intruders can evolve and adapt so that the immune system will no longer detect them.
Once a foreign cell or protein is detected, the immune system creates antibodies to fight the intruders, and sends special cells ('phagocytes') to eat them up.
Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess enzyme systems that protect against viral infections. Other basic immune mechanisms appeared in ancient life forms and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and insects. These mechanisms include antimicrobial peptides (called defensins), phagocytosis, and the complement system. These are the innate immune system, which defends the host from infections in a non-specific way. The simplest innate system is the cell wall or barrier on the outside to stop intruders getting in. For example, skin stops most outside bacteria getting in.
Vertebrates, including humans, have much more sophisticated defense mechanisms. The innate immune system is found in all metazoa, but the adaptive immune system is only found in vertebrates. 
The adaptive immune response gives the vertebrate immune system the ability to "recognize and remember specific pathogens". The system mounts stronger attacks each time the pathogen is encountered. It is adaptive, because the body's immune system prepares itself for future challenges.
The typical vertebrate immune system consists of many types of proteins, cells, organs, and tissues that interact in a complex and ever-changing network. This acquired immunity creates a kind of "immunological memory". 
The process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination. Primary response can take 2 days to 2 weeks to develop. After the body gains immunity towards a certain pathogen, if infection by that pathogen occurs again, the immune response is called the "secondary response".
In some organisms, the immune system has its own problems within itself, called "disorders". These result in other diseases, including autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and possibly even cancer. Immunodeficiency diseases occur when the immune system is less active than normal. Immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic (inherited) disease, or an infection, such as the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), that is caused by the retrovirus HIV, or other causes. 
In contrast, autoimmune diseases result from an immune system that attacks normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, Type 1 diabetes, and Lupus erythematosus.
Immunology is the study of all aspects of the immune system. It is very important to health and diseases.
Immunology is scientific part of medicine that studies the causes of immunity to disease. For many centuries people have noticed that those who recover from some infectious diseases do not get that illness a second time.
In the 18th century, Pierre Louis Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and saw that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom. This and other observations of acquired immunity led to Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) developing vaccination and the germ theory of disease. Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory. It was not until the proofs Robert Koch (1843–1910) published in 1891 (for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905) that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease. Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, when the yellow fever virus was discovered by Walter Reed (1851–1902).
Immunology made a great advance towards the end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of humoral immunity and cellular immunity. Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich (1854–1915), who proposed the side-chain theory to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction. The Nobel Prize for 1908 was jointly awarded to Ehrlich and the founder of cellular immunology, Ilya Mechnikov (1845–1916).
The immune system is extremely ancient, and may go back to single-celled eukaryotes which needed to distinguish between what was food and what was part of themselves.

Sulfur hexafluoride

Sulfur hexafluoride, also known as sulfur(VI) fluoride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SF. It contains sulfur in its +6 oxidation state. It also contains fluoride ions.
Sulfur hexafluoride is a colorless, odorless gas. It is very heavy for a gas (about 5 times heavier than air). It is non reactive, and hard to find anything that reacts with it. It is a strong greenhouse gas. This has made people put some restrictions on using it.
It is made by reacting sulfur with fluorine. That combination also makes toxic disulfur decafluoride, which has to be removed.
It is used in electronics and various electrical devices. It can be used in the body since it is not toxic. It can be used as a test gas to look where gas flows in a heater system, for example. It is detected easily. It is used in some torpedoes. Lithium is one of the only things that reacts with sulfur hexafluoride. Sulfur hexafluoride is sprayed on lithium. This makes the lithium very hot. It creates steam from water and shoots the torpedo. It can be breathed in to make the voice deeper. This is the opposite of breathing in helium gas.
Sulfur hexafluoride is not toxic. It can fill up in closed spaces though. A person may suffocate in the closed space if sulfur hexafluoride has pushed out the oxygen from the space.
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is the most potent greenhouse gas that it has evaluated, with a global warming potential (GWP) of 22,800 times that of when compared over a 100-year period. Measurements of SF show that its global average mixing ratio has increased by about 0.2 ppt per year to over 7 ppt. Sulfur hexafluoride is also extremely long-lived. It is inert in the troposphere and stratosphere. It has an estimated atmospheric lifetime of 800–3200 years. is very stable. (For countries reporting their emissions to the UNFCCC, a GWP of 23,900 for was suggested at the third Conference of the Parties: GWP used in Kyoto protocol). Average global SF concentrations increased by about seven percent per year during the 1980s and 1990s, mostly as the result of its use in the magnesium production industry, and by electrical utilities and electronics manufacturers. Given the low amounts of SF released compared to carbon dioxide, its overall contribution to global warming is estimated to be less than 0.2 percent.
In Europe, falls under the F-Gas directive which ban or control its use in several ways. Since 1 January 2006, is banned as a tracer gas and in all applications except high-voltage switchgear.

Formula One, abbreviated to F1, is a form of open-wheeled auto racing. It is the highest class defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body. The "formula" in the name refers to a set of rules. These rules tell the builders and drivers of the cars what they may and may not do. The F1 world championship season is a series of races. These races are known as Grands Prix. They are usually held on purpose-built circuits. In a few places, they are held on closed city streets. The most famous Grand Prix is the Monaco Grand Prix in Monte Carlo. The top finisher of each race are awarded championship points. The points are added up at the end of they year. There are two yearly Championships. The one for drivers and one for constructors.
Michael Schumacher holds the record for the most Grand Prix victories. He has won 91 times. Alain Prost is second with 51 wins, and Ayrton Senna is third with 41 wins. Michael Schumacher also has the longest time between his first win and his last.

Paridae

The Paridae is a family of tiny birds, the tits (called 'chickadees' or 'titmice' in North America). They are passerine songbirds which are native to the northern hemisphere and Africa. Most of them used to be classified in the genus "Parus", which has now been split up.
These birds are mainly small stocky woodland species with short stout bills. Some have crests. They range in length from 10 to 22 centimetres. They are adaptable birds, with a mixed diet including seeds and insects. 
Many species will live around human habitation and come readily to bird feeders for nuts or seed, and learn to take other foods. In Britain, Great Tits and Blue Tits learned to break through the foil caps sealing bottles of milk on doorsteps, to get at the cream on top. Of course, the change in milk packaging has robbed them of this delicacy.
These are hole-nesting birds, typically using trees, although some species build nests on the ground. They lay anything from three to nineteen speckled white eggs, depending on species.
The tits are active, noisy, social birds. They are territorial during the breeding season. The tits are highly adaptable and, after the corvids (crows and jays) and parrots, amongst the most intelligent of all birds.
The tits make a variety of calls and songs. They are amongst the most vocal of all birds, calling continuously and loudly. They are only ever silent for reasons such as avoiding predators or when intruding on a rival's territory. Quiet calls are made while feeding to keep contact with others in their social group. Other calls are used for signalling alarm—the most famous of which is the "Chic-a-dee-dee" of North American species in the genus "Poecile". The call also serves a rallying call to summon others to mob and harass the predator. It has been demonstrated through experiments that the number of "dee" syllables at the end of the call increases with the level of danger the predator poses.
The tits are insectivorous, and eat a wide range of small insects and other invertebrates, particularly small leaf-eating caterpillars. They also eat seeds and nuts, especially in winter. A typical activity is "hanging", where they inspect a branch or twig and leaves from all angles while hanging upside down to feed. 
In areas with several species of tit, the different species will forage (search) in different parts of a tree. Larger species forage on the ground, medium sized species forage on larger branches, and the smallest species on the ends of branches. If they get larger prey or seeds tits will engage in 'hold-hammering'. They hold the item with one foot, and hammer it with the bill until it is open. In this way they can open hazelnuts in 20 minutes. A number of genera engage in food caching, hoarding supplies of food during the winter. These caches are usually of seeds but may be of insects.

Mary Quant

Mary Quant OBE (born 11 February 1934 in Blackheath, London) is a British fashion designer. In 1963, she won the "Sunday Times" International Fashion Award, and was chosen as "Woman of the Year". 
Quant was famous as a designer who invented the miniskirt and hot pants. She was also instrumental in the mod fashion movement, and known for her use of pop art in fashion.
Born to Welsh parents, Quant went to Blackheath High School, then studied illustration at Goldsmiths College. Her first employment was as a couture milliner (hat maker). 
In November 1955, she teamed up with her husband, Alexander Plunket Greene, and a former solicitor, Archie McNair, to open a clothes shop on the Kings Road in Chelsea called Bazaar. Bazaar's best sellers were small white plastic collars to brighten up black dresses or t-shirts. Black stretch stockings were also popular.
Skirts had been getting shorter since about 1958 – a development Mary Quant thought was practical and liberating, allowing women to run for a bus. The miniskirt, which she is most famous for, became one of the defining fashions of the 1960s. The miniskirt was also developed separately by André Courrèges and John Bates, and there is disagreement as to who came up with the idea first. Like most fashion, the short- and ever-shorter skirt was evolving already among fashion-minded young women: the designers who adapted it just helped spread the style and, in Quant's case, gave it a name. Mary Quant named the miniskirt after her favourite make of car, the Mini. She loved the car so much, she had one designed especially for her.
Quant's first collection of underwear was designed to be worn with the miniskirt look. She renamed the basics "booby traps and bacon savers" (bras and tights), which appealed to her young customers. 
In addition to the miniskirt, Mary Quant is often credited with inventing the coloured and patterned tights (pantyhose) that often went with the miniskirt. These are also attributed to Cristobal Balenciaga or John Bates. 
Tights worn over briefs or bikini panties were an essential accessory to the miniskirt, because the older method of stockings plus suspenders was no longer suitable, and legs need to be covered for most of the year in Britain. Often there would be a second pair of coloured short pants on top of the tights, for show. A range of materials and colours were used for the tights.
In the late 1960s, Quant popularised hot pants. Through the 1970s and 1980s she concentrated on household goods and make-up, rather than just her clothing lines. At a talk at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2007 she claimed to have invented duvet covers.
She is a Fellow of the Chartered Society of Designers, and winner of the "Minerva Medal", the Society's highest award. In 1963 Quant was the first winner of the 'Dress of the Year' award.
In 2000 she resigned as director of "Mary Quant Ltd.", her cosmetics company, after a Japanese buy-out. There are over 200 Mary Quant Colour shops in Japan, where Quant fashions continue to enjoy popularity.

Hannibal Alkhas

Hannibal Alkhas (1930 – 2010) was a sculptor, painter and author. He was born in 1930 in Iran into an ethnic Assyrian and Christian family and spent his childhood and teenage years in Kermanshah, Ahwaz and Tehran. In 1951, Hannibal Alkhas moved to the United States in pursuit of his education and studied philosophy for three years at Loyola University of Chicago, Illinois.
From 1953 to 1958 he attended the Art Institute of Chicago where he earned his Bachelor's and Masters of Fine Arts.
In 1959, after the death of his father, the famous Assyrian writer Rabi Adai Alkhas, Hannibal Alkhas returned to Iran and began to teach painting, drawing, and art history at the Tehran School of Fine Arts for the next four years. During this time he established the successful "Gilgamesh gallery", the first modern art gallery in Iran where aspiring young artists were introduced.
In 1963 he returned to the United States and taught a Monticello College in Illinois where he became the chairman of the art department.
In 1969 Hannibal again returned to Iran and spent the next eleven (11) years teaching at Tehran University [6].
He taught at Islamic Azad University in Iran.
Hannibal Alkhas has also created book illustrations, written poems and translated many poems to and from Assyrian. His works have been displayed in numerous exhibitions in Iran, Europe, Canada, Australia and the US.
Hannibal Alkhas died on September 14, 2010 at the age of 80 in the United States. He was suffering from cancer.

Blue tit

The blue tit, "Cyanistes caeruleus", is a passerine songbird in the family Paridae. It is 10.5 to 12 cm (4.2 to 4.8 inches) long. 
The blue tit is a widespread and common resident breeder. It lives throughout temperate and subarctic Europe and western Asia in deciduous or mixed woodlands. It is a resident bird; most do not migrate.
Blue and great tits form mixed winter flocks, and the former are perhaps the better gymnasts on the slender twigs. A blue tit will often ascend a trunk in short jerky hops, imitating a treecreeper. As a rule the bird roosts in ivy or evergreens, but in hard weather will shelter in a hole. Blue tits are very agile and can hang from almost anywhere.
The blue tit has an average life expectancy of 1.5 years 
The blue tit is a destroyer of pests. It is fond of young buds of various trees, and may pull them to bits in the hope of finding insects. No species, however, destroys more coccids and aphids, the worst foes of many plants. It also eats leaf miner grubs and green tortrix moths (Tortricidae). Seeds are eaten, as with all this family.
An interesting example of culturally transmitted learning in birds was the phenomenon dating from the 1960s of blue tits teaching one another how to open traditional British milk bottles with foil tops, to get at the cream underneath. This behaviour has declined recently because of the replacement of doorstep delivery by supermarket purchases of milk, and by hard-topped containers instead of the old bottles.

Crow

Crows form the genus Corvus in the family Corvidae. They are medium to large sized birds, carnivores and scavengers.
The genus includes the crow (carrion crow or hooded crow), the rook, jay, jackdaw, the magpie and the large common raven. The genus has 40 or so members on all temperate continents except for South America, and some islands. 
The "Corvus" makes up a third of the species in the Corvidae. Crows appear to have evolved in Asia from corvid stock which had evolved in Australia. The collective name for a group of crows is a "flock" or, more poetically, a "murder".
Some crow species not only use tools but also make tools. Crows are now thought to be, with parrots, among the world's most intelligent birds. 
They have a brain size (adjusted for body size) as large as some apes. The jackdaw and the European magpie have a "nidopallium" about the same relative size as the equivalent neocortex in chimpanzees, and significantly larger than is found in the gibbon.
A story of how a girl fed crows, and in return they brought her tiny gifts, shows what the birds are capable of.

Silver nitrate

Silver nitrate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is AgNO. It contains silver in its +1 oxidation state as an ion. It also has nitrate.
Silver nitrate is a colorless crystalline solid. It dissolves in water. Most silver compounds do not dissolve in water. It can get dark if light shines on it. It is an oxidizing agent. Most of the times the silver ion is reduced, but sometimes the nitrate ion is reduced. It reacts with copper to make silver crystals and copper(II) nitrate. It turns into silver, nitrogen dioxide, and oxygen when it is heated. It is the least expensive silver compound. It reacts with bases to make dark brown silver(I) oxide.
It is made by dissolving silver in nitric acid. This produces nitrogen dioxide, so it should be done where the person can get fresh air.
It was used to separate silver and gold. Gold does not dissolve in nitric acid. It is used to make other silver compounds. It reacts with chloride, bromide, and iodides to make white, cream, and yellow-colored solids. It is also used as an oxidizing agent. It can also be used to kill germs. 
Silver nitrate is an oxidizing agent and should be kept away from chemicals that can burn. It can burn and stain skin. If too much is eaten, it can turn the skin blue.

<doc id="263865" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=263865" title="Smokey Bear">
Smokey Bear

Smokey Bear (also sometimes called Smokey the Bear) is a mascot of the United States Forest Service. He was made to teach people that forest fires are dangerous and how people can prevent them. An advertising campaign featuring Smokey was started in 1944 with the slogan, "Smokey Says – Care Will Prevent 9 out of 10 Forest Fires". Smokey Bear's later slogan, "Remember... Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires", was made in 1947 by the Ad Council. In April 2001, the message was changed to "Only You Can Prevent Wildfires". According to the Ad Council, Smokey Bear and his message are recognized by 95% of adults and 77% of children in the U.S.
Smokey's correct name is Smokey Bear. In 1952, the songwriters Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins made a famous song named "Smokey the Bear". The pair said that "the" was added to Smokey's name to keep the song's rhythm. This small change has made people confused ever since. Smokey's name is spelled differently from the word "smoky" on purpose. 
The fictional character Smokey Bear is run by three groups: the United States Forest Service, the National Association of State Foresters, and the Ad Council. Smokey Bear's name and image are protected by U.S. federal law, the "Smokey Bear Act of 1952" (16 U.S.C. 580 (p-2); 18 U.S.C. 711).
Though the US Forest Service fought wildfires long before World War II, the war made doing it even more important. The forest service began using colorful posters to teach Americans about the dangers of forest fires. Since most physically fit men who were able to already were serving in the armed forces, there were few people who could stay back and put them out as a job. The hope was that local communities, educated about the danger of forest fires, could prevent them from starting in the first place. However, Japan saw wildfires as a possible weapon. Forest fires could waste the time of people in the United States who could otherwise be involved in the war. They could also destroy natural resources.
The government made advertisements about fire safety. It decided to use a bear in the advertisement. The bear was named "Smokey" after "Smokey" Joe Martin, a New York City Fire Department hero who suffered burns and blindness during a brave 1922 rescue. 
Smokey's first poster was released on August 9, 1944. It was drawn by Albert Staehle. In the poster, Smokey was wearing jeans and a "forest ranger's hat" (a campaign hat), pouring a bucket of water on a campfire. The message underneath reads, "Smokey says – Care will prevent 9 out of 10 forest fires!" 
Knickerbocker Bears got a license to make Smokey bear dolls in 1944. 
Also in 1944, Forest Service worker Rudy Wendelin became the full time campaign artist; he was considered Smokey Bear's "caretaker" until he retired in 1973.
In 1947, the saying now associated with Smokey Bear was first said: "Remember...only YOU can prevent forest fires."
The living symbol of Smokey Bear was an American black bear who, in the spring of 1950, was caught in the Capitan Gap fire, a wildfire that burned in the Capitan Mountains of New Mexico. The cub was in the Lincoln National Forest. Smokey had climbed a tree to get away from the fire, but his paws and hind legs had been burned. He was rescued by a game warden after the fire.
At first, he was called "Hotfoot Teddy," but he was later renamed Smokey, after the mascot. A local rancher who had been helping fight the fire took the cub home with him, but he needed care from a veterinarian. New Mexico Department of Game and Fish Ranger Ray Bell took him to Santa Fe. His wife, Ruth, and their children, Don and Judy, took care of the cub. News services around the country wrote stories about the cub, and he became famous. Soon after, Smokey was flown in a Piper Cub airplane to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., where he lived for 26 years. After he died on November 9, 1976, Smokey's remains were returned by the government to Capitan, New Mexico, and buried at what is now the Smokey Bear Historical Park.
The character became a big part of American popular culture in the 1950s. He appeared on radio programs, in comic strips and in cartoons.
In 1952, Congress passed the Smokey Bear Act, an act of Congress, was passed to remove the character from the public domain and place it under the control of the Secretary of Agriculture. This meant that people had to have permission from the government to use pictures of Smokey.
In the 1960s, so many people wanted to write letters to Smokey that the US Postal Service issued him his own ZIP Code. That code is 20252. Parts of those letters have been published online.
In 2004, Smokey's 60th anniversary was celebrated. According to Richard Earle, author of "The Art of Cause Marketing", the Smokey Bear campaign is recognized one of the most powerful and lasting of all public service advertising. "Smokey is simple, strong, straightforward," Earle writes. "He's a denizen of those woods you're visiting, and he cares about preserving them. Anyone who grew up watching "Bambi" realizes how terrifying a forest fire can be. But Smokey wouldn't run away. Smokey's strong. He'll stay and fight the fire if necessary, but he'd rather have you douse it and cover it up so he doesn't have to."
In 2009, new commercials with Smokey made in CGI came out.

Katrina cottage

Katrina cottages are small houses designed and marketed in the United States in the wake of Hurricane Katrina (August 2005). They were designed as a response to the inadequacies of the trailers issued to flood victims by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The homes are designed to attempt to fulfill the needs of their occupants in a more permanent and weather-resistant manner, while addressing the challenges of building and protecting a home in the Gulf Coast region. Some of the homes are elevated, on stilts, particularly in southern Louisiana and Mississippi, where much of the land currently used is near sea level, protected by levees, or prone to flooding by nearby rivers or coastal storm surges or high tides.
Though designs differ somewhat, the main factor for appearance is that Katrina cottages look like traditional homes in the area, reduced in size to lower costs and ease construction so that multiple units can be built quickly as needed. The Katrina cottages are usually one-bedroom, shotgun-house designs, with a front porch that helps stabilize the house from strong winds. Hence, they tend to be smaller than many house trailers, which have 2 or 3 bedrooms (as in a double wide trailer); however, the cottages are constructed of heavier materials to resist winds that would buckle the light-weight walls of mobile homes.
The best-known of these designs are those by Marianne Cusato, whose original "Katrina Cottage" made the term popular and received in 2006 the first annual People's Design Award from the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of the U.S. Smithsonian Institution. As Cusato's design and others gained increasing media attention, the number of designs has increased. The home-improvement retailer Lowe's offers pre-packaged Katrina Cottage kits, including plans and all materials needed for construction. A Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) pilot program accommodating 900 Mississippi coast families encountered some opposition from local government officials opposed to permanent small housing units, although Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour urged local officials to accept the cottages as safer than trailers, in high winds or moderate floods.

Drosera regia

Drosera regia, also known as the King sundew, is a carnivorous plant of the sundew family. In the wild, it only grows in two places in a single valley in South Africa. Its leaves can grow to a size of 70 cm in length. It also has features which are not found in many other sundews, such as wooded rhizomes and special covered pollen. These features have been combined with a genetic analysis, and it was found that "D. regia" is among the older species of sundew. The Venus Flytrap, another carnivorous plant, shares some of the features, which suggests a close relationship between the two. 
The leaves of the plant are covered with tentacles. They are able to capture large prey, such as beetles, moths and butterflies. The tentacles of all "Drosera" species are specialized glands, capable of producing sticky mucus. The leaves are active flypaper traps: they capture prey by surrounding it. In its native habitat, the plants compete for space with native marsh grasses and low evergreen shrubs. There are two known populations of the plant in the wild. The higher-altitude site is overgrown, and "D. regia" no longer grows there. On the lower-altitude site, there are about 50 mature plants. For this reason, "D. regia" is the most endangered "Drosera" species, since it is threatened with extinction in the wild. It is often grown by people who like carnivorous plants and a single cultivar, "Big Easy", has been registered.

<doc id="263971" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=263971" title="Traction motor">
Traction motor

Traction motor refers to a type of electric motor. A traction motor is used to make rotation torque on a machine. It is usually changed into a straight line motion.
Traction motors are used in electrically powered rail vehicles such as electric multiple units and electric locomotives. They are also used in electric vehicles, such as electric milk floats, elevators, and conveyors. Vehicles with electrical transmission systems such as Diesel-electric locomotives, electric hybrid vehicles and battery powered electric vehicles. 
Railroad first used DC motors. These motors usually ran on about 600 volts. High-powered semiconductors were developed to control the switching of AC motors. They have made AC induction motors a better choice. An induction motor does not require contacts inside the motor. These AC motors are simpler, and more reliable than the old DC motors. AC induction motors known as "asynchronous traction motors". 
Before the mid-20th century, a single large motor was often used to drive multiple wheels through connecting rods. This was the same way that steam locomotives would turn their drive wheels. Now, the normal practice is to use one traction motor to drive each axle through a gear drive.
Usually, the traction motor is mounted between the wheel frame and the driven axle. This is called a "nose-suspended traction motor". The problem with this mounting is that some of the motor's weight is on the axle. This causes the track and frame to wear out faster. The "Bi-Polar" electric locomotives built by General Electric for the Milwaukee Road had direct drive motors. The rotating shaft of the motor was also the axle for the wheels. 
The DC motor is made in two parts; the "rotating armature" and the "fixed field windings". The field windings, also called the "stator", surrounds the armature. The field windings are made of tightly wound coils of wire inside the motor case. The armature, also called the "rotor", is another set of coils of wire wound round the central shaft. The armature is connected to the field windings through "brushes". The brushes are spring loaded contacts pressing against the "commutator". The commutator sends the electricity in a circular pattern to armature windings. A "series-wound" motor has the armature and the field windings connected in series. A series-wound DC motor has a low electrical resistance. When voltage is applied to the motor, it makes a strong magnetic field inside the motor. This produces a high amount of torque, so it is good for starting a train. If more current than needed is sent to the motor, there would be too much torque and the wheels would spin. If too much current is sent to the motor, it could damage the motor. Resistors are used to limit the current when the motor starts.
As the DC motor starts to turn, the magnetic fields inside start to join together. They create an internal voltage. This electromagnetic force (EMF) works against the voltage sent to the motor. The EMF controls the current flow in the motor. As the motor speeds up, the EMF falls. Less current flows into the motor, and it makes less torque. The motor will stop increasing its speed when the torque matches (is the same as) the drag on the train. To accelerate the train, more voltage must be sent to the motor. One or more resistors are removed to increase the voltage. This will increase the current. The torque will increase, and so will the speed of the train. When no resistors are left in the circuit, full line voltage is applied directly to the motor. 
On an electric train, the train driver originally had to control the speed by changing the resistance manually. By 1914, automatic acceleration was being used. This was achieved by an accelerating relay in the motor circuit. This was often called a "notching relay". The relay would watch the fall of current and control the resistance. All the driver had to do was select low, medium or full speed. These speeds are called "shunt", "series" and "parallel" from the way the motors were wired.
Traditionally road vehicles (cars, buses and trucks) have used diesel or gasoline engines with a transmission. In the latter part of the 20th century, vehicles with electrical transmission systems began to be developed. These vehicles have a source of electricity from batteries or fuel cells. They may also be powered by an internal combustion engines. 
A benefit from using electric motors is that some types can generate energy. They act as a dynamo during braking. This helps improve the efficiency of the vehicle.
Because of the high power levels used by traction motors, they create a lot of heat. They usually require cooling, often with forced air.

Wikipedia:Advanced article editing

This essay, Wikipedia:Advanced article editing describes some techniques to improve editing (changing the text) of Wikipedia articles. Most of the tips involve using typical browser settings, or use of standard text-editors. While some special software packages exist, to allow customized editing, they are typically not available when travelling to other computers for wiki-editing.
The Wikipedia article-edit window is not designed for side-by-side editing: instead, the formatted preview-article is usually on the top-half the page and the edit-buffer is typically far below (near page bottom). By the time various text-issues are noticed, the user often forgets where they occurred within the edit-buffer, far away. However, when using 2 windows for side-by-side editing, the text (or image) is noticed in one window and located/changed in the other window, thereby allowing numerous, precise changes to be made 2x to 10x times (or more) faster, without forgetting the tedious details.
The potential increase in productivity, using side-by-side as a new way of arranging edits, is almost a magical breakthrough in the ability to easily improve hundreds of scattered details. It is even more powerful than a WYSIWYG editor, for 4 reasons: (1) it allows users to even see/edit the underlying tables or infobox markup-language, before becoming distracted by a wholly reformatted page; (2) the editing can continue while the preview-page is being formatted/displayed in the 2nd window; (3) results do not demand verification; and (4) the diff-listing can remind users about all edits. Specifically:
Quick editing is not just about fast edit/response feedback, but also about avoiding or limiting either distractions, or forced verification steps, as well. Being quicker, long-term, could depend on spotting edit-problems by using diff-listings in the 2nd window, while further editing continues in the 1st window.
Even a simple text-editor, such as Microsoft Notepad, can be used to handle some complex changes, by using multiple find-and-replace text string-substitutions. For example, 2 edit-commands could be used to add quotation marks around wikilinks (hyperlinks):
For wikilinks that already had quotation marks, then replace all double-quote patterns ("") with a single quotation mark.
For several years, there has been a free text-editor, called "Notetab", that allows using highly complex regular expressions to find, replace or swap multiple text-patterns on each line of a page. The free version of Notetab is a simplified version of the commercial-product version, and allows many sophisticated features, without having to buy the full-feature version. Notetab can also be used to count words or particular phrases within a page. For more, see the features described at: Notetab.
Perhaps in the very far future, a Wikipedia edit-window will have some type of side-by-side display, allowing a scrolling area for formatted output. However, due to the complexity of simulating a formatted-page in a scrolling region, it would probably be many years (over 5 = 2014+) before such, side-by-side, editing could be implemented in a single browser page.
Multi-screen computers, as common decades ago, are expected to become common again (some year) when today's limited computer technology progresses beyond the current "dark age of computing" (how many decades of computer viruses?). There are many intelligent people in the world, and once software monopolies quit promoting bad technology, then computers can quickly improve. Many people really are much smarter than those software companies of the Dark Ages. In fact, hypertext interfaces existed in the 1960s, but numerous complications have thwarted advances, such as possibly supporting search-engine "multi-word" scanning of "any" document in viewing or text-editing. When computers with multiple screens become more common, then side-by-side editing could become even easier.

Ohm

There are some materials which offer some resistance to the current flow, they are called resistive materials, for example graphite, iron, and certain synthetic materials.
The magnitude that represents this characteristic is the resistance, and it is measured in ohms. An ohm (referred to by the Greek letter Ω (Omega)) is the SI unit of resistance (R). It can be defined by Ohm's law and the equation: 
where formula_2 is resistance in ohms, formula_3 is voltage in volts, and formula_4 the current in amperes.
The ohm was named after Georg Ohm.

Quotation mark

Quotation marks or inverted commas (informally known as quotes and speech marks) are punctuation marks used in pairs to mark a section of text as speech, a quotation, a phrase, or an unusual word. They are used in groups of 2, as a pair of opening and closing marks. They are used in either of two forms: or .
Depending on the typeface, the opening and closing quotation marks may be identical in form (called "vertical" or "straight" or "typewriter" quotation marks), or they may be distinctly left-handed and right-handed ("typographic" or, colloquially, "curly" quotation marks). The closing single quotation mark is identical or similar in form to the apostrophe, and similar to the prime symbol. However, these three characters have quite different purposes. See also: ditto mark.
Quotation marks show that part of the text is either a person speaking or a quotation. Double quotation marks are used as a rule in the United States, while both single and double quotation marks are used in the United Kingdom and other commonwealth countries. A publisher's or author's style can be considered as more important than national preferences. However, the style of opening and closing quotation marks must be matched:
For speech within speech, the other mark is used for inner quotations, within a quotation:
Sometimes, quotations are nested in more than two levels. Nesting levels up to five can be found in some translations of the Bible. In these cases, questions arise about the form (and names) of the quotation marks to be used. The most common way is to simply alternate between the two forms, thus:
If such a passage is further quoted in another publication, then all of their forms have to be shifted over by one level.
In most cases, quotations which span multiple paragraphs should be set as block quotations, and thus do not require quotation marks. Quotation marks are used for multiple-paragraph quotations in some cases, especially in narratives. The convention in English is to put an opening quotation mark at the first and each subsequent paragraph, but use a closing quotation mark only for the final paragraph of the quotation, as in the following example from the book "Pride and Prejudice":
As noted below, in some older texts, the quotation mark is repeated every line, rather than every paragraph. The Spanish convention uses closing quotation marks at the beginning of all subsequent paragraphs beyond the first.
When quoted text is interrupted, such as with the phrase "he said," a closing quotation mark is used before the interruption, and an opening quotation mark after. Commas are also often used before and after the interruption, more often for quotations of speech than for quotations of text:
It is incorrect to use quotation marks for paraphrased speech. This is because a paraphrase is an indirect quote, and in the course of any composition, it is important to document when one is using a quotation versus when one is using a paraphrased idea.
If HAL says: “All systems are functional,” then:
However, another convention when quoting text in the body of a paragraph or sentence—for example, in an essay—is to recognize double quotation marks as marking an exact quotation, and single quotation marks as marking a paraphrased quotation or a quotation where grammar, pronouns, or plurality have been changed in order to fit the sentence containing the quotation (see reported speech).
Another common use of quotation marks is to indicate or call attention to ironic or mis-used words:
Quotes indicating irony, or other special use, are sometimes called scare quotes. They are sometimes gestured in oral speech using air quotes.
Quotation marks are also used to indicate that the writer realizes that a word is not being used in its current commonly accepted sense.
In addition to conveying a neutral attitude and to call attention to a neologism, or slang, or special terminology (also known as jargon), quoting can also indicate words or phrases that are "descriptive" but unusual, colloquial, folksy, startling, humorous, metaphoric, or contain a pun:
Dawkins’s concept of a meme could be described as an “evolving idea”.
People also use quotation marks in this way to:
The "Chicago Manual of Style" (CMS), 15th edition acknowledges this type of use but cautions against overuse in section 7.58, “Quotation marks are often used to alert readers that a term is used in a nonstandard, ironic, or other special sense […] They imply ‘This is not my term,’ or ‘This is not how the term is "usually" applied.’ Like any such device, scare quotes lose their force and irritate readers if overused.”
Using either quotation marks or italics can emphasize that an instance of a word refers to the word itself, rather than its associated concept.
A three-way distinction is occasionally made between normal use of a word (no quotation marks), referring to the concept behind the word (single quotation marks), and the word itself (double quotation marks):
The logic, for this form, derives from the need to distinguish use forms, coupled with the mandate to retain consistent notation for like use forms. The switching between double and single quotes in nested citation quotes reveals the same literary device for reducing ambiguity.
Books about language often use italics for the word itself and single quotation marks for a gloss:
In common usage, there may be a distinction between the single and double quotation marks in this context; often, single quotation marks are used to embrace single characters, while double quotation marks enclose whole words or phrases:
The two may, however, in these cases, be to some degree interchangeable.
Quotation marks, rather than italics, are generally used for the titles of shorter works. Whether these are single or double is again a matter of style; however, many styles, especially for poetry, prefer the use of single quotation marks.
As a rule, a whole publication would be italicised, whereas the titles of minor works (such as poems or short stories inside the collection) would be written with quotation marks.
Quotation marks can also offset a nickname embedded in an actual name, or a false or ironic title embedded in an actual title; for example, Nat "King" Cole, Miles "Tails" Prower, or John “Hannibal” Smith.
Quotes are sometimes used incorrectly for emphasis in lieu of underlining or italics, most commonly on signs or placards. This usage can be confused with ironic or altered-usage quotation, sometimes with unintended humor. For example, "For sale: "fresh" fish, "fresh" oysters", could be construed to imply that "fresh" is not used with its everyday meaning, or indeed to indicate that the fish or oysters are anything but fresh. And again, "Cashiers’ desks open until noon for your “convenience”" might mean that the convenience was for the bank employees, not the customers.
With regard to quotation marks adjacent to periods and commas, there are two styles of punctuation in widespread use. While these two styles are most commonly referred to as “American” and “British” (and some style sheets provide no other name), some American writers and organizations use the “British” style and vice versa. Both systems have the same rules regarding question marks, exclamation points, colons and semicolons. They differ on the treatment of periods and commas.
In the U.S., the standard style is called American style, typesetters’ rules, printers’ rules, typographical usage, or traditional punctuation, whereby commas and periods are almost always placed inside closing quotation marks. 
This style of punctuation is common in the U.S., Canada, and in the U.K. in fiction and journalism.
The other standard style–called British style or logical punctuation–is to include within quotation marks only those punctuation marks that appeared in the quoted material, but otherwise to place punctuation outside the closing quotation marks.
When dealing with words-as-words, short-form works and sentence fragments, the styles differ:
When dealing with direct speech, American rules place periods and commas inside the quotation marks all the time, but the alternative usage varies. In fiction, both styles are the same. In non-fiction, British publishers may permit placing punctuation that is not part of the person’s speech inside the quotation marks but prefer that it be placed outside. According to the "Cambridge Handbook for Editors, Copy-editors and Proofreaders", periods and commas that "are" part of the person’s speech are permitted inside the quotation marks regardless.
Many American style guides explicitly permit periods and commas outside the quotation marks when the presence of the punctuation mark inside the quotation marks will lead to ambiguity, such as when describing keyboard input:
In all major forms of English, question marks and exclamation marks are placed inside or outside quoted material depending on whether they apply to the whole sentence or just the quoted portion, but colons and semicolons are always placed outside.
In the first two sentences above, only one punctuation mark is used at the end of each. Regardless of its placement, only one end mark (?, !, or .) can end a sentence in American English. Only the period, however, "cannot" end a quoted sentence when it does not also end the enclosing sentence, except for literal text:
References: "Chicago Manual of Style", 15th edition; "Hart's Rules for Compositors and Readers at the University Press, Oxford"; "Merriam-Webster's Guide to Punctuation and Style", second edition.
In English, when a quotation follows other writing on a line of text, a space precedes the opening quotation mark unless the preceding symbol, such as a dash, requires that there be no space. When a quotation is followed by other writing on a line of text, a space follows the closing quotation mark unless it is immediately followed by other punctuation within the sentence, such as a colon or closing punctuation. (These exceptions are ignored by some Asian computer systems that systematically display quotation marks with the included spacing, as this spacing is part of the fixed-width characters.)
There is generally no space between an opening quotation mark and the following word, or a closing quotation mark and the preceding word. When a double quotation mark or a single quotation mark immediately follows the other, proper spacing for legibility requires that a non-breaking space be inserted.
Straight quotation marks (or italicized straight quotation marks) are often used to approximate the prime and double prime, e. g., when signifying feet and inches, arcminutes and arcseconds or minutes and seconds, where the quotation mark symbolises the latter part of the pair. For instance, 5 feet and 6 inches is often written 5' 6", and 40 degrees, 20 arcminutes, and 50 arcseconds is written 40° 20' 50". When available, however, the prime should be used instead (e. g., 5′ 6″, and 40° 20′ 50″). Prime and double prime are not present in most character sets, including ASCII and Latin-1, but are present in Unicode, as characters U+2032 (dec. 8242) and U+2033 (dec. 8243), and as HTML entities &prime; and &Prime;. Double quotation marks are also often used to represent the ditto mark.
Straight single and double quotation marks are used in most programming languages to delimit strings or literal characters. In some languages (e. g. Pascal) only one type is allowed, in some (e. g. C and its derivatives) both are used with different meanings and in others (e. g. Python) both are used interchangeably. In some languages, if it is desired to include the same quotation marks used to delimit a string inside the string, the quotation marks are doubled. For example, to represent the string eat 'hot' dogs in Pascal one uses 'eat "hot" dogs'. Other languages use an escape character, often the backslash, as in 'eat \'hot\' dogs'.
Standard English computer keyboard layouts inherited the single and double “straight” quotation marks from the typewriter (the single quotation mark also doubling as an apostrophe), and they do not include individual keys for left-handed and right-handed typographic quotation marks. However, most computer text-editing programs provide a “smart quotes” feature (see below) to automatically convert “straight” quote marks into typographic punctuation. Generally, this “smart quote” feature is enabled by default. Some websites do not allow typographic quotation marks or apostrophes in posts (one such example being YouTube). One can skirt these limitations, however, by using the HTML character codes or entities.
To make typographic quotation marks easier to enter, publishing software often automatically converts typewriter quotation marks (and apostrophes) to typographic form during text entry (with or without the user being aware of it). This is known as the "smart quotes" feature. Quotation marks that are not automatically altered by computer programs are known as "dumb quotes". Some implementations incorrectly produce an opening single quotation mark in places where an apostrophe is required, for example, in abbreviated years like "’08" for "2008".
In the first centuries of typesetting, quotations were distinguished merely by indicating the speaker, and this can still be seen in some editions of the Bible. During the Renaissance, quotations were distinguished by setting in a typeface contrasting with the main body text (often Italic type with roman, or the other way round). Long quotations were also set this way, at full size and full measure.
Quotation marks were first cut in metal type during the middle of the sixteenth century, and were used copiously by some printers by the seventeenth. In some Baroque and Romantic-period books, they would be repeated at the beginning of every line of a long quotation. When this practice was abandoned, the empty margin remained, leaving the modern form of indented block quotation.
In Early Modern English, quotation marks were used only to denote pithy comments. They first began to quote direct speech in 1714. By 1749 single quotation marks, or inverted commas, were commonly used to denote direct speech.

Haute couture

Haute couture (pronounced '') is a French term for high fashion. It refers to the creation of exclusive custom-fitted clothing. The term refers to: 
"Haute couture" is made to order for a specific customer. It is usually made from high-quality, expensive fabric and sewn with extreme attention to detail and finish by the most experienced and capable seamstresses, often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques. "Couture" is a common abbreviation of "haute couture".
In France, "haute couture" is "une appellation juridiquement protégée" (a legally protected name). It may only be used by firms which meet certain well-defined standards. However, the term is also used to describe all high-fashion custom-fitted clothing in other 'fashion capitals' such as Milan, London, New York, Tokyo and Madrid. 
The "couturier" Charles Frederick Worth (13 October 1826–10 March 1895), is widely considered the father of "haute couture" as it is known today. Although born in Lincolnshire, England, Worth made his mark in the French fashion industry. He revolutionized how dressmaking was organised. Worth made it so the dressmaker became an "artist": a fashion designer. He created one-of-a-kind designs to please his titled or rich customers. More importantly, he prepared designs which were shown on live models at the "House of Worth". Clients selected a design, specified colours and fabrics, and had a version tailor-made in Worth's workshop. Worth combined individual tailoring with a standardization more characteristic of the ready-to-wear clothing industry, which was also developing during this period.
To earn the right to call itself a couture house and to use the term "haute couture", members of the "Chambre syndicale de la haute couture" must follow these rules:
Membership is seldom given. Outside the "Chambre syndicale" are many successful fashion houses which deal in "prêt-à-porter" (the French term for ready-to-wear fashion). They have their own "Chambre syndicale du prêt-à-porter".

Imber is a village in Wiltshire, England, which has no people. It is on Salisbury Plain, a flat area in Southern England. The people of Imber were moved out in 1943, and rehoused elsewhere. The whole area was needed as a training ground for the military. Imber is now part of the British Army's largest training area in England.
The area around Imber has been settled since the Iron Age, before the Romans came to Britain. The first mention of the village was in Saxon times, in 967. The village is also listed in the Domesday Book. At that time, around fifty people lived there. The village has a church that was built in the 13th century. In the 14th century, about 250 people lived in the village. In 1851, the population reached its peak at about 440 people. When they left in 1943, about 150 people had to move.

<doc id="264055" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264055" title="Emoticon">
Emoticon

An emoticon () is a written symbol, often as 2 or 3 punctuation characters, that stands for the writer's mood or facial expression. Some examples are: a smile ":-)" or wink ";-)" or frown ":(" or dog nose ":O" or le meme arrow ">" (see many other examples in text below). Emoticons are often used to tell a reader about the general tone of a statement, and can change or improve the reading of plain writing. Over the years, many kinds of emoticons have been created, and now there are hundreds of known emoticons. The word "emoticon" is a blend of the English words "emotion" (or "emote") and "icon". In web forums, instant messengers and online games, text emoticons are often automatically replaced with small pictures, which came to be called "emoticons" as well. Certain complex character combinations can only be accomplished in a double-byte language, giving rise to very complex forms, sometimes known by their romanized Japanese name of "kaomoji".
The use of emoticons can be traced back to the 19th century, and they were commonly used in casual or humorous writing. In 1912, a smiling mouth (or snigger point) was shown in typewriter text as "\___/!". Digital forms of emoticons on the Internet were written in an email during 1982.
In April 1857, the "National Telegraphic Review and Operators Guide" wrote about the use of the number 73 in Morse code to mean "love and kisses" (later changed to "best regards"). A few years later, "Dodge's Manual" talked about a new way to show "love and kisses", the number 88.
A "New York Times" transcript of an 1862 speech given by Abraham Lincoln contains ";)" (now known as a winky-face). There is some debate as to whether it is a typo, a legitimate form of punctuation, or an emoticon.
Typographical emoticons were published in 1881 by the U.S. satirical magazine "Puck". In 1912, Ambrose Bierce created something called a "snigger point". "It is written thus \___/! and presents a smiling mouth."
Emoticons had already come into use in sci-fi fandom in the 1940s, although there seems to have been a lapse in cultural continuity between the communities.
In 1963 the "smiley face", a yellow button with two black dots representing eyes and an upturned thick curve representing a mouth, was created by freelance artist Harvey Ball. This smiley probably inspired many later emoticons; the most basic picture that shows this is in fact a small yellow smiley face.
In a "New York Times" interview in April 1969, Alden Whitman asked writer Vladimir Nabokov: "How do you rank yourself among writers (living) and of the immediate past?" Nabokov answered: "I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile – some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket, which I would now like to trace in reply to your question."
As early early as 1973 or earlier, teletype machine users used "emoticons" to express themselves. Teletypes were limited to the keys of a standard typewriter keyboard plus a few special characters. Teletype operators developed a sort of shorthand to communicate among themselves. These shorthand notations became the foundation of "emoticons" as video terminals began to replace teletypes in general use.
By the early 1970s, people on the PLATO System were using emoticons. They had many of the advantages of later character-based emoticons because they could be used anywhere that you could type text. They also had many of the advantages of later graphical emoticons because they used character overstriking which created graphical images.
Several Internet websites –such as BT's Connected Earth– assert that Kevin Mackenzie proposed -) as a joke-marker in April 1979, on the "MsgGroup" ARPANET mailing list. The idea was to indicate tongue-in-cheek, with the hyphen represented a tongue, not a nose:
Others used :-) for tongue-in-cheek, with the colon representing teeth. Also used was -:) to indicate sticking out your tongue, in derision or anger. Although similar to a sideways smiling face, the intended interpretation was different and this does not appear to have inspired the later smileys.
In the late sixties, the APL programming language and timesharing environment, with its rich character set with backspace and overstrike capability provided a fruitful arena for interactive and creative symbol invention. Union-backspace-dieresis (∪̈) was a recognised and upright smiley in the early seventies.
The first person documented to have used the emoticons :-) and :-(, with a specific suggestion that they be used to express emotion, was Scott Fahlman in the U.S. at Carnegie Mellon University; the text of his original proposal, posted to the Carnegie Mellon University computer science general board on 19 September 1982 (11:44), was thought to have been lost, but was recovered twenty years later by Jeff Baird from old backup tapes.
Within a few months, it had spread to the ARPANET (the early Internet) and 
Usenet. Many variations on the theme were immediately suggested by Scott and others.
In web forums, instant messengers and online games, text emoticons are often automatically replaced with small corresponding images, which also came to be called "Emoticons." Similarly, in some versions of Microsoft Word, the Auto Correct feature replaces basic smileys such as :-) and :-( with a single smiley-like character. Originally, these image emoticons were fairly simple and replaced only the most straightforward and common character sequences, but over time they became so complex that the more specialized emoticons are often input using a menu or popup windows, sometimes listing hundreds of items. Emoticons have also expanded beyond simple cartoon facial expressions to a variety of still or moving images. Some of these graphical emoticons do not actually represent faces or emotions; for example, an "emoticon" showing a guitar might be used to represent music. Further, some instant messaging software is designed to play a sound upon receiving certain emoticons.
Many applications use text codes, which become replaced with a graphical emoticon. For example, :dance: or (dance) could be replaced with a graphical dancing emoticon. A web-forum software package which performed this transformation was Proxicom Forum, developed in 1996.
An August 2004 issue of the "Risks Digest" ("comp.risks" on USENET) pointed out a problem with such features which are not under the sender's control:
Many sites use GIF or PNG graphic files, because of their transparency and small file size capabilities. Files can be created using a raster graphics editor. Many emoticon artists design their emoticons pixel by pixel. Some emoticons are made in vector format, such as SVG, and automatically processed using a graphics library. This allows SVG files to be automatically rendered as a GIF or PNG file, which is compatible with most browsers, which SVG is not.
Traditionally, the emoticon in Western style is written from left to right, the way one reads and writes in most Western cultures. Thus, most commonly, emoticons have the eyes on the left, followed by the nose and mouth. To more easily recognize them, tilt your head toward your left shoulder (or occasionally toward your right shoulder if the "top" of the emoticon is toward the right).
The most basic emoticons are relatively consistent in form, but each of them can also be transformed by being rotated (making them tiny ambigrams), with or a without hyphen (nose).
There are also some possible variations to emoticons to get new definitions, like changing a character to express a new feeling, or slightly change the mood of the emoticon. For example, :( equals sad and :(( equals very sad or weeping. A :"> blush can be expressed as :"u blushing for you or a surprised blush, o///o . Others include wink ;) a grin :D smug :-> and tongue out :P for disgust or simply just to stick the tongue out for silliness, such as when blowing a raspberry. An often used combination is also <3 for a heart, and </3 for a broken heart. A cute and sometimes gamine smile can be expressed like this: :3
An equal sign is often used for the eyes in place of the colon, without changing the meaning of the emoticon. In these instances, the hyphen is almost always either omitted or, occasionally, replaced with an 'o' as in =O) . In most circles it has become acceptable to omit the hyphen, whether a colon or an equal sign is used for the eyes, e.g. :) . In some areas of usage, people prefer the larger, more traditional emoticon :-) . In general, similar-looking characters are commonly substituted for one another: for instance, o, O, and 0 can all be used interchangeably, sometimes for subtly different effect. In some cases, one type of character may look better in a certain font and therefore be preferred over another.
Some variants are also more common in certain countries because of reasons like keyboard layouts, for example the smiley =) is common in Scandinavia where the keys for = and ) are placed right beside each other. Also, sometimes, the user can replace the brackets used for the mouth with other, similar shapes, such as ] and [ instead of ) and ( .
Diacritical marks are sometimes used. An O or U with an umlaut, Ö, Ü can be seen as an emoticon, as the upright version of :O (meaning that one is surprised) and :D (meaning that one is very happy). nwn (Meaning one is super happy).
Users from East Asia popularized a style of emoticons that can be understood without tilting one's head to the left. This style arose on ASCII NET of Japan in 1986. Similar looking emoticons were used by Byte Information Exchange (BIX) around the same time.
These emoticons are usually found in a format similar to (*_*). The asterisks indicate the eyes; the central character, commonly an underscore, the mouth; and the parentheses, the outline of the face. Two separate studies, in 2007 at Hokkaido University and in 2009 at Glasgow University, showed that Japanese and other East Asians read facial expressions by looking mainly at the eyes, and the researchers noted that this is reflected in East Asian emoticons which put emphasis on the eyes, compared to Western emoticons which emote mainly with the mouth.
Different emotions such as (")(-_-)("), are expressed by changing the character representing the eyes, for example ' T ' can be used to express crying or sadness (T_T). The emphasis on the eyes is reflected in the common usage of emoticons that use only the eyes, e.g. ^^. Looks of stress are represented by the likes of (x_x) while (-_-;) is a generic emote for nervousness, the semicolon indicating sweat that occurs during anxiety. Repeating the /// mark (///) can indicate embarrassment by symbolizing blushing. Characters like hyphens or periods can replace the underscore; the period is often used for a smaller, "cuter" mouth or to represent a nose, e.g. (^.^). Alternatively, the mouth/nose can be left out entirely, e.g. (^^). The parentheses also can often be replaced with braces, e.g. {^_^}. Many times, the parentheses are left out completely, e.g. ^^, >.<, o_O, O.O, <.<;, though this is more likely in Western culture. A quotation mark ", apostrophe ', or semicolon ; can be added to the emoticon to imply apprehension or embarrassment, in the same way that a sweat drop is used in anime.
Microsoft IME 2002 (Japanese) or later supports the use of both forms of emoticons by enabling Microsoft IME Spoken Language Dictionary. In IME 2007, it was moved to Emoticons dictionary.
Further variations of emoticons may be produced by using Combining characters, e.g. ̼⌂̺͛ᴖ̲̿ᴥ̲̿ᴖ̺͛⌂̼ and ٩(͡๏̯͡๏)۶ .
All of these can be used also with [ ] instead of ( ), or without the parentheses at all in some of the cases
In South Korea, emoticons using Korean Hangul letters have been getting popular lately as well. Korean styles of face emoticons are similar to those of Japan's, but they contain Korean jamos (letters) instead of other characters. There are countless number of emoticons that can be formed with such combinations of Korean jamos, but popular choices include letter ㅅ or ㅂ as the mouth/nose component and ㅇ,ㅎ,ㅍ for the eyes. For example: ㅇㅅㅇ, ㅇㅂㅇ, -ㅅ-, ㅡㅡ, ㅡ6ㅡ. Faces such as 'ㅅ', "ㅅ", 'ㅂ','ㅇ', using quotation marks " and apostrophes ' are also commonly used combinations. Vowel jamos such as ㅜ,ㅠ can be used in substitute to T, when depicting a crying face. Example: //ㅅ//, ㅜ_ㅜ, ㅠ_ㅠ. Sometimes the underscore is omitted, and the two letters can be mixed together, as in ㅜ_ㅠ, ㅡ^ㅜ, ㅜㅇㅡ . Also, semicolons are used a lot in Korean emoticons. Example: ㅡㅡ;;;;, ㅇㅅㅇ;;;, ㅂㅇㅂ;, ㅎㅇㅎ;;;;.
-_-
Single or multiple ; (Semicolons) are often used together with faces depicting embarrassment, for an added effect. Also, other characters may be added to indicate hands, similar to the Japanese emoticons; but usually they are only attached on the right. Example: -ㅅ-a (scratching one's head), 'ㅅ'b (Thumbs up), 'ㅅ'ㅗ (The finger)
In some cases, like ㅎ_ㅎ, the emoticon can mean an emotion even when it is not depicting a face of any specific emotion. Letters ㅎ and ㅋ are widely used in Korean internet as a sign of laughter (similar to the usage of "w" in Japanese Web)for example ㅋㅇㅋ, ㅎㅇㅎ, ㅋㅅㅋ, ㅋ-ㅋ, ㅎ_ㅎ; and so the emoticons using those letters as the eye component can be interpreted as a laughing face.
Also, ㅇㅈㄴ is a Korean version of Orz - although OTL is used more often- depicting a man kneeling down.
English-language anime forums adopted those emoticons that could be used with the standard ASCII characters available on western keyboards. Because of this, they are often called "anime style" emoticons in the English-speaking Internet. They have since seen use in more mainstream venues, including online gaming, instant-messaging, and other non-anime related forums. Emoticons such as <(^.^)>,<(^_^<),<(o_o<),<( -'.'- )>,<('.'-^),(.ㅅ.), which include the parentheses, mouth or nose, and arms (especially those represented by the inequality signs < or >) also are often referred to as "Kirbies" in reference to their likeness to Nintendo's video game character, Kirby. The parentheses are usually dropped when used in the English language context, and the underscore of the mouth may be extended as an intensifier, e.g. ^__________^ for very happy. People also use >< or : ). Usually on MSN, people use O.O or : ( "Screw you" is represented by a smiley showing middle finger(s) .!._(Ò_ó)_.!..
Exposure to both Western and East Asian style emoticons or emoji through web blogs, instant messaging, and forums featuring a blend of Western and Asian pop culture, has given rise to emoticons that have an upright viewing format. The parentheses are similarly dropped in the English language context and the emoticons only use alphanumeric characters and the most commonly used English punctuation marks. Emoticons such as -O-, -3-, -w-, '_', ;_;, T_T, :>, and .V., are used to convey mixed emotions that are more difficult to convey with traditional emoticons. Characters are sometimes added to emoticons to convey an anime or manga-styled sweat drop, for example: ^_^' or !>_<! or ^3^' or v3v; as well as: <@>_________<@>;; ;O; and *u*
The equal sign can also be used for closed, anime looking eyes, for example: =0=, =3=, =w=, =A=
There are also more faces along those lines like >o<; using the ; as a sweat mark, and the "o" as a mouth, and the inequality signs as the eyes, it shows stress, or slight confusion. The amount of emoticons that can be made are limitless, and all have their own meaning.
In Brazil, sometimes combining character (accent) are added to emoticons to represent eyebrows, like: ò_ó or ó_ò or õ_o or ù_u or o_Ô. They can also replace (or add) "=" or ":" by ">", example: >D or >=D or >P or >:P or >3 or >:3.
The Japanese language is usually encoded using double-byte character codes. As a result, there is a bigger variety of characters that can be used in emoticons, many of which cannot be reproduced in ASCII. Most kaomoji contain Cyrillic and other foreign letters to create even more complicated expressions analogous to ASCII art's level of complexity. To type such emoticons, the input editor that is used to type Japanese on a user's system has a dictionary of emoticons, after which the user simply types the Japanese word (or something close to it) that represents the desired emoticon to convert the input into such complicated emoticons. Such expressions are known as Shift JIS art.
Users of 2channel in particular have developed a wide variety of unique emoticons using obscure characters. Some have taken on a life of their own and become characters in their own right, like Mona.
Orz (also seen as Or2, on_, OTZ, OTL, STO, JTO, _no, ＿冂○, 囧rz, O7Z, _|7O, Sto, and Jto) is a Japanese emoticon representing a kneeling or bowing person, with the "o" being the head, the "r" being the arms and part of the body, and the "z" being part of the body and the legs. This stick figure represents failure and despair. It is also commonly used for representing a great admiration (sometimes with an overtone of sarcasm) for someone else's view or action.
It was first used in late 2002 at the forum on Techside, Japanese personal website. At the "Techside FAQ Forum" (TECHSIDE教えて君BBS(教えてBBS) ), a poster asked about a cable cover, typing "＿|￣|○" to show a cable and its cover. Others commented that it looked like a kneeling person, and the symbol became popular. These comments were soon deleted as they were considered off-topic. However, one of the first corresponding reactions can be found on the thread on , on December 23, 2002. By 2005, Orz spawned a subculture: blogs have been devoted to the emoticon, and URL shortening services have been named after it. In Taiwan, Orz is associated with the phrase "nice guy"–that is, the concept of males being rejected for a date by girls they are pursuing with a phrase like "You are a nice guy."
Orz should not be confused with m(_ _)m, which means an apology.
A portmanteau of "emotion" and "sound", an emotisound is a brief sound transmitted and played back during the viewing of a message, typically an IM message or e-mail message. The sound is intended to communicate an emotional subtext. Many instant messaging clients automatically trigger sound effects in response to specific emoticons.
Some services, such as MuzIcons, combine emoticons and Adobe Flash music player in a widget.
In 2004, The Trillian chat application introduced an feature called "emotiblips", which allows Trillian users to stream files to their instant message recipients "as the voice and video equivalent of an emoticon".
In 2007, MTV and Paramount Home Entertainment promoted the "emoticlip" as a form of viral marketing for the second season of the show "The Hills". The emoticlips were twelve short snippets of dialogue from the show, uploaded to YouTube, which the advertisers hoped would be distributed between web users as a way of expressing feelings in a similar manner to emoticons. The emoticlip concept is credited to the Bradley & Montgomery advertising firm, which hopes they would be widely adopted as "greeting cards that just happen to be selling something".
In 2008 an emotion-sequence animation tool, called FunIcons was created. The Adobe Flash and Java-based application allows users to create a short animation. Users can then email or save their own animations to use them on similar social utility applications.
In 2000 Despair, Inc. obtained a U.S. trademark registration for the "frowny" emoticon :-( when used on "greeting cards, posters and art prints." In 2001, they issued a satirical press release, announcing that they would sue Internet users who typed the frowny; the joke backfired and the company received a storm of protest when its mock release was posted at technology news website Slashdot. They subsequently issued another press release a month later in response to the reaction their claim had generated.
A number of patent applications have been filed on inventions that assist in communicating with emoticons. A few of these have issued as US patents. U.S. patent 6987991, for example, discloses a method developed in 2001 to send emoticons over a cell phone using a drop down menu. The stated advantage over the prior art was that the user saved on the number of keystrokes though this may not address the obviousness criteria.
In Finland, the emoticons :-), =), =(, :) and :( were trademarked in 2006 for use with various products and services. The emoticon :-) was also filed in 2006 and registered in 2008 as a European Community Trademark (CTM).
In 2008, Russian entrepreneur Oleg Teterin claimed to have been granted the trademark on the ;-) emoticon. A license would not "cost that much - tens of thousands of dollars" for companies, but would be free of charge for individuals.
In 2010 in the United Kingdom, the British chocolate company Meltwater Chocolate filed a trademark application for a series of two marks :D and :-D in class 30, covering chocolate and confectionery.

Trough (geology)

In geology, a trough refers to a linear depression that extends in one direction over a distance. It is less steep than a trench. A trough can be a narrow basin or a geologic rift. There are various oceanic troughs, troughs found under oceans; examples include the rifts along the mid-ocean ridges.

Innuendo

An innuendo is an indirect or implied statement of ideas or opinions. It can also be a remark or question, often disparaging (also called insinuation), that works indirectly by allusion. In the latter sense, the intention is often to insult or accuse someone in such a way that the words as used, taken literally, seem to be innocent in the direct meaning (but have a negative unspoken meaning).
An innuendo is "an oblique hint or remark"; The word is often used to express disapproval.
The term sexual innuendo has a specific meaning, namely that of a "risqué" "double sens" (double meaning) by playing on a possibly sexual meaning of an otherwise innocent statement.
Innuendo is a tool of bullying.
Many TV shows\movies aimed at little kids often use innuendoes as a way of attracting older people. Shows\movies such as "The Fairly OddParents", "Spongebob Squarepants","The Penguins of Madagascar", "Shrek", "Bee Movie", " the "Walt Disney Animated Classics", "Rocko's Modern Life", "The Muppet Show", "Cow & Chicken", "Ren & Stimpy", "Animaniacs" and "Looney Tunes" have been known to do this over the years. Also many prime-time shows use an extensive amount of innuendo to the point that they are rated U.S. TV PG/14 D for dialogue. Some TV shows using innuendoes are: "The Simpsons", "Futurama", "Son of the Beach", "The Office", "Jersey Shore (TV series)", "King of the Hill", "Beavis and Butthead", "Everybody Hates Chris", "American Dad", "Tosh.0", "Family Guy" and "South Park".
Also, many radio shows are known for use of innuendo, including: "The Gallo Radio Show", most of the songs played on "Southern Crossroads", sometimes "The Rick & Bubba Show", "The Howard Stern Show", "The Steve and DC Morning Show", especially "The JT & Dave Show", "Air Bubba" and "The Bob & Tom Show".

Wikipedia:Avoiding difficult users

There are relatively few difficult users, but they need to be avoided to stay focused on writing the encyclopedia, and not let petty squabbles cause frustrations and doubts about other, decent users. Vast numbers of users, rarely seen, are highly considerate and intelligent people. Only a few users are difficult, so they should be avoided to keep working with the nice guys. Avoiding those users also means avoiding several significant articles where they obsess and dwell. It might seem that difficult users could be confronted and stopped, but when they group together, they are almost unstoppable. They scare other users or who do not have time to fight against all of their many antics and complex games targeting their victims.
Simple Wikipedia has roughly thousand registered users, so if the vast bulk of people were jerks, then every article would be totally trashed, and every user-page would be filled with warring insults added by everyone else. No, instead, most wiki-people are basically good, and it is just a "small group" of difficult users who cause most problems. Yet, those problems are hideous nightmares of lies, distortion, innuendo, with later hounding of users into being edit-blocked, or removed from Wikipedia.
Plus, even a small percentage, of users, is a considerable number of difficult users. Consequently, they are encountered, every few days, and even though rare, they know how to be difficult. They have a history of being difficult, so they've had a lot of practice, and know all the tricks to upsetting people. You think you know how difficult people can be, but you have no idea.
A lot of difficult users act like Internet trolls on meth: they bait and insult to get a reaction, and to see their victims suffer and react with justifiable rage, to gain an advantage over them. Then the victims are blamed for getting mad and acting hostile, blamed by "cherry-picking" their angry responses without showing how they were tricked or goaded into becoming furious. To save time, many admins look mostly at the (carefully) selected angry responses. Those admins warn the victims to admit their mistakes or face severe blocking or topic bans. The reason the victims are quickly blamed is because they clearly wrote angry remarks, and in the long run, the various users must co-exist, and if the victims are fewer then they are easier to change than the larger majority of their tormentors. This logic gives power to groups of bullies who are seen as "the community" of most users. They learn to complain, within the rules of making disputes, playing along with cohorts to game-the-system, often but not always, to win their fights against opponents.
Wikipedia is a relatively neophyte (new baby) system, and it has no penalties for false accusations, unlike the mirrored, reverse punishments for false accusations handled many centuries ago in the Code of Hammurabi. So, even when wiki-tormentors are found to be making false accusations, the result is merely that the complaint is refuted, so "no harm done" and there is no punishment (at all in any form whatsoever) for people who invent witch-hunts, thus they are free to try again, hoping for a likely win, in the next false accusations they make. If false accusations were, some day, to be punished, as an eye-for-an-eye, then false claims would be greatly reduced and made less likely, as being too risky to try.
Also, if most trouble makers are ignored rather than scolded, then they lose interest when their victims escape the trap of posting angry replies, so they move on to find other victims. To avoid them, perhaps just switch the subject to edit even 5 other, minor articles, and the trolls will lose interest, because the controversial issue they debated has been washed away by the numerous details in 5 dull articles.
The illusion of "jerk-ipedia" is fostered when difficult users band together, as a sort of gang mentality. Even though they are few, when perhaps 5 people gang up and spew vitriol onto a new user, it gives the intense illusion, as one person concluded: "The inmates are running the asylum". They are not. Most people in charge are not nut-cases, not slowly insulting others. The vast majority of Wikipedia articles are written by normal people, with healthy attitudes, and common courtesy. Most of the on Simple Wikipedia are well-mannered and grounded in reality, and any unusual admins who join are generally removed, and soon.
Wikipedia warns each new user not to reveal personal information. Do not create a username the same as on Facebook, YouTube or Google. Although they don't necessarily know where anyone lives, some difficult users find where you "write". The problem of wiki-stalking involves tracing user-editing of various pages, along with determining a list of people you have contacted, by analyzing your access to user-talk pages, or other websites. The real dangers:
Basically, you don't even need to be present, at all, to have a long set of problems thrust into each article you wrote, contacts to users you know, and debates stating how wrong your opinions are (or rather, "would be" as the guess you would state). Even though you never even entered the discussion, some users will predict your opinions (in writing) just to let others see how wrong you are about something you never said.
Many types, of difficult users, can be detected early, by off-balance actions that they employ: "where there's smoke there's fire". Now, remember, that several users might just be copy-catting bad behavior, so the first impressions, of how people behave, are somewhat misleading. Look for 2 or more warning signs, and compare as repeated patterns of behavior. Some signs:
Again, many difficult users have a lot of impact, so some new users might get goaded into bad behavior, in a copy-cat manner, and it takes a few combined actions to realize the behavior is a pattern of intentional, negative, and insulting actions by truly difficult users.
Perhaps keep a list of users who insult you, noting the date and type of insult. If those same people insult you again, check the difference in dates and the type of comment they made. Consider: "Where there's smoke, there's fire" so plan to avoid those people or expect the likely results in the risk of working with them.
Of course, many Wikipedia editors have left in disgust at such petty, childish, psycho behavior. However, remember, in general, when it comes to your "bad" wiki-reputation, no one really cares. It's a volunteer project, and most people are too busy to worry about wiki-reputations. If people really cared about that, then certainly all difficult users would have been banned for their reputations, many years ago, banned from the wiki-Solar System long ago. But they haven't; instead, troublesome users are generally ignored, and so are their angry remarks about your wiki-reputation.
Most people have simply decided to ignore those difficult users and, also, ignore the veiled insults or other mud thrown at wiki-reputations. In general, people don't think about who is wrong or who is right, but rather, "Those guys sure argued a whole lot". Decent people won't believe too many angry remarks that others say about you. So it is not a real problem, like it might be in live social settings, where typically, insults must be backed by some real facts to convince others.
Similar to a legendary troll under the bridge, who waits and makes demands of travellers trying to cross the bridge, the difficult users tend to hang around some significant articles, knowing that certain people will want to change or correct part of the text. Just as the troll exerts power against those wanting to cross the bridge, the difficult users feel they have a "captive audience" in particular articles. Specific changes will be reverted and disallowed by them. Those articles should be avoided, abandoned, as areas of continual confrontation, at least for a few weeks or months.
Perhaps the most that can be done is to lodge a "POV dispute" on an article's talk-page, but not carry out a protracted debate, because the difficult users will likely escalate any rebellion to become wiki-stalking and hounding of their rivals. However, soon, some of those users will likely "archive" your comment topics (as being old topics) from the active talk-page, further denying your voice about the article. At any given time, there are well over 50,000 highly significant article topics, so just visit some minor articles first, until those difficult users have lost interest in following. Then, later, try to improve some other significant article, which is not a battleground for such controversies.
Wikipedia is a neophyte (new baby) forum for users, so it does not have limits for obsessive editors, such as a limit to how many times a day, or month, someone can edit an article, or post a message. If each user's article edits were limited, within a month, then the power to continually re-change an article would be reduced for those types of people.
Many difficult users have left within 2 years of joining Wikipedia, as they struggled to gain more power, but were continually ignored or rejected. Eventually, they snapped, and went out in a "blaze of glory" by insulting everything and everyone, until the admins reverted their hateful, final rants from the pages where they had cast their vicious parting remarks.
However, other less maniacal users have acted as "semi-trolls" with more balance, and remained years longer. One user thought the solution was to list every difficult user on his user-talk page, but that tends to merely anger them. Instead, just keep a private list, off-line from Wikipedia, so that when the names of difficult users re-appear, you can review their infamous antics of the past, and take evasive action.
Each veiled insult, or slur, against your wiki-reputation can be given an easy spin, with follow-on wording that focuses on a strongly positive view about each comment. Examples:
Although the glowing, positive terms might seem excessive, the effect is perfect. A dull veiled insult, obviously intended to scar your reputation (in writing), is reformed into a 100x times greater compliment, to all who later see the entry. Because of the hugely wonderful, over-the-top positive wording, those spins have a second benefit of laughing away the insults, which were not just undone, but thoroughly trounced, beaten down 100 times, by the overly-positive wording of the enthusiastic spin. The reason each spin can work so well, against the insults, is that, typically, an insulting remark must be mild (otherwise it becomes a vicious personal attack), so consequently the positive spin can easily claim a viewpoint 100x times the opposite, as an enormous compliment. The result: insults can always be reworded as a 100x better compliment. It's a guaranteed easy win, with a humorous spin 100x times funnier than the meager insults. Rather than having to re-read, each time, the negative wording of the insult, the text to be seen, each time, is the glowing positive view of the improvements (or other "great impact to the universe") that you have made.
You will have won, completely, and avoided the insulting words of the difficult users.
It might be tempting to try to reform the difficult users. A moderate amount of personal discussion, with those users, could be considered as beneficial to Wikipedia. However, Wikipedia is funded to write the encyclopedia, not provide cyber-counseling or psychiatric treatment to disturbed individuals, and not to convert the hearts of hateful people to become humanized or Christianized. It would be unethical to use Wikipedia outside the stated policies of the Wikimedia Foundation, even when following good intentions. Perhaps the most you can do is to say a prayer, or otherwise, counsel with them outside the scope of Wikipedia, but always protect your identity: "Beyond this point, there be demons".
Many difficult users tend to block progress, and some simply want to stop others from writing, or expanding articles, with information they don't want to be shown. Confrontations with them can be utterly demoralizing and make people want to quit Wikipedia, then warn hundreds of people about the horrifying, degrading, disgusting experiences they had while being insulted, tormented, and hounded on Wikipedia.
Again, the interactions with difficult users can be so unpleasant that many people have quit. Consequently, because of that focus, the simple act of ignoring troublesome users, and moving on to improve another article, constitutes a total victory over their attempts to block other people from working on other articles, although the trolled articles are virtually hopeless.
Try to tune out the difficult users and, instead, always remember the millions of other people who are helping to improve Wikipedia. Mustering the renewed enthusiasm, to improve even one more article, is the ultimate win.

Wikipedia:Alert

This essay, WP:Alert, lists many ways to get alerts, news, and answers about Wikipedia issues. Almost any question imaginable has already been answered by someone, at sometime, in Wikipedia's thousands of project-space pages (named as in "Wikipedia:xxxx").
Search below (using the browser menu "Find" option) for various details: about Wikipedia system news, about help pages, about surveys or polls, about wiki-technology & servers, about wiki-software updates, about Wikipedia size and users, about Contacting admins, or about MediaWiki markup language.
Many wiki-related news events are described, briefly, in part of the monthly "" document for Simple Wikipedia, under subpages for "news", as . Also, some events are posted in .
Note that the publication dates vary, and the news is not updated every week, but rather every several days, with no definite schedule. Those pages are NOT part of Wikinews, which is instead about general world events.
The wiki-technology is described, briefly, in part of the monthly English Wikipedia " document, under subpages for various publication dates, such as:
Topics include the computers used as wiki-servers plus the MediaWiki software that stores pages, processes , formats and displays the .
The MediaWiki updates are described, in brief tech jargon, in part of the monthly English Wikipedia " document, under subpages for various publication dates, such as:
Each "Technology_report" lists bug fixes or changes, such as:
In January 2008 (over years ago), the MediaWiki software was upgraded with a major change to the NewPP parser (which reads Wikipedia files) for faster formatting: the new software allows almost unlimited page-size, and huge templates, by using a recursive descent parser. In the past, large templates could only be used a few hundred times per page, such as when a template had the help-text documentation or several HTML comments. However, now any documentation text can be skipped by using "<noinclude>" at the sections to bypass.
The Wikipedia articles, talk-pages and project pages are displayed as typical browser screen windows. However, they can be customized, for each user, such as setting the page-skin layout, by selecting "my preferences" at the top of any page. For example, consider the following options:
There are many more options, depending on each user, which might be more beneficial for displaying some types of pages or images.
The main manual is the " (), with another document describing typical article-format, under ".
A few surveys have been conducted over the past 6 years, for the English Wikipedia and the German Wikipedia, to determine reader opinions about WP content and performance. About wiki surveys:
The Simple Wikipedia help pages (at ), which cover many wiki aspects, also link to the MediaWiki help pages (under ) about the underlying software and database servers that store the Wikipedia data. Also consider:
There are many thousands of other WP project pages to consider, as well.
Although the Wikipedia project has existed since 2001, many aspects have remained at a neophyte, or novice, level. The problems of uneven quality are critical to understand: there have been large gaps in Wikipedia's collaboration procedures, and in various fields of study, some major topics went years without being covered in an article. Some of the subjects which have lagged the most are: , financial topics, and African studies. While there are over 800,000 articles about sports, there might be only limited articles on other subjects.
Also, although some Wikipedia policies are very thorough, as written, many active users make decisions while still unaware of the actual policy details, and some imagine that Wikipedia "invents all rules" regardless of the real world. On the contrary, Wikipedia does, indeed, follow many mainstream ideas, and articles must be against the real-world sources. However, the neophyte aspects and uneven quality help to answer why Wikipedia has many hollow areas, either overlooked or purposely hindered by some users dodging policy controls (see or ). Some aspects of Wikipedia might seem shocking due to those long-term neophyte issues. For example, per , a "consensus" is basically a unanimous decision (of users acting in good faith), but many people treat it as a majority rule (as "consens-Us-versus-Them").
There are many official Wikipedia , so don't be surprised if long-term users are not familiar with all of them. Some people try to treat guidelines as being far inferior, to policies, but most guidelines have been developed by careful editors who are trying to provide solid advice, to simplify the writing of articles, while working with other users. The navbox below links to the various policies and guidelines.
New guidelines are sometimes created by expanding Wikipedia essays into broader, and more formalized wording.

There are many methods to avoid edit-conflicts. Users can request control of editing by saving a tag-template, when finishing an edit, to alert future readers:
However, realize the tag is only a request. Instead, if only 1 SAVE is made (by pre-combining all changes), then other editors will only be alerted to check that page when your "entire edit" is done. In the event of overlooked typos, it might be safer to visit another page for editing, and return after an hour when other users are done editing the page (they might also fix those typos). However, once a page is saved, other editors might update it every 3 minutes, because many will change a word and save, change a word & save, even though they know it's sloppy: the fear of losing multiple changes makes some people SAVE after every tiny change. Those people should learn to request control by , even if only for 1 hour.  See essay: .
When a user tries to save an edit that a prior editor has meanwhile updated, the entire page is rejected, during "edit conflict". To avoid losing data, before a SAVE, the edit-buffer should be copied (Ctrl-A/Ctrl-C) into another window, or edit-previewed to save the back-window, and then parts of that text could be restored during a later re-edit. Also, editing just 1 section, at an "[edit]" tab, can reduce some types of edit-conflict.   See essay: .
Generally, the should NOT be contacted directly, unless they request your input. Wikipedia has the help desk to answer most questions, beginning at or . Also, there are several queueing systems to post user-requests to get various services, and some admins take turns in responding to the requests in each queue. New page deletions, requested by edit-tagging each page, are handled in several page-category queues linked by inserting, at the top of a new-article page, the template line ". A user's private copy of an article can be delete-flagged, by that user, inserting the line " at the top of a page. Older pages need to have discussion with other interested users at: "". The queue lines for reporting abuse are explained in the following page of Wikipedia policy topics, focused around the active list in the .
If multiple editors argue too much about some articles, the official ruling might not be a clear-cut decision of right/wrong, but instead, all of those editors might be banned from changing those articles for 6 months (or longer). Starting a fight usually hurts the good people the most, because their time is wasted as much as those who actively invent trouble. tends to be a good method to reduce abuse.
Wikipedia pages are written in the MediaWiki markup language, which supports some HTML coding, and which also allows special coding for , , , and templates (see: ).
Any page can contain live calculations using the "#expr" as follows:<br>
The expression will be evaluated and displayed on the page. As of 
March 2010, local variables are still NOT allowed: codice_1 is invalid (Error: Unrecognised word "x"), although local variables would be trivial to implement for a college student.

In the past, Wikipedia has avoided the use of detailed maps or road maps, in favor of limited, blank maps which had mostly shaded areas to indicate general borders (edges of regions), counties or provinces. Meanwhile, the Wikimedia Commons area contains many maps for all nations or territories, in the form of the "Wikiatlas" pages, covered with numerous maps, such as in:
Each Atlas page can vary slightly, but each contains multiple maps, such as a general map, blank-outline map, terrain map (elevation map), a precipitation map, a cities map, population map, earth-quake fault lines, and others. Also see: Wikiatlas, for a common map of Europe, map of USA, map of Italy, map of England, map of Germany, etc.

Wikiatlas

The Wikiatlas or Wikimedia Atlas of the World (or Commons Atlas)
is a on the Wikimedia Commons website, related to the English Wikipedia . It contains thousands of gallery pages and maps about many nations or regions of the world.
As a collection of map image-galleries, the Wikiatlas links many sets of maps, such as:
Unlike Wikibooks or Wikisource, the Wikiatlas is not a separate wiki website, but rather, a large subset of the Wikimedia website.
There are many thousands of maps in the WikiAtlas.
The Wikiatlas is based on some simple ideas. All maps are grouped, in the manner of a World atlas, into pages stored with the name "Atlas of..." for each continent, such as:
Similar page titles "Atlas of..." cover each nation or region, such as:
Some of the U.S. states also have Wikiatlas pages, such as:
Similarly, hundreds of other Wikiatlas pages are named as "Atlas of..." for over 200 nations and over 94 other regions of the World.
Many pages in the Wikiatlas are arranged in a distinctive format: with maps displayed down the left-side of the page, and explanatory text presented to the right-hand side. The description for each nation, territory, or region is written, first, in the official language(s) of the area, followed by other languages, including English.
Because the Wikiatlas is a wiki effort, developed by the Wikimedia volunteers, the level of detail and coverage varies, from section to section, of the Wikiatlas. Some groups of maps are very extensive, while other maps are rudimentary, depending on the time spent by volunteer writers.
The Wikiatlas was designed, during extended discussions on the Wikimedia website, beginning in 2003.
Originally, the concept was to have an "automatic" map-generator, based on giving coordinates. However, use of maps beyond mere location, led to the current vast collections of maps also showing economic areas, precipitation, average-temperature, political regions, earthquake fault-lines, etc. To show a location was only one way to use maps.
Many thousands of maps were collected, over the years. However, by June 2005, the Wikiatlas subproject still lacked sufficient structure to be considered viable.
In April 2006, the Wikiatlas was mentioned in an archaeology
conference as a "nascent" project.
Finally, a coherent page-format was generalized during mid-2007, using page layouts stored in MediaWiki template files. Hundreds of Wikimedia and Wikipedia editors worked on various aspects of the page descriptions in over 100 languages, including uploading and modifying the thousands of map images. Some of the maps were transferred from Wikipedia image pages.
Although readership figures are not specifically available, of the complete grouping of all Wikiatlas pages, the general readership of the Wikimedia website has been based, nearly 50% (in early 2009), within the following: United States 24.5%, Germany 10.7%, India 5.7%, United Kingdom 4.0%, and Italy 3.5%.

Copper(II) nitrate

Copper(II) nitrate, also known as cupric nitrate, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Cu(NO). It contains copper in its +2 oxidation state. It also contains nitrate ions.
Copper(II) nitrate is a blue solid. It is an oxidizing agent. It is blue whether it contains water (hydrated) or not (anhydrous). It makes nitrogen dioxide when it is heated.
It is made by reacting copper with nitrogen tetroxide. It can also be made by reacting copper with nitric acid or silver nitrate. 
It can be used to make nitric acid by heating it. Then the brown gas made is dissolved in water to make nitric acid. It can be used to add nitrate ions to organic chemicals. 
Copper ions are toxic, like many other metals. Nitrates are oxidizing agents and can make things burn.

Orogeny

Orogeny is the process of mountain-building. It takes place when two tectonic plates come together. Orogens develop while a continental plate is crumpled and thickened to form mountain ranges, and involve a great range of geological processes collectively called orogenesis. Examples:
Another, less common cause is when a plate moves over a hot spot in the Earth's mantle. Examples:
There is a third process, called "delamination". Here an unstable portion of cold root of the lithosphere drips down into the mantle, decreasing the density of the lithosphere and causing buoyant uplift. Example:
Areas that are rifting apart, such as mid-ocean ridges and the East African Rift have mountains due to thermal buoyancy caused by the hot mantle underneath them, which pushes them up. This thermal buoyancy is known as "dynamic topography". Examples:

List of Formula One Grand Prix winners (constructors)

Formula One, abbreviated to F1, is a form of open-wheeled auto racing. It is the highest class defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body. The "formula" in the name refers to a set of rules. These rules tell the builders and drivers of the cars what they may and may not do. The F1 world championship season is a series of races. These races are known as Grands Prix. They are usually held on purpose-built circuits. In a few places, they are held on closed city streets. The most famous Grand Prix is the Monaco Grand Prix in Monte Carlo. The top finisher of each race are awarded championship points. The points are added up at the end of they year. There are two yearly Championships. The one for drivers and one for constructors.
Ferrari hold the record for the most Grands Prix victories. They have won 216 times. McLaren are second with 173 wins, and Williams are third with 113 wins. British teams have won the most Grands Prix. Twelve British teams have won a total of 499 races between them. Italian teams are second with 237 wins between five teams. French teams are third with 53 Grands Prix wins between three teams.

The Red billed Quelea is a small passerine bird of the Ploceidae family. It is found only in Africa. 
There are more Quelea than any other bird species in the world: they number over 1.5 billion. Single colonies may have as many as 30 million. Queleas can migrate as far as 2,000 kilometres (1,243 miles). Single flocks can destroy as much as 50 tons of grain a day. Queleas have destroyed over US$22 million of grain in a single year.
Males grow to a length of about 4.75 inches (12 cm) with a 1.75 inch (4.45 cm) tail and weigh 19.47 grams (0.69 oz). Females are a little smaller growing to about 4.60 inches (11.68 cm) with a 1.70 inch (4.32 cm) tail and weigh 18.34 grams (0.65 oz).
Nests are built by the males and take about seven days to complete. Males defend the nest while building it and become very angry when something gets too close. After it is complete, females lay 3 to 7 eggs. Eggs hatch in about two weeks. Males continue to defend the nest after the eggs hatch.

Bayes' theorem

In probability theory and applications, Bayes' theorem shows the relation between a conditional probability and its reverse form. For example, the probability of a hypothesis given some observed pieces of evidence and the probability of that evidence given the hypothesis. This theorem is named after Thomas Bayes ( or "bays") and often called Bayes' law or Bayes' rule.
The equation used is:
Where:
A simple example is as follows: There is a 40% chance of it raining on Sunday. If it rains on Sunday, there is a 10% chance it will rain on Monday. If it didn't rain on Sunday, there's an 80% chance it will rain on Monday.
"Raining on Sunday" is event A, and "Raining on Monday" is event B.
The first thing we'd normally calculate is the probability of it raining on Monday:
This would be the sum of the probability of "Raining on Sunday and raining on Monday" and "Not raining on Sunday and raining on Monday"
However, what if we said: "It rained on Monday. What is the probability it rained on Sunday?" That is where Bayes' theorem comes in. It allows us to calculate the probability of an earlier event, given the result of a later event.
The equation used is:
In our case, "Raining on Sunday" is event A, and "Raining on Monday" is event B.
So, to calculate the probability it rained on Sunday, given that it rained on Monday:
or:
In other words, if it rained on Monday, there's a 7.69% chance it rained on Sunday.
To calculate the probability of it having rained on Sunday, given that it rained on Monday, we can take the following steps:
Therefore,
Another way to see this, which shows where Bayes' theorem comes from, is to consider the probability P(AB) that it rains on both Sunday and Monday. This can be calculated in two different ways, which give the same answer for P(AB):
Bayes' theorem is just another way to write that equation.

Hot pants, or 'short shorts', are a fashion item from the 1960s which is still popular today. They first appeared as a design item in so-called 'Swinging London'. The trend for shorter, brighter shorts for young women was started by designers in London such as Mary Quant.
Running or gym shorts are worn by girls as normal wear in some places. Many gym shorts have an inlay made of a comfortable fabric such as cotton, similar to swim shorts (swimming trunks). These are designed to be worn without underwear.
If a person cuts off the legs of a pair of jeans, that's known as a 'cut-off'.
The character Daisy Duke from "The Dukes of Hazzard" was known for wearing low cut blue jeans. The popularity of the character led to the term "Daisy Dukes" being used for short shorts.

The mini-skirt, or miniskirt, is a skirt well above the knees, close to the buttocks. If the top and skirt are all-in-one, then it is a minidress. Microskirts are "extremely" brief, and usually worn only for publicity events.
Mini-skirts were invented by Mary Quant, who also invented, or promoted, hot pants. There is disagreement as to who came up with the idea first; some say André Courrèges or John Bates. The short- and ever-shorter skirt was evolving already among fashion-minded young women: the designers who adapted it just helped spread the style. In Quant's case, she gave it the name. Mary Quant named the mini-skirt after her favorite make of car, the Mini. She loved the car so much, she had one designed especially for her.

From 1970 until 1987, the event was held at the Österreichring, near Zeltweg. In 1975, it was called the European Grand Prix. In 1987, the FIA decided that the circuit was too dangerous. The race was dropped for a decade.
In 1995 and 1996, the track was modified and brought up to modern standards. The race returned to F1 in 1997. The circuit was renamed the A1-Ring, after a sponsor. Most of the new track is in Spielberg. Spielberg was now used as the location of the Grand Prix. The final Austrian Grand Prix was held in 2003.

Moroccan Grand Prix

The Moroccan Grand Prix was a Grand Prix motor racing event. It began in 1925 in Casablanca, Morocco. The official name was "Casablanca Grand Prix".
In 1930, the race was moved to the new Anfa Racecourse. There was no race in 1933. There were no races between 1935 and 1953. When it returned in 1954, it was held on a circuit at the city of Agadir for sports cars.
A new circuit at Ain-Diab near Casablanca was ready for the 1957 Moroccan Grand Prix Formula One race. This race did not counttoward the World Championship. The only World Championship F1 race was in 1958. The race was marred by the death of Stuart Lewis-Evans. This was the last Grand Prix organized in Morocco.

Typesetting

Typesetting is the making of block-printed writing which is formed by using types grouped from sorts.
Typesetting uses the earlier steps of designing a font and storing it in some manner. Typesetting is the taking of the stored letters (called "sorts" in mechanical systems and "glyphs" in digital systems) and the ordering of them in the manner of a language's orthography for showing them on a page.
During the letterpress era, moveable type was composed by hand for each page. Cast metal "sorts" were grouped into words and lines of text and tightly bound together to make up a page image called a "forme". All letter faces were set to the same height, to form an even surface of type. The forme was mounted in a machine press, inked, and an impression made on paper.
The diagram at right shows a cast metal sort: a face, b body or shank, c point size, 1 shoulder, 2 nick, 3 groove, 4 foot. Wooden printing sorts were in use for centuries in combination with metal type. 
Copies of formes were cast when expecting later printings of a text, freeing the costly type for other work. In this process, called stereotyping, the entire forme is pressed into a fine matrix such as plaster of Paris or papier mâché called Flong to create a positive, from which the stereotype forme was cast of type metal. 
Hand composing was rendered commercially obsolete by continuous casting or "hot-metal" typesetting machines, such as the Linotype machine and Monotype at the end of the 19th century. The Linotype, invented by Ottmar Mergenthaler, enabled one machine operator to do the work of ten hand compositors by automating the selection, use and replacement of sorts, with a keyboard as input. Later advances, such as the typewriter or computer, pushed the state of the art even farther ahead. Still, hand composition and letterpress printing did not fall completely out of use. Since the introduction of digital typesetting, it has seen a renewal as an artisanal pursuit. However, it is a very small niche within the larger typesetting market.
Phototypesetting or "cold type" systems first appeared in the early 1960s and rapidly displaced continuous casting machines. These devices consisted of glass disks (one per font) that spun in front of a light source which selectively exposed characters onto light-sensitive paper. Originally they were driven by pre-punched paper tapes. Later they were hooked up to computer front ends.
One of the earliest electronic photocomposition systems was introduced by Fairchild Semiconductor. The typesetter typed a line of text on a Fairchild keyboard that had no display. To verify correct content of the line it was typed a second time. If the two lines were identical a bell rang and the machine produced a punched paper tape corresponding to the text. With the completion of a block of lines the typesetter fed the corresponding paper tapes into a phototypesetting device which mechanically set type outlines printed on glass sheets into place for exposure onto a negative film. Photosensitive paper was exposed to light through the negative film, resulting in a column of black type on white paper, or a galley. The galley was then cut up and used to create a mechanical drawing or paste up of a whole page. A large film negative of the page is shot and used to make a plates for offset printing.
Before the 1980s, almost all typesetting for publishers and advertisers was done by specialist typesetting companies. These companies performed keyboarding, editing and production of paper or film output, and formed a large component of the graphic arts industry. In the United States, these companies were located in rural Pennsylvania, New England or the Midwest where labor was cheap, and paper produced nearby, but still within a few hours' travel time of the major publishing centers.
In 1985, desktop publishing became available, starting with the Apple Macintosh, Aldus PageMaker (and later QuarkXPress) and PostScript. Improvements in software and hardware, and rapidly-lowering costs, popularized desktop publishing and enabled very fine control of typeset results at much lower cost than the minicomputer-based systems. At the same time, word processing systems such as Wang and WordPerfect revolutionized office documents. They did not, however, have the typographic ability or flexibility required for complex book layout, graphics, mathematics, or advanced hyphenation and justification rules ("H and J").
By the year 2000, this industry segment had shrunk because publishers were now capable of integrating typesetting and graphic design on their own in-house computers. Many found that the cost of maintaining high standards of typographic design and technical skill made it more economical to out-source to freelancers and graphic design specialists.
The availability of cheap, or free, fonts made the conversion to do-it-yourself easier but also opened up a gap between skilled designers and amateurs. The advent of PostScript, supplemented by the PDF file format, provided a universal method of proofing designs and layouts, readable on major computer and operating systems.
IBM created and inspired a family of typesetting languages with names that were derivatives of the word "SCRIPT". Latter versions of SCRIPT included advanced features such as automatic generation of a table of contents and index, multi-column page layout, footnotes, boxes, automatic hyphenation and spelling verification.
SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) was based upon GML (IBM Generalized Markup Language). GML was a set of macros on top of IBM SCRIPT.
The arrival of SGML/XML as the document model made other typesetting engines popular. Such engines include Datalogics Pager, Penta, Miles 33's OASYS, Xyvision's XML Professional Publisher (XPP), FrameMaker, Arbortext, YesLogic's Prince, QuarkXPress and Adobe InDesign. These products allow users to program their typesetting process around the SGML/XML with the help of scripting languages. Some of them, such as Arbortext Editor and XMetaL Author, provide attractive WYSIWYG-ish interfaces with support for XML standards and Unicode to attract a wider spectrum of users.
During the mid-1970s Joseph Ossanna, working at Bell Laboratories, wrote the troff (said as "tee-roff") typesetting program to drive a Wang C/A/T phototypesetter owned by the Labs; it was later enhanced by Brian Kernighan to support output to different equipment such as laser printers and the like. While its use has fallen off, it is still included with a number of Unix and Unix-like systems and has been used to typeset a number of high-profile technical and computer books. Some versions, as well as a GNU work-alike called groff, are now open source.
The TeX system, developed by Donald E. Knuth at the end of the 1970s, is another widespread and powerful automated typesetting system which has set high standards, especially for typesetting mathematics.

Swinging London

Swinging London is a catch-all term applied to the fashion and cultural scene which flourished in London, in the 1960s. 
It was a phenomenon which emphasized the young, the new and the modern. It was a period of optimism and hedonism, and a cultural revolution. One catalyst was the recovery of the British economy after post-World War II hard times had lasted through much of the 1950s. Journalist Christopher Booker, a founder of the satirical magazine "Private Eye", recalled the "bewitching" character of the swinging sixties: "There seemed to be no one standing outside the bubble, and observing just how odd and shallow and egocentric and even rather horrible it was".
"Swinging London" was defined by "Time" magazine in its issue of 15 April 1966, and celebrated in the name of the pirate radio station, "Swinging Radio England", that began shortly afterward. However, "swinging" in the sense of hip or fashionable, had been used since the early 1960s. In 1965, Diana Vreeland, editor of "Vogue" magazine, said "London is the most swinging city in the world at the moment".
Although "The Beatles" came from Liverpool, "The Rolling Stones", and the rest of the new culture was London-based. Most of the new fashion designers, models and photographers were young, and packed into a small area in Soho around Carnaby Street, W1., and another area round the King's Road, Chelsea.
During the time of Swinging London, fashion and photography were featured in "Queen" magazine, which drew attention to fashion designer Mary Quant.
The model Jean Shrimpton was another icon and one of the world's first supermodels. She was the world's highest paid and most photographed model of the time. Shrimpton was called "The face of the '60s", in which she has been considered by many as "the symbol of Swinging London", and the "embodiment of the 1960s". Other popular models of the era included Veruschka, and Twiggy. Twiggy was called "the Queen of Mod", a label she shared with others, such as Cathy McGowan, who hosted the television rock show, "Ready Steady Go!" from 1964 to 1966.
Mod-related fashions such as the miniskirt stimulated fashionable shopping areas such as Carnaby Street and the Kings Road, Chelsea. The fashion was a symbol of youth culture.
The British flag, the Union Flag, became a symbol, assisted by events such as England's home victory in the 1966 World Cup. The Mini car (launched in 1959) was used by a fleet of mini-cab taxis highlighted by advertising which covered their paintwork.

Wikipedia:Advanced text formatting

This essay, Wikipedia:Advanced text formatting or Advanced typesetting, describes many techniques to control (or adjust) the alignment of text on a page. For people with professional backgrounds in typesetting, this essay is not intended as a joke, but rather, an advancement over the default typesetting of stub articles. Techniques listed here are still intended for general readers.
Perhaps the single greatest improvement to many articles is to lower those grandstanding top tag-boxes that proclaim, "This article is bad: change it now". Most of those tag-box templates allow a parameter "|section" when lowering the tag-box further down the page. For example: {{codice_1}}. Moving a distracting tag-box can greatly improve the readability for readers, who might otherwise become surprised and alarmed by a 2-year-old gripe box which someone threw on the page, unopposed, years ago. Some tag-boxes give the idea that the box must be read to avoid very dangerous information in an article.
One of the most troublesome typesetting glitches is the wrapping of the last word in a quotation onto a second line, when followed by parentheses or brackets "[ ]":
There are several ways to allow the end-word to stay on the same line, without wrapping. Perhaps the most common fix is to append the blank-code "&#160;" (or even a comma) after the end quotemark so that it will not wrap too soon:
To fix wrapping, the word "dogs" is followed by &#160 (after the quotemark:  dogs"&#160; ). Because thousands of articles begin with formally defining a term, with stating a quoted meaning, the forced wrapping of end-quotemarks has become a major typesetting nightmare in Wikipedia. The wrapping of end-quotes grew to be so common, during 2005-2010, that it has become instinctive to expect an end-quote to almost always be prematurely wrapped onto a second line, and the first line to be truncated as bizarrely too short. The premature wrapping of the 18-character phrase "dogs...typewriter" is typical, not an exaggeration of how much text gets forced onto the second line in many articles.
A similar problem occurs with an end-apostrophe & parentheses:
Besides using "&#160;" other characters, such as comma, semicolon or slash, could be appended after the end-quotemark, if they fit the meaning. There might be other situations of forced wrapping in Wikipedia text.
Lesser text can be reduced to a smaller "font size", such as by using a span-tag:
That font-size will shrink the text somewhat: German: "Der Lange-Annoying-Name-der-Dinge". A highly irritating problem can be the placement of too much foreign (or off-topic text) in the intro section. Much tangent-level wording should be moved to lower sections. However, the use of a reduced font-size can help minimize the glaring impact of off-topic text. Sizes such as 95% or 92% retain the original font shape; however, sizes of 87% or 82% might be needed. To reduce a larger section of text, consider using the paired <div>...</div> tags (instead of "<span>...</span>").
The default small text-size, with almost no shape, is selected by <small>aa bb cc xx yy zz</small>, which appears as: . Using <font face=Georgia>, to switch from default Arial font to Georgia font, the small text will appear as: .
A very common problem, when using a smaller font, is the gapping caused by large interline spacing between the lines. A better line-height (for small-font notes) is: 1.3em, such as by:
Such small lines could be used in a lengthy image caption, where the typical caption size would take too much space, for the amount of detailed caption being displayed. Of course, once again, a full solution often involves removing some excess text (from the image-caption) to a lower spot on the page, and then referring to the image, such as "("see image at right")" from that text.
The colon-indent prefix ":" which indents lines (by about 7 spaces) also triggers a smaller line-height, so any indented wrapped-text will appear closer to the upper-text on the indented line.
Another use of reduced line-height might be for an indented quote-box, where the smaller line-height might help in emphasizing the quote as being a special text section. For example, using:
Then enclose the text of a quote, such as the following:
Sometimes, the setting must be precise, where 1.30em would be too close, or 1.35 would separate lines too much, while 1.33em provides an even balance, for the particular lines in the quotation. Because the line-height is reduced, the effect of the quotation is different than merely indenting the text. Note how the line for author "Einstein" has been indented, far to the right: the new indenter template was used to indent across 32 spaces further than the quoted lines: {{in5|32}}&mdash;Albert...
The opposite technique, of "increased" line-height, might be used for some indented song lyrics (or poetry), where the larger line-height could help in emphasizing the "double-spaced" appearance of a text section. For example, using:
Then enclose the song lyrics as "xxx", with line-breaks <br>, as follows:
Because the line-height is increased, the effect of the quoted text appears similar to having used double-spaced lines in the text. The extra spacing also helps for annotations, such as noting, in the chorus (for the 2008 song "Viva la Vida") how "Roman cavalry" refers to horse-soldiers, while the "choirs are singing" the lines "Be my mirror" (etc.). The length of each line is chosen to reflect the cadence or rhythm of the music, where the singer could take a breath at the end of each line. (Only part of the lyrics are listed, to keep them short, per copyright laws limiting to 10%, or prohibiting the display of an entire performable unit, of a song).
The exact coding of the song lyrics could be a single line, as follows:
For coding on multiple lines, use "<div>" rather than "<span>" tags.
Words can be joined by "&nbsp;" or to force them to appear together, on one line. Sometimes text, next to a wide image-box or wide , tends to get squeezed into a narrow column of text. A very narrow column can cause text-wrapping as, sometimes, one-word-per-line, all the way down the entire column. By word-joining the first few words of a phrase (such as "At&nbsp;the&nbsp;outset"  or  "The&nbsp;region&nbsp;covers"), the text can be forced down the page, into a wider column, where all the joined-words can fit side-by-side, across the line. Then, even when the page is viewed in larger browser Text-Size settings, the joined text will float down to columns where the typesetting looks more logical, rather than the default, of one-word-per-line, in a narrow column.
Bold-faced text can be softened, or thinned, by using dark-gray, rather than typical black, as the text font-color. For example:
The dark-gray color (#666666) will appear as:
One and Two and Three". Compare the bolded text of One/Two, against the stark contrast, of the shortcut title of this essay page: WP:TYPESET.
In Wikipedia, the use of bold-faced text is used, primarily, to highlight words that are titles, or redirected terms, that name each article. Such bold-faced text could be confusing when not connected to the article title, so the use of a lighter bolded text allows for highlighting, with less confusion about the article-title words.
Also, other, lively colors could be bolded without much confusion with the article-title words ("see color choices in:" Web colors).
Text can be auto-indented, depending on screen width, using ":" followed by "&nbsp;" as follows:
The indented line will indent less, on a narrow screen, because the non-breaking spaces will be on an upper line, and the text will shift to the next line. The result will appear as:
The reason for auto-indenting: sometimes, text needs to be indented on wide screens but not indented, as much, on narrow windows because it would not fit across the line, if fully indented on a narrow window. This is typically the case for a long math equation or formula, such as the following:
The generated formula will appear as:
On a very-narrow window, then the formula would auto-indent with less left-side spacing.
Such use of auto-indented text is, typically, rare, but can avoid large text-gaps where the page would become half-blank on a narrow window. Otherwise, many long equations (especially, near images or ) would be shifted down a page, causing a wide text-gap to appear, because they would be too long to fit when fully indented.
The MediaWiki markup language supports many HTML tags, including "<font face=Garamond>" and such. Some of the fonts are:
Adding commas, and repeating key-phrases, can clarify many long, complex sentences. Consider the following text:
The above text tends to run together, with the result of seeming to be too long for a proper sentence. However, consider the addition of some commas, and also, repeating some words:
The commas clearly separate the long sentence into specific phrases. The subject of "vending machines on dark side-streets" is clarified, at the end, by repeating "on dark side-streets" which readers might have forgotten, since that was the 2nd phrase in the long sentence. By using the trick of adding commas and repeating key-phrases, many long sentences can appear clarified, without extensive re-writing. The commas act, almost like magic, to simplify a long sentence, without the need to drastically cut and reword the text to be easier to read. The term "whereas" was used to be more specific than the word "where" (other similar precise terms, used to help clarify, include "instead" or "rather than" ). Often, it is not necessary to re-write technical articles for better clarity; instead, just add several commas and see if an article can be easily clarified, within minutes, rather than spend hours re-writing, or splitting, the technical descriptions.
Real typesetting software, for over 30 years, typically has had simple directives to trigger alignments as left, right, center, or "undented" (beyond the left-margin line). However, for decades, HTML has had only limited options for easy alignment (one: <center>). A method for undenting the first word of a paragraph is to put the paragraph into a text-table, where the first word (or syllable) is (alone) in column 1, while the other text is in column 2. For example, undenting "Beethoven":
Note the use of both "cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0" so as to not separate the spacing between the first syllable "Bee" and "thoven".
A third column can be used to enclose text in outside brackets, then putting the closing-bracket "]" in column 3, as follows:
Again, the designers of the HTML language had only limited knowledge of typesetting (thus they invented: font size=1 to 5!), so the only alignment directive was "<center>". However, the currently invalid options "<left>" and "<right>" could be added someday, as a trivial implementation, because to handle "center" then the left/right margins must already be known to the computer. The pitfalls of HTML, developed with little knowledge of typesetting (or even of computer languages), are typical when amateurs (or college dropouts) try to create a new technology. Note that there are some examples of the opposite effect: such as an opera singer (Luciano Pavarotti) learning to sing well without being able to read music. However, in general, most attempts by hacks are botched failures. It is important to seek the knowledge of experts, but hacks might not even understand the basics that experts know, so some humility is needed in such discussions.

When Watkins Glen left the F1 schedule after 1980, the Caesars Palacd GP took its place. The track was set up in the parking lot of the Caesars Palace hotel. It was surprisingly well set up for a temporary circuit. It was wide enough for passing, provided ample run-off areas filled with sand, and had a surface that was as smooth as glass.

<doc id="264285" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264285" title="Kakadu National Park">
Kakadu National Park

Kakadu National Park is in the Northern Territory of Australia, 171 km southeast of Darwin. It is the second largest national park in the world. It covers an area of . It is about 200 kilometres from north to south, and more than 100 kilometres from east to west. It is the size of Slovenia, about one-third the size of Tasmania, or nearly half the size of Switzerland. The Ranger Uranium Mine, one of the biggest Uranium mines in the world, is inside the park.
The name Kakadu comes from "Gagadju", the name of an Aboriginal language spoken in the northern part of the Park. Kakadu National Park has many different ecological areas, and many different plant and animal species. The main natural features protected within the National Park include:
Kakadu National Park is famous for the richness of its Aboriginal cultural sites. There are more than 5000 recorded art sites showing Aboriginal culture over thousands of years. The archaeological sites show that Aboriginals have lived here for at least 20 000 and possibly up to 40 000 years.
The cultural and natural values of Kakadu National Park were recognised internationally when the Park was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is an international list of places that are have outstanding cultural or natural values of international significance. Kakadu was listed in three stages: Stage 1 in 1981, Stage 2 in 1987, and the entire Park in 1992.
About half of the land in Kakadu is aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. Most of the remaining land is currently under claim by Aboriginal people. The areas of the Park that are owned by Aboriginal people are leased by the traditional owners to the Director of National Parks to be managed as a national park. The remaining area is Australian Government land controlled by the Director of National Parks. All of Kakadu is declared a national park under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.
The Aboriginal traditional owners of the Park are descendants of various clan groups from the Kakadu area. Their lifestyle has changed in recent years, but their traditional customs and beliefs remain very important. About 500 Aboriginal people live in the Park; many of them are traditional owners. All of Kakadu is jointly managed by Aboriginal traditional owners and the Australian Government’s Department of the Environment and Water Resources through a division known as Parks Australia. Park Management is directed by the Kakadu Board of Management.
Kakadu was set up at a time when Australians were becoming more interested in national parks for conservation and in recognising the land rights of Aboriginal people. A national park in the Alligator River region was proposed as early as 1965. In 1978 the Australian Government took over the titles of various pieces of land that now makes up Kakadu National Park.
Kakadu National Park was made a park in three stages between 1979 and 1991. Each stage of the Park includes Aboriginal land under the Land Rights Act that is leased to the Director of National Parks or land that is subject to a claim to traditional ownership under the Land Rights Act. Most of the land that was to become part of Stage One of Kakadu was given to the Kakadu Aboriginal Land Trust under the Land Rights Act in August 1978. In November 1978, the Land Trust and the Director signed a lease for the land to be managed as a national park. Stage One of the Park was declared on 5 April 1979.
Stage Two was declared on 28 February 1984. In March 1978, a claim was lodged under the Land Rights Act for the land included in Stage Two of Kakadu. The land claim was partly successful. In 1986, three areas in the eastern part of Stage Two were given to the Jabiluka Aboriginal Land Trust. A lease between the Land Trust and the Director of National parks was signed in March 1991.
In 1987, a land claim was made for the land in the Goodparla and Gimbat pastoral leases that were to be included in Stage Three of Kakadu. The other area to be included in Stage Three, the Gimbat Resumption and the Waterfall Creek Reserve, were later added to this land claim. The need to create the park in stages was due to the debate over whether mining should be allowed at Guratba (Coronation Hill) which is located in the middle of the area referred to as Sickness Country. The traditional owners’ wishes were ultimately respected and the Australian National Government decided that there would be no mining at Guratba.
In 1996, the land in Stage Three, apart from the former Goodparla pastoral leases, was given to the Gunlom Aboriginal Land Trust and leased to the Director of National Parks to continue being managed as part of Kakadu.
The Chinese, Malays and Portuguese all claim to have been the first non-Aboriginal explorers of Australia’s north coast. The first surviving written account comes from the Dutch. In 1623 Jan Carstenz made his way west across the Gulf of Carpentaria to what is believed to be Groote Eylandt. Abel Tasman was the next explorer to visit in 1644. He was the first person to record European contact with Aboriginal people. Almost a century later Matthew Flinders surveyed the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1802 and 1803.
Phillip Parker King, an English navigator entered the Gulf of Carpentaria between 1818 and 1822. During this time he named the three Alligator Rivers after the large numbers of crocodiles, which he thought were alligators.
Ludwig Leichhardt was the first land-based European explorer to visit the Kakadu region, in 1845 on his way from Moreton Bay in Queensland to Port Essington in the Northern Territory. He followed Jim Jim Creek down from the Arnhem Land escarpment, then went down the South Alligator before crossing to the East Alligator and going north.
In 1862 John McDouall Stuart travelled along the south-western boundary of Kakadu but did not see any people.
The first non-Aboriginal people to visit and have long term contact with Aboriginal people in northern Australia were the Macassans from Sulawesi and other parts of Indonesia. They travelled to northern Australia every wet season, probably from the last quarter of the 17th century, in sailing boats called praus. They came to harvest trepang (sea cucumber), turtle shell, pearls and other prized items to trade in their homeland. Aboriginal people helped in harvesting and processing the trepang, and in collecting and exchanging the other goods.
There is no evidence that the Macassans spent time on the coast of Kakadu. There is evidence of some contact between Macassan culture and Aboriginal people of the Kakadu area. Among the finds from archaeological digs in the Park are glass and metal pieces that probably came from the Macassans, either directly or through trade with the Coburg Peninsula people.
The British attempted a number of settlements on the northern Australian coast in the
early part of the 19th century: Fort Dundas on Melville Island in 1824; Fort Wellington at Raffles Bay in 1829; and Victoria Settlement (Port Essington) on the Coburg Peninsula in 1838. They wanted to secure the north of Australia before the French or Dutch, who had colonised islands further north. The British settlements all failed for a variety of reasons, such as lack of water and fresh food, sickness and isolation.
It is difficult to assess the impact of these settlements on the local Aboriginal people and the type of relationship that developed between them and the British. Certainly, some Aboriginals worked at the settlements. Exposure to new sickness was an ever-present danger. As in other parts of Australia, disease and the disruption it caused to society devastated the local Aboriginal population.
Water buffalo have had a big influence on the Kakadu region as well. By the 1880s the number of buffaloes escaped from early settlements had grown so much that hunting them for skins and horns was economically successful.
The industry began on the Adelaide River, close to Darwin, and moved east to the Mary River and Alligator Rivers regions.
Most of the buffalo hunting and skin curing was done in the dry season, between June and September, when buffaloes gathered around the remaining billabongs. During the wet season hunting stopped because the ground was too muddy to follow the buffalo and the harvested hides would rot. The buffalo hunting industry became an important employer of Aboriginal people during the dry-season months.
Missionaries had a big influence on the Aboriginal people of the Alligator Rivers area. Many of the people lived and went to school at missions. Two missions were set up in the region in the early part of the century. Kapalga Native Industrial Mission was started near the South Alligator River in 1899, but lasted only four years. The Oenpelli Mission began in 1925, when the Church of England Missionary Society accepted an offer from the Northern Territory Administration to take over the area, which had been used as a dairy farm. The Oenpelli Mission operated for 50 years.
Some writers and anthropologists say that missionaries, in trying to ‘civilise and institutionalise’ Aboriginal people, forced them to give up their lifestyle, language, religion, ceremonies and change the whole way they lived. Others say that, although they might not have used the best methods to achieve their goal, the missionaries did care about the Aboriginal people at a time when wider Australian society did not. 
The pastoral industry made started slowly in the Top End. Pastoral leases in the Kakadu area were progressively given up from 1889, because the Victoria River and the Barkly Tablelands were better pastoral regions.
In southern Kakadu much of Goodparla and Gimbat was claimed in the mid-1870s by three pastoralists, Roderick, Travers and Sergison. The leases were later passed on to a series of owners, who were all unsuccessful. In 1987 both stations were taken back by the Commonwealth and added to Kakadu National Park.
There was a sawmill at Nourlangie Camp, begun by Chinese workers, probably before World War I, to cut stands of cypress pine in the area. After World War II there were a number of small-scale activities, including dingo shooting and trapping, brumby shooting, crocodile shooting, tourism and forestry.
Nourlangie Camp was again the site of a sawmill in the 1950s, until the cypress pines were cleared. In 1958 it became a safari camp for tourists. Soon after, a similar camp was started at Patonga and at Muirella Park. People were flown in to hunt buffalo, crocodiles and fishing.
Crocodile hunters often made use of the bush skills of Aboriginal people. By copying a wallaby’s tail hitting the ground, Aboriginal hunters could attract crocodiles, making it easier to shoot the animals. Using paperbark rafts, they would track the movement of a wounded crocodile and get the carcass for skinning. The skins were then sold to make leather goods. Aboriginal people became less involved in commercial hunting of crocodiles once night spotlight shooting started. Freshwater Crocodiles have been protected by law since 1964 and Saltwater Crocodiles since 1971.
Minerals were found in the Top End during the building of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line line between 1870 and 1872, in the Pine Creek – Adelaide River area. A number of short mining booms followed.
The building of the North Australia Railway line helped the mining camps, and places such as Burrundie and Pine Creek became permanent settlements. The mining camps and new settlements drew many Aboriginal people away from Kakadu. No Aboriginal people are known to have worked in the mines but their access to alcohol and other drugs had a huge impact.
Small-scale gold mining began at Imarlkba, near Barramundi Creek, and Mundogie Hill in the 1920s and at Moline (previously called Eureka and Northern Hercules mine), south of the Park, in the 1930s. The mines employed a few local Aboriginal people.
In 1953 uranium was discovered in the South Alligator River valley. Thirteen small but rich uranium mines operated in the following decade, at their peak in 1957 employing over 150 workers. No Aboriginal people were employed at any of these mines.
Early in the 1970s large uranium deposits were discovered at Ranger, Jabiluka and Koongarra. The Australian Government began an inquiry into land use in the Alligator Rivers region. The Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry (known as the Fox inquiry) recommended that mining begin at the Ranger site. It also said that Jabiluka and Koongarra sites should be developed, and that a town be built to support the mines.(Fox et al. 1976, 1977). The Ranger mine and the service town at Jabiru have had many impacts on Aboriginal people. Aboriginal people have different opinions about mining.
Kakadu is in the tropics, between 12° and 14° south of the Equator. The climate is monsoonal, 
with two main seasons: the dry season and the rain season. The 'build up' describes the change between the dry and the rain. During the dry season (from April/May to September), there are dry southerly and easterly trade winds. Humidity is relatively low and rain is unusual. At Jabiru, the average maximum temperature for June-July is 32 °C. During the 'build up' (October to December) conditions can be extremely uncomfortable with high temperatures and high humidity. However, 'build up' storms are impressive and with many lightning strikes. At Jabiru the average maximum temperature for October is 37.5 °C.
The rain season (January to March/April) has warm temperatures and rain. Most of the rain is caused by monsoonal troughs formed over Southeast Asia. Sometimes tropical cyclones cause very heavy rain over small areas. At Jabiru, the average maximum temperature for January is 33 °C. Annual rainfall in Kakadu National Park ranges from 1,565 mm in Jabiru to 1,300 mm in the Mary River region.
The Aboriginal people, the Bininj/Mungguy, named as many as six seasons in the Kakadu region:
Periods of torrential rain and long dry spells mean that Kakadu can change its appearance according to the season, so is a place deserving of more than one visit.
Kakadu has more than 2000 plant species, because of the different geological areas, landforms and habitats. Kakadu is also said to be one of the most weed free national parks in the world.
The different geographical areas of Kakadu have their own specialised plants. The area called ‘the Stone Country’ has ‘resurrection grasses’ that are able to survive extreme heat, and dry conditions followed by periods of heavy rain. Monsoon forests often develop in the cool moist gorges found in the stone country. The southern hills and basins support several endemic plants that are only found in Kakadu such as "Eucalyptus koolpinensis" near Jarrangbarnmi (Koolpin Gorge). Lowland areas form a large proportion of Kakadu National Park and are mainly covered in eucalypt-dominated open woodland with the ground layer consisting of a large range of grasses including spear grass, sedges and wildflowers.
The floodplains, which are flooded for several months each year, feature sedges such as spike rush as well patches of freshwater mangroves (itchy tree), pandanus and paper bark trees (Melaleuca). Varieties of water lilies, such as the blue, yellow and white snowflake, are commonly found in these areas. Estuaries and tidal flats are populated with varieties of mangroves, in fact 39 of the 47 Northern Territory species of mangrove are found in Kakadu. These are important for preventing erosion of the coast. Mangroves serve as feeding and breeding grounds for many fish species including the barramundi.
On the tidal flats behind the mangroves, hardy succulents (samphire), grasses and sedges grow. Isolated pockets of monsoon forest grow along the coast and river banks. These forests contain several impressive trees, among them the banyan fig, which can be recognised by its large, spreading aerial roots, and the kapok tree, which has a spiny trunk, large, waxy red flowers and pods full of cotton-like material.
The different areas of Kakadu National Park support a huge number of animals, a number of which have adapted to particular habitats. Some animals in the Park are rare, endangered, vulnerable or endemic. Because of the extreme weather conditions experienced in the Park, many animals are active only at particular times of the day or night or at particular times of the year.
About 62 mammal species have been seen in the Park. Most of them live in the open forest and woodlands and are nocturnal, making it difficult to see them. Others, such as wallabies and kangaroos are active in the cooler parts of the day and are easier to see. The larger mammals are Dingos, Antilopine Kangaroos, Black Wallaroos, Agile Wallabys, and Short-eared Rock Wallabys. Smaller common mammals are northern quolls, brush-tailed phascogales, brown bandicoots, black-footed tree-rats, and black fruit bats. Dugongs are found in the coastal waters. However, recent surveys have shown smaller numbers of nearly all mammals throughout Kakadu. This includes once common and widespread species such as northern quolls.
Kakadu’s many habitats support more than 280 species of birds. This is about one-third of Australia’s bird species. Some birds range over a number of habitats, but many are found in only one environment.
To date, 123 species of reptiles have been found in Kakadu. Being cold blooded, these animals need heat from an external source such as the sun to control their body temperature. This is not to say that reptiles are active only during the day; in fact, few snakes can withstand Kakadu’s midday heat and most are active at night. 
Two species of crocodile live in Kakadu: the Freshwater Crocodile ("Crocodylus johnstonii") and the Estuarine, or Saltwater Crocodile ("C. porosus"). Freshwater Crocodiles have a narrow snout and a single row of four large boney lumps called ‘scutes’ immediately behind the head. Estuarine Crocodiles do not have these scutes and their snout is broader. The maximum size for a ‘freshie’ is 3 metres, whereas a ‘saltie’ can exceed 6 metres.
Kakadu’s 25 frog species are extremely well adapted to the region’s climatic extremes. Many remain dormant during dry times. At the start of the wet season, when the billabongs and swamps start to fill with water, the night air is filled with the sounds of frogs such as the northern bullfrog and the marbled frog. As the water builds up, frogs and tadpoles have plenty of food, such as algae, vegetation, insects, dragonfly nymphs, and other tadpoles. Not all of Kakadu’s frogs are found in the wetlands: many live in the lowland forests.
Fifty-one species of freshwater fish have been found in Kakadu’s waterways; eight of them have a restricted distribution. In the Magela Creek system alone, 32 species have been found. In comparison, the Murray–Darling river system, the most extensive in Australia, now supports only 27 native fish species. Although introduced fish have been found in most Australian waterways, none have been recorded in the Park.
Kakadu supports more than 10,000 species of insect including grasshoppers, beetles, flies, termites, butterflies and moths, bees, wasps, ants, dragonflies and damselflies, caddis flies, non-biting midges and mayflies. The great variety of insects is a result of the varied habitats and relatively high temperatures throughout the year.
Perhaps the most striking insect-created features in the Park are the termite mounds. The mounds in the southern part of the Park are particularly large and impressive. Leichhardt’s grasshopper, in colours of orange, blue and black, is perhaps the most spectacular insect found in Kakadu. It is also found on the Arnhem Land plateau and in Gregory National Park.
Kakadu has seen several invasive species threaten the native habitat, particularly in recent decades. Introduced fauna including the Water Buffalo, wild pig and more recently, the Cane Toad have had major effects on habitat. Invasive weeds include "Mimosa pigra", which covers 800 km² of the Top End, including vast areas of Kakadu, invasive paragrass displaces the native food of much of Kakadu's birdlife. "Salvinia molesta" has infested the Magela floodplain. Brumbies also inhabit areas of the National Park, including Yellow Water.
There are six main landforms in Kakadu National Park: 
Each landform has its own range of habitats. Kakadu’s varied landscapes and the habitats they contain are features that contributed to its listing as a World Heritage Area.
Most of Kakadu was under a shallow sea about 140 million years ago, with the escarpment wall formed from sea cliffs and Arnhem Land from a flat plateau above the sea. Currently the escarpment rises 330 metres above the plateau and stretches 500 kilometres along the East edge of the park and on into Arnhem Land. The escarpment varies from near vertical cliffs in the Jim Jim Falls area to isolated outliers and stepped cliffs in the North.
Chasms and gorges form a network that cut through the rocky platforms on the plateau. The plateau top is a harsh, dry environment where water drains away quickly and top soil is scarce in most areas. Sparse pockets of open forest and woodlands have developed in these areas. However creeks have carved deep gorges in the escarpment in which tall monsoon forests grow. These areas form microclimates for plants and animals and often serve as a refuge during the dry season. Allosyncarpia ternata, a large shady tree found only in the Kakadu and Arnhem Land, is the main plant species.
The outliers are pieces of the Arnhem Land plateau that have become separated from the plateau by erosion. They were islands in the ancient seas that once covered much of Kakadu. The lowland plains stretch over much of the Top End and they make up nearly 70% of the Park. The soils are shallow and often are above large sheets of laterite (ironstone) and a thick profile of strongly leached rocks.
During the wet season, water carried down from the Arnhem Land plateau often overflows from creeks and rivers onto nearby floodplains. Alluvial soils carried in the floodwaters add nutrients to the floodplains. Nutrient-rich soils along with an abundance of water and sunlight make the floodplains an area of prolific plant and animal life. During the dry season the water drains into rivers, creeks and isolated waterholes or billabongs. Kakadu’s wetlands are listed under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (the Ramsar Convention) for their outstanding ecological, botanical, zoological and hydrological features.
The southern hills and basins cover a large area in the south of the Park, including the headwaters of the South Alligator River. Rocks here have been exposed from beneath the retreating Arnhem escarpment; they are of volcanic origin and are extremely old (2500 million years). This landform is characterised by rugged strike ridges separated by alluvial flats.
Kakadu’s coast and the creeks and river systems under tidal influence (extending about 100 kilometres inland) make up this landform. The shape of the estuaries and tidal flats varies considerably from the dry season to the wet season. During the dry season tidal action deposits silt along the river beds and banks. During the wet season the river beds are eroded by the floodwaters and large quantities of fresh and saline water flow out across the tidal flats, where silt is deposited. Large silt loads are also carried out to sea, some of the silt being deposited as a nutrient rich layer on the sea floor, contributing to the muddy waters that characterise Kakadu’s coastline.
The estuaries and tidal flats are home to many plants and animals adapted to living in the oxygen-deficient saline mud. The dominant habitats are mangrove swamps and samphire flats. Where freshwater springs occur along the coasts and river banks, isolated pockets of coastal monsoon rainforests form.
The art sites of Ubirr, Nourlangie Rock and Nanguluwur are world famous as examples of Aboriginal rock art. These sites are found among the rocks that have given shelter to the Aborigines for thousands of years. The painting in these rock shelters were done for different reasons:
Ubirr is a group of rock outcrops in the northest of the Park, on the edge of the Nadab floodplain. There are several large rock overhangs that would have provided excellent shelter to Aboriginal people over thousands of years. Because it is close to the East Alligator River and Nadab floodplains, it means that there would have been plenty of food. This is shown in much of the rock art here. Animals shown in the main gallery include barramundi, catfish, mullet, goanna, snake-necked turtle, pig-nosed turtle, Rock-haunting Ringtail Possum, and wallaby and thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger).
There are also images of the Rainbow Serpent said to have created much of the landscape as well as mischievous Mimi spirits and the story of the Namarrgarn Sisters. Many stories connected to Aboriginal rock are highly complex and linked to other stories. Often the true meanings have been lost, but they all have a purpose which is usually to serve as a lesson or a warning to the young or to those passing through the area.
Nourlangie is located in an outlying formation of the Arnhem Land Escarpment. There are a number of shelters in this large outcrop linked by paths and stairways. The shelters contain several impressive paintings that deal with the Dreamtime. The stories connected to these artworks are known only to certain Aboriginal people and remain secret.
Anbangbang Billabong lies in the shadow of Nourlangie Rock and is home to a wide range of wildlife which would have sustained traditional Aboriginal people well.
Nanguluwur, a small art site near Nourlangie, has several rock art styles. These include hand stencils, dynamic figures in large head-dresses carrying spears and boomerangs, Namandi spirits and mythical figures, including Alkajko, a female spirit with four arms and horns. There is also an interesting example of ‘contact art’ showing a two-masted sailing ship with anchor chain and a dinghy trailing behind.
Humans have made major changes in the area during the 19th and 20th century. Introduction of water buffalo from Southeast Asia caused damage to the fragile floodplains and wetlands. Since then, buffalo have largely been removed from the area so the land is now recovering. Crocodile hunting which has been banned since 1972 made a huge impact on crocodile numbers. Since they have been protected, the crocodiles have recovered so successfully that some think there are now too many.
Mining has made changes to the landscape, but only one uranium mine (Ranger) remains. Mine operators are have to repair and replant the area when the mine closes. Some small scale logging took place in the early part of the 20th century, but little evidence of this remains. Tourism causes big changes to Kakadu National Park with hundreds of thousands of visitors arriving annually. Roads, tracks, signs, shelter, accommodation, telecommunications and other services must be provided to support this activity.
Fire is part of the landscape of Kakadu National Park. The Park has large areas of woodland and grassy plains that are subject to long periods of dry hot weather. The flora of the region has adapted to frequent fires. Fires in northern Australia are less threatening than in southern Australia as many of the trees are largely fire resistant while other plants simply grow back very quickly.
Controlled burning is practiced by the national park in consultation with traditional owners who have used fire as a land management tool for thousands of years. Fire is an important hunting tool for Aboriginal people using it to flush out prey. The other benefit is that once the fire has gone through an area the tender shoots of the fast regenerating grasses attract wallabies into a clearly defined area. Birds of prey such as Whistling Kites also rely on fire to flush out small animals and are usually found in large numbers circling a fire front. Other species such as white-throated grasswrens have declined because of too many fires. Aboriginal people understand that fire is necessary to ‘clean up’ the landscape and believe that many small fires are preferable to one large fire.
Kakadu National Park is a major tourist attraction in Australia’s north with more than 200,000 visitors a year. Kakadu’s dramatic landscape, Aboriginal cultural significance and diverse and abundant wildlife are what visitors come to see. There are many beautiful waterfalls and gorges within the Park that are popular with visitors such as Maguk, Gunlom, Twin Falls and Jim Jim Falls.
Kakadu National Park has some of the best examples of Aboriginal rock art in Australia. The sites of Nourlangie and Ubirr are among the most visited locations in the Park. It is possible to view some of Kakadu’s diverse wildlife at places like Yellow Water Billabong, Cooinda on board a wildlife cruise or at Mamukala Wetlands or Anbangbang Billabong. The Kakadu region is one of the world’s best for bird watching as about 30% of Australia’s bird species can be seen here. 
Large saltwater crocodiles are also common at Yellow Water and the East Alligator River. The Crocodile Dundee movies were made here. Visitors need to be careful around crocodiles as they have been responsible for a number of fatal attacks. Fishing is a popular activity inside Kakadu National Park. The main species is Barramundi and the most popular locations are Yellow Water, the South Alligator and the East Alligator River. Hunting is not allowed in Kakadu National Park.
There are several places to stay in the Park, mostly found in the town of Jabiru, as well as a range of services to cater to visitor’s needs. Visitors can experience Kakadu National Park with a recognised tour operator or they can drive themselves. Many of the Park’s sites are can be reached by standard two wheel drive vehicles, but areas like Twin and Jim Jim Falls and Gunlom require four wheel drive vehicles. Visitors can experience Kakadu National Park via the Nature’s Way tourism drive which is a loop from Darwin to Jabiru then onto Katherine and back to Darwin covering about 900 km.
The Park is proclaimed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the EPBC Act) and is managed through a joint management arrangement between the Aboriginal traditional owners and the Director of National Parks. The Director manages Commonwealth national parks through Parks Australia, which is a part of the Department of the Environment and Water Resources. Title to Aboriginal land in the Park is held by Aboriginal land trusts. The land trusts have leased their land to the Director of National Parks for the purpose of a national park for the enjoyment and benefit of all Australians and international visitors. Traditional owners have also expected that having their land managed as a national park would assist them in looking after their land in the face of growing and competing pressures. They saw a national park as establishing a way to manage the land that could protect their interests and be sympathetic to their aspirations. Parks Australia and the Aboriginal traditional owners of Kakadu are committed to the principle of joint management of the Park and arrangements to help this happen are highlighted in Kakadu’s Plan of Management.
The EPBC Act provides for boards of management to be established for parks on Aboriginal land. The Kakadu Board of Management, which has an Aboriginal majority (ten out of fifteen members), representing the Aboriginal traditional owners of land in the Park, was established in 1989. The Board determines policy for managing the Park and is responsible, along with the Director, for preparing plans of management for the Park. The Plan of Management is the main policy document for the Park and strives to balance strategic or long-term goals and tactical or day to day goals.
Day to day management of Kakadu is carried out by people employed by Parks Australia, which is a branch of the Australian Government’s Department of the Environment and Water Resources. Approximately one-third of the staff in Kakadu are Aboriginal people.
Kakadu National Park brought in an entry fee in April 2010. Money raised will help manage the natural and cultural values of the park environment and improve visitor services.
Like many World Heritage sites around the world, including Yellowstone National Park, Serengeti National Park, Stonehenge, Pompeii and Herculaneum and the Pyramids of Giza - a park use fee will help maintain world-best management practices and facilities for the more than 200,000 visitors who experience Kakadu each year.
The $25 fee will apply to all interstate and international visitors aged 16 years and over. It can be used for 14 days. All Northern Territory residents and children under 16 have free entry.
Kakadu National Park is linked to Darwin by the Arnhem Highway and to Pine Creek and Katherine by the Kakadu Highway. Both roads are sealed all weather roads although may be cut off periodically during periods of heavy rain.
The town of Jabiru has several accommodation options, a service station, police, a medical clinic and a shopping centre with a range of outlets. The town was built for the Uranium mine that was established prior to the founding of Kakadu National Park and provides infrastructure for the mine’s workforce as well as the national park activities and tourism. Jabiru has a small airport from which scenic flights operate daily. There are no scheduled air services between Jabiru and Darwin however.
Other small tourism centres such as Cooinda and South Alligator provide limited facilities. Cooinda, 50 km south of Jabiru on the Kakadu Highway is the site of Gagudju Lodge Cooinda, Yellow Water Cruises and the Warradjan Cultural Centre. Fuel and limited provisions are available at Cooinda and there is also a small airstrip for scenic flights. South Alligator approximately 40 km west of Jabiru on the Arnhem Highway includes a hotel and service station. The Border Store near Ubirr Art Site and Cahills Crossing, 50 km north of Jabiru, is a general store.
There are a wide variety of designated camping sites throughout the Park. Jabiru, Cooinda and South Alligator all have commercial camping areas and are close to most of the important natural attractions in these areas. Some of the Park’s campsites charge a nominal fee as these have shower and toilet facilities, others are free, however they have limited or no facilities. A list of the sites can be obtained from the Kakadu National Park’s Glenn Murcutt-designed Bowali Visitor Centre or from their website.

Detroit Grand Prix

The Detroit Grand Prix is a car racing event held in Detroit, Michigan, USA. From 1982 to 1988 it was a part of the Formula One series. It has been a part of the IndyCar Series since 1988.
In 1982, the U.S. became the first country to host three World Championship Grands Prix in one season. As of 2010, it is the only one to do so. In addition to the US GP West and Caesars Palace GP races, the new event was held on another street course, in the Renaissance Center of Detroit. 
The original circuit had seventeen corners in 2.493 miles, and included a tunnel and a railroad track crossing. For 1989, it was planned to move the Grand Prix to a new circuit at Belle Isle. However, an agreement could not be reached, and the Grand Prix moved to Phoenix in 1989. Upon the departure of F1, the Detroit race was replaced by an event sanctioned by CART, which was held on the same track except the 18th turn, a chicane, was removed. In 1992, the race was moved to Belle Isle, an island in the Detroit River. Since then, the race has been held at Belle Isle. It was canceled after the 2001 race before being held in 2007 and 2008. The race returned for 2012 and has been on the IndyCar series schedule since.

Anna Bolena

Anna Bolena is an Italian opera in two acts. Gaetano Donizetti wrote the music to a libretto by Felice Romani. The opera was first performed in Milan, on December 26, 1830. "Anna Bolena" was Donizetti's thirty-third opera. It was his first major success, and the work that established his reputation in Europe. The opera was long neglected until it was revived to great acclaim by Maria Callas at La Scala in Milan in 1957. It has since been regularly performed, notably by Joan Sutherland, Montserrat Caballé and Beverly Sills. 
The action takes place in England in 1536. The opera relates the stormy relationship between King Henry VIII and his second wife Anne Boleyn, and the king's new romantic interest in Jane Seymour. Anne is accused of treason and adultery and executed to make way for Jane to become his third wife.

Some ideas shown here are beyond the basics listed in the English Wikipedia help-page "" which has explanations for almost all basic options of table formatting, also showing examples of each.
A very quick way to make multiple columns of text is as follows:
However, readers often like an up/down listing of data, down each column.<br>A border can be added with style="border:1px solid #BBB":
Note that the common background color is lighter, so a shade of light-bluegreen can be specified on each row (each line across the table), using hex-color code "#fafeff" (or ), although the color might not matter in large lists:
Even though the coding might seem a little awkward, the results are easily controlled for spacing and alignment. The width of the table will, by default, remain the same for wider or narrowed windows, retaining the alignment with the left-side text (or section titles) outside the table.
Each row (line across the table) can be compressed, as a single line, by joining columns with double-bars "||" between them and ending each row with "<tr>".codice_1
This is done sometimes because it can be easier to re-arrange or pre-view rows that are written as separate lines of text. Multiple columns are joined by double-bars "||" between them, while each single-bar "|" along a line allows a format-specifier before each data-item which ends at a double-bar. However, the wikitable code for a new row, bar-dash ("|-"), must be omitted by adding "<tr>" at the "end" of the prior row above it. The final row does not need an ending "<tr>".
A table can be used to wrap an image, so that the table can float towards the center of the page (such as using: style="float: right;"). However, the table margins, border and font-size must be exactly set to match the average image display. The Image-spec parameter "thumb|" (although auto-thumbnailing to user-settings width) forces a wide left-margin that squeezes the nearby text, so the parameter "center|" can be added to suppress the left-margin padding. However, "center" sometimes shoves the caption to a 2nd line (under a centered box "[]"), so "thumb|" could be omitted and just hard-code the image size, adding a gray (#BBB) border. Using precise parameters to match other images, a floating-image table can be coded as follows:
The text inside the floating-table is sized by style="font-size:86%" (similar in size to the regular image captions). That floating-image table floats a typical image-box, but also allows setting the left-hand margin of the image (see temple-example floating below).
The caption-text could be omitted, or just remove the parameter "thumb|" so the caption will be hidden until shown by "mouse-over display". Unfortunately the parameter "thumb|" (used for displaying the caption) also controls the auto-thumbnailing to re-size images by user-preferences size (default thumbnail size was 180px, then after 2009, became 220px). In March 2010, it was not possible to have auto-thumbnail sizing while also concealing the caption: instead, parameter "thumb|" triggers both actions and forces the caption to display underneath the image.
An image set with parameter "left|" will gain a wide right-side margin (opposite margin of parameter "right|"), so floating toward the left would require an image set as "center|" inside a table with style="float:left; margin:0.46em 0.2em".
Recall that, outside an image-table, the parameter "right|" causes an image to align (either) above or below an infobox, but would not float alongside the infobox. For that reason, many images beside an infobox are typically set as "left|" to align along the left-margin, rather than floated into the center of the page.
Note the "order of precedence" from the right margin: first, come infoboxes or images using "right|", then come the floating-tables, and lastly, any text will wrap that can still fit. If the first text-word is too long, no text will fit to complete the left-hand side, so beware creating a "ragged left margin" when not enough space remains for text to fit alongside floating-tables.
If multiple single image-tables are stacked, they will float to align across the page, depending on page-width. The text will be squeezed to allow as many floating-tables as can fit, as auto-aligned, then wrap whatever text (can still fit) at the left-hand side.
That auto-aligning feature can be used to create a "floating-gallery" of images: a set of 20 floating-tables will wrap (backward, right-to-left) as if each table were a word of text to wrap across and down the page. To wrap in the typical direction (wrapping left-to-right) define all those floating-tables, instead, as left-side tables using the top parameter style="float:left; margin:0.46em 0.2em". Multiple floating-images empower more flexible typesetting of images around the text.
Real typesetting software, for over 30 years, typically has had simple directives to trigger alignments as left, right, center, or "undented" (beyond the left-margin line). However, for decades, HTML has had only limited options for easy alignment (one: <center>). A method for undenting the first word of a paragraph is to put the paragraph into a text-table, where the first word (or syllable) is (alone) in column 1, while the other text is in column 2.
Note the use of both "cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0" so as to not separate the spacing between the first syllable "Bee" and "thoven".
A third column can be used to enclose text in outside brackets, then putting the closing-bracket "]" in column 3, as follows:
Again, the designers of the HTML language had only limited knowledge of typesetting (such as: font size=1 to 5!), so the only alignment directive was "<center>". However, the currently invalid options "<left>" and "<right>" could be added someday, as a trivial implementation, because to handle "center" then left/right must already be known to the computer. The pitfalls of HTML, developed with little knowledge of typesetting (or even of computer languages), are typical when amateurs (or college dropouts) try to create a new technology. Note that there are some examples of the opposite effect: such as an opera singer (Luciano Pavarotti) learning to sing well without being able to read music. However, in general, most attempts by hacks are botched failures. It is important to seek the knowledge of experts, but hacks might not even understand the basics that experts know, so some humility is needed in such discussions.
For years in HTML, a table has always forced an implicit line-wrap (or "line-break"), so to keep a table within a line, the work-around is to put the whole line into a table, then imbed a table-within-a-table, using the outer table to force the whole line to stay together. Consider the following examples:
Use style="font-size:60%" to shrink the text within the box. However, the small text could be replaced with small images (aligned inside the inner table). The outer table is for 1 line only, so to make a 2nd line appear even, the exact length of line 1 must be pre-determined, to match the length of other lines.
Sometimes columns of data need to be listed in a different order, such as different contents in the 2nd column. Yet, because a wikitable is coded in markup language, the columns cannot simply be dragged across the screen as with a column-oriented editor. Instead, the harsh reality is that the tedious hand-editing of each cell, within a row, is often required as the fastest solution, in the long run.
However, some text editors do allow a repetition-loop to be defined to locate and shift every 7th line or such, as a repeated pattern that could re-arrange the columns in a large table. In another method sometimes used, every data-item is first prefixed with an alphabetic code, hand-coded for the eventual sequence, then those lines are sorted, and afterward all the leading-text prefixes are removed. Sorting can be done in separate files, such as using a DOS-prompt command: SORT myfile.DAT > myfile2.DAT, or else use a text-editor such as Notetab, which has a modify-lines-sort option. Edit-tricks are most useful when multiple tables must be changed, then the time needed to develop complex edit-patterns can be applied to each table. For each table, insert an alpha-prefix on each column (making each row-token "|-" to sort as column zero, like prefix "Row124col00"), then sort into a new file, and then de-prefix the column entries.
Again, bear in mind, the tedious hand-editing of items, in each row, is often faster, than the potential of automated edits gone awry. If just 2 columns are being swapped, within 1 table, then cut/paste editing (of those column entries) is typically faster than column-prefixing, sorting & de-prefixing.

Wikipedia:Pruning article revisions

Although the Simple Wikipedia, today, has less than thousand articles (plus thousands of red-link articles), the total revisions number nearly million.
As of --, the article count was articles, with total revisions, giving an average
of revisions per article.
Pruning, or erasing (deleting) small revisions might need changing of Wikipedia policies or adjusting the underlying MediaWiki software. However, revisions could also be pruned "in advance", by many actions each person could take to avoid long-term storing of more revisions.
You might wonder if it even matters that Wikipedia has such a high number of revisions. But there are some issues. 
First, there is a heavy cost to the numerous revisions. The Wikimedia Foundation, which operates Wikipedia, is non-profit organization. Its continued operation relies solely on private donations. Without these donations, Wikipedia could not exist.
There is a cost to each edit, each revision stored, and each time a page is viewed even without editing. Though the cost of each one is minute, with millions each day, these all add up. People are not discouraged from reading or editing Wikipedia for this reason. That's what this is for, and funds have been allocated for this purpose, provided they are used responsibly.
The quality of writing is also at stake. The goal of Wikipedia is to have a well-written encyclopedia. This cannot be accomplished in one day, or in a single edit for each article. But an edit history that is clogged with experimental or "junk" edits may become confusing, and versions that fail to meet encyclopedic standards may in the long run have a negative effect, particularly if they are not marked with tags to indicate their temporary status.
An editor who makes multiple edits to an article in an attempt to achieve his/her final plan could be viewing any edits before the final one as temporary revisions that will not remain very long. Sometimes, it is not easy or even possible to get the permanently planned revision made in a single edit. This can be the case when the edit contains a large amount of text, or when it is difficult to write all the text at once.
Some of the actions that could be performed, by individual users, to prune both the current and future revisions would be:
Each of the above actions is elaborated below, to explain the particular ways of reducing revisions.
Many new users simply do not know they can combine their edits as one SAVE, using a longer edit-summary line. Users often just change a word & save, change a word & save, etc. Some users don't even realize how the extra revisions pile-up, expanding as a long list under the History tab of past edits. Several simple steps could be taught:
I've noticed several new users, while greatly expanding a low-traffic article, will keep saving every new phrase as though other users might pounce, at any minute, on the revised article before the next desperate SAVE is made. Many users don't understand how to watch the History listing to see if an article is quiet now, unchanged for weeks, and can be safely edited for hours with no one else making changes.
Some kinds of vandalism go unnoticed for months, sometimes over 6 months, so there is no hurry to revert all hackings made in low-traffic articles. There are several issues to consider:
The tendency to rapidly revert vandalism, as though the whole world has stopped breathing, has made it difficult for other users to also enhance those articles while correcting hacked text. It is an utter myth that "Every article gets vandalized" (not true): many articles go years without ever being hacked. Depending on notability or libel concerns, many hacked articles could wait (a long time) to be fixed while improving.
It would be a lot easier to warn new users, early on, that just because they SAVE, after every change, as a new revision, those changes are not safer or, somehow, more permanent. No, other users can simply revert all those revisions, reversing days/weeks of edits. The only permanent change is bloating Wikipedia ("forever") with numerous edits, all of which get reverted. Some issues to consider:
Not every group of other editors is cooperative; sometimes, cliques of other users can act like inner-wiki ("inner-city") gangs that live by their code, while outsiders receive pre-calculated treatment. There might be no safe way to save revisions, or get talk-page consensus, under those circumstances. Either move on to other articles, or else, contact an admin or WikiProject that might help the balance of power.
Plan some enhancements to articles by using offline files of either notes or potential new text. It might help to explain to users that creating an offline version of an article can allow more time for completing broad revisions, but then simply merge, into that new text, any other user changes that have been made meanwhile. Some issues to note:
For large updates, planning enhancements offline could reduce total revisions by a factor of 25 (or more), due to the focus on broad wording, while avoiding hacks to half-finished text by the tinkering of other users.
Beyond just planning enhancements, it can be easier to create entire articles offline. Some issues to note:
Note that offline storage does not have the Wikipedia backup protection, so be sure to make periodic copies, if needed, for backup.
Perhaps the easiest way to actually erase old revisions is to create a new article within the user-space for a particular user, then copy (not move) the article to become a brand-new entry in article-space. When the text is copied as a new article, then all those user-space revisions could be deleted. Some issues to note:
The article revisions will not be removed from Wikipedia until the user-space article has been deleted. After 2007, it became possible to restored a deleted article, so in the event of a major misunderstanding, any deleted article can be restored by an admin.
An effective way to actually erase many old revisions is to rename an old article, by creating the new name as a new article, then copy (not move) the article to become a brand-new entry in article-space. When the text is copied as a new article, then all those old revisions (under the old name) could be later deleted. Some issues to note:
Again, some people treasure the old stuff, like keeping decades of old, worn-out shoes, so not all articles can be pruned so easily by simply copy-renaming them into a clean, fresh name. The best compromise would be to keep an old history list in the talk-page or as a subpage "/old_history". However, in a fight to retain the detailed differences, it might be necessary to recreate the major old revisions by a series of repeated edits, filling the wiki-edit buffer with each successive major revision, and then saving each to allow comparisons of texts. Those recreated revisions should copy the edit-summary line from the actual old revisions, but also include text identifying each original user+date. Even though that re-creation, of major revisions, might seem extreme, many hundreds/thousands of minor revisions would be omitted, representing years of edits with just a few dozen recreated, "major" (non-trivial) revisions. Such a re-created article could retain the major detailed differences, showing how the article evolved, but omit the thousands of minor interim revisions that clutter a step-by-step viewing of each next revision.
Some of the , which perform repeated robotic edits to many articles, are focused on really tiny updates to articles, with some even correcting the grammar in vandalism humor or within hacked text that will soon be removed. For example, a bot that capitalizes the word "english" to be "English" assumes that people never use the word in any other manner, such as "putting english" (a spin) on a billiard ball. It is highly debatable to allow bots to run rampant, and make opinionated conclusions about lowercase words (such as "english"). Of course, thousands of revisions could be generated by renaming "metre" to "meter" or some similar minor changes. Bots should be denied from making those minor changes.
The fixer-bots should be run on a rare basis, and perhaps even count how many corrections would be made to an article, then cleverly refuse to update an article just for a single minor word, unless the bot was running in a "quarterly" update-all-minor-issues mode. Let the bots analyze small problems, or even count the occurrences of lowercase "english" and such, but those bots should wait to fix minor issues, limiting severe precision to a few times a year, and then fix all problems with one revision to each article, at that later time.
Although techniques such as deleting user-space articles and copy-renaming old articles might seem extreme, the combined effect of thousands of users, each redoing articles in their specialty, could reduce portions of Wikipedia by 10x, 100x or 1000x times fewer revisions. After that point, users taught to combine numerous small edits (in the future), and avoid panic saving, would reduce the subsequent revision lists and omit most of the small stuff that cluttered Wikipedia during 2006–2008.
The overall effect would be simple to measure: just compare how the average-revision count fell, compared with:
Progress could be measured by comparing those averages against a future, anticipated reduction in average revisions per article.
Many revisions of Wikipedia articles are very minor and could be "pruned" from the overall History of article revisions, to leave only the more major revisions. Even if the minor revisions were actually left in storage, perhaps they could be bypassed when listing all other article revisions. However, actually erasing specific revisions from an article might require changing, or reconfiguring, the software behind Wikipedia, the MediaWiki system.
Perhaps 50% of all revisions are hackings/jokes + revert: it's not just the hacking of articles that escalates the total revisions, but the instant reverting that doubles the total revisions to recover from hacking.
If the Wikipedia system for storing pages were changed, then over half of all revisions could be erased from Wikipedia servers and no longer listed under the "History" tab of logged revisions:
Again, erasing or combining old revisions might require changing, or adjusting, the MediaWiki software behind Wikipedia.
Long lists of revisions showing hackings, each followed by instant-reverts, can cause the History listing of revisions to become much longer. Beyond a survey of prankster edits, there's not much use for the long-term logging of a hacking+revert. It's analogous to bird droppings: it might be beneficial to notice some short-term patterns, such as when automobiles parked under some trees get bombarded with bird droppings, but it is less useful to record all the millions of bird droppings, everywhere in the world, in a giant database of history listings. Just forget about those bird droppings, rather than log each for eternity. Seek to have a "clean car", and focus on issues such as dents or tree branches falling on a automobile.
The process of erasing a revision should require some special authority to avoid edit-wars that would use erase to negate other contributions. The 3-revert rule () is intended to limit edit-wars during a one-day period. However, unrestricted use of erase could prolong edit-wars where revisions were removed without reverting.
Also, an erase could complicate the wikiserver databases, unless an erase was treated as a "delete" transaction in the storage. The database transaction log could handle the erase as a delete of that particular revision. Internally, the article history could record a hacking as a "Try" followed by an "Erase" so that the list of revisions would not show either transaction under the "History" tab when listing all the true revisions. However, long term, it might be more efficient if the hacking+erase really disappeared from the article storage at some point. Those combined "Try+Erase" transactions could be removed from the system after some period of time. Obviously, each transaction must be recorded, short-term, to allow backup/recovery of the edited articles, in the event of storage failure mid-way before the erase took effect.
If hackings cannot be erased, then perhaps they could be skipped in History listings. A special type of revert could indicate that the prior revision was merely hacked text, with the result that both the hacked+reverted entries would be skipped under a History listing. It can be very tedious, when stepping through multiple revisions, to see "Page blanked with" and then "Reverted" to show the entire text of the article changed in both revisions. Skipping over the hacked+reverted revisions would cut the History listing of many high-traffic articles by about 50% or more. However, many low-traffic articles have gone years without being hacked.

Copper(II) carbonate

Copper(II) carbonate, also known as cupric carbonate, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CuCO. It contains copper in its +2 oxidation state. It also contains carbonate ions.
Copper(II) carbonate is a blue-green solid. It is made when copper is in air for a long time and turns green. The other part of that coating is copper(II) hydroxide. It dissolves in acids to make carbon dioxide and a copper salt. It breaks down when heated to make carbon dioxide and copper(II) oxide.
It can be made by leaving copper(II) hydroxide in air, which makes copper(II) carbonate. It can also be made by reacting copper sulfate and sodium carbonate. This makes sodium sulfate in solution.
Copper(II) carbonate can be used to kill algae. It is also used as a pigment.
It can irritate the skin. It is toxic since it dissolves in stomach acid to make copper ions in solution, which can be absorbed.

Copper(II) hydroxide

Copper(II) hydroxide, also known as cupric hydroxide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Cu(OH). It contains copper in its +2 oxidation state. It also contains hydroxide ions.
Copper(II) hydroxide is light blue. It is rubbery when wet. When it is mixed with copper(II) carbonate, it is greenish. It reacts with carbon dioxide to make copper(II) carbonate when in air. It turns into copper(II) oxide when wet. When it is dry, though, it only turns into copper(II) oxide when it is heated. It reacts with ammonia to make a very dark blue solution.
Copper(II) hydroxide can be made by reacting copper sulfate with sodium hydroxide. Potassium hydroxide can be used, but it is more expensive. It can also be made by electrolyzing a solution of sodium bicarbonate with a copper anode. 
Copper(II) hydroxide is used to kill mold in paints. It can be used to color ceramics. It can be used as a catalyst. 
It is not toxic in small amounts, but it can dissolve in stomach acid to make soluble copper, which can poison much more easily.

Copper(II) oxide

Copper(II) oxide, also known as cupric oxide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CuO. It has copper in its +2 oxidation state. It also has oxide ions.
Copper(II) oxide is a black solid. It dissolves in acids to make copper(II) salts. It can react with carbon monoxide or hydrogen to make copper metal. It dissolves in very concentrated alkalis. It dissolves in ammonia to make a dark blue solution, similar to copper(II) hydroxide.
It can be made by heating copper(II) hydroxide. It can also be made by heating copper in air. It can also be made by heating copper(II) carbonate or copper(II) nitrate.
Copper(II) oxide is used to color ceramics. It is also used to make thermite. It can react with many toxic chemicals to oxidize them, so they are not toxic any more. It can be added to vitamins to get copper into the body. It can also be added to clothing to kill germs.
Copper(II) oxide is toxic when eaten. It can be eaten in very small amounts, such as in vitamins. This adds copper to the body, which is needed.

Copper(II) sulfate

Copper(II) sulfate, also known as cupric sulfate, copper sulfate, blue vitriol, or bluestone, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CuSO. It contains copper in its +2 oxidation state. It also contains sulfate ions. It is a blue solid that can kill fungi. It is also used to purify copper metal. It is common in chemistry sets and chemistry demonstrations.
Copper(II) sulfate is a blue solid when hydrated (attached to water molecules). It is whitish when anhydrous (not attached to water molecules). When hydrated, it normally has five water molecules attached to it. It can be dehydrated by heating it. When water is added to it, it gets hydrated again. When it is in air, it absorbs water vapor and becomes hydrated, too.
It is a weak oxidizing agent. It reacts with most metals to make copper and a metal sulfate. For example, it reacts with iron to make copper and iron(II) sulfate. 
It reacts with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide to make copper(II) hydroxide. 
It reacts with sodium carbonate to make copper(II) carbonate.
It reacts with ammonia to make a dark blue solution. This solution can dissolve fibers in cotton. 
When it is heated to a high temperature, it turns into copper(II) oxide and sulfur trioxide.
It makes a blue-green color when it is heated in a flame, like all copper compounds.
Copper(II) sulfate is found in the ground as chalcanthite. Chalcanthite is easily dissolved. It is only found in dry areas. When it is in air, it loses its bright blue color. Some minerals are tested by taste. Chalcanthite has a sweet metal taste. It should only be tasted carefully, as it is poisonous. Its Mohs hardness is 2.5. It is the pentahydrate of copper sulfate. It is blue or green. Many people collecting minerals want it.
Copper sulfate is not normally made in a small laboratory, because it is much easier just to buy it. There are some ways to make copper sulfate, however.
Copper(II) sulfate can be made by electrolysis of a solution of sulfuric acid with copper electrodes. Hydrogen is made, as well as copper sulfate solution. 
It can also be made by reacting copper(II) oxide or copper(II) hydroxide or copper(II) carbonate with sulfuric acid or by adding copper to heated concentrated sulphuric acid: 
It can also be made by reacting copper with a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid.
Copper(II) sulfate, as the most common copper compound, has many uses. It can be used to kill algae and fungi. Some fungi can get resistant to copper sulfate, though. Then the copper sulfate does not kill them any more. It can be mixed with lime to make a similar fungi killer. It can be used to treat aquarium fish for infections. It is also used to detect sugars. It turns into red copper(I) oxide when reduced by a sugar. It can be used in organic chemistry as a catalyst and oxidizing agent. It is used to see whether blood is anemic.
It is commonly found in chemistry sets. It is used to demonstrate a displacement reaction, where a metal reacts with copper sulfate to make copper and the metal sulfate. It is also used to demonstrated hydrated and anhydrous chemicals. It was used as an emetic in the past. It is seen as too toxic now. 
It can be used to purify copper. A thin pure piece of copper and a thick impure piece of copper are placed in copper sulfate solution. The thin plate is connected to the negative wire and the thick plate to the positive wire. An electrical current is passed through them. The copper in the thick plate dissolves and plates on the thin plate. All of the impurities fall to the bottom, while the pure copper is made at the negative electrode.
Someone covered the walls of their apartment with copper sulfate crystals for decoration.
Copper sulfate is somewhat toxic to humans. It is very toxic to fish, though. In humans, it irritates skin and eyes. It can cause nausea when eaten. It automatically makes one throw up when it is ingested. If too much is eaten, however, it can get into the stomach and cause many problems.

Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Company

Cooper Tire & Rubber Company () is a United States based company. They design, manufacture, marketing and sales replacement automobile and truck tires. With their subsidiaries they produce medium truck, motorcycle and racing tires. Their headquarters is in Findlay, Ohio. Cooper Tire has 60 facilities located around the world.
Cooper also owns the UK Avon Tyres brand, which also produces tires for motorcycles, road cars, and for motor racing.
The beginning for Cooper Tire was the "M and M Company". M and M was formed by two brothers-in-law in Akron, Ohio in 1914. M and M made tire repair materials. M and M was bought by the Giant Tire and Rubber Company and moved to Findlay, Ohio. The site is still occupied by Cooper Tire and is next to The Cooper Corporation facilities. The Cooper name came from Ira J. Cooper in 1919. He formed a company to manufacture new tires. The Cooper Corporation, the M and M Company, and The Falls Rubber company merged in 1930 to form the "Master Tire and Rubber Company".
During World War II the Master Tire and Rubber built military equipment, such as pontoons, waterproof bags, life jackets, and, tires. The company received the Army-Navy 'E' Award for excellence. The name was changed to Cooper Tire and Rubber Company in 1946.
Cooper Tire began a 51% owned joined venture with Shandong Chengshan Tire Co in 2006. They will produce truck and passenger car tires for Chinese and export markets. Cooper Tires is the second largest United States based tire company, after Goodyear.
Cooper Tires produces Cooper branded tires for passenger cars, light trucks, sport utility vehicles and commercial trucks.
In 1997, the tyre business of Avon Rubber PLC of Melksham, Wiltshire, in the United Kingdom was sold to Cooper Tire. The Cooper Tire site remains a major employer in central Melksham.
In addition to Avon, Cooper Tire manufactures tires under the brand names Dean, Mastercraft and Starfire.
Cooper Tire became the official tire of the A1 Grand Prix for the series' initial 2005-06 season. Cooper was under contract to produce tires for the series championship until 2007-08. Cooper Tire became the official tire of the Champ Car Atlantic Championship in 2007. Cooper Tire became the official tire of USF2000 National Championship and the IMSA Prototype Lites series (formerly IMSA Lites) in 2010. 
Cooper is heavily involved in the sport of drifting by supplying tires to several drifters in both the Need for Speed Formula D Drift series and Canadian Drift series.
Cooper employs 13,311 employees. Roy V. Armes is Chairman, President, and CEO.

Copper(I) chloride, also known as cuprous chloride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CuCl. It contains copper in its +1 oxidation state. It also contains chloride ions. 
Copper(I) chloride is white when pure. It does not dissolve in water. It is green when in air because of conversion to copper(II) chloride. It can react with Lewis bases, a group of chemicals. It dissolves in hydrochloric acid easily. It dissolves in solutions that have ammonia in them. It absorbs carbon monoxide. It easily disproportionates into copper and copper(II) chloride. It reacts with ammonia and acetylene to make copper(I) acetylide, a reddish explosive.
It can be made by reduction of copper(II) chloride. It was made at first by reacting copper with mercury(II) chloride. It can be made by heating copper(II) chloride very hot. Some chlorine is released, and copper(I) chloride is left behind.
Copper(I) chloride is used to make a fungicide, which is used to kill fungi. It is also used to make many organic compounds.

Copper(II) chloride is light brown when anhydrous. It is green when hydrated. It is a weak oxidizing agent. It reacts with aluminium foil to make hydrogen, copper(I) oxide, and aluminium chloride. This is used in school demonstrations. It releases chlorine and turns into copper(I) chloride when heated very hot. It reacts with sodium hydroxide to make copper(II) hydroxide. Copper(II) chloride reacts with metals to make metal chlorides and copper. It puts out blue flames if it is heated in a flame. It reacts with sulfur dioxide to make copper(I) chloride. It dissolves in water to make a blue solution. When more chloride is added, it turns green, then yellow.
It is made by reacting copper with chlorine. It can also be made by reacting copper(II) hydroxide, copper(II) oxide, or copper(II) carbonate with hydrochloric acid and from pure copper and from 1:1 solution of hydrogen peroxide and hydrochloric acid where copper first get oxidized to CuO from H2O2 and then reacts with HCl to form CuCl2, reaction goes like this:
Cu + HO → CuO + HO
CuO + 2HCl → CuCl + HO
Copper(II) chloride is used to make fungicides. It is also used to make organic compounds. It is also used to make acetaldehyde from ethane.
It is toxic, with toxicity similar to copper sulfate It is therefore harmful.

Copper(I) oxide

Copper(I) oxide, also known as cuprous oxide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CuO. It contains copper in its +1 oxidation state. It also contains oxide ions.
Copper(I) oxide is a red solid. It can also be yellow, but not commonly. It does not dissolve in water. It turns into copper(II) oxide when in air. It dissolves in ammonia to make a colorless complex. This is oxidized to a blue complex of copper(II). It dissolves in concentrated hydrochloric acid. It also dissolves in concentrated sulfuric acid to make copper(II) sulfate and nitric acid to make copper(II) nitrate.
Copper(I) oxide is found in the ground. It is a copper ore.
Copper(I) oxide is made by heating copper in air. Some copper(II) oxide is also made. It can also be made by reducing copper(II) oxide or other copper(II) compounds. It is the result of a test for sugars. Green copper(II) chloride is reduced to red copper(I) oxide when a sugar is present.
Copper(I) oxide is used as a semiconductor. It is also used as a pigment and fungicide. It can be used to stop things from growing on ships.

Copper(I) acetylide

Copper(I) acetylide, also known as cuprous acetylide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CuC. It contains copper in its +1 oxidation state. It also contains acetylide ions.
Copper(I) acetylide is a reddish solid. It is an explosive. It is a strange explosive because it does not release gas. When it detonates, it only releases copper and carbon. It can be formed inside copper pipes where acetylene flows through. It explodes because the acetylide is a reducing agent and the copper(I) is an oxidizing agent. 
It is made by reacting copper(I) chloride dissolved in ammonia with acetylene. Hydrochloric acid and copper(I) acetylide is made. This reaction is used to test for acetylene.
It is used in organic chemistry. It is a very sensitive explosive, too sensitive to be used.

Bridgestone

The very first Bridgestone tire was produced on April 9, 1930, by the Japanese "Tabi" Socks Tyre Division. On March 1, 1931, the founder, Shojiro Ishibashi, made the "Tabi" Socks tire Division independent and established the Bridgestone Tire Co., Ltd. in the city of Kurume, Fukuoka Prefecture. "Bridgestone" was named after the name of the founder, Shojiro Ishibashi ("Ishi" = Stone, "Bashi" = Bridge).
The Bridgestone tire Co., Ltd. decided to build tires based solely on Japanese technology. The company had many problems in the early days. Improvements were made in quality and the building processes. The business expanded rapidly on both the domestic and overseas markets.
Wartime regulations sent nearly all of the company's output to the military. After the war, the company was devastated. The Tokyo Headquarters building was destroyed by aerial bombing. All of their overseas assets were lost. The factories in Kurume and Yokohama were not damaged. Production was restarted after the war ended. 
After World War II, Bridgestone started manufacturing motorcycles. But its main income was from supplying tires to its rival motorcycle makers such as Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha. Bridgestone later decided to stop building motorcycles.
In 1951, Bridgestone was the first company in Japan to begin selling rayon cord tires. The sale of nylon tires was started in 1959. 1967 saw the sale of first ever radial tire. Bridgestone's first overseas plant since the end of the war was opened in Singapore in 1965. Bridgestone America was started in the United States in 1967 to represent Bridgestone. The "Super Filler Radial" went on the market in 1978. In 1979 the company introduced the high-performance "POTENZA" radial tire. 
The company name changed to Bridgestone Corporation in 1984.
In 1988, Bridgestone purchased the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. Bridgestone invested a lot of money into Firestone. They worked on rebuilding the Firestone company. By 1992, they were making a profit with "Bridgestone Firestone Europe". By 1993, they were making a profit with "Bridgestone Firestone USA". 
The Firestone Tire and Rubber Company and Bridgestone Tire Company Ltd USA were merged in 1990 and became Bridgestone Firestone North American Holdings Ltd. To increase the brand awareness, they re-entered the Firestone brand into IndyCar racing in 1995. In 1997, "Bridgestone Corporation Japan" entered the Bridgestone brand into Formula One racing.
Bridgestone has supplied tires in Formula One since . They supplied tires on a one race only basis for the and Japanese Grands Prix. These tires were for Japanese teams such as Heros Racing and Kojima.
Bridgestone decided to supply tires for Formula One in 1995. They wanted to improve company's name value in the European market. Their main competitor was Michelin. 
Their first title was acquired in by Mika Häkkinen and McLaren-Mercedes. Bridgestone users took five Drivers' championship titles and five Constructors' championship titles during the years that had more than one tire available. For (–), they competed with Goodyear. For (–), they competed with Michelin.
Michelin chose to end its Formula One tire program after the season. All teams have used Bridgestone tires from the season to the season. On November 2, 2009 Bridgestone announced that they will end their contract to supply tires to Formula One teams after 2010. The company said it was "addressing the impact of the continuing evolution of the business environment" 
Bridgestone makes many other products than tires. The list includes: automotive components, industrial products, polyurethane foam products, construction materials, parts and materials for electronic equipment, bicycles and sporting goods.
On December 5, 2006, Bridgestone America and Bandag Inc. announced a merger. Bandag was a leading company in the tire re-treading business. Tire re-treading is the process of putting a new tread on a used tire. This will extend the life of the tire and save money. This process is mostly done on large truck tires. The name of new company has become "Bridgestone Bandag, LLC".
The Bridgestone Cycle Co Ltd started in 1949. It offers bicycles under its own brand and under the "Anchor brand".
"Bridgestone Aircraft tire (USA)" builds aircraft tires and provides re-tread services. 
"Precept Golf" is a division of Bridgestone. They sell the Bridgestone Golfing Products. Bridgestone has been producing golf-related products since 1935. The Golf division of Bridgestone currently produces both clubs, balls and accessories.

Abstraction

Abstraction is a process of removing or hiding details about something. It concerns the ways by which higher, less "real" concepts are derived from the usage and classification of literal ("real" or "concrete") data or other information.
Abstractions may be formed by reducing the information content of a concept or a phenomenon as viewed, often to keep only the information which is needed for a particular purpose. For example, abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a ball will keep only the information on general ball attributes and behavior, omitting the traits of that particular ball. Compare with word: "generalizing". The opposite of the adjective "abstract" is commonly the word "concrete".
The first symbols of abstract thinking in humans can be traced to fossil objects dating between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago in Africa.
In philosophical terminology, "abstraction" is the thought process wherein ideas are distanced from objects.
Abstraction uses a strategy of simplification, where formerly concrete details are left ambiguous, vague, or undefined; thus effective communication about things in the abstract requires an intuitive or common experience between the communicator and the communication recipient.
For example, many different things can be the color red. Likewise, many things sit on surfaces (as in "picture 1", to the right). The property of "redness" and the relation "sitting-on" are therefore abstractions of those objects. Specifically, the conceptual diagram "graph 1" identifies only three boxes, two ellipses, and four arrows (and their six labels), whereas the "picture 1" shows much more pictorial detail, with the scores of implied relationships as implicit in the picture rather than with the nine explicit details in the graph.
"Graph 1" details some explicit relationships between the objects of the diagram. For example, the arrow between the "agent" and "CAT:Elsie" depicts an example of an "is-a" relationship, as does the arrow between the "location" and the "MAT". The arrows between the gerund "SITTING" and the nouns "agent" and "location" express the diagram's basic relationship; "agent is SITTING on location"; "Elsie" is an instance of "CAT".
Although the description "sitting-on" (graph 1) is more abstract than the graphic image of a cat sitting on a mat (picture 1), the delineation of abstract things from concrete things is somewhat ambiguous; this ambiguity or vagueness is characteristic of abstraction. Thus something as simple as a newspaper might be specified to six levels, as in Douglas Hofstadter's illustration of that ambiguity, with a progression from abstract to concrete in "Gödel, Escher, Bach" (1979):
An abstraction can thus encapsulate each of these levels of detail with no loss of generality. But perhaps a detective or philosopher/scientist/engineer might seek to learn about some thing, at progressively deeper levels of detail, to solve a crime or a puzzle.
Abstractions sometimes have ambiguous referents; for example, "happiness" (when used as an abstraction) can refer to as many things as there are people and events or states of being which make them happy. Likewise, "architecture" refers not only to the design of safe, functional buildings, but also to elements of creation and innovation which aim at elegant solutions to construction problems, to the use of space, and to the attempt to evoke an emotional response in the builders, owners, viewers and users of the building.
Things that do not exist at any particular place and time are often considered abstract. By contrast, instances, or members, of such an abstract thing might exist in many different places and times. Those abstract things are then said to be "multiply instantiated", in the sense of "picture 1", "picture 2", etc., shown above.
It is not sufficient, however, to define "abstract" ideas as those that can be instantiated and to define "abstraction" as the movement in the opposite direction to instantiation. Doing so would make the concepts "cat" and "telephone" abstract ideas since despite their varying appearances, a particular cat or a particular telephone is an instance of the concept "cat" or the concept "telephone". Although the concepts "cat" and "telephone" are "abstractions", they are not "abstract" in the sense of the objects in "graph 1" above.
We might look at other graphs, in a progression from "cat" to "mammal" to "animal", and see that "animal" is more abstract than "mammal"; but on the other hand "mammal" is a harder idea to express, certainly in relation to "marsupial" or "monotreme".
A physical object (a possible referent of a concept or word) is considered "concrete" (not abstract) if it is a "particular individual" that occupies a particular place and time.
Abstract things are sometimes defined as those things that do not exist in reality or exist only as sensory experiences, like the color red. That definition, however, suffers from the difficulty of deciding which things are real (i.e. which things exist in reality). For example, it is difficult to agree to whether concepts like "God", "the number three", and "goodness" are real, abstract, or both.
An approach to resolving such difficulty is to use "predicates" as a general term for whether things are variously real, abstract, concrete, or of a particular property (e.g. "good"). Questions about the properties of things are then propositions about predicates, which propositions remain to be evaluated by the investigator. In the "graph 1" above, the graphical relationships like the arrows joining boxes and ellipses might denote predicates. Different levels of abstraction might be denoted by a progression of arrows joining boxes or ellipses in multiple rows, where the arrows point from one row to another, in a series of other graphs, say graph 2, etc.
Abstraction in philosophy is the process (or, to some, the alleged process) in concept-formation of recognizing some set of common features in individuals, and on that basis forming a concept of that feature. The notion of abstraction is important to understanding some philosophical controversies surrounding empiricism and the problem of universals. It has also recently become popular in formal logic under predicate abstraction. Another philosophical tool for discussion of abstraction is thought space.
The way in which physical objects, like rocks and trees, have "being" differs from the way that properties of abstract concepts or relations have "being". For example, the way the concrete, particular, individuals pictured in "picture 1" exist differs from the way the concepts illustrated in "graph 1" exist. That difference accounts for the ontological usefulness of the word "abstract". The word applies to properties and relations to mark the fact that, if they exist, they do not exist in space or time, but that instances of them can exist, potentially in many different places and times.
Perhaps confusingly, some philosophies refer to "tropes" (instances of properties) as "abstract particulars". E.g., the particular redness of a particular apple is an "abstract particular". Akin to qualia and sumbebekos.
If an abstract concept, such as "society" or "technology" is treated as if it were a concrete object, that is a fallacy (an error). In linguistics, it may happen that abstract concepts are used as if they were nouns that signify concrete objects:
This is called "metonymy". It can blur the distinction between abstract and concrete things.
An abstraction can be seen as a process of mapping multiple different pieces of constituent data to a single piece of abstract data based on similarities in the constituent data, for example many different physical cats map to the abstraction "CAT". This conceptual scheme emphasizes the inherent equality of both constituent and abstract data, thus avoiding problems arising from the distinction between "abstract" and "concrete". In this sense the process of abstraction entails the identification of similarities between objects and the process of associating these objects with an abstraction (which is itself an object).
Chains of abstractions can therefore be constructed moving from neural impulses arising from sensory perception to basic abstractions such as color or shape to experiential abstractions such as a specific cat to semantic abstractions such as the "idea" of a CAT to classes of objects such as "mammals" and even categories such as "object" as opposed to "action".
This conceptual scheme entails no specific hierarchical taxonomy (such as the one mentioned involving cats and mammals), only a progressive exclusion of detail.
A recent meta-analysis suggests that the verbal system has greater engagement for abstract concepts when the perceptual system is more engaged for processing of concrete concepts. This is because abstract concepts cause greater brain activity in the inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus, compared to concrete concepts when concrete concepts cause greater activity in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus.
Other research into the human brain suggests that the left and right hemispheres, of the brain, differ in their handling of abstraction. For example, one meta-analysis reviewing human brain lesions has shown a left hemisphere bias during tool usage.
Typically, "abstraction" is used in the arts as a synonym for abstract art in general. Strictly speaking, it refers to art unconcerned with the literal depiction of things from the visible world—it can, however, refer to an object or image which has been distilled from the real world, or indeed, another work of art. Artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract; that which derives from, but does not imitate a recognizable subject is called nonobjective abstraction. In the 20th century the trend toward abstraction coincided with advances in science, technology, and changes in urban life, eventually reflecting an interest in psychoanalytic theory. Later still, abstraction was manifest in more purely formal terms, such as color, freed from objective context, and a reduction of form to basic geometric designs.
In music, the term "abstraction" can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation, and may sometimes indicate abandonment of tonality. Atonal music has no key signature, and is characterized the exploration of internal numeric relationships.
Carl Jung's definition of abstraction broadened its scope beyond the thinking process to include exactly four mutually exclusive, opposing complementary psychological functions: sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking. Together they form a structural totality of the differentiating abstraction process. Abstraction operates in one of these opposing functions when it excludes the simultaneous influence of the other functions and other irrelevancies, such as emotion. Abstraction requires selective use of this structural split of abilities in the psyche. The opposite of abstraction is concretism. "Abstraction" is one of Jung's 57 definitions in Chapter XI of "Psychological Types".
There is an abstract "thinking", just as there is abstract "feeling", "sensation" and "intuition". Abstract thinking singles out the rational, logical qualities ... Abstract feeling does the same with ... its feeling-values. ... I put abstract feelings on the same level as abstract thoughts. ... Abstract sensation would be aesthetic as opposed to sensuous "sensation" and abstract intuition would be symbolic as opposed to fantastic "intuition". (Jung, [1921] (1971):par. 678).
Computer scientists use abstraction to understand and solve problems, such as organizing data to be stored in a database.
Abstraction in mathematics is the process of extracting the underlying essence of a mathematical concept, removing any dependence on real-world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena.
The advantages of abstraction in mathematics are:
The main disadvantage of abstraction is that highly abstract concepts are more difficult to learn, and require a degree of mathematical maturity and experience before they can be assimilated.

Eye makeup

Eye makeup is a type of cosmetics which aims to make the eyes look noticeable and attractive. It is mostly used by females, and by stage performers of all types. Eye makeup is an important part of the fashion and cosmetic industries. The main types of eye makeup are:
The idea can be taken much further. The colour of the eye can be altered by using contact lenses. Glitter and other "appliqués" can be stuck on near the eye. Fake eyelashes or eyelash extensions are possible. Eyebrow plucking is quite common for brunettes.
Mascara is a cosmetic used to darken, colour, thicken, lengthen, or define eyelashes. Historically, it was (and still is) usually black, but now it also comes in many colours and tints. Mascara comes in three forms: liquid, cake, and cream. It is available in tubes with wand applicators. Ingredients in mascara include water, wax thickeners, film-formers, and preservatives. 
Eye shadow is a cosmetic that is applied on the eyelids and under the eyebrows. The average distance between eyelashes and eyebrows is twice as big in women as in men. Pale eye shadow visually enlarges this area and has a feminising effect.
Eye shadow can be applied in a variety of ways depending upon the desired look. Typically application is done using sponges, fingers, and/or brushes. The most important aspect of applying eye shadow, and makeup in general, is blending well.
To remove eye shadow, a commercial eye makeup remover may be used, though a face wash will usually remove all traces of colour. Generally it is easy to remove, and simple water and soap can be used. Eye shadow, eyeliner, and mascara may also be removed using baby oil or olive oil. There are also makeup wipes that may be used.
Eye liner is a cosmetic used to define the eyes. It is applied around the contours of the eye, along and above the edges of the eyelids where the eyelashes grow. Often applied just on the outer half of the eye.
Depending on its texture, eyeliner can be softly smudged or clearly defined. There are four main types available on the market: 
Kohl is an ancient black eye pigment which survives to the present day in the Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. It was a dark-colored powder made of crushed galena (lead sulfide) and/or antimony, burnt almonds, lead, cupric oxide, ochre, ash, malachite, or any combination of them. It may be used as an eye liner, mascara or eyeshadow.
The upper and lower eyelids were painted in a line that extended to the sides of the face for an almond effect. In addition to reducing sun glare, it was believed that kohl eyeliner could restore good eyesight and reduce eye infection. Kohl was kept in a small, flat-bottomed pot with a wide, tiny rim and a flat, disk-shaped lid.
According to images of the time, the use of makeup was not limited to women. Highly polished silver and copper mirrors aided the application of makeup.

Indy Racing League

The Indy Racing League (IRL) is an American-based open-wheel auto racing sanctioning body. The League sanctions three racing series. The premier IZOD IndyCar Series (ICS), the two developmental series; Firestone Indy Lights and the U.S. F2000 National Championship. ICS is sometimes considered the same as the Indy Racing League. The Indy Racing League's centerpiece race is the Indianapolis 500.
The IRL is owned by Hulman and Co., which also owns the Indianapolis Motor Speedway complex and the Clabber Girl brand.
On September 10, 2010, the IRL announced that effective January 1, 2011, the Indy Racing League will simply be known as "IndyCar".
The "IndyCar Series" is the series name for the premier series sanctioned by the IRL. The name started being used in 2003. Izod was announced as the IndyCar Series title sponsor in 2010. The deal is expected to run for at least five years.
At first IndyCar only raced on oval tracks. In 2005, the series started adding road and street course events. 
"Firestone Indy Lights" is the development series for the Izod Indycar series. It started in 2002, as the "IRL Infiniti Pro Series". "USF2000" is a series the IRL started sanctioning in 2010. It started in 1991 and ended in 2006. It then restarted in 2010.
"Indy car" is sometimes used as a name for any open-wheel auto racing in the United States. The Indy car name derived as a result of the link to the Indianapolis 500 Mile Race (often called to as the "Indy 500"). 
Beginning in 1980, the term Indy car was used for the race cars in CART races. CART had become the main governing body for open-wheel racing in the United States. The Indianapolis 500 was not controlled by CART. It remained sanctioned by USAC. CART recognized the Indy 500 on its schedule, and awarded points for finishers in the race from 1980–1995 despite not sanctioning it. The two entities operated separately, but used the same equipment.
In 1992, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway tradmarked the "IndyCar". They licensed CART to use the name. CART renamed its championship the "IndyCar World Series". The name "CART" was no longer used. The series did not want fans to think they were go-karts.
The IRL was founded in 1994 by Tony George and began racing in 1996. George designed the IRL as a lower-cost open-wheel alternative to CART. CART was dominated by a few rich multi-car teams, much like Formula One. The split between IRL and CART was very unfriendly. Both series greatly suffered because of it. 
In February 2008, Indy Racing League founder and CEO Tony George and owners of the Champ Car World Series completed an agreement to join together the sport for 2008. The Champ Car World Series was suspended except for the Long Beach Grand Prix. Many of the former Champ Car teams moved to the IndyCar Series using equipment provided by the League.
Driver safety has also been a major concern. A number of drivers injured, mostly in the early years of the series. Several of those injuries were serious or fatal. Unlike road racing, the higher speed and lack of runoff areas on oval tracks, allowed for less margin for error. Car design was a leading cause of early injuries.The series made improvements to chassis design to address those safety concerns. 
The IRL was also the first race series to adopt the new SAFER barrier soft wall safety system. First at the Indianapolis 500 and now installed at almost all major oval racing circuits.

Open wheel car

Open-wheel car describes cars with the wheels outside the car's main body and, in most cases, one seat. Other names include formula car, single-seater car in British English, or Indy car in the United States. Open-wheel cars are different from street cars, sports cars, stock cars, and touring cars. These car have their wheels below or inside the body or fenders. Open-wheel cars are usually built just for racing. Often, they have a higher amount of technological sophistication than in other forms of motor racing.
A typical open-wheeler has a small cockpit. It is only large enough for the driver's body. The head is exposed to the air. In modern cars the engine is often located directly behind the driver, and drives the rear wheels. Depending on the rules of the class, many types of open-wheelers have spoilers or wings. They are very low and have an almost flat bottom. These help add aerodynamic downforce. This pushes the car on to the road and makes it handle better.
Some races, such as the Monaco Grand Prix are held on temporary street circuits. Most open-wheel races are on dedicated road courses, such as the Nürburgring in Germany. In the United States some top-level open wheel events are held on ovals, both short track and superspeedways. The most famous the annual Indianapolis 500 (Indy 500) 
Driving an open-wheel car is very different from driving a car with fenders. Open-wheel vehicles, are light weight, have good aerodynamics, and powerful engines. Wheel-to-wheel contact is dangerous. If the forward edge of one tire contacts the rear of another tire, the vehicle my be flipped into the air and upside down.

Speech and language therapist

A Speech and Language Therapist is a health care professional who specialises in communication and swallowing difficulties. The main part of their work involves assessing people and planning therapy. They work with people of all ages across different settings such as nurseries, schools, day centres, care homes, clinics and hospitals.
These can include difficulties with fluency (stuttering), making sounds and words, making sentences,
understanding what others say, and using language socially. These difficulties fall into two main areas:
There are two types of language difficulties:
People with receptive language difficulties have problems understanding spoken and written language. Because of this they usually also have expressive language difficulties although this is not always the case.
People with expressive language difficulties are able to understand but cannot say the words and sentences they want to. This may be because of word finding difficulties or problems making sentences.
In children language difficulties are divided up into 
Where language difficulties occur with no other difficulties the child may be diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment.
In adults acquired receptive and expressive language impairments are known as aphasia. There are many different types of aphasia depending on which areas of the brain are damaged and what symptoms they show.
Speech therapists can help people with swallowing difficulties (dysphagia). They help patients through changing their diets to different textures and consistencies, or they may recommend non-oral feeding.

Semi-automatic shotgun

A semi-automatic shotgun is a kind of gun. It fires one shotgun shell every time the trigger is pulled. Most shotguns, such as pump-action shotguns, lever action shotguns, and break barrel shotguns, use no energy from the last fired shell to load the next one. A person using a semi-automatic shotgun has to load the first shell themselves. The rest of the shells are loaded by the gun using part of the energy used to fire each shell. 
Some shotguns can be semi-automatic, pump-action, or fully automatic. The SPAS-12, for example, can fire in semi-automatic mode or it can use a pump action. Pump action allows less deadly projectiles such as bean bags or gas canisters to be used. Some shotguns, such as the AA-12, can be fully automatic or it can be switched to semi-automatic mode.
Semi-automatic shotguns are commonly used by special forces, military, and for other uses where shells need to be fired quickly, without reloading.

The series continues to be sanctioned by the Indy Racing League, which has taken the name IndyCar. 
The IRL was unable to utilize the name "IndyCar" until the beginning of the 2003 for legal reasons. For 1996-1997, the series was simply called the "USAC Indy Racing League". For 1998-1999, the series received its first title sponsor, and was known as the "Pep Boys Indy Racing League". In 2000, the series sponsor became the Internet search engine Northern Light. The series was named the "Indy Racing Northern Light Series". This only lasted two of the planed five year contract.
The league went back to the "Indy Racing League" name for the 2002 season. The IndyCar Series name was adopted in 2003. For the 2008 season, DirecTV served as a presenting sponsor, and the series was briefly advertised as the "IndyCar Series in DIRECTV HD".
IZOD was announced as the series title sponsor beginning on November 5, 2009. The contrace runs for at least 5 years. In 2014, Verizon replaced IZOD as the series sponsor.
The IndyCar Series is not an open formula, where teams build their own cars. Chassis and engine manufacturers provided products only to the league in three-year cycles. Currently, Dallara provides the chassis to all teams and Honda is the sole engine supplier. The series basically a one-make or "spec" series.
In the series' first season in 1996 used older CART chassis. Any chassis built by Lola and Reynard from 1992 to 1995 could be used. The current Indycar started in 1997. Tony George defined rules for less expensive cars and production-based engines. This outlawed the CART chassis and turbocharged engines. These had been the type of race car used at the Indianapolis 500 since the late 1960s. 
Dallara began producing Indycars for the 1997 season. The G Force chassis was introduced in 1997. It won the 1997 and 2000 Indy 500 races. In 2002, Élan Motorsport Technologies bought G Force. The chassis was re-named "Panoz G Force", and then shortened to "Panoz" in 2005.
Riley & Scott produced IndyCar chassis from 1997-2000.
From the outside, IndyCars resemble those of other open-wheeled formula racing cars. They have front and rear wings and large air intakes.
At its inception, the IRL used methanol racing fuel. Methanol has been the standard choice in American open wheel racing since a fiery crash at the 1964 Indianapolis 500. Methanol provided a safer alternative to gasoline. It does not start burning as quickly as gasoline. A methanol fire can be put out with water. A methanol fire cannot be seen in daylight, which is a problem. Material was added to the fuel so it would burn with a color.
For the 2006 season, the fuel was a 90%/10% mixture of methanol and ethanol. Starting in 2007, the league advertised using 100% Fuel Grade Ethanol. The mixture was actually 98% ethanol and 2% gasoline. The additives satisfied the U.S. government's requirement that the alcohol be unfit for human consumption. It also adds a visible color in case of a fire.
For the 1996 season, the old CART specification engines were used. They were also used for the first two races of the 1996-97 season. They were V8 engines with 45 inches of turbocharger boost. The Menard-Buick V6 engine was used in 1996 with 55 inches of boost was also used.
Ford-Cosworth provided support to teams running their older-spec engines. The Ilmor Mercedes V8 engine, was allowed. It was only used once at the 1996 Indy 500.
Starting in 1997, IRL cars were powered by 4.0 L V8, methanol burning engines. They were production-based and normally-aspirated engines. They were produced by Oldsmobile under the Aurora label, and Nissan under the Infiniti label. They produced around 700 horsepower. The engine rules changed in 2000. The displacement was dropped from 4.0L to 3.5L. The block no longer needed to be production-based. In 2004, the displacement was further reduced to 3.0L to curb top speeds.
When General Motors' ended the Oldsmobile name, the engine label was changed to Chevrolet starting with the 2002 season. In August 2003, Chevrolet announced its "Gen IV" motor, a rebadged Cosworth motor for competition. At the time, Cosworth was owned by Ford. On November 4, 2004, Chevrolet stated that it would be ending its IRL engine program at the end of the 2005 season.
In 2003, Toyota came to the IRL. In November 2005, Toyota company officials announced the company's withdrawal from American open-wheel racing and the immediate discontinuation of its IRL program. This was the same time they entered into NASCAR's Craftsman Truck Series.
Honda also came to the IRL in 2003. By 2005 was clearly the dominant engine manufacturer. Starting in 2006, they became the only engine manufacturer in the IndyCar Series, and will continue in that capacity until 2010. The Honda engine is designed and produced by Ilmor Engineering, which is part owned by Roger Penske.
IndyCar Series engines are rev-limited to 10,300 Revolutions per minute (rpm) and produce approximately 650 hp. The valve train is a dual overhead camshaft configuration with four valves per cylinder. The crankshaft is made of alloy steel, with five main bearing caps. The pistons are forged aluminum alloy, while the connecting rods are machined alloy steel. The electronic engine management system is supplied by Motorola, firing a Capacitor discharge ignition (CDI) ignition system. The engine lubrication is a dry sump type, cooled by a single water pump.
Following the merger of CART/Champ Car into the Indy Racing League in 2008, the IRL acquired all intellectual property and historic records.
1996: Scott Sharp and Buzz Calkins were tied in the final standings, and were declared co-champions. Calkins had one win, as opposed to Sharp being winless, but no tiebreakers were in place.
2006: Sam Hornish, Jr. and Dan Wheldon tied in the final standings for first place. Hornish clinched the championship based on a tiebreaker of most victories during the season.
2008: Although no report was officially released about it in 2008, IndyCar.com confirmed in 2009 that Danica Patrick being named Most Popular Driver was her "fifth consecutive" win of the award.

Space opera

Some people have a negative opinion of Space Opera. They use the name as an insult. They do not like these stories because they have several problems. The action may be impossible to believe. The science may be silly. The characters may be simple and boring.
But, other people have a feeling of nostalgia for Space Opera. They think these stories from the golden age of science fiction have a special feeling of wonder and excitement. Edward E. (Doc) Smith may be the first important writer of this type of SF. He wrote two series called "Skylark" and "Lensman". These are important early examples of Space Opera novels. Flash Gordon is an early example of this genre from radio, TV, and film.
Modern examples include: Alastair Reynolds' "Revelation Space" series, Peter F. Hamilton's "The Dreaming Void", "The Night's Dawn", and "Pandora's Star" series. The very popular Star Wars movies and books are also examples of this sort of SF.

Inland taipan

The Inland Taipan ("Oxyuranus microlepidotus"), or the Fierce Snake, is a snake in Australia and is the most venomous snake on Earth. It belongs to the Elapidae family. Although it is poisonous, it does not bite easily, and prefers to escape from trouble.
However, the inland taipan can be very fatal when it bites. One bite from it contains enough venom to kill about 100 people at once.

Cosmological argument

The cosmological argument is an attempt to prove the existence of God by the fact that things exist. It assumes that things must have a cause, and that the chain of causes can only end by a supernatural event. Other names for the argument are argument from universal causation, argument from first cause, causal argument and argument from existence. 
The universe exists, so there must be something that caused the universe. The first cause is claimed to be God. Thomas Aquinas said that God is the only thing that was not caused by something else, and that God created the cause of existence. The idea has been popular with many theologians and philosophers.

Charles Worth

Charles Frederick Worth (Bourne, Lincolnshire, 13 October 1825 – Paris, 10 March 1895), widely considered the Father of Haute Couture, was an English fashion designer of the 19th century, whose works were produced in Paris. The Parisien "Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture" was his conception. It has the legal authority to decide who may use the term "haute couture".
Worth made his mark in the French fashion industry. He worked at several prosperous London drapery shops before moving to Paris in 1846. He was hired by Gagelin and Opigez, well-known Parisian drapers. While working in their shop, he married one of the firm's models, Marie Vernet. Worth made a few simple dresses for his wife and customers started to ask for copies of the dresses as well. 
Worth, by now a junior partner in the firm, urged his partners to expand into dressmaking, but they hesitated. Worth found a rich Swede, Otto Bobergh, who was willing to bankroll the venture and opened the dressmaking establishment of Worth and Bobergh in 1858. Worth was soon patronized by the French Empress Eugénie, and after that by many titled, rich, and otherwise notable women. He also dressed actresses such as Sarah Bernhardt and singers such as Nellie Melba. Many of his customers travelled to Paris from other countries, coming from as far away as New York and Boston. 
He removed excessive ruffles and frills and used rich fabrics in simple, but flattering, outlines. He is credited as the first designer to put labels onto the clothing he manufactured.
Worth gave his customers luxurious materials and exact fit. Rather than let the customer dictate the design, as had previously been dressmaking practice, four times a year he displayed model dresses at fashion shows. This was the start of the fashion show as we know it.
His patronesses would pick a model, which would then be sewn in fabrics of their choice and tailored to their figure. Worth was sufficiently fashionable that he had to turn away customers. This only added to his fame. He completely revolutionized the business of dressmaking. He was the first of the couturiers, dressmakers considered artists rather than mere artisans.
Worth and Bobergh shut down during the Franco-Prussian War and re-opened in 1871, without Bobergh, as the House of Worth. Worth took his sons, Gaston and Jean-Philippe, into his business and the couture house continued to flourish after his death in 1895.
The great fashion dynasty finally came to an end in 1952 when Charles Frederick Worth's great-grandson, Jean-Charles (1881–1962), retired from the family business. In 1954, the House merged with Paquin. Then in 1956 it was closed. 
Worth was one of the first couture houses to give its name to a luxury perfume. In 1924 Les Parfums Worth launched the first fragrance, "Dans La Nuit" and Rene Lalique, the world renowned glass-maker, designed the bottle. Between the wars, the House produced five perfumes: "Dans La Nuit" (1924), "Vers le Jours" (1925), "Sans Adieu" (1929), "Je Reviens" (1932), and "Vers Toi" (1934).
"Je Reviens" remains the most famous of Worth's perfumes. The perfume became a favoured gift from soldiers to their sweethearts during WWII. The top London store Harrods offers the perfume in its classic blue ridged bottle, which dates back to the perfume’s original launch. 
The House of Worth has re-emerged. Dilesh Mehta (perfumes) and Martin McCarthy (fashion) recently combined their intellectual properties for Worth perfume and apparel. This meant, for the first time since the 1920s, the House is reunited and restored. 
The House of Worth resumed in January 2010 with a revival couture collection by Giovanni Bedin. The spring/summer collection was unveiled in Paris at "Les Salons France-Amêriques" and the winter collection in Milan. Bedin's exquisite corsets and tutus with clouds of tulle and antique lace echo Worth's ideas. Customers include Scarlett Johansson, Kylie Minogue and Charlize Theron. 
The spectacle of couture is just one aspect of the restored House of Worth. Complementing this is a presentation of "Le Prêt-a-Porter" (ready-to-wear). Worth’s "Je Reviens" perfume will be relaunched, followed in 2011 by the House of Worth’s lingerie and accessories, such as couture jewelry and made-to-measure gloves.

Stagecoach

A stagecoach is a type of horse drawn coach for passengers and goods. They were one of the first forms of organized public transport and originated in the 1600s in Great Britain. Before railways were invented in the first part of the nineteenth century they were the fastest way to travel long distances. Stage coaches were operated across Europe and North America. 
The coach would travel between stops called "stages" at which passengers could obtain food and drink and the horses that pulled the coach would be changed for fresh ones. Regularly changing horses meant the coach could travel much faster than other vehicles. They were mostly of light weight construction which also allowed them to go faster. Their speed meant they were used to carry mail and often called a mail coach.
The name is sometimes shortened to simply a "stage".

Firestone Tire and Rubber Company

The Firestone Tire and Rubber Company is a tire company founded by Harvey Firestone in 1900. They supplied air filled tires for wagons, buggies, and other forms of wheeled vehicles common at the time. Firestone soon saw the possibility for increasing sales by making tires for automobiles. The company was a early leader in the mass production of tires. Firestone become the original equipment supplier of Ford Motor Company automobiles. They also sold a lot of replacement tires.
In 1988, the company was sold to the Japanese Bridgestone Corporation. It is now known as Bridgestone Firestone.
Firestone was originally based in Akron, Ohio. That was also the home of its rival, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. The company initiated operations in 1900 with 12 employees. Together, Firestone and Goodyear were the largest suppliers of automotive tires in North America for over three-quarters of a century. In 1906 Firestone was chosen by Henry Ford for the Model T.
At one point, the company had a rubber plantation in Liberia that covered more than 4,000 square kilometers (1 million acres).
During World War II the company make artillery shells, aluminum kegs for food transport and other rubberized military products. In the 1940s, Firestone was given a defense contract to produce plastic helmet liners. 
In 1951, Firestone was given the defense contract for the MGM-5 Corporal missile. In 1961, Firestone acquired the Dayton Tire division from the Dayco Corporation.
In late 1979, Firestone brought in John Nevin as president. He was the former head of Zenith Electronics. Firestone was more than a billion dollars in debt at the time, and losing 250 million dollars a year. Nevin closed nine of the company's seventeen manufacturing plants. He moved the company Akron to Chicago. He split the non-tire related businesses from the main company. In 1988 Nevin negotiated the sale of the company to the Japanese company Bridgestone. Bridgestone Corporation Japan was able to buy the company for much less than it had been worth a decade and a half earlier. The combined Bridgestone Firestone North American operations are now based in Nashville, Tennessee.
Firestone has been a major tire supplier for Formula One teams. From to they supplied tires to a number of teams, including Ferrari, Team Lotus, and Honda. They had 121 cars start the race on their tires, winning 49 of those races. They were on the winning car of every Indianapolis 500 race from 1950 to 1960. These years, the Indy 500 was part of the Formula One world championship series. Their last win came in the 1972 Italian Grand Prix. Firestone has four Drivers World Championships and three Constructors World Championships with teams using their tires.
In 1950, Firestone along with General Motors and Standard Oil were charged and convicted of criminal conspiracy for their part in the "Great American streetcar scandal". The scandal included buying streetcar systems all across the United States. They would shut them down, and replacing them with buses.
Radial tires were introduced to the US market by rivals Goodrich and Michelin in the late 1960s. Firestone lacked a radial. The first radial tire design and built by Firestone was the Firestone 500 Radial. Manufacturing of the new tire was done on equipment designed to build bias-ply tires. 
During the 1970s, Firestone had major problems with the Firestone 500 radial. At high speeds, the steel-belted radials started showing signs that the tread was coming apart from the tire. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) investigation found that the tread separation problem was most likely a design defect affecting all Firestone 500's. 
In 1977 Firestone recalled of 400,000 tires produced at the Decatur plant. Firestone blamed the problems on the consumer. They said the problems were caused by under inflation and poor maintenance. On October 20, 1978, Firestone recalled over 7 million Firestone 500 tires. Congressional hearings took place in 1978. The tire was found to be defective and the cause of 34 deaths. In May 1980 NHTSA fined Firestone $500,000 USD. At that time was the largest fine imposed on any U.S. corporation. Several lawsuits were settled out of court. The bad publicity hurt the company's sales and share price badly.
In 1926, Firestone opened one of the world's biggest rubber plantations in Liberia, West Africa. The International Labor Rights Fund said about Firestone, Firestone's management denied these claims. They said the corporation provided employment, pensions, and health care to thousands of Liberians. The company also provides education and training opportunities to employees and their children.
In May 2006, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) released a report on the state of human rights on Liberia's rubber plantations. According to the report, Firestone did not monitor child labor very well. UNMIL found that several problems. They included pressure to meet company quotas, incentive to support the family financially, and lack of access to basic education. The report also said that the workers' housing provided by Firestone has not been renovated. They had been built in the 1920s and 1930s.
Dan Adomitis, President of Firestone Natural Rubber Company, talked to CNN about the production quotas and child labor. He said that a worker will tap about 650 trees a day, and spend a couple of minutes at each tree. CNN pointed out the 650 trees, at two minutes per tree, is 1,300 minutes. That is more than 21 hours of work a day.
In response to the claims, Dan Adomitis said:
In 1996, several state agencies in Arizona began having big problems with Firestone tires on Ford Explorers. Firestone conducted an investigation of the complaints, tested the tires and asserted that the tires had been abused or under-inflated.
According to Joan Claybrook of the group Public Citizen, Ford also played a large part. They said Ford told Firestone to add a nylon ply to the tires it manufactured in Venezuela for additional strength. Ford changed the suspension to Explorers available in Venezuela. Ford did not ask for the nylon ply for U.S.-made Firestone tires. And they did it change the Explorer suspension on US models.
There was a very high failure rate in Firestone's "Wilderness AT", "Firestone ATX", and "ATX II" tires. Several lawsuits were filed. There was a mandatory recall of the tires. In 2001 Bridgestone Firestone stopped working with Ford because they did not trust Ford. They said Ford had not listened to warnings by Bridgestone Firestone about the design of the Ford Explorer. In 2006, Firestone announced a new effort to recall the same tires recalled in 2000. More of the tires had been linked to recent deaths and injuries. Firestone estimates 97% of the tires were replaced in the 2000 recall. They are still concerned over spare tires that owners did not think to replace.
"Where the Rubber Meets the Road" is an advertisement jingle (short song) that was frequently used in the 1960s and 1970s, especially on televised sporting events.

High heels

High heels are shoes where the heels are much higher than the toes. They are a fashion item for women, and may also be worn by men. Both cowboy boots and 'Cuban heels' are shoes worn by men with higher heels.
It matters a great deal how high the heels are. Heels of 2½ inches (6cm) are standard for ballroom dancing and certainly quite safe for wear once the user has experience with them. A ballroom dance competition may last, with intervals, for ten hours and is physically very demanding. Any ill effect on a girl's performance would be noticed. These lower heels are safe. The standard style for ballroom dancing is the "court shoe", soled in reverse (chamois) leather, with heels wider than 0.4 inches, wider than the typical stiletto heels. 
If the soles of the shoes are also raised, then they are a quite different kind of shoe: the "platform shoe".
Mid-height heels are from 2½ to 3½ inches (8.5cm). They are an intermediate between standard high heels and "stiletto heels", which are from 4 to 10 inches, made of steel, and very narrow at the base: 0.4 inches or less. They have been widely criticised for the health risks regular wear would bring. They have also been criticised by feminists.
Wedgies or, more properly, shoes with wedge heels, are a compromise type. They raise the heels, and are much more stable than standard high heels. 
Wedges for women were popularized by Salvatore Ferragamo who introduced the design to the Italian market in the late 1930s.
Reasons for wearing high-heels, which are almost exclusively aesthetic, include: 
Reasons against wearing high-heels, which are almost exclusively health and practicality reasons, include:
There are so many types of shoe, and so many differences between people that no type will suit everyone. It is obvious that the higher the heel, the riskier the shoe. The more sensible versions are quite safe; the extreme versions seen on fashion show catwalks are not for everyday wear. A lot depends on their use. Nurses tend to wear flat shoes; office staff may prefer high heels. Despite the critics, high heels have been around for a long time, and are probably going to stay.

Gangrene

Gangrene is a serious medical condition that causes the decay and death of body tissue, usually in the extremities such as the fingers, hands, toes, and feet. The two main types of gangrene are dry gangrene and wet gangrene. A third less common type is a form of wet gangrene known as gas gangrene. A very rare type which affects the internal organs is known as internal gangrene. 
Dry gangrene is usually caused by a loss of blood supply to the affected area, such as may happen following an injury which damages the blood vessels to the affected area. Wet gangrene usually occurs when a wound becomes infected with various types of bacteria. Gas gangrene is usually caused by "clostridium" bacteria and mainly affects the muscles. Internal gangrene affects the internal organs, usually the intestines, gallbladder, or appendix.
There are a number of risk factors which increase a person's chances of getting gangrene. These includes advanced blockage of the arteries in medical conditions such as diabetes.

<doc id="264737" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264737" title="Hair follicle">
Hair follicle

A hair follicle is a part of the skin, which grows a hair by packing old cells together. Attached inside the top of the follicle are sebaceous glands, which are tiny sebum-producing glands in almost all skin except on the palms, lips and soles of the feet. The thicker the hair, the more the number of sebaceous glands there are.
Also attached to the follicle is a tiny bundle of muscle fiber, called the "arrector pili", which is responsible for causing the follicle lissis to become more perpendicular (upright) to the surface of the skin. The muscle area can also cause the follicle to stick up slightly above the nearby skin (piloerection) with a pore incased with skin oil. This process results in goose bumps (or goose flesh). Stem cells are at the junction of the arrector and the follicle, and are principally responsible for the ongoing hair production during a process known as the Anagen stage.
The average growth rate of healthy hair follicles on the scalp is nearly per month.
At the base of the follicle is a structure that is called the papilla. The papilla is made up mainly of connective tissue and a capillary loop. Cell division in the papilla is either rare or non-existent.
Around the papilla is the hair matrix, a collection of epithelial cells often mixed with the pigment-producing (color) cells, known as melanocytes. Cell division in the hair matrix is responsible for the cells that will form the major structures of the hair fiber and the inner root sheath. The hair matrix epithelium is one of the fastest-growing cell areas in the human body, which is why some forms of chemotherapy which kill dividing cells or radiotherapy may lead to temporary hair loss. The papilla is usually oval or pear-shaped, with the matrix wrapped almost totally around it, except for a short stalk-like connection to the surrounding connective tissue that provides access for the capillary.
The root sheath is composed of an external (outside) and internal (inside) root sheath. The external root sheath appears empty with cuboid cells when stained with H&E stain. The internal root sheath is composed of three layers, Henle's layer, Huxley's layer, and an internal cuticle that is continuous with the outer layer of the hair fiber.
The hair fiber is composed of a cuticle that is continuous with the root sheath, an intermediate cortex, and an inner medulla.
The bulge is in the outer root sheath at the insertion point of the arrector pili muscle. It houses several types of stem cells, which supply the entire hair follicle with new cells, and take part in healing the epidermis after a wound.
Other structures associated with the hair follicle include arrector pili muscles, sebaceous glands and apocrine sweat glands. Hair follicle nerve receptors sense the position of the hairs.
Before a baby is born, the epithelium and underlying mesenchyma interact to form hair follicles.
Hair grows in cycles of various phases: anagen is the growth phase; catagen is the involuting or regressing phase; and telogen, the resting or quiescent (still) phase. Each phase has several morphologically and histologically distinguishable sub-phases. Prior to the start of cycling is a phase of follicular morphogenesis (formation of the follicle). There is also a shedding phase, or exogen, that is independent of anagen and telogen in which one of several hairs that might arise from a single follicle exits. Normally up to 90% of the hair follicles are in anagen phase while, 10–14% are in telogen and 1–2% in catagen phase. The cycle's length varies on different parts of the body. For eyebrows, the cycle is completed in around 4 months, while it takes the scalp 3–4 years to finish; this is the reason eyebrow hairs have a much shorter length limit compared to hairs on the head. Growth cycles are controlled by a chemical signal like epidermal growth factor.
Anagen is the active growth phase of hair follicles. The cells in the root of the hair are dividing rapidly, adding to the hair shaft. During this phase the hair grows about 1 cm every 28 days. Scalp hair stays in this active phase of growth for 2–7 years. The amount of time the hair follicle stays in the anagen phase is genetically determined. At the end of the anagen phase an unknown signal causes the follicle to go into the catagen phase.
The catagen phase is a short transition stage that occurs at the end of the anagen phase. It signals the end of the active growth of a hair. This phase lasts for about 2–3 weeks while a club hair is formed.
The telogen phase is the resting phase of the hair follicle. The club hair is the final product of a hair follicle in the telogen stage, and is a dead, fully keratinized hair. Fifty to one-hundred club hairs are shed daily from a normal scalp.

Pirelli

Pirelli & C. SpA is a diverse (it does many things) company based in Milan, Italy. It operates in many countries.
Pirelli was founded 1872 in Milan by Giovanni Battista Pirelli. Pirelli initially worked in rubber and related processes. The company used to make scuba diving rebreathers (a special type of underwater breathing machine). Pirelli's activities are still focused on the building of tyres and cables (for energy and telecommunications). In 2005, Pirelli sold its cable division to Goldman Sachs, which changed the new group's name to "Prysmian".
In the 1950s, Alberto Pirelli had the famous Milanese skyscraper built. It is in the same area as the first Pirelli factory in the 19th century.
In 1974, Pirelli invented the "wide radial tyre". This was at the request from the Lancia rally racing team. They needed a tyre strong enough for their new Stratos.
Later, Porsche started using the same tyres with the Porsche 911 Turbo.
Today, the wide tyres are still the standard in sport & racing cars.
The "Pirelli Calendar" is published once a year. It often features famous actresses and fashion models. The calendar also features the work of many well respected fashion photographers.
The "Pirelli Internetional Award" is given annually for the best international multimedia involving the communication of Science & Technology conducted entirely on the Internet.
"Power is nothing without control" is the slogan of Pirelli Tyre Company.
Pirelli is the long time main sponsor of Italian football club "F.C. Internazionale Milano".
Pirelli has a history of sponsoring football teams. Pirelli is known for its long term primary sponsorship of the Italian football team Internazionale Milano F.C. Pirelli also supports rally. Pirelli Star Driver is an project to support young rally drivers. It is organised by Pirelli and the FIA.
Since 2007, Pirelli is the only tyre brand used in the FIM World Superbike Championship. The tyres are also used in the support classes.
Pirelli has the contract for the control tyre supply in the British Superbike Championship. This contract started in 2008 and will last until 2010 at least.
Pirelli is the official tyre supplier of the World Rally Championship. They replaced BF Goodrich for the 2008 season.
Pirelli competed in Formula One in three distinct periods. The first time was between and . The second time was between and . The third time was between and . They started 200 Grands Prix races, and won 44 of them.
Pirelli will return to the sport in as the sole tyre supplier. Bridgestone decided to withdraw as the supplier at the end of .
To test the new F1 tyre, Pirelli signed Nick Heidfeld. A 2009 version of a Toyota Racing chassis is being used to test the tyres. The testing is taking place during the second half of the season. In September 2010, Heidfeld was signed by Sauber to race the remainder of the season. Pirelli then hired former GP2 and Renault F1 driver Romain Grosjean to test for them.

University of Western Australia

The University of Western Australia (UWA) was opened in February 1911. It is the oldest university in the state of Western Australia. The law that set up the university was the University of Western Australia Act 1911. The Act sets out how the University is to be managed by a Senate, which can make rules and regulations. These are included in the University Calendar.
One of the best and most respected universities in Australia, UWA is also highly ranked internationally. To date UWA has close to 100 Rhodes Scholars and one Nobel Prize winner, Barry Marshall. The University joined the "Matariki Network of Universities" as the youngest member, being the only established university from the 20th century.
The University was first set up in Irwin Street, in the centre of Perth. It was housed in several buildings between Hay Street and St George's Terrace. Irwin Street was also known as "Tin Pan Alley" because many of the buildings had corrugated iron roofing. These buildings were the university campus until 1932, when the campus moved to its present-day site in Crawley (). 
In the 1910s the founding Chancellor, Sir John Winthrop Hackett, gave over £425,000 to the University. This allowed the building of its magnificent main buildings at the present-day campus. Many buildings and landmarks within the University are named after him, including Winthrop Hall and Hackett Hall.
A part of the original buildings is still in use, called the "Irwin Street Building". In the 1930s it was moved to the new campus. In 1987 it was repaired and moved to James Oval. Recently, the building was the Senate meeting room and is now used as a cricket pavilion and storage space for the University Archives. The building has been heritage-listed by both the National Trust and the Australian Heritage Commission.
The University has nine Faculties:
UWA is one of the largest landowners in Perth, though government grants and private gifts. Recent developments include the $22 million University Club, opened in June 2005, the UWA Watersports Complex, opened in August 2005, the $64 million Molecular and Chemical Sciences building opened in September 2005 and a $30 million Business School building opened in May 2009. A new $360 million medical research facility is due to begin in early 2009 and be completed by the end of 2011.
The 65-hectare Crawley campus is next to the Swan River, and located 5 km from the Perth central business district. Many of the buildings are made from limestone, including the Winthrop Hall with its Romanesque architecture. These buildings are built amongst large lawns and thickets of trees such as the Sunken Garden and the Tropical Grove. The beauty of the grounds and rich history of the campus make it a popular spot for weddings. 
The Arts Faculty building includes the New Fortune Theatre. This is a copy of the original Elizabethan Fortune Theatre and the only one of its kind in the southern hemisphere. Since 1995 the open air theatre has had regular performances of Shakespeare's plays, put on by the Graduate Dramatic Society and the University Dramatic Society. The theatre is also home to a family of peafowl given to the University by the Perth Zoo. 
The Berndt Museum of Anthropology, on the ground floor of the Social Sciences Building, holds the finest collection of Aboriginal art in the world according to the Collections Australia Network (CAN). Its Asian and Melanesian collections are also of strong interest. Begun in 1976 by Ronald and Catherine Berndt, it works in close collaboration with Aboriginal communities.
The University of Western Australia has seven main subject libraries on campus. This includes the architecturally recognised Reid Library building, the largest library on campus with four publicly accessible levels. Five of the libraries are located on campus, with the other two being located within walking distance.
Several residential colleges are located close to the campus, including Currie Hall, St George's College, St Catherine's College, Trinity and St Thomas More College.
The University started a UWA Albany Centre in 1999 to meet rural education needs. In 2005, Curtin University of Technology joined UWA in Albany to offer extra courses. UWA Albany has postgraduate coursework and research programs through the Institute for Regional Development and the Centre of Excellence in Natural Resource Management. The UWA Rural Clinical School sends fifth-year medical students to study for a year in Albany, Derby, Broome, Port Hedland, Karratha, Geraldton, Bunbury, Narrogin, Esperance, or Kalgoorlie. The University is also involved in the Combined Universities Centre for Rural Health in Geraldton.
The University has other buildings across Stirling Highway in Nedlands. These are linked by pedestrian underpasses beneath the highway, and paths in front of the residential colleges. The University also has buildings in Claremont, purchased in 2005 from Edith Cowan University. The University calls this "UWA Claremont". The University remains a single campus institution. UWA Claremont is approximately 5 km west of the main Crawley campus. Further west still, the University also has staff in central Claremont.
Overseas, the University has links with institutions in Malaysia and Singapore, where students can study for The University of Western Australia qualifications.
UWA's students are mainly from Western Australia, and mostly from Perth. In recent years, numbers of full-fee paying foreign students, mainly from Southeast Asia, have grown. In 2008, the University had 3,958 international students, part of a total of 19,000 students.
The University of Western Australia has formal agreements with 44 international institutions. It encourages staff and student exchanges, collaborative research and exchange of teaching materials and methods. The University also teaches several of its programmes in Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines. 
In May 2010 University joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Dartmouth College (USA), Durham University (UK), Queen’s University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of Tübingen (Germany) and Uppsala University (Sweden).
The University has over 80 research centres, including the Crime Research Centre, the Centre for Forensic Science, the Centre for Water Research and the Centre for Oil and Gas Engineering.
A new project is the Zadko Telescope. A local businessman, James Zadko, and his family gave money to buy a robotically controlled 1-metre modified Ritchey-Chrétien telescope (F/4 equatorially mounted flat field). The telescope will built at the UWA's Gravity Discovery Centre and Southern Cross Cosmos Centre 70 km north of Perth on Wallingup Plain, near the town of Gingin. Working together with the European Union's satellites, it will be used to find major supernovas.
The University of Western Australia, with $20 million from the state government, will build an international radio astronomy research centre on UWA's Perth campus. UWA is behind Australia's bid to be the site of the Square Kilometer Array, a very large internationally funded radio astronomy installation capable of seeing the early stages of the formation of galaxies, stars and planets.
The UWA Student Guild is the main student group on campus. It is part of the National Union of Students. The Guild provides many services to students, including running cafes and financial help. There are also over 80 clubs and societies paid for by the Guild. The Guild publishes the student newspaper, Pelican, as well as several other publications.
UWA Sports has a recreation centre, a fitness centre, aquatic centre (Human Movement) as well as a watersports complex (on the Swan River), a boat shed, a sports shop and physiotherapy. Off campus they run the UWA Sports Park (MacGillivray Oval) with athletics, baseball, cricket, football, hockey, rugby, soccer and ultimate frisbee fields. The UWA Tennis Centre is next to Challenge Stadium & UWA Sports Park. UWA Shenton Recreation Park also has a gym, indoor sports hall, tennis courts and a hockey turf.
UWA has many famous students, particularly in politics and government. The list includes many premiers of Western Australia including Geoff Gallop, Richard Court and Alan Carpenter; former Deputy Prime Minister Kim Beazley, and his father Kim Edward Beazley, and 23rd Prime Minister of Australia Bob Hawke.
The University also many famous science and medicine students, including Nobel prize winner Barry Marshall, the Australian of the Year for 2003 Fiona Stanley and the Australian of the Year for 2005 Fiona Wood.
The former head of Ansett Airlines and British Airways, Sir Rod Eddington, is a graduate of the UWA School of Engineering.
Sports alumni include former Kookaburras Captain and Hockeyroos Coach Ric Charlesworth.
UWA set up a publishing section in 1935, when the University was the only university in Western Australia.
UWA started a Second Life project in mid-2009. (Second Life is a 3D online virtual world open to the public, free of charge.) By early 2010 it was the most active Second Life project of any Australian university. The UWA site covers three islands (projected to expand), with several models of historic buildings from the Crawley campus, a virtual lecture hall which is used to run real lectures, and a facility where the capabilities of Second Life are being explored for use in scientific visualisation research. During 2009-2010, UWA in Second Life is running a monthly art contest, attracting around 70 artists and many visitors from around the world. Every month a new set of artworks are submitted and the community, together with a judging panel, select winners in a number of categories, who are then awarded cash prizes.

Gastritis

Gastritis is an inflammation of the lining of the stomach. It has many possible causes. The main causes are drinking too much alcohol, or using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (also known as NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen for too long. Sometimes gastritis starts after major surgery, serious injury, burns, or infections. People who have had weight loss surgery may also get gastritis. Long term causes are infection with bacteria, mainly "Helicobacter pylori". Certain diseases, such as pernicious anemia, chronic bile reflux, stress and certain autoimmune disorders can cause gastritis as well. The most common symptom is abdominal pain. Other symptoms are indigestion, abdominal bloating, nausea, and vomiting. Some may have a feeling of fullness or burning in the upper abdomen. A gastroscopy, blood test, complete blood count test, or a faeces test may be used to diagnose gastritis. Treatment includes taking antacids or other medicines, such as proton pump inhibitors or antibiotics, and avoiding hot or spicy foods. For those with pernicious anemia, B injections are given.

Wikipedia:Advanced template coding

This essay, Wikipedia:Advanced template coding, describes some techniques to improve the display or editing of templates in Wikipedia. Some ways are explained for debugging template parameters in the MediaWiki markup language. Most of the tips involve use of common text-editors. While some special software packages exist, to allow customized editing, they are often not available when travelling to other computers for wiki-editing.
Perhaps the most important issue to note, about complex templates, is the fact that the markup language is very reliable for complex template coding, even with complex calculations, so most template problems are often caused by obscure coding errors, rather than by bugs inside the MediaWiki software. The bugs inside the parser are so rare that most people will never experience one. Most problems are due to awkward features in the markup language, which lead to coding errors. For example, omitting a leading brace "{" at parameter } causes it to be read as " }", as meaning to invoke Template:1 + "}".
Some techniques here are beyond the basics written about in the Wikipedia help-page "" which lists almost all basic options of template coding, also showing examples of each.
Inside a single template, the nesting limit is 40 nested expressions, such as 40 multiple "if-then-else-if...". At the 41st nested "if" keyword, then an error message might appear as: "Exceeded nesting limit". However, when not nested beyond 40 levels, then a template can contain hundreds of if-expressions and switch-branches (but not all nested inside the others).
Some templates have contained complex conditional calculations nested over 19 levels deep, for years. Also, some templates have contained hundreds of if-expressions, for years, just NOT all nested as one, giant: "if-then-else-else-else-else-else...".
An issue which complicates template processing, for parameters, is the wiki-formatting of parameter contents when inside of if-logic (such as #if or #ifeq). As of August 2010, the MediaWiki markup parser is wiki-formatting the contents of parameters when "inside" #if-expressions (but not outside). This means that parameters containing spaces/semicolon can change their values while inside the if-clauses (surprise!). So, for example, a parameter } when outside an #if can display differently than inside . The worst shock is when parameter 4 contains a leading semicolon, which triggers formatting to become ye-olde bolded semicolon-header-line:
The problem occurs whether inside of #if, #ifexpr or #ifeq markup expressions. If the parameter is preceded by text, in either of the then/else clauses, then the wiki-formatting inside the parameter does not occur. This situation might be relatively rare, but this is just a reminder: for showing the true contents of a template parameter, try to display a parameter "outside" the start of any if-statement clauses, or else prepare for some shocking results when a parameter is wiki-formatted for display inside the if-logic.
Many coding errors can be debugged, more easily, by attempting to isolate the code section where coding errors most likely occurred. Intense proofreading, of the logic flow, is most often the quickest fix, such as checking for typical syntax errors (see below: "Common coding errors"). Sometimes, a section of troublesome code could be copied into a short test page, then edit-preview tested there, separately. However, if editing that extra-page window seems like too much effort, then consider merely copying the code to the top of the current template. Similarly, a template could be developed, in the early stages, as multiple sections of code, each to be debugged separately, then eventually joined together, such as nested sections with if-then-else-if.
As a review of those options, consider:
Next, the testing, of each section of code, is crucial. There are some age-old adages to heed:
Perhaps put a variety of examples on each template's doc subpage, to help detect problems early in development. However, for complex templates, then the talk-page, or a special subpage "/testcases", should contain a section of numerous examples (a whole lot of them) to demonstrate the full scope of template features.
When developing sections of markup that use template parameters, try to always set each parameter with a default value, especially inside expressions or if-logic coding:
If a particular parameter is given the same default value across the whole page, then that value could be easily changed, in a text editor, by a global search-and-replace string substitution, to change the default value to some other value, for testing each case.
If those parameters are not given default values, then those sections of code cannot be tested, during edit-preview, while editing the template. Any parameter without a default value will become the literal triple-brace text (such as the literal 7 characters: }), and non-defaulted parameters cannot be evaluated, in expressions or if-logic, during an edit-preview of the template page.
There are several common coding errors which will cause problems when processing templates. The following can be used as a checklist, to help debug problems, when a template seems to be acting bizarre:
Note that those common coding errors could have been easily spotted by a simple syntax checker, such as warning that 3&2 braces could be trouble: "" is treated as "{Template:Size" trying to pass 180px as the parameter because of only 2 end-braces.
Again, always checking first for common errors, as the first step, can avoid time hunting for "complex errors" which never really existed. Remember: the MediaWiki markup language is extremely error-prone, so that's why so many coding errors occur, and that's why:
Many hideous problems truly are merely 1-minute syntax fixes.

Wikipedia:Advanced Convert coding

This essay, Wikipedia:Advanced Convert coding, describes some ways to improve or expand the use of the Wikipedia unit-converter, . Most of the tips involve setting the parameters.
Some techniques here are beyond the basics described in the Convert docpage ("") which explains almost all basic options of the parameters, also showing examples of each. The currently supported units are listed under . Several options presented here have been discussed under .
Most of the subtemplates used by , on Simple Wikipedia, have been copied from the same name on English Wikipedia.
"24-Sep-2010:" Using option "disp=x" (such as "disp=x| « | »") will insert custom text/separators around the output amount (added: September 2010). Here are some live examples:
Any spaces in those parameters will appear in the output. This option disp=x will allow editors to vary the wording, to avoid monotonous repetitions, and perhaps combine live conversions with other hand-coded numbers as the customized text.
More subtemplates must be created to allow the option disp=x to work in ranges or non-abbreviated units. The concept of customizing the output format has been considered for years, but the former stumbling block had been the end-round parameter "|1" which is treated here as parameter 6 when disp=x, and that allows customization to proceed. I have been studying this issue for years, so I don't foresee any major complications, for general usage of disp=x. However, more unit-subtemplates will need to be updated to pass parameters 5/6/7 so that the ending text can be specified for any unit, not just for miles, feet, or metres. Also, we might be able to replace disp=s using disp=x and reduce perhaps a few hundred other subtemplates that are not used very much, as being deprecated, in favor of using disp=x. Note that a semicolon can be specified by "disp=x|; " to separate by semicolon.
"29-Oct-09:" There are options now to control the input versus the output-abbreviations (similar to linking as options lk=in or lk=out). There are now 5 settings for abbreviation:
This is the first time it has been possible to abbreviate just the input units, using abbr=in, and leave full-word form as the output: such as "xx km (xx miles)":
For many conversions, the default has been "abbr=out" so that the km/mi conversions have stated "xx kilometres (xx mi)". The other options (in/out) were added for completeness, to allow anything: in, out, both or none. However, the logical preference seems to be abbr=in, because for most articles where the culture is metric, then "km" would be obvious, but other readers might wonder about "mi". The use of abbr=in gives "xx km (xx miles)" and also avoids the end-spelling of -metre/meter which has been irritating to some readers. Anyway, this is the first time for users to have a choice of abbreviating just the input unit-names.
When invoking , the end-parameter can be a number to designate the level of rounding, such as "0" for whole numbers, "1" for 1 decimal, "2" for 2 decimals, "-2" for whole hundreds, etc. For example:
The use of the rounding-parameter can be altered by using sigfig=3 (or similar) to control the precision of the output amounts.
"04-Nov-2009:" In some instances, a converted result should be rounded to the nearest 5 units, rather than the nearest 1 unit. For now, this can be done by using a math-expression outside a conversion. The algorithm is:  round5 = (n/5 round 0) * 5. For example, in metres-to-feet:
In general, for any number rounded to the nearest 5:
Larger numbers will require removing commas by {{formatnum: 1,234|R}}:
Although the need to round by 5's is rare, similar coding can be used to adjust the results in other ways.
"04-Nov-2009:" To suppress commas, use either option "adj=nocomma" or "abbr=comma" to abbreviate (remove) commas from the display. So, the results would be as follows:
The option "adj=nocomma" can also be used when comma is the separator ("disp=comma") to simplify the results, as showing only 1 comma: .
The template has parameters to alter the display-format, such as abbr=on to abbreviate all units, or disp=comma to use a comma-separator. However, there might be a need for a customized display, beyond the formats offered as parameters. For maximum customization, use the options to show only the results:
By using those options, all the surrounding text can be customized, with any words or wikilinks, as needed. For example, use:
Then, the surrounding text can be any wording:
With that customization, any extra words can be inserted, such as "equivalent" or "range" or "temperature" (etc.) to surround the result (of "82 to 88 °F").
"10-Nov-2009:" The display option disp=flip can be used to flip the result as first in order:<br> gives: <br>   gives: <br>   gives: 
So, the option "disp=flip" will flip and reverse the order of the output, inverting the result as first in the text and the input unit as last (in reverse order). To abbreviate as with typical unit symbols, then use abbr=in to abbreviate the input appearing as output.
The display type disp=unit will display just the unit name (as singular, plural or hyphenated) for an input-unit symbol:
The option disp=unit can also be used, during article writing, as a means to display a unit name or symbol for a specific unit-code when writing an article.
"06-Nov-2009:" The subtemplate , for 3-amount conversions, allows any mixture of "to" or "by" or "x" or "-" or "and" (etc.) as the range-words; plus the separator can also be a semicolon, using disp=semi:
The input units (like "metre") can be abbreviated or linked, using parameters abbr=in, abbr=on, lk=on or lk=in.
"08-Nov-2009:" It is becoming far more difficult to implement new options, as the number of Convert-subtemplates grows by hundreds each time. Recently, over 650 new subtemplates were added, but we should prepare to reduce those in the next few months. See essay: ". It would be easier to control commas by: comma=off, comma=in, comma=out, comma=on. Plus, some people want to round the input amount, such as round=in, round=out (current default), or round=on. Unless the current design is condensed, those new options could require modifying hundreds of subtemplates.
Before October 2009, the talk-page had been the only notice of new Convert subtemplates. However, the " is a separate category for newer subtemplates. It can be listed, to see new subtemplate names. Insert that category-link at the bottom of new templates.
Just like with creating new article-pages, users are allowed to create new unit-conversion subtemplates. For example, someone might want to use "kilograms-per-centimetre" (kg/cm) as a variation of the typical per-metre conversion (using "kg/m"):
The new subtemplate would be named "Template:Convert/kg/cm" with the coding copied and altered from viewing the template :
Note that the new conversion factor is b=100, as the multiplier from kg/m to kg/cm, based on 1 m = 100 cm.  When editing a conversion-subtemplate, be very careful to match the exact nesting of braces (pairing the "}"); otherwise, the parameters might be treated as literal text and listed across the page instead (such as string of "...| t=linear density | o=lb/yd | b=100...").
The numbered parameters, }, }, }, }, }, } & }, are the first 7 positional parameters passed from using: .
The other parameters are:
Using the new template , the result would be:
There is no limit to the number of conversion-subtemplates that can be created. Again, when editing, be very careful to match the nested-braces (pairing "}"). Each unit-conversion subtemplate is really the coding to invoke another subtemplate (typically invoking for output), so that is the reason why the pairing of braces is critical.
With the option-name parts of subtemplate naming, an option value could be added to quickly connect to a particular variation subtemplate, but there would be hundreds of total variations. For example, using abbr=xyz, the related custom variations can be coded as more than 800 subtemplates named with option-name part "Axyz". However, in general, when a variation is created, only a few dozen of the possible combinations are implemented, and the remaining hundreds are omitted, as future subtemplates "under construction" to complete the particular option.
For option abbr=xyz, the 800 subtemplates would be named as follows:
Due to the vast number of subtemplates, many of the possible combinations are omitted, which could appear as missing templates, someday, when those combinations are selected by a user on a rare occasion.

Susan Greenfield, Baroness Greenfield, (born Hammersmith, London, 1 October 1950) is a British scientist, writer and broadcaster. She specializes in studying how the human brain works and has done a lot of research into diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease which are common in older people. She has written several books and appeared frequently on radio and television. She is very good at explaining what she does to the wide public, using words that ordinary people (non-scientists) can understand. In 1994 she gave the series of Christmas lectures on television for young children.
Susan Greenfield was born in Hammersmith, West London. Her parents were of Russian and Austrian origin. She studied at the University of Oxford and also got a doctorate degree from the College de France in Paris. She is Professor of Pharmacology at the University of Oxford and fellow of Lincoln College. She is the head of a group of 18 scientists who study degenerative brain diseases. Until recently she was director of the Royal Institution.
Susan Greenfield is very well known to the wider public through the books she has written and the lectures she has given on radio and on television. In 1994, she was the first woman to give the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures which were sponsored at that time by the BBC. She called those lectures "Journey to the centre of the brain".
Greenfield frequently lectures about the future of the brain and, in particular, the effect that computers are having in the way we think. She says that computer could be very useful for old people because it keeps their minds active. On the other hand she is worried that young people are using computers too much. Although activities such as video games are good for developing certain skills (such as quick reactions), there are many other skills that we need in life (such as the ability to communicate with people and understand other people’s emotions) that they do not teach us.
Baroness Greenfield sits in the United Kingdom Parliament in the House of Lords as a crossbencher. She does not belong to any particular party.
She has been given many awards, including the CBE for helping the public to understand science. a Chevalier Légion d'Honneur by the French Government. She has been given several honorary degrees and in June 2001, she was made a Life peer, as Baroness Greenfield, of Ot Moor in the County of Oxfordshire.
Greenfield was married to an Oxford University Professor of Physical Chemistry, Peter Atkins; they divorced in 2005.

Sébastien Bourdais

Sébastien Olivier Bourdais (born 28 February 1979 in Le Mans) is a French race car driver. He is one of the most successful drivers in the history of the Champ Car World Series. He won four championships in a row, from 2004 to 2007.
He drove in Formula One for the Toro Rosso team during the 2008 and 2009 seasons. He was unable to repeat his past successes. Bourdais currently drives for Peugeot Sport in the Le Mans Series and for French football club Olympique Lyonnais in the Superleague Formula series.
Born into a racing family, Bourdais began his racing career at age 10 in kart racing. Bourdais progressed to single-seater racing in 1995, finishing 9th in the Formula Campus Championship. He then spent two years in the French Formula Renault Championship. He finished second in points in 1997. In 1998, he won five races to become Rookie of the Year (6th overall) in French F3. He won the series outright in 1999, with eight wins and three poles.
In 2000, Bourdais joined the Prost Junior Team in the International F3000 Championship. He finished ninth in the series. In 2001, he moved to the DAMS team and took his first win in the series. He changed teams again for 2002, joing Super Nova Racing. Bordais had three victories and seven pole positions. He won the championship by two points.
Bourdais moved to Champ Car racing in the United States. He and joined Newman-Haas Racing for the 2003 CART World Series season. At St. Petersburg, Florida, Bourdais became the first rookie since Nigel Mansell to claim pole position for his first race. His first Champ Car victory came at Brands Hatch.
For 2004, Bourdais dominated the Champ Car series. He had seven wins and eight poles in his Lola. His won his first championship. Bourdais won a fourth consecutive Champ Car title in 2007 with victory at Lexmark Indy 300 on October 21.
On 16 March 2008 Bourdais competed in his first Formula One Championship race, the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. He finished the year in 17th place with four points.
Bourdais tested for the Toro Rosso team during the winter. On 6 February 2009 he was confirmed as a Toro Rosso driver for a second year. He had two points finishes in at the Australian Grand Prix and the Monaco Grand Prix. 
On 16 July 2009, Toro Rosso announced that Bourdais would no longer be driving for the team. It was reported that Bourdais was thinking about sueing Toro Rosso, claiming that the team breached his contract. It was then reported that Toro Rosso paid him $2.1 million to avoid legal action.
Bourdais has frequently raced the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans. He entering for the first time in 1999, at the aged of 20. He drove a Porsche 911 GT2 run by Larbre Competition. He returned in 2000, finishing fourth with Emmanuel Clerico and Olivier Grouillard for the Pescarolo team behind the three dominant Audis.
His next three appearances did not go so well. In 2001 his car retired after 271 laps. The next year, he finished ninth in the LMP900 class. He missed the 2003 race and returned in 2004, but his car retired after 282 laps.
Bourdais' next race at Le Mans would come in 2007. He drove a factory-backed Peugeot 908. The car he shared with Stéphane Sarrazin and Pedro Lamy finished the race second. In 2009 he drovr for the Peugeot factory team again. He finished in second place, one lap behind the winning Peugeot. Bourdais was to drive the pole-winning #3 Peugeot in 2010. A suspension failure halted the car before Bourdais could turn a lap in the race
After leaving Formula One, Bourdais signed up to drive the Sevilla FC car in the Superleague Formula series. He won on his debut weekend at the 2009 Estoril round in the Super Final. Bourdais won again at the next round, winning race 1 of the 2009 Monza round. He returned for the 2010 season racing for Olympique Lyonnais.
Bourdais made several appearances in other championships. He won the Spa 24 Hours in 2002 in a Larbre Compétition Chrysler Viper GTS-R. He also won his class at the 2006 12 Hours of Sebring in a Panoz Esperante. In 2005 he also competed in the International Race of Champions, winning his first stock car race at Texas Motor Speedway. In 2009, he set the official lap record at Sebring International Raceway, during the 12 Hours of Sebring. In 2010, Bourdais raced in a Level 5 Motorsports prepared Daytona Prototype in Rolex 24 at Daytona, held at Daytona International Speedway in Florida.
 New points system introduced in 2004
Did not finish the race but was classified as he completed more than 90% of the race

W. Edwards Deming

William Edwards Deming (October 14, 1900 – December 20, 1993) was an American engineer who improved how companies manage making products. He was a statistician, professor, author, lecturer, and consultant. He is perhaps best known for his work in Japan. Starting in 1950, he taught top Japanese business managers how to improve design, product quality, testing and sales. He taught the importance of using Statistical Process Control (SPC), to manage quality by measuring, or counting, many steps of complex manufacturing and services, in order to reduce the variation in results. This should reduce defects and errors. Deming described periodic monitoring, by repeating the steps of Plan-Do-Check-Act, known as the Deming Cycle.
He entered the University of Wyoming at Laramie in 1917 and graduated in 1921. He earned a BSc in electrical engineering. He then went to graduate school. In 1925, he received an M.S. from the University of Colorado. In 1928, he received a Ph.D. from Yale University. Both graduate degrees were in mathematics and mathematical physics.

Yo-yo

The yo-yo is a popular toy made with of a length of string tied at one end to a flat spool. It is used by holding the free end of the string (usually by inserting one finger in a slip knot) and pulling at it so as to cause the spool to turn while it is hanging in mid-air, either winding or unwinding the string. It first became popular in the 1920s.
In the simplest play, the string is wound on the spool by hand. The yo-yo is then thrown downwards, so that it goes down and unwinds the string. It then (by inertia) climbs back, winding the stringt up. Finally the yo-yo is grabbed, ready to be thrown again. Many other trick plays exist, most based on the basic "sleeper" trick.
One of the most famous tricks on the yoyo is "walk the dog". This is done by throwing a strong sleeper and allowing the yoyo to roll across the floor.
English historical names for the yo-yo include "bandalore" (from French) and "quiz". French historical terms include "bandalore", "incroyable", "de Coblenz", "emigrette", and "joujou de Normandie" ("joujou" meaning little toy).
The earliest surviving yo-yo dates to 500 BC and was made using terra cotta (clay) disks. A Greek vase painting from this date shows a boy playing yo-yo(see right). Greek records from this time describe toys made out of wood, metal, or painted terra cotta. The terra cotta disks were used to ceremonially offer the toys of youth to certain gods when a child came of age. Disks of other materials were used for actual play. 
Philippine historical records show that 16th century hunters hiding in trees used a rock tied to a string up to 20 feet in length to throw at wild animals beneath them. The string meant they could get the rock back without having to come down from the tree.

<doc id="264834" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264834" title="Government of Australia">
Government of Australia

The Commonwealth of Australia is a federal constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy. The Commonwealth of Australia was formed in 1901 when the six self-governing British colonies, agreed to join together as one nation. These colonies became the six states of Australia. The written agreement is the Australian Constitution. This was written at a Constitutional Convention and voted for by the people of the colonies.
The way the Australian Government is organized can be looked at in two ways. The first is federalism which organizes the way powers are distributed between the Australian Government and the state governments. The second is separation of powers into legislative, executive and judiciary branches of government. The Constitution supports the separation of powers in the way it sets out the roles of the branches of government. 
Section 1 of the Australian Constitution sets up a democratic legislature, the bicameral Parliament of Australia. This is the Queen and two houses, the Senate and the House of Representatives. Section 51 of the Constitution sets out the Commonwealth Government's legislative powers and gives certain powers and responsibilities (known as "heads of power") to the federal government. All remaining responsibilities are kept by the six States. Each State has its own constitution, so that Australia has seven sovereign Parliaments, none of which can take over the powers of any other. The High Court of Australia rules on any arguments between the Commonwealth and the States, or among the States, about their powers.
The Commonwealth Parliament can propose changes to the Constitution. To become law, the proposals must be put to a referendum of all Australians of voting age. The changes must get a "double majority": a majority of all votes, and a majority of votes in a majority of States.
The Commonwealth Constitution also says that the States can agree to give any of their powers to the Commonwealth. This can be done by an amendment to the Constitution through a referendum. More commonly, if all the states agree, then all state and Commonwealth parliaments pass laws to allow the transfer. These "transfer" laws may have a "sunset clause". This is a part of the law that means the law is only in place for a certain time. After this, the original division of powers is put back.
Australia has several territories, three of which are self-governing: the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), the Northern Territory (NT) and Norfolk Island. The legislatures of these territories have powers given to them by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Parliament keeps the power to overturn territorial legislation and to give or take powers. While Australian citizens living in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are represented in the Commonwealth Parliament, Norfolk Islanders are not.
Australia's other territories, (Jervis Bay, Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands) are not self-governing. Instead, these territories are governed by federal laws, with Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands also having local governments. The largely uninhabited Coral Sea Islands was set up as a Territory of the Commonwealth in 1969. The Ashmore and Cartier Islands has been a territory since 1933 run under the laws of the Northern Territory.
The federal nature of the Commonwealth and the structure of the Parliament of Australia were the subject of long negotiations among the colonies. The House of Representatives is elected on a basis which shows the different sized populations of the States. So New South Wales has 50 members while Tasmania has only five. But the Senate is elected on a basis of equality among the States: all States have 12 Senators, regardless of population. This was so the Senators of the smaller States could form a majority and change or even reject laws from the House of Representatives. The ACT and the NT elect two senators each.
The third level of government after Commonwealth and State/Territory is Local government. These are organized as shires, towns or cities. Local governments are made up of elected representatives (known as either councilor or alderman depending on the State), usually serving on a part-time basis.
Government is undertaken by three inter-connected arms of government:
The "Separation of powers" is the principle whereby the three arms of government do their activities separate from each other:
Before the Australia Act 1986, and matching legislation in the parliament of the United Kingdom, some Australian cases could be sent to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for final appeal. Australian law is now only decided on in Australia, and the High Court of Australia is the highest court of appeal. The possibility of the British Parliament making laws to overturn the Australian Constitution was also removed.
The Legislature makes the laws, and supervises the activities of the other two arms with a view to changing the laws if needed. The Australian Parliament is bicameral, made up of the Queen, a 76-member Senate and a 150-member House of Representatives. Twelve Senators from each state are elected for six-year terms, using proportional representation and the single transferable vote (known in Australia as "preferential voting", with half elected every three years.
There are also two senators elected by voters from the Northern Territory (and including the Indian Ocean Territories, Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands). Another two senators are elected by the voters of the Australian Capital Territory (including the Jervis Bay Territory). Senators from the territories are also elected using preferential voting, however, their term of office is not fixed: it starts on the day of a general election for the House of Representatives and ends the day before the next such election day.
The members of the House of Representatives are elected by preferential voting from single-member areas spread among the states and territories roughly in proportion to population. In ordinary legislation, the two chambers have the same powers, but all laws for spending money or charging taxes must come from the House of Representatives. In the Westminster system, the leader of the political party or group of parties that holds the support of a majority of the members in the House of Representatives is asked to form a government and is named Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to the Parliament, of which they must be members. General elections are held at least once every three years. The Prime Minister can advise the Governor-General to call an election for the House of Representatives at any time, but Senate elections can only be held within certain periods set out in the Constitution. The most recent general election was on 21 August 2010.
The Commonwealth Parliament and all the state and territory legislatures use the Westminster system. They have a recognised Leader of the Opposition, usually the leader of the largest party outside the government. There is also a Shadow Cabinet of Opposition members who "shadow" each member of the Ministry, asking questions on matters about the Minister's responsibilities. The government, because it has a majority of members in the lower house of the legislature, can usually pass its legislation and control the workings of the house. The Opposition can slow down the process and obstruct government business if it chooses. The day-to-day business of the house is usually worked out between a senior Minister, who holds the title Leader of the House, and an Opposition frontbencher known as the Manager of Opposition Business.
The Australian Constitution was written in 1901, when the Dominions of the British Empire were not independent countries, and does not use the words "head of state". In practice, the role of head of state of Australia is divided between two people, the Queen of Australia and the Governor-General of Australia. The Governor- General is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister of Australia. Though in many respects the Governor-General is the Queen's representative, and exercises various constitutional powers in her name, they are also independently vested with many important constitutional powers by the Constitution.
The Sovereign of Australia is currently Queen Elizabeth II. She is also the Sovereign of fifteen other Commonwealth Realms including the United Kingdom. Like the other Dominions, Australia gained legislative independence from the Parliament of the United Kingdom through the Statute of Westminster 1931. This came into force in Australia in 1942, but back dated to 3 September 1939. With the Royal Style and Titles Act 1953, the Australian Parliament gave the Queen the title Queen of Australia. In 1973 her Australian title no longer included her status as Queen of the United Kingdom and Defender of the Faith.
Section 61 of the Constitution says that 'The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor‑General as the Queen’s representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth'. Section 2 of the Australian Constitution says that a Governor-General shall represent the Queen in Australia. In practice, the Governor-General carries out all the tasks usually done by a head of state, without asking the Queen.
The question of whether the Queen is Australia's head of state became a political one during the 1999 Australian republic referendum, when opponents of the move to make Australia a republic claimed that Australia already had an Australian as head of state in the person of the Governor-General, who since 1965 has invariably been an Australian citizen. The former Governor-General, Major General Michael Jeffery, said in 2004: "Her Majesty is Australia's head of state but I am her representative and to all intents and purposes I carry out the full role." However, in 2005, he declined to name the Queen as head of state, instead saying in response to a direct question, "The Queen is the Monarch and I represent her, and I carry out all the functions of head of state." The Governor-General represents Australia internationally, making and receiving State visits.
In 2009 Prime Minister Kevin Rudd called the Governor-General the Australian head of state. He said an overseas visit by Quentin Bryce "...to Africa of this scale by Australia's Head of State will express the seriousness of Australia's commitment".
Under the Westminster system the Governor-General's powers are almost always used on the advice of the Prime Minister or other ministers. The Governor-General retains reserve powers similar to those possessed by the Queen in the United Kingdom. These are rarely exercised, but during the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975 Governor-General Sir John Kerr used them independently of the Queen and the Prime Minister.
Several times people in Australia have wanted to remove the monarchy. In a 1999 referendum, the Australian people voted on a proposal to change the Constitution. The proposal would have removed the Queen from the Constitution and replaced the Governor-General with a President nominated by the Prime Minister, but needing the approval of a two-thirds majority of both Houses of the Parliament. The proposal was defeated. The Australian Republican Movement continues to call for an end to the monarchy in Australia, opposed by Australians for Constitutional Monarchy.
The Federal Executive Council consists of the Governor-General, the Prime Minister and Ministers. It is a formal body which exists to give legal effect to decisions made by the Cabinet, and to carry out various other functions. Members of the Executive Council are entitled to be styled "The Honourable", a title which they retain for life. The Governor-General usually presides at Council meetings, but a Minister with the title Vice-President of the Executive Council serves as the link between the government and the Council.
The Constitution of Australia does not mention the Cabinet, and its decisions have no legal force. All members of the ministry must be sworn as members of the Federal Executive Council. This council is chaired by the Governor-General and which meets solely to approve and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet. That is why there is always a member of the ministry holding the title Vice-President of the Executive Council.
Until 1956 all members of the ministry were members of the Cabinet. With more ministers added in the 1940s and 1950s this made the cabinet too big. In 1956 Robert Menzies created a two level ministry, with only senior ministers in the Cabinet. These are known as the front bench because the sit on the front bench seats in the Parliament. This practice has been continued by all governments except the Whitlam Government.
When the non-Labor parties have been in power, the Prime Minister has made all Cabinet and ministerial appointments. When the Liberal Party and its predecessors (the Nationalist Party and the United Australia Party) have been in coalition with the National Party or its predecessor the Country Party, the leader of the junior Coalition party has had the right decide his party's members of the Coalition ministry, and to work with the Prime Minister to give them their responsibilities.
When the Labor first held office under Chris Watson, Watson used the right to choose members of his Cabinet. In 1907, however, the party decided that future Labor Cabinets would be elected by the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party, the Caucus. The Prime Minister would allocate their responsibilities. The Labor Prime Ministers had a lot of influence over who was elected to Labor ministries, although the leaders small groups inside the party also had a lot of power. Prior to the 2007 general election, Kevin Rudd, said that he and he alone would choose the ministry if he become Prime Minister. His party won the election and he chose the ministry, as he said he would.
The cabinet meets not only in Canberra but also in other Australian state capitals, most often Sydney and Melbourne. Kevin Rudd said he wanted the Cabinet to meet in other places, such as major regional cities. The Commonwealth Parliament Offices in Sydney are located in Phillip Street.
There are times when the government acts in a "caretaker" capacity, principally in the period prior to and immediately following a general election.
The Judiciary interprets the laws, using as a basis the laws as enacted and what was said in the Legislature while the laws were being passed.
 Before 1931, the junior status of dominions was shown in the fact that it was British ministers who advised the King, with dominion ministers, if they met the King at all, escorted by the constitutionally superior British minister. After 1931 all dominion ministers met the King as "His" ministers as of right, equal in Commonwealth status to Britain's ministers, meaning that there was no longer either a requirement for, or an acceptance of, the presence of British ministers. The first state to exercise this both symbolic and real independence was the Irish Free State. Australia and other dominions soon followed.

Met Office

The Met Office (now the official name for the Meteorological Office) is the United Kingdom's national weather service.
More than 50% of its revenue comes from goods and services. This is why it is a 'trading fund' of the Ministry of Defence.
Part of the Met Office headquarters at Exeter in Devon is the Met Office College. This does the training for internal personnel and many forecasters from around the world.
One of the British stalwarts, the Shipping Forecast, is produced by the Met Office and broadcast on BBC Radio 4. The Shipping Forecast has long been vital to the safety of mariners on the seas around the British Isles.
The Met Office is responsible for issuing Severe Weather Warnings for the United Kingdom through the National Severe Weather Warning Service (NSWWS). These warn of weather which may affect transport and lives. In March 2008, the system was improved and a new stage of warning was introduced, the 'Advisory'.
Its main role is to produce forecast models. It gathers information from weather satellites in space and observations on earth. The information is fed into two IBM supercomputers. The computers use models based on a software package known as the Unified Model. The principal weather products for UK customers are 36-hour forecasts from the newly operational 1.5 km resolution UKV model covering the UK and surroundings (replacing the 4 km model); 48-hour forecasts from the 12 km resolution NAE model covering Europe and the North Atlantic; and 144-hour forecasts from the 25 km resolution global model (replacing the 40 km global model). A wide range of other products for other regions of the globe are sold to customers abroad. They are used by MOD operations abroad or provided free to developing countries in Africa. If necessary, forecasters may make adjustments to the computer forecasts.

<doc id="264838" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264838" title="Statistical process control">
Statistical process control

Statistical process control (SPC) is the use of statistical methods to assess the stability of a process and the quality of its outputs. For example, consider a bottling plant. The entire system of production that produces filled bottles is termed a "process". Suppose the weight of liquid content added to a bottle is critical for cost control and customer satisfaction. The content should weigh 250 grams, but it is acceptable if the actual weight is between 245 and 255 grams. "Monitoring" means that the weight of every bottle is measured and recorded; sampling means that only a few bottles (say one in a thousand) are actually weighed (analysis to determine the rate of sampling and to assess sample representativeness is a well-established part of SPC.)
SPC relies on quantitative and graphic analysis of measurements to evaluate observed variation. If the attributes of interest (content weight in this example) vary within an acceptable range, a process is said to be "in control," "in statistical control," or "stable." When unacceptable variation is noted, actions are typically taken to determine and correct their cause. In the bottling example, suppose too many bottles are filled with less than 245 grams. Checking the plant equipment reveals that one of ten filler valves is malfunctioning.
SPC has had broad application in manufacturing since its introduction in the 1920s and in many other kinds of repetitive activities.
Much of the power of SPC lies in the ability to examine a process, for the sources of variation in that process, by using tools which give weight to objective analysis over subjective opinions and which allow the strength of each source to be determined numerically. Variations in the process, which might affect the quality of the end-product or service can be detected and corrected, thus reducing waste as well as the likelihood that problems will be passed on to the customer. With its emphasis on early detection and prevention of problems, SPC has a distinct advantage over other quality methods, such as inspection, which apply resources to detecting and correcting problems after they have occurred.
In addition to reducing waste, SPC can lead to a reduction in the time required to produce the product or service from end-to-end. This is partially due to a reduced likelihood that the final product will have to be reworked, but it may also result from using SPC data to identify bottlenecks, wait times, and other sources of delays within the process. Process cycle time reductions, coupled with improvements in yield, have made SPC a valuable tool from both a cost-reduction and a customer-satisfaction standpoint.
Statistical process control was pioneered by Walter A. Shewhart in the early 1920s. Shewhart created the basis for the control chart and the concept of a state of "statistical control" by carefully designed experiments. While Dr. Shewhart drew from pure mathematical statistical theories, he understood that data from physical processes seldom produces a "normal distribution curve" (a Gaussian distribution, also commonly referred to as a "bell curve"). He discovered how the observed variation in manufacturing data did not always behave the same way as data in nature (for example, Brownian motion of particles). Dr. Shewhart concluded that while every process displays variation, some processes display controlled variation that is natural to the process (common causes of variation), while others display uncontrolled variation that is not present in the process causal system at all times (special causes of variation). Uncontrolled variation is often associated with defective products, providing a data-driven means to identify problems and improve quality.
W. Edwards Deming later applied SPC methods in the U.S. during World War II, thereby successfully improving quality in the manufacture of munitions and other strategically important products. After the war ended, he was instrumental in introducing SPC methods to Japanese industry. Deming's approach of using SPC with related management practices came to be known as a quality management system.
The following description relates to manufacturing rather than to the service industry, although the principles of SPC can be successfully applied to either. For a description and example of how SPC applies to a service environment, refer to Roberts (2005). Selden describes how to use SPC in the fields of sales, marketing, and customer service, using Deming's famous Red Bead Experiment as an easy to follow demonstration.
In mass-manufacturing, the quality of the finished article was traditionally achieved through post-manufacturing inspection of the product; accepting or rejecting each article (or samples from a production lot) based on how well it met its design specifications. In contrast, Statistical Process Control uses statistical tools to observe the performance of the production process in order to predict significant deviations that may later result in rejected product.
Two kinds of variation occur in all manufacturing processes: both these types of process variation cause subsequent variation in the final product. The first is known as natural or common cause variation and consists of the variation inherent in the process as it is designed. Common cause variation may include variations in temperature, properties of raw materials, strength of an electrical current etc. The second kind of variation is known as special cause variation, or assignable-cause variation, and happens less frequently than the first. With sufficient investigation, a specific cause, such as abnormal raw material or incorrect set-up parameters, can be found for special cause variations.
For example, a breakfast cereal packaging line may be designed to fill each cereal box with 500 grams of product, but some boxes will have slightly more than 500 grams, and some will have slightly less, in accordance with a distribution of net weights. If the production process, its inputs, or its environment changes (for example, the machines doing the manufacture begin to wear) this distribution can change. For example, as its cams and pulleys wear out, the cereal filling machine may start putting more cereal into each box than specified. If this change is allowed to continue unchecked, more and more product will be produced that fall outside the tolerances of the manufacturer or consumer, resulting in waste. While in this case, the waste is in the form of "free" product for the consumer, typically waste consists of rework or scrap.
By observing at the right time what happened in the process that led to a change, the quality engineer or any member of the team responsible for the production line can troubleshoot the root cause of the variation that has crept in to the process and correct the problem.
SPC indicates when an action should be taken in a process, but it also indicates when NO action should be taken. An example is a person who would like to maintain a constant body weight and takes weight measurements weekly. A person who does not understand SPC concepts might start dieting every time his or her weight increased, or eat more every time his or her weight decreased. This type of action could be harmful and possibly generate even more variation in body weight. SPC would account for normal weight variation and better indicate when the person is in fact gaining or losing weight.
Statistical Process Control may be broadly broken down into three sets of activities: understanding the process; understanding the causes of variation; and elimination of the sources of special cause variation. Key tools in SPC are control charts, a focus on continuous improvement and designed experiments.
In understanding a process, the process is typically mapped out and the process is monitored using control charts. Control charts are used to identify variation that may be due to special causes, and to free the user from concern over variation due to common causes. This is a continuous, ongoing activity. When a process is stable and does not trigger any of the detection rules for a control chart, a process-capability analysis may also be performed to predict the ability of the current process to produce conforming (i.e. within specification) product in the future.
When excessive variation is identified by the control-chart detection rules, or the process capability is found lacking, additional effort is exerted to determine causes of that variance. The tools used include Ishikawa diagrams, designed experiments and Pareto charts. Designed experiments are critical to this phase of SPC, as they are the only means of objectively quantifying the relative importance of the many potential causes of variation.
Once the causes of variation have been quantified, effort is spent in eliminating those causes that are both statistically and practically significant (i.e. a cause that has only a small but statistically significant effect may not be considered cost-effective to fix; however, a cause that is not statistically significant can never be considered practically significant). Generally, this includes development of standard work, error-proofing and training. Additional process changes may be required to reduce variation or align the process with the desired target, especially if there is a problem with process capability.
In 1989, the Software Engineering Institute introduced the notion that SPC can be usefully applied to non-manufacturing processes, such as software-engineering processes, in the Capability Maturity Model (CMM). This idea exists today within the Level 4 and Level 5 practices of the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI). However, this notion that SPC is a useful tool when applied to non-repetitive, knowledge-intensive processes, such as engineering processes, has encountered much skepticism, and remains controversial today. The problem lies in numerous areas of software which are not repetitive, but instead are one-time or one-off aspects of quality, rather than being observed for repeated performance over a long-term view.

Consultant

A consultant (from the Latin "consultare" meaning "to discuss" also the basis of words such as "consul" and "counsel") is a professional who provides expert advice in a particular area of expertise. Various consultants offer advice in management, accountancy, the environment, entertainment, technology, law (tax law, in particular), human resources, marketing, emergency management, food production, medicine, finance, statistics, software, life management, economics, public affairs, communication, engineering, sound system design, graphic design, or waste management.
A consultant is usually an expert or a professional, in a specific field, who also has a wide knowledge of the subject matter. A consultant usually works for a consultancy firm or is self-employed, and engages with multiple and changing clients. Thus, clients have access to deeper levels of expertise than would be feasible for them to retain in-house, and may purchase only as much service from the outside consultant as desired.
'Consultant' is also the term used to denote the most senior medical position in the United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland (e.g., a consultant surgeon).
Some consultants are employed by a consult staffing company, a company that provides consultants to clients. This is particularly common in the technology sector. Consultants are often called contractors in the technology sector in reference to their employment contract.
Strategy consultants are common in upper management in many industries. There are also independent consultants who act as interim executives with decision-making power under corporate policies or statutes. They may sit on specially constituted boards or committees.
Consultants work at client places on behalf of a consultancy or Billing company.

Carnarvon, Western Australia

Carnarvon is a coastal town about 900 kilometres north of Perth, Western Australia. It is at the mouth of the Gascoyne River on the Indian Ocean. The popular Shark Bay World Heritage Site lies to the south of the town. In 2006, there were 5,283 people living in Carnarvon.
The town began in 1883, as a port and supply centre for the surrounding region. It is the administrative centre for the Shire of Carnarvon, the town site was officially listed on 4 June 1891. It was named after Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies.
Carnarvon has had three tramways.
Carnarvon has a warm to hot dry climate. Average yearly rainfall is with the rainiest months being in May and June. Occasionally tropical cyclones will influence Carnarvon and bring very heavy rain, high temperatures and strong winds. Apart from possible cyclones, summers are usually dry. Temperatures range from an average maximum of in February to in July. Average minimums are and respectively.
Main industries of the area include:
During the 1960s, NASA set up the Carnarvon Tracking Station to support the Gemini and Apollo space program. The tracking station was closed in the mid 1970s. Only the foundations of this historical site remain.
Radio Australia had a shortwave relay station (built during the 1970s) that used to relay programming to Europe, South Asia and South East Asia.
There are five schools in the town, three government-run and two independent. These schools are: St Mary's Star of the Sea Catholic School which was built in 1906, Carnarvon Senior High School, East Carnarvon Primary School, Carnarvon Primary School, Carnarvon Christian School and Carnarvon School of the Air.
In 1964 and 1965, 12 rockets were launched from Carnarvon to a maximum altitude of .
On 20 May 1988, the bulk carrier "Korean Star" ran aground in bad weather near Cape Cuvier, within the port limits of Carnarvon. Around 600 tonnes of fuel oil were spilled into the ocean. Damage was limited to of remote beaches and coastline. The ship was left grounded, however very little of the wreck remains to be seen.

<doc id="264856" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264856" title="Postcodes in Australia">
Postcodes in Australia

Postcodes are used in Australia to sort and send mail to the correct address. All postcodes in Australia have four numbers and are placed at the end of the address. Australian postcodes are managed by Australia Post.
Postcodes are published in small books which can be collected from your nearest post offices, or online at the Australia Post website.
On envelopes and postcards there are often four square boxes printed in orange ink at the bottom right for the postcode numbers. These are used when addressing mail by hand.
Postcodes were started in Australia in 1967 by the Postmaster-General's Department (PMG), now called Australia Post. They replaced earlier postal sorting systems, such as Melbourne's letter and number codes (e.g., "N3", "E5") and a similar system once used in rural and regional New South Wales.
Australian Postcodes are four numbers, and written after the name of the city, suburb, or town, and the state or territory:
When writing an address by hand, a row of four boxes (pre-printed on the lower right hand corner of many envelopes) is usually used.
Australian postcodes are sorting information. They are often linked with one area (e.g. 6160 belongs only to Fremantle, Western Australia). But sometimes they can be quite complex, especially in country areas (e.g. 2570 belongs to twenty-two towns and suburbs around Camden, New South Wales). The south-western Victoria 3221 postcode of the Geelong Mail Centre also includes twenty places around Geelong with very few people. This means that mail for these places is not fully sorted until it gets to Geelong. Some postcodes cover large populations (e.g., postcode 4350 serving some 100,000 people in the City of Toowoomba), while other postcodes have much smaller populations, even in urban areas. The postcode numbers range from as low as 0200 (for the Australian National University) to 9729 (mail addressed to the Gold Coast City Council).
Some towns and suburbs have two postcodes—one for street deliveries and one for [post office box]es. For instance, a street address in the Sydney suburb of Parramatta would be written like this:
But mail sent to a PO Box in Parramatta would be addressed:
Many big businesses, government departments and other institutions receive large volumes of mail. They can have their own postcode as a Large Volume Receiver ("LVR"), e.g. the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital has the postcode 4029. More postcode ranges were made available for LVRs in the 1990s.
The first one or two numbers usually show the state or territory that the postcode belongs to
Sometimes near the state and territory borders, Australia Post finds it easier to send mail through a nearby post office that is across the border:
These are postcodes that does not follow the above rule. 
Some or all of the postcodes above may cover two states. For example postcode 2620 covers both a suburb in NSW ("Gundaroo") as well as a suburb in the ACT ("Hume") - the postcode is within the ACT range.
Jervis Bay Territory, once an exclave of the ACT but now a separate territory, is geographically located on the coast of NSW. It is just south of the towns of Vincentia and Huskisson, with which it shares a postcode. Mail to the Jervis Bay Territory is still addressed to the ACT.
The numbers used to show the state on each radio callsign in Australia is the same number as the first number for postcodes in that state, e.g. "2xx" in New South Wales, "3xx" in Victoria, etc. Radio callsigns pre-date postcodes in Australia by more than forty years.
Australia's external territories are also included in Australia Post's postcode system. While these territories do not belong to any state, they are addressed as such for mail sorting:
Three scientific bases in Antarctica operated by the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions share a postcode with the isolated sub-Antarctic island of Macquarie Island (part of Tasmania):
Each state's capital city ends with three zeroes, while territorial capital cities end with two zeroes. Capital city postcodes were the lowest postcodes in their state or territory range, before new ranges for LVRs and PO Boxes were made available. The last number can usually be changed from "0" to "1" to get the postcode for General Post Office boxes in any capital city (though Perth now uses a different range of postcodes for its GPO Boxes):
While the first number of a postcode usually shows the state or territory, the second number usually shows a region within the state. However, postcodes with the same second number are not always next to each othera. As an example, postcodes in the range 2200–0001 are split between the southern suburbs of Sydney and the Central Coast of New South Wales.
Postcodes with a second number of "0" or "1" are almost always located within the metropolitan area of the state's capital city. Postcodes with higher second numbers are usually located in rural and regional areas. Common exceptions are where towns were rural when postcodes were first introduced in 1967, but have since been suburbanised and incorporated into metropolitan areas, e.g. Penrith, New South Wales has the postcode 2750 and Petrie, Queensland has the postcode 4502.
Within each region with the same second number, postcodes usually get bigger the further one travels from the state's capital city along major highways and railways. For instance, heading north on the North Coast railway in New South Wales away from Sydney:
Major towns and cities tend to have "0" as the last number or last two numbers, e.g. Rockhampton, Queensland has the postcode 4700 and Ballarat, Victoria has the postcode 3350. There are exceptions; the major town of Ipswich, Queensland has the postcode 4305, while Goodna, a relatively unimportant suburb of Ipswich, is allocated 4300.
Post Office Preferred envelopes sold in Australia have four boxes in the bottom right corner of the front of the envelope. These boxes or squares, which by Australia Post calls "postcode squares", have the postcode for hand-addressed mail. This is for the purpose of Australia Post's automated mail-sorting equipment, which uses optical character recognition software. Postcode squares were introduced in 1990.
Australia Post says that postcode squares should not be used for machine-addressed mail, or mail going overseas.
Many other organisations now use postcodes. Insurance companies often use postcodes when working out the cost of car and house insurance. The NSW Ministry of Transport uses postcodes to give specific numbers for each bus stop in Greater Sydney. The stop number is five to seven numbers: the first four are the postcode, and the others show the bus stop (sometimes written with a space in between, e.g. "2000 108"). Many companies that produce metropolitan street maps also list the postcodes for each suburb, both in indexes on the maps themselves.
To improve mechanised sorting, each address now has a sorting number which is printed on the letter as an orange coloured barcode. This number might be 12 numbers long. This system enables the post office to place items in delivery order.

Statistician

A statistician is someone who works with theoretical or applied statistics. The profession exists in both the private and public sectors. The core of that work is to measure, interpret, and describe some events in the world and spot patterns within them. The field shares much common history with social science, but often with a greater view on complex mathematical methods. Statisticians commonly have higher college degrees or other credentials as proof that they are qualified for the job.
It is common to combine statistical knowledge with expertise in other subjects. The applications are varied. Statisticians apply their knowledge to production, research, finance, medicine, insurance, census-taking, government, etc. They often are employed to support managerial decisions or to supervise quality control in manufacturing. 
According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2008, there were 22,600 jobs listed as "statistician" in the United States. Of these people, approximately 30% worked for governments (federal, state, or local). Additionally, there are substantial numbers of persons who use statistics in their work but have job titles other than "statistician". The job of statistician is considered a profession. Most statisticians work in offices and have regular working hours and can therefore be considered to be white-collar workers. A lower number of statisticians are self-employed as statistical consultants.
Most employment as a statistician requires a minimum of a masters degree in statistics or a related field. Many professional statisticians have a PhD.
Civilizations have used the work of statisticians for thousands of years. Statistics was employed in ancient Egypt in censuses of population and cattle. Typical work might involve developing a model and sampling plans, analyzing survey results, or making agricultural or econometric forecasts.

Kung Fu Panda 2

Kung Fu Panda 2 is a 2011 3D American computer-animated action comedy movie and the 2nd installment in the series. A successful sequel to "Kung Fu Panda", Jack Black is back voicing Po again. In the movie Po is now the Dragon Warrior, and is fighting with his fellow kung fu masters, the Furious Five: Tigress, Viper, Monkey, Mantis, and Crane. They go on a quest in Gong-men City to banish Lord Shen, an evil albino peacock from using a weapon to destroy kung fu. The film is directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson, who previously worked as a storyboard artist in "Kung Fu Panda 1". It received critical acclaim and is the highest-grossing movie to be directed by a woman.
Po (voiced by Jack Black) is now the Dragon Warrior and a Kung Fu master protecting the Valley of Peace together with his friends, the Furious Five, but must now find inner peace. Master Shifu (voiced by Dustin Hoffman) then sends him on a journey with the Furious Five to Gongmen City and stop Lord Shen (voiced by Gary Oldman), an evil albino peacock who has made a new weapon that can stop Kung Fu. Po has trouble on his journey because he's worried about what happened to his real parents. An old soothsayer (voiced by Michelle Yeoh) helps Po remember that his parents sent Po away as a baby to protect him when their village was attacked by Lord Shen many years ago because Shen learned he would be defeated by Po, the foretold warrior of black and white. Now knowing where he came from, Po finds inner peace, destroys Shen's cannons by throwing the cannonballs back at them, defeats Shen (who also gets killed and crushed by his own cannon), and accepts Mr. Ping (voiced by James Hong) as his dad.
"Kung Fu Panda 2" was acclaimed by critics. It holds a rating of 85% in Rotten Tomatoes and a rating of 7 out of 10. The consensus is "the story arc may seen a tad familiar to fans of the original, but "Kung Fu Panda 2" offers enough action, comedy and visual sparkle to compensate". Just like in the original film, the animation, voice acting and character development were praised.
The film became a box office success. It grossed $667,692,281 on a $150 million budget. It is the highest grossing animated film of 2011, the 9th highest grossing animated film ever released, the 53rd highest-grossing film of all time and the 6th highest grossing film of 2011. It is also the highest grossing animated film directed by a woman (Jennifer Yuh Nelson).
Kung Fu Panda 2 is the soundtrack of the film of the same, scored by Hans Zimmer and John Powell and released in May 24, 2011. Just like the movie, the soundtrack received positive reviews from music critics.
After the success of "Kung Fu Panda 2", DreamWorks Animation confirmed that there will be 6 movies in the franchise. "Kung Fu Panda 3" is confirmed to be released in 2016, with Jennifer Yuh Nelson returning to direct and Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger returning to write the script. The original cast will return in the movie, and "Kung Fu Panda 3" will be the first American animated movie to ever be co-produced by a Chinese firm.

Stanford prison experiment

The Stanford prison experiment was a scientific experiment done at Stanford University in 1971. The experiment was done in the field of psychology. It tried to re-create the conditions at a prison. Philip Zimbardo was the psychologist who led the experiment. Twenty-four undergraduate students were selected to play the role of either prisoner or prison guard. The role was assigned at random. The students adapted to the roles beyond what Zimbardo had imagined. After some time, the guards used authoritarian measures. 
The experiment even affected Zimbardo himself. Five of the prisoners were upset enough by the process to quit the experiment early. The experiment was abruptly stopped after only six days, out of fifteen planned. The experimental process and the results remain controversial. The entire experiment was filmed. Parts of the footage were soon made publicly available as a film. Over 30 years later, Zimbardo found new interest in the experiment when the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal occurred. 
The experiment also had certain problems:

Wikipedia:Thinking outside the infobox

The phrase "Thinking outside the infobox" has many possible meanings, as with the underlying phrase ("Thinking outside the box"). It is very easy to code a small infobox outside, and below, as an extension of a formal template-infobox. Also, the structure of an infobox has implications, outside the Simple English Wikipedia, for the other-language Wikipedias.
The use of infoboxes in Wikipedia articles has both advantages and disadvantages. While an infobox can provide a condensed summary of related data, it can also "over-simplify" the connections, such as when a territory, named in an infobox, changes boundaries but is treated as being exactly the same place. However, there are other issues to consider:
Generally, a separate Wikipedia template page is created to store the layout of an infobox. However, when first creating a new infobox, it might be preferable to keep the infobox as hard-coded within the same article, to allow changing the infobox along with the article text for quick edit-preview. Also, if the infobox is of limited scope, there is no need to expand pages by adding a separate infobox page, infobox-talk, and infobox-history pages.
A short infobox can be coded as follows (as of 6 July 2010):
If a standardized infobox-template does not contain enough data fields, just create a follow-on infobox after the template (using the coding method as shown above).
The simplest possible infobox has just "class=infobox" (box appears at right):
Note that the first line of text must begin with the vertical-bar ("|"), although it can be indented as a bar further along the line. 
The width can be set, width=200px. Each row is added by "|-" plus a line of column text (using the double-bar "||" to separate columns on one line):
Notice that the title "I am..." will not be centered, unless the 2 columns are spanned (by using the column prefix "|colspan=2 align=center|" enclosed in vertical-bars).
When a data item is too long to fit into a standardized infobox, consider appending a simple infobox for longer notes:
codice_1
<br>
For any item too wide, or too wordy, to fit in a standard infobox, just place "(see notebox below)" as the connection to the custom-coded notebox infobox.
Also, notice setting the background-color as gray/grey by use of the HTML CSS custom style directive (style="background:#DDDDDD") placed before the "Notebox:" text.
Rather than fear the coding of infobox details, more writers should learn how infoboxes are coded, to more easily expand, or correct, the details of various infoboxes.
Users should learn how to create infoboxes, on the fly, and learn how to spot/correct problems in infobox format. It is not necessary to code every infobox into a separate template page, outside the article. Some infoboxes should be coded inside an article. General reminders:
It is always important to think "outside the infobox", as to the effect it has "outside the Simple English Wikipedia", in the many other-language Wikipedia articles. That viewpoint can focus the choice of wording, and the amount of complexity, to be used when developing infoboxes.
However, don't overuse infoboxes, when the details are better explained outside the infobox, in the other text on a page.

Wikipedia:Authors of Wikipedia

This essay, WP:Authors of Wikipedia (or "Who writes this stuff" ) describes how articles are made.
Some parts of Wikipedia have been copied from very old encyclopedias. However, for the majority of articles, Wikipedia has become a vast "pot-luck dinner". The articles are, mostly, a somewhat random collection of information that many people thought to be worthy of interest. One of the most difficult aspects, for many people to realize, is that Wikipedia is basically "invented out of thin air" and people have retro-forced some rules with little regard to actually working with other people. For those reasons, some Wikipedia articles may seem quite bizarre, and several so-called "official" guidelines are still demanding peculiar rules, years later, with some rules so wiki-spastic they have never been considered in any other multi-user site. The problem is so severe that there is even a policy, "" (WP:IAR), because many rules might no longer reflect what normal people would willingly follow. What seemed to be a reasonable format limitation, years ago, might no longer apply. Also, as more thousands of users have joined, it has become increasingly difficult to check the quality of new articles, and hence, many partial stubs with misspelled words have been created.
Several portions of Wikipedia were created as articles copied from traditional encyclopedias, such as from the 1911 "Encyclopaedia Britannica", or generated from a long list of town population-data, but those articles now represent, at most, maybe 10% of the current article base. The remaining bulk of Wikipedia contains random articles, added as each subject arises.
As with a pot-luck dinner, each individual brings something to the table, so most articles tend to be a one-person contribution. Many articles are written by each person acting alone, with each article later modified slightly by perhaps 10 other people, but essentially the viewpoint of one person. After an article has stayed a while (after several months), it might be radically expanded by another person, adding perhaps 30%-50% more information. However, oftentimes, a "2-year expansion" is made by the original author, almost doubling the size of an article. Only a fraction of the total articles have been significantly expanded by multiple people. Because there are tens of millions of notable subjects in the world, each person can write new articles each week, without always needing to expand some other, older article. In early 2010, Wikipedia was growing at the rate of over 1,040 new articles, "every day" (see: ), beyond the sub-standard articles deleted every day.
Overall, Wikipedia users are divided into 2 groups of editors: the registered users, and the unregistered IP addresses. The number of registered users, with login names, is (roughly million people), with a similar number of unregistered users. However, many of the registered users sometimes edit articles without logging in with their username, instead, just using their IP address. So, the total number of individual people, who edit Wikipedia, is less than . But some statistics have estimated the active editors, during a month, to be less than 300,000 people actively editing articles.
Small groups of editors often band together in s, to edit articles that share a common theme or topic. Each Wikiproject develops its own rules, and many such groups have struggled to keep going, due to the limited time that the various volunteers can spend in editing so many articles.
Because of the haphazard interest in subjects, some famous book, such as "Gone with the Wind", might go 7 years with only a hollow article about the book, while a particular comic book might be described in numerous articles, detailing each volume/issue published in the set of comics. The book/movie "The Da Vinci Code" was expanded into more than 12 articles about that single subject. Many articles about sports teams have been expanded into entire article-sets, with separate articles for each member of the team or coaching staff, or for each play-off season.
However, after a few years, the coverage of many subjects tends to broaden, so now, there are related subarticles, such as "Scarlett O'Hara" or "Rhett Butler" (or other characters in Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel).
After several months, many articles tend to be hacked or adjusted, multiple times, in ways contrary to the original writing style, or in ways that introduce many errors. Such long-term, multi-hacking of articles is known as "wiki-rot". Some phrases might have been changed or inserted (or duplicated in later paragraphs), and with even just a few "bad-apple" changes, an article can seem chaotic or trashy. In prior years, many people set their personal Wikipedia-watchlists to receive update-alerts when articles had been hacked or changed, so the updates could be fixed or adjusted soon after. However, in general, it is a good idea to re-visit older articles, every few months, to check for quality problems that have been added. It is not critical to make instant improvements, because many readers have come to expect rampant vandalism in numerous articles. Hence, articles should be fixed only as time permits, not in a frantic rush to reach encyclopedic "perfection".
Typically, deletion of whole sections, of an article, is considered to be "blanking" (as a form of vandalism). However, such blanking is done, often, and sometimes justified as removing "POV" (slanted point-of-view) text from the article, while effectively axing entire sections. The fundamental problem with justifying deletion, such as by claiming , is that very few Wikipedia policies actually condone such deletions. Even the most crucial problems, such as avoiding potentially private, or libelous, text about a living person, should be handled by mending or modifying, not deleting, the inserted text, per policy since 2007, as noted in essay . When detecting excessive text removals, feel free to revert any self-righteous deletions, and try to restore text as intended by the writers, but always mindful of discussions on the talk-page. Some of the most severe blanking, in recent articles, has involved removing the related-illness text in some medical articles, perhaps because that text contained "too many technical medical terms" that were actually, the formal names (and wiki-linked) for the related diseases. A full article, possibly expanded by a nurse or medical student, was hacked to become a partial stub, removing all the related information typically found in a medical encyclopedia: a real hatchet job, but not caught until weeks/months later. Expect such rampant deletions and be prepared to reverse them.

Wikipedia:Accepting other users

This essay is about working with other users, and methods to cope with the stress of handling difficult situations. It is important to try to accept other users and reduce tensions that cannot be avoided entirely. As with the years required to receive an advanced degree, it might take some users a few years to reach the same levels of civilized behavior. Try to be more patient, and perhaps consider how a person might act next year.
In 2010, English Wikipedia had over 13 million registered users. At the same time, there were more than 145,000 users on Simple English Wikipedia (currently, that number is ). It also hosts almost as many anonymous users who choose to change pages without logging in. People trying to write articles can face opposition, or get help, from many different people. Other websites, may have restricted the membership to people with the same opinions, or to those showing a serious interest. Wikipedia, however, has almost no restrictions for user access. In a sense, Wikipedia is a big social experiment (though not officially) which asks the question: "What if everyone had to work together, without shooting each other or putting people in prison?" For over 10 years, Wikipedia has presented an open environment where, every week, thousands of people try to work together to write and review articles. It is an environment that most people have probably never seen before, and they would never be expected, anywhere else, to work so closely with that many thousands of unscreened people.
Typically, people tend to assume that others think or feel the same way that they do. However, with Wikipedia, the exact opposite might be the case. In a tragedy, sadness is often be expected, but some might see destruction as a cause for extreme joy. Always expect the unexpected:
An analogy that might be helpful, to consider, is the way pets behave when meeting others: a dog is very likely to growl and bark at someone they have never met, yet become extremely friendly and cooperative several months later. Same dog - totally different behavior.
Abandoned children, raised in isolation, do not magically become "well-groomed" gentlemen of polite society. It is unreasonable to think that people raised in fascist countries, or with domineering parents, would instinctively react with polite consideration, and request, "Well, I'd like to know your opinion, so we can develop a common viewpoint". After working with thousands of Wikipedia users, I have never met someone with such a mellow mindset. Consider some related analogies:
Be prepared to face people with radically different backgrounds and limited amounts of education. It is not always easy to get others to sort out the priorities. Few would be visionaries.
Many times, when troubles arise, each person has a choice, as to whether they could just drop the matter, and simply move on to something else. The first option is to back away from the trouble (see essay: "" ). However, sometimes, there is a need to resolve a conflict and try to forge some type of compromise to reach a true consensus, despite the difficulties involved. There is a famous quote, "Hell is other people". Although many people are often very cooperative, there are limits, and when facing a massive confrontation, the situation can seem hopelessly deadlocked. It is important to find ways to accept the other users, and try to resolve the conflicts, to some extent. However, if several people are against you, it is best to move on to other articles. Wikipedia has almost no way to stop groups of people who are all POV-pushing some viewpoint. Even on the English Wikipedia, formal can take months, and often, the subject of a controversy is not judged for real-world balance, but instead the people are topic-banned depending on who was tricked into becoming the most angry during debates.
There are many ways to alleviate the stress, caused when handling difficult situations. Some methods are:
Each person should seek what works best for them. And remember: some people can hold grudges for years, so beware making people even angrier.
If the frustrations and stress are not reduced, then anger can build to interfere with other events:
On balance, it would be preferable to merely accept, at some level, the actions of other users, and let go of any resentments, anger, or stress. Be willing to let others have the months, or years, they need to grow and learn how to cooperate in more civilized ways.

Alvin and the Chipmunks

Alvin and the Chipmunks is an American animated music group. It was created by Ross Bagdasarian, Sr. in 1958. The group is made up of three animated chipmunks who sing and talk. They are Alvin, Simon and Theodore. The trio is managed by a fictional man named Dave Seville, who adopted the chipmunks. In reality, "David Seville" was Bagdasarian's stage name, and the chipmunks themselves are named after the executives of their original record label. The characters became a success, and were recreated in animated cartoons and eventually movies.
The voices of the group were all done by Bagdasarian. He recorded his voice and then sped up the playback to create high-pitched voices. It was so unusual and well-done that it earned the record two Grammy Awards for musical engineering. Bagdasarian, performing as the Chipmunks, released a long series of albums and singles. Bagdasarian died in 1972. The characters were revived in the 1980s and 1990s, with the voices being performed by Ross Bagdasarian, Jr. and his wife Janice Karman.
A computer-animated movie based on the characters was released in 2007, called "Alvin and the Chipmunks". It had three sequels: , and . The actors Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney performed the talking voices of the Chipmunks. Bagdasarian, Jr. and Karman performed the singing voices for Alvin, Theodore and the Chipettes, but Steve Vining does Simon's singing voice. The project has earned five Grammy Awards, an American Music Award, a Golden Reel Award, and three Kids' Choice Awards, and has been nominated for three Emmy awards.

Super Aguri F1

Super Aguri F1 was a Formula One racing team that competed from to . The team was founded by former F1 driver Aguri Suzuki. They were based in Tokyo, Japan. They operated from the former Arrows factory in Leafield, UK. The cars were called Super Aguri-Honda because they used Honda engines. The team was, to some degree, an unofficial Honda second-team. In Japan, public pressure convinced Honda to help its former driver Takuma Sato to continue in Formula One. This lead to the start of Super Aguri F1, and the engine supply from Honda. The team competed two full years, and part of the third year. After four races in the season, the team withdrew due to financial problems.
The team started in September 2005. on 1 November 2005, the team told the FIA its wanted to enter the Formula One World Championship. The FIA did not approved Super Aguri's entry. It was reported that the team failed to give the required $48 million entry bond on time. Super Aguri applied for entry again in 2006. Because they missed the initial registration, the team needed the existing ten teams to agree to its entry. The other teams gave the required unanimous agreement. Super Aguri was confirmed by the FIA on 26 January 2006.
In 2006, the chassis, Super Aguri SA05, was based on the 2002 Arrows A23. The Arrows chassis was bought from ex-Minardi principal Paul Stoddart.Stoddart had bought them when the Arrows team went bankrupt. Super Aguri updated their old chassis to become the Super Aguri SA06. They were used from the German Grand Prix to the end of the year.
Takuma Sato and Yuji Ide were the initial race drivers for the team in the 2006 season. Franck Montagny as the third driver. On 4 May, after four races, the team announced that Montagny would be replacing Ide as race driver. Ide's Super Licence had been revoked after a clash with Christijan Albers.
For , Super Aguri announced Takuma Sato and Anthony Davidson would be driving for the team.
When the new SA07 car was first tested by the FIA, it failed the crash test. It was less than 48 hours before the first practice session for the Australian Grand Prix that the SA07 chassis was ready. At the Spanish Grand Prix the team scored its first point. Takuma Sato finished in 8th place. At the Canadian Grand Prix, the team scored its highest finish. Sato finishing in sixth place and earned three points.
For , Super Aguri kept their drivers Takuma Sato and Anthony Davidson following the acquisition of an unspecified portion of the team by the Magma Group became a part owner of the team. The team did not attend the final pre-season tests. Not all the parts had arrived. Magma canceled their proposed purchase, leaving Super Aguri's future in doubt. Super Aguri's equipment was denied entry to Istanbul Park for the Turkish Grand Prix. Honda Racing's CEO Nick Fry reportedly told the race organizers that Super Aguri would not be taking part. On 6 May 2008, team founder and principal Aguri Suzuki announced that they were withdrawing from the 2008 World Championship due to financial problems. He said the breach of contract by "SS United Group Oil & Gas Company" resulting in the loss of financial backing. The team was in financial difficulties.
A team of corporate recovery partners were appointed to seek a buyer for Super Aguri. The team's assets were bought by a German businessman named Franz Hilmer. Hilmer unsuccessfully to enter the season under the Brabham name.
 Team withdrew from championship after race 4. They did not field any drivers or cars in any further races that season.

Wikipedia:Notability (music)

This page shows how is used for music, including artists and bands, albums, and songs. Notability is different from "fame", "importance" or "popularity", although these may affect it.
Important note: If an article does not meet these notability guidelines, it is not a . Also, meeting these guidelines does not mean that an article must be kept. These are simply guidelines to help make that decision. However, an article on an artist or band that does not "show" notability can be quickly deleted under . A claim of notability, even if contested, may avoid quick deletion under A4. This would then need a full process to decide if the article should be included in Wikipedia.
In order to meet Wikipedia's standards for and , the article must actually show that the guidelines have been met. Evidence with references should be included.
These notability guidelines are only about the suitability of topics for articles. Other relevant policies which can affect an article include: 
A musician or group (this includes a "band", "singer", "rapper", "orchestra", "DJ", "musical theatre group", etc.) may be notable if it meets at least one of the following guidelines:
"Note that members of notable bands are redirected to the band's article, not given individual articles, unless they have shown individual notability for activity independent of the band, such as solo releases. Members of two notable bands are generally notable enough for their own article."
For composers, songwriters, librettists or lyricists:
"Where possible, composers or lyricists with not enough material to have a reasonably detailed article should be merged into the article about their work. When a composer or lyricist is known for multiple works, such a merger may not be possible."
For composers and performers outside mass media traditions:
All articles on albums, singles or songs must meet the basic criteria at the , with significant coverage in that are of the subject.
In general, if the musician or ensemble is notable, then their officially released albums may also have enough notability to have individual articles on Wikipedia. Unreleased material such as demos, mixtapes, bootlegs, and promo-only recordings do not in general have the significant independent coverage in reliable sources needed for independent notability. Album articles with little more than a track listing should be merged into the artist's main article or discography article, .
Most songs do not meet the guidelines for notability for their own article. These should redirect to another relevant article, such as for the songwriter, a notable album or for the artist who performed the song. 
Songs that have been ranked on national or significant music charts, that have won significant awards or honors or that have been independently released as a recording by several notable artists, bands or groups are probably notable. Notability aside, a separate article on a song should only exist when there is enough verifiable material to have a reasonably detailed article. Articles unlikely ever to grow beyond stubs should be merged to articles about an artist or album. 
Articles and information about albums with confirmed release dates in the near future must be confirmed by . Separate articles should "not" be created until there is enough reliably sourced information about a future release. For example, a future album whose article is titled "(Artist)'s Next Album" and consists solely of blog or fan forum speculation about "possible" titles, or songs that "might" be on the album, is a violation and should be discussed only in the artist's article, and even then only if there is some information about it. 
In a few special cases, an unreleased album "may" meet guidelines for an advance article if there is enough verifiable and properly referenced information about it—for example, Guns 'n Roses' 2008 album "Chinese Democracy" had an article as early as 2004. However, this only applies to a "very" small number of exceptionally high-profile projects—generally, an album should not have an independent article until its title, track listing and release date have "all" been publicly confirmed by the artist or their record label.
Concert tours are notable if they have received significant coverage in independent reliable sources. Such coverage might show notability in terms of artistic approach, financial success, relationship to audience, or other such terms. Sources which merely establish that a tour happened are "not" sufficient to show notability.
Good online sources for recordings are the Freedb search engine or the Allmusic search engine. To find ownership information on song texts copyrighted in the US, the ASCAP ACE Title Search and BMI Repertoire Search utilities are very useful. When looking in depth, a Google book search may turn something up. For material that has captured the attention of academics, a search on Google scholar may work.
An experienced editor also provides on ensuring that articles meet criteria.

<doc id="264936" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264936" title="Compromise">
Compromise

To compromise is to make a deal where one person gives up part of his or her demand. In arguments, "compromise" is a concept of finding agreement through communication, through a mutual acceptance of terms, while often involving variations from an original goal or desire. 
Extremism is often considered as antonym to compromise, which, depending on context, may be associated with concepts of balance or tolerance. In the negative connotation, compromise may be referred to as "capitulation", referring to a "surrender" of objectives, principles, or material, in the process of negotiating an agreement. In human relationships, "compromise" is frequently said to be an agreement that no party is happy with, this is because the parties involved often feel that they either gave away too much or that they received too little.
From cultural background and influences, the meaning and perception of the word "compromise" may be different: In the UK, Ireland and Commonwealth countries, the word "compromise" has a positive meaning (as a consent, an agreement where both parties win something); in the U.S., it can have rather negative connotations, as in "compromising principles" as a sell-out of basic beliefs.
Defining and finding the best possible compromise is an important problem in fields like game theory and the voting system.
Research has indicated that less-than-optimal compromises are often the result of negotiators failing to realize when they have interests that are completely compatible with those of the other party, and hence, they settle for suboptimal agreements. Mutually-better outcomes can often be found by careful study of both parties' interests, especially if done early in negotiations.

<doc id="264937" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264937" title="Visionary">
Visionary

Defined broadly, a visionary, is one who can envision the future. For some groups, this can involve the supernatural or use of mind-altering drugs.
A visionary state can be achieved via meditation, drugs, lucid dreams, daydreams, or art. One example is Hildegard of Bingen, a 12th century artist/visionary and Catholic saint. Other visionaries in religion are Mohammed (who had a vision of and communed with the Angel Gabriel), St. Bernadette (who had a vision of contact with the Blessed Virgin), and Joseph Smith (who had a vision of contact with the Angel Moroni).
A "vision" can be political, religious, environmental, social, or technological in nature. By extension, a "visionary" can also be a person with a clear, distinctive and specific (in some details) vision of the future, usually connected with advances in technology or social/political arrangements. For example, Ted Nelson or U.S. Vice President Al Gore is referred to as a visionary in connection with the Internet. 
Other visionaries simply imagine what does not yet exist but might some day, as some forms of "visioning" (or gazing) can provide a glimpse into the possible future. Therefore, visioning can mean seeing in a utopian way what does not yet exist on earth, but might exist in another realm, such as the ideal or perfect realm as imagined or thought. Examples are Buckminster Fuller in architecture and design, and some of the pioneers of personal computing such as Steve Wozniak. Some people use mathematics to make visionary discoveries in the nature of the universe. In that sense, a visionary may also function as a secular prophet. Some visionaries emphasize communication, and some assume a figurehead role in organizing a social group.
Artists may produce work loosely categorized as visionary art for its luminous content and/or for its use of artistic techniques that call for the use of extended powers of perception in the viewer: (e.g. Gustave Moreau, Samuel Palmer, Jean Delville, Ernst Fuchs, the French Symbolist Odilon Redon, Brion Gysin, Max Ernst, Stanley Spencer, Edward Burne Jones, Adolf Wolfli, Fred Sandback, William Blake, Hieronymus Bosch, and Henry Darger).
Visionary art can be incorrectly defined as a category of primitive art (art of those not formally trained) rather than describing people who have used their visions (or dreams) to create their paintings. Salvador Dali is one artist who would exemplify visionary art that is neither religious nor primitive.

Ted Nelson

Theodor Holm Nelson (Ted Nelson, born 1937) is an American sociologist, philosopher, and pioneer of information technology. He coined the terms "hypertext" and "hypermedia" in 1963 and published it in 1965. He also is credited with first use of the words "transclusion", "virtuality", "intertwingularity" and "teledildonics". The main thrust of his work has been to make computers easily accessible to ordinary people. His motto is: "A user interface should be so simple that a beginner in an emergency can understand it within ten seconds." However, he is known for inventing many new words (neologisms) which few other people understand (such as "intertwingularity"), and his remarks contain humor to entertain rather than just inform. Consequently, some of his ideas have been met with negative reactions.
From a pessimist viewpoint, Ted Nelson promotes four maxims: "most people are fools, most authority is malignant, God does not exist, and everything is wrong".
Nelson started Project Xanadu in 1960. He wanted to create a new computer network that was easy to use and easy to understand. He wrote about the project in his books "Computer Lib/Dream Machines" (1974) and "Literary Machines" (1981). He has spent much of his adult life working on Project Xanadu and telling people about its benefits.
The Xanadu project was not very successful. There were many reasons, but not everyone agrees why the project did not go well. Journalist Gary Wolf published an unflattering history, "The Curse of Xanadu", on Nelson and his project in the June 1995 issue of "Wired". Nelson expressed his disgust on his website, referring to Wolf as a "Gory Jackal", and threatened to sue him. He also outlined his objections in a letter to "Wired", and released a detailed rebuttal of the article.
Nelson says that Tim Berners-Lee made some ideas from Xanadu become true by inventing the World Wide Web. But, Nelson dislikes the World Wide Web, XML, and all embedded markup. Nelson thinks that Berners-Lee's work is a much too simple way of doing his original plan:
HTML is precisely what we were trying to PREVENT– ever-breaking links, links going outward only, quotes you can't follow to their origins, no version management, no rights management. – Ted Nelson (Ted Nelson one-liners )
Nelson co-founded Itty bitty machine company, or "IBM", which was a small computer retail store operating from 1977 to 1980 in Evanston, Illinois. The Itty bitty machine company was one of the few retail stores to sell the original Apple I computer. In 1978 he had a significant impact upon IBM's thinking when he outlined his vision of the potential of personal computing to the team that three years later launched the IBM PC.
Ted Nelson is currently working on a new information structure, ZigZag. More information about ZigZag is on the Xanadu project website. That website also has two versions of the Xanadu code that visitors can download. He is also currently developing XanaduSpace - a system for the exploration of connected parallel documents (an early version of this software may be freely downloaded from . He is a visiting fellow at Oxford University - based at the Oxford Internet Institute - where he works in the fields of information, computers, and human-machine interfaces.
Nelson earned a Bachelor's degree in philosophy from Swarthmore College in 1959, a Master's degree in sociology from Harvard University in 1963 and a Doctorate in Media and Governance from Keio University in 2002.
In 1998, at the Seventh WWW Conference in Brisbane, Australia, Ted Nelson was awarded the Yuri Rubinsky Memorial Award. He told the audience that it was the first award that he had ever received for his work.
In 2001 he was knighted by France as "Officier des Arts et Lettres". In 2004 he was appointed as a Fellow of Wadham College, Oxford, and associated with the Oxford Internet Institute, where he is currently conducting his research.
In 2007 he celebrated his 70th birthday by giving an invited birthday lecture at the University of Southampton.
He is the son of the late Emmy Award-winning director Ralph Nelson and the Academy Award-winning actress Celeste Holm.
His parents' marriage was brief, and he was mostly raised by his grandparents in Greenwich Village, with relatively little contact with his parents. He is partly of Norwegian descent.
The anime "Serial Experiments Lain" cites Project Xanadu as a precursor to The Wired (a fictional internet-like communications network and augmented reality system) and mentions Nelson as the originator of hypertext.
"Populitism" ("pop-u-leet-ism") is another neologism coined by Nelson, as a combination of the word "populism" with "elite". It refers to treating the general populace with the privileges of elitism. The word suggests the society-of-text envisioned by theorists like Shoshana Zuboff and Jay David Bolter, a writing space in which traces of authority persist only as local and contingent effects, the social equivalent of the deconstructed author-function. A "populite" culture might mark the first step toward realization of Jean-Francois Lyotard's "game of perfect information" where all have equal access to the world of data, and where "[g]iven equal competence (no longer in the acquisition of knowledge, but in its production), what extra performativity depends on in the final analysis is 'imagination,' which allows one either to make a new move or change the rules of the game." This is the utopia of information-in-process, the ultimate wetware dream of the clerisy: discourse converted with 100 percent efficiency into capital, the mechanism of that magical process being nomology or rule-making—admittedly a rather specialized form of "imagination."

<doc id="264942" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264942" title="Gunnysacking">
Gunnysacking

Gunnysacking is a metaphor, used in conflict resolution, which involves the act of "storing up" grievances acquired in the course of a relationship, rather than resolve them when they first occurred. The word is based on the idea of using a gunny sack (burlap bag) storing a number of items. 
A typical example might occur in a marriage facing occasional difficulty. Partners may have small grievances or annoyances, which by themselves are not critical. However, over time one partner gets less happy and more annoyed. Then some incident occurs, and a full-blown argument follows. By analogy, this is the gunny sack bursting, with an 'overblown reaction'.
The term may also refer to bringing up past grievances when trying to resolve some present problem in a relationship. In which case, gunnysacking (as a tactic) has the dual effect of raising additional problems (in what is typically already a volatile, difficult situation) and presents a side-track obstacle to dealing with the current issues. Additionally, once the practice becomes a familiar pattern used by one person in a relationship, other persons may avoid reporting new issues or problems for the sake of avoiding a repeat of the gunnysacking behavior.

<doc id="264944" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264944" title="Conflict resolution">
Conflict resolution

Conflict resolution is a set of ideas and ways to reduce sources of conflict. The term "conflict resolution" is sometimes used interchangeably with the term "dispute resolution". The terms "conflict" and "dispute" overlap. As a term, conflict is broader than dispute, more concerned with physical action, and less concerned with verbal arguments.
Processes of conflict resolution generally include negotiation, mediation, and diplomacy. The processes of arbitration, litigation, and formal complaint processes such as ombudsman processes, are usually described with the term dispute resolution, although some refer to them as "conflict resolution".
Conflict resolution as both a professional practice and academic field is highly sensitive to cultural background. In Western cultural contexts, such as Canada and the United States, successful conflict resolution usually involves fostering communication among disputants and problem solving that meet their underlying needs. In these situations, conflict resolvers often talk about finding the "win-win" solution, or mutually satisfying scenario, for everyone involved (see Fisher and Ury (1981), "Getting to Yes"). 
In many non-Western cultural contexts, such as Afghanistan, Vietnam, and China, it is also important to find "win-win" solutions; however, getting there can be very different. In these contexts, direct communication between disputants that explicitly addresses the issues at stake in the conflict can be perceived as very rude, making the conflict worse and delaying resolution. Rather, it can make sense to involve religious, tribal or community leaders, communicate difficult truths indirectly through a third party, and make suggestions through stories (see David Augsberger (1992), "Conflict Mediation Across Cultures"). Intercultural conflicts are often the most difficult to resolve because the expectations of the disputants can be very different, and there is much occasion for misunderstanding.
Conflict resolution has also been studied in non-humans, like dogs, cats, monkeys, snakes, elephants, and primates (see Frans de Waal, 2000). Aggression is more common among animal relatives and within a group, than between groups. Instead of creating a distance between the individuals, however, the primates were more intimate in the period after the aggressive incident. These intimacies consisted of grooming and various forms of body contact. Stress responses, like an increased heart rate, usually decrease after these reconciliatory signals. Different types of primates, as well as many other species who are living in groups, show different types of conciliatory behaviour. Resolving conflicts that threaten the interaction between individuals in a group is necessary for survival, hence has a strong evolutionary value. These findings contradicted previous existing theories about the general function of aggression, i.e. creating space between individuals (first proposed by Konrad Lorenz), which seems to be more the case in conflicts between groups than it is within groups.
In addition to research in primates, biologists are beginning to explore reconciliation in other animals. Up until recently, the literature dealing with reconciliation in non-primates have consisted of anecdotal observations and very little quantitative data. Although peaceful, post-conflict behavior had been documented going back to the 1960s, it was not until 1993 that Rowell made the first explicit mention of reconciliation in feral sheep. Reconciliation has since been documented in spotted hyenas, lions, dolphins, dwarf mongooses, domestic goats, and domestic dogs.
Conflict resolution is an expanding field of professional practice, both in the U.S. and around the world. The escalating costs of conflict have increased use of third parties who may serve as arbitrators, mediators, facilitators, and ombudsmen or conflict specialists to resolve conflicts. In fact, relief and development organizations have added peace-building specialists to their teams. Also, many of the major international NGOs have seen a growing need to hire practitioners trained in conflict analysis and resolution. Furthermore, this expansion of the field has resulted in the need for conflict resolution practitioners to work in a variety of settings such as in businesses, court systems, government agencies nonprofit organizations, government agencies and educational institutions serving throughout the world.
Universities worldwide offer programs of study pertaining to conflict research, analysis, and practice. The Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations (ILR) houses the Scheinman Institute on Conflict Resolution, which offers undergraduate, graduate, and professional training on conflict resolution. Additional graduate programs are offered at Georgetown University, Eastern Mennonite University and Trinity College Dublin. George Mason University’s Institute of Conflict Analysis and Resolution offers undergraduate, certificate and masters programs in Conflict Analysis and Resolution and a Ph.D. program in The Philosophy in Conflict and Conflict Resolution.
Furthermore, the Pax Ludens Foundation based in the Netherlands is an organization that puts together conflict resolution simulations set in an International Relations scenario to help students learn about the intricacies of where conflict emerges in the world of international politics.
Conflict resolution is a growing area of interest in UK pedagogy, with teachers and students both encouraged to learn about mechanisms that lead to aggressive action, and those that lead to peaceful resolution. 
In many schools in the UK, conflict resolution has now become an integral part of the SEAL (Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning) programme, chiming,as it does, with the SEAL principles of developing social skills and an understanding of ones own feelings.
In India, masters in conflict analysis and peace building is offered by Nelson Mandela Centre for Peace, in Jamia Millia Islamia university in New Delhi.

Wikipedia:Add wikilinked sections to balance NPOV

This essay, Add wikilinked sections to balance NPOV, describes a technique for resolving the age-old question: "How can an outrageous claim (from a source) be mentioned, in an article, while also defusing all the wild implications of that claim?" For example, sources might state, "Movie star XX had been arrested when a teenager on charges of prostitution." Such a claim, when stated in an article, could imply guilt as noted, unless thoroughly refuted with ample details to counter the suspicions raised by the claim. To omit a major claim, totally, might be a case of censorship, so the problem is how to offset a claim, while maintaining NPOV-neutral balance in the text.
In general, an article can be expanded to provide more balance, in accordance with policy , by wikilinking to sections which elaborate the details about "The Rest of the Story". As an example, consider the handling of some highly controversial topics within a hypothetical crime article.
Suppose that reliable sources, for a crime article, had reported an extreme viewpoint, of the house seeming "thoroughly cleaned with bleach" but then the article immediately countered that extreme claim, by linking an opposing section, such as "Claims of bleach refuted at trial ". That structure (of point-of-view-1 refuted by point-of-view-2) allows both ideas to appear, side-by-side, as similar phrases, but also connects to a detailed explanation: listing all the details of the trial testimonies, where perhaps 2 housekeepers said the household bleach had remained unused, with no smell of bleach, and investigators found no chemical trace of bleaching or bleach-spots on fabrics at the scene. Luminol testing found no wide areas wiped with bleach, only bare footprints or smaller splotches in separate areas, such as might occur by stepping in spilled fruit juice, or walking through shower cleanser. Such a dedicated section of specific details could be used to provide the NPOV balance, without cluttering the article's text at the phrase where the idea of bleaching was initially mentioned. Totally removing any text about bleach, from the article, would be censorship, as an act of suppressing a notorious controversy in the criminal case.
Sometimes a one-phrase extreme claim could only be fully rebutted by several sentences, and so an equal word-count view, of the overall balance, tends to thwart adding all the necessary details to refute a claim, for an adequate neutral (NPOV) coverage. Instead, a one-phrase extreme claim can be followed by a wikilinked sub-section title which, in much more detail, will then offset the impact of the original extreme claim. For example:
The initial phrase "the Earth is flat" gives the impression that Aristotle was clueless about the Earth's rotation. However, that would be refuted in the wikilinked sub-section: "Aristotle view of Earth as pie plate rotating on edge". The initial sentence is very short, but all the details would be elaborated in the linked section, of how Aristotle wrote of the Earth as a flat pie plate, standing on edge, rotating on edge (once per day), while Plato, holding 2 opposing views, stated (1) the Earth was a sphere, and (2) the sphere did not rotate (but the cosmos spun around the sphere). Once those details are provided, then Aristotle seems a lot smarter, in recognizing the Earth as rotating on an axis, from ancient Greece circa 330 BC. Again, the technique is to offset-by-wikilink: state an extreme claim, followed by an opposing section title (containing the details). This technique would lead to a similar offset-by-wikilink, in a hypothetical crime article, such as the sentence:
Using that tactic, for every time the text must mention "sex-game" then immediately link to the total rebuttal as section "No evidence of sex-game found" (containing perhaps 15 sentences about exhaustive searches which found no sexual items used at the scene). To fully offset an outrageous claim of "sex-game", it must be stated that no sex books, no photos, no condoms, no restraints, no lotions, no aphrodisiacs, no wine, none of them, were found there. That is a versatile technique to offset highly extreme claims (which were totally refuted in detail), and offset them every time when mentioned, to sustain a neutral NPOV balance.
Aristotle wrote of the Earth as a flat pie plate, standing on edge, rotating on edge (once per day), while Plato, holding 2 opposing views, stated (1) the Earth was a sphere, and (2) the sphere did not rotate. In Plato's view, the entire Cosmos spun around the sphere, fixed in the center.
Despite the unfounded claim, publicized for more than a year, claiming the suspects had met for a supposed "sex-game" (Italian: "gioco sessuale" or "gioco erotico"), no evidence was ever found of any sexual items used at the scene. Italian police and CSI investigators found no sex books, no photos, no condoms, no restraints, no lotions, no aphrodisiacs, no drugs, no wine, no alcohol, none of them, at the scene, which was searched twice, 6 weeks apart. The first search of the scene occurred on 2-3 November 1896, and the second search occurred on 18 December 1896. The autopsy revealed no trace of drugs or alcohol either. There was no evidence of a sex game, of any form.
Otherwise, per , an article could be seen as leading a reader into an unstated conclusion, into imagining that evidence of a sex-game had been found, when in fact, there was no evidence. Not every misled conclusion can be avoided, but in the case of wild claims (of lurid activities), then reader suspicions would be obvious, and so an article should have the extra text to thoroughly offset those claims, based on all aspects noted in the sources.
Hence, a seemingly hopeless character-assassination issue can be directly diffused and avoided in a very simple manner, by linking to an article section which offsets the claim.

Bent Larsen

Jørgen Bent Larsen (4 March 1935–9 September 2010) was a Danish chess Grandmaster. He was a six-time Danish champion, and a candidate for the World Chess Championship on four occasions: 1965, 1968, 1971, and 1977. He won three Interzonal tournaments: Amsterdam 1964, Sousse 1967, and Biel 1976. Larsen won several dozen major international tournaments during his career, and was awarded the first Chess Oscar in 1967. At his best he was rated (FIDE rating list) fourth in the world.
Larsen was the strongest chess player born in Denmark, and the strongest Scandinavian until the emergence of Magnus Carlsen. From the early 1970s, he lived for part of the year in Las Palmas, and in Buenos Aires, with his Argentinian-born wife.
Bent represented Denmark six times in Chess Olympiads, always on first board, and compiled an aggregate score of 75/109 (+61 =28 −20), for 68.8%, according to olimpbase.org. He always played a very high number of games, almost all of the rounds, and won three board medals, one gold and two bronze.
The worst result of his career was his 6–0 defeat by Bobby Fischer in the semi-finals of the Candidates matches in 1971. The match was played in Denver, Colorado. Larsen later claimed in a Kasparov.com interview (1998) that his one-sided loss to Fischer was due in part to his condition during the match: "The organizers chose the wrong time for this match. I was languid with the heat and Fischer was better prepared for such exceptional circumstances... I saw chess pieces through a mist and, thus, my level of playing was not good". Fischer was the great player of the day, and went on to beat Spassky in 1972 for the World Championship.

Wikipedia:98 percent table width anomaly

This essay, WP:98 percent table width anomaly addresses the issue of some tables (since 2008, still in September 2010), with class=wikitable or class=infobox triggering the bottom scroll bar when width is set above 98%. The over-wide display has been caused by automatic extra-margin padding, as either: wider margin-right for class=wikitable, or wider margin-left for infoboxes. This issue is about the top-level tables on a page, not about tables (with width=100%) inside other tables. Perhaps the full-name of the essay could be: "98-percent table-width anomaly triggering bottom scroll-bars for top-level, CSS-class tables". The problem does not occur for other tables, without the keyword "class=".
Normally, a plain table (with no "class=") can be sized to any width up to "100%" without triggering a bottom scrollbar. However, the styles for "class=wikitable" or "wikitable sortable" have added an implicit right-side margin-right padding that fits okay up to 98% width. When sized to 99% or 100%, those class=wikitable formats have triggered a bottom scollbar (since 2008, as of June 2009), appearing along the bottom of the window. To avoid this situation, use:
The option for "margin-right:0" removes the right-side margin padding outside the box, rather than having a margin of 1em or 20px, or such.
Note that a full-screen table of width=101% (or higher), always triggers a bottom scrollbar, as expected, because 101%>100 (the full window width).
Normally, a plain box table (with no "class=") can be sized to any width up to "100%" without triggering a bottom scrollbar. However, the various styles for "class=infobox" add an implicit left-side margin-left padding that fits okay up to 98% width. When sized to 99% or 100%, those class=infobox formats have triggered a bottom scollbar (since 2008, as of March 2009), appearing along the bottom of the window. To avoid this situation, use:
The option for "margin-left:0" removes the left-side margin padding outside the infobox, rather than having a margin of 1em or 20px, or such.
Although some might wish to consider the default limitation of CSS-class tables (to width=98%) as a bug, when tables are nested within other tables, then a wikitable of 100%-width will still add the same right-side padding as at width 50%, 80% or 98%. The problem of over-wide tables occurs at the top level, when 100% is the entire window, with no "outside space" to have padded. Because of the relative viewpoint, the situation is termed an "anomaly". One man's bug is another man's "clever feature" when the padding is added inside other tables, when formatting a table-within-a-table, etc.
The issue of determining "top-level tables" is complicated by the use of templates: a table coded inside a template might seem to be a top-level table. However, if the template were invoked inside an outer table, then the result would generate nested tables. Instead, the table padding generated by the template is the same, whether viewing the template in stand-alone mode, or when transcluded into another page. A similar complex issue is the use of subheaders ("==Subheader==") inside a template, and determining which page contains that labeled section for editing, because appearing on a formatted page does not mean the heading exists inside that page, just inside the template displayed for that page. These problems of nesting are related to side-effects of recursion.
"As a final reminder:" The scrollbar problem only occurs for top-level tables in CSS classes, such as class=wikitable or class=infobox. A plain table (with no "class=") can be resized up to 100% without triggering a bottom scrollbar.
Many of those essays also apply to the full English Wikipedia.

Wikipedia:Allow time to melt and look again

This essay, WP:Allow time to melt and look again explains the need to use more time to make some decisions. More often than might be expected, a procedure requires far more time (not less), to fully process, and consider, all aspects of a situation. Perhaps some cases might require twice as long to process, compared to typical cases. It might, at first, seem obvious what a user could accomplish, but upon further inspection, a different view might emerge of the user's true potential.
As an analogy, on the surface, some snowballs might appear to be solid snow, but instead, a snowball can contain a large rock or stone, inside, which is revealed only when it melts.
Depending on how cold the surrounding environment, a snowball might require much longer to melt, even "years" longer in permafrost conditions. Scientists, when digging into glaciers in Antarctica, have reported finding many prehistoric fossils, lying on top of glacial snow, for the first time in 10,000 years, when the upper snow melted, revealing the fossilized rock fragments underneath.
Sometimes, when judging a decision, the general environment is cold to new ideas, or alternate interpretations, and it can require more time to melt their attitudes. For that reason, a final judgment can require far more time to be fully processed, depending on how cold the reception has been. A quick decision (a "knee-jerk" reaction) might be a big mistake. Compare the process to an appellate trial, as needing extra time to melt through layers of misunderstandings, to reach a better, final judgment.
Not until a snowball melts, does the truth inside become revealed. Melting can require more time than typically allotted for an activity. Hence, be prepared to "slow down" now, to determine a better decision, and better results, later. The Hare seemed faster than the Tortoise, but recall who won the race.

Google Search

Google Search or Google Web Search is a web search engine owned by Google Inc. and is the most-used search engine on the World Wide Web. Google receives several hundred million queries each day through its various services.
The main purpose of Google Search is to hunt for text in webpages, as opposed to other data, such as with Google Image Search. Google search was originally developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1997, based on earlier search-engine designs.
Google Search provides at least 22 special features beyond the original word-search capability. These include synonyms, weather forecasts, time zones, stock quotes, maps, earthquake data, movie showtimes, airports, home listings, and sports results. ("see below:" Special features). There are special features for numbers, including ranges (70..73), prices, temperatures, money/unit conversions ("10.5 cm in inches"), calculations ( 3*4+sqrt(6)-pi/2 ), package tracking, patents, area codes, and language translation of displayed pages.
The order of search results (ghits for "Google hits") on Google's search-results pages is based, in part, on a priority rank called a "PageRank". Google Search provides many options for customized search ("see below:" Search options), using Boolean operators such as: exclusion ("-xx"), inclusion ("+xx"), alternatives ("xx OR yy"), and wildcard ("x * x").
Google's rise to success was in large part due to a patented algorithm called PageRank that helps rank web pages that match a given search string.
Previous keyword-based methods of ranking search results, used by many search engines that were once more popular than Google, would rank pages by how often the search terms occurred in the page, or how strongly associated the search terms were within each resulting page.
The PageRank algorithm instead analyses human-generated links, assuming that web pages linked from many important pages are themselves likely to be important. The algorithm computes a recursive score for pages, based on the weighted sum of the PageRanks of the pages linking to them. PageRank is thought to correlate well with human concepts of importance.
In addition to PageRank, Google over the years has added many other secret criteria for determining the ranking of pages on result lists, reported to be over 200 different indicators. The details are kept secret due to spammers and in order to maintain an advantage over Google's competitors.
The exact percentage of the total of web pages that Google indexes is not known, as it is very hard to actually calculate.
Google not only indexes and caches web pages but also takes "snapshots" of other file types, which include PDF, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, Flash SWF, plain text files, and so on. Except in the case of text and SWF files, the cached version is a conversion to (X)HTML, allowing those without the corresponding viewer application to read the file.
Users can customize the search engine, by setting a default language, using the "SafeSearch" filtering technology and set the number of results shown on each page. Google has been criticized for placing long-term cookies on users' machines to store these preferences, a tactic which also enables them to track a user's search terms and retain the data for more than a year. For any query, up to the first 1000 results can be shown with a maximum of 100 displayed per page. The ability to specify the number of results is available only if "Instant Search" is not enabled. If "Instant Search" is enabled, only 10 results are displayed, regardless of this setting.
Despite its immense index, there is also a considerable amount of data available in online databases which are accessible by means of queries but not by links. This so-called invisible or deep Web is minimally covered by Google and other search engines. The deep Web contains library catalogs, official legislative documents of governments, phone books, and other content which is dynamically prepared to respond to a query.
Privacy in some countries forbids the showing of some links. For instance in Switzerland any individual can force Google Inc. to delete a link which contains their name.
Since Google is the most popular search engine, many webmasters have become eager to influence their website's Google rankings. An industry of consultants has arisen to help websites increase their rankings on Google and on other search engines. This field, called search engine optimization, attempts to discern patterns in search engine listings, and then develop a methodology for improving rankings to draw more searchers to their client's sites.
Search engine optimization encompasses both "on page" factors (like body copy, title elements, H1 heading elements and image alt attribute values) and Off Page Optimization factors (like anchor text and PageRank). The general idea is to affect Google's relevance algorithm by incorporating the keywords being targeted in various places "on page", in particular the title element and the body copy (note: the higher up in the page, presumably the better its keyword prominence and thus the ranking). Too many occurrences of the keyword, however, cause the page to look suspect to Google's spam checking algorithms.
Google has published guidelines for website owners who would like to raise their rankings when using legitimate optimization consultants.
Google search consists of a series of localized websites. The largest of those, the google.com site, is the top most-visited website in the world. Some of its features include a definition link for most searches including dictionary words, the number of results you got on your search, links to other searches (e.g. for words that Google believes to be misspelled, it provides a link to the search results using its proposed spelling), and many more.
Google's search engine normally accepts queries as a simple text, and breaks up the user's text into a sequence of search terms, which will usually be words that are to occur in the results, but one can also use Boolean operators, such as: quotations marks (") for a phrase, a prefix such as "+", "-" for qualified terms, or one of several advanced operators, such as "site:". The webpages of "Google Search Basics" describe each of these additional queries and options ("see below:" Search options).
Google's Advanced Search web form gives several additional fields which may be used to qualify searches by such criteria as date of first retrieval. All advanced queries transform to regular queries, usually with additional qualified terms.
Google applies query expansion to the submitted search query, transforming it into the query that will actually be used to retrieve results. As with page ranking, the exact details of the algorithm Google uses are deliberately obscure, but certainly the following transformations are among those that occur:
Google's homepage includes a button labeled "I'm Feeling Lucky". When a user clicks on the button the user will be taken directly to the first search result, bypassing the search engine results page. The thought is that if a user is "feeling lucky", the search engine will return the perfect match the first time without having to page through the search results. According to a study by Tom Chavez of "Rapt", this feature costs Google $110 million a year as 1% of all searches use this feature and bypass all advertising.
On October 30, 2009, for some users, the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button was removed from Google's main page, along with the regular search button. Both buttons were replaced with a field that reads, "This space intentionally left blank." This text faded out when the mouse was moved on the page, and normal search functionality is achieved by filling in the search field with the desired terms and pressing enter. A Google spokesperson explains, "This is just a test, and a way for us to gauge whether our users will like an even simpler search interface." Personalized Google homepages retained both buttons and their normal functions.
On May 21, 2010, the 30th anniversary of Pac-Man, the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button was replaced with a button reading the words "Insert Coin". After pressing the button, the user would begin a Google-themed game of Pac-Man in the area where the Google logo would normally be. Pressing the button a second time would begin a two-player version of the same game that includes Ms. Pacman for player 2. This version can be accessed at http://www.google.com/pacman as a permanent link to the page.
On 12 May 2009, Google announced that they would be parsing the hCard, hReview, and hProduct microformats and using them to populate search result pages with what they called "Rich Snippets".
Besides the main search-engine feature of searching for text, Google Search has more than 22 "special features" (activated by entering any of dozens of "trigger words") when searching:
The webpages maintained by the Google Help Center have text describing more than 15 various search options.
The Google operators:
Some of the query options are as follows:
The page-display options (or query types) are:
Note that Google searches the HTML coding inside a webpage, not the screen appearance: the words displayed on a screen might not be listed in the same order in the HTML coding.
Some searches will give a 403 Forbidden error with the text
"We're sorry...
... but your query looks similar to automated requests from a computer virus or spyware application. To protect our users, we can't process your request right now.
We'll restore your access as quickly as possible, so try again soon. In the meantime, if you suspect that your computer or network has been infected, you might want to run a virus checker or spyware remover to make sure that your systems are free of viruses and other spurious software.
We apologise for the inconvenience, and hope we'll see you again from all of the team here at Google."
sometimes followed by a CAPTCHA prompt.
The screen was first reported in 2005, and was a response to the heavy use of Google by search engine optimization companies to check on ranks of sites they were optimizing. The message is triggered by high volumes of requests from a single IP address. Google apparently uses the Google cookie as part of its determination of refusing service.
In June 2009, after the death of pop superstar Michael Jackson, this message appeared to many internet users who were searching Google for news stories related to the singer, and was assumed by Google to be a DDoS attack, although many queries were submitted by legitimate searchers.
Google flags search results with the message "This site may harm your computer" if the site is known to install malicious software in the background or otherwise surreptitiously. Google does this to protect users against visiting sites that could harm their computers. For approximately 40 minutes on January 31, 2009, "all" search results were mistakenly classified as malware and could therefore not be clicked; instead a warning message was displayed and the user was required to enter the requested URL manually. The bug was caused by human error. The URL of "/" (which expands to all URLs) was mistakenly added to the malware patterns file.
On certain occasions, the logo on Google's webpage will change to a special version, known as a "Google Doodle". Clicking on the Doodle links to a string of Google search results about the topic. The first was a reference to the Burning Man Festival in 1998, and others have been produced for the birthdays of notable people like Albert Einstein, historical events like the interlocking Lego block's 50th anniversary and holidays like Valentine's Day.
In August 2009, Google announced the rollout of a new search architecture, codenamed "Caffeine".
The new architecture was designed to return results faster and to better deal with rapidly updated information from services including Facebook and Twitter.
Google developers noted that most users would notice little immediate change, but invited developers to test the new search in its sandbox.
Differences noted for their impact upon search engine optimization included heavier keyword weighting and the importance of the domain's age.
The move was interpreted in some quarters as a response to Microsoft's recent release of an upgraded version of its own search service, renamed Bing.
Google announced completion of Caffeine on 8 June 2010, claiming 50% fresher results due to continuous updating of its index.
With Caffeine, Google moved its back-end indexing system away from MapReduce and onto BigTable, the company's distributed database platform. Caffeine is also based on Colossus, or GFS2, an overhaul of the GFS distributed file system.
In May 2010 Google rolled out SSL-encrypted web search. The encrypted search can be accessed at: https://encrypted.google.com
Google Instant, an enhancement that displays suggested results while the user types, was introduced in the United States starting on September 8, 2010. One concern is that people will select one of the suggested results instead of finishing their request, and that such a practice could cause bias toward familiar businesses or other search terms. Pornographic or otherwise offensive search terms are excluded from the suggested results. The instant feature appears only on the basic Google site and not specialized iGoogle pages. Google expects Google Instant to save users 2 to 5 seconds in every search, which they say will be collectively 11 million seconds per hour. Search engine marketing pundits speculate that Google Instant will have a great impact on local and paid search.
In concert with the Google Instant launch, Google disabled the ability of users to choose to see more than 10 search results per page. Instant Search can be disabled via Google's "preferences" menu, but autocomplete-style search suggestions now cannot be disabled. A Google representative stated, "It's in keeping with our vision of a unified Google search experience to make popular, useful features part of the default experience, rather than maintain different versions of Google. As Autocomplete quality has improved, we felt it was appropriate to have it always on for all of our users."
Google is available in many languages and has been localized for many countries.
The interface has also been made available in some languages for humorous purpose:
In addition to the main URL Google.com, Google Inc. owns 160 domain names for each of the countries/regions in which it has been localized. As Google is an American company, the main domain name can be considered as the U.S. one. For a list of the current domain names, see .
Some domain names unregistered by Google are currently squatted, such as "Google.ua" (for Ukraine, where the correct URL is "google.com.ua").
In addition to its tool for searching webpages, Google also provides services for searching images, Usenet newsgroups, news websites, videos, searching by locality, maps, and items for sale online. In 2006, Google has indexed over 25 billion web pages, 400 million queries per day, 1.3 billion images, and over one billion Usenet messages. It also caches much of the content that it indexes. Google operates other tools and services including Google News, Google Suggest, Google Product Search, Google Maps, Google Co-op, Google Earth, Google Docs, Picasa, Panoramio, YouTube, Google Translate, Google Blog Search and Google Desktop Search.
There are also products available from Google that are not directly search-related. Gmail, for example, is a webmail application, but still includes search features; Google Browser Sync does not offer any search facilities, although it aims to organize your browsing time.
Also Google starts many new beta products, like Google Social Search or Google Image Swirl.
Google claims that a search query requires altogether about 1 kJ or 0.0003 kW·h.

Fade (audio engineering)

In audio engineering, a fade is a gradual increase (fade-in) or decrease (fade-out) in the level of an audio signal. The term can also be used for film cinematography or theatre lighting, in much the same way (see: fade (filmmaking)).
A recorded song may be gradually reduced to silence at its end ("fade-out"), or may gradually increase from silence at the beginning ("fade-in"). For example, the songs "Bitter Sweet Symphony" by The Verve and "Turn to Stone" by Electric Light Orchestra fade in from the beginning, while the songs "Born to Be Wild" by Steppenwolf, "Boogie Oogie Oogie" by A Taste of Honey, and "Hey Jude" by The Beatles fade out. However, "Born to be Wild" and "Boogie Oogie Oogie" fade out in a matter of seconds, whereas "Hey Jude" takes over 2 minutes to completely fade out. "Goodbye Stranger" by Supertramp takes about a minute to fade out. Fading-out can serve as a recording solution for pieces of music that contain no obvious ending.
Though relatively rare, songs can fade out, then fade back in. Some examples of this are "Helter Skelter" by The Beatles, "Suspicious Minds" by Elvis Presley, "Thank You" by Led Zeppelin or "Undercover of the Night" by The Rolling Stones.
The term "fade" is also used in multi-speaker audio systems to describe the balancing of power between front and rear channels.
"Neptune", part of the orchestral suite, "The Planets", by Gustav Holst, was an early piece of music to have a fade-out ending. Holst stipulates that the women's choruses are "to be placed in an adjoining room, the door of which is to be left open until the last bar of the piece, when it is to be slowly and silently closed", and that the final bar (scored for choruses alone) is "to be repeated until the sound is lost in the distance". Although commonplace today, the effect bewitched audiences in the era before widespread recorded sound—after the initial 1918 run-through, Holst's daughter, Imogen (in addition to watching the charwomen dancing in the aisles during "Jupiter") remarked that the ending was "unforgettable, with its hidden chorus of women's voices growing fainter and fainter... until the imagination knew no difference between sound and silence".
The technique of ending a spoken or musical recording by fading out the sound goes back to the earliest days of recording. In the era of mechanical (pre-electrical) recording, this could only be achieved by either moving the sound source away from the recording horn, or by gradually reducing the volume at which the performer/s were singing, playing or speaking. With the advent of electrical recording, smooth and controllable fadeout effects could be easily achieved by simply reducing the input volume from the microphones using the fader on the mixing desk.
No single recording can be reliably identified as "the first" to use the technique. In 2003, on the (now-defunct) website "Stupid Question", John Ruch listed the following recordings as possible contenders:
A fader is any device used for fading, especially when it is a knob or button that "slides" along a track or slot. A knob which "rotates" is usually not considered a fader, although it is electrically and functionally equivalent. A fader can be either analogue, directly controlling the resistance or impedance to the source (e.g. a Potentiometer); or digital, numerically controlling a digital signal processor (DSP). Digital faders are also referred to as "virtual" faders, since they can be viewed on the screen of a digital audio workstation. Modern high-end digital mixers often have piezo-electric actuators attached to the faders such that they can be multi-use and will jump to the correct position for the selected function and/or saved setting.
A crossfader on a dj mixer essentially functions like two faders connected side-by-side, but in opposite directions. It allows a DJ to fade one source out while fading another source in at the same time. This is extremely useful when beatmatching two phonograph records or compact discs.
The technique of crossfading is also used in audio engineering as a mixing technique, particularly with instrumental solos. A mix engineer will often record two or more takes of a vocal or instrumental part and create a final version which is a composite of the best passages of these takes by crossfading between each track.
In the perfect case the crossfader would keep constant output level. However, there's no standard how this should be achieved. Many DJ equipment manufacturers offer different mixers for different purposes (e.g. scratching, beatmixing, cut mixing, etc.). High-end mixers often have crossfade curve switches allowing the DJ to select the type of crossfade necessary. Experienced DJs are also able to crossfade between tracks using the channel faders.
There are many software applications that feature virtual crossfaders. For instance, burning-software for the recording of audio-CDs.
On a mixer with auxiliary send mixes, the send mixes are configured pre-fader or post-fader.
If a send mix is configured pre-fader, then changes to the main channel strip fader does not affect the send mix. This is useful for stage monitor mixes where changes in the Front of House channel levels would distract the musicians.
If a send mix is configured post-fader, then the level sent to the send mix follows changes to the main channel strip fader. This is useful for reverberation and other signal processor effects.

Wikipedia:Avoiding Wikipedia quirks

This essay is intended to try to explain what is happening, hourly, to the Wikipedia system, and to suggest work-around solutions. Everything is changing, without warning, and lots of it is quirky. There are hundreds of unusual, or unexpected quirks or glitches in the way things sort-of-do, sort-of-don't work. On any given day, new problems might arise, or old problems get fixed, as the developers adjust the servers or hack the MediaWiki code to alter character-shift typesetting for the 200+ Wikipedia languages (see below: "Why quirks occur").
Not all problems are caused by Wikipedia's software configuration. Many problems are actually from each user's PC setup or browser, such as pressing F5 or <Esc> (before edit-preview) and losing all edit-text (see below: "Browser nightmares"). Also, Wikipedia is not alone in having website quirks, even Google has had them (see section below: "Google quirks").
There are several issues about page formatting:
There are some issues about editing a page:
The MediaWiki markup language is a peculiar twisto-mash of 3 computer languages. The most normal language is the typical free-flowing text that allows triple-quote bold-font, along with the HTML tags, such as <ref>...</ref>. However, along with that stuff, there is a 2nd language as wikitable codes (in ), so that a table begins with "" which formerly were required in column 1 but can be indented now (at least sometimes, or maybe not whatever). Then there is the 3rd language: the "infamous" if-you-indent, you get "quotebox" yes the all-important quotebox, which in computer-typesetting typically requires only 2 markers; instead, just indent and the whole section turns into quotebox – quotebox – quotebox. Ah so, oh-so-important quotebox he look like:
So, anyway, put all 3 schidzo languages, blended together, and you get MediaWiki markup (or markdown?) language, affectionately known as "wikipuke". Well, as can be expected with multiple personality disorder (MPD), the 3 languages fight for power: when HTML code is formatted with typical indentation, the me-is-quotebox personality, at times, hijacks the page, and you get hypertext-markup-laughter displayed in a box that looks like (...wait for it...) a QuoteBox!
So important, the quotebox:
Many problems that users think are caused by Wikipedia are actually caused by limited Web browsers. For example, in some mainsteam browsers:
All of those problems are caused by quirky browser operation (not Wikipedia), as the browser does not reflect the way that people actually think. In advanced software design, users would be allowed to set preferences for text-wrapping, cursor-movement, cursor-shape, etc. Those preferences could be set to overcome some design flaws in the basic design of a system (such as a browser), until the more normal settings are preset as the defaults in later software versions.
The exact causes, behind each quirk, are perhaps too complex to explain in this essay. However, some general principles can explain how the problems have arisen, over the years.
Wikipedia's underlying software system, with the MediaWiki markup language, is constantly being changed to fix old problems and try to offer new, better features, but better for whom? Many changes are made to support the unusual typesetting needs of rare written languages that use split-character placement of text or other unusual options not seen in English or other European languages. The English Wikipedia is impacted because all 200+ languages share some common software, and that software gets changed for everyone.
Sometimes (or often?), some really bizarre features are added, such as allowing to pass newlines at the end of parameter values, simply by indenting the next line, when calling a template. Normally, bizarre features would be designed to require special coding to trigger those features, such as: if you want to pass newlines in parameter values, then specify them, explicitly, such as "param=aa#nuline;bb#nuline;cc#nuline;" where the code "#nuline;" or "<br>" (or some other invented thing) is the feature to be requested. Unfortunately, "one man's bizarreness is other man's ordinary dork-otopia" and some developers think that everyone should change their ways to adjust to the new stuff. Overly often, peculiar ideas are treated as mainstream "everyone-should-know-nerdisms" which become some of the widespread quirks that appear, from day to day.
Complicating the complications is the reality that, eventually, several multiple nerdisms are implemented. Rather than maintaining some basic, core levels of simplicity, the multiple nerdisms start interfering with earlier peculiar features, and the result becomes "conflicting nerdisms" with almost unpredictable, expanding quirks. Even the most level-headed, otherwise-normal software developers will become overwhelmed by the pre-exising nerdisms, so that even simple changes can introduce new quirks, and hence, no single group of people can be blamed for the combined, bizarre outcomes. Far surpassing "creeping featurism" the total system becomes "featured creepyism".
By considering the design flaws, and the operational instability, it is possible to get a better understanding of the psychological pressures that people face when using Wikipedia. Knowing the details, about specific quirks, can help avoid the stress or frustrations in the future.
Wikipedia is not alone in having many website quirks. Even Google Inc., with all the $billions, has had some very unusual things happening in the official websites (for years):
So even an organization with $billions of revenue cannot seem to avoid utterly spastic, peculiar quirks in their webpages. Perhaps the world is seeing a rapid growth in the rise of "nerdnology" as typical notions of quality control have been abandoned, almost everywhere. No longer are major changes tested on a sample user-group, but instead, released untested to the entire world. The quirks are not merely "planned obsolescence", similar to allowing computer viruses, which are known to kill user computers and cause people to buy new or fix-it software products (as the planned result). Instead, the quirks are not the work of college-dropout billionaires, but rather just a collection of misdirected changes.

Centenary Medal

The Centenary Medal is an award given by the Australian Government in 2001. It was set up to celebrate the Centenary of Federation of Australia and to honour people who have made a contribution to Australian society or government. Possible winners were studied by a group headed by the historian Professor Geoffrey Blainey.
The front of the medal has a seven-pointed Commonwealth Star, for the six Australian states, with the seventh point for Australia's territories. At the centre of the star is an image showing the Indigenous Australian traditions at the heart of the continent. Around the edge are 100 dots for 100 years of federation. The other side has a seven pointed star, with the words "For Contribution Made to Australian Society" around the edge.
The colours in the ribbon are crimson, which represents federation, and blue and gold for the beginning of the 21st Century. The seven gold and red lines signify the states' pathways to federation. The bar and ribbon are the same so that a person with the award can be recognized easily.

<doc id="264986" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264986" title="Backspace">
Backspace

Backspace is the keyboard key (sometimes labeled as: ← ) that originally pushed the typewriter carriage one position backwards, and for modern computer screens, moves the cursor one position backwards, deletes the preceding character, and shifts back the text after it by one position.
In typewriters, a typist would, for example, type a lowercase letter "a" with acute accent (á) by typing a lowercase letter "a" then backspace, and then the acute accent key (also known as overstrike). This is the basis for such spacing modifiers in computer character sets such as the ASCII caret (^, for the circumflex accent). Backspace composition no longer works with digital displays or typesetting systems. It has to some degree been replaced with the combining diacritical marks mechanism of Unicode, though such characters do not work well with many fonts, and precomposed characters continue to be used. Some software like TeX or Microsoft Windows use the opposite method for diacritical marks, namely positioning the accent first, and then placing the base letter at that position.
Pressing the backspace key on a computer terminal would generate the ASCII code 08, BS or Backspace, a control code which would delete the preceding character. That control code could also be accessed by pressing Control-H, as H is the eighth letter of the Latin alphabet. Terminals which did not have the backspace code mapped to the function of moving the cursor backwards and deleting the preceding character would display the symbols ^H (caret, H – see Caret notation) when the backspace key was pressed. This sequence is still used humorously for epanorthosis by computer literates, denoting the deletion of a pretended blunder, much like a strikethrough.
Example:
A more concise alternative sometimes seen is ^W, which is the shortcut to delete the previous word in the Berkeley Unix terminal line discipline. One ^W can replace a whole string of ^H's. This shortcut has also made it into the Vi text editor. For really embarrassing blunders, ^U (kill line) can outdo a series of ^W.
The backspace is distinct from the delete key, which in paper media for computers would punch out all the holes to strike out a character, and in modern computers deletes text "following" it. Also, the delete key often works as a generic command to remove an object (such as an image inside a document, or a file in a file manager), while backspace usually has no effect.
In modern systems, the backspace key is often mapped to the delete character (0x7f in ASCII or Unicode), although the backspace key's function of deleting the character before the cursor remains.
In a mainframe environment, "to backspace" means to move a magnetic tape backwards, typically to the previous block.
The backspace key is commonly used to go back a page when exploring folders in graphical environments, or when browsing the Web in web browsers.
Although the term "backspace" is the standard name of the key which deletes the character to the left of the cursor, the actual key may be labelled in a variety of ways, for example "delete", "Erase" (for example in XO-1, One Laptop Per Child), or with a left pointing arrow.

Marin Mersenne

Marin Mersenne, (born 8 September 1588, in modern-day Sarthe, died 1 September 1648, in Paris) was a French theologian and mathematician. He developed the first laws of acoustics, which was known by his name for a long time. Today, he is mainly remembered for the Mersenne primes. Together with Galileo Galilei he built the laws which describe how a mass falls in an empty space. He was in favour of modern science, and did not agree with "occultist" movements. 
He often travelled to meet great scientists, which made him an important mediator. This is especially true for mathematicians such as Pierre Gassendi, Gilles Personne de Roberval, Blaise Pascal und Pierre de Fermat. To tell Mersenne of a discovery was like publishing it. He told Gassendi to reply to the "Meditations" of Descartes. Mersenne gave Huygens the idea of using a pendulum to measure time. This led to the development of pendulum clocks.

Usage share of web browsers

The usage share of web browsers 
is the percentage (%) of viewers at a group of websites who use a particular web browser. For example, when it is said that Internet Explorer has 51% usage share, it means that some version of Internet Explorer is used by nearly 51 of every 100 visitors who visit a given set of websites.
It can be misleading to measure the browser usage in the number of requests (page hits) made by each user agent.
Not all requests are generated by a user, as a user agent can make requests at regular time intervals without user input. In this case the user's activity might be overestimated. Some examples:
It is also possible to underestimate the usage share by using the number of requests, for example:
The following table summarizes the usage share of browsers for August 2010.
Netapplications bases its usage share mainly on the usage statistics of 40,000 websites having around 160 million unique visitors.

Quatour pour la fin du temps

Quatuor pour la fin du temps is a piece of chamber music by the French composer Olivier Messiaen. In English -speaking countries it is often called by the English title Quartet for the End of Time. The piece is written for an unusual combination of four instruments: clarinet (in B-flat), violin, cello, and piano. There are 8 movements. It takes about 50 minutes to perform. The work was first performed in unusual circumstances in 1941. It is a very important work in the history of 20th century classical music.
There was a special reason why Messiaen wrote this work for an unusual combination of instruments. In 1940, when World War II was being fought, Germany invaded France. Messiaen was captured by the German army and he was held as a prisoner of war. While being taken to the prisoner of war camp, Messiaen talked to another prisoner, Henri Akoka, who was a clarinettist. Messiaen showed him the sketches for a clarinet piece he was writing called "Abîme des oiseaux". Two other professional musicians were also among the prisoners: Jean le Boulaire, a violinist and Étienne Pasquier, a cellist. Messiaen composed the "Quatuor" for these three musicians with himself at the piano. The combination of these four instruments is unusual, although Paul Hindemith had written a work for the same combination in 1938.
The quartet was given its first performance in Görlitz, Germany (now called Zgorzelec in Poland) on 15 January 1941. The audience consisted of about four hundred prisoners of war. There were German prison officers sitting in front. The music must have seemed strange to the audience, but they all listened politely. Shortly after this Messiaen was released from prison and went back to France.
Messiaen was inspired by the words in the Bible where the angel says “There shall be time no longer”. These words have another meaning in relation to the music, because Messiaen does not write music with a regular number of beats in a bar. Like The Rite of Spring, the length of the bars keep changing. Messiaen had heard enough of soldiers marching to a regular one-two-three-four-one-two-three-four during the war. His rhythms in this music develop from little tiny rhythmic patterns
The work is in eight movements.
The first movement is called “Liturgie de cristal” (“Chyrstal liturgy”) and describes the birds waking up. All four instruments play this movement.
The second movement is “Vocalise, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps
“Song for the Angel who announces the end of time”. It is played by the full quartet, although the clarinet does not play in the central section.
The third movement is called “Abîme des oiseaux” (“Abyss of birds”) and is just played by the clarinet. It is extremely slow and the clarinettist needs a lot of breath control.
The fourth movement is “Intermède” (“Interlude”) and is played by the violin, cello, and clarinet.). It is fast and lively.
The fifth movement is “Louange à l'Éternité de Jésus (“Praise to the eternity of Jesus"). It is played by the cello accompanied by the piano who just plays chords. It is again extremely slow and the cellist needs good bow control.
The sixth movement is called “Danse de la fureur, pour les sept trompettes“ (“Dance of the Fury, for the seven trumpets”), played on all four instruments. They play in unison (the same notes) nearly all the way through.
The seventh movement is called “Fouillis d'arcs-en-ciel, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps" (“Tangle of rainbows, for the Angel who announces the end of time”), played by the full quartet. Some of the music from the second movement is repeated. We hear the angel being covered by the rainbow.
The eighth movement is “Louange à l'Immortalité de Jésus" (“Praise to the immortality of Jesus"), for violin and piano. We hear the ascent of man to his god. The violin finishes on a very high harmonic note.
In the long preface at the front of the score Messiaen writes a short introduction to the music theory theory of his music. He describes the rhythms he uses and how they relate to one another. However, at the end, he says that it is not necessary to read all about his theory in order to perform the piece.

National parks of New Zealand

The national parks of New Zealand are 14 protected areas that are looked after by the Department of Conservation "for the benefit, use, and enjoyment of the public". These are popular among tourists, with 30% of tourists visiting at least one national park during their stay in New Zealand. While the national parks contain some of New Zealand's most beautiful scenery, the first few that were created were all focused on mountains. Since the 1980s more different kinds of New Zealand landscapes have been included in the national parks. New Zealand's national parks are all important to preserve both nature and culture, and some are also historically important. Tongariro National Park is one of 27 World Heritage Sites that is of both cultural and natural significance, and four of the South Island national parks form Te Wahipounamu, another World Heritage Site.
The National Parks Act of 1980 was written to record what national parks are for, and how they would be chosen and looked after. It begins by explaining what a national park is:
The National Parks Act goes on to say that the public will be allowed to enter and use the parks freely, but with rules to avoid destroying the native plants and animals or the parks. Access to specially protected areas (550 km²) as noted under the act is only allowed with special permits.
National parks are soil, water and forest conservation areas, and should be kept as natural as possible. Native plants and animals are to be looked after and other plants and animals removed if they harm the natural wildlife. Development in what the act calls "wilderness areas" is only foot tracks and huts used for wild animal control or scientific research. 
The Act allows the Department of Conservation to provide hostels, huts, camping grounds, ski tows and other services, parking areas, roading and tracks within the parks. As well as these, the department also provides some accommodation, transport and other services at entry points to the parks, but these are also offered by others. Other services within the parks, such as guided walks and skiing tutorials, are provided by other companies, sometimes with help from the department.
The area around Waipoua Forest, north of Dargaville, was suggested to become a new Kauri National Park. The area contains most of New Zealand's remaining kauri, including the largest known kauri, Tāne Mahuta. These stands of kauri are also important because they are homes for many endangered species including the North Island Brown Kiwi. This proposal is currently being considered by the Department of Conservation.
In 2010 the New Zealand Government proposed removing some national park and conservation areas from Schedule 4 protection of the Crown Minerals Act which means that mining is not allowed in those areas. In July the government decided against the proposal after receiving a large number of submissions, most of which were against mining.

Rudy Rucker

Rudolf von Bitter Rucker (born March 22, 1946 in Louisville, Kentucky) is an American mathematician, computer scientist, science fiction author, and philosopher. He is one of the founders of the cyberpunk literary movement. He writes both fiction and non-fiction books and articles. He is best known for the novels in the Ware Tetralogy (series of four books). The first two books ("Software" and "Wetware") both won Philip K. Dick Awards. Now he edits the science fiction webzine called "Flurb".
Rucker is the great-great-great-grandson of the philosopher Georg Hegel.
Rucker attended St. Xavier High School. Then he completed a B.A. in mathematics from Swarthmore College. Next, earned Master's and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from Rutgers University.
He taught at the State University of New York at Geneseo from 1972–1978. He got a grant (money to support scholarship) from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, so he went to teach math at the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg from 1978–1980. He then taught at Randolph-Macon Women's College in Lynchburg, Virginia from 1980–1982. Next, he tried being as a full-time author for four years. Inspired by an interview with Stephen Wolfram, Rucker became a computer science professor at San José State University in 1986. He retired from SJSU in 2004. He is a mathematician who is also interested in philosophy. He has written books connecting these two areas, for example: "The Fourth Dimension"; "Geometry, Relativity and the Fourth Dimension"; and "Infinity and the Mind". Princeton University Press published new editions of "Infinity and the Mind" in 1995 and in 2005, both with new prefaces; the first edition is cited with fair frequency in academic literature.
As his "own alternative to cyberpunk," Rucker developed a writing style he calls Transrealism. He gave a brief explanation of Transrealism in his 1983 essay, "The Transrealist Manifesto". It is science fiction based on the author's own life and immediate perceptions, mixed with fantastic elements that symbolize psychological change. Many of Rucker's novels and short stories apply these ideas. One example of Rucker's Transrealist works is "Saucer Wisdom", a novel in which the main character is abducted by aliens. Rucker and his publisher marketed the book as non-fiction as a kind of joke.
Rucker wrote his first Transrealist novel, "White Light," while he was at Heidelberg. This Transrealist novel is based on his experiences at SUNY Geneseo.
Rucker often uses his novels to explore scientific or mathematical ideas. For example, "White Light" examines the concept of infinity. Parts of the Ware Tetralogy (written from 1982 through 2000) are an explanation of using natural selection to develop computer software (a subject also developed in his "The Hacker and the Ants", written in 1994). His novels also show a mystical philosophy. Rucker explained this philosophy in an essay called "The Central Teachings of Mysticism". There may be some irony in this tiitle (The essay is included in "Seek!", 1999).
He recently published a book called "The Lifebox, the Seashell, and the Soul: What Gnarly Computation Taught Me About Ultimate Reality, the Meaning Of Life, and How To Be Happy". This book summarizes the various philosophies he's believed over the years. It ends with the tentative conclusion that people might get some benefit by thinking about the world as made of computations. His final remark in the book is, "perhaps this universe is perfect."

Tinamou

The tinamous are a family of birds. There are 47 species of tinamou in Central and South America. They are one of the most ancient living groups of bird, and are related to the ratites. Generally ground dwelling, they are found in a range of habitats.
Of Gondwanan origin, tinamous are related to the ratites. Although the fossil record in South America is poor, the known tinamiform fossil record goes back 10 million years. Together with the ratites, they make up Palaeognathae ("old jaws"), while all other living birds are members of Neognathae ("new jaws"). Unlike the other palaeognaths, tinamous do have a keeled sternum. Like the other palaeognaths, they also have a distinctive palate (thin bony plate at top of mouth).
Recent phylogenetic studies place tinamids as the sister group of Australasian/Oceanian ratites. Those are the (cassowaries, emus, and kiwi). South American ratites (rheas) and African ratites (ostriches) are also related, but more distantly. Tinamous themselves are monophyletic.

List of Latin phrases

This page lists direct English translations of common Latin phrases, such as "veni vidi vici" and "et cetera". Some of the phrases are themselves translations of Greek phrases, as Greek rhetoric and literature were highly regarded in ancient Rome when Latin rhetoric and literature were still maturing.
Be aware that the Latin letter "i" can be used as either a vowel or a consonant. When used as a consonant, it is often replaced by the letter "j", which was originally simply an orthographic "long i" that was used in initial positions and when it occurred between two other vowels. This medieval convention is most commonly preserved in Latin legal terminology–hence phrases like "de iure" are often spelled "de jure". On this list, the more common form will be the one a phrase is listed under: thus, "de jure" is used instead of "de iure", and "alea iacta est" instead of "alea jacta est".

Musette

Musette is the French word for small bellows played bagpipes. Some composers liked to use a drone (especially one in fifths) to make it sound like bagpipes or other folk instruments. Johann Sebastian Bach, François Couperin and other Baroque composers often called such pieces "Musette". Sometimes they did this in orchestral music: Joseph Haydn used a drone in the last part of his Symphony No. 104 to accompany a folk tune.

Gram-Schmidt process

The Gram-Schmidt process is a way of converting one set of vectors that forms a basis into another, more friendly one.
Suppose we have a set of vectors formula_1 that form a basis for formula_2, and that we wish to convert these into a friendly basis. We begin by finding out which component of a vector is being unfriendly to a second vector, which we may do with inner products. If we have two vectors formula_3, then we may find the component of formula_4 being unfriendly to formula_5 with formula_6. By subtracting this from formula_5, we get the component friendly to formula_4. By returning to our abstract set formula_1, we may make use of this observation to construct a general algorithm to convert an arbitrary basis into a friendly basis. Like from our original set, each time we use the process on a new vector, it is guaranteed to be mutually friendly with all the previous vectors.
Define:
formula_10 = formula_11
formula_12 = formula_13
et cetera, with the general term:
formula_14
Should we wish to make this a friendly and cute basis, we can simply make each new element of the basis cute, by replacing both formula_15 with formula_16.

Pigeonhole principle

The pigeonhole principle explains that when there are (n) pigeon-sized holes in a pigeon container, then it's impossible to fit more than (n) pigeons in that container, without having at least one hole containing more than one. The pigeons are used here as an example for anything that can be put into containers or subdivisions.
This theorem is important in computer science and mathematics, especially in graph theory.
In one suitcase there are 12 blue socks and 18 black socks. If we close our eyes, how many socks must we pull out to be sure we have a pair the same color?
If we think of the colors as 'holes' or categories, we have 2 holes, so (n) = 2. If we pull three socks from the suitcase, at least two of them must be the same color, because 3 is a number greater than 2. So the correct answer here is three.

Vehicle insurance

Vehicle insurance (also called auto insurance or car insurance) is a kind of insurance that protects people if they have a car accident. Somebody with vehicle insurance would not have to pay the entire cost of damage a car accident causes. In many places, it is against the law to drive without vehicle insurance.
Somebody with vehicle insurance would pay what is called a "premium" (perhaps every month). The insurance company would decide how big the premium is, and might consider several factors. These include some of the following: 
When you pay a premium, the insurance company agrees to pay your losses as outlined in your policy. Depending on different factors, the insurance company may not pay all or any of your losses.

Umbrella insurance

Umbrella insurance protects all items of economic value and future income. It is also known as a type of liability insurance. A liability is a legal debt or obligation. The umbrella refers to how the policy shields insured assets. It covers damages caused by you and your dependents. People who have large sums of money usually have this type of insurance because they have high premiums .Premiums are the total cost of the policy.It guarantees you higher liability limits. It provides additional limits of coverage if you are at risk of being sued.
The umbrella policy is there to fill the gaps in other insurance policies. Where one policy does not cover the umbrella policy picks up where it doesn’t cover. The umbrella policy covers all insurances such as house, car, etc. The umbrella policy covers in increments of 1,000,000 dollars. So if you had car insurance that only covered 200,000 dollars, the coverage would then be 1,200,000 dollars. The same goes for home owners insurance if you had 500,000 dollars in coverage the total coverage would become 1,500,000 dollars in coverage.

<doc id="265122" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=265122" title="Argument from false premises">
Argument from false premises

An argument from false premises is a line of reasoning which can lead to wrong results. A false premise is an untrue proposition that forms part of the basis of a "logical syllogism". Since the premise (assumption) is not correct, the conclusion drawn may also be wrong. However, whether or not an argument is "valid" depends on whether it is consistent, not whether its premises are true.
For example, consider this syllogism:
This argument is logically valid, but not always true, because the first premise can be false – someone could have hosed down the streets, a street cleaner could have passed, the local river could have flooded, and so on. A simple logical analysis will not reveal the error in this argument, since that analysis assumes that all the argument's premises are true. For this reason, an argument based on false premises can be much more difficult to refute, or even discuss, than one featuring a normal logical error, as the truth of its premises must be established to the satisfaction of all parties.
Another feature of an argument based on false premises that can bedevil critics, is that its conclusion can in fact be true. Consider the above example again. It may well be that it has recently rained, and that the streets are wet. This of course does nothing to prove the first premise, but can make its claims more difficult to refute.
A false premise can also be a premise that is poorly defined, which makes the conclusion questionable. The following joke from "Plato and a Platypus Walk Into a Bar" illustrates the point: "An old cowboy goes into a bar and orders a drink. As he sits there sipping his whiskey, a young lady sits down next to him. ... She says, 'I'm a lesbian. I spend my whole day thinking about women. ...' A little while later, a couple sits down next to the old cowboy and asks him, 'Are you a real cowboy?' He replies, 'I always thought I was, but I just found out I'm a lesbian'." The mistake the cowboy makes is that he assumes that the definition of a lesbian is somebody who spends the "whole day thinking about women", without including the fact that a lesbian is a homosexual female. The cowboy is neither homosexual nor female; therefore, he is not a lesbian.

Goodluck Jonathan

Jonathan's term as President of Nigeria ended on 29 May 2015, when he handed over to President Muhammadu Buhari.
Jonathan was born in Otueke in Ogbia Local Government Area in Nigeria to a family of canoe makers. He has a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Zoology. He also holds an M.Sc. in Hydrobiology/Fisheries biology, and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Zoology from the University of Port Harcourt. After he got his degree, he worked as an education inspector, lecturer, and environmental-protection officer, until he decided to become a politician in 1998.
Jonathan is married to Patience Faka Jonathan and has two children. Jonathan is a member of the Ijaw ethnic group.
Jonathan began his career in politics in 1998, having joined the People's Democratic Party (PDP) in 1998.
Jonathan, who had been the Deputy Governor of Bayelsa State, succeeded Governor Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, who was impeached by the Bayelsa State Assembly after being charged with money laundering in the United Kingdom. In September 2006, Jonathan's wife was indicted by the nation's anti-crime agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), for crimes related to money laundering.
In December 2006, Jonathan was chosen as running mate to Umaru Yar'Adua for the PDP presidential ticket in the April 2007 election. On 20 April 2007, shortly before the presidential election, there was a violent attack from militants. The police said that people had tried to kill Jonathan. However, this did not end up happening.
Following the PDP's election win, which some people did not think was fair, militants blew up Jonathan's country house in Otu-Eke, Bayelsa State on 16 May; two policemen were killed in the attack. Jonathan was not there at the time.
President Umaru Yar'Adua left Nigeria on 23 November 2009 for medical treatment. He did not make plans for anyone to take over his duties. On 13 January 2010, a federal court handed Vice-President Jonathan the power to carry out state affairs in the president's continued absence. On 22 January 2010, the Supreme Court of Nigeria ruled that the Federal Executive Council (FEC) had 14 days to decide whether President Yar'Adua "is incapable of discharging the functions of his office".
In a nationwide address in February 2010, Jonathan called on all Nigerians to set aside religious and ethnic differences to work together for the common good.
Jonathan said "The events of the recent past have put to a test our collective resolve as a democratic nation,"
"I am delighted to know that our nation has demonstrated resilience and unity of purpose.
On 9 February 2010, the Senate decided that presidential power should be given to the Vice President. He was appointed to serve as Acting President, with all the accompanying powers, until when and if Yar'Adua returned to full health. The power transfer was called a "coup without the word" by opposition lawyers and lawmakers. The Nigerian Constitution requires a written letter from the President stating he is unable to serve or that the cabinet sends a medical team to examine him but this provision has not apparently been fulfilled leaving some doubts as to the constitutionality of the action.
Yar'Adua died on 5 May 2010. Jonathan was sworn in as Yar'Adua's replacement on 6 May 2010, becoming Nigeria's 14th Head of State. He will serve as President until the next election. Upon taking office, Jonathan cited anti-corruption, power and electoral reform were what he wanted to focus on as President. He stated that he came to office under "very sad and unusual circumstances."
On 18 May 2010, the National Assembly approved President Goodluck Jonathan's nomination of former Kaduna State governor, Namadi Sambo, an architect, for the position of Vice President.
After the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, in which the Nigerian side failed to advance beyond group stage, Jonathan said that the national team could no longer play international matches. FIFA objected to the president's decision and threatened to kick Nigeria out of the association. After this, Jonathan ended the ban.
Jonathan was re-elected in April 2011 in an election that some experts said may have been the most fair election in Nigerian history.

Nicaraguan Sign Language

Idioma de Signos Nicaragüense, or Nicaraguan Sign Language, is a sign language that was spontaneously invented by deaf schoolchildren in Nicaragua in the 1970s and 1980s. The language developed when the Sandinist government of Nicaragua created the first (elementary) school for deaf people, in the 1970s. The language is of special interest to linguists, because it allows them to study how languages develop.
In the 1970s, the deaf people of Nicaragua rarely met. They lived isolated lives and used simple gestures to communicate with their friends and family. In 1977, a special programme for the deaf was started in a suburb of Managua. At first, fifty children took part. When the Sandinist came to power, the number of pupils rose to hundred. In 1980, a vocational school for deaf people was opened in another part of Managua. In 1983, both schools together had about 400 pupils.
The teaching was centered on lip reading and the use of a hand alphabet. This was mostly unsuccessful, because most pupils had trouble spelling words in this way. The children were cut off from their teachers, and used recreational breaks, and free time spent together to create a system that allowed them to communicate with each other. Gestures and signs used at home were used to create a pidgin. Later the pidgin developed into a Creole language. The first step, that is to say the pidgin is called "Lenguaje de Signos Nicaragüense" (LSN) today. Pupils who left the school before the creole language was created, continue to use the pidgin.
The staff of the school missed the fact that a language was developing before their eyes. All they saw were some mimics, and the failure to learn Spanish. As they did not know what the pupils were saying, they asked for help. In 1986, Judi Kegl, an expert on the topic of American Sign Language was asked to help. When she analysed the language, she found out that the pidgin NSL had been made more complex by the younger pupils — it now included a fixed grammar, and the arrangement of verbs. Today, this extended form is known as "ISN".

Lee Fogolin, Sr.

Lidio John Fogolin, Sr. (born February 27, 1926 in Fort William, Ontario - d. November 29, 2000) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player for the Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Black Hawks of the NHL.
Lee Fogolin started his professional career with the Omaha Knights of the USHL in 1946. The next year he played for the Indianapolis Capitals of the AHL. He saw his first NHL action for the Detroit Red Wings in the 1948 playoffs. He began the 1949 season with Indianapolis before being called up to the NHL full-time.
He played the next 3 seasons with Detroit winning the Stanley Cup with them in 1950. In 1951 he was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks along with Steve Black for Bert Olmstead and Vic Stasiuk. He played the final 6 years of his career on less than impressive Chicago Black Hawks teams. In 1957 he signed on as a player-coach of the Calgary Stampeders of the WHL. He broke his elbow that season and decided to retire at its conclusion to concentrate on coaching full-time.
Lee Fogolin coached 1 season in the WHL in 1957. He did not return to coaching until 1971 with the Thunder Bay Twins of the USHL where he stayed for 2 seasons.

Toner

Toner is a powder commonly used in photocopiers and Laser printers to draw images and text onto paper. The early forms of toner were just carbon powder.
In early machines, the user had to pour the toner into a reservoir on the machine itself. Current machines feed from a sealed cartridge which is normally a proprietary design. Although manufacturers try to make the process complicated, empty cartridges are sometimes refilled by third-party vendors.
Toner particles are melted by the heat of the fuser, and bind to the paper.
Since toner is a fine dust, it can remain in the air for a long time, and is considered to have health effects similar to inert dust.
It can be very painful to people with respiratory conditions such as asthma or bronchitis.
Many companies selling laser printers will also provide a way to return empty toner cartridges. These are commonly re-used, with new toner. Today, many toners have chilps which tell the printer how much toner is left. These chips also need to be re-programmed, when the toner is re-filled.

Three Choirs Festival

The Three Choirs Festival is a festival of classical music which is held every year in August. The choirs from three cathedrals take part in many of the concerts. The three cathedrals are: Hereford Cathedral, Gloucester Cathedral and Worcester Cathedral. Each year the festival is held in one of those three cathedrals in turn.
The Three Choirs Festival is one of the oldest festivals of classical music. It has its roots in the 18th century. Many famous musicians have performed in the festival. Concerts have been conducted by Samuel Sebastian Wesley, Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams and many others. Music has been composed for the festival by Frederick Delius, Zoltan Kodaly Holst, Arthur Sullivan, Herbert Howells, Gerald Finzi, William Walton, Arthur Bliss and Benjamin Britten, Lennox Berkeley, John McCabe, William Mathias, Paul Patterson and James MacMillan. As well as the cathedral choirs there is also a choir called the Festival Chorus which takes part, usually singing large-scale works with orchestra. Many ensembles and international soloists perform at the festival.

Worcester Cathedral

Worcester Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral in Worcester, England. It stands on a bank overlooking the River Severn. It is the seat of the Anglican Bishop of Worcester. Its official name is The Cathedral Church of Christ and the Blessed Mary the Virgin of Worcester. It was built between 1084 and 1504, so therefore there are many different kinds of architecture, from Norman to Perpendicular Gothic. It is famous for its Norman crypt and the unusual chapter house.
The Cathedral was founded in 680 with Bishop Bosel as its head. Most of the cathedral we see today dates from the 12th and 13th centuries.
Monks and nuns had been at the Cathedral since the seventh century. The monastery became Benedictine in the second half of the tenth century. The Benedictine monks were driven out in 1540 and replaced by secular (non-religious) canons.
After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the building became a cathedral of secular clergy again. The cathedral often had restoration work done, especially by Sir George Gilbert Scott and A. E. Perkins in the 1860s. Both men are buried at the cathedral.
In the chancel of the cathedral is the tomb of King John. The cathedral has a memorial, Prince Arthur's Chantry, to the young prince Arthur Tudor, who is buried here. Arthur's younger brother and next in line for the throne was Henry VIII. Worcester Cathedral was not destroyed by Henry VIII during the English Reformation because of his brother's chantry in the cathedral.
Other famous burials include Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin (1867–1947), Bishop of Worcester John Gauden (1605–1662) and Richard Edes (d.1604), a chaplain to Elizabeth I and James I.
The tower has a ring of twelve bells plus three semitone bells and a non-swinging bourdon. They are some of the most beautiful church bells ever made. There is a teaching centre with eight special training bells, linked to computers.
Worcester Cathedral has three choirs: the Worcester Cathedral Choir (the main choir which has both a boys' and a girls' treble line, which normally work separately), Worcester Cathedral Chamber Choir, and the Worcester Cathedral Voluntary Choir. Since the 18th century, Worcester Cathedral Choir has taken part in the Three Choirs Festival, the oldest music festival in the world.
The composer Edward Elgar spent most of his life in Worcestershire. The first performance of his Enigma Variations took place at the cathedral during the 1899 festival. There is a stained glass window which contains his portrait.
Worcester Cathedral has a long history of organs dating back to at least 1417. Until recently there was a large four-manual organ, originally built by Hope Jones. Most of this organ was removed in 2006 in order to make way for a new instrument by Kenneth Tickell, which was completed in the summer of 2008.
Famous organists at Worcester have included Thomas Tomkins (from 1596), Hugh Blair (from 1895), Ivor Atkins (from 1897) and David Willcocks (from 1950). Today the organist (from 1996) is Adrian Lucas.

Formula One racing

A Formula One race event is an automobile race using open wheel cars. The race takes place over an entire weekend. There are two practice sessions on Friday. On Saturday, there in one more practice session and then the qualifying session. The race itself takes place on Sunday. 
Formula One races are run under the rules and control of the FIA. Typically, a FIA support series, such as the GP2 Series, also runs during the weekend.
All days of the week and times given are local. 
The event usually begins on Friday with two practice sessions. The first session, called Practice 1, runs from 10:00 to 11:30. The second session, called Practice 2, rums from 14:00 to 15:30 (or 2:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. in the 12-hour clock). 
The practice sessions allow the drivers to learn the circuit and the teams to test their cars. Teams may test new parts on their cars. The car's wings and suspension settings may be changed to make the car faster. The teams may also allow one of their test drivers to drive the practice session.
The practice sessions have become more important starting in . With the FIA ban on testing during the season, the Friday sessions are the only time a team has to test new car parts.
The last practice session, called Practice 3, takes place on Saturday from 11:00 to 12:00. This allows the teams a final tune-up before qualifying starts.
The Monaco Grand Prix has a special schedule. The practice sessions the normally take place on Friday are moved to Thursday. The F1 teams do not have any sessions scheduled on Friday.
The Singapore Grand Prix is the only night race in the Formula One calendar. Because of this, the session times are changed. Practice 1 runs from 18:00 to 19:30, and practice 2 runs from 21:30 to 23:00. The practice 3 session runs from 19:00 to 20:00.
On Saturday at 14:00 (22:00 for Singapore) the qualifying session takes place. This session will determine the running order at the beginning of the race. This is often called "setting the grid". The qualifying session is split into three parts, called Q1, Q2, and Q3. Q1 is 20 minutes long, followed by seven minute break. Q2 is 15 minutes long, followed by an eight minute break. Q3 is 10 minutes long. During each part of qualifying, the fastest lap time set by a car is recorded. Drivers may run as many or as few laps as they wish.
After Q1 is complete, the eight slowest cars are eliminated (removed from) the qualifying session. This would include any cars that did not set a qualifying time. The remaining 18 car advance (move on to) Q2. The eight cars eliminated are placed in the last eight start positions, based on their fastest time from Q1. The procedure is repeated for Q2. The eight slowest cars from Q2 are placed in the 11 through 18 starting positions on the grid.
The top ten cars remain for Q3. After this final part of qualifying, the top ten starting positions on the grid are set. The fastest qualifier is placed in the first position, which is known as the pole position. This car will have an advantage at the start, because they do not need to follow any other cars.
Generally, a driver will leave the pits and drive around the track back to the start/finish line. This is called the "out-lap", and is not a timed lap. This lap often starts out out at a slower pace to warm up the tyres. They will be up to full speed by the time they reach the start line. When they cross the line, they will try to drive the quickest time they can around the circuit. This is called a "flying lap" or a "hot lap". A driver may run several hot laps in a row. The fastest of these hot laps is used in setting the grid position. Finally, the driver will slow down and drive around the track. They re-enter the pit-lane on this "in-lap". If there is still time left, they may put on fresh tyres and try to set a faster hot lap. 
In the past, there were more cars entered for each race than the track had available space. When this would happen, not all cars would qualify. The slowest cars would not able to race and would be list as "Did not Qualify" (DNQ) in race results.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s the number of cars attempting to enter each race was as high as 39. It was too dangerous to have that many cars on the track at the same time. A "pre-qualifying" session was used. The teams with the worst record over the last six months would need to pre-qualify. This including all new teams. Only the four fastest cars from this session were then allowed to the main qualifying session. The slowest cars from the pre-qualifying session were listed in race results as "Did Not Pre-Qualify" (DNPQ). Pre-qualifying was ended after when many of the small teams left the sport.
As the number of cars entered fell below 26, a new problem started. All cars entered would automatically qualify for the race. Some cars were much slower than most of the other cars. The 107% rule was introduced in . If the qualifying time of a car was not within 107% of the pole time, the car would not qualify for the race. For example, if the pole time was 1m 30s, the slowest a car could go to qualify would be 1m 36s. The race stewards could allow a slow car to race if they thought there was a good reason for it being slow. For example, rain may have slowed down the qualifying session.
rule returned for the F1 season.
The race itself is held on Sunday afternoon (Sunday night at Singapore). Thirty minutes before to race time, the cars take to the track. They may run several warm-up laps if they wish. When they are ready, they line up on the starting grid in the order they qualified. At race time, a green turns on to start the formation lap. The formation lap is a slow lap around the circuit. The cars warm up the engines and tyres, and all systems are checked. The cars return to their assigned grid spot and stop. The start is called a "standing start". 
The starting light system is a set of five red lights mounted above the start/finish line. The red lights turn on one at a time, until all five red lights are on. Then there is a short delay of several seconds. Then the red lights turn off the race starts. The delay is different each time to keep the drivers from guessing when the race will start.
The length of the race is at least 305 kilometers. The fewest laps needed to race at least 305 km is determined for each circuit. The one race that is different is Monaco. There, the race is set at 78 laps for 206.5 km.
The time of the race can not exceed two hours. After two hours, the race is ended the next time the lead car passes the finish line. The race can also be stopped short of the full distance for safety reasons if conditions are bad.
Any time the car needs to be serviced, the driver must make a pit stop. The pit lane is next to the main straight with the start/finish line. The driver must enter the pit lane using the marked entrance road and slow down. Once they car enters the pit lane, the driver must not drive faster than the pit lane speed limit. If they do, they will receive a penalty. The driver stops the car in the team's pit box. Each team has one pit box to service both of their cars. After the work is done, the driver reenters the pit lane. At the end of the pit lane, they enter pit exit road. Hear they speed up the car to race speed. The driver may not reenter the race circuit until they leave the exit road.
Teams are supplied with tyres from Pirelli. They receive two different types of slick (tyres that have no tread) dry weather tyre compounds. The prime tyres and the option tyre. The prime tyre is made from harder rubber and will last longer. The option tyre is made from softer rubber. It will provide more traction in the corners, but will not last as long as the prime tyre. Each car is required to use at least one set of prime and one set of option tyres during the race.
The drivers who qualify in the first ten positions must start the race with the same tyres they qualified on. The remaining drivers may start the race on the tyre of their choice.
Teams are supplied with two different types of wet weather tyres. The intermediate and wet tyre. Intermediate tyres are used when the track surface is damp or during a light rain. Wet tyres (sometimes called "full wets" tyres) are used when the track surface is very wet.
Whenever wet weather tyres are used, the requirement to use both types of dry tyres is dropped. 
Teams are no longer allowed to refuel their cars during the race. The cars must start the race with enough fuel to complete the full race distance. 
In the past, refueling was allowed. The amount of fuel a team would add to the car was part of the race strategy. Less fuel would make the car lighter so it would go faster. But more pit stops would be required to add fuel.
When the leader completes the last lap of the race, and crosses the finish line, the race ends. Any remaining cars on the circuit race to the finish line and complete they lap they are on. If they are also on the lead lap, they are scored as being so many seconds behind the leader. If they are not on the lead lap, they are scored as being so many laps behind the leader. Any cars not still running are normally scored as "retired" (Ret). If they have completed 90% of the race distance, they scored with a finishing position.
The first three finishing positions are called a "podium finish" The three drivers take their places on a podium. They stand as the national anthem of the race winner's home country and that of his team are played. Dignitaries from the country hosting the race then present trophies to the drivers. A constructor's trophy is presented to a representative from the winner's team.
Points are awarded to drivers and teams based on their finishing order. The winner receives 25 points, the second place finisher 18 points, with 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 and 1 points for positions 3 through 10. If a race is stopped 75% of the scheduled race distance has been completed, the points awarded are cut in half. If two or more drivers tie for a position, prizes and points are added together and shared equally for all those drivers who tie. Constructors receive points as well as drivers. Each constructor receives the same amount of points that their two drivers earned. 
The winner of the annual Driver's Championship is the driver with the most points. The same hold true for the Constructors' Championship. If two or more drivers (or constructors) have the same number of points, a tie breaker system is used. The one with the most wins is ranked higher. If the number of wins are the same, it goes to the one with the most second places and so on.
In the past, other point systems were used. Also, there were not a many races during the season as today. In the early years, there were seasons with as few as seven races. When F1 started in , only eight points were awarded to the winner. For the first decade of F1, an additional point was awarded for the fastest lap. For many years, only the best number of results would count toward the championship. 
In Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna were the drivers for McLaren. They were the best two drivers of that year. There were 16 races that year, but only the best 11 results counted towards the championship. Prost won seven races and finished seventh races in second place. He scored a total of 105 points, but only 87 of them counted for the championship. Senna won eight races and finished second in three, giving him 90 points for the championship and 94 for the season. This resulted in the strange event where Prost took a record number of points, yet Senna won the champion.

The quadrivium consisted of four which were related to mathematics:
These four studies compose the secondary part of the curriculum outlined by Plato in "The Republic". 
All the education was done in Latin, which educated pupils learnt at school, or from a private tutor. Latin was the "lingua franca" (universal language) of mediaeval Europe: even the Bible could only be read in Latin. Since the quadrivium was taught in universities, only boys could take it (because only males took part in universities). The teaching was done by priests. If girls wanted education, it had to be done in their homes. In the modern form of liberal arts in the United States, both sexes are taught, although there are still a few single-sex institutions.

Croke Park () is a stadium. It is the biggest stadium in Ireland. It is in the middle of Dublin. It is the third largest stadium in Europe. It can hold 82,300 people. The stadium is owned by the GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association), Ireland´s biggest sport organisation. Since 1884 it is used by the GAA. The annual finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and Senior Hurling Championship are held here Music concerts by major international acts have also been held. From 2007–2009 it was also used for rugby and soccer. The stadium is named after Thomas Croke, an archbishop, who was an early mentor of the GAA.
The area was used since 1870 as sports ground. It was called Jones's Road Sportsground. Since the foundation of the Gaelic Athletic Association it was used for major events in Gaelic sports. In 1913 the ground was bought by them. At this time the ground had one stand and earth walls around the field. In the 1920s the capacity raised by building new stands. In the 1980s the GAA decided to build a high capacity stadium. The final constructions were in 2003.
During the Irish War of Independence on November 21, 1920 Croke Park was the scene of a massacre by the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC). The police shoot into a crowd which was visiting a Dublin-Tipperary Gaelic football match. The dead included 13 spectators and Tipperary's captain, Michael Hogan. To his memory the new stand of 1924 was named "Hogan stand".

Iron(III) nitrate

Iron(III) nitrate, also known as ferric nitrate, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Fe(NO). It contains iron in its +3 oxidation state. It also contains nitrate ions.
Iron(III) nitrate is a light purple solid. It dissolves easily in water. It is an oxidizing agent. It is acidic. It absorbs water easily to make a hydrate (chemical with water molecules attached to it). 
It is made by reacting iron or iron(III) oxide with nitric acid. The reaction of iron with nitric acid makes nitrogen dioxide. Nitrogen dioxide is toxic and brown.
It is used to etch silver alloys. It is also used to make sodium amide. It acts as a catalyst in this reaction.
It can be mixed with clay to make an oxidant clay. This oxidant clay can be used to make organic molecules. 
Iron(III) nitrate is oxidizing, so it can catch things on fire. It is also corrosive to metal and can burn skin.

<doc id="265415" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=265415" title="Beau Brummell">
Beau Brummell

Beau Brummell, (born George Bryan Brummell, London 7 June 1778 – died Caen, France 30 March 1840), was the leader of men's fashion in Regency England. He was a friend of the Prince Regent, the future King George IV, and started the fashion for men to wear tailored clothes that were tasteful and fitted well.
Brummell once said: "If John Bull turns around to look at you, you are not well dressed; but either too stiff, too tight, or too fashionable". This hardly suggests a dandy whose cravats alone were a peacock display.
No doubt Brummell wore various styles, but one in particular seems to have been his favourite. The style included dark coats and full-length trousers, with an elaborately-knotted cravat. 
The coat was cut away at the front, and double-breasted. If worn open, it had a double-breasted waistcoat underneath. The tails of the coat were not long, ending above the back of the knees. They were cut square. The collar of the coat was a 'stand-up': it stood higher at the back of the neck.
Beau Brummell is credited with introducing and establishing as fashion the modern man's suit, worn with a tie. The modern tie is a descendant of the cravat. 
It is said that Brummell believed in cut rather than colour. In the illustration his clothes are well-fitted, but also quite colourful by our standards. 
He claimed to take five hours to dress. He recommended using champagne to clean boots and make them shine. His style of dress is often referred to as dandyism, Brummell would not have agreed with that description.
Brummell's personal grooming was very modern. He kept himself clean, which most people did not in his day. 
This kind of care is quite modern, and a part of celebrity culture today. He was a perfectionist in his choice of clothes. There's a story of someone who visited him, and met his valet coming out of the room carrying a tray full of cravats. "These, Sir, are our failures"! said the valet. Brummell said of himself "I have no talents other than to dress; my genius is in the wearing of clothes".
His father died in 1794, leaving him an inheritance of more than £20,000 pounds. He was educated at Eton and at Oriel College, Oxford University. He later joined the 10th Hussars, where he came to the attention of George, Prince of Wales. Through the influence of the Prince, Brummell was promoted to captain by 1796. When his regiment was sent from London to Manchester he resigned his commission.
For a time, Brummell avoided extravagance and gambling. For example, he kept horses but no carriages. He was included in Prince George's circle. Here, he made an impression with his elegant manner of dress, and his clever remarks. His attention to cleaning his teeth, shaving and bathing daily became popular. 
However he did spend money on his appearance. When asked how much it would cost to keep a single man in clothes, he was alleged to have replied: "Why, with tolerable economy, I think it might be done with £800".
Brummell was influenced by his wealthy friends. He began spending and gambling as though his fortune were as great as theirs. This was not a problem while he could still get credit, but that did not last. Brummel could borrow money based on his closeness to the Prince. But in 1811, the Prince became Regent and began abandoning all his old Whig friends.
Brummell, Lord Alvanley, Henry Mildmay and Henry Pierrepoint were the prime movers of "Watier's", called "the Dandy Club" by Byron. They were also the four hosts of the masquerade ball in July 1813. There an event occurred which ruined Brummel. The Prince Regent greeted Alvanley and Pierrepoint, but then "cut" Brummell and Mildmay by snubbing them, staring them in the face but not speaking to them. This provoked Brummell's remark, which became famous: "Alvanley, who's your fat friend?". This widened the rift between them. 
Normally, the loss of royal favour to a favourite was doom, but Brummell had the approval and friendship of other leading people. He became a favourite without a patron, still in charge of fashion and courted by large segments of society.
However, his debts spun out of control and, when he tried to recover by various schemes, that only dug the hole deeper. In 1816, he fled to France to escape debtor's prison. Payment was demanded of thousands of pounds sterling owed by him. Usually, Brummell's gambling debts, as "debts of honour", were always paid immediately. The one exception to this was the final wager recorded for him in White's betting book. Recorded March, 1815, the debt was marked "not paid, 20th January, 1816". 
He lived the remainder of his life in France. In the reign of William IV he got an appointment at Caen by the influence of Lord Alvanley and the Marquess of Worcester. This gave him a small annuity. His final comment to a visiting friend was "My wallpaper and I are fighting a battle to the death. One of us has to go!" He died penniless and insane from strokes in Caen in 1840.
A statue of Brummell by Irena Sedlecka was erected on London's Jermyn Street in 2002.

John Nash (architect)

John Nash (18 January 1752 – 13 May 1835) was an English architect responsible for much of the layout of Regency London. He was the most important architect of the period 1800 to 1830.
Nash was born in Lambeth. He studied architecture as an apprentice to Sir Robert Taylor for nine years.
From 1810, Nash would take very few private commissions. He was a dedicated Whig and was a friend of Charles James Fox, who was Foreign Secretary in 1806. Perhaps through Fox, Nash came to the attention of the Prince Regent (later King George IV). For the rest of his career he would largely work for the Prince. His first major commissions in 1811 from the Prince was Regent Street and the development of an area then known as Marylebone Park. 
With the Regent's backing Nash created a master plan for the area, put into action from 1818 onwards, which stretched from St James’s northwards and included Regent Street, Regent's Park and its neighbouring streets, terraces and crescents of elegant town houses and villas. Nash did not complete all the detailed designs himself; in some instances, completion was left in the hands of other architects. Nash was employed by the Prince to develop his Ocean Pavilion Palace in Brighton, originally designed by Henry Holland. By 1822 Nash had finished his work on the Ocean Pavilion, which was now transformed into the Royal Pavilion.
Examples of his work include:

Right to education

The right to education is one of the human rights, but it is not used by everyone. The right should make everyone equal and help to end discrimination. It is thought that all children should go to school for primary education from the age of six years, to the age of ten years. During this time, children usually learn reading and writing skills in their mother tongue (first language), as well as some easy mathematics, social studies and science. 
Furthermore, all children should have access to secondary education, and higher education. However, many children around the world cannot or do not go to secondary education or higher education. 
The right to education is written in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 14 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The right to education has also been re-stated in the 1960 UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education, 1st Protocol of ECHR and the 1981 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
It is also listed in the European Convention on Human Rights, Protocol 1, Article 2. Some national constitutions name this right, for example the Belgian constitution (former article 17, now article 24) or the .

Global Hunger Index

The Global Hunger Index is a measurement to measure the hunger situation in a country. It is a Statistical tool. There are three numbers which are used to calculate the GHI. Each number has the same importance:
To get the World Hunger index, the weighted average of the three numbers is taken. This number will be between 0 and 100. Higher numbers are worse. The numbers can be interpreted as follows:
Today, the highest values can be found in Africa south of the Sahara, and in South Asia, with values of 22.1, and 23.0. Even though the numbers may be similar, the source of the problem is different. In Sub-saharan Africa the main problem is high child mortality rates, and a large number of people who cannot meet their energy requirements. In South Asia, the main problem is the high number of malnurished children under the age of five. This may also be a consequence of the fact that women have a poorer education, and baby girls are not fed as well as baby boys.

GP2 Series

The GP2 Series, GP2 for short, is a form of open wheel motor racing. GP2 was started in 2005 after the Formula 3000 was stopped. The format was conceived by Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore, while Ecclestone also has the rights to the name GP1. In 2010 the GP3 Series class was launched, as a feeder class for the GP2 series.
GP2 was designed to be an affordable racing series and a training series for Formula One. GP2 requires all of the teams to use the same chassis, engine and tyre supplier. Almost all races have taken place as support races on Formula One race weekends. Many drivers have used GP2 as a stepping stone into Formula One.
The GP2 Series car is used by all of the teams, and features a Dallara chassis powered by a V8 Renault engine and Bridgestone tyres.
The 4 L Renault V8 engine features design and software upgrades designed to improve performance and fuel consumption. The engine produces about 620 bhp (432.5 kW). GP2 Series engines are rev-limited to 10,000 rpm.
Bridgestone supplying three slick tyre compounds for racing on dry (soft, medium and hard). They also provide a wet weather tyre. The choice of tyre to be raced is made by the Bridgestone and the GP2 Series organizers prior to each event.
Brembo supplies the brakes.
On Friday, drivers have a 30-minute practice session and a 30-minute qualifying session. The qualifying session decides the grid order for Saturday's race which has a length of 180 kilometers.
During Saturday's race, each driver has to make a pit stop in which at least two tyres have to be changed.
On Sunday there is a sprint race of 120 km. The grid is decided by the Saturday result with top 8 being reversed, so the driver who finished 8th on Saturday will start from pole position and the winner will start from 8th place.
2005-2011
With this points system, the most number of points anyone can score in one round is 20 by claiming pole position, winning both races with the fastest lap in each race. This has only been achieved twice in GP2 Racing's short history. By Brazilian Nelson Piquet, Jr. in the 9th round of the 2006 season in Hungary and by German Nico Hülkenberg in the 5th round of the 2009 season in Germany.
2012-present
The top eight finishers in a sprint race receive points as follows:
Drivers are listed by their last year in GP2 Series. Usually they started in F1 at the start of the following season.
Note: Timo Glock had four Grand Prix starts in 2004, drove in GP2 Series in 2006-07 before moving to F1 in 2008.

Formula Two

Formula Two, often called F2, is a type of open wheel auto racing. It served as a feeder series to Formula One. In 1985 it was replaced by Formula 3000. In 2008 the FIA announced that Formula Two would return for 2009 season in the form of the FIA Formula Two Championship. The goal is to develop a low-cost series to allow young drivers a chance to compete in the highest levels of motor racing.
Formula One is generally regarded as the top open-wheeled auto racing series. Because of the high performance and expense of the cars, a lower level racing series was needed for developing drivers and teams. For much of the history of F1, Formula Two was that step in the racing ladder.
Before the Second World War, there was a division of racing cars smaller and less powerful than the Grand Prix racers. This division was usually called voiturette ("small car") racing. It provided a place for amateur or less experienced drivers and smaller team to prove themselves.
In 1946, Formula A (later known at Formula 1) was introduced. The old 1.5 L voiturette formula was replaced with 3.0 L supercharged cars.
Formula Two (first known as Formula B) was first formally defined in 1948 by the FIA as a smaller and cheaper racers to complement to the Grand Prix cars of the era.
The engines 2.0 L normally aspirated or 750 cc supercharged. The 750 cc engines were rarely used. This brought new manufactures, such as Cooper to move up to Formula Two. Formula One in its early years was very expensive. There were so few cars entered for the 1952 and 1953 that the World Championship Grand Prix races were run to Formula Two rules.
F2 started to decline with the arrival of the 2.5 L Formula One in 1954. A new format of Formula Two was introduced for 1957 with 1.5 L engines. This became dominated by rear-engined Coopers and "Bobtail" sports car. Porsches cars based on their RSK sports cars enjoying some success. Ferrari originally developed their 'Sharknose' Dino 156 as an F2 car. The dominant engine was the Coventry-Climax FPF four cylinder.
Formula Junior was introduced in 1959. It tried to replace F3 and F2. It was realised that it needed to be split up. F2 and F3 were reintroduced for the 1964 season. F2 cars had a 1.0 L engine. Many F1 stars drove in the F2 series on their "off-days". 
By the late 1960s, many felt the gap between F1 and F2 too wide. A new 1.6 L production-based engine formula for F2 was introduced. This brought the series back to a feeder series for F1. The most popular engine was the Cosworth FVA. 
In 1967, the FIA introduced the European Formula Two Championship. Jacky Ickx, driving a Matra MS5, won the first championship. 
In 1972, the formula was changed to increase power. 2.0 L production-based engines were allowed. Cosworth BDs and BMW four-cylinder engines dominated the early years. BMW-powered Marches slowly gained the lead. For 1976, race only engines were permitted.
After the 1984 season, Formula Two was upgraded to Formula 3000. This was an attempt to merge F2-style chassis with the normally-aspirated 3000cc Cosworth DFV V8 engines. These engines were now obsolete in the all-turbocharged Formula One.
F3000 was replaced by the GP2 Series in 2005. To save money, standard 4000cc V8 engines are used. They provided 580 hp at low a cost. 
The Formula Two name returned in 2009, following an FIA announcement on 25 June 2008.
MotorSport Vision (MSV) won the contract to supply chassis and engines for the new FIA Formula Two Championship. MSV is also the promoter of the Championship as well as the operating entity for all of the cars.
The cars were designed by Williams Grand Prix Engineering Ltd and prepared by MotorSport Vision (MSV). The open wheel chassis is powered by a 1.8L turbocharged Audi engine developed by Mountune Racing. The new F2 cars are aimed to fall between F1 and F3 in performance. MSV, owned by former Formula One driver, Jonathan Palmer. The first championship was won by Andy Soucek. The season was marred by the death of Henry Surtees during Round 4 at Brands Hatch.
A number of other Formula Two series have existed around the world. They include Japanese Formula Two (now known as Formula Nippon), Australian Formula 2 (since 1964). Other national Formula Two series include Mexican, Brazilian, Argentina, and South American. The British Formula 3000 series was briefly known as Formula Two.

Kazuki Nakajima

Nakajima was born in Okazaki, Aichi, Japan. He is the son of the retired Formula One driver Satoru Nakajima. His younger brother, Daisuke, is also a racing driver.
Nakajima started his career in racing in 1996, when he started karting. His father had been backed by Toyota's arch-rivals Honda through his career. Nakajima hoped that by joining Toyota he would shield himself against any claims that his father had promoted his career.
In 2002, Nakajima won a scholarship in Formula Toyota, which he became champion in a year later. He progressed onto Japanese Formula Three in 2004, winning two of the 20 races and finishing fifth in the Drivers' Championship. Nakajima stayed in Japanese Formula Three for 2005, finishing second. He also raced in the Japanese GT300 sports car series, where he ended the year eighth.
Nakajima moved to the Formula Three Euroseries in 2006. He finished seventh with 36 points.
In November 2006, Nakajima was named a Williams test driver for the 2007 season. Nakajima's debut in a Formula One car came at Fuji Speedway during November 2006, where he completed four demonstration laps in wet conditions.
Nakajima raced in the GP2 series in 2007 for the DAMS team. Nakajima also served as Williams' test driver, completing 7,000 km of testing for the team.
Nakajima's first year in GP2 finished with no wins, but five consecutive podiums and ended the year as top rookie.
It was announced on 9 October 2007 that following the retirement of Alexander Wurz, Nakajima would race for Williams in the season finale in Brazilian Grand Prix. Nakajima finished tenth in the race. He set the fifth fastest lap – quicker than his team-mate Nico Rosberg, who finished fourth. 
On 7 November it was confirmed by Williams that Nakajima would partner Rosberg at the Williams team for the season. He had a successful start to 2008 at the Australian Grand Prix. He finishing seventh but promoted to sixth after Rubens Barrichello was disqualified. He then finished seventh in the Spanish Grand Prix. Nakajima scored two points at Monaco. He was the first Japanese Formula One driver to scored a point at Monaco. Nakajima scored again at the British Grand Prix. In Singapore, Nakajima made it to the third qualifying round for the first time. He qualifyed 10th and finish eighth and scored a point.
Nakajima was retained by Williams for the season. At the Australian Grand Prix he crashed into the wall at turn six, putting him out of the race. Nakajima also retired at Bahrain. He crashed two laps from the end of the Monaco Grand Prix whilst running in 10th place. At the British Grand Prix, Nakajima qualifying in an fifth place, hi highest starting spot. Nakajima finished the season without scoring a single point.
Williams signed Rubens Barrichello and Nico Hülkenberg for 2010, leaving Nakajima without a seat. Stefan GP announced on 19 February 2010 that Nakajima was one of the team's drivers. Strefan GP was built from the remains of the Toyota F1 team. Toyota had withdrawn from F1 in late 2009. Stefan GP did not have an entry to the 2010 Formula One season. The FIA ruled that Stefan GP could not be entered for the season at such a late stage. That left Nakajima with no ride in Formula One for 2010.

The word Rhe-nock (in Lepcha dialect) means Black Hill. Situated in the extreme east of Sikkim, Rhenock witnessed the establishment of first police out post in the state, which is the historical event.
Rhenock was covered with dense forest in and around the 13th century. The Lepchas were the early settlers about six to five hundred years ago. After the Lepchas, Bhutias settled in the villages presently known as Kyongsa, Aritar & Chalisey. The people who settled here after 16th century were mostly from Nepali ethnic group such as Newars, Bahuns (Adhikari, Paudel, Gautam, Dahal, Bhandari and Achaarja), Chhetri (Subedi, Khatiwada & Bista), Gurung, Rai and Limboo.

Oystercatcher

The Oystercatcher is a species of bird that lives around Europe and Asia. They usually eat shellfishes that are found on beaches and mud. The Eurasian Oystercatcher uses its sharp bill to open the shells of oysters and mussels. It cuts the muscle between the two halves of the shell together, or it crashes the shell against a rock and eats the oyster inside.
The oystercatcher has the heaviest bill (= beak) of any living wader. They have "resource polymorphism": they have some different beak types, and each type is used for a different kind of feeding. Unusually, the polymorphism is not genetically determined. It seems individuals are able to change their beak to suit their food. They do, of course, inherit an ability to adapt their feeding behaviour.
"Stabbers" work by jabbing their bill tips between the valves of a mussel's shell. "Hammerers" open mussel shells by banging down on them; some hammerers only break the dorsal side, others only break the ventral side. Still others feed on worms, and they have narrow, tweezer-like bill tips.
The bird's bills grow at 0.4 mm per day, which is four times as fast as human fingernails. Individuals forced to switch from mussel-eating to worm-eating were able to change their bill shape in 10 days.
With bills like that, oystercatchers are dangerous opponents for other birds. They can fight off predators, and often raid other birds to steal their catches. "They attack other birds at an average of five-minute intervals during low tide". They get as much as 60% of their food by theft.
Oystercatchers may live to 35 years.

Kart racing

Kart racing or karting is a type of open-wheel motor sport. It uses small, open, four-wheeled vehicles called karts, go-karts, or gearbox/shifter karts depending on the design. They are usually raced on scaled-down kart circuits. Karting is commonly seen as the stepping stone to the higher and more expensive ranks of motorsports.
Karts vary widely in speed. Some known as Superkarts can reach speeds exceeding . Go-karts for the general public used for fun may be limited to speeds of . 
Art Ingels is generally accepted to be the father of karting. He was a long time hot rodder and a race car builder at Kurtis Kraft. He built the first kart in Southern California in 1956. 
The chassis are made of steel tube. There is no suspension. The chassis must flex enough to work as the suspension. 
Braking is achieved by a disc brake mounted on the rear axle. Front disc brakes are becoming popular. Some classes do not allow them.
Amusement park go-karts can be powered by 4-stroke engines or electric motors. Racing karts use small 2-stroke or 4-stroke engines.
Karts do not have a differential. Both rear wheels turn at the same speed. Because of this, one rear tire must slide while cornering. 
Power is transmitted from the engine to the rear axle by way of a chain.
Wheels and tires are much smaller than those used on a normal car. 
Like other motorsports, karts use different tires for the track conditions. Slicks are used for dry weather. Rain tires or "wets" are used for wet weather. Slicks with grooves cut into them are used for dirt tracks. Spiked tires are used for ice. 
Kart racing is generally accepted as the most economic form of motorsport available. As a fun pastime, it can be performed by almost anybody. As a motorsport, it is regulated by FIA (under the name of Commission Internationale de Karting (CIK).
In the USA, many organizations regulate racing, such as the International Kart Federation (IKF), World Karting Association (WKA), Karters of America Racing Triad (KART), and Stars of Karting presented by the Indy Racing League. In the UK, the Motor Sports Association (MSA) regulate Karting. In Australia, kart racing is administered by the Australian Karting Association on the behalf of FIA and Confederation of Australian Motor Sport (CAMS).
Kart racing is usually used as a low-cost and relatively safe way to introduce drivers to motor racing. Many people think it is for young drivers, but adults are also very active in karting. Karting is considered a first step in a racer's career. It can help develop quick reflexes, precision car control, and decision-making skills. 
Besides traditional kart racing, many commercial enterprises offer karts for rent, often called "recreational" or "concession" karts. The tracks can be indoor or outdoor. Karts are rented by sessions (10 to 15 minutes usually), they use sturdy chassis completed with bodywork for driver safety. 
Outdoor tracks can offer low speed karts strictly for amusement, or faster, more powerful karts similar to a racing kart. Typically, these outdoor tracks may also be used for traditional kart races.

The Black-headed Weaver, also known as the Village Weaver, is a bird with a black head and golden body. The male Black-headed Weaver usually does the weaving, however, and the female sits for the eggs. The male stitches strips of straws to make a basket with a roof. He uses grasses to tie knots and make sure the nest is completely secure. Finally, he shows the nest to females, in effort to attract a mate. The males usually mate with many females during the mating season to get more offspring. They all nest in colonies, and in the end the females are left to raise their young alone. The seeds that the Black-headed Weaver tends to feed on is very common, so they do not need to stay and defend their family's territory or food.

The Messier Catalogue is a list of astronomical objects made by French astronomer Charles Messier in 1771. Messier was a comet hunter, and was annoyed by objects which were not comets. He put together a list of these objects, with his assistant Pierre Méchain.
The list is still used by astronomers, mainly because they are very familiar with it.
The objects have 'M' in front. He was limited by the objects he could see from France so the list is incomplete by today's standards but it remains popular due to the length of time it has been around and astronomers' familiarity with these objects.
The first edition covered 45 objects numbered M1 to M45. The total list published by Messier finally contained 103 objects, and the list was made up to 110 by modern astronomers working from Messier's notes.. 
Other catalogues exist, most notably the New General Catalogue.
Almost all the items are either star clusters or nebulae. There are only three galaxies in the first fifty, starting with Andromeda at M31. Individual stars are not listed. The first ten in the list are:
M1 NGC 1952 Crab nebula, a supernova remnant
M2 NGC 7089 a globular cluster

Barium sulfide

Barium sulfide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is BaS. It contains barium and sulfide ions.
Barium sulfide is colorless when pure. It can get colored when it is not pure. It reacts slowly with water to make barium hydroxide and hydrogen sulfide. It reacts with acids to make a barium salt and hydrogen sulfide, too.
It is made by reduction of barium sulfate with carbon at a high temperature. 
It is used to make barium compounds from barium ore.
Barium sulfide looks very similar to barium sulfate. Barium sulfate is not toxic, while barium sulfide is very toxic. Barium sulfide dissolves in water to make toxic hydrogen sulfide and toxic barium hydroxide. If someone is fed barium sulfide, it would kill them.

Plasmodium

Plasmodium, commonly known as the malaria parasite, is a large genus of parasitic protozoa. There are about 200 species. Infection with these protozoans is called malaria, a deadly disease widespread in the tropics. The parasite always has two hosts in its life cycle: a mosquito vector and a vertebrate host.
The life-cycle is very complex. There is a sequence of different stages in the vector and the host. These stages include: 
The genus "Plasmodium" was first described in 1885. At least ten species infect humans. Other species infect other animals, including birds, reptiles and rodents, while 29 species infect non-human primates. The Apicomplexa – the phylum to which "Plasmodium" belongs – are thought to have originated within the Dinoflagellates – a large group of photosynthetic protozoa.
The most common forms of human malaria are caused by "Plasmodium falciparum", "Plasmodium vivax", "Plasmodium ovale", and "Plasmodium malariae". "P. falciparum" malaria, common in sub-Saharan Africa, is especially dangerous.

Barium peroxide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is BaO. It contains barium and peroxide ions.
Barium peroxide is a gray-white solid. It reacts with water to make oxygen gas. When it is heated very hot, it releases oxygen and turns into barium oxide. 
It is made by heating barium oxide. This process used to be used to get oxygen from the air. Barium oxide was heated to around 300°C, absorbing oxygen and making barium peroxide. The barium peroxide was heated above 500°C, releasing the oxygen. Then it could be reused.
Barium peroxide can be used to make hydrogen peroxide by reaction with sulfuric acid. This also makes the solid barium sulfate.

If it is heated in nitric oxide, it makes barium nitrite. It reacts with any sulfate or sulfuric acid to make barium sulfate.
It is made by reacting barium carbonate with nitric acid. It can also be prepared by reacting the solutions of sodium nitrate with barium chloride.
Barium nitrate can be mixed with powdered aluminium and zinc. This makes an explosive. It is also used in fireworks to make a green color. It is also used to make barium oxide.
Barium nitrate is very toxic. Sulfates can be given if someone eats barium, because they turn it into nontoxic barium sulfate.

Barium hydroxide

Barium hydroxide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Ba(OH). It contains barium and hydroxide ions.
Barium hydroxide is a white solid. It dissolves in water to make a basic solution. It decomposes to barium oxide when heated in a vacuum. It reacts with carbon dioxide to make barium carbonate. It reacts with any sulfate to make barium sulfate. It reacts with hydrogen sulfide to make barium sulfide.
It is made by dissolving barium oxide in water.
Barium hydroxide is used in titrations. If sodium hydroxide solution is used, some sodium carbonate may be in there. It is less basic than sodium hydroxide, so the titration can be messed up. When barium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide to make barium carbonate, it forms a white solid that can be removed.
It is used as a strong base in organic chemistry. It is used to clean up sulfuric acid spills by making barium sulfate. It can also be used for removing ink marks from clothes.
Barium hydroxide is corrosive because it is basic. It is also toxic because of barium ions.

Barium carbonate

Barium carbonate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is BaCO. It contains barium and carbonate ions.
Barium carbonate is a white solid. It does not dissolve in water. It reacts with acids to make barium salts. It turns into barium oxide and carbon dioxide when heated. It reacts with sulfuric acid to make barium sulfate though.
Barium carbonate occurs as witherite. Witherite is the main source of barium salts. It is more easily turned into other barium compounds than barium sulfate, barite. It is heavily mined in Northumberland. It turns into barium sulfate when water containing sulfates flows through it.
It can be purified from the natural ore, or it can be made by reacting barium sulfide with sodium carbonate. It can also be made by reacting barium sulfide with a mixture of carbon dioxide and water.
Barium carbonate is used to poison rats. It is also used in making bricks. It is also used to glaze ceramics. This glaze can make different colors.
Barium carbonate can dissolve in stomach acid, so it is toxic. There is a controversy over whether it should be used as a glaze.

Barry Goldwater

Barry Morris Goldwater (January 2, 1909 - May 29, 1998) was a conservative politician from the United States. He represented Arizona in the United States Senate. 
He ran for President of the United States in 1964 against Lyndon B. Johnson. He did not win. Goldwater was a member of the Republican Party. He was a Freemason. He wrote "The Conscience of a Conservative". He was born in Phoenix, Arizona. He was a commentator on the Cable News Network (CNN) in its early years.
Goldwater died from a stroke in Paradise Valley, Arizona, aged 89. He was suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
Goldwater was called "Mr. Conservative" during his political career. He was a Senator from Arizona. In 1960, he wrote "The Conscience of a Conservative". The book was a best seller. In 1964, he was the Republican candidate for President. He ran against Lyndon Johnson. Goldwater's most famous quote (which he said in July 1964 in San Francisco) was "Extremism in the Defense of Liberty is no vice, and Moderation in the Pursuit of Justice is no virtue." He meant that people should always do what was necessary to make the world freer and more just even if it was hard or made them unpopular. Goldwater lost to Johnson by a large number of votes.
Goldwater went back to the Senate after losing the election. His run for president helped start the conservative movement of today, which agrees with many of Goldwater's ideas. He didn't agree with the social conservatives who were against abortion and gay rights. Goldwater stayed in the Senate until 1987. He helped Sandra Day O'Connor get on the Supreme Court. He passed a military reform law. Goldwater retired to Arizona after being in the Senate. He died in Arizona in 1998.
Goldwater enjoyed photography, airplanes, and radio. He collected Native American Kachina Dolls, which are made by the Native Americans of Arizona. He donated his collection to a museum. Goldwater had four children.

Chris Ivory

Chris Ivory (born March 22, 1988) is an American football running back for the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League. He was signed as a free agent by the Saints on May 3, 2010. He played college football at Washington State and at Tiffin University in Ohio.
Ivory played both football and track and field in high school at Longview High School in Longview, Texas.
Ivory played three years for Washington State. Because of injuries, he did not get to play as much as he could have. In 22 games, he rushed 91 times for 534 yards and 4 touchdowns. He also had 23 kickoff returns, averaging 22.8 yards. In August 2009, Ivory was kicked off the Washington State team.
Ivory then went to Tiffin, a Division II school in Tiffin, Ohio, whose team was coached by Dave Walkosky. Walkosky had been a Washington State assistant coach. In Ivory's final year of college football, he had 39 rushes for 223 yards in five games before hurting his knee, which ended his season. Walkosky tried to get a medical redshirt exemption for Ivory, which would have let Ivory play another year, but he did not get one. Even though he did not play much at Tiffin, some NFL scouts saw Ivory's performance and speed, and some people thought he could become the first Tiffin player to be picked in the NFL Draft. However, this did not happen.
Ivory was not drafted, but he reached a deal with the Saints immediately after the draft, and signed as a free agent on May 3, 2010. He played well in training camp and preseason games. This included a good game against the San Diego Chargers that included a 76-yard touchdown on a swing pass. Chris Ivory made the Saints 53 man roster after beating out Ladell Betts for the last running back position with a great preseason performance.

Ad Council

The Advertising Council, mostly called the Ad Council, is an American non-profit organization that creates public service announcements on behalf of sponsors, including non-profit organizations and the United States government.
The Advertising Council does not make public service advertisements for itself but it acts as a creator of them for others. The Advertising Council allows sponsor organizations to create advertising that are on social issues as well.
The Advertising Council was created in 1941, and shortly after, in February 1942, it was registered as The War Advertising Council for the purpose of being in the advertising industry in support of the Second World War effort. Early ads tried to tell people about the purchase of war bonds and saving of war things.
After the Second World War, the War Advertising Council changed its name to the Advertising Council and shifted its focus to peacetime ads. In 1945, the Ad Council began working with the National Safety Council.

Jean Piaget

Jean Piaget (9 August 1896 - 16 September 1980) was a Swiss developmental psychologist. He is famous for his work with children and how they learn. He started a type of study called "genetic epistemology", which is about where knowledge comes from.
At first, Piaget was a biologist. He was especially interested in mollusks. He became more interested in psychology while listening to children talk. He wondered how they learned, and came up with a theory that they go through stages where they become ready for certain kinds of learning. These stages are called "stages of cognitive development". For example, the first stage he came up with is called the "sensorimotor stage". He believed that, from birth to two years old, children would learn that they are different from objects, and that even if the child left a room, things that were in the room would still be there. (This is called "object permanence").

Shikoku

Shikoku (四国) is one of Japan's four main islands. It is the smallest island. 
The island lies southeast of Honshu and northwest of Kyūshū across the Kanmon Strait. 
Farming is a very important business in Shikoku. Citrus fruits are an important product. Shikoku is the home of the 88 Temple Pilgrimage of the Shingon sect of Buddhism.
Shikoku region covers the entire island.
The name Shikoku literally means "four countries" in Japanese. Shikoku was made of four old "countries" or provinces that are now prefectures. In other words, each prefecture has a modern name and an old provincial name. The old names are still used sometimes, especially for foods, music, or art. 
There are twelve original castles left in Japan and Shikoku is home to four of them. 
The 88 Temple Pilgrimage is a famous but difficult 1,647-kilometer circle around the entire island. Serious pilgrims may choose to complete the 88 Temple Circuit on foot. Other people uses buses.

Wikipedia:AutoEd

AutoEd is a script that helps to automatically make certain changes in articles, and also allows for easy design, use, and customization of user scripts related to automated article cleanup. It is based on , , and , but allows for further customization and the easier creation of new functions. It is currently maintained by and over at the English Wikipedia any changes there will be made here thereafter.
It is VERY easy to install AutoEd and you don't need a shred of technical ability! If you can follow a recipe for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you can install this script. Instructions are below. If you get anxious, .
This script can aid in making edits by using regular expressions to replace certain lines of text (typically errors) in articles with other, correct lines of text. The main setup creates a single tab at the top of the page entitled "auto ed". Clicking this tab will open the editform (if it isn't already open) and run the script, making various fixes depending on what modules you are using, and finally clicking the "diff" button so that you can see the changes. Right now the modules are very limited and customization isn't fully implemented, but the presets described below present an easy way to use the script without needing to know JavaScript or understanding the technical details of the script.
 will contain details on how to customize this script and create new modules and presets. It is not yet completed, but currently contains some basic information about variables and choosing your own modules which may be useful.
AutoEd is also compatible with . For it to function properly, however, you need to add the following to skin's .js page. This disables the diff page from opening automatically, but at this time is required in order for AutoEd's changes to be made correctly in WikiEd.
Although each user can customize AutoEd to fit their personal tastes, and can even use its core coding to help build other scripts, AutoEd has a number of "preset" customizations which can be used without any knowledge of JavaScript. So far the "basic", "wikichecker", "formatter", and "complete" presets have been created, although what they do will continue to expand and more presets can be created by any user or upon request.
To install a preset, just add the code given in each section to and purge your cache by following the instructions on that page. The script should then be installed and ready for use; if it doesn't seem to be working, please mention this on so that we can try to fix it.
The "basic" preset serves to cleanup various problems with wikitext, headlines, templates, and ISBNs.
Once installed, the "auto ed" tab should appear on all non-talk pages. Clicking it will run the following fixes:
If you want, you can view the code for this preset at 
This preset is designed to function as a replacement for the , and it includes most all of the functions of that script, plus a few more.

Spiral galaxy

A spiral galaxy is a kind of galaxy that looks like a flat, slowly rotating disk with a bulge in the centre. It contains stars, gas, dust, dark matter and a supermassive black hole at its centre. 
Galaxies were first listed in the 18th century by William Herschel. The spiral galaxy as a type was first described by Edwin Hubble in his 1936 work "The Realm of the Nebulae". They are named after their shape. The spiral arms are where young, hot stars are made, which is why they are brighter than the center of the galaxy. Some spiral galaxies have yellow, 'fossil' arms of older stars. 
The barred spiral galaxy is an important and common type of spiral galaxy. There are three other kinds of spiral galaxies. "Grand-design" spiral galaxies have two well-shaped arms. "Multiple-arm" spiral galaxies have more arms. In "flocculent" spiral galaxies, it is hard to see the arms at all. 
About 60% of galaxies in the universe near us (the 'local universe') are spiral and irregular galaxies. They are mostly found in low-density parts of the universe, and are rare in the centers of galaxy clusters.
Our own Milky Way has recently (in the 1990s) been confirmed to be a barred spiral galaxy, although the bar itself is difficult to observe from our position in the Galactic disk. The most convincing evidence for its existence comes from a recent survey, performed by the Spitzer Space Telescope, of stars in the Galactic center.

Wikipedia:AutoEd/Customization

AutoEd features a number of built in "variables" which you can change for your own use. To change the variables, just copy the following into your monobook.js page, where you should also have the "basic" preset imported (some of the other presets have set variables already, so changing some variables in conjunction with using non-basic presets could cause errors. To avoid this, you may want to consider either creating your own preset or defining the script's main function manually, both of which will be described below).
Each of these variables is described below. The first two variables are "boolean"; they can be set to either true or false, and nothing else. The next three are strings; you can change the text within the string to anything you'd like, just remember to leave the quotation marks in. The final variable is a little more complicated; see the description below for details. If you'd like, you can remove the entire line for each variable that you don't change from the defaults listed above.
Remember in each case to leave the semicolon at the end; otherwise the script won't work.
Although the length of this section may make it look complicated, selecting your own modules (sets of automatically-made changes) is actually pretty easy. The presets provide an easy way to quickly start the script, but you can pick and choose what change you want to have the script make easily, and you can even use your own, new modules.
When using this form of customization to select your own modules, please do "not" also import one of the presets; this could cause a malfunction. Instead, you can look at the code used in the presets to determine what modules are needed to duplicate their effects.
Generally, you add this code to . If you think that your code is different enough from the presets that other users may want to have it as an easy-to-use selection, you can instead create the preset separately at , replacing "nameofpreset" with the chosen name.
These instructions are set up in the order the code should be added to whatever page you are putting it on, so you can just go through it one step at a time.
"Any" use of AutoEd requires that be imported for use, because this defines the set of core functions needed to make the script work... things like creating the "auto ed" tab, defining the default parameters for variables, and adding text to the edit summary. To do so, simply add the following text:
Note: If you are creating your script somewhere other than in your userspace, you need to put the text
Note: If you are creating the script somewhere other than in your userspace, also add the following after everything else.
If this is a bit too confusing, please feel free to ask for help or clarification at , and one of the script's maintainers should be able to help you out. Alternatively, you can look at the code used in presets to see their format, which should be pretty similar to what you create here. One preset which contains everything discussed here, including variables different from the defaults, can be seen at . Looking at that code may be able to help you figure out how to write yours.

Terry Buck

Terrence William "Terry" Buck was an Australian swimmer and coach. He represented Australia at the 1964 Summer Olympics in the 400m individual medley and placed eighth. He was the first Australian swimmer to participate at the Olympics as both an athlete and a coach. He was head coach in the 1984 Summer Olympics, and team manager in 1992 and 1996. Buck was also a surf lifesaver and a life member of the Clovelly Surf Club in New South Wales. He died in a tractor accident on his farm, leaving behind his wife Laraine and three daughters.
In 2003, Greg Rogers filed a civil lawsuit against Buck. He claimed that Buck had sexually abused him from 1960 when Rogers was 11 and Buck was 16. He also said that his younger brother, Neil, was sexually abused from when he was eight. This was settled outside court. After Buck died, the Telegraph published an interview with an anonymous "Olympic and Commonwealth medalist" who said that he had been abused by Buck as a child. The person who was interviewed was not named, but many knew it was Rogers. Police had begun private investigations into the matter in 1998, but stopped the investigation in 2001, saying that it did not have enough proof. His wife said that the stories were all untrue. She said that she had "trusted" Rogers, who had been the godfather of their late daughter, Sarah, and that having "looked at it from every angle, I can say with certainty in my they are lies."

<doc id="265802" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=265802" title="Edwin Hubble">
Edwin Hubble

Edwin Powell Hubble (November 20, 1889 – September 28, 1953) was an American astronomer. Hubble's findings changed the scientific view of the universe. 
In 1925 he showed that there are galaxies beyond our own, the Milky Way. Also, he developed a method for classifying galaxies.
Then he proved the galaxies were moving away from each other. Hubble found the degree of Doppler effect (redshift) from a galaxy increased in proportion to its distance from Earth. Doppler effect is the change in pitch or colour when an object or sound comes in (higher pitch, brighter color) or moves away (lower and darker). Redshift is observed in the light spectrum 
In 1929 Hubble formulated what is called Hubble's law. The law states that the greater the distance between any two galaxies, the greater their relative speed of separation. Georges Lemaître, a Belgian priest and astronomer, had published the idea two years before in an obscure journal. Nevertheless, the idea bears Hubble's name to this day.
Today, the 'apparent velocities' of galaxies are understood as an increase in proper distance which occurs due to the expansion of space. Light traveling through stretching space experiences a Hubble-type redshift.
This work helped to establish that the universe is expanding. Some have incorrectly said that Hubble discovered the Doppler shift in the spectra of galaxies, but this had already been observed earlier by Vesto Slipher, whose data Hubble used.
The Hubble Space Telescope was named for Hubble.
According to Sandage, Hubble achieved four main things:
Hubble himself did not see his 1929 data as evidence for an expanding Universe. Even six years later, Hubble wrote:
Hubble's words were forgotten, and the notion of the expansion of the universe became the consensus. Until the theoretical developments in the 1980s no one had an explanation for why this seemed to be the case. The question "why is the universe expanding?" is now answered by understanding the details of what happened in the first inflationary epoch (10 seconds) of the existence of our universe.

Star Wars: TIE Fighter

Star Wars: TIE Fighter is a space flight simulator game that came out in 1994. It takes place in the "Star Wars" universe and has starfighters and other spacecraft from the movies and books. The player flies starfighters for the Galactic Empire in various missions.
"TIE Fighter" takes place in several parts with different storylines. In early missions the player fights against members of the Rebel Alliance, as well as space pirates and other enemies. There is also a story section where the player helps the Empire mediate between two groups that have been at war but say they want a peace treaty.
Later in the game, the player helps find out about a plot by a traitor Admiral to leave the Empire and join the Rebellion, and steal Imperial ships and technology. The rest of the game is about the player working with the Empire to stop the traitors.
In "TIE Fighter", the player is a starfighter pilot who flies in combat missions. The game is normally played in first person from the view of the cockpit, but the player can also choose third person camera. There are many starfighters the player can fly, but some can not be used until later in the game. For many missions the player can choose which starfighter to fly and what warheads to use during the mission.
Most missions are combat missions. The player fights enemy starfighters, as well as "capital ships", which are very large starcraft that are hard to destroy. Different missions have different goals. Sometimes the player will escort supplies, scan other spacecraft, or simply hunt enemy ships.
Since the game is in space there is no gravity and the player can fly in any direction. Each starfighter the player can use has laser guns and many have warheads and rechargeable shields.

Indianapolis Motor Speedway

The Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) is in Speedway, Indiana (an enclave suburb of Indianapolis) in the United States. It is the home of the Indianapolis 500 race and the Brickyard 400 race.
It was built in 1909. It is the original "Speedway", the first racing facility to use the word Speedway. IMS has permanent seating for more than 257,000 people. The infield raises capacity to approximately 400,000. It is the largest and highest-capacity sporting facility in the world.
The Speedway is considered relatively flat by American standards but high-banked by Europeans. It is a two and a half mile, nearly rectangular oval. Each of the four turns are 1/4 mile. Two 5/8 mile long straight connect turns 2 to 3 and turns 4 to 1. Two 1/8 mile short straights, termed "short chutes", connect turns 1 to 2 and turns 3 to 4.
A modern infield road course was constructed between 1998 and 2000. It used part of the oval and the infield to create a track. In 2008, the road course was changed to add another infield section. This is used for motorcycle racing, and is a course. 
On the grounds of the Speedway is the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum, which opened in 1956. It is also the home of the Brickyard Crossing Golf Resort, which originally opened as the Speedway Golf Course in 1929.
Indianapolis Motor Speedway was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987. 
In addition to the Indianapolis 500, the Speedway also hosts NASCAR's Brickyard 400. The Speedway also hosted the United States Grand Prix for Formula One from 2000 to 2007. In 2008, the Speedway added the Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix.
After winning his fifth United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis in , Formula One driver Michael Schumacher holds the record for most victories with the Forumula One version of the road course. A.J. Foyt, Al Unser and Rick Mears each won the Indianapolis 500 four times on the traditional oval. Jeff Gordon has also won four times on the oval in the Brickyard 400. Johnny Aitken holds the record for total wins at the track, with 15 victories (all on the oval), during the 1909, 1910 and 1916 seasons.
The first motorsports event at the track consisted of 7 motorcycle races, sanctioned by the Federation of American Motorcyclists (FAM), on August 14, 1909. 
The first weekend of automobile races took place August 19–21, 1909. It was 16 races sanctioned by the American Automobile Association (AAA). The event almost turned into a disaster because of the surface of crushed stone and tar. There were several accidents and five fatalities. The final race of the weekend was halted after of its originally-scheduled 300 miles.
Carl G. Fisher, was an Indiana native, and both a former race car driver and one of the owners of the track. He led the work to make the track safer for the drivers and spectators. The track surface was paved with 3.2 million paving bricks. This gave the track its popular nickname "The Brickyard". Today, (one yard) of the original bricks remain at the start/finish line., still giving meaning to the 'brick yard'. The final brick added to the roadway was a gold plated brick and laid by Governor Thomas R. Marshall on December 17, 1909.
The Speedway reopened in 1910. Sixty-six automobile races held during three holiday weekends (Memorial Day, Fourth of July and Labor Day). Each weekend featured two or three races of to distance. Several shorter contests were also held. Each race was its own event and earned its own trophy. All races were sanctioned by the AAA. In 1911, a change in marketing focus led to holding only one race per year.
An estimated 80,000 spectators came to the first Indianapolis 500 Mile Race on Memorial Day May 30, 1911. Admission was one dollar. Ray Harroun won the race at the average speed of 74.602 mph (120.060 km/h).
The next five Indianapolis 500 were held from 1912–1916. Three of the Indy 500 winners were Europeans. These races drew worldwide attention to the Speedway. More international drivers began to enter.
The 1916 race was shortened to 120 laps for . Several things caused the race to be shortened . There was a lack of entries from Europe and a lack of oil. Another reason was out of respect for the war in Europe.
On September 9, 1916, the Speedway hosted a day of short racing events. These were called the Harvest Classic. There were three races held at 20, 50 and distances. Johnny Aitken, in a Peugeot, won all three events, his final victories at the track. After the Harvest Classic, no race other than the Indianapolis 500 to be held on the grounds for seventy-eight years.
Racing was interrupted in 1917–1918 by World War I. The facility served as a military center for repairs.
Racing resumed in 1919. Speeds quickly increased. In 1925 Peter DePaolo became the first to average 100 mph (160 km/h) for the race.
By the early 1930s, the increasing speeds began to make the track more dangerous. In the period 1931–1935 there were 15 fatalities. Part of the bricks were replaced with tarmac (a tar covered macadam or small stones). During the 1935–1936 seasons a number of changes were made. The inside wall was removed in the corners. The outside wall angle was changed to help keep cars inside the track. Hard crash helmets became required. The first yellow lights were installed around the track.
At the beginning of the 1940s, the track needed more improvement. In 1941, half of the garage area, known as "Gasoline Alley", burned down before the race. When the United States joined World War II, the 1942 race was canceled. In 1942 all auto racing was banned. The 500-Mile Race was canceled for the years 1942–1945. The track mostly abandoned during the war years. 
On November 29, 1944, three-time 500 winner Wilbur Shaw came back to do a tire test for Firestone. The test was approved by the government. Shaw found the track to be in very bad condition. The contacted the owner, Eddie Rickenbacker, and found that the Speedway was for sale. Shaw try to find a buyer that would keep the Speedway as a race track. He found Indiana businessman Tony Hulman. The Speedway was purchased on November 14, 1945. 
Major renovations and repairs were made to the Speedway. It opened in time for the 1946 race. Many improvements have been made since 1946.
The 500-Mile Race became part of the Formula One World Championship for 11 years (1950–1960). None of the regular Indy drivers raced in Formula One. Alberto Ascari from Ferrari was the only F1 driver to race in the 500 during this time.
In October 1961, the final remaining brick sections of the track were paved over with asphalt, with the exception of a distinct three-foot-wide line of bricks at the start/finish line. The "Brickyard" thus became known for its "Yard of Bricks".
From 1919 to 1993, the 500 was the only race run at the Brickyard. Tony George (Hulman's grandson) inherited the track. He brought more racing to the Speedway. NASCAR start racing in 1994 with the Brickyard 400. The International Race of Champions (IROC) event was added in 1998. The last IROC at Indy race was held in 2003.
In 2003, the Firestone Indy Lights Series, a minor league series of the Indy Racing League, started racing at the Speedway. They were the first series to race in May other than the 500 since 1910. 
In 1998, Tony George made a deal to bring Formula One back to the United States. The last time F1 raced in the US was 1991. A new Indy-based road course using part of the oval track, and part of the infield was built in two years. The first United States Grand Prix held at the Speedway was in 2000. The 2001 event reported 185,000 fans were reported in attendance. The success was even more important with the race. The race was held on September 30, 2001. It was the largest international sporting event held in the United States after September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
Unlike the oval track, the Grand Prix road course is raced in a clockwise direction. This follows the general practice of Formula One, in where most circuits run clockwise.
On July 12, 2007, it was announced that Formula One would not return to the Speedway for . Tony George said there were problems meeting the demands of Bernie Ecclestone to continue hosting the event. On May 25, 2010 it was announced that Formula One would return to the United States in 2012 at a new purpose-built track in Austin, Texas. 
In 2005, there was a big problem with some of the Formula One tires. During practice, there was a big crash at turn 13. This part of the F1 circuit is the turn 1 of the oval track. This is also the only banked corner on the F1 calendar. Michelin realized their tires could not handle the banking. They would fail after a few laps. The cars using Bridgestone tires did not have the problem.
The Michelin teams could not solve the problem. Michelin wanted to add a chicane before the turn. The FIA would not allow the track to be modify. Everyone involved tried to fix the problem right up to race. Michelin told their teams the tires were not safe to race with. 
The Michelin teams lined up on the starting grid. They drove around the track for the slow parade lap. At the end of the lap, they pulled into the pits and parked their cars. This left only the three Bridgestone teams (six race cars) to run the race. The two Ferrari cars were the only cars on the lead lap at the end of the race. 
On July 16, 2007, the Speedway announced that it would host a round of Grand Prix motorcycle racing beginning in 2008. The race was backed by Red Bull and known as the "Red Bull Indianapolis GP". This was the first motorcycle racing event at the facility since its first month of operation, in August 1909.
Modifications approved by the FIA and FIM were made to the former Formula One circuit. The new circuit now has 16 turns. The motorcycle course runs counter-clockwise, the same direction as the oval track. It bypass the banking of the oval with a new infield section inside Turn 1. Also, the double-hairpin at the Hulman Straight was replaced with traditional S-turns. The construction was finished before the opening day of the 2008 Indianapolis 500.
The city of Indianapolis has hosted a half-marathon. It includes one lap around the Speedway. 
The Speedway Golf Course has hosted a PGA Tour event and an LPGA event. A Champions Tour event was hosted there from 1994–1999.
At the 1987 Pan American Games, the speedway hosted opening ceremonies and the speed roller skating competition.
IMS will be used to host events when Indianapolis hosts Super Bowl XLVI in February 2012.

First person (video games)

In video games, first person means the player sees the game from the eyes of the character he or she is playing as. This is different than third person where the player watches what the character does from a virtual camera. The player is supposed to feel like he or she is inside the character. 
A common type of first person game is first-person shooter. In a first-person shooter the player can usually see his or her arms holding a gun or other weapon. Some games such as Call of Duty let the player look right down the sights of the gun to aim.
Many simulation games (or "sims") where the player controls a vehicle are first person. This includes most flight simulators and many racing video games. The player can often see the controls and instruments of the vehicle, such as the steering wheel and speedometer in a car or the joystick and altimeter in an airplane.

One-child policy

The one-child policy (or family planning policy) is a policy introduced in the People's Republic of China in the year 1979. After the Second World War, the Chinese population grew quickly. The policy was introduced to control population growth and says that Chinese families should only have one child. There are several exceptions to this rule.
If a couple wants to have more than one child, they must pay money to the government. In some places in China, couples were able to get a permit so they would not have to pay the fee. Because most families would not be able to afford the fee, women were often forced to have an abortion.There were severe punishments for those who had a second child. However, if the first child were to be a female, the couple to try for a second child, in hopes for a male child.
Since it was started in 1979, the policy has prevented 400 million births from happening. About 36% of the Chinese population is affected by the rule. The policy does not apply in some areas, such as Hong Kong, Macau or Tibet.
In 2015, the one-child policy was removed, and instead allowed couples to have two children for the first time in thirty years.

Dad's Army

Dad's Army is a sitcom made by the BBC which was shown on British television between 1968 and 1977. It is about a Home Guard platoon during World War II. It was very popular at the time and is still repeated. It starred several well-known British actors including Arthur Lowe, John Le Mesurier, John Laurie Bill Pertwee, and Clive Dunn.
It was written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft based partly on Jimmy Croft's experience in the Home Guard but also on the work of comedians such as Will Hay. 
The Home Guard were set up in 1940 to protect Britain in the case of invasion. Because most young men were in the regular army, Home Guard platoons were usually made up of older people. The show followed the Walmington-on-Sea platoon, led by Captain Mainwaring (pronounced "Mannering"), a bank manager who appoints himself leader. 
His platoon is made up of his posh sergeant, Wilson, elderly butcher Lance Corporal Jones, several senior citizens (Privates Godfrey and Frazer), as well as a "spiv" (Private Walker) and a mother's boy (Private Pike), as well as other men who don't say much. The humour is derived from their antics, as well as the relationship between Mainwaring and his upper-class sergeant. 
In early episodes, the humour was based on the difficulty of starting the platoon without any weapons. In later episodes, the comedy was often based on the characters. Because the platoon rarely encountered the Nazis, their enemy was usually the grumpy ARP Warden Hodges, played by Bill Pertwee.

Counter-terrorism, also spelled as counterterrorism, is work to prevent and fight against terrorism. Counter-terrorism is usually done by governments, militaries, police forces, and special counter-terrorism units.
There are many different ways to do counter-terrorism. An important goal is to stop terrorism before it happens. This is done by trying to find out about plans to commit terrorism. If the plan is discovered, sometimes the terrorists can be arrested or security can be sent to protect the target of the terrorism.
Sometimes no one finds out about the terrorist plot until it starts to happen. When this happens, police or counter-terrorist soldiers may be sent to try and stop the terrorists from completing the plan, which usually leads to combat.

History of astronomy

The history of astronomy describes the ideas of earlier civilisations. It also discusses the beginnings of modern astronomy.
The Babylonian astronomers viewed the Universe as a flat disk floating in the ocean. This forms the start for early Greek maps like those of Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus.
Greek philosophers, seeing the movement of heavenly bodies, developed models of the Universe based more on empirical evidence. The first model was proposed by Eudoxus of Cnidos. According to this model, space and time are infinite and eternal, the Earth is spherical and stationary, and all other matter is confined to rotating concentric spheres. 
This model was brought into agreement with astronomical observations by Ptolemy of Alexandria, in the second century AD. His "Syntaxis mathematica", known as the "Almagest", was translated from Greek to Arabic, and from Arabic to Latin. It was first printed in 1515, with another edition in 1528.
However, not all Greek scientists accepted the geocentric (Earth-centered) model of the Universe. The Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus thought the center of the Universe was a "central fire" around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and Planets revolved in uniform circular motion.
The Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos was the first person to propose a heliocentric (Sun-centered) model of the universe. Though the original text has been lost, a reference in Archimedes' book "The Sand Reckoner" describes Aristarchus' heliocentric theory. Archimedes wrote: (translated into English)
You King Gelon are aware the 'Universe' is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the center of which is the center of the Earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the center of the Sun and the center of the Earth. This is the common account as you have heard from astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the universe is many times greater than the 'Universe' just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun on the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the sphere of fixed stars, situated about the same center as the Sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the Earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface.
Aristarchus thus believed the stars to be very far away, and saw this as the reason why there was no visible parallax, that is, an observed movement of the stars relative to each other as the Earth moved around the Sun. The stars are in fact much farther away than was generally assumed in ancient times, which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with telescopes. The rejection of the heliocentric view was apparently quite strong, as the following passage from Plutarch suggests ("On the apparent face in the orb of the Moon"):
Cleanthes [a contemporary of Aristarchus and head of the Stoics] thought it was the duty of the Greeks to indict Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the Hearth of the universe [i.e. the Earth], . . . supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates, at the same time, about its own axis. 
The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who supported Aristarchus' heliocentric model was Seleucus of Seleucia. He was a Babylonian astronomer a century after Aristarchus. According to Plutarch, Seleucus was the first to prove the heliocentric system through reasoning, but it is not known what arguments he used. Seleucus' arguments for a heliocentric theory were probably related to the phenomenon of tides. According to Strabo (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to state that the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun.
The geocentric model was accepted in the Western world for about two thousand years, until Copernicus revived Aristarchus' theory that the sun was placed at the center of the Solar System.
As noted by Copernicus himself, the suggestion that the Earth rotates (goes round on its axis) was very old, dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC). About a century before Copernicus, Nicholas of Cusa also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, "On Learned Ignorance" (1440). 
The first empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of comets, was given by Tusi (1201–1274).
Copernicus' heliocentric model allowed the stars to be placed uniformly through the (infinite) space surrounding the planets, as first proposed by Thomas Digges in his "Perfit Description of the Caelestiall Orbes according to the most aunciente doctrine of the Pythagoreans, latelye revived by Copernicus and by Geometricall Demonstrations approved" (1576). Giordano Bruno accepted the idea that space was infinite and filled with solar systems similar to our own. n; for the publication of his various beliefs, he was burnt at the stake in Rome on 17 February 1600.
This cosmology was accepted provisionally by Isaac Newton, Christiaan Huygens and later scientists, but it had several paradoxes which were resolved only with general relativity. The first paradox was that it assumed that space and time were infinite, and that the stars in the universe had been burning forever; however, since stars are constantly radiating energy, a finite star seems inconsistent with the radiation of infinite energy. Secondly, Edmund Halley (1720) noted that an infinite space filled uniformly with stars would lead to the prediction that the nighttime sky would be as bright as the sun itself; this became known as Olbers' paradox in the 19th century. Third, Newton himself showed that an infinite space uniformly filled with matter would cause infinite forces and instabilities crushing matter inwards inwards under gravity. This instability was later clarified in 1902. 
As observations on the Solar System progressed, some basic facts appeared. All planets go round the Sun in the same direction, and their planes of revolution are very similar. Likewise, most satellites go round planets in nearly the same planes. The planets revolve around their own axes in the same sense in which they orbit the Sun. These regularities cannot be a chance coincidence. 
Many were at work trying to use the ideas of Newton and Kepler to explain the observational astronomy provided by the new, larger, telescopes. 
A significant astronomical advance of the 18th century was the realization by Thomas Wright (1711–1786) that the "fixed stars" were not scattered at random, but concentrated in what we now call the "galactic plane", our view of the Milky Way. What is even more remarkable is his idea that very faint nebulae, in which "no one star... can possibly be distinguished" might be extremely distant groups of the same kind. 
Kant (1724–1804), known today for his philosophy, made some important discoveries about the nature of the Earth's rotation. He showed the frictional resistance against tidal currents on the Earth's surface must cause a very gradual slowing of the earth's rotation. The days have grown longer as time has passed. Also, he laid out a nebular hypothesis, in which he deduced that the Solar System formed from a large cloud of gas, a nebula. Following Wright, Kant also thought the Milky Way was a large disk of stars formed from a (much larger) spinning cloud of gas. 
The greatest theoretician of the 18th century was Laplace (1749–1827), who worked on the mechanics of the planets and Solar System. His massive 5-volume work on the mechanics of the Solar System explained many of the regularities which observations had discovered. Laplace made good use of another Frenchman's mathematics: Lagrange (1736–1813). 
Laplace is also noteworthy for his nebular hypothesis of the evolution of the Solar System. As it happens, the details of Laplace's theory do not quite work out for planetary systems, but they are the basis of how we understand stars condense out of a nebula.
The 18th century was also a century of great observers. William Herschel (1738–1822), helped by his sister Caroline (1750–1848) built the biggest telescope of the day (40-foot), but did his best work on a 20-foot telescope. There were problems with the mirror of the large one. The discovery of Uranus put his career on the way: he got a salary of £200 a year as "King's Astronomer". He got a rough idea of where we are in the galaxy, and could see other spiral galaxies. He called them "island universes" like the Milky Way. Also he began to work out the motions of different stars. He discovered double stars, and published catalogues of them. Herschel's observations brought astronomy into the modern era.
The modern era of physical cosmology began in 1917, when Albert Einstein first applied his general theory of relativity to model the structure and dynamics of the universe.

Uppercut

An uppercut in boxing is a punch that usually aims for the opponent's chin and therefore it is known in the common language also as hook to the chin (for example in German: "Kinnhaken").
In the technical language one does not use the expression "hook to the chin", because as a rule one calls a "hook" a punch from the side with the lead hand and almost always the chin is the target of punches.
The uppercut is often used to start or finish a set of punches.
The uppercut is led from the region of navel in a going up move, therefore the shape of hook remains, before the fist reaches the opponent's or body. Other variants, for example in the Thai boxing, are not striked from the region of stomach. Instead, the boxer drops the fist from the cover only so long outside, as is necessary for shooting with enough force. Pulling down the fist to the stomach extends the way, increases the needed time and therefore the opponent's chance to use the open cover in his favor for a punch.
An uppercut is very best performed in the closeness, then as the distance to the opponent increases the chance to not strike him arises. An uppercut causes as a rule the biggest damage, if it reaches the opponent's chin, but also torso, nose and eyes are typical targets.
It belongs for this reason to the techniques of infight.
Almost always it concerns uppercuts of the rear hand, but there are (or there were) also boxers as Aaron Pryor and Ricardo López who outside the normal play regularly stroke a left uppercut. Michel Trabant succeeded with a left uppercut a knock-out of single punch against the fiercely attacking Marc Waelkens.
Among others, Joe Louis was known for his uppercut.

It is made by oxidation (the pulling of electrons away from) of sodium chlorite by chlorine gas.
It can also be made by reduction (giving electrons to) of sodium chlorate in an acidic solution. There are some reducing agents (chemicals that reduce another chemical) that can be used. Methanol (an alcohol), sulfur dioxide (a gas made by burning sulfur), hydrochloric acid (a common acid), or hydrogen peroxide can be used.
There are even more ways to make chlorine dioxide. Sodium chlorite can react with a mixture of sodium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid to make chlorine dioxide.
Sodium chlorite reacts with hydrochloric acid to make chlorine dioxide.
Electrolysis (the passing of an electric current through a liquid) of a chlorite solution like sodium chlorite makes chlorine dioxide.
Chlorine dioxide can explode easily. That is why it is normally made when it is needed. It is not normally packaged and sent to people that need it.
Chlorine dioxide is used to bleach wood pulp to make paper. It can also be used to disinfect water. There are some ways it is better than chlorine. It is less corrosive (breaking down other things) than chlorine and does not make as many bad things in water.
Chlorine dioxide can explode easily. It is toxic in large amounts.

A firing squad is a group of people with guns who shoot and kill a criminal who has been sentenced to death penalty. The person being shot is often blindfolded. Firing squads have often been used in the military for crimes such as desertion and cowardice. 
Few countries use firing squads anymore. Many countries have either stopped using the death penalty or switched to using lethal injection. For example, in the United States, the state of Utah used to use firing squads, but it now uses lethal injection. However, some countries, such as Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates, still use firing squads. As of 2014, 73 countries still use execution by firing squad, and is the sole method of execution in 45 different countries.

Scott Speed

Scott Andrew Speed (born January 24, 1983) is an American race car driver. He was a driver for the Toro Rosso Formula One team. He made his first F1 race start at the 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix. He was the first American to race in F1 since Michael Andretti in 1993. In 2008, Speed started racing in NASCAR. For 2009 and 2001, he drove the Red Bull Toyota Camry full time in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Speed attempted to qualify for the 2011 Indianapolis 500, but did not make the race.
Speed started kart racing at the age of 10. He moved up to Formula series in 2001. He was a champion in "US Formula Russell". He drove in both the "US Barber Formula Dodge" and "US Star Mazda Series". Speed won the 'Red Bull Driver Search' program. In 2003 he drove for the ADR team in "British Formula Three". During that year he fell ill with ulcerative colitis, a form of inflammatory bowel disease. He returned to the United States for treatment.
2004 saw two championship titles for Speed. He won the "Formula Renault 2000 Eurocup" and later "German Formula Renault". This was despite his worsening colitis. This performance earned him a drive in the first season of GP2 Series for 2005. He ended the season third place in the driver championship standings behind Nico Rosberg and Heikki Kovalainen.
At the end of 2005, Speed drove the first three races of the new A1 Grand Prix series for "A1 Team USA".
In 2005 at the Canadian Grand Prix, Speed took part as a test driver for Red Bull Racing; becoming the first American driver to participate in a Formula One event since Michael Andretti's 1993 stint. He was also the test driver for the United States Grand Prix.
After the purchase of Minardi, Red Bull Racing announced the team would become Scuderia Toro Rosso. Speed and Vitantonio Liuzzi would be the drivers for the 2006 season.
In , Speed's first race was the Bahrain Grand Prix. His best finish of the season was a ninth place at the Australian Grand Prix. He would have finished Australia in the points, but had 25 seconds added to his race time for overtaking under yellow flags. At the United States Grand Prix he qualified a career best 13th. He was taken out of the race in a first-lap collision. 
Scott Speed's season was disappointing. He had equipment breakdowns and several crashes. He spun off the circuit in wet conditions at the European Grand Prix. That turned out to be his last race for the team. After the race, it was reported that he was involved in a physical altercation with team principal Franz Tost. Tost has since denied this. Speed also said that they wanted to get rid of both him and Liuzzi. Before the next race at Hungary, the team announced that he had been replaced by Sebastian Vettel.
To get ready for racing in NASCAR, Speed raced in the Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) series. he enter several races in 2007, and a full season in 2008. He drove the Red Bull-sponsored Toyota for Eddie Sharp Racing. Speed finished 5th in the points in 2008. 
During the finale of the 2008 ARCA season, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. hit Speed and sent him into the wall. This ended Speed chance at a good finish, and possibly a Championship. After repairs, Speed intentially ran his car into Stenhouse, sending both cars into the wall. Neither driver was injured. ARCA officials parked Speed for the day.
Speed made his Craftsman Truck Series debut at Atlanta Motor Speedway on March 7, 2008. He drove the Morgan-Dollar Motorsports #46 Cheverolet truck with Red Bull sponsorship. In his second race, he recorded his first Top 10 finish at Martinsville Speedway. He won his first career race on May 30 at Dover with Bill Davis Racing in a Toyota. On Sunday October 19, 2008, Scott Speed started his first Sprint Cup Series event at Martinsville Speedway. He finished in 30th place. He finished the Cup season in the #84 Red Bull Toyota Camry for the Red Bull Racing Team.
For the 2009 Sprint Cup season, Speed's car number was changed to #82. He won his first Rookie of the Race honor at the Daytona 500. Speed won the pole for the Sam’s Town 300 in his Nationwide Series debut on February 28, 2009. He also broke the track record with a speed of 182.45 mph and a lap time of 29.42 seconds.
For the 2010 Sprint Cup season, Speed was still in the #82 car. He had a disappointing season, with only two top ten finishes. At the end of the year, Red Bull Racing release Speed from his contract. This move was to make room for the return of Brian Vickers and the addition of Kasey Kahne. Vickers was returning after heart surgery. Kahne was signed for a one-year deal.
Within two weeks of leaving Red Bull Racing (RBR), Speed filed a lawsuit against the team for breach of contract. Breach of contract means that one person or group in the contract (RBR in this case) did not do the things they should have done. Speed is asking for $6.5 million US$ in the lawsuit. Speed alleges (says) that Red Bull significantly reduced its financial commitment to Speed's race team and was unable and/or unwilling to provide [Speed] with 'supporting equipment' satisfactory for a driver of [his] skill to [be] effective [to] compete in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Speed is claiming that Red Bull did not give his race team enough money or himself good enough race cars. Without the best race cars, it is hard to race at the same level as the top teams.
On July 28, 2011, Speed place a lien on RBR's property in Mooresville, North Carolina. The lien is for the race shop and the land it sits on. A lien is a legal tool to keep RBR from selling the property. The property can be used to ensure a debt is paid. RBR purchased the property for about $3.3 million US$.
Speed attempted to qualify for the 2011 Indianapolis 500. He drove a car entered by Dragon Racing. He was having trouble finding enough speed in the car to qualify. Dragon Racing put Patrick Carpentier in the car to test it. Carpentier spun and crashed the car. Dragon did not have another car for Speed to use. Speed was unable to qualify for the race.
 Competed in less that 75% of the races. Not eligible to score championship points.
Speed currently resides in Mt. Holly, NC, where he lives with his wife Amanda Mathis.
His brother Alex currently races karts in America and is a 3 time Stars of Karting champion and a 3 time SKUSA Supernationals winner.

Robert Edwards

Sir Robert Geoffrey Edwards (27 September 1925 – 10 April 2013) was a British scientist who won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work in developing in vitro fertilisation (IVF). This method is sometimes called making "test tube babies". 
He began work on his ideas in the 1950s, and the first test tube baby, Louise Brown, was born on 25 July 1978. His research partner from 1968 was Patrick Steptoe (1913–1988). By 2010, more than 4 million babies had been born using the IVF method. 
Edwards served in the military in World War II. In 1948, after the war, Edwards went to study at the University of Wales, then to the University of Edinburgh in 1951, where he completed his PhD. His studies had been on how embyros developed in mice. He had a research position at the California Institute of Technology in 1957. In 1958 he returned to England and began work for the National Institute of Medical Research. While at the Institute he began to study human fertilisation. In 1962, he took a up a new job at the University of Glasgow, but in 1963 went to Cambridge University. In 1965 he went back to the US where he was a visiting scientist at Johns Hopkins University and later at the University of North Carolina. he returned to Cambridge and taught physiology from 1969.
While scientists had some success in fertilising rabbit eggs in a laboratory, Edwards soon discovered that the process for humans was quite different and much more complex. He spent many years studying the human egg, and how it could best be fertilised by sperm outside the body. He succeeded in fertilising an egg in 1969, but they did not develop. Patrick Steptoe was a British gynecologist who had done a lot of work using a laparoscope to investigate the ovaries. Using the laparoscope he was able to take eggs directly from the ovaries. Edwards was able to use these eggs and successfully fertilize them in a test tube, actually a cell culture dish. This discovery caused a lot of debate and discussions about whether this sort of study should be allowed to continue.
His wife was Ruth Fowler Edwards, the granddaughter of physicist Ernest Rutherford and daughter of physicist Ralph Fowler. He has 5 daughters and 12 grandchildren. 
Edwards died on 10 April 2013 after a long lung illness in England, aged 87.

<doc id="266114" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=266114" title="Theodore Sturgeon">
Theodore Sturgeon

Theodore Sturgeon (26 February 1918 — 8 May 1985) was an American science fiction author. 
He used a special writing style called "rhythmic prose". Prose writing tells a story, but rhythmic writing is often poetry. His prose text would fit into a standard poetry rhythm, or meter. This made subtle shift in mood. Usually the reader would not notice how the timing of the words changed their feeling.
His most famous novel is "More Than Human" (1953).
Sturgeon was born Edward Hamilton Waldo in Staten Island, New York City in 1918. His name was legally changed at age eleven after his mother's divorce and remarriage to William Dicky ("Argylle") Sturgeon. "Theodore Sturgeon" is occasionally misidentified as a pseudonym; it was in fact his legal name.
He sold his first story in 1938 to the McClure Syndicate, which bought much of his early (non-fantastic) work; his first genre appearance was "Ether Breather" in "Astounding Science Fiction" a year later. At first he wrote mainly short stories, primarily for genre magazines such as "Astounding" and "Unknown", but also for general-interest publications such as "Argosy Magazine". He used the pen name "E. Waldo Hunter" when two of his stories ran in the same issue of "Astounding". A few of his early stories were signed "Theodore H. Sturgeon."
Sturgeon ghost-wrote an Ellery Queen mystery novel, "The Player on the Other Side" (Random House, 1963). This novel gained critical praise from critic H.R.F. Keating, who "had almost finished writing "Crime and Mystery: the 100 Best Books", in which I had included "The Player on the Other Side" ... placing the book squarely in the Queen canon" when he learned that it had been written by Sturgeon. Similarly, "William DeAndrea, author and ... winner of Mystery Writers of America awards, selecting his ten favorite mystery novels for the magazine "Armchair Detective", picked "The Player on the Other Side" as one of them. He said: 'This book changed my life ... and made a raving mystery fan (and therefore ultimately a mystery writer) out of me. ... The book must be 'one of the most skilful pastiches in the history of literature. An amazing piece of work, whomever did it'."
Sturgeon wrote the screenplays for the ' episodes "Shore Leave" (1966) and "Amok Time" (1967, later published as a "Fotonovel" in 1978). The latter is known for his invention of the pon farr, the Vulcan mating ritual, the first use of the sentence "Live long and prosper" and the first use of the Vulcan hand symbol. Sturgeon also wrote several episodes of ' that were never produced. One of these was notable for having first introduced the Prime Directive. He also wrote an episode of the Saturday morning show "Land of the Lost", "The Pylon Express", in 1975. Two of Sturgeon's stories were adapted for The New Twilight Zone. One, "A Saucer of Loneliness", was broadcast in 1986 and was dedicated to his memory. Another short story, "Yesterday was Monday", was the inspiration for The New Twilight Zone episode A Matter of Minutes. His 1944 novella "Killdozer!" was the inspiration for the 1970s made-for-TV movie, Marvel comic book, and alternative rock band of the same name.
Although Sturgeon is well-known among readers of classic science-fiction anthologies (at the height of his popularity in the 1950s he was the most anthologized author alive) and much respected by critics (John Clute writes in "The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction": "His influence upon writers like Harlan Ellison and Samuel R. Delany was seminal, and in his life and work he was a powerful and generally liberating influence in post-WWII US sf"), he is not much known among the general public and won comparatively few awards (though it must be noted that his best work was published before the establishment and consolidation of the leading genre awards, while his later production was scarcer and weaker). He was listed as a primary influence of the much more famous Ray Bradbury. Kurt Vonnegut based his character Kilgore Trout on Theodore Sturgeon.
Sturgeon died on May 8, 1985, of lung fibrosis, in Eugene, Oregon. Sturgeon lived for several years in the neighboring city of Springfield.
In 1951, Sturgeon said something that is now known as Sturgeon's Law. He said, "Ninety percent of SF [science fiction] is crud, but then, ninety percent of "everything" is crud." At first, this was called Sturgeon's Revelation. Sturgeon has said that "Sturgeon's Law" was originally "Nothing is always absolutely so." However, the former statement is now widely referred to as Sturgeon's Law. He is also known for his strong support of critical thinking and challenging all normative assumptions: "Ask the next question." He represented this credo by the symbol of a Q with an arrow through it, an example of which he wore around his neck and used as part of his signature in the last 15 years of his life.
Movie producers hired Sturgeon under his own name to write novelisations of these movies based on their scripts:
Sturgeon published numerous short story collections during his lifetime, many drawing on his most prolific writing years of the 1940s and 1950s. 
Note that some reprints of these titles (especially paperback editions) may cut one or two stories from the line-up. Statistics herein refer to the original editions only. 
The following table includes sixteen volumes (one of them collecting western stories) where up to three stories (representing no more than half the book) were previously published in a Sturgeon collection.
The following 6 collections consisted entirely of reprints of previously collected material:
North Atlantic Books has been releasing the chronologically assembled "The Complete Short Stories of Theodore Sturgeon", edited by Paul Williams, since 1994. The series will run to 13 volumes, with the last appearing in 2010.

Battle of Britain

The Battle of Britain was an attack by the German Air Force ("Luftwaffe") on Great Britain during the summer and autumn of 1940.
The first objective of the campaign was to gain control of the air space above Britain from the Royal Air Force (RAF), especially Fighter Command.
The name comes from a famous speech delivered by Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the House of Commons: "The Battle of France is over. I expect the Battle of Britain is about to begin..." 
The Battle of Britain was the first major campaign to be fought entirely by air forces, and was also the largest and longest aerial bombing campaign to that date.
From July 1940 coastal shipping convoys and shipping centres, such as Portsmouth, were the main targets. A month later the "Luftwaffe" shifted its attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure (other useful war targets). As the battle progressed the "Luftwaffe" also targeted aircraft factories and ground infrastructure.
Coastal radar stations were bombed, so that at one point only one radar mast was standing. The British used a back-up system of human observers to get information to the headquarters of Fighter Command. Most historians agree this part of the campaign went in Germany's favour.
Eventually the "Luftwaffe" switched to attacking population centres, such as towns and cities, as well as factories. After the RAF bombed Berlin, and German air force bases in France, Adolf Hitler cancelled his orders not to bomb population centres and ordered attacks on British cities. The attacks on civilians were terror bombing tactics designed to cause panic and damage morale.
On 7 September 1940, a massive series of raids with nearly four hundred bombers and more than six hundred fighters targeted docks on the Thames in London, day and night.
The RAF 11 Group rose to meet them, in greater numbers than the "Luftwaffe" expected. 12 Group's Big Wing took twenty minutes to gain formation, missing its intended target, but coming across another formation of bombers while still climbing. They returned, feeling sorry about their limited success, and blamed the delay on being requested too late.
The "Luftwaffe" began to abandon their morning raids, with attacks on London starting late in the afternoon for 57 nights of attacks in a row.
Fighter Command had been suffering low morale, short of men and machines, and the break from airfield attacks allowed them to recover. This meant that, week by week, the defenders were getting stronger, and the losses suffered by the "Lutfwaffe" were growing.
On 15 September two massive waves of German attacks were prevented by the RAF, with every aircraft of 11 Group being used on that day. The total casualties on this important day were 60 German and 26 RAF aircraft shot down. The German defeat caused Hitler to order, two days later, the "postponement" of preparations for the invasion of Britain. Afterwards, in the face of increasing losses in men, aircraft and the lack of good replacements, the "Luftwaffe" switched from daylight to night-time bombing.
On 27 September, a Junkers Ju 88 returning from a raid on London was shot down in Kent. The German airmen survived to fight a battle against British troops stationed locally. It is said to be the first time in nearly 300 years that armed invaders had fought with British soldiers on British soil.
The keystone of the British defence was the detection, command, and control which ran the battle. This was the 'Dowding System', after its chief architect, Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding, the leader of RAF Fighter Command.
The core of Dowding's system was the use of Radio Direction Finding (RDF, later called radar, for radio detection and ranging). Its use, plus by information by the Royal Observer Corps, was crucial. It allowed the RAF to intercept incoming German aircraft. Radar operators were linked via telephone (whose wires were laid deep underground with concrete anti-bomb protection) to an operational centre. This centre was Fighter Command control at Bentley Priory. During the Battle several Coastal Command and Fleet Air Arm units came under Fighter Command control.
The "Luftwaffe"'s Messerschmitt Bf 109E and 110C squared up against the RAF's workhorse Hawker Hurricane Mk I and the less numerous Supermarine Spitfire Mk I. The Bf 109E had a better climb rate and was 10 to 30 mph faster than the Hurricane, depending on altitude. In September 1940 the more powerful Mk IIa series 1 Hurricanes started entering service although only in small numbers. This version was capable of a maximum speed of 342 mph, some 25 to 30 mph faster than the Mk I.
The performance of the Spitfire over Dunkirk came as a surprise, although the German pilots retained a strong belief that the 109 was the superior fighter. However, the Bf 109E had a much larger turning circle than either the Hurricane or the Spitfire. The two British fighters had eight Browning 303 machine guns, while most Bf 109Es had two machine guns and two wing cannons. The Bf 109E and the Spitfire were superior to each other in key areas; for instance, at some altitudes, the Bf 109 could out-climb the British fighter.
The failure of Nazi Germany to achieve its objectives of destroying Britain's air defences, or forcing Britain to negotiate an armistice or an outright surrender, is considered its first major defeat and one of the crucial turning points in the war.
If Germany had gained air superiority, Adolf Hitler might have launched Operation Sea Lion, a planned amphibious and airborne invasion of Britain.

Thermite

Thermite is an incendiary mixture. It is not an explosive, but can burn very fast and very hot.
It is made of an oxide of a less reactive metal mixed with a more reactive metal. One of the most common mixtures is iron(III) oxide-aluminium. The iron(III) oxide oxidizes the aluminium, being reduced to iron in the process. The aluminium is oxidized to aluminium oxide. 
Many other metal oxides and metals can be used for thermite. Some metals that can be used are boron, magnesium, calcium, titanium, zinc, or silicon. Some metal oxides that can be used are copper(II) oxide, chromium(III) oxide, iron(II,III) oxide, manganese(IV) oxide, silicon dioxide, boron trioxide, or lead(II,IV) oxide. A metal cannot be used with its metal oxide. The metal has to be more reactive than the metal in the oxide, or the thermite will not work. 
The reaction for an aluminium-iron(III) oxide thermite is this:
It is difficult to ignite thermite. It needs to be very hot. Ribbons of magnesium metal are used. A mixture of potassium permanganate and glycerin can be used to ignite thermite. It can be ignited by a flint lighter or a child's sparkler. It can be mixed with sulfur to make thermate, which makes it easier to melt the iron. 
Contrary to popular opinion, metals can burn. They need to be powdered, though, or they will conduct the heat away too fast to start a fire. 
The thermite ("thermit") reaction was discovered in 1893. German chemist Hans Goldschmidt patented it in 1895. People called it the "Goldschmidt reaction" or "Goldschmidt process". Goldschmidt was trying to make very pure metals without the use of carbon in smelting. He soon discovered the value of thermite in welding. It started to be used in the early 1900's to weld train tracks.
Thermite is used for welding railroad rails together. It is also used to make some metals. Chromium can be made by a thermite reaction between chromium(III) oxide and aluminium. The first uranium was made by a thermite. It is also used to weld wires together.
Thermite was used in the military as an incendiary weapon. It is mainly used to destroy buildings and equipment as it melts the metal easily. Barium nitrate can be added to thermite to make an easier-burning mixture. This mixture is used in the military. People dropped thousands of little bomblets containing thermite on cities, starting fires everywhere.
Thermite may also be used in fireworks to make them explode
Thermite is not safe to make at home. It releases ultraviolet light which can damage the eyes. It also makes a very hot flame that can melt iron. It is extremely difficult to extinguish. Streams of molten iron can flow out of a thermite mixture, igniting everything around it. Some metals can boil and burst into flames when placed in thermite, such as zinc. If it is preheated then ignited, thermite can burn very fast, releasing a huge amount of heat and light. If it is dropped in water it can boil water very fast, making an explosion. Dropping it on ice can make the ice explode, however it is safe to drop it into a three liter beaker filled with lightly moist sand.

Boulder, Colorado

Boulder is a city in the state of Colorado, in the United States. It is the county seat of Boulder County. Boulder is in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The city's height is . It is northwest of Denver. In 2011, there were 98,889 people living the City of Boulder. The Boulder Metropolitan Statistical Area has 294,567 people living in it.
Boulder is famous for its history and its Western traditions. In the late 1960s, lots of hippies moved to Boulder. The main campus of the University of Colorado, the University of Colorado at Boulder, is also here. CU Boulder is the biggest university in Colorado. The city is thought to be one of the best cities for health, well-being, quality of life, education, and art.
On November 7, 1861, the government decided to build a university in Boulder. The legislature decided that the university would be run by the state. The first building was built in 1875. The cornerstone for the Old Main Building was laid on September 20, 1875. The university was officially opened on September 5, 1877.
In 1907, the city of Boulder passed an anti-saloon ordinance. This law said that saloons and bars could not do business in the city, and that people could not drink alcohol. In 1916, the entire state of Colorado started prohibition. In US History, the "Prohibition Era" was a time when all alcohol was illegal. People could not make, drink, buy, sell, or serve alcohol. Prohibition ended in 1933, when the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed by Congress.
The 2010 United States Census said there are 94,673 people living in the City of Boulder. These people make up 16,788 families and 39,596 households. The population density was 3,884.1 people per square mile (1,499.9 people/km²). Boulder's population density is higher than Denver's, and the third highest in the state. (Englewood and Northglenn have higher population densities.) According to the census, the people living in Boulder are 88.3% White, 1.2% black or African-American, 0.48% Native American, 4.02% Asian, 0.05% Pacific Islander, 3.5% of another race, and 2.4% of two or more races. 8.9% of the population are Hispanic or Latino of any race. In December 2009, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the population of Boulder was 98,889 people.
The City of Boulder is in Boulder Valley. This is a place where the Rocky Mountain meet the Great Plains. To the West of the city are some rock formations called the Flatirons. These are large flat pieces of sedimentary stone that are tilted up on the foothills. The Flatirons are famous as a symbol of Boulder.
Boulder Creek flows through the City. Boulder Creek was named a long time before the city was built. It was named after the big granite boulders that have fallen into the creek over the years. Historians think that Boulder City was named after Boulder Creek. The water in Boulder Creek comes from melting mountain snow and small rivers West of the city. Boulder Creek is a tributary of the South Platte River.
Boulder covers according to the U.S. Census Bureau. This includes of land and (3.94%) of water.
The 40th parallel (40 degrees north latitude) runs through Boulder. Baseline Road runs along the parallel today.
Flagstaff Mountain overlooks Boulder. The city is a few miles east of the Continental Divide and about northwest of Denver. Denver International Airport is about southeast of Boulder. The city gets its water from Arapahoe Glacier and Boulder Creek.
Boulder has a dry climate. (Much of Colorado is dry.) It has many sunny or mostly sunny days every year. According to the Köppen climate classification, the city's climate is "semi-arid" (Köppen "BSk"). Winters are cool, but sometimes can get very cold. During the winter, the high temperature is usually in the mid- to upper- 40s°F (7–9 °C). The low temperature in winter can be below −10 °F (−23 °C) on a few nights. Usually it does not stay below 0 °F (−18 °C) for many days at a time. 
Even though it is cold in the winter, Boulder does not get as much snow as the mountains. This is because of something called orographic lift. This means that the mountains in the west dry out the air as it passes over the Front Range. By the time the air gets to Boulder, most of the water and snow has been removed. Sometimes there are heavy snow storms, but not too often. The average amount of snow in Boulder is per season, total. Usually only a few inches fall at a time. Because Boulder is so high up, the sun is very strong and hot, so the snow melts quickly. Sometimes Chinook Winds will make the temperature go up quickly and have the snow melt even faster.
Summer in Boulder is hot and dry. Usually there are 27 days during the summer that reach or above. It is much cooler at night because of how high up the city is. The hottest temperature ever was on June 23, 1954 and July 11, 1954. On those days it was . The coldest temperature was in February 1989 and December 1990, when it was .
Boulder is a Home Rule Municipality. In Colorado, this means that Boulder's government was formed according to three different legal documents. These documents are: Article XX of the Constitution of the State of Colorado; Title 31, Article 1, Section 202 of the Colorado Revised Statutes; and Boulder's own Home Rule Charter. 
Boulder is very liberal and very Democratic. , registered voters in Boulder County were 41% Democrat, 20% Republican, 1% other parties, and 38% unaffiliated (not any specific party.) Boulder county includes the conservative suburbs of Boulder City. Boulder is sometimes called the "People's Republic of Boulder" or "25 square miles surrounded by reality." This is a lot like nicknames given to other liberal cities that have more conservative areas surrounding them, like Columbia, Missouri, Madison, Wisconsin, and Austin, Texas.
Boulder was the first city in Colorado to pass a law that made it illegal to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation. This law was passed by the Boulder City Council in 1974. The law was repealed (cancelled) by the voters that same year. In 1975, Boulder became the second city to ever grant a same-sex marriage license. The license was given by Boulder County Clerk Clela Rorex. Soon after a law was passed that said that marriage licenses could not be given to people of the same gender. In 1987, the people of Boulder voted again to make it illegal to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation. This was passed by popular vote. Boulder became the first city in the United States that had this kind of a law that was passed by a direct vote of the people.
In 1996, Boulder passed a law that banned smoking in public places and bars. It was the first city in Colorado to have a smoking ban that included smoking in bars.
Most of the people who live in Boulder are very liberal. There are also people who are conservative and libertarian. Bob Greenlee was a conservative Republican who was the mayor of Boulder. He ran against Mark Udall for Congress in Colorado's 2nd congressional district. 
Boulder has seven official sister cities:
There are several landmarks in Boulder in honor of the sister cities. The Sister City Plaza was dedicated in May 17, 2007. It is on the east lawn of Boulder's Municipal Building. The plaza was built in honor of Boulder's relationships with its sister cities.

Osteoarthritis

Osteoarthritis normally affects older people: it is a disease where joints wear out. As the joint surface wears away, it sheds particles which stimulate the joint lining to produce fluid. This causes the joint to swell. When the joint "cartilage" wears away, the core of the bone becomes exposed. The exposed bone rubs against other exposed bone. 
Joints will be stiff and painful, and may be swollen. The pain may be worse after exercise. It may get harder to move the joint.
