<doc id="399013" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=399013" title="Our Lady of Fatima">
Our Lady of Fatima

Our Lady of Fatima is a Roman Catholic title for the Virgin Mary due to her apparitions to three shepherd children, Lucia Santos, and her two cousins, Jacinta and Francisco Marto. The apparition is believed to have appeared at the town of Fatima, Portugal on the thirteenth day of six consecutive months in 1917, starting on May 13. Her name in Portuguese is Nossa Senhora de Fátima. She is also called Our Lady of the Rosary or Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima.
On May 13, 1917, Lucia and her two cousins, Jacinta and Francisco Marto, were herding sheep at a location known as Cova da Iria, near their hometown village, Fatima. Lúcia described seeing a woman "brighter than the sun, shedding rays of light clearer and stronger than a crystal ball filled with the most sparkling water and pierced by the burning rays of the sun." Amazed, Lucia and her cousins ran back to their village and told everyone what they saw. Further appearance of the Virgin Mary were reported to be on the thirteenth day of the month in June and July. In these, the Virgin Mary asked the children to do acts of penance and Acts of Reparation as well as personal sacrifice to save sinners. The children subsequently wore tight cords around their waists to cause themselves pain, performed self-flagellation using stinging nettles, abstained from drinking water on hot days, and performed other works of penance. According to Lúcia's account, in the course of her appearances, the woman confided to the children three secrets, now known as the Three Secrets of Fátima. 
As early as July 1917, it was claimed that the Virgin Mary promised a miracle for the last of her apparitions on October 13, so that all could believe. What happened became known as "The Miracle of the Sun." A huge flock of crowds filled with approximately 70,000 came to witness this miracle. People who witnessed this miracle said that they saw the "Sun dance." They also said that they could look at the sun without any problems. As the crowd was looking at the sun, Lucio, Jacinta, and Fransisco said they saw lovely images of the Holy Family, Our Lady of Sorrows with Jesus Christ, and then Our Lady of Mount Carmel. They said they saw Saint Joseph and Jesus bless the people.
The first vision of Fatima was a vision of hell which Lúcia describes in her Third Memoir, as follows:
"Our Lady showed us a great sea of fire which seemed to be under the earth. Plunged in this fire were demons and souls in human form, like transparent burning embers, all blackened or burnished bronze, floating about in the conflagration, now raised into the air by the flames that issued from within themselves together with great clouds of smoke, now falling back on every side like sparks in a huge fire, without weight or equilibrium, and amid shrieks and groans of pain and despair, which horrified us and made us tremble with fear. The demons could be distinguished by their terrifying and repulsive likeness to frightful and unknown animals, all black and transparent. This vision lasted but an instant. How can we ever be grateful enough to our kind heavenly Mother, who had already prepared us by promising, in the first Apparition, to take us to heaven. Otherwise, I think we would have died of fear and terror."
The second secret included Mary's instructions on how to save souls from hell and convert the world to the Christian faith, also revealed by Lúcia in her Third Memoir:
"I have seen hell where the souls of poor sinners go. To save them, God wishes to establish in the world devotion to my Immaculate Heart. If what I say to you is done, many souls will be saved and there will be peace. The war is going to end: but if people do not cease offending God, a worse one will break out during the Pontificate of Pius XI. When you see a night illuminated by an unknown light, know that this is the great sign given you by God that he is about to punish the world for its crimes, by means of war, famine, and persecutions of the Church and of the Holy Father. To prevent this, I shall come to ask for the consecration of Russia to my Immaculate Heart, and the Communion of reparation on the First Saturdays. If my requests are heeded, Russia will be converted, and there will be peace; if not, she will spread her errors throughout the world, causing wars and persecutions of the Church. The good will be martyred; the Holy Father will have much to suffer; various nations will be annihilated. In the end, my Immaculate Heart will triumph. The Holy Father will consecrate Russia to me, and she shall be converted, and a period of peace will be granted to the world."
The Third Secret was never revealed by the Holy See until June 26, 2000. The third secret, a vision of the death of the Pope and other religious figures, was transcribed by the Bishop of Leiria and reads:
"After the two parts which I have already explained, at the left of Our Lady and a little above, we saw an Angel with a flaming sword in his left hand; flashing, it gave out flames that looked as though they would set the world on fire; but they died out in contact with the splendour that Our Lady radiated towards him from her right hand: pointing to the earth with his right hand, the Angel cried out in a loud voice: 'Penance, Penance, Penance!'. And we saw in an immense light that is God: 'something similar to how people appear in a mirror when they pass in front of it' a Bishop dressed in White 'we had the impression that it was the Holy Father'. Other Bishops, Priests, men and women Religious going up a steep mountain, at the top of which there was a big Cross of rough-hewn trunks as of a cork-tree with the bark; before reaching there the Holy Father passed through a big city half in ruins and half trembling with halting step, afflicted with pain and sorrow, he prayed for the souls of the corpses he met on his way; having reached the top of the mountain, on his knees at the foot of the big Cross he was killed by a group of soldiers who fired bullets and arrows at him, and in the same way there died one after another the other Bishops, Priests, men and women Religious, and various lay people of different ranks and positions. Beneath the two arms of the Cross there were two Angels each with a crystal aspersorium in his hand, in which they gathered up the blood of the Martyrs and with it sprinkled the souls that were making their way to God." 
Eight years after the Fátima events, Sister Lúcia was living in a Dorothean convent in Pontevedra, Spain. She reported that on December 10, 1925 she experienced another apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary. On this occasion, in Sister Lucia's own words, the Virgin returned as She had promised at Fatima to relate the specific requirements for the Communion of Reparation on the First Saturdays. 
Here is how Sister Lúcia describes the appearance: "The Most Holy Virgin appeared to me, and by her side, elevated on a luminous cloud, was the Child Jesus. The Most Holy Virgin rested her hand on my shoulder and as she did so, she showed me a heart encircled by thorns, which she was holding in her other hand."
During this alleged apparition, the Child Jesus asked Sister Lúcia to have compassion on His Mother, referring to her as the heavenly mother of Sister Lúcia. Later On February 15, 1926 Lucia reported to have seen the child Jesus when emptying a garbage can in the garden. The child (Jesus) told Lucia to not do any more promoting for the first First Saturday's devotion.
At this point, the Virgin Mary is said to have set the parameters of the Five First Saturdays devotion. If one fulfilled these conditions on the First Saturday of five consecutive months, the Virgin Mary promised special graces at the hour of death.
The devotion of the Communion of Reparation on the Five First Saturdays, mentioned by the Virgin at Fátima on July 13, 1917, and then confirmed at Pontevedra as described above, some believe is an essential part of the Message of Fátima.

Wheelchair basketball

Wheelchair basketball is a type of basketball for people who use wheelchairs.
Types in wheelchair basketball plays an important undertakings in the sport as the order uses total points of players to come to a decision about who can be on the basketball court. The system of ordering for the sport are 1 point player, 2 point player, 3 point player, 4 point player and 4.5 point player. The higher the point number, the greater the player's able to use body power to play wheelchair basketball. With five players on the basketball count, the total number of points may not be greater than fourteen. There has been supported views put forward as to errors of the order system as being overly complex from players, coaches and leagues. These criticisms have been printed materials in theory but not doing research made public in 1986, 1990, 1995 and 1997. 
At times, players may not easily go into into a type for a full point. For this reason, they can be put in order in between, such as 1.5 points, 2.5 points, and 3.5 points. Classifiers are said words tending to stop from giving to this half point order as a competitors first order. They are said to do on the second order.

Waltz (music)

Waltz music is written in 3/4 time (three beats per bar). The music is both dance music and art music. The Strauss family were perhaps the most famous of all waltz composers: notably Johann Strauss I, and Johann Strauss II the composer of the famous "The Blue Danube".
Waltzes typically have one chord per measure, and the accompaniment style particularly associated with the waltz is (as seen in the example to the right) to play the root of the chord on the first beat, the upper notes on the second and third beats.
The origins of the dance are in late 18th century Germany, probably from a folk dance called the "Lander". Today the music is danced in two forms, the Viennese waltz and the English or Slow waltz (now often called the International waltz). The choreography of these modern forms is different from the original dance. There are also a number of ballets which feature waltz music.

Buster Crabbe

Clarence Linden "Buster" Crabbe II (February 7, 1908 – April 23, 1983) was an American Olympic swimmer, and a movie and television actor. He won a gold medal in the 400-meter freestyle at the 1932 Summer Olympics and for playing science fiction hero Flash Gordon in three movie serials. He is the only actor to have played the three most popular pulp fiction heroes of the 1930s — Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, and Tarzan.
Crabbe started swimming as a boy. He went to the University of Southern California, and was a member of its first swim team. He trained as an Olympics swimmer, and won a bronze medal in the 1928 Summer Olympics and a gold medal in the 1932 Summer Olympics. He won 16 world and 35 national records during his swimming career.
After the 1932 Olympics, he went to Hollywood. He played the heroes in 103 feature length jungle, crime, drama, and western B-movies as well as the heroes in nine movie serials. In the late 1940s, Crabbe left movies to put together his own water show. He got into debt and looked for ways to make money. He turned to television.
He was the host a children's series in New York City and starred in an NBC adventure series called "Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion". His debts were paid, but his acting skills grew less in demand. He developed several business interests including Buster Crabbe Swim Pools. He retired to Scottsdale, Arizona, and died there of a heart attack in 1983.
Crabbe was born on February 7, 1908 in Oakland, California to Edward Clinton Simmons Crabbe and Lucy Agnes McNamara Crabbe. His father was a real estate broker. He was named Clarence Linden Crabbe after his grandfather. Clarence had a brother named Edward Clinton Simmons Crabbe II who was a year younger. He was named for their father. Clarence was nicknamed "Buster" and Edward II was nicknamed "Buddy". Both boys kept these nicknames for the rest of their lives.
Buster's ancestors include Captain John Meek, a Massachusetts man who chose a life on the sea. Meek married an Hawaiian girl in 1820, and lived in the Hawaiian Islands. Their daughter Elizabeth married an American sailor named Horace Gates Crabb. Horace added an "e" to his last name. Elizabeth and Horace had a son in 1861 they named Charles Linden Crabbe. He went to the United States at the age of 20 to work on the railroads. He lived in Nevada, and married Emma Rich in 1881. In 1882, Charles and Emma became the parents of Edward Clinton Simmons Crabbe, Buster's father.
After four years in Nevada, Charles moved his family to Hawaii. He later went into the Hawaii State Senate. His son Edward went to school in Hawaii and then to college at the University of California, Berkeley. He dropped out of college to sell real estate in the San Francisco area. Edward Crabbe married Agnes McNamara in 1907. A business partner stole Crabbe's money in 1913, leaving him broke. He had no choice but to move his wife and sons to Oahu. They lived in the house of his parents. In later life, Buster said he always thought of the Islands his true home.
Buster Crabbe grew up in Hawaii. He started swimming on the beach at Waikīkī as a young boy. When his father became the manager of a pineapple plantation on Oahu, the whole family moved away from the beach. Buster and his brother had to stop swimming. A year after the move, Mr. Crabbe got a real estate job in Hilo, Hawaii. The family moved to Hilo, and the boys started swimming again when their father joined a yacht club. With all the moving about, it was not easy for the Crabbe boys to go to school. Buster was eight and a half years old when he joined the first grade in Hilo Union School.
When World War I started in 1918, Buster's father joined the Army. He graduated from Officer Candidate School, and moved his family to the Schofield Barracks in the center of Oahu. Once again, the boys were too far from the beach to go swimming. They rode horses instead, and went to the Honolulu Military Academy. When Buster's father was discharged from the Army in 1920, he moved his family to Honolulu. Mr. and Mrs. Crabbe were divorced about 1920. The two boys were placed in the custody of their father. They lived with their grandparents in Honolulu.
Buster went to the University of Hawaii in 1928 to study law. He was also offered a place at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Yale University offered him a scholarship based on his swim talent. Only his tuition would be paid, but Crabbe thought he could work to pay for other costs. Yale also had a famous swim team. This appealed to Crabbe. He visited Yale on his way to the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. He liked Yale, and decided to go there instead of West Point. He was 20 when he went to Yale to study law.
Two weeks into his first year at Yale, Crabbe returned to Hawaii because his grandmother was dying. She did not die until the spring of 1929 though. Yale told Crabbe he could come back to the university on his scholarship, but he would have to start over as a freshman. He didn't want to do this. He applied to Stanford University, but was told the same thing. He was happy when he got a scholarship to the University of Southern California (USC) as a sophomore. He worked in a downtown Los Angeles store to make money, and joined the Sigma Chi fraternity. He was a member of USC's first swim team. He got his Bachelor of Science degree from USC in June 1931.
Buster started swimming as a very young boy. He was 15 years old when he joined his school's swim team. In his last year at school, he was captain of the team. He graduated with four letters in varsity sports. After high school, he competed in many swim meets and won many awards and titles.
He won a place on the 1928 Summer Olympics team, but became ill with the flu on his way to Amsterdam, where the Olympics were being held. He lost at least . He was not up to his usual strength, and won only a third place bronze medal in the 800-meter freestyle.
He kept training and competed in the 1932 Summer Olympics at Los Angeles. He won the gold medal in the 400-meter freestyle by a tenth of a second. This was a new world record. He was the only male swimmer to win Gold at the 1932 Summer Olympics. He became a sports superstar known around the world.
Crabbe's movie career started in 1930 while he was going to USC. He was an extra in a few movies about college football and did stunts for Joel McCrea in a suspense movie. Crabbe got his first big part in 1932. It was a Tarzan-like character called Kaspa. He signed a one-year contract with Paramount Pictures. He was paid $100 a week. The movie was called "King of the Jungle"; it opened in theaters in 1933.
Next, Crabbe had a small part in "Man of the Forest", a western with closeted gay actor Randolph Scott. It was Crabbe's first western. He would make many more during his movie career. Crabbe showed his bare chest in one scene, and was told to "put more wood on the fire". He had one two-word line, "Yes, boss". He was billed on movie posters as "the star of "King of the Jungle"". After "Forest", he had a few bit parts, and then went to Paramount's acting classes.
In 1933, Crabbe starred in "Tarzan the Fearless". It was the one and only time he played Tarzan. "Fearless" was a movie serial in 12-parts. A movie fan had to go to the theater every week for 12 weeks to see the whole movie. The movie was a failure. Crabbe made six more movies in 1933. He saved $3,700 from the money he made. He had enough money to go to law school if his contract was not renewed. His contract was renewed, however. His salary was raised to $150 per week. The movie studio changed his name to Larry "Buster" Crabbe.
In 1934, he was in six movies. Only two were for Paramount, the studio that hired him. He was in Ida Lupino's first American movie, "Search for Beauty", and in a W. C. Fields movie called, "You're Telling Me!" Paramount loaned him to RKO Pictures and Majestic Pictures for one movie each, and to Mayfair Pictures for two movies. These three studios billed him as Buster Crabbe.
In 1935, Paramount renewed his contract for the third time. He was paid $300 a week. He made only three movies for Paramount in 1935: two westerns and a college football movie. He did not make any movies for other studios.
In 1936, Crabbe learned that Universal Pictures was planning to produce Alex Raymond's science fiction comic strip, "Flash Gordon", as a movie serial. He went to try-outs, and was offered the part of Flash at once. Crabbe accepted. He was under contract to Paramount at the time, so Universal made arrangements to borrow him.
"Flash Gordon" is famous for being the most expensive and the most popular movie serial ever made in America. Universal had turned two other comic strips into successful serials: "Tailspin Tommy" in 1934 and its sequel "Tailspin Tommy in the Great Air Mystery" in 1935. The "Flash Gordon" comic strip was hugely popular.
Crabbe had to have his hair bleached and waved for the part. He was not happy about this. He wore a hat outside the studio to hide his hair. Crabbe did his own stunts in the serial.
"Flash Gordon" was said to cost $350,000. Most of this cost went into science fiction sets, special effects, and costumes that looked like those in the comic strip. Crabbe was every boy's dream of a hero. He was strong, handsome, and honest. Jean Rogers played his girlfriend Dale Arden. Charles B. Middleton played his enemy, Ming the Merciless, the ruler of the planet Mongo.
"Flash Gordon" opened in movie theaters in 1936. It was a great success. Crabbe enjoyed the success, but wished he would get a part in a major motion picture. Paramount renewed his 1937 and 1938 contracts with raises. In 1938, he was paid $600 per week. He also played in crime movies and westerns at this time.
A sequel to "Flash Gordon" was made in 1938 called "Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars". It was a low budget serial and used scenes from the prequel. Crabbe was disappointed with the serial, but he was happy playing Flash again because the part had made him famous.
In 1938, he made another serial for Universal called "Red Barry". It was a modern detective story set in San Francisco. The serial was based on a comic strip by Will Gould.
Crabbe left Paramount in 1939. Crabbe told an interviewer that the studio did not want to give him a raise. "I spent more time away from my lot than I put there ... I was under contract there (Paramount) from 1932 to 1939. And it didn't cost them a penny. Every time I was loaned out they were paid ... I was supposed to get a $250 raise per week. And the studio called my agent and said we would like him to stay but we don't want to give him a raise." Crabbe's agent knew Universal had the star in mind for more serials and convinced him to leave Paramount. He had made 26 B-movies during his six years with Paramount, but never a major movie.
In 1939, he made another serial for Universal called "Buck Rogers". Like "Flash", it was based on a popular science fiction comic strip. Crabbe was paid $1,000 per week. Universal made Crabbe's third and final Flash Gordon serial, "Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe" in 1940. Crabbe was paid a flat $25,000. He became known as "The King of the Serials". He had made five serials for Universal and owed Universal (not Paramount) the stardom he had won.
Crabbe was disappointed with "Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe". He said, "I never forgave Universal for making a cheateryou know, using stock stuffof the last one ... The first serial ("Flash Gordon"), however, was the most expensive serial ever made, about $500,000 ... To risk this kind of money for a serial ... well, I thought they were crazy. Crazy."
Crabbe made a total of nine movie serials during his career. The last three were made for Columbia Pictures. In 1947, he made "The Sea Hound", and, in 1950, "Pirates of the High Seas". His last serial was "King of the Congo" in 1952.
Between 1941 and 1946, Crabbe starred in a series of westerns for Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC). He played a crime-fighting cowboy called Billy the Kid. Billy was not based on the real life outlaw of the American Old West, but the character's name was changed to Billy Carson to avoid confusion. Crabbe had signed with PRC for only two movies, but those two movies were hugely popular so the studio continued the series.
These PRC westerns took 10–12 days to make, and cost about $25,000 each. They were 50–60 minutes long, and were the second features on double bills. Crabbe made about eight of these westerns every year. He had time to make other movies during the year, too. He made jungle pictures and crime movies.
When World War II started, PRC had to make budget cuts. The shooting schedules for the "Billy" westerns were cut back from 10–12 days to 7–8 days. There was no time or money to correct mistakes. In one scene, for example, Crabbe bumps his head on a window frame as he jumps through the window. There was no time or money to reshoot the scene; it had to be left as it was.
Crabbe did not serve in the military during World War II because he was 34 years old and had a family. Instead, he made training movies for the Field Artillery. He kept making westerns for PRC during the war. In 1942 and 1943, he made 15 westerns. Crabbe's PRC contract ran out in 1946. He had made 36 "Billy" westerns for PRC.
Crabbe made five movie westerns between 1957 and 1965. None of these movies was special in any way. In 1970, he played an old cowboy in "The Comeback Trail". The movie did not do well. Crabbe said it was the best movie he ever made, but there were too many sexy scenes so families stayed away. He tried to convince the producers to make the movie more family-friendly by cutting the "heavy" scenes, but they refused. His last movies were "Swim Team" in 1979 and "The Alien Dead" in 1980.
During the summer months through the years he made the "Billy" movies, Crabbe kept swimming and also did water shows. About 1946, he put his savings into his own show. He called it, "The Aqua Parade". He said his two-hour show was a "labor of love" as well as a "profitable occupation". In 1947, his show played in cities and state fairs across the United States over a five-month period. The show got good reviews. Crabbe was in the water ballet and in a part of the show called "The Evolution of Swimming".
In 1950, the show went to Europe. It had problems. The company was asked to make new costumes and scenery for the Paris show. Crabbe knew this would cost a lot of money, but everyone in the show agreed that doing this would be better than going back to America. The show met more problems in Italy. The company had to swim in cold water in Milan because there was no time to heat the pool. Additionally, the show lost money because it played in a small arena with limited seating. In the end, Crabbe was $100,000 in debt and went back to America wondering what he was going to do. He started doing television.
Crabbe moved to the East Coast of the United States to be the host of a live, local New York City children's program called, "The Buster Crabbe Show". The series was televised on weekday evenings starting on March 12, 1951. The series setting was a western bunkhouse. Old western movies, serials, and comedies were shown. Crabbe shared games, stories, and other activities with the program's viewers.
During the production days of this show, Crabbe was also a swimming and boating counselor at his 16-building, boys and girls summer camp called "Buster Crabbe's Camp Meenahga" at Saranac Lake, New York in the Adirondack Mountains.
Although the program's title was changed to "Buster's Buddies", it was cancelled on October 3, 1952. It returned to television on September 21, 1953. A live kiddie audience was brought to the program, but the program was not popular. It was cancelled again on March 26, 1954.
Crabbe played Michael Gallant in the NBC adventure television series, "Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion". The series was televised from 1955 to 1957. It is set in modern Morocco where Captain Gallant was in charge of an outpost in the desert. He fought thieves, desert tribes, and other villains. Crabbe's son Cullen played Cuffy Sanders in the series. Cuffy was an orphan boy whose father had died in action with the Legion.
The Crabbes had signed a contract for three 30-minute episodes. These three episodes could be changed into a 90-minute movie for theaters if the television series failed. The three episodes were a success. The H. J. Heinz Company agreed to sponsor the series. Thirty-six 30-minute episodes were made. Crabbe was paid $1,000 per episode. Working on the series would take most of his time. He dropped his New York City television series, "The Buster Crabbe Show", so he could make "Captain Gallant".
The series started filming in April 1954. Crabbe's old friend Fuzzy Knight joined the cast. Outdoor scenes were filmed in North Africa. Indoor scenes were shot in Paris and Rome. The series stopped filming in October 1954. It had its television premiere on February 13, 1955. Children and long-time Crabbe fans loved the series. A fan club for Cuffy was started. Charlton Comics published four comic books based on the series in 1955 and 1956.
Tragedy struck the Crabbe family in 1957. When Crabbe's daughter "Sande" was a 20-year-old college student at USC, she had an obsession with dieting. She thought she needed to be as thin as possible for boys to be attracted to her. Her parents were worried. They got medical treatment for Sande and psychoanalysis, but she died April 10, 1957 of malnutrition. She weighed .
In all, there were sixty-five 30-minute black and white episodes. The series completed its first television run in February 1957. Reruns were televised between 1960 and 1963. Cullen Crabbe dropped acting when the series ended. In 1970, he said the only reason he played in the series was because no one could find a boy whose parents would let him live and work in North Africa for two years.
Crabbe was on television now and then after "Captain Gallant". He was in an episode of the "Ellery Queen" series in 1959, and co-hosted a 1961 NBC Easter television special with Rosemary Clooney called "Marineland Circus". In December 1965, CBS televised ceremonies at the Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Crabbe was there because he was going to become a member of the Hall of Fame. Crabbe was in two episodes of the "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century" television series in 1979, and one episode of "B. J. and the Bear" in 1981. This episode was the last time he was on television.
Crabbe was bankrupt after the disaster of his "The Aqua Parade". He looked about for ways to make money and to pay off his debts. His name was used to promote a New York health club, and he hosted a women's exercise television program, "Figure Fashioning". He was swim director at a hotel in the Catskill Mountains.
In 1952, he moved his family to New Jersey and taught swimming at Palisades Amusement Park. The same year, he made his "live" television debut on "Philco Playhouse" and then made his ninth and last movie serial, "King of the Congo".
In 1966, Crabbe passed an exam to become a New York City stockbroker with the Wall Street firm of Lieberbaum, Richter & Co. He led the annual Red Cross swim sessions at the Durland Scout Center in Rye, New York, and in 1969 continued his association with the Concord Hotel as Director of Water Activities. He also had two camps in the Adirondacks: a summer camp for young boys and a co-educational water camp for teenagers. He kept up with his work for Cascade Pools. In 1970, he wrote "Energistics", an exercise book for old people.
Crabbe died of a heart attack in Scottsdale, Arizona at the age of 75. He was soon buried at the Green Acres Memorial Park in Scottsdale, Arizona.
Crabbe was the only actor to play the three greatest pulp fiction heroes of the 1930s Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, and Tarzan. His early fame was renewed when nostalgia-minded television viewers discovered his Flash Gordon serials in the 1970s. In 2013, the three Flash Gordon serials, the Buck Rogers serial, and the Tarzan serial were all available on DVD.
In 1973, a poll on the University of Maryland campus revealed that the Flash Gordon serials were third on the student nostalgia charts. He was behind W. C. Fields and the Marx Brothers. The serials were shown on college campuses and on nationwide television channels. The New York City Public Broadcasting channel leased the serials, and televised them during the 7 p.m. news programs of other channels. The nationwide interest in the serials led to Crabbe being invited to make personal appearances in many places and to give talks on college campuses.
On his acting talent, Crabbe once said, "Some of my acting rose to the level of incompetence, and then leveled off. I was a lot better actor than people gave me credit for. I didn't have any training, but I feel that if I had been given the chance, I could have become a really good, top-rate actor."
At another time he said, "I always wished I could have been in one really good film. But they decide you're a guy who can fall off a horse and take a breakaway table over you're head, and there's nothing you can do about it ... Many fans have told me they saw in my portrayals a moralistic mien, something they could identify with or fantasize about as children. There's a place for hero worship in any society. It gives people something to look up to, even if no real hero can ever live up to the image people have of them."

Our Lady of China

Our Lady of China is a title for the Virgin Mary in China who is believed to have appear at the small village of Donglu in 1900. In Chinese she is called Zhōnghuá Shèngmǔ (). She is also known as Our Lady of Donglu.
During the Boxer Rebellion, about 10,000 soldiers attacked the small village of Donglu on April, 1900. The soldiers tried to kill the approximately 1,000 Christians. As the soldiers were attacking, the Virgin Mary appeared wearing a white robe in the sky. When the soldiers saw the apparition, they fired gunshots at the Virgin Mary. Despite the efforts to shoot down the apparition, the Virgin Mary continued to shine brightly. As the soldiers kept firing, another apparition appeared: a majestic angel, whom witnesses believed to be the Archangel Michael. The angel flew down surrounded by blazing flames of fire down from the sky and into the crowd of soldiers. By himself, Michael drove all of the soldiers out of the village. Villagers learned afterwards that their local priest, Father Wu, prayed to the Virgin Mary for help from the soldiers attacking. The residents of Donglu then built a church for the Virgin Mary to express their gratitude for the help they received. The Church was then destroyed during World War II after it was hit by Japanese bombs.
The Catholic Church built a shrine in 1992 to commemorate the 1900 apparition events and organized a large celebratory worship service nearby in an open field on May 23, 1995, which about 30,000 people attended. During the opening prayer, those present saw the sun moved from to right to left in the sky and shone down light of rays with different colors. Then the Virgin Mary holding the infant Jesus, appeared in the sky. Mary did not speak but witnesses (Chinese Christians whose faith was oppressed by the government) reported feeling comforted and encouraged by her appearance. The overwhelming public interest of visiting the shrine after the apparition took place, upset the Chinese government. The Chinese government then banned people from going to the shrine but still many pilgrims came.

Francis Cooke

Francis Cooke (ca. 1583 - April 7, 1663) was a passenger on the "Mayflower". He was a signer of the Mayflower Compact and was an important member of Plymouth Colony. 
Francis Cooke lived in England and then in Leiden Netherlands. 
Cooke married Hester Mahieu at the French Walloon Church in Leiden. In August 1606 Francis Cooke and his wife moved to Norwich in county Norfolk in England. They did not live there long and returned to Netherlands. Their son John was baptized at the Walloon Church in Leiden in 1607.
When the English Separatist Church members in Leiden decided to go to America in 1620, Cooke decided he would go with them. He brought his thirteen year–old son, John, with him. Cooke's wife and the younger children stayed in Leiden and came to Plymouth Colony on the ship "Anne" in July 1623.
The Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. Cooke was one of the signers. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.
In Plymouth Colony, the settlers were given land. In that Division of Land in 1623, Cooke received two acres, one for himself and one acre for his son John. He also received 4 acres for his wife and children who came over on the ship called "Anne" in 1623. 
Cooke's children were named John, Jacob, Jane, Hester and Mary.
Cooke seemed to have been trusted and liked by the other colonist because in early 1633, Cooke was assigned by the court to help resolve a dispute of a financial nature between Peter Browne and Dr. Samuel Fuller.
In 1640/41 Cooke was one of twelve men tasked by the court to make official travel routes, and make a formal survey and mark the boundaries of plots of land and for the Jones River. In 1645 he was again road surveyor for Plymouth. In June 1650, when he was almost seventy, he was still doing survey work. In August 1659, in his late 70s, he was again called upon by the Plymouth Court to help to decide a land boundary dispute between Thomas Pope and William Shurtliff.
Cooke also did other public service work, being on several petty and grand juries. He also served on civil case juries up to March 1643. Most of the civil case involved debts or slander. He was also on grand juries in 1638, 1640, 1642 and 1643 which involved more serious crimes.
In the 1643 Able to Bear Arms List, Francis Cooke and his sons Jacob and John Jr., are listed with those from Plymouth.
On December 7, 1659 Francis Cooke made out his will, saying he was weak in body. The will was very simple and he gave everything to Hester, his loving wife. 1609.
Francis Cooke died in Plymouth on April 7, 1663 and was buried on Burial Hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts.

Pandeism

Pandeism is the belief that a higher being like a God made the Universe, but made it by becoming it. People who follow Pandeism are called Pandeists. After making the Universe, God and the Universe are equivalent (the same thing.) Because God is now the Universe, it can not do things in the Universe. Pandeists believe that people who want to know about God should rely on logic and reason and not traditions of their religion. Pandeists believe that everything that exists is a part of God or that God is a part of everything that exists. The name Pandeism comes from the words Deism (a kind of belief in God) and pan (all). 
Pandeists believe that a higher power became the world. They do not believe that the creation of the Universe happened because of a spontaneous event. They reject supernatural events like miracles and believe that God has become the natural laws as well, and does not need to interfere with them. Pandeists also see holy books, such as the Bible and Qur'an, as writings made by people rather than the writings of God. Pandeists believe that people are part of God too, and so some people think they see or hear God, when they are really only seeing or hearing the part of God that is in them.

Planetary science (or "planetology") is the organized study of planets, which are relatively large, stable bodies in orbits around stars.
The planet best known to us is obviously the Earth. There are seven other major planets in the Solar System. The Solar System also has dwarf planets, such as Pluto and Ceres, the largest asteroid. 
Space probes have gone near or landed on all planets in our solar system. In recent decades better telescopes have found planets in solar systems other than are own: exoplanets. One of the first was a planet found to be orbiting Barnard's star. 
Planetary science is a part of astronomy and geology. It is sometimes referred to as planetary geology.
Planetary science in a broad sense includes finding a planet's orbital period and orbital distance from its star, the mineral makeup of the planet, and an attempt to learn its age. It may also have a more narrow focus, such as the mapping of the planet's surface features and the makeup of its atmosphere.

Marquis (or marquess) is a title of nobility in many countries in Europe. It is usually considered to be a rank higher than an earl but lower than a duke.
This title was usually granted by a monarch to reward a subject for either longtime faithful service or the accompishment of some very notable deed or deeds. The title is hereditary, meaning that is passes from a father to his oldest son, or in some countries to all of his sons. Usually if a man holding this title dies without having any male heirs, the title is said to become extinct, meaning that it is no longer held by anyone living.
The female equivalent of this title is often styled marquessa; this title may be held by the wife of a marquis or granted to a woman in her own right.

Born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Hart began his career by winning several amateur comedy competitions at clubs throughout New England, culminating in his first real break in 2000 when he was cast by Judd Apatow for a recurring role on the TV series "Undeclared". The series lasted only one season, but he soon landed other roles in movies like "Paper Soldiers", "Scary Movie 3", "Think Like a Man", "Little Fockers" and "Soul Plane". His comedic reputation continued to grow with the release of his first stand-up album "I'm a Grown Little Man" in 2008. This was followed by "Seriously Funny" in 2010, and in 2011 "Laugh at My Pain". He currently stars as himself in the lead role of "Real Husbands of Hollywood". 
Kevin Hart was born on July 6, 1979, in North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was raised by his single mother, Nancy, and has one older brother, Robert Hart. His father, Henry, a cocaine addict, was in and out of jail throughout most of Kevin's childhood. Kevin used his natural ability to make people laugh as a coping mechanism to deal with his family struggles and to stay out of trouble. After attending George Washington High School in Northeast Philadelphia, he moved to New York City to attend community college, graduating two years later. He then moved to Brockton, Massachusetts, and found work as a shoe salesman. He began pursuing a career in stand-up comedy after performing at an amateur night at a club in Philadelphia.
In 2005, he was nominated for the BET Platinum Mic Viewers' Choice Award.
In 2012 Hart was named MVP of the NBA Celebrity All-Star Game regardless of the fact that he was ejected in the fourth quarter for cursing at the referee and taking off one of his shoes and throwing the other across the court. He scored eight points and had six assists in the game.
Hart then hosted the 2012 "MTV Video Music Awards". His longtime friend Judd Apatow, the director who gave him his first big on-screen break in the TV series "Undeclared", was the one who recommended him for the gig. Hart hopes that this will project him further into a side career as an emcee, stating, "Hopefully after MTV, of course we’re talking Emmys, Oscars, whatever."
In 2012, Hart won a Best Actor trophy at the BET Awards for his performance in the box-office hit movie "Think Like a Man".

Samoset (ca. 1590–1653) was the first Native American to speak with the Pilgrims in Plymouth Colony. On March 16, 1621, the people were very surprised when Samoset walked straight into Plymouth Colony where the people were living. He greeted them in English. Samoset said he had learned some of the language from some English fishermen that came to Maine.
Samoset was member of the Wampanoag tribe that lived in Maine. He was an important man within his tribe. Samoset talked with the leaders of Plymouth Colony. A few days later he came back with Squanto, an Indian leader who also spoke English.
Samoset is also sometimes called Somerset. The name Somerset may have been given by the English men whom came from Somerset in England. Capt. Levett met Samoset, along with other Native American leaders, in 1624 in the harbor of present-day Portland, Maine.
This is part of an account of the first meeting with Samoset by the people of Plymouth Colony:
This story was adapted for an episode of "The Mayflower Voyagers", of the Peanuts television miniseries "This is America, Charlie Brown".
Samoset appeared in "William Bradford: The First Thanksgiving", 1992 direct-to-video episode of "Animated Hero Classics". He was voiced by Michael Howard.
The Samoset Council of the Boy Scouts of America (located in northern Wisconsin) is named after Samoset.

2013 Connecticut train crash

A Metro-North Railroad train from New York City heading to New Haven, Connecticut collided with another train on May 17, 2013. This event happened at 6:10 PM (EST). An east-bound Metro-North train went off its tracks and collided with a west-bound train near Fairfield, Connecticut.
On May 17, 2013, officials shut down the train which usually carries between 125,000 people daily. It is one of the most busiest trains in the area. Metro-North was also shut down. All Amtrak trains that uses the New York City-New Haven path are shut down. This is to avoid further collisions. Because of a bridge replacement, the two trains were the only way going and coming from New York City.
Investigators believe the trains collided because the tracks were damaged. Some say the damaged was done when the trains collided. Others believe it was damaged before the two trains collided with each other. The wreckage of the trains were found to be as far as 200 yards away from the area the accident happened. Many cars that were near the event were heavily damaged. Connecticut governor, Dannel Malloy, believes this investigation will last several days. The FBI were part of the investigations. On May 18, they were no longer a part of the investigation crew.
One person is in critical condition at Bridgeport Hospital in Bridgeport, Connecticut as of May 19, 2013. There were five who were critically injured. One of them was "very critically injured". Six patients who were injured remain in St. Vincent's Medical Center, also in Bridgeport. Nine people are currently in the hospital, with 70 injured. Some reports state 60 people were injured. Many people saw broken limbs after this happened. 
Many people on the train had to break one of the trains windows to get out. There are no reported deaths. Many bodies flew out of the two trains.
The Metro-North train left from Grand Central Station in New York City at 4:41 p.m (EST) on May 17, 2013. There were 300 passengers on the train. It went off its track near I-95 in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The other train left New Haven, Connecticut at 5:30 pm. This train had 400 passengers. The two collided with each other at 6:10 pm near Fairfield, Connecticut.
Connecticut governor, Dan Malloy said in a press conference on May 18 that the investigation will be on-going for a couple days. A National Transportation Safety Board member Earl Weener said that they will not release further details on what happened. Bridgeport Mayor, Bill Finch believes the cost could hurt the region's economy by millions of US dollars. 
US senator Chris Murphy said that he is very pleased that no one has died from the collision. Richard Blumenthal, US senator, also said to the "New York Daily News" that he is happy to know no one has died.

Isaac Allerton ( 15601659) was born in England. In 1620, he travelled on the "Mayflower" with his wife, three children and apprentice John Hooke. 
Allerton belonged to the religion which was not allowed in England. In 1614 he and his family moved to Leiden Netherlands where he worked as a tailor. He married and had three children. 
The Allerton family and John Hooke, left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" spotted land. They had intended to go to Virginia Colony but the ship was damaged so they landed at Cape Cod on 21 November. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. Allerton signed the document. 
In the first year many people died from the cold weather and hunger including Allerton's wife and his apprentice. Allerton worked with Plymouth Governors to help save the colony. 
Starting in 1626, Allerton made many trips back and forth to England. The Mayflower passengers owed money to people in England who had helped pay for their voyage. Allerton was supposed to go to England and pay off some of this debt. Some of the people did not think that he was honest with the money. On one of his trips back from England, in 1630, Allerton came back without some of the supplies which they very much needed. 
In 1634, another sickness came to Plymouth Colony which caused many people to die including Allerton's second wife Fear.
Allerton died in 1659 in New Haven, Connecticut. His first wife, Mary died in 1621 and was buried in Cole's Hill Burial Ground, Plymouth. The burial place of his second wife, Fear is unknown.

Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantatjara Yankunytjatjara Women's Council

The Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Women's Council (NPY Women's Council, or NPYWC) is a community-based organisation that serves women of the Ngaanyatjarra, Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara communities in remote central Australia. It was formed in 1980, with its headquarters in Alice Springs. It provides a range of community, family, research and advocacy services, and represents the interests of women and their communities.
The idea for a women's organisation came during the late 1970s, when the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara communities of northwestern South Australia were struggling for the rights to their land. During meetings about land rights, the women felt that their needs were not being met, so they decided to establish their own organisation. A women's meeting was held at Amaṯa in 1980. It was chaired by Pitjantjatjara elder Nganyinytja, who had been a leader among women throughout the land-rights struggle. The formation of the NPY Women's Council is said to have been partly inspired by a speech Nganyinytja made at demonstration in Adelaide later in the year.
The first meeting of the Women's Council was held in December 1980, in Kaṉpi. It was organised by Mantatjara Wilson and Diana James, and attended by about 40 women. Tjunmutja Myra Watson was chosen to be the organisation's first chairperson, and Diana James was chosen as the secretary.
The NPY Women Council's covers about 350,000 square kilometres of the remote area where the borders of Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory meet. The region has a total population of about 6000. The council serves women belonging to the three indigenous groups in this region: the Ngaanyatjarra, Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara, who are closely related to one another. The area covered includes:

Carl Orff

Carl Orff (July 10, 1895 – March 29, 1982) was a German composer. Today, he is perhaps best remembered for his work Carmina Burana. Carmina Burana is a collection of texts from the Middle Ages. In 1937, Carl Orff wrote the music for some of these texts. His other well-known work, the Orff Schulwerk is aimed at teaching children about music. Carl Orff received many awards for his works. Amongst others he wrote "Reigen der Kinder", which was performed at the opening ceremony of the 1936 Summer Olympics. He also adapted the music for A Midsummer Night's Dream, which was originally written by Felix Mendelssohn. The problem was that Mendelsohn had Jewish roots, and the rulers of Germany at the time did not think this was suitable. Orff was a close friend of Kurt Huber, a prominent oppoent of the regime. Huber was a founding member of the opposition group White Rose. Huber was tried and executed in 1943.

Flash Gordon (1954 television series)

Flash Gordon is a science fiction television series. It aired from October 15, 1954 to July 15, 1955. It is based on the characters in the Flash Gordon comic strip created by Alex Raymond. The series set is set in 3203. Flash (Steve Holland), Dale Arden (Irene Champlin) and Dr. Zarkov (Joseph Nash) are agents of the Galactic Bureau of Investigation. They travel the galaxy in their ship the "Sky Flash" to battle cosmic villains under the order of Commander Paul Richards (Henry Beckman).
The series was filmed in West Berlin and Marseille as a West German, French and American co-production by Intercontinental Television Films and Telediffusion. The series aired in syndication throughout most of the U.S. It aired on the east coast on the DuMont Television Network.
The series was popular with American audiences. Critical response was positive. Modern critics brush the series off. Some critics respond positively to the series's presentation of Cold War and capitalist themes.
Universal Studios had held the production rights to "Flash Gordon" but allowed them to lapse. Former Universal executives Edward Gruskin and Matty Fox struck a deal with Flash Gordon owners King Features Syndicate to produce the first 26 episodes of the series. The series was produced by Gruskin and Wenzel Lüdecke. Writers for "Flash Gordon" included Gruskin, Bruce Geller and Earl Markham. Episodes were directed by Wallace Worsley, Jr. and Gunther von Fritsch. 
Production began in May 1953, with an empty beer hall in Spandau as the main shooting location. Only the lead actors and director Worsley spoke English. Worsley said: "No matter what galaxy we explored, everyone spoke with a German accent. The use of German actors who could not speak English required us to use a lot of close-ups. I would stand behind the camera, correctly positioned for the actor's look, and read his or her line; the actor would then repeat the line, mimicking my pronunciation and emphasis."
The series was budgeted at USD$15,000 per episode on a three-day-per-episode shooting schedule. Worsley withdrew from the project after completing the first 26 episodes. Production was moved to Marseille under the direction of Gunther von Fritsch for the 13 final episodes.

Governor of Pennsylvania

The Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is the head of the executive branch of Pennsylvania's government and the commander-in-chief of the state's military.
The job of the governor is to enforce state laws and to approve or veto bills passed by the Pennsylvania Legislature. The governor may grant pardons except in cases of impeachment.
There have been seven presidents and 46 governors of Pennsylvania. Two governors serving non-consecutive terms. There have been a total of 55 terms in both offices. The longest term was that of the first governor, Thomas Mifflin. He served three full terms as governor and two years as president. The shortest term belonged to John Bell. He served only 19 days as acting governor after Edward Martin resigned. The current governor is Tom Wolf. His term began on January 20, 2015.
Pennsylvania was one of the first thirteen colonies. It became a state on December 12, 1787. 
The first constitution in 1776 created the Supreme Executive Council as the executive branch. The President was the leader of the Council. The president was picked each year by the council.
The 1776 constitution created the position of "vice-president" but it did not say what should happen if the president left office. This happened four times. Sources from that time still listed the chief executive as the vice president when that person acted as the president. One acting president, George Bryan, has since been recognized as a governor. This is because he acted as president for over six months.
The 1790 constitution ended the council. It replaced the president with a governor, and created a three-year term for governor. This term started on the third Tuesday of the December after the election. A governors could not serve more than nine out of any twelve years. The 1838 constitution moved the start of the term to the third Tuesday of the January after the election. It allowed governors to only serve six out of any nine years. The 1874 constitution lengthened the term to four years. It said that governors could not succeed themselves (be elected to another term while still in office). The current constitution of 1968 changed this to allow governors to serve two consecutive terms. There are no limits on the number of terms a governor may serve in total as long as there is a four year break after a second term.
If the governor dies, resigns or is impeached, the lieutenant governor becomes governor for the rest of the term. If the governor becomes unable to act as governor because of disability, the lieutenant governor only acts out the duties of governor. Should both offices be vacant, the president "pro tempore" of the state senate becomes governor. The position of lieutenant governor was created in the 1874 constitution. Before this, the speaker of the senate would act as governor in cases of vacancy. At first, the lieutenant governor could only act as governor. It was not until the 1968 constitution that the lieutenant governor could actually become governor. The office of governor has been vacant for an extended period of time once. There was a 17-day time period in 1848 between the death of Francis R. Shunk and the swearing in of William F. Johnston. Governors and lieutenant governors are elected on the same ticket.
, five former governors are alive. The most recent death of a former governor was that of William Scranton (1963–1967), on July 28, 2013.

A Milliarium (plural milliaria) was a stone that was placed alongside Roman roads. Such stones were used from about the 3rd century BC. They marked the distance between two towns, and were placed at intervals of one Roman mile. This was about 1000 milia passum, or . In the celtic provinces, leagues are often used, these are 1500 milia passum, or about .
Very often the stones condain the following information:
Even if they look like modern road signs showing the distance to given places, this was probably not the first function of these stone pillars. What seems more likely is that they were used to show the power of the person who erected them; some were probably used for propaganda. Very often, the inscription of the emperor was in Latin, but the inscription of the distance was in Greek. The ordinary population could probably read the second part, but not the first. Today between 7.000 and 8.000 such stones are known.

Mount Pico () is a composite volcano (or stratovolcano); it is the highest point of the Portuguese island of Pico in the Azores. With an altitude of above sea level, it is more than twice the elevation of any other peak in the Azores, and the tallest mountain in Portugal.
Mount Pico is at the eastern end of Pico Island. On the top of the mountain, there is round crater about in diameter and deep. Inside this crater () there is a small elevation produced by a recent, in geological terms, eruption that is known with the name of Pico Pequeno or Piquinho, which is about high. From the base of Pico Pequeno, volcanic smoke gets out with a strong odor of sulfur.
In winter, the top of the mountain is covered with snow. Rains are frequent the whole year.
Mount Pico was made a "Natural Reserve" in 1982 to protect the mountain. The reserve () has an area of about 1,500 hectares (15 km) and is from about high to the top of the mountain.
There are trails for hiking and it is possible, for persons in good conditions and depending on weather, to get to the top of the mountain in around two to four hours from the beginning of the trail.
In the lower part of its slopes is the "Paisagem da Cultura da Vinha da Ilha do Pico" ("Landscape of the Pico Island Vineyard Culture"), classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage.

Electric violin

An electric violin is a string instrument which is played with a bow, like a normal violin. The strings are usually tuned to the notes G, D, A, and E, but it could have its pitches changed as it is electric. It is held between the left collar bone (near the shoulder) and the chin. Different notes are made by fingering with the left hand while bowing with the right. It has no frets or other markers. Players have to learn the exact place to put the fingers of the left hand and memorise them. Luthiers tend to fix electric violins as well.
The modern electric violin is about 10 years old. Similar string instruments have been around for almost 1,000 years. It became the most enjoyable electric instrument played along with the electric bass. It is used as a solo instrument, in rock and sometimes blues. It is also used in folk music.
An electric violin is normally not in the shape of a normal violin, but in wacky shapes and colours.

Navi Mumbai

Navi Mumbai is a planned satellite city of Mumbai, on the west coast of Maharashtra in India. It was developed in 1972 as a new urban township of Mumbai, and is currently the largest planned city in the world.
Navi Mumbai, located in the eastern harbour of Mumbai, is one of the world's largest planned townships. Since independence, there was a specific reason to build a new city on the mainland across the harbour: to lower the population of Mumbai, an island city whose physical expansion had a limit. It was regarded as an alternative for the many people who wanted to come to Mumbai from all over India. This decision required the Maharashtra government to relocate its seat of governance along with all its important offices to this new city, and completely stop the backbay reclamation project in the island city. It did not do this. It continued with the reclamation and put brakes on the efforts of CIDCO (such as the shifting of wholesale markets).
The planning of Navi Mumbai did not fully begin until 1971. South Navi Mumbai is being quickly developed with modern infrastructure in parts of Kharghar, Kamothe, New Panvel and Kalamboli.
The City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) was formed on 17 March 1971, under the Indian Companies Act, 1956. The area covered of the total of the Konkan coast. Privately owned land with 86 villages covering within the present limits of Navi Mumbai and further villages measuring an additional were acquired by the government of Maharashtra.
CIDCO carved out 14 nodes small townships with a view towards facilitating comprehensive development. These nodes are named Airoli, Ghansoli, Kopar Khairane, Vashi, Sanpada, Nerul, CBD Belapur, Kharghar, Kamothe, New Panvel, Taloja, Kalamboli, Ulwe, and Dronagiri. CIDCO acquired of land, of which was private land, salt-pan land and government land. By 2000, CIDCO had developed about of land. Of this land, is saleable under various land uses. CIDCO has sold about leaving a balance land for sale about under various land uses.
CIDCO planned and constructed all the railway stations in Navi Mumbai and developed nearby areas commercially.
In 1973, the Vashi bridge was opened to the public for residents of Vashi, CBD Belapur and Nerul. The Sion-Panvel Expressway was built to reduce the time taken to travel from Sion to Panvel. Initially there was not much response to the new city. Major changes took place only after 1990, with the commissioning of a wholesale agricultural produce market at Vashi and the construction of a commuter railway line from Mankhurd to Vashi in May 1992. These developments caused a sudden growth in economic activities and population in Navi Mumbai.
By the end of the 1990s, the planning authority of Navi Mumbai started private participation in the developmental activity of Navi Mumbai.
A new railway line between Nerul and Uran is under construction. Kharghar and Panvel are experiencing major infrastructural developments due to their being close to the proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport.
When Navi Mumbai was created in 1970s, CIDCO was the only authority that looked after the development and maintenance of the city. CIDCO made a developmental plan for Navi Mumbai covering 95 villages 
For the first ten years of the project CIDCO was the planning and administrative body, and as the developer and builder for the project. Taxes on property, land, commercial and water were payable to CIDCO. The 14 nodes which CIDCO created were named Airoli, Ghansoli, Kopar Khairane, Vashi, Sanpada, Nerul, CBD Belapur, Kharghar, Kamothe, New Panvel, Kalamboli, Ulwe, Pushpak and Dronagiri. Each of the nodes is divided into smaller groups called sectors.
Initially only Vashi, Nerul and CBD Belapur were developed by CIDCO with housing, schools and community centre roads. But after the arrival of the harbour railway line extension in 1990s, there was an increase in population. CIDCO shifted its development plan to nodes like Kharghar, Kamothe, New Panvel, and Kopar Khairane. In its new development plan, CIDCO land was allocated to builders for housing. CIDCO only provided basic infrastructure like roads, water and electricity, these nodes were developed mostly by private builders according to the CIDCO plan.
On 17 December 1991, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) was created by the state government for maintaining some of the developed nodes of Navi Mumbai.
Local self-government started on 1 January 1992. NMMC was handed nine of the 25 nodes of the Navi Mumbai project area for its administration. However, CIDCO, as a planning authority, has rights on the open plots in these five nodes.

Sedimentology

Sedimentology is the study of sediments such as sand, mud (silt), and clay. How they are laid down today is used to understand how rocks were formed. Sedimentologists use their understanding of modern processes to interpret sedimentary rocks and sedimentary structures.
Sedimentary rocks cover most of the Earth's surface, record much of the Earth's history, and contain the fossil record. Sedimentology is closely linked to stratigraphy, which is the study of the physical and temporal (time) relationships between rock layers or strata.
The idea that the processes affecting the earth today are the same as in the past is called uniformitarianism. It is the basis for finding out how sedimentary features in the rock record were formed. By comparing similar features today to features in the rock record—for example, by comparing modern sand dunes to dunes preserved in ancient aeolian sandstones—geologists reconstruct past environments.

Geological map

A geological or geologic map is a special-purpose map made to show geological features. William Smith was the man who first did the geological map of England.
Rock units or strata are shown by colour or symbols which show where they are exposed at the surface. Threee-dimensional features like faults, folds, with symbols which give these features' orientations.
Stratigraphic contour lines may be used to illustrate the surface of a selected strata illustrating the subsurface topographic trends of the strata. Isopach maps detail the variations in thickness of stratigraphic units. It is not always possible to show this properly: the strata may be extremely fractured, mixed, or otherwise disturbed. There are often gaps (discontinuities) where erosion has removed strata.

Help:Pipe trick

The pipe trick uses the pipe character ("") to save typing the label of a for several kinds of . This can help avoid making an error while typing the label.
When the last character of a link is the pipe character, the pipe trick will automatically generate the text that displays for that link. It removes any part of the link title that is inside parentheses, but it also processes commas in the title, and prefixes (e.g., "Help:"). The generated text is saved with the rest of the page's .
The pipe trick does not work in , within tags or tags. It also does not work in .
The pipe trick does not work with section links, and in general it does not work for links to anchors (links that use a # sign). For example, does not give you any wikilink.
You can achieve a similar effect for subpages by adding a slash.
Unlike the pipe trick, though, the slash trick is not expanded in the saved wiki markup.
This trick only works in namespaces where subpages are enabled.
If the title of the article you are editing includes a term in parentheses or a comma, placing a pipe at the start of a link will add that text to the end of the link target, but not display it.
For example, if the link Brush were placed in Broom (disambiguation), the link would be expanded to Brush
Placing a pipe at the start of a link to an article that has no parentheses or comma in its title will have no effect.

Maglite

Maglite is a brand of flashlight. There are several sizes available, ranging from a 6 D battery halogen flashlight to a single AAA battery keychain flashlight. They are made in the USA.
Most Maglite parts are made from anodized aluminum. There is a chrome-plated plastic reflector inside an aluminum housing at the top. Underneath the reflector is the light bulb or LED, which is attached to an aluminum tube. The batteries are inside the aluminum tube. A screw-on aluminum cap with a chrome-plated steel spring on the bottom of the flashlight holds the batteries in, and is unscrewed to replace the batteries. The spring is also the connection to the negative terminal (anode) on the batteries. There is no wire carrying the current to the bulb at the top of the flashlight - the aluminum tube is the conductor. On the smaller flashlights, the flashlight is turned on by slightly unscrewing the flashlight head. The larger flashlights have a push-button switch on the side of the aluminum tube.

The second generation of video game consoles began in 1976. The second generation began with the release of the Fairchild Channel F and Radofin Electronics' 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System. This generation is sometimes called the "early 8-bit era". Many consoles were released in the second generation. The Atari 2600 was the most popular video game console for much of the second generation. Other consoles such as Intellivision, the Odyssey 2, and ColecoVision were also popular.
The second generation ended in 1984. This was because of the video game crash of 1983. As of 2004, the Atari 2600 has sold 30 million units. As of 1990, the Intellivision had sold 3 million units. As of April 1984, the ColecoVision had sold 2 million units. As of 1977, the Fairchild Channel F had sold 250,000 units.
The first handheld game consoles was the Microvision designed by Smith Engineering. It was distributed and sold by Milton-Bradley in 1979. It was the first handheld game console that could use different game cartridges. The microvision had a small LCD display. There were only a few games that could be played with this system. It was discontinued two years later.
The Epoch Game Pocket Computer was released in Japan in 1984. The game system did not sell very well. Because of this, only five games were made for it. Nintendo's Game & Watch was more successful. It was very popular until it was discontinued in 1991.

In the third generation the displays changed from single-screen (or flip-screen) graphics to scrolling graphics.
The best-selling console of this generation was the NES/Famicom. This was followed by the Sega Master System and the Atari 7800. The NES/Famicom system remained the best-selling home console until the PlayStation in 1996. Some of the consoles in the third generation used 8-bit processors. However, systems like the Mega Drive/Genesis used 16-bit processors. The NES/Famicom system was the most popular video game console in the United States.

The fifth generation of video game consoles began in 1993 and ended in 2002. The fifth generation was also called the 32-bit, 64-bit or the 3D generation of video game consoles. Throughout the fifth generation, only three consoles were among the most popular video game consoles in this era. These consoles include, the Sega Saturn (1994), the PlayStation (1994), and the Nintendo 64 (1996). In different parts of the world, console sales varied widely. However, the PlayStation was the best-selling system of the fifth generation. The 3DO, Atari Jaguar, Amiga CD32 and PC-FX and other consoles were also part of this generation. However, those systems were not very successful. 
The handheld game consoles of the fifth generation were not that successful. The first handheld, Sega Nomad had a lifespan of two years. The Virtual Boy only had less than one year. Both of them were discontinued. Nintendo's Game Boy Color became the best-selling handheld video console of the fifth generation. There were two updated versions of the original Game Boy Color such as the Game Boy Light (Japan only) and the Game Boy Pocket.
Bit ratings for consoles no longer mattered in this generation. However, the Nintendo 64 continued to inform others that it had 64-bit processing power. The Nintendo 64 tried to out perform the Atari Jaguar by referencing its 64-bit power. The number of "bits" in console names referred to the CPU word size. It had been used by hardware marketers as a "show of power" for many years. The fifth generation saw the increase of emulation. The development of the Internet made it possible to save and download tape and ROM images of older games. This led the seventh generation consoles to make many older games available for purchase or download.

In Christianity, the Great White Throne Judgment is the time when the dead people that did not live during the 1,000 years that Satan was inside the bottomless pit come back to life and are judged by God according to their works using the 66 books of the Bible. This judgment is for those people who are not found written in the Book of Life, a book where the names of those who are going to heaven are written. Once the judgment has been finished, Death, Hades, and those who are not found written in the Book of Life will be cast into the Lake of Fire.
Below, Revelation 20:11-15 is written to show the section of the Bible this judgment appears in.
11 Then I saw a Great White Throne and the one sitting on it. The earth and the heavens fled away from His presence, and there was no place found for them. 12 And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before the throne, and the books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the

Fibrinogen

Fibrinogen is the clotting element present in blood. When blood comes out of a wound in a vessel, the fibrinogen is activated and forms fibrin, which clots the blood. Although this is fibrinogen's main job, it also forms bridges between platelets. Fibrinogen is a protein made by the liver. It is a dimer (made up of two similar units). Each unit has an alpha, beta, and gamma chain. The alpha and beta chains have a small peptide called fibrinopeptide. 
When fibrinogen is activated to form fibrin, an enzyme called thrombin cleaves the fibrinopeptides off of the alpha and beta chains.
It is possible to examine a small sample of a person's blood to find out how much fibrinogen is in the blood. This helps medical professionals to know if too much or too little fibrinogen is the cause of a patient's medical problems.

Coriaria myrtifolia

Coriaria myrtifolia, called in English redoul, is a plant with poisonus fruits and whose leaves were traditionally used as raw material in tanning (making leather out of skins).
The Spanish name "emborrachacabras" (that is, "getting goats drunk") refers to the leaves' effect on goats that eat them. The French name ("redoul") and Catalan name ("roldor") come from Latin "Rhus tyrius" (Syrian or Tyrian sumac), referring to the leaves use in the traditional tannery industry.
"C. myrtifolia" is a shrub to 2–3 m tall without hairs and with shiny leaves like the leaves of the myrtle ("myrtifolia" means "leaves like the leaves of the myrtle"). It produces small greenish flowers in spring (April to June) in racemes (a kind of inflorescence).
It produces fruits in early summer. The fruits look like berries but they are small nuts (achenes) protected by enlarged and colored petals; it is the same of all the species of the genus "Coriaria". Fruits cannot be eaten because their seeds are very poisonous.
The plants of redoul can fix nitrogen from the air because they have bacteria in their roots.
"C. myrtifolia" is found only around the western Mediterranean Sea, not too far from the coast but near rivers:

It was carrying about 1,800 Jewish refugees from Europe during World War II. The British government were deporting them from Palestine to Mauritius because they did not have visas. Zionist organisations opposed the deportation, and the paramilitary group Haganah planted a bomb in the ship to stop it from leaving Haifa. However, the Haganah miscalculated the size of the explosion: it killed 260 people and injured 172. The rest of the passengers were rescued by British and Arab boats that rushed to save them.
The British allowed the survivors to remain in Palestine on humanitarian grounds. 221 passengers were buried in the Carmel Beach cemetery in Haifa.

The More children travelled as indentured servants to 3 of the "Mayflower" Pilgrims. Ellen, age 8, was assigned to Edward Winslow. She died soon after the ship landed. Jasper, age 7, was a servant of John Carver. Jasper died in December of 1620 while the "Mayflower" was in Harbor. He was buried ashore in what is now the Provincetown area. There is a memorial with his name and that of four others who also died at sea or while the ship was anchored at Cape Cod Harbor in November and December of 1620. Mary, age 4, died soon after the ship landed. Richard resided with the William Brewster family until about mid-1627.The 3 children died of something that was called the ‘common infection’ because so many people died of the same illness. Only Richard survived. 
More and his sisters and brother left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on 21 November. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.
More was 6 when the "Mayflower" landed at Plymouth Colony. When he stepped on land, he worked with all of the others to help gather supplies for food and shelter and to bury the dead. In the spring of 1621, he attended the first Thanksgiving. Nothing is known of More during the years he lived with the Brewster family from 1620 to 1627, except that his name is on a document giving adults cattle and other livestock.
More was working for Isaac Allerton in 1628. Allerton traded goods and supplies over long distances He fished near Plymouth and Maine. Later he became captain on the ships that supplied the new American colonies.
By early 1642, More joined the Salem church. As a member of this Church he would be allowed to give his opinion and to vote on important matters in Salem. 
By the age of twenty-four, More was a captain of his own small ship and traded with the colonies, the West Indies, and England. He moved to Salem Neck Massachusetts and set up his own fishing stand.Drinking water was scarce so More dug a well for himself but allowed all others to use it. He traded tobacco and other merchandise and supplies with Virginia and the West Indies, and made voyages to England.
More took part in sea battles against the French in 1664. They were trying to prevent the early colonist from fishing and trading goods and supplies that the colonists needed to live. This was in an area called the Hudson River region. In 1654 More also was in another Naval battle against the French at Port Royal, Virginia.
More rescued the colonists at the new colony at Cape Fear, North Carolina in 1665.. The people there were dying because they had no food and not enough clothes to keep them warm. The waters around Cape Fear were (and still are) very dangerous for ships yet More brought a shipment of food and supplies to aid them when other captains failed or refused to try. 
Richard and his wife Christian Hunter More had 7 children: Samuel, Thomas, Caleb, Richard Jr., Joshua, Susanna, and Christian.
Christian More died March 18, 1676 in Salem.
More died in 1696. His gravestone gives his age as 84, but he did not know his exact birth date.More lived longer than any other male passenger of the "Mayflower". He is buried in the Charter Street Burial Ground in Salem, Massachusetts. He is the only Mayflower passenger to have his gravestone where it was originally placed sometime in the mid-1690s. Also buried nearby in the same cemetery were his two wives, Christian Hunter More and Jane More.
In recent years, More's metal spoon was found during the excavation of the original Plymouth Colony site. His initials were carved into it.

Sacrament of marriage

The sacrament of marriage in the Catholic Church is the marriage contract between two baptized persons of the opposite sex. Each person acquires the irrevocable and exclusive right over the body of the other for the purposes of procreation. Marriage ends with the death of either person. The sacrament of marriage is regulated by divine law, church law, and civil law. The Roman Catholic church does not perform or recognize same-sex marriages. Religions other than Roman Catholicism have different regulations and customs governing marriage.

Marriage

Marriage is a union between individual people. It is like a contract. Sometimes people also call this matrimony. The fact of being married is called wedlock. Very often, people celebrate that they are getting married. The ceremony is usually called a wedding. 
In most of the world, this is a union between a man and a woman (who become husband and wife). However, such ceremonies can occur between same-sex couples. A civil marriage is secular and is performed by a government official. A religious marriage may be performed by clergy.
The most common form of marriage is a legally binding heterosexual union. Some societies recognize polygamy and polyandry. In polygamy, a man may be married to many women; in polyandry a woman may be married to many men. In Senegal, for example, nearly 47 percent of marriages are multiple. A temporary marriage is called a wedlease.
There are many reasons why people marry, but they usually include one or more of the following:
Marriage usually leads to rights and obligations to those married, these may include:
Marriage is also about sexual intercourse; being unable to have sex, being unwilling to have sex, or having sex outside the marriage may be a reason to undo the marriage.
Often there is also a spiritual part of marriage. In addition to the civil act (wanted by the state) there is sometimes a religious one. A Christian marriage ceremony usually happens in a church. There are certain restrictions on who can marry or be married; those closely related, like brothers and sisters usually cannot marry. This is usually to prevent genetic problems for the children. Those marrying also have to be of a certain age to be able to marry. If that age is not specified it is usually the age of consent. In Hinduism marriage is considered to be holy and is seen as a union of the goddess "Laxmi" and the god "Narayan".
Some countries and religious communities also permit the union of two partners of the same sex. This is generally known as same-sex marriage. In the Netherlands, the marriage law was changed to allow such unions, called "Marriage". Other countries that allow them sometimes have a different name for them.

Tom Lehrer

Tom Lehrer (born 9 April 1928), also known as Thomas Andrew Lehrer, is an American singer-songwriter, pianist and mathematician. Lehrer is known for his very funny songs which were written in the 1950s and 1960s. Many people consider him a genius because of the hilarious lyrics in his songs. He is known for songs such as Pollution and notably "The elements" which is a list of the chemical elements that are,as he says, "Set to a possibly recognizable tune," which is, in this case, the "Major-General's Song".
There has been a heated debate between Tom Lehrer fans and Georg Kreisler fans about who wrote which song first? Kreisler wrote "Die Hand" which had many features that were the same with "I hold your hand in mine" which was written by Lehrer. Another song was "Taubenvergiften im Park" which is also very similar to "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park" by Lehrer. This debate has gone for years, and because both had denied from copying each other's idea, it cannot be decided if Kreisler wrote it first or Lehrer. According to Lehrer himself, he said it was not fair that Kreisler gets to get a recording before he gets to do his. Despite this being vital evidence against him, he claims that he done this song long before the recording was made in concerts around America.
Lehrer earned his AB in Mathematics in 1946, and an MA degree the following year. He wrote the songs: "New Math" and "That's Mathematics" to show his passion for the subject.

Stephen Hopkins (Mayflower passenger)

Stephen Hopkins (15811644) He was a passenger on the "Mayflower" in 1620, and signed the Mayflower Compact. He was also an assistant to the Governor of Plymouth Colony in 1636. 
Hopkins was born in 1581 at Upper Clatford, Hampshire, England and was the son of John and Elizabeth Hopkins. He worked as a tanner and merchant.
There is little information about his early life. He married a woman named Mary and they had three children: Elizabeth, Constance, and Giles.
On June 2, 1609 Hopkins sailed over the Atlantic Ocean for Jamestown, Virginia on the "Sea Venture". This was the head ship of a group of ships lead by Sir George Somers. The "Sea Venture" was carrying the new Jamestown governor, Thomas Gates, and was also delivering supplies to Jamestown. 
The ships were on the sea for nearly two months when a severe storm that lasted for five days caused the ships to become separated. The "Sea Venture" was badly damaged and about to sink. They saw land which was the island of Bermuda. They made it to land but were shipwrecked on the island. Fortunately there was much food and water.
In September 1, 1609, they built a long boat and sent 8 men out to try to reach Jamestown to get help but that boat never returned.
In late November 1609, they begin repairing smaller boats enough to take everyone off the island and continue to Jamestown. Hopkins and other people did not agree with Captain Gates and did not think he was a good leader. They had a dispute and Hopkins was charged with mutiny. He was sentenced to death but the people on the ship begged the Captain to take mercy and Hopkins was forgiven.
The settlers in Jamestown did not get along with the Native Americans and they also refused to farm and grow food. They sometimes cheated the Native Americans and they turned against the settlers with violence which lasted for years.
On May 10, 1610, Hopkins and others left the island of Bermuda and came to Jamestown eleven days later. The people in Jamestown were starving to death. They were afraid to go outside the fort and were tearing down their houses for firewood. They were not planting crops. They also refused to trade with the Native Americans or to fish. When he arrived from Bermuda, Governor Gates estimated there was only days worth of food left. He decided to sail to Newfoundland and then went to England. Just as they were preparing to depart, an English ship came into the harbor with supplies and new settlers along with a new governor, Lord de la Warr. The colonists were forced to return and reestablish their fort.
William Shakespeare wrote a play called "The Tempest" in November 1611. It is about a group of passengers being shipwrecked by a mighty storm. That play has a character that was supposed to be Stephen Hokpins.
Back in England, Hopkins' wife Mary unexpectedly died in May 1613, leaving her three young children all alone. Hopkins returned to England to care for his children. Some time later, he married his second wife Elizabeth Fisher.
When Hopkins learned of the planned ‘’Mayflower’’ voyage to Northern Virginia to establish a colony, he decided he would like to go.
The children of Stephen and Elizabeth Hopkins were Damaris, Oceanus, Caleb, Deborah, Damaris, Ruth and Elizabeth. Oceanus was born during the voyage.
Hopkins left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" spotted land. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was damaged and they were forced to land 21 November at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. Hopkins signed the Mayflower Compact.
Hopkins and other men went to land to explore the area for a place where everyone could live. Hopkins was very valuable because he had experience from his time at Jamestown.
One of the earliest missions included William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish , Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edwary Doty. Bradford wrote that they set off in freezing weather, "and when the set sail the salt spray froze on their coats, as if they had been glazed". Of this group Hopkins was the most experienced havings spent time at Jamestown. During their trip they observed Native Americans who appeared to be cutting up a large whale but when they saw the men approaching the natives fled. 
Hopkins taught the pilgrims to hunt and to make friends with the Native Americans. The first meeting with the Native Americans Samoset and Massasoit was held at Hopkins’ house. Over the years Hopkins was a great help to colony leaders such as Myles Standish and Edward Winslow.
Stephen Hopkins died sometime between June 6, 1644 and July 17th of that year. He made his will on June 6, 1644 and requested that he be buried next to his deceased wife, Elizabeth. The inventory was taken on July 17, 1644 and besides his deceased wife, he mentions sons Giles and Caleb, daughter Constance, wife of Nicholas Snow, daughters Deborah, Damaris, Ruth and Elizabeth.
The burial place of Stephen Hopkins is unknown."

Vili, however, was loyal to Odin. Since Odin wore gold armour, his brothers Vili wore silver and Vé wore bronze. When Odin threw Vé into the underworld, Vé's armour was taken from him. Eventually, when Ragnarök began, Vé was given back his armour, sword, and powers to join Odin and Vili on a quest to kill the wolf Fenrir. When Fenrir swallowed Odin, his brother Vili thought the war was over and there were no hope so he sacrificed himself to Fenrir. Vé fled after Vili sacrificed himself, but Fenrir found him in the realm of the elves and ate him. However some people may say that Fenrir never ate Vé and that he was shot in the head with an arrow by an elf who had mistaken him for his nephew Loki.

Ensete

Ensete is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is one of the three genera in the banana family, Musaceae, and includes the false banana or enset ("E. ventricosum"), an economically important foodcrop in Ethiopia.
The genus "Ensete" was first described by Paul Fedorowitsch Horaninow (1796-1865) in his "Prodromus Monographiae Scitaminarum" of 1862 in which he created a single species, "Ensete edule". However, the genus did not receive general recognition until 1947 when it was revived by E. E. Cheesman in the first of a series of papers in the "Kew Bulletin" on the classification of the bananas, with a total of 25 species.
Taxonomically, the genus "Ensete" has been reduced since Cheesman restore the taxon. Cheesman acknowledged that field study might reveal synonymy and the most recent review of the genus by Simmonds (1960) listed just six. The Plant List accepts eight species as valid.
The plants of "Ensete" are very large herbs without branches that die after producing seeds; They have only one stem that remains short until flowering.
They have very big leaves; the lower parts of the leaves form a false stem so they look as trees. Their fruits are leathery and dry berries with few big and hard seeds.
It is possible to separate "Ensete" into its African and Asian species.

Charles Fremantle

Admiral Sir Charles Howe Fremantle GCB RN (1 June 1800 – 25 May 1869) was a British Royal Navy officer. The city of Fremantle in Western Australia is named after him.
Fremantle was the son of Admiral Thomas Fremantle, a friend of Nelson. His mother was Elizabeth, the diarist. He was a nephew of William Henry Fremantle. His elder brother was Thomas Fremantle, 1st Baron Cottesloe. His middle name, Howe, is because his birth date was the anniversary of Lord Howe's victory over the French on the Glorious First of June in 1794. He joined the Royal Navy in 1812.
Fremantle was charged with raping a 15-year-old girl in April 1826. To avoid a scandal, his family paid off witnesses and put pressure on the judge. In August 1826 he was promoted to captain. In 1828 he was given command of the 26-gun frigate HMS "Challenger", and sent to claim the west coast of Australia for the United Kingdom.
HMS "Challenger" left the Cape of Good Hope on 20 March 1829. It arrived in Cockburn Sound on 2 May, and Fremantle went ashore at Garden Island. One week later, Fremantle raised the British flag at the mouth of the Swan River and claimed Western Australia for King George IV.
The new lieutenant governor James Stirling arrived in Cockburn Sound on 2 June on the "Parmelia", bring 69 new settlers. They planned to start a colony at the Swan River in Western Australia. On 8 June they were joined by 56 officers and men from the HMS "Sulphur". On 17 June, Stirling read out loud a legal document which supported Fremantle's earlier proclamation. This was the beginning of the history of Western Australia as a British colony, and later as a state of federal Australia.
Fremantle left the Swan River Colony on 25 August 1829, for the British Army base of Trincomalee, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) where he was based the next couple of years.
While he was there he visited many places including Kowloon. He told the British government that this would be a good site for a British settlement. They agreed and Hong Kong was settled in 1841.
On his way back to England in September 1832, he made his second and final visit to the Swan River Colony.
In 1833 he stopped at Pitcairn Island, where he attempted to make peace in the leadership dispute between Joshua Hill and George Hunn Nobbs.
In 1843 he was given command of HMS "Inconstant" in the Mediterranean Fleet and in 1847 he took command of HMS "Albion". In 1853 he became Captain of HMS "Juno" on the Australia Station.
In 1855 he served as Rear-Admiral controlling the naval transport service for the Crimean War from Balaklava (a city in the Ukraine).
In July 1858 he was given command of the Channel Squadron and in 1863 he became Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth.
He married Isabella Wedderburn on 8 October 1836. They had three children:
He died in 1869 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

The Carcharodontosauridae were a family of carnivorous theropod dinosaurs. They are a clade in the Carnosauria. Carcharodontosaurids included some of the largest land predators ever known: "Giganotosaurus", "Mapusaurus", "Carcharodontosaurus", and "Tyrannotitan". All of these rivalled or exceeded "Tyrannosaurus" in size.
Together with the spinosaurids, carcharodontosaurids were the largest predators in the early and middle Cretaceous throughout Gondwana. They were also in North America ("Acrocanthosaurus"), and Asia ("Shaochilong").
Their ages range from 127 to 93 million years ago (mya). After that, they may have been replaced by the smaller abelisaurids in Gondwana and by tyrannosaurids in North America and Asia. If so, this faunal replacement occurred on a global scale.
However, some theropod teeth discovered in the late Cretaceous of Brazil, as well as a fragment of right maxilla appear to belong to carcharodontosaurids. This suggests the group survived until the latest Cretaceous.
In December 2011, Oliver Rauhut described a new genus and species of carcharodontosaurid from the Upper Jurassic (late Kimmeridgian to earliest Tithonian, about 154150 mya) of southeastern Tanzania. "Veterupristisaurus" is the oldest known carcharodontosaurid.

The Siderian is the first geological period in the Palaeoproterozoic that began 2.5 billion years ago, and ended at 2.3 billion years ago. Before it was the Neoarchaean It is followed by the Rhyacian.
Banded iron formations (BIFs) became very abundant early this period. BIFs were formed as anaerobic algae produced waste oxygen that combined with iron, forming magnetite (FeO, an iron oxide). This process cleared iron from the oceans, presumably turning greenish seas clear. Eventually, without an oxygen sink in the oceans, the process created the oxygen-rich atmosphere of today. This event is known as the oxygen catastrophe, which according to some geologists triggered the Huronian glaciation. The Huronian glaciation took place in the Siderian between 2400 Mya and 2300 Mya.

The Neoarchaean (Neoarchean) is the last geological era in the Archaean eon. It began 2.8 billion years ago and ended at 2.5 billion years ago. Before it was the Mesoarchaean and before the Palaeoproterozoic. 
Oxygenic photosynthesis first evolved in this era. This led to an oxygen catastrophe in the Palaeoproterozoic. It was caused by a poisonous buildup of oxygen in the atmosphere. This was created by oxygen-producing photoautotrophs that evolved in the Neoarchaean. The supercontinent Kenorland formed during this period, about 2.7 billion years ago.

Fossils from Australia show that stromatolites have lived on Earth since the Mesoarchaean. The Pongola glaciation occurred at 2.9 billion years ago. The first supercontinent Vaalbara broke up during this time around 3.2 billion years ago. The second supercontinent Ur existed during this era at 3.1 billion years ago.

The Palaeoarchaean (Paleoarchean) is the second geological era in the Archaean. It began 3.6 billion years ago and ended at 3.2 billion years ago. Before it was the Eoarchaean and after it was the Mesoarchaean. 
The name comes from the Greek word "palaios". "Palaios" means "ancient". The oldest fossil life forms are cyanobacteria found in strata 3.46 billion years old. These rocks are in Western Australia. 
The first supercontinent, Vaalbara, formed during this period.

<doc id="400696" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=400696" title="Eoarchaean">
Eoarchaean

The Eoarchaean (Eoarchean) is the 1st geological era in the Archaean that began 4 billion years ago, and ended at 3.6 billion years ago. Before it was the Hadean It is followed by the Palaeoarchaean. 
The Eoarchaean is the earliest period of geology after the solidification of Earth's crust. The abiotic origins of life (abiogenesis) have been dated to a time window from 4 to 3.6 billion years ago when atmospheric pressure values ranged from 100 to 10 bar.
It was formerly officially unnamed and usually referred to as the first part of the "Early Archaean" (now an obsolete name) together with the later Palaeoarchaean Era. It is the first part of the Archaean Eon, preceded by the Hadean Eon.
The Eoarchaean was followed by the Palaeoarchaean Era.
The name comes from two Greek words: "eos" (dawn) and "archaios" (ancient). The 1st supercontinent Vaalbara appeared around the end of this period around 3.6 billion years ago.
A characteristic of the Eoarchean is that Earth possessed a firm crust for the first time. However, this crust may have been incomplete at many sites and areas of lava may have existed at the surface. The beginning of the Eoarchaean is characterized by heavy asteroid bombardment within the inner solar system: the Late Heavy Bombardment. The Eoarchaean is the first phase of our planet from which solid rock formations survived. The largest is the Isua greenstone belt at the southwest coast of Greenland. It appeared during the Eoarchaean around 3.8 billion years ago. The Acasta Gneiss within the Canadian Shield have been dated to be 4.03 Ga and are therefore the oldest preserved rock formations. In 2008 another rock formation was discovered in the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt in northern Québec in Canada which has been dated to be 4.28 Ga. These formations are presently under intense investigation.
Today it seems well supported that the first oceans existed during the Eoarchean.

Archie Barton

Dr Archie Barton, AM (March 1936 – 18 October 2008) was an Aboriginal Australian activist. He fought for land rights and compensation for the Maralinga Tjarutja people against the Australian and British governments in the 1980s and 1990s. He played an important role in the 20-year campaign of the Maralinga people regaining access to their land after the British nuclear weapons tests.
Barton was born in South Australia in March 1936; the exact date is unknown. He was born at a siding on the east-west Trans-Australian Railway line, about east of Ooldea. His mother was a Pitjantjatjara woman from the Maralinga lands. It is not known who his father was, and Barton never knew him, but he is believed to have been a White railway worker. He was given the surname "Barton" because that was the name of the siding where he was born (Barton Siding). Archie spent his infancy in the care of his mother at Ooldea, which at the time was a mission station for Aboriginal people.
At the age of five, Barton became a victim of the Stolen Generations. He was taken from his mother and placed into a children's home in Port Augusta run by the Christian Brethren. When he was captured, he was hiding behind the skirt of Daisy Bates, a well-known writer who was living near Ooldea at the time. Archie never saw his mother again.
He was taught by the Christian Brethren until he was 12 years old. After this, he was sent to work on agricultural stations. He worked at a number of stations during his teenage years, and was often aggravated at being treated differently to White workers. After this, he worked several jobs as a labourer, including on the railway. In his twenties, Barton moved to Adelaide where he worked digging trenches for the South Australian Gas Company. While there, he became an alcoholic, got tuberculosis and spent a year in a sanitorium. By the time he was in his thirties, his addiction to alcohol was so bad that a doctor gave him six months to live. He immediately gave up drinking, and later began working for an Aboriginal alcohol-rehabilitation service in Port Augusta.
During the 1950s and 1960s, the British government tested nuclear weapons at the Woomera Test Range in central South Australia. The first two bombs were exploded at Emu Field, located to the north of Maralinga, in 1953. Major tests were done at Maralinga in 1956 and 1957, and multiple smaller tests were made up until 1963. Barton was still a young man at the time. Maralinga was Barton's mother's country, and remains the homeland of the Maralinga Tjarutja people. Most of the indigenous families living in these lands were forced to move out of the area before the major tests began. They were placed in Aboriginal missions and settlements built by the government.
One of these settlements was Yalata, located far to the south. The community at Ooldea was relocated there in 1952. In 1981, Barton was chosen as a community adviser for Yalata. Four years later, in January 1985, the government of South Australia handed back the native title to the Maralinga Tjarutja lands. Barton was appointed administrator of the newly created Maralinga Land Rights Council. However, the land remained contaminated from the nuclear waste and was not fit to be lived in.
In his role as administrator, Barton led the Maralinga people in their campaign to get the land cleaned and restored so that they could safely return to living there. He represented his people before many enquiries and commissions, in both Canberra and London. A royal commission into the nuclear tests was done by the Australian government. This was the McClelland Royal Commission, for which Barton helped provide evidence. Ten years later, in 1995, the government paid the community AU$13.5 million in compensation. Barton and two elders travelled to London in 1991 and 1992, to negotiate with the British government. They met with the leader of the House of Lords, Viscount Cranborne, to whom Barton presented two bags of soil from Maralinga, tainted with plutonium.
The clean-up of the land was estimated to cost over AU$100 million. It took several years before the British offered an acceptable contribution, which was about £20 million. The clean-up was completed in 2000, but the test sites themselves will remain poisonous for many thousands of years.
Barton served as the administrator of the Maralinga Land Rights Council for 20 years (1985–2005). He was forced to resign the office in 2005, when it was discovered that he had stolen $230,000 of community money. His friends blamed old age and the stress of financial demands from his relatives. His reputation and position in the community was destroyed, and he became poor, unhealthy and an outcast. He lived in sheds in Whyalla and Port Augusta during this time. He was welcomed back into the community shortly before his death, but by that time he was already very weak.
Barton died on 18 October 2008, in Ceduna. He was buried at Oak Valley, the new settlement built near Maralinga when the traditional owners returned to their lands. He no children of his own, but looked after the children and grandchildren of his long-term partner Mary Harrison.
Barton was awarded the South Australian Aboriginal of the Year in 1988, and was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1989. In 1996, he was given an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Adelaide.
In 2001, he became one of the founding members of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. He served as a member of the National Indigenous Council from 2004 to 2005. He also served as a director of Imparja Television, the national Aboriginal broadcasting network.

La Soufrière (“The Sulfurer”) or Soufrière Saint Vincent is an active volcano on the island of Saint Vincent in the Windward Islands of the Caribbean.
At , La Soufrière is the highest peak on Saint Vincent as well as the highest point in the island country of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
It is in the northern part of the island of Saint Vincent in the Saint David and Charlotte parishes. The mountain is surrounded by the towns of Wallibou and Chateaubelair to the southwest, Fancy to the north, Orange Hill and Georgetown to the southeast and the Richmond Peak and Mount Brisbane to the south.
Soufrière is an active composite volcano (or stratovolcano) with a lake in the crater and is the island's youngest and northernmost volcano. It has a main crater of 1.6 km in diameter, with the northeast edge cut by another smaller crater in 1812.
The first historical eruption of the volcano took place during 1718; it and the 1812 eruption produced major explosions. Much of the northern end of the island was devastated by a major eruption in 1902 that killed 1,680 people; this eruption was just hours before the eruption of Mount Pelée on Martinique.
The last recorded eruption was in April 1979; due to advance warning there were no casualties.
Several volcanoes in the Caribbean are named Soufrière (French: "sulphur outlet"). Two of them are Soufrière Hills on Montserrat and La Grande Soufrière on Guadeloupe.

Western Australian Party

The Western Australian Party (WAP) was an Australian political party that operated in 1906. It was a liberal party which wanted to protect the rights of Western Australians and oppose the Labour Party. Its supporters came from the Protectionist Party and the Anti-Socialist Party. John Forrest, a minister in Alfred Deakin's government, became leader the party. Candidates were selected for all electorates in the 1906 federal election. By the time the election was held, support for the party had ceased. Forrest was elected, but not as a WAP member. However, the party did elect one member, William Hedges, as the member for Fremantle. He was a member of the WAP, although he sat as an independent and, like Forrest, joined the Commonwealth Liberal Party when it began in 1909.
The party policies were explained in a 12 point program. Many of these were to promote the interests of Western Australia as a member of the new Australian federation. This included keeping as much government revenue as possible. It also included items important to Western Australia such as coastal defence, and building a railway to the eastern states. It also wanted to introduce deciaml currency, and metric weights and measures.

École Centrale de Lille

École Centrale de Lille is a renowned graduate engineering school in France. It is in a campus of the University of Lille (Northern France).
Its different curricula lead to the following French & European degrees :
Academic activities and industrial applied research are performed mainly in French and English languages. Students from a dozen of nationalities participate to the different curricula at École Centrale de Lille.
Most of the 1500 graduate engineer students at École Centrale de Lille live in dedicated residential buildings nearby research labs and metro public transports on a campus that is shared with 20,000 students from Lille University of Science and Technology.
École Centrale de Lille was founded as École des arts industriels et des mines de Lille in 1854, with support from scientists such as Frédéric Kuhlmann and Louis Pasteur. It succeeded to the municipal chairs of experimental physics, applied chemistry and mechanics that were established in 1817. It became a technical university in 1872 with the integration of the Institut industriel du Nord. Since mid 19th century, the Baccalauréat and completion of undergraduate studies have been a prerequisite for admission. The initial focus was on civil engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry and manufacturing engineering. Electrical engineering full courses were added in 1892, automobile design has been taught from 1899 onwards. More than 200 students graduated in year 1914. Aerodynamics studies started in 1930. A stress on automatic control and computers was initiated in 1957. Later came courses and research in computer science (1957), supply chain management, materials science, micro-electronics, telecommunications, nanotechnologies (1994).
Since early 20th century, student admission has been based on a competitive exam after attending a French classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles or similar undergraduate studies.
It was originally in Lille central district. It then moved in 1968 in the modern campus of Lille University of Science and Technology, in the south-east suburb of Lille.
Admission to the Centralien engineering Programme implemented at École Centrale de Lille is possible after two/three year scientific undergraduate studies and requires success to either: 
The Centralien Programme typically lasts three years and results in a Master degree, augmented with international experience. Thus undergraduate studies + the Centralien Programme account for more than a cumulated 300 ECTS credits as applicable in the European education system.
However, graduate students enrolled in the TIME double degree procedure are required to spend two-years at École Centrale de Lille and spend two years in the TIME-partner institute for a total of four years resulting in a double master degree.
Research activities at École Centrale de Lille relate to the following topics:

Observable universe

In Big Bang cosmology, the observable universe is what, in theory, can be seen from Earth. That is light, or other signals, which has had time to reach the Earth since the beginning of the cosmological expansion. The observable universe is a spherical volume (a ball) centered on the observer, regardless of the shape of the universe as a whole. Every place in the universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one centered on Earth.
The word "observable" does not depend on whether modern technology actually allows detection of radiation from an object in this region. It simply means that it is possible "in principle" for light or other signals from the object to reach an observer on Earth. In practice, there is much that we cannot see. We can see light only from as far back as when particles were first able to emit photons that were not quickly re-absorbed by other particles. Before then, the universe was filled with a plasma that was opaque to photons. 
Sometimes astrophysicists distinguish between the "visible" universe, which includes only signals emitted since recombination—and the "observable" universe, which includes signals since the beginning of the cosmological expansion (that is, the end of the inflationary epoch in modern cosmology). The radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0 billion parsecs (about 45.7 billion light years), while the comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is about 14.3 billion parsecs (about 46.6 billion light years), about 2% larger.
The best estimate of the age of the universe as of 2013 is 13.798 ± 0.037 billion years. Due to the expansion of the universe humans are observing objects that were originally much closer but are now considerably farther away (as defined in terms of cosmological proper distance, which is equal to the comoving distance at the present time) than a static 13.8 billion light-years distance. The diameter of the observable universe is estimated at about 28 billion parsecs (93 billion light-years), putting the edge of the observable universe at about 46–47 billion light-years away.

The Brezhnev Doctrine was a policy promoted by Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. It said that the Soviet Union had the right to use military force to maintain the strict rule of the Communist Party in nearby socialist countries. The Brezhnev Doctrine was used to justify the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 after Alexander Dubček introduced political reforms there. The policy was maintained through 1989.

Comédie-Française

The Comédie-Française or Théâtre-Français is one of the few state theatres in France. It is the only state theatre to have its own company of actors. The company's primary venue is the Salle Richelieu. The theatre is part of the Palais-Royal complex at 2 rue de Richelieu on the Place André-Malraux in the 1st arrondissement of Paris.
The theatre has also been known as the "Théâtre de la République" and "La maison de Molière" (English: House of Molière). It inherited the latter name from the troupe of the best-known playwright associated with the Comédie-Française, Molière. He was considered the patron of French actors. He died seven years before “La maison de Molière” was rechristened the “Comédie-Française,” and the company continued to be known popularly by the former name long after the official change of name.
The Comédie-Française today has a repertoire of 3,000 works and three theatre locations in Paris (salle Richelieu; théâtre du Vieux-Colombier; Studio-Théâtre)

William Brewster

Col. William Brewster III (1566 – April 10, 1644) was an English official who was a passenger on the "Mayflower" in 1620. He was a religious leader both in Europe and in Plymouth Colony. He was also one of the signers of the Mayflower Compact. 
William Brewster III was the son of Capt. William Brewster, Jr. (1533-1622) and Mary Smythe Simkinson (1537-1655), Capt. William Brewster, Jr. was the son of Col. William Brewster, Sr. (1500-1616) and Maud Mann (1506-1619), William III lived in Scrooby, Nottinghamshire, England.
Brewster studied at Peterhouse, Cambridge. Cambridge was a university where many people wanted to change the Church of England. People who agreed with this started different religions. They were called Separatists. In England, Separatists were put into jail.
Brewster worked for a time for William Davison in the Netherlands. Davison went to jail because he was a Separatist. When Davison went to jail, Brewster went back home to Scrooby for a time. He became a postmaster. Brewster began a Separatist church in his house. In 1607, He also went to jail for a short time for doing this in. Brewster and other members of the Church decided to move to Netherlands in 1608. They hoped that would be able to practice their religion there. To leave England without permission was illegal, so they left in secret. In 1609, he was chosen as the leader of the congregation.
In Leiden, Brewster taught English. In 1616 he was a printer and made religious books for sale in England. In 1619, Brewster and Edward Winslow published a religious booklet which disagreed with King James I and the Church of England. The King ordered Brewster's arrest. He was forced to hide. The printing press was taken by the English ambassador and Brewster's partner was arrested. The congregation had already decided to leave Leiden for the New World. While Brewster was in hiding, the other members of the church looked to others such as John Carver and Robert Cushman to make the plans. Brewster escaped and, with the help of Cushman, he and Cushman were able to get aboard the "Mayflower" with their friends. His wife and two of his sons, Love and Wrestling, were also passengers.
The Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. 
Brewster became the senior religious leader at Plymouth Colony. He also served as an advisor to Governor William Bradford.
The Brewster and his wife Mary had six children: Jonathan, Patience, Fear, who married Isaac Allerton, Unnamed child, Love Brewster, and Wrestling Brewster
Brewster's son Jonathan, arrived the next year on the ship "Fortune". Brewster's daughters Patience and Fear arrived aboard the "Anne".
Brewster was given land on the islands of Boston Harbor. Four of those islands are named after him. In 1632, Brewster also received lands in nearby Duxbury and moved there from Plymouth Colony to build a farm. 
An epidemic killed many English and Indians in the region. William Brewster lost two daughters, Fear and Patience in 1634.
William Brewster died and was buried on 10 April 1644 at Burial Hill, Plymouth, Massachusetts. There is a memorial for him which says it is in honor of "Elder William Brewster Patriarch (father) of the Pilgrims and their Ruling Elder 1609–1644". The burial place of his wife Mary is unknown.

<doc id="400954" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=400954" title="Civil rights movement">
Civil rights movement

The civil rights movement was a series of worldwide political movements for equal civil and political rights. Many times in history, people have used nonviolence to show that they are equal without hurting anybody. Other times were more violent with people who began to rebel against others. Many of these movements did not fully achieve their goals. However, many of them helped make steps toward equality.
The main goal of the civil rights movement is that all people's rights are equally protected by the law, including the rights of minorities. Civil rights movements are different from each country. The LGBT rights movement, Women's rights movement, and many racial minority rights movements are still continuing to fight for equal rights.
The Angolan War of Independence was fought from 1961 to 1975. Angola fought against Portugal. Portugal was making people in Angola farm cotton. Three different groups in Angola were against Portugal. Millions of people died during the war.
Before 1974, the Portuguese Empire also controlled Portuguese Guinea. From 1963-1974, in the Guinea-Bissau War of Independence, the people in Guina fought for their independence. In 1974 they won, and formed the independent country of Guinea-Bissau.
The Mozambican War of Independence was fought from 1964 until 1975. It was fought between Portugal, which controlled Mozambique; and the Mozambique Liberation Front or Frelimo (). The Portuguese won the conflict, using guerilla soldiers. However, because of a coup d'état in Portugal, Mozambique became independent on June 25, 1975.
In Northern Ireland, the Campaign for Social Justice was formed in Belfast in 1964. Next the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) was formed. These groups wanted to:
These demands for reform caused a backlash by some in the unionist majority. This caused The Troubles to start. The Troubles were a civil war that lasted for more than 30 years.
The NICRA used the same methods used by the American Civil Rights Movement: nonviolent marches, pickets, sit-ins, and protests. The first civil rights march in Northern Ireland was held on 24 August 1968 between Coalisland and Dungannon.
Segregation was an attempt by white Southerners to separate the races. They did this to strengthen white pride and to be more powerful over African Americans. Segregation was often called the Jim Crow system.
Segregation became common in Southern states after the end of Reconstruction in 1877. Reconstruction followed the Civil War (1861-1865). During Reconstruction, Republican governments in the Southern states were run by blacks. The Reconstruction governments had passed laws opening up economic and political opportunities for blacks. However, by 1877, the Democratic Party had gained control of government in the Southern states. These Southern Democrats wanted to reverse black advances made during Reconstruction. To that end, they began to pass local and state laws that said certain places were "For Whites Only" and others for "Colored". Blacks had separate schools, transportation, restaurants, hospitals, and parks. Usually, they were not as good as the white-only places. Over the next 75 years, Jim Crow signs went up to separate the races in every possible place.
The system of segregation also included not letting African-Americans vote (this is called disfranchisement). Between 1890 and 1910, all Southern states passed laws that made it difficult or impossible for blacks to vote. For example, some laws said a person had to be able to read and write in order to vote. Many blacks had no access to education and property ownership. Because blacks could not vote, they were powerless to prevent whites from segregating all aspects of Southern life. They could do little to stop discrimination in public places, education, economic opportunities, or housing.
Conditions for blacks in Northern states were somewhat better. Blacks were usually free to vote in the North, but there were so few blacks that their voices were barely heard. Segregated facilities were not as common in the North. Blacks were usually denied entrance to the best hotels and restaurants. Schools in New England were usually integrated (with black and white students together). However, those in the Midwest generally were not.
On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a member of the Montgomery, Alabama, branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), was told to give up her seat on a city bus to a white person. When Parks refused to move, she was arrested. The local NAACP, led by Edgar D. Nixon, recognized that Parks' arrest might rally local blacks to protest segregated buses. Montgomery's black community had long been angry about their mistreatment on city buses, where white drivers were often rude and abusive. The community had previously considered a boycott of the buses. The Montgomery Bus Boycott was a success, with support from the 50,000 blacks in Montgomery. It lasted for more than a year. This event showed the American public that blacks in the South would not stop protesting until the end of segregation. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956. The boycott ended with the blacks winning the right to sit wherever they wanted.
A young Baptist pastor named Martin Luther King, Jr., was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. King became the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) when it was founded in 1957. SCLC wanted to celebrate the NAACP legal strategy by encouraging the use of nonviolence. These activities included marches, demonstrations, and boycotts. The violent white response to black direct action eventually forced the federal government to confront the issues of injustice and racism in the South.
In addition to his large following among blacks, King had a powerful appeal to liberal Northerners that helped him influence national public opinion. His advocacy of nonviolence attracted supporters among peace activists. He formed alliances in the American Jewish community. He also developed supporters from the ministers of wealthy, influential Protestant congregations in Northern cities. King often preached to those congregations, where he raised funds for SCLC.
The Chicano Movement is a political, social, and cultural movement by Mexican Americans. The Chicano Movement addresses negative ethnic stereotypes of Mexican people in the media and by Americans. People such as Tiburcio Vasquez and Joaquin Murietta became folk heros to Mexican Americans. They refused to obey White Americans.
The American Indian Movement (AIM) is a Native American activist organization in the United States. It was founded in 1968 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The organization was formed to stop issues concerning the Native American urban community in Minneapolis. They wanted to stop poverty, housing, treaty issues, and police harassment.
The first feminism equality issues was suffrage rights. This led women to get the right to vote. The second feminist issue involved economic equality (for example, getting paid the same as men if they did exactly the same kind of work).
Lesbians are also part of women's rights. The lesbian feminist groups, such as the Lavender Menace, are a lesbian activism group.
The events of the Hawaii Supreme Court promoted the United States Congress to create the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. This act forbids the federal government from accepting same-sex relationships to get married. Currently 30 states have passed state constitutional amendments that ban same-sex marriage. However, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont made gay marriage legal.
Before 1993, lesbian and gay people were not allowed to serve in the United States military. Under the "Don't ask, don't tell" (DADT) policy, they were only allowed to serve in the military if they did not tell anyone of their sexual orientation. The Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 allowed homosexual men and women to serve openly in the armed forces. Since September 20, 2011, gays, lesbians, and bisexuals have been able to serve openly. However, transsexual service-members still cannot serve openly, due to Department of Defense medical policies which consider gender identity disorder to be a medically disqualifying condition.
People who oppose gay rights in the United States have been political and religious conservatives. These people cite a number of Bible passages from the Old and New Testaments as their reason. The most opposition of gay rights are in the South and other states with a large rural population. Many organizations have opposed the gay rights movement. These include the American Family Association,
the Christian Coalition, Family Research Council, Focus on the Family, Save Our Children, NARTH, the national Republican Party, the Roman Catholic Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church),
the Southern Baptist Convention, Alliance for Marriage, Alliance Defense Fund, Liberty Counsel, and the National Organization for Marriage. A number of these groups have been named as anti-gay hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
The Civil Rights Movement in Germany was a left-wing backlash against the post-Nazi Party era of the country. The movement took place mostly among disillusioned students and was largely a protest movement to others around the globe during the late 1960s.
A general strike broke out across France in May 1968. It became a revolutionary problem. It was discouraged by the French Communist Party. It was finally suppressed by the government, which accused the communists of plotting against the Republic. Some philosophers and historians have argued that the rebellion was the single most important revolutionary event of the 20th century because it wasn't participated in by a lone demographic, such as workers or racial monorities, but was rather a purely popular uprising, superseding ethnic, cultural, age and class boundaries.

In Norse mythology, Hjúki and Bil are a brother and sister who follow Máni (the moon personified) across the sky. They are described in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Theories claim that the two gods' roles in mythology are the moon's phases. It is said that the two children were carrying a pail of water from a sacred well and that Máni swooped down and took the pail. The two children chase after Máni to attempt to take back their pail.

NML Cygni or V1489 Cygni is a red hypergiant star, and one of the largest stars known at present. It is about 1,650 times the Sun's radius. It is one of the extreme luminous supergiant stars. 
Its distance from Earth is estimated to be about 5,300 light-years. This star has a dusty environment surrounding it, and it has a bean-shaped asymmetric nebula with HO vapour. It is a semiregular variable star with a period of about 940 days.
NML Cygni is a part of the Cygnus OB2 association, which is 1.74 ± 0.2 kpc away. It is one of the closest massive associations to the Sun. 
It was discovered in 1965, by Neugebauer, Martz and Leighton. The name NML comes from the names of these three discoverers. It has also been given the designation V1489 on account of the small semi-regular brightness variations caused by pulsations and mass loss.
From the observations, this star has two dense envelopes of dust and molecules. The star has one of the largest mass loss rates at around 2 × 10 M per year. These dust envelopes are formed by the high mass emission rate. Because of its unique position in the Milky Way, the star does not dominate its local interstellar environment.
NML Cyg is a massive oxygen-rich star. Molecules like HO, SiO, CO, HCN, CS, SO, SO and HS are also present.

Off-by-one error

An Off-by-one errror is a logic error that often occurs in Computer programming and that often involve the checking of boundary conditions.
A fencepost error (occasionally called a telegraph pole or lamp-post error) is a specific type of off-by-one error. The following problem illustrates the error:
The intuitive answer 10 is wrong. The fence has 10 sections, but 11 posts.
The reverse error occurs when the number of posts is known and the number of sections is assumed to be the same. The actual number of sections is one less than the number of posts. 
More generally, the problem can be stated as follows:
The correct answer may be "n" − 1, "n", or "n" + 1, depending on the conditions. The precise problem definition must be carefully considered, as the setup for one situation may give the wrong answer for other situations. Fencepost errors come from counting things rather than the spaces between them, or vice versa, or by neglecting to consider whether one should count one or both ends of a row.
Off by one errors often occur with loops. If there are a number of fields, eg. in an array, and there is a loop over the array, an off-by-one error means that either there is one iteration too few to cover all elements, or one too many. In the first case, one element of the array is left out, in the second the index of the array will be outside its dimensions. The second error usually leads to an runtime error, because the program checks the size of the data structure, and sees that there are too few elements for the iteration. The first error is more problematic, because it usually is not detected. All that may point to the error is that one element is not initialized or does not have the expected value.

Logic error

In Computer programming a logic error is a bug in a program, which causes it to work incorrectly. A logic error produces unintended behaviour or output. In many cases, the syntax of the program is corrrect. This means that the environment used to make the program will not show an error. This makes logic errors difficult to find. 
This example function in C to calculate the average of two numbers contains a logic error. It is missing brackets in the calculation, so it compiles and runs but does not give the right answer.

Cato the Younger

Cato the Younger (Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis, 95 BC, Rome – April 46 BC, Utica) was a politician and statesman in the late Roman Republic, and a follower of the Stoic philosophy. He was known as "Cato Minor" to distinguish him from his great-grandfather (Cato the Elder). A noted orator, he had great moral integrity. He could not be bribed, and disliked the political corruption of the age. He is remembered for his stubbornness and for his lengthy conflict with Julius Caesar.
Plutarch tells a story about Cato's peers' immense respect for him, even at a young age. During a Roman ritual military game, called "Troy", in which all aristocratic teenagers participated as a sort of "coming of age" ceremony, a mock battle with wooden weapons was performed on horseback. While the child of one of Sulla's surrogates was chosen by the adult organizers to lead one of the "teams," the team refused to follow him because of his character, and when they were finally asked whom they would follow, the boys unanimously chose Cato.
As a military tribune, Cato was sent to Macedon in 67 BC at the age of 28. He was given command of a legion. He led his men from the front, sharing their work, food, and sleeping quarters. He was strict in discipline and punishment but was popular with his legionaries. When in Macedon, he got the news that his brother Caepio was dying in Thrace. He set off to see him but his brother died before he arrived. Cato was overwhelmed by grief and, for once, he spared no expense to organize lavish funeral ceremonies.
On his return to Rome in 65 BC, Cato was elected to the position of quaestor. One of his first moves was to prosecute former quaestors for misusing funds and dishonesty. Cato also prosecuted Sulla's informers, who had acted as head-hunters during Sulla's dictatorship. Cato did this even when the men were well connected politically. At the end of the year, Cato stepped down from his quaestorship amid popular acclaim, but he never ceased to keep an eye on the treasury, always looking for irregularities.
As senator, Cato was scrupulous and determined. He never missed a session of the Senate and publicly criticized those who did so. From the beginning, he aligned himself with the "Optimates", the conservative faction of the Senate. Many of the Optimates at this time had been Sulla's personal friends, whom Cato had despised since his youth, yet Cato attempted to make his name by returning his faction to its pure republican roots.
In 63 BC, he was elected tribune of the plebs for the following year. He helped the consul, Cicero, deal with the Catiline conspiracy. Lucius Sergius Catilina, a noble patrician, led a rebellion against the state, raising an army in Etruria. 
When Cicero discovered a plot against the consuls and other magistrates in Rome, he arrested the conspirators. Cicero proposed to execute them without trial (which was not lawful). In the Senate's discussion, Julius Caesar agreed the conspirators were guilty, but argued for distributing them among Italian cities "for safekeeping". In contrast, Cato argued that capital punishment was necessary to deter treason: it was folly to wait for the test of the conspirators' guilt. Convinced by Cato's argument, the Senate approved Cicero's proposal, and the conspirators were executed. Most of Catilina's army quit the field, much as Cato had predicted.
Cato was a supporter of Pompey, and continued the fight after Pompey was dead. The anti-Caesar forces, known as the Optimates (roughly, the "Good Guys") were reinforced by forces from local rulers. They numbered about eight legions (40.000 men) plus sixty elephants. Caesar defeated the Optimates at the Battle of Thapsus in modern Tunisia, North Africa. Cato did not actually take part in the battle, which was led by a colleague, and committed suicide after the defeat. Roughly 10,000 enemy soldiers wanted to surrender to Caesar, but were instead slaughtered by Caesar's army. This was unusual for Caesar, who was known as a merciful victor. No explanation of this is known.

Starburst galaxy

A starburst galaxy is a galaxy with a very high rate of star formation. The rate of star formation is so large that the galaxy will quickly use all of its gas reservoir (from which the stars are made). 
So, the starburst nature of a galaxy is a short phase in a galaxy's evolution. Most starburst galaxies are in the midst of a galaxy merger or at least close encounter with another galaxy. 
Studying nearby starburst galaxies can help us explore the history of galaxy formation and evolution. Many very distant galaxies seen, for example, in the Hubble Deep Field are known to be starbursts, but they are too far away to be studied in any detail. Looking at nearby examples give us an idea of what was happening in the early universe. The light we see from distant galaxies left them when the universe was much younger (see redshift). 
Starburst galaxies seem to be quite rare in our local universe, and are more common further away. This suggests there were more of them billions of years ago. All galaxies were closer together then, and therefore more likely to be influenced by each other's gravity. More frequent encounters produced more starbursts as galactic forms evolved with the expanding universe.
Well-known starburst galaxies include

Messier 82

Messier 82 (also known as NGC 3034, Cigar galaxy or M82) is the nearby starburst galaxy about 12 million light years away in the constellation Ursa Major. It is five times brighter than the whole Milky Way and one hundred times brighter than our galaxy's center.
In 2005, the Hubble Space Telescope revealed 197 young massive clusters in the starburst core. The average mass of these clusters is around 2 "M", hence the starburst core is a very energetic and high-density environment. Throughout the galaxy's center, young stars are being born 10 times faster than they are inside our entire Milky Way Galaxy.
M82 is being physically affected by its larger neighbor, nearby spiral M81. Tidal forces caused by gravity have deformed M82, a process that started about 100 million years ago. This interaction has caused star formation to increase tenfold compared to "normal" galaxies.
Recently, M82 has undergone at least one tidal encounter with M81. This resulted in a large amount of gas being funnelled into the galaxy's core over the last 200 million years (myr). The most recent such encounter is thought to have happened around 2–5 years ago and resulted in a concentrated starburst together with a marked peak in the cluster age distribution. This starburst ran for up to ~50 myr at a rate of ~10 "M" per year. Two subsequent starbursts followed, the last of which (~4–6 myr ago) may have formed the core star clusters.
In April 2010, radio astronomers at the Jodrell Bank Observatory of the University of Manchester reported an unknown object in M82. The object started sending out radio waves, and the emission did not look like anything seen anywhere in the universe before.
There have been several theories about the nature of this unknown object, but currently no theory entirely fits the observed data. The object is several arcseconds from the center of M82. It has an apparent motion of four times the speed of light relative to the galaxy centre.

The Baby boom galaxy is a starburst galaxy 12.2 billion light years away. 
It was discovered by NASA's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology. The galaxy is the new record holder for the brightest starburst galaxy in the very distant universe, its brightness being a measure of its extreme star-formation rate. 
The Baby boom galaxy has been called "the extreme stellar machine" because it is seen producing stars at a surprising rate of up to 4,000 per year. Our Milky Way galaxy turns out an average of just 10 stars per year.
At its rate, the galaxy needs only 50 million years to grow into an equivalent of the most massive galaxy ever observed. 
The discovery challenges the accepted model for galaxy formation. This has most galaxies slowly bulking up by absorbing pieces of other galaxies, rather than growing internally. Another unusual aspect is the fact that scientists are observing this galaxy at a time when the universe was only a little over 1.4 billion years old. Evidently, the galaxy was doing this when the universe was still in its infancy.
"This galaxy is undergoing a major baby boom, producing most of its stars all at once", said Peter Capak of NASA's Spitzer Science Center. To that, the principal investigator of the Cosmic Evolution Surveyor, Nick Scoville of Caltech responded:
"We may be witnessing, for the first time, the formation of one of the most massive elliptical galaxies in the universe".
The different colors in the figure of the Baby boom galaxy refers to different wavelengths. The red color refers to new born stars in the galaxy. Interfered lights are giving off as the warm dust is heated by the stars.

The Pontian Greek Genocide was a genocide by the Young Turks in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War. It is estimated that at least 1,100,000 Pontic Greeks were killed during the raids and massacres.
The name given to this is the "Genoktonia ton Ellinon tou Póntou" which is the Greek word for "Pontian Greek genocide". Many Pontian Greeks were considered unpure by the Turks and were massacred for not submitting their Christian identity. The Pontian Greeks lost their homes and possessions to the Sultan-Adulhamed the Red and even before the genocide—they were persecuted and forced to pay high taxes.
Since ancient times and conquest by the Empire of trebizond, the Pontian Greeks have not have had their own nation. It was called a diaspora and they have spread over to many different countries. Under the Kurds and Turks, they were oppressed and assimilated to society and many lost their independence. Those that survive continue to have a common unity especially in their deep Christian faith.
The Pontian Greek genocide took place in the same context and time-period as the Assyrian and Armenian genocides.

Kamoya Kimeu (born c. 1940), a Kamba tribesman, is one of the world's most successful fossil collectors. With paleontologists Meave Leakey and Richard Leakey, he found some of the most significant paleoanthropological discoveries. Kimeu found a "Homo habilis" skull known as KNM ER 1813, and an almost complete "Homo erectus" skeleton known as Turkana Boy or Nariokotome boy). He has two fossil primates named after him: "Kamoyapithecus hamiltoni" and "Cercopithecoides kimeui".
Kimeu began to work in paleoanthropology as a labourer for Louis Leakey and Mary Leakey in the 1950s. He was recruited for Mary Leakey's team when she took over as head of excavations at Olduvai. She preferred to hire Kamba men rather than Kikuyu, whom Louis preferred. In 1963 he joined with Richard Leakey's expeditions, accompanying him to the Omo River and Lake Rudolf (now Lake Turkana) in 1967. 
He quickly became Richard Leakey's right-hand man, controlling field operations in Leakey's absence. In 1977 he became the National Museums of Kenya's curator for all prehistoric sites in Kenya.

Turner was one the original group who moved to Leiden Holland in 1610 to escape religious persecution with William Bradford and William Brewster. Turner was a merchant and a (political official) of Leiden. 
Many of these people lived in Middelburg, Holland. This is located in Zeeland. Turner also delivered mail to the Separatists from their family and friends in England. Turner also brought cargoes of English pewter from London to Holland. He also carried letters between people in Leiden and London. On June 10, 1620, Turner carried information to the congregation on the progress of their planned trip to the New World.
According to William Bradford, John Turner traveled on the "Mayflower" with his two sons. 
Turner left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. John Turner signed the Mayflower Compact. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.
When they landed, Turner went out on the exploratory trips to look for permanent places to live. Turner was one of the "Mayflower" passengers would made first contact with the Indians.
Turner also had a daughter Elizabeth, who stayed in Leiden. She would have been one year old. Elizabeth Turner married and travelled to New England before October 1635. She joined the Salen Church.
Turner and his sons died sometime in the winter of 1620/21. Turner was buried in Cole's Hill Burial Ground in Plymouth, presumably in an unmarked grave as with most "Mayflower" passengers who died in that first winter. There names are all on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb on Coles Hill as “John Turner and two sons.”

Christopher Martin

Christopher Martin (15821621) and his family traveled on the "Mayflower" in 1620.
Martin, his wife Mary, son, Nathaniel and step-son, Solomon all came from Billericay in Essex England. Martin was a merchant by trade.
The family did not believe in the Church of England. In 1612, Martin and his wife would not take Holy Communion. Another time, Nathaniel and Solomon made the Church Vicar angry with during a service. Martin got into trouble because he would not give church officials the financial accounts he kept.
Martin and his family joined a Separatist church. They all wanted to go to the New World. Martin sold his property and bought passage on the ship.
The people asked Martin to help them by buying supplies. He did not spent the money wisely. He purchased things like beer, wine, salted beef and pork, dried peas, fishing supplies, muskets, armor, clothing, tools, and other things to trade with the Native Americans. One thing he purchased, the screw-jack, would be very useful to keep the "Mayflower" from sinking.
There were two ships going to Virginia Colony, the "Speedwell" and the "Mayflower". Martin was assigned to be the leader of the passengers on the "Speedwell" but the ship needed repairs. A fellow passenger and official of the trip, Robert Cushman said, that Martin will not listen to them, nor allow them to go ashore in case they should run away. Some of the passengers quit the voyage to return to London and lost much or all of their money. Others boarded the "Mayflower" which became very crowded.
Christopher Martin left on "Mayflower" in company with his wife Mary, his servant John Langmore and his stepson Solomon Prower. Nathaniel Martin stayed in England.
The Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" spotted land. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor. They landed on 21 November. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. Christopher Martin signed the Mayflower Compact. His step-son and his servant were too young to sign.
When the "Mayflower" was docked in the Harbor, Martin and other men went to land to find a place where they all could live.
In the winter of 1621 Martin, his wife, son and servant became ill and died.
Martin and his wife Mary were buried in the Cole's Hill Burial Ground, Plymouth.
There is a plaque in the United Reform Church in England to honor the "Mayflower" passengers. The plaque names Christopher Martin, Marie (Mary) Martin, Solomon Prower and John Langerman.

Cockburn Town

Cockburn Town is the capital city of the Turks and Caicos Islands.
Cockburn Town is in the Grand Turk Island, the largest island in the Turks Islands archipelago. Historic 18th and 19th century Bermudian architecture can be seen on Duke and Front Streets in the town. The town is known for its long, narrow streets and old street lamps.
The closest area where ships can come near the city is Hawk's Nest Anchorage, which, though protected from the wind, should only be entered in good light because of reefs near the entrance.
The seat of government ever since 1766, Cockburn Town was the first permanent settlement on any of the islands, founded in 1681 by salt collectors who arrived in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The city supposedly lies on the place where Juan Ponce de León first landed on the island.
Cockburn Town is home to the Turks & Caicos National Museum, which is housed in the colonial-era Guinep House, on Front Street. The house is believed to be over 180 years old and is named after the large and old Guinep tree that is in front of the building. The site was donated to the Museum in 1990.
Some of the exhibits detail the history of the Lucayans (the original people of the islands), the Space Race, Turks and Caicos postage stamps, slavery and the history of the slave trade, the sisal and salt industries, royal events, as well as a general history of the islands. The museum also maintains a garden, which is adjacent to the Guinep House. 
Also of interest are the museum's research projects, including its "Message in a Bottle" Project, recording nearly 40 years' worth of messages found in bottles on the beaches of Grand Turk.

Ibarra was born on March 19, 1893 in Quito, Ecuador. He studied at Central University of Ecuador. Ibarra was married to Corina Parral de Velasco Ibarra until his death in 1979.
In 1933, he stood in the Ecuadorian presidential election and received 80% of the votes cast, the highest in Ecuadorian history. Velasco Ibarra traveled through several Latin American countries, including Peru, and restored Ecuador's global image. His first presidency began on September 1, 1934, but he was ousted in August 1935 by the military.
In May 1944, because of the May 28 "Glorious Revolution", he was named Supreme Chief of the Republic and was later named Constitutional President by the Constituent Assembly. In August 1947, he was again deposed by the military. Three defense ministers perpetuated the coup against Velasco Ibarra; among them was minister Mancheno, who later was his successor.
In 1952, he again won the presidential election, and began his third term as president on September 1, 1952. This time, he served his entire term, which ended on August 31, 1956. His third term was a time of progress for Ecuador: 311 schools were constructed, with another 104 in progress. More than 1359 km of roads were constructed, and 1057 km more were improved.
In 1960, he was elected president for the fourth time and was removed on November 7, 1961. In 1960, he nullified the Rio de Janeiro Protocol, which led to conflicts between Ecuador and Peru, including Paquisha in 1981 and the War of El Cenepa in 1995.

Edward Winslow

Edward Winslow (1595 – May 8, 1655) traveled on the "Mayflower" in 1620 so he could practice his own religion which was not allowed in England. Winslow helped to organize the voyage to the New World and was a leader at Plymouth Colony. He signed the Mayflower Compact 
Edward Winslow was born in Droitwich, Worcestershire England. His parents were Edward and Magdalene Winslow. In 1613 Winslow was apprenticed to a London printer. Winslow became a Separatist which was a religion that did not believe in the Church of England.
It was illegal to be a Separatist in England, so in 1617 Edward Winslow moved to Leiden, Netherlands where he worked with William Brewster. They started to print religious booklets which were critical of the English king and his bishops. The English King ordered Brewster’s arrest, and he was forced to hide.
The Separatists were planning to move to America and they need leaders to plan the voyage. Thomas Weston helped them by providing the ship "Mayflower" for their journey. Winslow's brother Gilbert and family servant George Soule and a youth, Elias Story went with him. Elinor (Ellen) More, a girl of eight years, also went with them Elinor died in the winter of 1620 with only one brother Richard More surviving.
Edward Winslow left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" spotted land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. Winslow signed the Mayflower Compact. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.
The men went to land to explore a place where they all could live. One of the missions included William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edwary Doty. Bradford wrote that they set off in freezing weather and many of the men were ill. He said that "when the set sail the salt spray froze on their coats, as
if they had been glazed". Of this group Hopkins was the most experienced, having seen Native Americans during his time at Jamestown. During their trip they saw Native Americans who were cutting up a large whale. When the Indians saw the men they ran away. 
Plymouth Colony lost over half of its population because of sickness, lack of proper food and the cold winter. With the help of friendly Native Americans, they learned to grow food. In 1621, Winslow and the others attended what would have the first Thanksgiving.
The next year they were able to load the ship "Fortune" with furs and other supplies. This was to pay the men would helped pay for the trip to the New World. On the return trip, the "Mayflower" was attacked by the French and all the cargo was taken.
On February 21, 1621, William White died leaving a widow, Susanna, and two sons, Resolved and Peregrine. Edward Winslow had lost his wife Elizabeth on March 24, 1621. In 1621, Edward Winslow and Susanna White became the first couple to marry in Plymouth Colony. They had 5 children: A (child) who died young, Edward Winslow, Josiah Winslow and Elizabeth. Josiah became the 13th Governor of Plymouth Colony.
Winslow had a friendship with native leader Massasoit. These Native Americans were friendly and helped the Pilgrims. In January 1629 a fishing and trading post opened up on the Kennebec River near Plymouth Colony. Isaac Allerton also opened his own trading post there and this caused problems between the two men.
In 1632, Winslow explored the Connecticut River. 
Winslow was a diplomat and a spokesperson for the Pilgrims with English officials. Winslow was a governor in 1634, 1636 and 1644 and was a member of the United Colonies of New England. This was a military group which protected the pilgrims against unfriendly Native Americans.
England had a civil war in the 1640s. Some pilgrims returned to fight against the King. In 1646, Winslow began working for Oliver Cromwell. Winslow never returned to Plymouth Colony.
In 1654, Winslow fought against the Spanish in the West Indies. They won the battle but Winslow became ill and died from yellow fever. He was buried at sea. Winslow Cemetery in Marshfield, Massachusetts has a stone monument which lists the names of the Winslow family. There is another memorial stone w/plaque stating "Edward Winslow, Founder of Marshfield". Edward Winslow's first wife Elizabeth Barker Winslow was buried in 1621 in the Cole's Hill Burial Ground, Plymouth, Massachusetts.

Saturnalia (dinosaur)

Saturnalia is an extinct genus of basal prosauropod dinosaur from the Triassic of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. The deposits are dated to the early Upper Triassic, about 225 million years ago (mya). The dinsaur grew to about 1.5 meters (5 ft) long.
The primitive nature of "Saturnalia", and its mixture of sauropodomorph and theropod characteristics, has made it difficult to classify. 
The first (1999) description of the genus assigned it to the Sauropodomorpha. However, in a 2003 paper, Langer noted that features of its skull and hand were more similar to the sister group of sauropodomorphs, the theropods, and that "Saturnalia" could be considered a member of the sauropodomorph "stem-lineage", rather than a true member of that group. 
José Bonaparte and colleagues, in a 2007 study, found "Saturnalia" to be very similar to the primitive saurischian "Guaibasaurus". Bonaparte placed the two in the same family, Guaibasauridae. Like Langer, Bonaparte found that these forms may have been primitive sauropodomorphs, or an assemblage of forms close to the common ancestor of the sauropodomorphs and theropods. Overall, Bonaparte found that both "Saturnalia" and "Guaibasaurus" were more theropod-like than prosauropod-like. However, all more recent cladistic analyses found it to be a very basal sauropodomorph,

Massasoit

Massasoit (c. 15811661),
was the Native American leader of the Wampanoag and "Massasoit" tribes. His name means "Great Leader".
Massasoit was born in a Pokanoket village at the site of today's Rhode Island. His village was near a spring of water which is named after him. He was liked by seven leaders. In March 1621, a Native American named Samoset entered Plymouth Colony and said to the Pilgrims in English, "Welcome Englishmen". He had learned some words from the English fishermen and traders that had visited his tribe. He said he was sent by Massasoit, “the greatest leader of the country.” After a few days, Massasoit came in person and was received with great friendship. 
Massasoit made a treaty with the Pilgrims. They promised to protect each other against unfriendly Native Americans. They promised not to hurt each other. They also promised to help each other as friends. Massasoit told the pilgrims that there was much sickness where the colonist were now living and that many had died. The treaty was kept as long as Massasoit lived.
Massasoit helped the people of Plymouth Colony in many ways, including how to plant corn. He became friends with the all of the colonial leaders.
During this time, Massasoit had five children. His oldest son, "Moanam" or Wamsutta, died within a year after his father, and his brother Metacom (Philip) became chief in 1662.
There was some bad feeling for a time when the Plymouth leaders refused to give up Squanto to Massasoit. He believe that Squanto had betrayed him. This was settled when Edward Winslow visited him in March 1623. Massasoit was ill and Winslow took care of him. After he got better, Massasoit said the English are my friends and love me. He also said that while he lives he would never forget the kindness they have showed me."
The Wampanoag and the English maintained a friendship until Massasoit's death. During this time, Massasoit sold lands to the English that they needed. When Roger Williams, was sent away from the Massachusetts colony, he spent many weeks with Massasoit. Massasoit was friendly and honest and always kept his word. He warned the pilgrims of any Native Americans who were not their friends.
Massasoit died as early as 1660. When he died, his son Wamsutta became chief. When Wamsutta died Metacom (Philip) took his place. Of Massasoit's five children, the only child to survive King Philip's War in 1676 was his daughter, Amie, wife of Tispaquin.
Massasoit was a character in "The Mayflower Voyagers", a 1988 episode of the Peanuts television series, "This is America, Charlie Brown". 
At the beginning of the 1995 movie adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's "The Scarlet Letter", Massasoit dies and his tribe cremates him.

Cash Cab

Cash Cab is an American television game show. It airs on the Discovery Channel. It started on December 5, 2005, and ended 2012. It is hosted by Ben Bailey. It takes place in New York City.
Potential contestants enter a taxi driven by Bailey. When they get in and say where they want to go, they are made aware that they are in the Cash Cab through ceiling lights and music, followed by Bailey's greeting. They are then asked if they want to play. If they do not want to play, they can get out of the taxi. If they do want to play, they have to stay in the taxi until they reach where they want to go or get three strikes.
Contestants who play are asked a series of questions by Bailey. The first four questions are worth $50, the next four are worth $100, and questions after that are worth $200. In the first two seasons, the questions were worth $25, $50, and $100. If a contestant answers a question wrong, they get a strike. If the contestant gets three strikes, they have to get out of the taxi no matter where they are. Contestants have two helps known as "Shout-Outs." The first Shout-Out is the Mobile Shout-Out, which lets the contestant call someone they know for help. The call can take up to 15 seconds. The other Shout-Out is the Street Shout-Out, where Bailey pulls over the taxi, and the contestant can ask someone on the street for help.
When the taxi has to stop at a red light and the contestant has at least $200, a "Red Light Challenge" is played. A question will be given that has more than one correct answer. The contestant has 30 seconds to give all of the correct answers to the question. If the contestant does so, they get $250. If the 30 second time limit runs out, the contestant doesn't get a strike. Most games have only one Red Light Challenge, but starting in the fourth season, some games have more than one. The second is played if the contestant has at least $1,000.
If the contestant gets to where they wanted to go without getting three strikes, they have a choice: they can leave the taxi and keep the money they won, or risk it on a Video Bonus question. If they decide to play the Video Bonus question, a clip is played, and a question is asked based on it. If the contestant answers correctly, their money is doubled.

Eyespot

An eyespot is a simple light-sensitive organ in biology. It may be called an ocellus, or pigment pit. They are quite common in small, simple invertebrates, such as "Planaria". They do not have lenses or any means of focussing. Therefore, they can sense light from dark, but do not give the animal a visual scene as our eyes do.
In many simple animals the eyespot senses light with a pigment molecule called an opsin. Then a nerve fibre goes from the eyespot to the simple nervous system. This allows the animal to move in response to (for example) a shadow passing over it.
Eyespots also occur in single-celled protists like "Euglena" and "Chlamydomonas", where it is connected to the flagellum. This allows the information from the light patch to influence the cells's movement.
The first fossils of eyes that have been found to date are from the early Cambrian period (about 540 million years ago). This period saw a burst of apparently rapid evolution, called the "Cambrian explosion". One idea is that the evolution of eyes started an arms race which led to a rapid spate of evolution. Much earlier than this organisms would have used light spots for light sensitivity, but did not have a visual scene for rapid navigation.

Managed motorway

Managed motorways in the United Kingdom are motorways which use active traffic management. Their aim is to increase traffic capacity at times of peak traffic flow. They use variable speed limits and hard shoulder running at busy times. A "hard shoulder" is an inner lane which in normal times is only used for emergencies.
Active traffic management was first used in 2005. The system is now in operation on sections of the M1, M4, M6, and M42, and there are proposals for its use on sections of the M5, M25, M60 and M62. 
Benefits include smoother traffic flows, more reliable journey times, fewer road traffic collisions, and reduced noise and harmful vehicle emissions. Where only variable speed limits are used, it is called a controlled motorway.

Kiddush

Kiddush () is a blessing said by Jews at the start of Shabbat and holiday meals. The term is also used to refer to a light meal served in the synagogue after the long Shabbat and holiday morning prayers. The word comes from a Hebrew root meaning "holy".
There are two versions of the Ten Commandments in the Bible. These versions use different words. The version in Exodus says "Remember Shabbat to keep it holy." The version in Deuteronomy says "Guard Shabbat to keep it holy." Jewish custom says that "remember" means to "celebrate" Shabbat. "Guard" means "resting"—not working or doing business.
There are many things Jews do to celebrate Shabbat [see Shabbat (Celebrating Shabbat)]. The minimum way to celebrate is to say the blessing "Blessed are You, God, Who makes Shabbat holy." The Talmud adds that the blessing should be said with a cup of wine. This is because wine makes people feel happy. Because of this, the Friday evening meal in a Jewish home starts with a ceremony to say this blessing over a cup of wine.
In traditional homes, the blessing is said in the Hebrew language. This is a Simple English translation of the blessing. Words in italics "like this" are added to explain the Hebrew.
There is a different version of Kiddush for the Shabbat morning (or noon) meal. This ceremony makes the meal feel more special. 
For the morning Kiddush, a person says verses from the Torah about Shabbat. These verses are usually from and . The person ends with the same blessing over the wine:
Most Jews do not say Kiddush at the third Shabbat meal. However, Maimonides ruled that they should do so. The text for this Kiddush includes . That verse is the source of the law to have three meals on Shabbat.
Kiddush is also said in the synagogue. This does not replace saying Kiddush at home before the meal.
Kiddush is said on these Jewish holidays: 
The holiday texts are different from the Shabbat texts. The blessings are said in the same way and at the same time of day as on Shabbat, but there are two differences:
Jews usually use a fancy cup for Kiddush. The most common material for this cup is silver. Other materials are also used. These include ceramic, glass and wood. The most important part of the custom is for the cup to be special and unusual in honor of the blessing.

Marco was born in Los Angeles. He took lessons in drama, singing, and dancing at an early age. After graduating from Hollywood High School, he served in the United States Navy during World War II. 
His first known movie role was a small part in the 1944 movie "Sweet and Low-Down" with Benny Goodman. In the early 1950s, The Amazing Criswell predicted on national television that Paul Marco would go far in the movie business. Criswell introduced Marco to Ed Wood. In turn, Marco introduced Ed Wood to Bunny Breckinridge, a gay Shakespearean actor. Breckinridge lived with Marco for a time and co-starred in Wood's "Plan 9 from Outer Space".
Marco depended on Wood for parts. He more or less retired as an actor as Ed Wood's movies shifted more and more towards pornography. In 1995, Marco recorded "Home on the Strange", in which he reprised his Kelton character for Dionysus Records. He revived Kelton once more in the 2005 science fiction satire/tribute film "The Naked Monster". On May 14, 2006, Paul Marco died after a battle with hip problems and chronic illness. He was 78.

Cellular automaton

A cellular automaton is a model used in computer science and mathematics. The idea is to model a dynamic system by using a number of cells. Each cell has one of several possible states. With each "turn" or iteration the state of the current cell is determined by two things: its current state, and the states of the neighbouring cells. 
A very famous example of a cellular automata is Conway's Game of Life. Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann first described cellular automata in the 1940s. Conway's Game of Life was first shown in the 1970s. 
Some biological processes occur—or can be simulated—by cellular automata.
The patterns of certain seashells are generated by natural cellular automata. Examples can be seen in the genera "Conus" and "Cymbiola". The pigment cells are in a narrow band along the shell's lip. Each cell secretes pigments according to the activating and inhibiting activity of its neighbor pigment cells, obeying a natural version of a mathematical rule. The cell band leaves the colored pattern on the shell as it grows slowly. For example, the widespread species "Conus textile" bears a pattern resembling Wolfram's rule 30 cellular automaton.
Plants regulate their intake and loss of gases via a cellular automaton mechanism. Each stoma on the leaf acts as a cell.
Moving wave patterns on the skin of cephalopods can be simulated with a two-state, two-dimensional cellular automata, each state corresponding to either an expanded or retracted chromatophore.
Threshold automata have been invented to simulate neurons, and complex behaviors such as recognition and learning can be simulated.
Fibroblasts are similar to cellular automata, as each fibroblast only interacts with its neighbors.

"Coriaria ruscifolia" was described for the first time by Linnaeus in 1753 in "Species Plantarum" (Vol. 2, page 1037), from a plant from Peru.
The species is divided in two subspecies:
Shrub up to 4 metres high. Dark green leaves on the top and pale gray on the underside. Flowers grouped in terminal inflorescences on lateral branches, sepals are green to red, small petals, yellow or red anthers. Fruits look like berries but they are small nuts (achenes). The fruits are covered by the petals.
The number of chromosomes is 40.
The plants of "C. ruscifolia" subsp. "microphylla" can fix nitrogen from the air because they have bacteria in their roots.
C. ruscifolia grows in the Americas and some Pacific Islands:
It is a very toxic plant. Fruits are hallucinogens exciting the nervous system. The leaves have tannin and serve for tanning (making leather out of skins). It is recommended as an ornamental.
In Chile, the fruits are used mixed with bread to kill mice and rats.

The Little Mermaid (statue)

The Little Mermaid is a statue in Copenhagen, Denmark. It sits on a rock in the harbor. It was inspired by a performance of a ballet based on the fairy tale "The Little Mermaid" by Hans Christian Andersen. It is tall. Sculptor Edvard Eriksen created the bronze statue. It was presented to the public on 23 August 1913.
The statue was the idea of Carl Jacobsen, son of the founder of Carlsberg. He asked ballerina, Ellen Price of Copenhagen's Royal Theatre, to pose for the statue. Only the statue's head was modelled on Price. She did not agree to pose in the nude, so the sculptor's wife, Eline Eriksen, posed for the body.
The Little Mermaid has been the victim of vandalism many times since the 1960s. Her head has been cut off, and she has had paint poured over her several times. In September 2003, the statue was knocked off its base with explosives. The statue has always been repaired after such acts.

Hangman

Hangman is a paper-and-pencil guessing game played by two or more people. One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence, and the other players have to try and guess it. They do so by calling letters or numbers that they think are in the word. The word is shown as a row of dashes. If a guessing player gives a letter or number that is in the word, the other player writes the letter or number in the places that they are in the word. If the letter or number is not in the word, the other player draws a part of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark (a form of numeral used for counting). The game ends when:
The television game show "Wheel of Fortune" is based off of Hangman. It uses a roulette-style wheel that players spin for cash and prizes.

Edward Oakley Thorp (born 14 August 1932) is an American mathematics professor, author, hedge fund manager, and blackjack player. He is best known as the author of "Beat the Dealer" (1962). This was the first book to prove that the house advantage in blackjack could be overcome by card counting. As part of this work he collaborated with Claude Shannon in creating the first wearable computer in 1961. 
Thorp also developed and applied effective hedge fund techniques in the financial markets. He was a pioneer in modern applications of probability theory, including the harnessing of very small correlations for reliable financial gain.
Thorp received his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1958, and worked at M.I.T. from 1959 to 1961. He was a professor of mathematics from 19611965 at New Mexico State University, and then joined the University of California, Irvine where he was a professor of mathematics from 1965 to 1977 and a professor of mathematics and finance from 1977 to 1982.
Since the late 1960s, Thorp has used his knowledge of probability and statistics in the stock market by discovering and exploiting a number of pricing in the securities markets. Thorp is currently the President of Edward O. Thorp & Associates, based in Newport Beach, CA. In May 1998, Thorp reported that his personal investments yielded an annualized 20 percent rate of return averaged over 28.5 years.

Hydrogenosome

A hydrogenosome is a membrane-enclosed organelle of some anaerobic ciliates, trichomonads, fungi and a few metazoa. The hydrogenosomes of trichomonads (the best studied) produce ATP by a complex metabolic cycle. Unlike mitochondria, this cycle does not use oxygen. It is thought that hydrogenosomes evolved from mitochondria; their structure is rather similar.
In 2010, scientists reported their discovery of the first known anaerobic metazoans with hydrogenosome-like organelles. These organisms were Loricifera living in sediments under deep-water brine pools like the L'Atalante basin. These brine pools are completely without any oxygen (anoxic).

A cytokine storm is an overreaction of the body's immune system. It can be deadly. It consists of a positive feedback loop between cytokines and immune cells.
It is believed that cytokine storms were responsible for many of the deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed a disproportionate number of young adults. In this case, a healthy immune system may have been a liability rather than an asset. Preliminary research results from Hong Kong also suggest this as the probable reason for many deaths during the SARS epidemic in 2003. Human deaths from the bird flu H5N1 usually involve cytokine storms as well.

Black Hole of Calcutta was a dungeon in old Fort William, Calcutta, India. It was 18 feet (5.5 metres) long and 14 feet (4 metres) wide, and had two small windows. 
The fort was built by the British to defend their trading interests in Calcutta. During hostilities in 1756, the fort was captured by the army of the Nawab of Bengal on 20 June. John Zephaniah Holwell, a British eyewitness, reported that those taken in the capture of the fort, numbering 146, were confined to the dungeon, and that only 23 survived. The story was told by survivor John Zephaniah Holwell, a survivor. However, 146 people could not have fit in a room of 24 x 18 feet. Today most concede that Holwell greatly exaggerated the number of captives.
The British captured and killed the Nawab. An obelisk was later raised in memory of those who died in the Black Hole. Holwell's account of the incident has been challenged by modern historians and scholars.

<doc id="401698" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=401698" title="Vellum">
Vellum

Vellum is a high-quality form of parchment. Originally, it meant calf skin, but in English the term is used more widely.
Like parchment, the skin is prepared to take writing in ink. It was one of the standard writing surfaces used in Europe before paper became available. It continued to be used for high-status documents. The vellum was used for single pages, scrolls, codices or books.
To manufacture vellum, the skin is cleaned, then bleached, stretched on a frame called a "herse", and scraped with a knife. When vellum is scraped, it is by turns wet and dry to create tension. A final finish is got by rubbing the surface with pumice, and treating it with lime or chalk. Then it is ready to accept ink.
Modern "paper vellum" (sometimes called vegetable vellum) is made out of synthetic material instead of mammal skin, but is used for the same purpose as normal vellum.
In ancient Europe, vellum meant good quality prepared animal skin. calves, sheep, goat and even camel are known to have been used to make vellum. The very best vellum was made from unborn animals. It can be hard to identify the animal used to make old vellum without using a science lab.
French sources defined velum (or velin in French) as made from calves only. This has remained true in modern times.
Most of the best sort of medieval manuscripts were written on vellum. Some Buddhist texts were written on vellum, and all Sifrei Torah texts are written on vellum or alternatives.
A quarter of the 180 copy edition of Johannes Gutenberg's first Bible printed in 1455 was also printed on vellum, presumably because his costumers expected this for a high-quality book. Paper was used for most book-printing, at the time.
In art, vellum was used for paintings, especially if they needed to be sent long distances, before canvas became widely used in about 1500, and continued to be used for drawings, and watercolours. Old master prints were sometimes printed on vellum, especially for presentation copies, until at least the seventeenth century.
Limp vellum or limp-parchment bindings was used frequently in the 16th and 17th centuries, and were sometimes gilt. In later centuries vellum has been more commonly used like leather. Vellum can be stained virtually any color but mainly is not, as many people like its faint grain and hair markings, simply its simplicity.
Many documents that needed to last long were written in vellum as it was able to last longer than paper. Some vellum-written documents still survive today.
British Acts of Parliament are still printed on vellum for archival purposes, as are those of the Republic of Ireland. It is still used for Jewish scrolls, for luxury book covers, memorial books, and for various documents in calligraphy.
Today, because of low demand and complicated manufacturing process, animal vellum is expensive and hard to find. Only one UK company still supplies them. A modern vellum-like alternative is made out of cotton. Known as paper vellum, this material is cheaper than animal vellum and can be found in most art and crafting supply stores. Some brands of writing paper and other sorts of paper use the term "vellum" to suggest quality.
In the artistic crafts of writing, illuminating, lettering, and bookbinding, "vellum" is normally reserved for calfskin, while any other skin is called "parchment".
Paper vellum is made from cotton. Usually translucent, paper vellum in various sizes is often used in applications where tracing is required, such as architectural plans. Like natural vellum, the paper vellum is more stable than paper, which is frequently critical in the development of large drawings and plans such as blueprints.
Vellum is typically stored in a stable environment with a stable temperature. If vellum is stored in an environment with less than 11% relative humidity, it becomes fragile, brittle, and susceptible to mechanical stresses; if it is stored in an environment with greater than 40% relative humidity, it becomes vulnerable to mold or fungus growth. The best temperature for the preservation of vellum is 20 ± 1.5 °C (68 ± 3 °F)

Behold! the angels said: "O Mary! Allah hath chosen thee and purified thee- chosen thee above the women of all nations.
Mary is mentioned in the Quran frequently. Her life narrative occurs in the earliest chapters. The nineteenth chapter is named after her. The chapter is called "Maryam".
In the Quran, Mary is believed to have come from the house of Amram.
The birth of Mary is mentioned in the Quran in various chapters. Her father Joachim (; ) and her mother Anne (; ) are also mentioned in the Quran. The Quran tells that Joachim and Anne were old and had no children for years. One day Anne saw a bird feeding her young. Seeing this made Anne want a child for herself. She prayed to Allah for a child. She promised that if her prayers were answered, her child's life would dedicated to the service of Allah. Anne also prayed for her child to be protected from the "touch" of Satan (; ).
The Quran tells that Mary grew up in the temple of prayer and had a special place of her own in the temple. The Quran narrates that there was a cast of whom shall be the guardian of Mary. The outcome was the Prophet Zechariah. Often, Zechariah would visit the chamber of Mary, and he would find her with plenty of food. He always asked her where she got the food. Mary's answer was "Allah provides to whom he will". Zechariah would not question this because, being a Prophet, he would have known that Allah is the provider of all things and life.
The birth of Jesus and the Annunciation of Mary are very important to Islam. They are considered to be some of the most important miracles of Allah. The first mention of the Annunciation following the Birth of Jesus is in sura 19 (Maryam)ayah 20. The Quran tells that the Angel Gabriel (, al-Ruḥ al-Quds, Jibra'il) came to the Virgin Mary and told her that she would be pregnant with a holy child. The Virgin Mary asks how she will be pregnant when no man has touched her. The Angel Gabriel tells her that for Allah all things are easy and the Birth of Jesus will be a sign for mankind. The birth is mentioned later at sura 66 (At-Tahrim) ayah 12, where the Quran tells that the Virgin Mary remained pure while Allah created Jesus inside her womb.
The Quran narrates the virgin birth of Jesus many times. The Quran states that Jesus was born when Allah breathed on Mary while her body was chaste.
The Quran's narrative of the birth is different from the New Testament. The Quran tells that Mary was having childbirth pain. Then she saw a nearby palm tree and held on to it. While she was holding on to the palm tree, a voice came beneath her, beneath the tree. The voice said, "Grieve not! for thy Lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thee; And shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm-tree: It will let fall fresh ripe dates upon thee." Mary then promised not to speak with any man that day. Later, Mary brought Jesus to the temple. All of the men in the temple made fun of her, except Zechariah, who believed in the virgin birth. All of the Israelites questioned her on how could she have a baby without a man. The Virgin Mary pointed to Jesus who spoke his first prophecy.
Mary is one of the most honored and respected figures in Islam and Muslim history. Many women look up to her as an example. Many Muslims consider her to be one of the most righteous women in history. Some Muslims consider her to be a female prophet. Many Muslims also visit Christian shrines. For example, Muslims visit the "Bath of Mary" in Jerusalem. Muslims believe this is where Mary took her first bath. Some plants were named after Mary. One of the plants is the "Kaff Maryam". That plant is used by Muslims women to help pregnancy. The liquid from the plant can also be drunk praying. 
Islamic literature or the Quran does not state the later events of the Virgin Mary's life such as the Assumption. Some Muslim scholars accept that the assumption was a part of the Virgin Mary's life. Some events in Muslim literature are not in the Bible. For example, Mary visited Rome with John and Thaddeus.
"O Mary! Worship your Lord devoutly: prostrate yourself".
"O Mary! Bow down in prayer with those men, who bow down." This is believed to be the command to Mary by the Angels.
"O Mary! God has chosen you and purified you and again he has chosen you above all women of all nations of the worlds"
Mary is believed to have been buried at Tomb of the Virgin Mary in Kidron Valley. The tomb is at the foot of the Mount of Olives.

Knockout

Knockout, also known as the knockout game and knockout king, is a violent activity played by teenagers. The object of the game is to render unconscious (knockout) an innocent pedestrian with one punch. The game can result in serious injuries or death for its victims. Players face criminal charges.
In 1992, a teen stabbed an MIT student through the heart, killing him. In another case, a St. Louis, Missouri teenager allegedly attacked a pedestrian who hit his head on the ground and died in hospital. In May 2013, a 51 year-old man died from his injuries after he was attacked in Syracuse, New York, by two teenagers.

Carmine Crocco

Carmine Crocco (June 5, 1830 – June 18, 1905) was an Italian outlaw. He is also known as Donatello and for his brilliant battle skills was nicknamed “Napoleon of the brigands”.
Born in Rionero in Vulture, a town in the Basilicata region, He began the criminal activity after killing a comrade in a brawl during the military service and joined the Garibaldi's expedition of the thousand in 1860 hoping for a pardon. However, his offence wasn't cleared and Crocco was arrested. He escaped from prison with the help of the Fortunato, a bourgeois family linked to the Bourbon dynasty and became the leader of the peasants rebellion in Basilicata, who didn't get any benefit with the political change.
He fought in the service of king Francis II, heading an army of almost 2.000 men and conquering various centers of Basilicata and Campania. In every conquered territory he overthrew the Savoy government and appointed a representative of the Bourbon crown, ordering the badges and ornaments of the fallen king to be once again displayed. 
A skillful guerrilla man, was able to harass the national guards and the Piedmontese soldiers for almost four years but he lose the conflict after being betrayed by his lieutenant Giuseppe Caruso, who revealed his plans and hideouts to the Italian authorities. Thus he fled to the Papal States hoping for help from Pius IX but was arrested by his soldiers. Later was handed over to the Italian government and condemned to death but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. 
Crocco died in prison at Portoferraio, Tuscany.
A disputable personality, he is considered by some authors a fierce thief and murderer but many people of southern Italy regard him as a folk hero who represented the suffering of the lower class before and soon after the Italian unification.

Nightstand

A nightstand, (could also be called a night table or bedside table) is a small type of table. It is usually placed next to a bed or somewhere else in a bedroom. It is a coffee table which is used next to a person's bed at night time.
Before flushing toilets became common, nightstands usually had a chamber pot in them. Nightstands which were made a long time ago sometimes had a drawer, and they usually had a small cupboard at the bottom. 
Nightstands used today usually also have a drawer. Things like lamps, alarm clocks, mobile phones, water or medication, which could be useful during the night, are often put either on top of or inside nightstands.
French, Italian and Spanish antique nightstands usually have a drawer and a small cupboard with only one door. They can also have special finishes, like bronze.
It is thought that the word "nightstand" was first used in 1892.

Rob Bourdon

Robert Gregory Bourdon (born January 20, 1979) is the drummer and youngest member of the rock band Linkin Park. Bourdon was born in Calabasas, California and now lives in Los Angeles. He grew up in the same town as the members of Incubus and Hoobastank. Bourdon started to play drums after watching an Aerosmith concert. His mother, Patty, is friends with Joey Kramer, Aerosmith's drummer. They also dated when the were much younger. This friendship meant they were able to go backstage and see the entire production. Kramer also gave Bourdon a kick pedal.
In his early teen years, Bourdon played in a few bands with his friends. It was around that time that he met his current Linkin Park bandmate, Brad Delson. They played together for about a year in a band called Relative Degree. Their goal was to play at the Roxy Theatre. After achieving their goal with a sell-out show, Relative Degree eventually broke up.
Bourdon once dated actress Shiri Appleby. He dated actress Vanessa Lee Evigan, starting in 2001 but has been single since at least early 2008. His birthday was featured on an episode of iTunes' LPTV. On January 20, 2004, Linkin Park played a show in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the band can be seen joking around backstage and saying that it is Bourdon's twentieth. Bourdon's favorite songs to play are "In the End", "Tinfoil" and "The Little Things Give You Away". His hobbies include playing the piano (although he has never done so for a Linkin Park recording) and surfing.
Bourdon wears racing shoes to get a better feel for the drum pedals; he says it gives him better control of the pedals. He also said that the song "Easier to Run" was the most difficult to play because he had to approach the drums very differently in which he was able to record the song in a few takes.

Jayne Mansfield

Jayne Mansfield (born Vera Jayne Palmer; April 19, 1933 – June 29, 1967) was an American movie, stage, and television actress. She was also a nightclub entertainer, a singer, and one of the early "Playboy" Playmates. Mansfield became a major Broadway star in 1955, a major movie star in 1956, and a major celebrity in 1957. 
Mansfield was the only child of Herbert William Palmer (1904–1936) and Vera Jeffrey Palmer (1903–2000). She was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Her father was of German descent and her mother was of English descent. 
After her father's death in 1936, Jayne, her mother, and stepfather Harry Lawrence Peers moved to Dallas, Texas. After high school graduation, she studied acting at Southern Methodist University and the University of Texas at Austin. 
While in college, she had a number of small jobs such as hat check girl and nightclub photographer. She won many beauty pageants. She performed in local theater productions around Austin.
In 1955, Mansfield went to New York City. She appeared in the Broadway production of "Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?" The critics praised her performance. She appeared in 400 plus shows of the play between 1955 and 1956.
She went to Hollywood in 1956. 20th Century Fox signed her to a six-year contract in an effort to replace the troubled Marilyn Monroe. Her first starring movie role was Jerri Jordan in "The Girl Can't Help It" (1956).
During production, she still appeared on Broadway in "Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?" The movie studio finally bought out her contract, and shut the show down. In 1957, she appeared in a movie version of the play. 
Mansfield's movies include "The Wayward Bus" (1957), "Too Hot to Handle" (1960), and "Promises! Promises!" (1963). She won the Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer - Female for "The Wayward Bus". On television, she made guest appearances on drama series, game shows, variety shows, and many talk shows.
Mansfield was one of Hollywood's original blonde bombshells. When the demand for big-breasted blonde bombshells decreased in the early 1960s, she became a box-office has-been.
She remained a popular celebrity however. Her nightclub acts and summer theater appearances attracted crowds. She made cheap "indies" and European melodramas and comedies. 
Mansfield became the first major American actress to have a nude starring role in a Hollywood movie. The movie was "Promises! Promises!". Hugh Hefner published nude photographs of Mansfield on the movie set in the June 1963 issue of "Playboy". He was hauled into Chicago city court on obscenity charges.
Mansfield married public relations professional Paul Mansfield in 1950. They had one daughter, Jayne Marie Mansfield. The couple divorced in 1956. Jayne kept "Mansfield" as her professional name. 
She married actor-bodybuilder Mickey Hargitay in 1958. They had three children, Miklós Jeffrey Palmer Hargitay, Zoltán Anthony Hargitay, and Mariska Magdolna Hargitay. They divorced in 1963. 
She married Italian-born movie director Matt Cimber (a.k.a. Matteo Ottaviano, né Thomas Vitale Ottaviano) in 1964. They had one son, Antonio Raphael Ottaviano (Tony Cimber). The couple separated in 1966. Their divorce was pending when Mansfield was killed in 1967.
Mansfield was killed in a car crash in June 1967. She was going to New Orleans for a television interview when her car crashed into the back of a truck. Her lover Sam Brody and her driver Ronnie Harrison were also killed. Three of her children - Miklós, Zoltán and Mariska - escaped death with minor injuries. An urban legend about Mansfield being decapitated in the crash is untrue. She was buried on 3 July in Pennsylvania. Her gravestone is heart-shaped.

Edward Doty

Edward Doty (c. 1599 – August 23, 1655 in Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay Colony).
Edward Doty was a passenger on the historic 1620 voyage of the "Mayflower". He was a servant to Stephen Hopkins. Hopkins was making his second journey to the New World having travelled for ten years under Capt. John Smith at Jamestown in Virginia Colony.
Doty was born in England. It is thought he was from East Halton in Lincolnshire. According to author Charles Banks, Doty lived in London at some point and traveled with another Londoner, Stephen Hopkins, as his servant.
Edward Doty left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" spotted land. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land 21 November at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.
Doty was one of two indentured servants of Stephen Hopkins. The other servant was Edward Leister. They travelled with Hopkins and his family.
When they landed the men went to find a place where they could live and grow crops. One of the first exploration missions included William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish , Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Doty. According to William Bradford, they left in a small board in below freezing weather. Many of the men were already ill. Bradford wrote that when they set sail the salt spray froze on their coats, as if they had been glazed. Of this group Hopkins was the most experienced, having seen Native Americans during his time at Jamestown. During this trip the "Mayflower" men came upon some Native Americans who appeared to be cutting up a large whale. The Natives ran when they saw the men. The men camped while trying to protect themselves and stay warm. 
In late 1620, Doty went with Stephen Hopkins and others on other explorations of the Cape Cod area.
Doty was one of the "Mayflower" passengers that has left a record of his personality. He had a quick temper that sometimes caused him trouble. Some said he was an unfair businessman. People who made trouble were often banished from Plymouth. Isaac Allerton was forced out. Doty must have changed for the better because he lived in Plymouth his whole life.
Edward Doty became a rich land owner with servants himself. At times, he could be disagreeable with others. This caused him to be in the Plymouth court many times.
Doty’s first problem with the law came after the Pilgrims had begun building their settlement. In June of 1621 Doty fought a duel (with a sword and dagger) with Edward Leister. Edward Leister was the other servant of Stephen Hopkins. The result was that one man was wounded in the hand and one in the thigh. Their punishment was to be tied head and feet together for one day without food or drink. But soon their master Stephen Hopkins felt sorry for them and asked to end their punishment. He promised they would change their behavior. The Governor let them free.
In the 1623 Division of Land, Doty received 1 acre of land. After that he received 20 acres more. He also purchased much land and became quite wealthy. Some of his land in Plymouth is where the Mayflower Society House now stands.
Doty received some cattle in the 1627 Division of the Cattle. At that time he had finished his term of service to Stephen Hopkins. His name as “Edward Dolton”, is listed with the family of John Howland and wife Elizabeth. In Plymouth Colony records, Doty’s name was also spelled variously as Doten (Mayflower Compact), Dotey (1626 Purchasers and 1643 bear arms lists), Dolton (1627 Division of the Cattle), and Dowty (1633/34 tax lists). 
The 1632 records of the Plymouth Court has twenty-three cases that mentions Edward Doty. There were complaints that he cheated people, said bad things about people which were not true, fought with people, and stole. Doty was never punished except for paying small fines. This means that most of the cases were found to be untrue or very minor cases. Except for the duel in 1621, he never had any physical punishment. Physical punishment could have been whipping, branding, banishment, prison and public punishment.
Except for his occasional court cases, Doty lived a normal life as a freeman, paying his taxes and all his debts. He received some special property rights and benefits from being classed as a “first comer” or "Mayflower" passenger.
The joined with other members of the community in a town meeting of February 10, 1643. He was assigned with George Clark, John Shaw, Francis Billington and others to build a wolf trap in the town of Plain Dealing.”
Doty's name appears on the August 1643 Able to Bear Arms (ATBA) List. It is spelled “Edward Dotey”. This was for the protection of the colony against unfriendly Indians or other enemies.
Edward Doty married Faith Clarke. They had nine children.
The parents of Faith Clarke on January 9, 1635 were Thurston (Tristram) and Faith Clarke. They arrived in Plymouth Colony on the ship “Francis” in 1634. Many of Doty’s court cases involved Thurston and George Clarke. He had many disagreements, including fights with the family of his wife. Bradford wrote that Doty by a second wife has seven children, and all are living. They had two more children after he wrote that.
The children were named Edward, Thomas, John, Samuel, Desire, Isaac, Elizabeth, Joseph, Mary.
Edward Doty made out his will on May 20, 1655. Doty said that he was sick but still had a good memory. His will was witnessed by John Howland, John Cooke, James Hurst, and William Hoskins. Doty signed his will with a mark because he never learned to write.
Edward Doty died on August 23, 1655 in Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay Colony and was buried at Burial Hill Cemetery where there is a memorial stone for him.

Cinquecento

Cinquecento (in English: Five hundred) is an Italian term used to describe the Italian Renaissance of the 16th century, including the related styles of art, music, literature, and architecture. It is considered the century when Italy was the leader in the European civilization 
In the Cinquecento the most important center of culture in Italy was Rome, while Florence suffered from the Girolamo Savonarola rebellion and the end of the Medici power in the city.
Indeed, in Rome the Pope promoted a huge art program (like the construction of St. Peter Cathedral and the Sistine Chapel) that brought to the eternal city artists of the level of Michelangelo, Raphael, Cellini, and Bramante.
Michelangelo Buonarroti was one the most famous artists in the Cinquecento Italy: he was a painter, sculptor, architect, poet, and engineer. Along with Leonardo da Vinci, he was often called a "Renaissance man" which means that he had great talent in many areas. Michelangelo lived an extremely busy life, creating a great number of artworks. Some of Michelangelo's works are among the most famous that have ever been made. They include two very famous marble statues, "the Pieta" in Saint Peter's Basilica and "David" which once stood in a piazza in Florence but is now in the Accademia Gallery. His most famous paintings were huge frescos, the Sistine Chapel Ceiling and the "Last Judgement". His most famous work of architecture was the east end and dome of Saint Peter's Basilica.
Only Venice in Italy was able to reach a similar level to the one of Rome, mainly in paintings: Bellini, Giorgione and Tiziano created their masterpieces in this century.
The tuscan Leonardo da Vinci lived the last years of his life in the Cinquecento. He created in this century two of his pictures that are among the best-known paintings in the world: the "Mona Lisa" and the "Last Supper".
In 1532 The Prince -a masterpiece of Italian literature- was published: it was a political treatise by the Italian diplomat, historian and political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli.
In architecture the Cinquecento is famous because of Andrea Palladio (1508–80), "the most influential architect of the whole Renaissance". Palladio was to transform the architectural style of both palaces and churches by taking a different perspective on the notion of Classicism. While the architects of Florence and Rome looked to structures like the Colosseum and the Arch of Constantine to provide formulae, Palladio looked to classical temples with their simple peristyle form.
When he used the “triumphal arch” motif of a large arched opening with lower square-topped opening on either side, he invariably applied it on a small scale, such as windows, rather than on a large scale as Alberti used it at Sant’Andrea’s. This Ancient Roman motif is often referred to as the "Palladian Arch".
The second half of the Cinquecento was characterized by the development of the "Umanesimo", related even to science discoveries like the one done by Galileo Galilei in astronomy and critical thoughts like those of Giordano Bruno.
Historically the Cinquecento is characterized by the end of the process of unification of Italy, because of the French invasions and the "Sack of Rome" in 1527. Later in the century Italy was devastated by the "Italian wars" done mainly between France and the emerging Spain (a new country that enjoyed the richness and power from the discovery of America done by Cristoforo Colombo), that divided between themselves the Italian peninsula and its "Rinascimento richness".

He is the father of actress Mariska Hargitay. During their marriage, Hargitay and Mansfield made four movies together. These were "Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?" (1957), "The Loves of Hercules" (1960), "Promises! Promises!" (1963), and "L'Amore Primitivo" (1964).

The two had met the year before at "The Mae West Show" at the Latin Quarter nightclub. When Jayne saw Mickey on the stage, she told the waiter, "I’ll have a steak and that tall man on the left." 
The two fell head over heels in love. They were never seen apart. 20th Century Fox didn't want Hargitay in "Rock Hunter", because they hated Mansfield's idea of Hargitay as her "only" lover. Fox liked their sex symbols to be single. But when Jayne told the studio that she would turn the movie down, they gave in and let Hargitay appear in a bit part. 
In 1960, Jayne and Mickey would play the lead roles in "The Loves of Hercules". The movie was shot in Italy. It was never released in the United States. Over the next few years Mickey and Jayne, together, would appear in, "Promises! Promises!" (1963) and "L'Amore Primitivo" (1964).

Hargitay's last acting appearance was in an episode of his daughter Mariska's series, "". In the episode "Control" (2003), Hargitay played a man on a subway station escalator who witnesses the aftermath of a brutal assault. Mariska's character, Olivia Benson, is later seen interviewing him.
His first marriage was to Mary Birge. Together they had a daughter Tina Hargitay (b. 1949). They divorced on September 6, 1956.
Hargitay and Mansfield married on January 13, 1958. They had three children: Miklós Jeffrey Palmer Hargitay (b. December, 21 1958), Zoltán Anthony Hargitay (b. August 1, 1960), and Mariska Magdolna Hargitay (called Maria, b. January 23, 1964). 
Hargitay remodeled much of his and Mansfield's Beverly Hills mansion, "The Pink Palace". He built its famous heart-shaped swimming pool. In November 2002, the house was razed by developers. 
In May 1963, Mickey and Jayne divorced in Mexico. The divorce was ruled invalid. The two reconciled in October 1963. After Mariska's birth, Mansfield sued for the Mexican divorce to be declared legal. She won. The divorce was recognized in the United States on August 26, 1964. After Mansfield's death in a car crash on June 29, 1967, Hargitay sued Jayne's estate for over $5,000 to support the children. In their divorce decree, she had agreed to pay child support and to give him approximately $70,000 in cash and property.

Conus is a large genus of small to large predatory sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs, with the common names of "cone snails", "cone shells" or "cones". 
Shaped, as the name suggests, like a cone, many species have colorful patterning on the shell surface. "Conus" snails are mostly tropical in distribution. Geologically speaking, the genus is known from the Eocene to the present. 
All "Conus" snails are poisonous. They hunt and eat marine worms or molluscs. The larger ones prey on small bottom-dwelling fish. Cone snails use a hypodermic-like modified radula tooth and a venom gland to attack and paralyze their prey before eating it. The tooth is sometimes likened to a dart or a harpoon. It is barbed and can be extended some distance out from the mouth of the snail, at the end of the proboscis. They can "sting" humans, and should be handled with great care or preferably not at all. 
Cone snail venoms are mainly peptides. The venoms contain many different toxins that vary in their effects; some are extremely toxic. The sting of small cones is no worse than a bee sting, but the sting of some larger species can be serious, occasionally even fatal to humans. According to Goldfrank's "Toxicologic emergencies", only about 15 human deaths were caused by cone snail stings. 
Cone snail venom has promise as a source of new, medically important substances.

Inflation (cosmology)

In physical cosmology, the idea of inflation is a proposed theory that would explain many features of the present-day universe, including the existence of large-scale structures such as galaxies. The theory was proposed by Alan Guth in the 1970s. 
Based on the Standard Model of Cosmology, the universe has been and is expanding. The classical Big Bang theory assumes that the universe expanded at the same rate throughout universal history. Inflation says that the universe "has not" always expanded at the same rate, and that the universe has experienced many periods of brief but immense expansions in which the size of the universe nearly doubled. These periods, as said, were extremely short, lasting less than a second. After a single period, the expansion slowed down until the next rapid inflation came and, again, massively increased the size of the universe. 
The main problem solved by inflation is the origin of large-scale structures, such as galaxies. Inflation theory says that in a slow expansion of the universe, quantum fluctuations were only on the tiny distance scales; when the universe experienced a brief period of inflation, however, these quantum fluctuations are "stretched" much larger to cause density fluctuations. The places of higher density later caused matter to clump in those locations and form large-scale objects. 
Another problem is that of temperature uniformity in the universe: why is the temperature so evenly distributed? Inflation says that objects that were previously in close proximity to one another were separated very quickly during a period of inflation, so the temperature balance was still held. In the classical Big Bang theory this was a problem because the uniform expansion would mean that objects would have to travel many times the speed of light to maintain temperature balance. 
Another problem that inflation possibly solves is the problem of magnetic monopoles. Why do we no longer see magnetic monopoles in our universe? Inflation says that the few existing monopoles were so dispersed during periods of inflation that it is virtually impossible to find them now. 
Inflation theory uses General relativity to model the inflation mathematically. The metric of inflation theory is
formula_1
The main prediction of inflation theory is that particles called inflatons are created from a scalar field from Quantum field theory. These inflatons would drive the inflation periods of the universe, but they quickly decay so the inflation periods are not very long at all. It was initially thought that the Higgs boson was an inflaton, but that has recently been discredited. 
Inflation theory also suggests that there might be other universes. If inflation caused our universe, could it not also cause many other universes as well? This prediction has no empirical basis, but it has been explored in modern physics.

Conidae

Conidae is a family of minute to quite large sea snails. They are marine gastropod molluscs in the superfamily Conoidea. Their beautiful shells are highly collectible.
The snails within this family are sophisticated predatory animals. The snails have eyes, and are active hunters. They immobilize prey with a modified radular tooth. The tooth delivers venom with neurotoxins; it is launched out of the snail's mouth in a harpoon-like action.
There have been many suggested changes to the classification of cone shells, and the details are still under investigation. The very large genus "Conus" has 600 species, and there are six other subfamilies.

The Phoenician alphabet was an alphabetic script that was used in the territories of modern-day Lebanon, Syria and Palestine from about the 12th century to the 5th century BC. It was written right to left. Only consonant sounds are written down, some versions have "helpers" for certain vowels.
It was used to write languages such as Phoenician and Aramaic. The script was developed from the earlier Proto-Sinaitic script. Later, the script developed into the Ancient Greek script. Most alphabetic scripts in use today, are derived from the Phoenician alphabet.
Before using the modern Arabic numerals, the Arabic language used a system where each letter also had a numeric value; this system is known as Abjad.

Electronic waste, or E-waste is electronic equipment that is being thrown away. It includes phones, computers, and other electronics that have passed their time and are not used any more.
E-waste is an ongoing concern for every country in the 21st century. Because of Moore's law, the rule that states transistor numbers double every two years, most people need to keep up to speed by upgrading computers every 3 years on average. People usually throw away their old laptops, cameras, computers, cell phones and televisions. This creates a large amount of practically useless waste. Most countries have methods to combat e waste and find a use for obsolete technology. When you take in to account all the computer users in the world, over 30 million tons of e-waste is created nearly every year.

Gorboduc

The Tragedy of Gorboduc is the earliest English tragedy in blank verse. It was written by Thomas Sackville and Thomas Norton. The writers took the story of the play from Geoffrey of Monmouth's "History of the Kings of Britain" (1138). The play premiered before Queen Elizabeth I on 18 January 1561. It was first printed in 1565. It was printed again in 1570 as "The Tragedy of Ferrex and Porrex".
The play is about a good king named Gorboduc. He gives his kingdom away during his lifetime to his sons. The sons quarrel over the throne. Porrex, the younger son, kills his brother, Ferrex. Their mother, Queen Videna, avenges the death of her older son by murdering Porrex. Gorboduc and Videna are then killed by their horrified former subjects.
Norton wrote the first three acts; Sackville wrote the last two. The playwrights took the tragedies of the Latin writer Seneca as their model, but ignored the classical unities of time and place. They used Classical elements such as the Chorus and the Messenger, but added non-Classical elements such as dumb shows (pantomimes) before each act.

Governorate of Dalmatia

The Governorship of Dalmatia (or "Governatorato di Dalmazia" in Italian) was a territory united to the Kingdom of Italy in April 1941, after the military conquest of the Jugoslavian Dalmatia by Italian general Vittorio Ambrosio during WWII. It lasted until september 1943.
The Governorship of Dalmatia was made up of parts of coastal Kingdom of Yugoslavia that were occupied and annexed by Italy from April 1941 to September 1943. Italy already had, since 1919, the Italian Province of Zara ("Provincia di Zara") on the Dalmatian coastline with Zara as capital and the island of Lagosta (actually called Lastovo) after World War I (for a total area of about 200 square kilometers).
The creation of the Governorship of Dalmatia fulfilled the requests of the Italian Irredentism, that already were expressed during the "Incidents of Spalato". But not all of Dalmatia was annexed by Italy, as the German puppet state - the Independent State of Croatia - took some sections of the Dalmatian areas, though the Italian army held control over all of Dalmatia.
The Kingdom of Italy divided the Governorship in three Italian provinces: "Zara" (Zadar), "Spalato" (Split) and "Cattaro" (Kotor), but never created officially an Italian region with the name "Dalmatia" (waiting for the future peace conference). While the Governorship was not officially a region of Italy, the northern Dalmatian islands of Krk ("Veglia") and Rab ("Arbe") were administratively united to the Italian province of Fiume and became areas of the Kingdom of Italy.
In September 1941, Italy's fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini, ordered the military occupation of the entire Dalmatian coast and islands (like Ragusa, Lissa, and Pago) that belonged to fascist Croatia of Ante Pavelić: he tried to annex those areas to the Governorship of Dalmatia, but was temporarily stopped by the strong opposition of Pavelić, who retained nominal control of those areas. 
The northern dalmatian islands of Krk and Rab were not added to the Governorship of Dalmatia, but were added to the Italian "Province of Fiume". This province was enlarged with areas of northern coastal Dalmatia to the east of Fiume.
The Governatorate of Dalmatia consisted of three provinces: Zara, Cattaro and Spalato. The administrative capital was Zara. After autumn 1941 also the Dalmatian islands of Pago and Lesina, initially given to the croatian dictator Ante Pavelic, were annexed. These islands were occupied militarily by the Italian army, along with an area of fascist Croatia that was off the coast of Segna to the center of Bosnia (near Sarajevo and Banja Luka).
After the Kingdom of Italy changed sides to the Allies in 1943, German forces took over the area. This territory was not given to the fascist Italian Social Republic (which was a puppet state of Nazi Germany), but instead completely dissolved and added to the puppet Independent State of Croatia. 
But Zara remained Italian (even under control of the German Army) until 1945 (the city suffered a terrible bombing in 1944).

Are We Not Men? We Are Devo!

Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! is the first album released by the American new wave music band Devo. This album was produced by Brian Eno, recorded mostly in Cologne, Germany and released in the U.S. by Warner Bros. Records company in 1978.
The album received mixed reviews from critics when it was released. It reached number 12 on the UK album charts and number 78 on the U.S. "Billboard" charts. Recent reviews of the album have been mostly positive. This album is included on many "best of" lists from magazines such as "Rolling Stone", Pitchfork Media and "Spin".
Devo played the whole album live on stage for the first time on May 6, 2009. It was a part of the Don't Look Back (concert series)|Don't Look Back concert series. On September 16, 2009, Warner Bros. and Devo said they would re-release "Q: Are We Not Men?" and "Freedom of Choice", and that Devo would tour and perform both albums.
The first reaction by critics to "Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!" was mixed. Tom Carson, wrote in "Rolling Stone" that "There's not an ounce of feeling anywhere, and the only commitment is to the distancing aesthetic of the put-on", and opined that "Devo lacks most of Eno's warmth and much of Bowie's flair for mechanized melodrama. For all its idiosyncrasies, the music here is utterly impersonal." Critic Robert Christgau gave the album a positive rating of a B+, but noted, "In small doses it's as good as novelty music ever gets, and there isn't a really bad cut on this album. But it leads nowhere." It was voted one of the best albums of the year in the "Village Voice"'s Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1978. In January 1980, "Trouser Press" also named it one of the best albums of 1978.
Later reception of the album has been mostly positive. Steve Huey of the online music database Allmusic scored the album four and a half "stars" calling it "arguably Devo's strongest set of material, though several brilliant peaks can overshadow the remainder", and "a seminal touchstone in the development of American new wave." "Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!" is on "best of" lists, including "Spin"'s 50 Most Essential Punk Records, Pitchfork Media's top 100 albums of 1970s and "Rolling Stone"'s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
It is also listed in the book "1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die".

Geosynchronous orbit

A geosynchronous orbit is an orbit at a height of above sea level on the Earth. At this height, the orbit takes 24 hours, so it is "in sync" with the land on Earth (the 'geo' part of geosynchronous). 
The geostationary orbit is the most common type of geosynchronous orbit. This is right above the equator, so the satellites in this orbit do not swing north or south, but stay perfectly still above a point on the equator. This is useful for communication satellites (including satellite TV).
Geosynchronous also includes orbits that are not above the equator, but since every orbit goes around the center of the Earth, the satellite must spend an equal amount of time north of the equator as it does south of the equator, so it appears to slide up and down when viewed from the Earth.

John Howland

John Howland (c. 1591 – February 23, 1672/3) was a passenger on the "Mayflower". He was an indentured servant to John Carver and travelled with him when they left England to settle in the New World. He signed the Mayflower Compact and helped to build Plymouth Colony.
John Howland was born in Fenstanton, Huntingdon, England around 1591 and was the son of Margaret and Henry Howland, and the brother of Henry and Arthur Howland. The brothers travelled later from England to Plymouth.
The Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. The first few days had good weather. They ran into a great storm with heavy winds and large waves. For days the ship could not use it's sails. The first mention of him was by William Bradford. During the storm Howland was walking on deck and was washed overboard by a large wave. He somehow caught a rope and was pulled to safety. In all there were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21.
They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.
When the "Mayflower" landed several men went to land to try to find a place where they could live. One of the earliest exploration missions included William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Doty. Hopkins was the most experienced. He had seen Native Americans when he was at Jamestown. According to Bradford, they set off in below freezing weather, many of the men already being ill, "and when the set sail the salt spray froze on their coats, as if they had been glazed". During their trip they saw Indians who looked like they were cutting up a large whale. When the Indians saw the men they ran away. The men camped and protected themselves from the cold and the Indians.
Half of the Pilgrims died by the end of the first winter. Howland lived with the Carver family The following spring, on an very warm day in April, Governor Carver was planting corn when he came out of a cornfield feeling ill and he soon died. Carver was much loved by the passengers. He was a wealthy man who very hard worked along with all of the pilgrims. Bradford wrote Carver had worked himself to death. After Carver's death, Howland became a freeman. This meant that he could own his own land and could vote in Plymouth affairs. Howland was given an acre for each member of the Carver household including himself and Elizabeth Tilley, Desire Minter, and a boy named William Latham.
Howland was one of eight settlers who agreed to help to pay the colony's debt to the men in England who had paid for the voyage. From 1641-1655 Howland was voted deputy to the Massachusetts General Court. He was elected again in 1658.
Howland went with Edward Winslow to exploration of Kennebec River (in current day Maine), looking for possible fur trading sites and natural resources that the colony could use. While Howland was in charge of the colony's trading post, an sad incident happened there. William Bradford wrote was that it was "one of the saddest things that befell the Pilgrims." A group of traders from the Piscataqua River, was led by a man named John Hocking. Hocking started to trade in an area that did not belong to him. Howland warned Hocking to depart, but Hocking, took out a pistol and refused. Howland ordered his men to set the canoe adrift. The Plymouth men managed to cut one cable when Hocking put his pistol to the head of Moses Talbot, one of Howland's men, and shot and killed him. Another of the Howland group shot Hocking.
In Plymouth the Howlands lived on the north side of Leyden Street. They lived in other places such as Duxbury and Kingston where they had a farm. The farm burned down in 1675 during King Philip's War. By that time, John had died and Elizabeth moved in with her son, Jabez.
Until Bradford's "Of Plymouth Plantation" was discovered in 1856, it was presumed that John Howland's wife, formerly Elizabeth Tilley was the adopted daughter of Carver's. Actually her parents, uncle and aunt came to the New World but died of sickness during the first winter.) This mistake was even recorded on a gravestone that was erected for Howland on Burial Hill, in 1836.
They had ten children. Desire, John, Hope, Elizabeth, Lydia, Hannah, Joseph, Jabez, Ruth and Isaac.
John Howland died February 23, 1673 at the age of 80. He had outlived all other male "Mayflower" passengers except John Cooke, son of Mayflower passenger Francis Cooke. He is buried on Burial Hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts.

Million Dollar Password

Million Dollar Password is a television game show that aired on CBS. It is an updated version of the game show "Password". It aired from June 1, 2008 to June 14, 2009. It was hosted by Regis Philbin.
The game is played in two parts. The first part of the game has two contestants and two celebrities. Both contestants play 30-second rounds where they try to get five words from clues given by their celebrity partner. Clues have to be one word. The celebrity can give as many clues as they want for each word. They must wait for a response from the contestant before giving a new clue. Only one clue can be given at a time. After each contestant plays, they switch partners. The contestant who gets the most words after four rounds wins and moves on to the Million Dollar Password round. If the contestants are tied after four rounds, a tie-breaking word is given to both teams, starting with the team who won a coin toss. The contestant who gets the word wins.
This round has a six-step prize ladder with a top prize of $1,000,000. The contestant's celebrity partner is the one who they got the most words with. If they got the same amount of words with both celebrities, their partner is the one that they last played with. The contestant can give or receive the clues for this round. For each step of the ladder, the clue giver has to get their partner to say five words in 90 seconds. Up to three clues can be given for each word. The clue giver can pass on a word, but cannot come back to it.
If the clue giver is successful in getting their partner to say five words, the contestant wins the amount on the level that they are on. They can then decide if they want to take the money they have or go on to the next level. Each level has one less word than the last one. If a contestant fails on a level, the game ends. Failing on the first two levels means that the contestant leaves with nothing. Failing on the $50,000, $100,000 or $250,000 levels means that the contestant leaves with $25,000. If the contestant gets to the $250,000 level, they can play the $1,000,000 level with no risk of losing the $250,000.
If the contestant is giving the clues, starting at the $250,000 level, they are shown the words for that level before they decide if they want to take the money they have or go on to the next level.

Typically, a harpoon for fishing has backwards-pointing barbs which stop the fish getting free.

Libertarian Party (United States)

The Libertarian Party is a political party in the United States, founded in 1971.
It is the third largest political party in the United States in terms of the popular vote in the country's elections and number of candidates run per election, and it is also identified by many as the fastest growing political party in the United States.
The political ideas of the Libertarian Party reflect the ideas of libertarianism: supporting less regulated markets, a less powerful state, strong civil liberties (favoring same-sex marriage and other LGBT rights), the legalization of cannabis, separation of church and state, open immigration, neutrality in diplomatic issues, staying out of other countries' wars, freedom of trade and travel to all foreign countries, and a better democracy. They also support the right to own guns.
The Libertarian Party has also supported the United States' exit from the United Nations and other organizations. Although there is not a "left" or "right" wing label to the party, it is considered by many to be more left-wing than the Republican Party but more right-wing than the Democratic Party. Many members say they are more socially liberal than the Democrats, but more conservative with money than the Republicans.
As of March 2016, there are over 410,000 voters registered as Libertarians. Hundreds of Libertarian candidates have been elected or appointed to public office, and thousands have run for office under the Libertarian banner.
The Libertarian Party has had a number of records, such as being the first party to get an electoral vote for a woman in a United States presidential election. On May 5, 2012, Gary Johnson received the Libertarian Party's official nomination for President of the United States in the 2012 election. In 2016, Johnson once again became the party's nominee with running mate William Weld. They would go on to win the most number of popular votes in the party's history.

Begoniaceae

The Begoniaceae are a family of flowering plants with about 1400-1500 species occurring in the subtropics and tropics of both the New World and Old World. All but one of the species are in the genus "Begonia". The only other genus in the family, "Hillebrandia", is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands and has only one species.
Many varieties (or cultivars) of some species and hybrids of the genus "Begonia" are used as ornamental plants.
Most of the plants in this family are perennial herbaceous plants and very few are shrubs o subshrubs; they are from only a few centimetres to 3 metres tall. Their leaves and stems are succulents, that is, leaves and stems are juicy and store water.
Stems are upright (vertical) and many species form rhizomes or tubers (fleshy, thickened underground stems). In some cases, the stems are very short and the leaves are in a group close to the soil.
The leaves of most species are simple, undivided and with sides more or less unequal; in very few cases they are compound (divided). They are alternate or, when the stem is very short, they are all in a group.
Begoniaceae plants are mostly monoecious, so there are male and female flowers on the same plant; very few are dioecious, with only one kind of flower so the plants are either male or female. Flowers are grouped in inflorescences.
The fruits are capsules (simple, dry fruits) and sometimes berries; they have many very small seeds.
The chromosome number is variable, n=10-21 or more.
The family Begoniaceae was named in 1820 as Begoniae by the Bohemian scientists Friedrich Graf von Berchtold and Jan Svatopluk Presl in "Prirozenosti Rostlin", 1:270, and then in 1824 as Begoniaceae by the Swedish botanist Carl Adolph Agardh, published in "Aphorismi Botanici".
There are two genera in this family:
The New Guinean genus "Symbegonia" Warb. has recently been reduced to a section of "Begonia".
The species of this family are found abundantly in all moist tropical countries, absent only from the Australian tropical forests.
One species, "B. grandis" grows in the temperate zone, growing as far north as near Beijing (China).
Some species, hybrids and cultivars of the genus "Begonia" are used worldwide as ornamental plants in parks, gardens, balconies and as houseplants because they have beautiful leaves and flowers.

Vegetative reproduction

Vegetative reproduction is a kind of asexual reproduction. It can be found in plants, and lower organisms, for example unicellular organisms. It occurs naturally, and can also be caused on purpose by horticulturists. Vegetative reproduction uses Mitosis. This means that the newly created cell is a clone, and identical to the parent cell.
By this process, new plants can be grown naturally without any seeds or spores. Therefore, it is widely used especially in agriculture to spread the trees that are of great value to the economy. 
When it occurs naturally, it can be in different ways. Some plants put out new roots underground, have bulbs, or grow new vines and shoots above ground. 
In gardening and farming, vegetative reproduction means cutting a tree branch below its center joint, planting it in some other earth, and letting it form new roots. In this way, many kinds of useful plants can be easily reproduced without any seeds, for example: apple, avocado, banana, cacao, hemp, orange/lemon, date, fig, grape, almond, pineapple, potato, strawberry, sugar cane and tea.

Promises! Promises! is a 1963 movie. It was the first Hollywood sound movie to feature a major star—Jayne Mansfield—in the nude. She was in three nude scenes that together lasted a bit over a minute.
"Playboy" publisher Hugh Hefner was charged with obscenity when he printed nude photos of Mansfield on the set in his magazine. The movie was banned in some American cities. It was a big box office success in cities where it was shown. 
Sandy Brooks (Jayne Mansfield) wants to get pregnant. Her husband Jeff (Tommy Noonan) is too stressed out with work to make love to her. They take a cruise, and meet another couple (Marie McDonald and Mickey Hargitay). 
The four get drunk. They change partners when going to their rooms. Later, both women learn they're pregnant. They wonder whether the fathers are their own or the other's husband.
"Promises! Promises!" was the first Hollywood sound movie to feature a big star in the nude. For some, the nude scenes were the movie's main attraction.
Together, these three scenes last a little bit over one minute. Mansfield was seen only topless in the movie, but the book "Hollywood Babylon" shows her on the set completely nude. Her pubic hair can be seen.
In June 1963, "Playboy" published a photo article about the movie. In the photos, Mansfield plays with one of her breasts. Publisher Hugh Hefner was arrested and charged with obscenity. He was acquitted by the jury.
"Promises! Promises!" was banned in several American cities. Both the original movie and an edited version had box office success in places where it was not banned. 
Mansfield was voted one of the Top 10 Box Office Attractions by theater owners that year. Movie critic Roger Ebert wrote about Mansfield, "Finally in "Promises! Promises!" she does what no Hollywood star ever does except in desperation. She does a nudie. In 1963, that kind of box office appeal was all she had left."

Scott Foundas of "Variety", said that "So rife with underdog victors and hairpin twists of fortune that, if it weren't all true, no one would believe it." Duane Byrge, writing in "The Hollywood Reporter", praised the movie. He said that "The Battered Bastards of Baseball is not just about baseball. It transcends the game and is a charming anti-establishment yarn that should delight audiences who don't even know an r.b.i. from a balk."
Dustin Krcatovich, from "Esquire", wrote "easily one of the most raucously entertaining films to come out this year, and the best sports documentary in a while." Katie Walsh of "Indiewire" gave the movie a B+ grade. She said "The Batterered Bastards of Baseball is an entertaining celebration of the independent spirit and the love of the game."
The "New York Daily News" listed the documentary as one of the 10 best movies of 2014.
Russell died from cancer on April 8, 2003 in Thousand Oaks, California.

He made his first movie appearance in 1916 in a movie serial as an extra. At this time, he also appeared as a supporting player in several movies. Director D. W. Griffith saw him. He cast Barthelmess opposite Lillian Gish in "Broken Blossoms" (1919) and "Way Down East" (1920). 
He soon became one of Hollywood's highest paid actors. He was nominated for Best Actor at the first Academy Awards in 1928. He founded a production company, Inspiration Film Company. He starred in the company's "Tol'able David" (1921). This movie was a great success.
Barthelmess made several "talkies". He failed to hold on to the star status of his silent movie days. He joined the United States Navy Reserve during World War II. He was a lieutenant commander. He never went back to movies. He died of cancer in 1963. He was 68. He was buried at Ferncliff Cemetery and Mausoleum in Hartsdale, New York.
Barthelmess married Mary Hay, a stage and movie star. They had one daughter Mary Barthelmess. In 1927, Barthelmess became engaged to Katherine Young Wilson, a Broadway actress. The engagement was called off, possibly due to his affair around this time with the journalist Adela Rogers St. Johns. In 1928, Barthelmess married Jessica Stewart Sargent.
Barthelmess was one of the founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Barthelmess received the George Eastman Award for distinguished contribution to movies.
Composer Katherine Allan Lively dedicated her piano piece, "Within the Walls of China: A Chinese Episode", to Barthelmess. It was published in 1923 by G. Schirmer, Inc. An article in "The Music Trades" reported that Mrs. Lively was inspired by a seeing "Broken Blossoms". She played the piece for Barthelmess and his friends in New York in the summer of 1922.

Manasa

Manasa (, Manasha) also known as Manasa Devi is the Hindu goddess of snakes and poison. She is mainly worshiped by Hindus for the prevention and cure of snakebites and infectious diseases like smallpox and chicken pox as well as for prosperity and fertility. She is also known as Vishahara (the destroyer of poison), Jagadgaurī, Nityā (eternal) and Padmavati. She stands for both 'destruction' and 'regeneration', almost akin to a snake shedding its skin and being reborn.
Originally Manasa was a Adivasi(tribal) goddess. Manasa was accepted into the Hindu pantheon ( groups of gods and goddesses ) by the lower caste. Later Manasa Swas accepted by the higher caste. She is now regarded as a Hindu goddess rather than a tribal one. 
The idol of the goddess is depicted as a graceful lady with her body, adorned with snakes and sitting on a lotus or standing on a snake, under a hooded canopy of seven cobras with usually a geese next to her. She is often seen as 'the one-eyed goddess', and sometimes portrayed with her son Astika on her lap. Her one eye is due to a belief that her stepmother Chandi burnt one of her eyes out of jealousy.
 Her myths are emphasize by her bad temper and unhappiness because in many beliefs, her father, Shiva, rejected her and her step-mother Chandi hated her. In some scriptures, Kashyapa is considered to be her father. Her legends are based on her life.
The Mahabharata tells about her marriage. Sage Jagatkāru decided to abstain of marriage. He came across a group of men who were hanging upside down from a tree. These men were his ancestor who were doomed because their children did not perform their last rites. So they asked Jagatkāru to marry and to have a son who can perform the rites to free them. Vasuki offered Jagatkāru his sister, Manasa. Although Jagatkāru was abstaining from marriage he accepted. Manasa gave birth to their son, Astīka. Astīka performed the rites and freed their ancestor. Astīka also helped Nāga from a Yanja, a fire offering by stopping the king Janamejaya.
The Puranas are scriptures that tell the birth of Manasa. The story states that Sage Kashyapa was the father not Shiva. The story narrates that the serpents and reptiles created chaos on the earth. The Sage Kashyapa created Manas out of his mind (mana). The creator God Brahma made Manasa a deity of snakes and poison. Mansa then gained control over the earth by chanting mantras (prayers). Manasa then pleased Shiva, who told her to please Krishna. Because Krishna was pleased he granted her divine Siddhi powers and made her an official goddess by worshiping her ritually.
The Mangalkavyas were devotional paeans (songs) to local deities like Manasa.
Usually Manasa is worshiped without an animal. An earthen pot, a branch tree, and/or an earthen snake image is used. Manasa images are also worshiped too. She is worshiped for cure and prevention of snake bites poison. She is mostly worshiped Bengal. She is worshiped in festivals like Nag Panchami-a snake festival. She is also worshiped in Assam, a musical folk theatre that is dedicated to her myths.

Vashi Bridge

The Vashi Bridge, also called Thane Creek Bridge, is a bridge that connects the city of Mumbai to the mainland of India at Navi Mumbai. It is built across the Thane Creek. The bridge links Mankhurd in Mumbai with Vashi in Navi Mumbai, the satellite city of Mumbai. It is one of four entry points into Mumbai, and handles traffic in the region to the south and east of Mumbai.
The first bridge to connect Mumbai to Navi Mumbai was made in 1973. The bridge is 1837 metres in length and has a below-requirement 3 lane carriageway. Within two years of its opening to traffic, corrosion cracks were noticed on some parts of the bridge. This led to a series of extensive repairs. It was then decided to construct a new bridge to replace the faulty one. 
Construction on a new bridge began in 1987 and opened in 1997. The original Vashi Bridge or the 1st Thane Creek Bridge remains closed to traffic.
The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has plans to add six more lanes to the Vashi Bridge at an estimated cost of 400 crore.

Stress (biology)

Stress is a word used in biology and medicine to describe changes that can be seen in organisms. Stress can be physical or mental. Stress can describe a pressure, like the pressure of a person's upper teeth on their lower teeth while chewing. Stress can also describe an impact, when one object hits another. 
Stress describes a living thing's response to a threat or some other change in its environment. This change can be called a "stressor." Stressors can vary in size and impact. A stressor can be internal and come from inside the living thing - like an illness. A stressor can be external, coming from outside the living thing - like an attack. 
There are different types of stress. Each type has different characteristics and symptoms. 
Organisms can respond to stress in different ways.
Stress may also lead to adaptations, which allow certain organisms to better deal with the stressors. Stress happens every day, and is part of every living thing's life. Too much stress is bad and can cause health problems. Stress plays a part in some physical problems, like heart disease. Stress also plays a part in many mental illnesses, like anxiety, Acute Stress Disorder, and PTSD. Acute Stress Disorder and PTSD are mental illnesses that can happen when a person experiences something that is very terrifying, like a major accident or a war. Another type of stress disorder is a "psychosomatic illness" where a person has physical symptoms that are caused by an emotional stress, not by physical harm. 
There are different ways to deal with stress. One tip is to remove yourself from the stressor. For example if a school assignment is causing stress, taking a break from the assignment can be good. This break can include sleeping or engaging in hobbies. Physical activity and exercise reduce stress. Social support from friends and family can be helpful. Health care professionals can help when stress is bad and affects physical or mental health. Relaxing with meditation and deep breathing can also manage stress.

Hawking radiation

Hawking radiation is black body radiation which is emitted by black holes, due to quantum effects near the event horizon. It is named after the physicist Stephen Hawking, who provided a theoretical argument for its existence in 1974.
Hawking radiation reduces the mass and the energy of the black hole and is therefore also known as black hole evaporation. Because of this, black holes that lose more mass than they gain through other means are expected to shrink and ultimately vanish. Micro black holes (MBHs) are predicted to be larger net emitters of radiation than larger black holes and should shrink and dissipate faster.

Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)

Sir Alexander Mackenzie (1764-1820) was a Scottish explorer who explored the area that is now the Northwest Territories. Mackenzie was born in Stornoway, on the Scottish island of Lewis with Harris in 1764. Mackenzie made his fortune as a fur trader in northwest Canada. 
In 1789, Mackenzie left Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca with a small party of Canadians and native guides. He travelled north to Great Slave Lake on a boat or a canoe. Then he followed the river that now bears his name, the Mackenzie River. He was the first European to travel on the Mackenzie River. It took him to the Arctic Ocean. He had hoped the river would lead him to the Pacific Ocean.
In 1801 he wrote the book "Voyages on the River Saint Lawrence and Through the Continent of North America, To the Frozen and Pacific Oceans in the Years 1789 and 1793". This book contains information on native tribes and Canadian history of that time period.
He spent his last years in Scotland.

Jerusalem artichoke

The Jerusalem artichoke ("Helianthus tuberosus"), also called sunroot, sunchoke, earth apple or topinambour, is a species of sunflower native to eastern North America, and found from eastern Canada and Maine west to North Dakota, and south to northern Florida and Texas. It is also cultivated widely across the temperate zone for its tuber, which is used as a root vegetable.
The herbaceous plant is perennial. It can reach heights of up to . The leaves are oval, and grow to to wide, and to long. The plant has been imported to Europe, and it is seen as an invasive species - few animals eat it, and it will take away the space of other plants. This means that often, there is uncontrolled growth.
The plant has been used to make spirits and sugar. It is a food plant for animals such as horses and pigs. People who suffer form diabetes often use it: Up to sixteen percent of the plant is made of the polysaccharide inulin. 
In the 1980s, the Jerusalem artichoke also gained some notoriety when its seeds were planted by midwestern US farmers at the prodding of an agricultural pyramid scheme. There was little market for the tuber in that part of the US at the time, but farmers were assured it would soon appear on the commodity market. The only profits were realized by the initial distributors and the first few levels of farmers (who sold their seeds to other levels of the pyramid). As a result, many of the farms that had planted large quantities of the crop were ruined.

The Bass Highway is a highway in Tasmania, Australia. It is a part of the National Highway, named National Highway 1. It joins the major cities across the north of the state - Burnie, Devonport and Launceston. The Bass Highway is, like Bass Strait, named for explorer George Bass.
The highway connects the following towns:
From Burnie, the Bass Highway is no longer a National Highway, and connects the following towns:
As part of the National Highway, there have been many changes to the highway. In the 1980s it was made longer to join the southern exit at Launceston which connects to the Midland Highway. Almost the entire length of the highway has been re-aligned to allow for dual carriageway, overtaking lanes, and the bypass of small towns.
Between Launceston and Deloraine, this had included Carrick and Hadspen in the 1980s and Deloraine in the early 1990s. The longest stretch of highway, the Hagley-Westbury bypass, was completed in 2001. People living in the small towns have been concerned that they no longer get passing trade. The 'old' highway, now known as the Meander Valley Highway, is promoted as a tourist route.
The highway between Latrobe and Somerset has had a similar re-alignment. This section of the highway is more of a commuter highway than a tourist highway, and as such the local economy does not rely on passing tourists.

Cole's Hill is the site of the first cemetery used by the Pilgrims in Plymouth Colony. This is where they buried those who died in the winter of 1620-1621. Many were buried in secret and at night and corn was planted over their graves. This was to prevent the Native Americans from knowing how many of them had died. The hill is named after John Cole who built a house there in 1697. During the American Revolutionary War and again during the War of 1812 cannon were placed there behind earthworks to protect the town.
The hill is located on Carver Street. It is across the street from Plymouth Rock. Cole's Hill was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960.

Cracker Jack

Cracker Jack is an American brand of snack food. It is made of molasses-flavored candy-coated popcorn and peanuts. The food is packaged with a prize of very minor value inside. Some food historians consider Cracker Jack the first junk food. An early version of Cracker Jack was sold at the first Chicago World's Fair in 1893. In 1896, the first lot of Cracker Jack was made. A taster remarked, "That's crackerjack!" (meaning "of excellent quality"). It became the product name.

Neonatal diabetes mellitus

Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is a type of diabetes. It happens during the first 6 months of human life. Infants with this condition do not produce enough insulin. This causes an increase of blood sugar. NDM is often mistaken for the much more common Type 1 diabetes, although type 1 often happens after the first 6 months of life. In almost 60% of those with NDM, this condition lasts their whole life.
Symptoms of NDM include thirst, frequent urination and dehydration. Most fetuses with NDM do not grow properly in the uterus. Newborns are much smaller than most other newborns. After birth, many babies do not gain enough weight or grow as rapidly as other babies.

Rosacea

Rosacea is a chronic facial condition that is characterized through acne and redness. It can happen to people of any age. It gets worse if left untreated. There are four types of rosacea, three involving human skin and the fourth affecting eyes.
Rosacea affects mostly Caucasians, though some other races can be affected. Rosacea affects both males and females. Females are three times more likely than males to get rosacea. Things that can cause rosacea are exposure of the face to extreme temperature, the heat of sunlight, severe sunburn, stress, anxiety, alcohol and spicy foods. Most people with rosacea have only mild redness and are never officially diagnosed or treated.

Ur (supercontinent)

Ur was a supercontinent that formed 3.1 billion years ago in the early Archaean eon (during the Mesoarchaean era). It might have been the oldest continent on Earth, half a billion years older than Arctica. However, one other supercontinent, Vaalbara, may have come before Ur. Vaalbara might have formed about 3.6 billion years ago. 
Ur joined with the continents Nena and Atlantica about 1 billion years ago to form the supercontinent Rodinia. Ur survived as a single unit until it was separated when the supercontinent Pangaea broke apart into Laurasia and Gondwana.
Rocks that made up Ur are now parts of Africa, Australia, and India.
In the early period of Ur's existence, it was probably the only continent on Earth. Therefore, scientists call Ur a supercontinent, even though it was probably smaller than Australia is now. Today's New Zealand is similar to Ur, but rotated 90 degrees out of phase, and about too far south. 
When Ur was the only continent on Earth, all other land was in the form of small granite Islands and small land-masses like Vaalbara, which were not large enough to be continents.

<doc id="403086" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=403086" title="Alto Adige">
Alto Adige

Alto Adige is the Italian name of an area around the Alps from where it is originated the second main river in northern Italy: the "Adige". The history of the name indicates that the etymology comes from the river Adige, with "alto" meaning upper, because the upper part of the river flows through the province. The name was first created by the Napoleonic French to distinguish (point out difference) this Italian-speaking area from the Austrian empire's Tyrol, directly north.
The name "Alto Adige" was coined (created) in the late eighteenth century by Napoleon, when he occupied the territory of northern Italy near the Alps.
In Italy, Alto Adige currently has the full name "Provincia Autonoma di Bolzano - Alto Adige", but usually the name Alto Adige is used, since academic Ettore Tolomei made it official in Italy after the Great War.
This was the name of the French administrative division known as the "Department of Alto Adige" ("Dipartimento dell'Alto Adige"), created during Napoleon's "Kingdom of Italy" in 1810, which is related to the river Adige born in this province.
Today it is the Italian name of the part of Tyrol that was south of the Brenner Pass. Together with Trentino it forms the Italian region Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol: legally the capital is Trento, but in practice, Bolzano also has this function.
Just after WWII about sixty five percent of the population spoke German as their mother tongue, about a third spoke Italian, and about five percent spoke the Latin language. In the 2011 census the percentages were: 63%, 23% and 4% (another 10% are immigrants from outside Italy).
During French control of the region, South Tyrol was officially named "Haut Adige" to get rid of relation to the historic "County of Tyrol" of Austria.
The District of Alto Adige was created by Napoleon as part of the Dipartamento del Benaco in his Cisalpine Republic, and was near Verona. This Benaco department, created in 1797, was gotten rid of in 1798 as a result of administrative changes to the Cisalpine Republic.
Some years later, Napoleon created the Department Alto Adige further north; this department was a part of the Kingdom of Italy from 1810 to 1814.
It was created the Department of Alto Adige with the division of the Austrian Tyrol between French Bavaria and the Kingdom of Italy, and included the southern part of germanized Tyrol with the city of Bolzano with surroundings (along with the Trentino).
The boundaries were made by Austrian and German commissioners, saying that a territory would belong to the Kingdom of Italy if it is inhabited by Italians, according to the principle: "belonging to the Kingdom of Italy because inhabited by Italians" ("" ).
This shows that Bolzano was a mostly Italian town in Napoleonic times, and that in the following century was "Germanized" (as in the 1911 Austrian census, Bolzano was mostly German-speaking, at almost 91%).
Indeed between the Renaissance and the 19th century, the whole area, originally populated by Latins from the time of Roman Empire, experienced a lot of Germanization. In the centuries before Napoleon, only the Dolomite's area of the western part of the present province of Bolzano (especially the Val Venosta near Merano) remained neolatin.

Squanto

Squanto (or Tisquantum, 1580? – November 1622) was a Native American who helped the Pilgrims survive in the New World. He learned to speak English and was hired as a guide and interpreter. He taught the Pilgrims to plant corn. Squanto had much power among the Native Americans and the Pilgrims. He abused it, and barely escaped an Indian execution. He died in 1622 while making a trip around Cape Cod. 
Squanto was born about 1580 in the area of present day Plymouth, Massachusetts. He was a member of the Pawtucket people. Little is known about his early life. Squanto is thought to have been kidnapped as a young boy along the coast of Maine, and taken to England in 1605. He was taught English. He was hired as a guide and interpreter. He returned to his homeland with John Smith in 1614.
In 1614, Squanto and 23 other Indians were kidnapped by a lieutenant under Smith. This lieutenant sold some in Malaga, Spain. Spanish friars rescued the others, including Squanto. He found his way to England. He was employed by John Slaney of the Newfoundland Company, and was sent to Newfoundland in 1610, probably as an interpreter. He returned to his homeland in North America in 1619. His people had been wiped out by disease. He lived with the Wampanoag people.
In the spring of 1621, Squanto was taken to the Pilgrim settlement of Plymouth by Samoset. Samoset was an Indian who had made friends with the English settlers. Squanto was soon living with the people of Plymouth. 
He joined them in meeting with Indian tribes. He helped to keep the peace. Tradition says he taught the Pilgrims to catch eels. William Bradford wrote that Squanto was of great help in the first year's spring planting of corn. He showed the Pilgrims both how to plant it and how to tend it. He showed them how to use fish as a fertilizer.
Squanto's power went to his head. He made some shady deals with both the Pilgrims and the Indians. He was found out, and barely escaped an Indian execution.
In November 1622, Squanto fell ill with a fever while on a trip around Cape Cod with William Bradford. He may have been poisoned by the Wampanoag. He bled at the nose, and said it was a certain sign of death. He asked Bradford to pray to the Christian god so he might enter Heaven. He gave some gifts to others. He died a few days later in what is now Chatham, Massachusetts.

On November 3, 1998, Paul Cellucci was elected as Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, narrowly defeating Democratic attorney general Scott Harshbarger. He had successfully fought off a challenge from State Treasurer Joe Malone in the September primary. He was sworn in as the 69th Governor of Massachusetts on January 7, 1999.
On April 10, 2001, Cellucci resigned to become U.S. Ambassador to Canada, being appointed by President George W. Bush. This made him the second consecutive Massachusetts governor to resign in order to assume an ambassadorship: his predecessor William Weld resigned after being nominated to be Ambassador to Mexico by President Bill Clinton. (Weld was never confirmed by the United States Senate, however, and hence never served as Ambassador.)
In 2008, Cellucci has said that after thirty-five years in public service he had no intention of seeking further office, and that while he had no interest in serving as Vice President, he did not exclusively rule it out. He supported John McCain's candidacy for president in 2008.

Sacrifice

A sacrifice is giving something up. In many religions, it usually is about giving something to God or gods. Many Pagan peoples made human sacrifices and animal sacrifices. The Greek play "Iphigenia" by Euripides contains an example of this. In the Old Testament, Jewish people followed the laws about animal sacrifices in the book of Leviticus. Cows and pigeons were killed to make atonement with God. In the New Testament, Christ's death on the cross is seen as substitutionary atonement for sin.

Kaufman was born on January 17, 1949 in New York City, New York to a Jewish family. He was raised in Great Neck, Long Island, New York. Kaufman studied at Grahm Junior College. He was never married and had no children. 
Kaufman died on May 16, 1984 in West Hollywood, California from a rare case of lung cancer, aged 35. He was buried at Beth David Cemetery, Elmont, New York.
Kaufman allegedly told many people—including Bob Zmuda—that he wished to fake his own death. This had caused some fans to believe Kaufman was still alive when he died. Kaufman himself said that if he were to fake his death, he would return 20 years later, which would have been in 2004. Many of Kaufman's fans saw a picture that looks similar to that of Andy. 
There is a website related to this theory, and, recently, "a grainy video has surfaced that purports to show Kaufman living under an assumed name in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Hurricane Edouard (1996)

Hurricane Edouard was the strongest hurricane in 1996. Its winds reached 145 miles an hour. Edouard was at major hurricane status for around eight days. The storm was originally forecast to slam the Northeastern United States, but it was much less severe there. Edouard generated strong waves that killed two people on the coastal shore of New Jersey. The southeast coast of Massachusetts received minor hurricane force winds that caused minimal damage on Nantucket Island. The name Edouard was not retired due to lack of serious damage. The name was used again in the 2002 and 2008 hurricane seasons, and will be again during 2014.

32 fouettés en tournant

32 fouettés en tournant is a movement in classical ballet. It is 32 "fouettés en tournant" performed without stopping.
One "fouetté rond de jambe en tournant" is an action where the dancer stands for a moment on flat foot with the supporting knee bent as the other "working" leg is whipped around to the side, creating the impetus to spin one turn. The working leg is then pulled in to touch the supporting knee as the dancer rises up "en pointe" on the supporting foot. 
32 fouettés were first performed by Pierina Legnani in Marius Petipa's "Cinderella" in 1893.
Konstantin Skalkovsky, the dance critic for the "St. Petersburg Gazette", went to the first performance of "Cinderella". He reported that "...in the last act Legnani positively outdid herself. When Emma Bessone danced the lead in "The Haarlem Tulip" she did 14 fouettés. In her variation Legnani performed 32 of them without stopping, and without travelling one inch! The public delightedly applauded the Ballerina and compelled her to repeat this variation as well. On the repetition she nevertheless did 28 fouettés. To count them became the favourite occupation of the public."
Legnani repeated this feat again in many other ballets during her career. She performed them as Odile in the "Black Swan Pas de Deux" from "Swan Lake" (1895).

Autism rights movement

The autism rights movement is a social movement that wants changes for autistic people and their caregivers. It wants the autism spectrum to be accepted by society as just a difference in ability to function in daily life. It does not believe autism is a mental disorder that needs to be cured.
The autism rights movement is sometimes controversial. It argues against the belief that most people with autism have low intelligence. Some people in the movement do not agree that this is true. There is fear that professionals, such as social workers, may try to prevent autistics from being married or having children. Also, people in the movement say that autistic people should not be treated differently from anyone else.
The movement has a variety of goals:
Autism rights activists are sometimes called neurodiversity activists. Neurodiversity is a word for how everyone's brains are different. Autistic people have different brains to people who do not have autism. People who do not have autism are called neurotypical people. The word 'neurodiversity' is preferred to 'autism' because it is not saying that autism is a medical condition. 'Neurotypical' is said instead of 'normal' because people think that normal means better.

Oral cancer

Oral cancer is cancer of any part of the mouth. It can start in the mouth, lips, or the oropharynx (the part of the throat at the back of the mouth).
A person can get oral cancer without having any other type of cancer. However, oral cancer can also happen because of "metastasis". This means that the person had cancer in some other part of their body, and it spread to the mouth. The person's cancer may be far away from the mouth, or it may be in a part of the body that neighbors the mouth. For example, if a person has cancer of the nasal cavity, the cancer can spread to the mouth.
There are a few different types of oral cancers. But about 90% (9 in every 10 cases) are a type called squamous cell carcinomas. Squamous cells make up the main part of the outer layer of the skin. These cells line the lips, mouth, and throat. A "carcinoma" is a type of cancer that can start in these cells in the skin.
Squamous cell carcinomas most often start in the tongue. But they can also start in any other part of the mouth, including the floor of the mouth (under the tongue); the inside lining of the cheek; the gums; the lips; or the palate (the roof of the mouth).
Other oral cancers include:

Water scarcity

Water scarcity is a lack of drinkable water available in a given area. It mostly affects arid and deserted areas, and places where the water is too polluted to drink. It is a social, environmental and economic problem in many countries. Water scarcity can be the result of both human and natural causes. Changes in climate and weather patterns can cause the availability of water to drop. Common human causes include over-consumption, bad governance, pollution, and increases in the demand for water.
Different terms are used to describe different types of water scarcity:
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that by 2025, 1.9 billion people will be living in countries or regions with total water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions. The World Bank has said that climate change could heavily change the future of water availability and use, and therefore increase water stress on a global scale.
Water scarcity has negative affects on ecology, biodiversity, agriculture and human health. It has also led to armed conflicts in several cases.

He further wrote that the movie was "so ruthless in its exploitation of Miss Temple's great talent for infant charm that it seldom succeeds in being properly lively and gay". He finished his review noting the audience applauded for a full eleven seconds after the final fade-out, and that the movie "ought to bring out the best in every one who sees it."

The Little Princess

The Little Princess is a 1939 movie. It was directed by Walter Lang. It stars Shirley Temple. It is loosely based on the book "A Little Princess" by Frances Hodgson Burnett. It was the first Shirley Temple movie to be filmed completely in Technicolor. It was also her last major success as a child star.
Captain Crewe is called to fight in the Second Boer War. He leaves his daughter Sara at Miss Minchin's School for Girls. One day, his lawyer arrives in the school with news that Captain Crewe has died and his real estate has been confiscated. Sara is now a poor orphan. She becomes a servant in the school. Sara tires of her servant duties. She sneaks off to Veterans Hospital, convinced her father is not dead. She finds him wounded. They reunite joyfully.
According to "Variety", "Transposition of the Frances Hodgson Burnett several-generation favorite, Sara Crewe, is accomplished most successfully. The fairy-tale story is still saccharine to the nth degree, but once the basic premise is established, it rolls along acceptably. And, while the story has been changed for screen purposes, the general line is close enough."
Benjamin R. Crisler reviewed the film when it opened in New York City at the Roxy Theatre. He wrote, "With any other child on earth, it is amazing to reflect, "The Little Princess" would stand out as one of the most glaring exhibits of pure hokum in screen history; with Mistress Temple, it may very well be, as Mr. Zanuck unflinchingly proclaims, the greatest picture with which Mr. Zanuck has ever been associated."
Janet Maslin, writing for "The New York Times" 44 years later, called it "antiquated enough to seem charming" and concludes "[t]he movie's music, its corny but likable histrionics and its rousing patriotism (it was made in 1939) culminate in a happy ending sure to make even grown-up viewers cry."

Gouache

Gouache, also spelled guache, is a type of paint. It is also commonly called poster paint. It consists of pigment, a binding agent (usually gum arabic), and some additives to make it opaque. An inert, white pigment such as chalk is usually added. The essential idea is that gouache covers up whatever is underneath. Water colours, in contrast, are somewhat transparent. 
The fast-drying quality of gouache makes it a favourite for "en plein air" (outdoor) paintings. It was also a favourite of J.M.W. Turner. 
Gouache also refers to paintings that use this type of paint.

Acrylic paint

Acrylic paint is a fast-drying paint containing pigment in an acrylic polymer emulsion. Acrylic paints can be diluted with water, but are water-resistant when dry. Depending on how much the paint is diluted (with water) or modified with acrylic gels, media, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a watercolor or an oil painting, or have its own unique appearance.
Acrylic paint can give a much brighter, more vivid colour than oil paints. It has been much used in modern art, and is cheaper than oil paint, which is rather an expensive material. When dry, acrylic paint usually cannot be removed from a solid surface. 
In 1934, a German chemical company created acrylic resin. It was first used in the 1940s. Acrylics were commercially available as paint for artists in the 1950s. Later, many advances were made to acrylic paint as more and more people began using it.

ʻIolani Palace

Iolani Palace is a building in downtown Honolulu, Hawaii, United States. It was a palace for the kings and queens of Hawaii. It is the only palace in the United States that was used as an official residence by a reigning monarch. Two monarchs governed from Iolani Palace. They were King Kalākaua and Queen Liliuokalani. After Hawaii stopped having kings and queens in 1893, the building was used as the state's capitol building until 1969.
In 1962, Iolani Palace became a National Historic Landmark. The palace was restored and opened to the public as a museum in 1978.
Iolani Palace was built when the king of Hawaii was David Kalākaua. Kalākaua had seen royal palaces in Europe. He had Iolani Palace designed to be like those. It was built of brick and concrete. The building was completed in November 1882. It cost over $340,000. It measures about . It is two stories high. It has a basement. It has four corner towers. It has two towers in the center that are high.
Iolani Palace is the only building of its architectural style. The style is called "American Florentine". The palace had electricity and telephones even before the White House had them.
After Hawaii stopped having kings and queens in 1893, the new government of Hawaii took over Iolani Palace. The palace was renamed the "Executive Building" for the Republic of Hawaii. Officials made a record of what was in the building. The things that could not be used by the new government were sold at public auctions.
Queen Liliuokalani was imprisoned for nine months in a small room on the upper floor after a rebellion in 1895. The quilt she made is still there.
In 1930, the inside of Iolani Palace was remodeled. The wood framing was replaced by steel and reinforced concrete. In 1935, the name was changed back to Iolani Palace.
Iolani Palace was made an official National Historic Landmark on December 29, 1962. On October 15, 1966, it was added as site 66000293 to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Oahu. Government offices left the Palace in 1969 and moved to the new Hawaii State Capitol building.
Many things that used to be in the palace have been returned. Money from the government and private donations paid to help make rooms in the palace look like they did during the monarchy era. Iolani Palace opened to the public in 1978. In the basement is a photographic display of the Palace, the Hawaiian crown jewels, awards given by the monarchs, and regalia worn by the high chiefs of the islands.
The grounds of Iolani Palace are managed by the Hawaii State Department of Land and Natural Resources. The palace building itself is managed as a historical house museum by the Friends of Iolani Palace, a non-profit non-governmental organization. The birthdays of King Kalākaua (November 16) and Queen Kapiolani (December 28) are celebrated with ceremonies.

Gesso

Gesso is a primer or foundation for art painting on wood or canvas. It is a white paint mixture. It has a binder mixed with a pigment. Traditionally, the binder is glue or gelatin, the pigment is chalk, plaster or gypsum. 
Gesso is used in art to prepare a surfaces (wood panels, canvas and sculpture) for painting. Paint and/or other materials are applied on top of the gesso. One reason for covering the surface with gesso is that wood or canvas has a rough or uneven surface, and a colour. Gesso "priming" lets the artist's chosen subject show more clearly than it would otherwise. 
Even if a surface has no roughness, many artists still prime it before starting the painting proper, though they might use a paint or "wash" of their own choosing. They do this because the primer, though it cannot be seen directly, may change and help the quality of light reflected from the surface. Gesso, however, is specially useful for a rough or uneven surface. 
Acrylic gesso, a widely used "ground", is a modern version which is cheaper and easier to use than the traditional type of gesso. It is a combination of calcium carbonate with an acrylic polymer medium latex, a pigment and other chemicals to ensure flexibility and increase life. It is technically not "gesso" at all.</sup>
"The Painter's Handbook" notes a problem with using oil paints over an acrylic gesso ground instead of a traditional oil ground, citing a mismatch in flexibility over time that could cause the oil paint to delaminate (flake off).

Contrail

A contrail (condensation trail) is a cloud-like trail of water vapor or ice crystals left by an airplane. When jet fuel burns, it produces water vapor and carbon dioxide. The water vapor condenses (turns from gas to liquid) because of the low temperature at the high altitude that the plane is flying. The chemtrail conspiracy theory claims that these trails may contain harmful chemicals being sprayed by government organizations.

Archimedes' screw

Archimedes' screw is a machine. It is a type of pump used for raising water up. It is a screw inside a fairly tight-fitting cylinder. With the bottom end in water, the screw lifts water up to the top, where it pours out of a spout. The screw can be turned by hand, or by a windmill, or by an engine. The screw is often used for filling irrigation ditches. 
Archimedes wrote about it when he was in Alexandria, Egypt. It is not known for certain whether he did invent it, but it is always attributed to him. The Archimedes screw is still much in use all over the world. 
There is also a kind of reverse Archimedes' screw. Water poured in on top turns the screw. The turning drives an electric generator, which makes electricity. It is good for rivers with modest water drops ('low heads'). The reverse screw has the same benefits as using the screw for pumping: it can handle very dirty water and widely varying rates of flow, with high efficiency.

Ezra

Ezra (; , "Ezra"; fl. 480–440 BC), is a highly respected figure in Judaism.
He is called Ezra the Scribe (, "Ezra ha-Sofer") and Ezra the Priest in the Book of Ezra. In an early Greek translation of the bible, the Septuagint, the name is written as "Esdras" (), from which comes . His name may be an abbreviation of "", "God-helps".
In Islam he is known as Uzair (). He was mentioned in the Qur'an.
The "Book of Ezra" and "Book of Nehemiah" are the oldest sources for the history of Ezra. Many of the other books they say are written by Ezra (First Esdras, 3-6 Ezra) are written after that. Those books take the story from the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.
Ezra was a member of the family of Seraiah the high priest. He lived in Babylon when in the seventh year (~ 457 BCE) of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, the king sent him to Jerusalem to teach the laws of God to any who did not know them.
Ezra led a large group of exiles back to Jerusalem. He discovered that Jewish men had been marrying non-Jewish women. He worked to stop this from happening again.
Some years later the king Artaxerxes sent a Jewish nobleman, Nehemiah, to Jerusalem. He had to rebuild the city walls. Once this was done, Nehemiah asked Ezra to read the Law of Moses (the Torah) to the people. The people and priests agreed to keep to this law and to separate themselves from all other peoples.
The second book of Esdras was written a lot later, c. AD 100. In this book, Ezra talks with an angel or God three times and has four visions. At the end, he is taken up to heaven like Enoch and Elijah. Ezra is seen as a new Moses in this book.
Judaism believes Ezra started the Great Assembly of scholars and prophets. Later, this would become the Sanhedrin, the authority when it comes to religious law.
It is said that Ezra was the writer of the Books of Chronicles.
His tomb at Al-ʻUzair on the banks of the Tigris near Basra, Iraq, is a pilgrimage site for the local Marsh Arabs.

Turkana boy

Turkana boy, or Nariokotome boy, is the fossil KNM-WT 15000. It is a nearly complete skeleton of a hominid who died in the early Pleistocene 1.5 million years ago (mya). This specimen is the "most complete early human skeleton ever found". It was first classified as "Homo erectus"; after much heated debate, it was re-classified as "Homo ergaster". 
His age at death has been estimated from 7 years six months to as old as 15 years. The most recent scientific review suggests 8 years of age. It was first thought that he would have grown to 1.85 m tall, but recently a height of 1.63 m was proposed. Research showed that his growth differed from that of modern humans: he would have had a shorter and smaller adolescent growth spurt.
The skeleton was discovered in 1984 by Kamoya Kimeu, a member of a team led by Richard Leakey, at Nariokotome near Lake Turkana in Kenya.
The shape of the pelvis identifies that the specimen was a male. His estimated age at death depends upon whether the maturity stage of his teeth or skeletal is used, and whether that maturity is compared to that of modern humans or chimpanzees. 
A key factor here is that while modern humans have a marked adolescent growth spurt, chimpanzees do not. While initial research assumed a modern human type of growth, more recent evidence from other fossils suggests this was less present in early "Homo". This affects the estimation of both his age and his likely stature as a fully grown adult.
The pelvis is narrower than in "Homo sapiens", which might indicate more efficient running, whether to run down small game or to avoid predators. The Boy was relatively tall, which would have increased his surface area and helped him to lose heat.
Body hair may also have been thinner to hasten cooling. Body hair was lost in the shift towards savanna living. In equatorial Africa, modern humans evolved this trait an estimated one million years ago.
The skeleton still had features (such as a low sloping forehead, strong brow ridges, and the absence of a chin) not seen in "H. sapiens". The arms were slightly longer. Turkana Boy had a projecting nose rather than the open flat nose seen in apes.

Raindrop Prelude

The Prelude Op. 28, No. 15, by Frédéric Chopin is known as the "Raindrop" prelude. It is one of the 24 Chopin preludes. This is the longest of the preludes. It lasts between five and seven minutes. The prelude is famous for its repeating A-flat. This note appears throughout the piece. It sounds like raindrops to many listeners. It is known for it's repetitive raindrop motif.
Some of the Preludes were written during Chopin and George Sand's stay at a monastery in Valldemossa, Majorca in 1838. In her "Histoire de ma vie", Sand told how one evening she and her son Maurice, returning from Palma, Majorca, in a terrible rainstorm, found a frantic Chopin who cried, "Ah! I knew well that you were dead." While playing his piano he had a dream:
"He saw himself drowned in a lake. Heavy drops of icy water fell in a regular rhythm on his breast, and when I made him listen to the sound of the drops of water indeed falling in rhythm on the roof, he denied having heard it. He was even angry that I should interpret this in terms of imitative sounds. He protested with all his might – and he was right to – against the childishness of such aural imitations. His genius was filled with the mysterious sounds of nature, but transformed into sublime equivalents in musical thought, and not through slavish imitation of the actual external sounds."
Sand did not say which prelude Chopin played for her at that time. Most music critics think it was no. 15, because of the repeating A flat, with its suggestion of the "gentle patter" of rain. Peter Dayan points out that Sand accepted Chopin's protests that the prelude was not an "imitation" of the sound of raindrops, but a "translation" of nature's harmonies within Chopin's "génie". Frederick Niecks says that the prelude "rises before one's mind the cloistered court of the monastery of Valdemosa, and a procession of monks chanting lugubrious prayers, and carrying in the dark hours of night their departed brother to his last resting-place.
The prelude opens with a "serene" theme in D flat. It then changes to a "lugubrious interlude" in C sharp minor, "with the dominant pedal never ceasing, a basso ostinato". The repeating A flat, which has been heard throughout the first section, here becomes more insistent. Following this, the prelude ends with a repetition of the original theme. Niecks says, "This C sharp minor portion...affects one like an oppressive dream; the re-entrance of the opening D flat major, which dispels the dreadful nightmare, comes upon one with the smiling freshness of dear, familiar nature – only after these horrors of the imagination can its serene beauty be fully appreciated.

GSSP

A GSSP, more fully a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point, is an internationally agreed point which defines the start of a stage on the geologic time scale.
The work is done by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, a part of the International Union of Geological Sciences. As of 2012, 64 of the 101 stages that need a GSSP have been decided.
A geologic section has to follow the rules to be adapted as a GSSP by the ICS. The list below are the rules:
This list shows some of the GSSPs.
Because defining a GSSP depends on finding well-preserved geologic sections and identifying key events, this task becomes more harder as one goes farther back in time. Before 640 million years ago, boundaries on the geologic timescale are defined simply by reference to fixed dates, known as "Global Standard Stratigraphic Ages". The oldest GSSP is the one that marks the start of the Ediacaran at 635 million years ago.

Neurodiversity

Neurodiversity is an approach to disability and learning which would indicate that different neurological conditions appear from normal variations of human genomes. The term "neurodiversity" began being used in the extremely late 1990s as a challenge to the current views of neurological diversity and focus as being inherently pathological. Furthermore, the term would assert that neurological difference should be recognized and represented as a social category along with gender, human race, sexual orientations and disability status. Examples of these differences include (though are not limited to) autism spectrum conditions, Tourette syndrome, dyslexia, and more.

Gravitational field

In physics, a gravitational field is a model used to explain the influence that a massive body has. The influence extends into the space around itself, producing a force on another massive body. Thus, a gravitational field is used to explain gravitational phenomena (effects). It is measured in newtons per kilogram (N/kg). 
In the original Newtonian concept, gravity was a force between point masses. Following Newton, Laplace attempted to model gravity as some kind of radiation field or fluid. Since the 19th century explanations for gravity have in terms of a field model, rather than a point attraction. This revolution was brought about by Einstein's general theory of relativity. Most scientists believe that the gravitational field and its gravitational waves are the physical interpretations of Einstein's equations of general relativity.
In a field model, rather than two particles attracting each other, the mass of objects distort spacetime. This distortion is what is perceived and measured as a "force". In such a model matter moves in certain ways in response to the curvature of spacetime. One can say either "there is no gravitational force", or that "gravity is a fictitious force".

Environmental economics is a domain of economics that looks at problems of the environment from an economical perspective. Natural resources, such as clean water are limited, because of pollution. They are also seen as "free" public goods. This means that if there are no rules on how to use these goods, they will be used too much. There are externalities for using these goods, and there is the problem of free riders. In this perspective, the solution is to convert these resources into economic goods, which are integrated in the market. This will lessen the problem of free-riding, and give incentives to use these goods sparingly. An example for this is a tax which is tied to pollution." 'Proper legislation and observation of property right on how to regulate the use of these public goods is also another important factor in ensuring that market inefficiencies don't result.

<doc id="403798" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=403798" title="Free rider problem">
Free rider problem

In economics, the term free rider refers to someone who benefits from resources, goods, or services without paying for the cost of the benefit. The term "free rider" was first used in economic theory of public goods, but similar concepts have been applied in to other contexts, such as collective bargaining, antitrust law, psychology and political science. Free riding may be considered as a free rider problem when it leads to under-provision of goods or services, or when it leads to overuse or degradation of a common property resource. 
Although the term originated in economic theory, similar concepts have been cited in political science, social psychology, and other disciplines. Some individuals in a team or community may reduce their contributions or performance if they believe that one or more other members of the group may free ride.

Bangladesh–Russia relations

Relations between Bangladesh and Russia. Russia has an embassy in Dhaka and Bangladesh has an embassy in Moscow. Diplomatic relations were established on 25 January 1972, when Russia was the Soviet Union.
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has visited Russia twice to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The first time was in 2009 and then in 2013.
Relations between the Soviet Union and Bangladesh were good in the years immediately after Bangladesh's independence in 1971. The Soviet Union supported Indian actions in aiding the war of liberation, and after the war the Soviet Navy sent a floating workshop to Bangladesh for clearing Pakistani mines from the Chittagong and Chalna harbors. Mujib visited Moscow in 1972, and high-level officials from both countries made numerous reciprocal visits until 1975. The Soviets supported the socialist programs of the Mujib government and its very exceptionally close ties with India. Early Soviet aid was limited, however. During the first four months of its existence, Bangladesh received economic aid worth US$142 million from India, but only US$6 million from the Soviet Union.
It also believed that the Communist Party of Bangladesh was funded and supported in the erstwhile volatile region of the former "East Pakistan" since then it was part of a United Pakistan itself allied with the United States and the China which were hostile towards rival Soviet Union, the party itself was based on the idealogical principals of Marxism.
Bangladeshi-Soviet relations rapidly improved in 1984 and regained a level of cordiality in the mid- and late 1980s. In 1985 the Soviet Cultural Centre reopened in Dhaka. In 1986 a Soviet special envoy visited Dhaka, and later the Bangladeshi foreign minister visited Moscow. Although Soviet aid to Bangladesh was still small compared with assistance from Japan, the United States, or even China, by 1987 Bangladesh had entered into sixteen different economic accords with the Soviet Union. Soviet assistance has concentrated on the energy sector, especially several power plants at Ghorasal, near Dhaka.

The White Guard

The White Guard () is a novel by 20th century Russian writer Mikhail Bulgakov, whose later work "The Master and Margarita" brought him posthumous fame.
"The White Guard" first appeared in serial form in the Soviet-era literary journal "Rossiya" in 1925, but the magazine was closed down before the serial was completed. It was not reprinted in Russia until 1966.
After the first two parts of "The White Guard" were published in "Rossiya", Bulgakov was invited to write a version for the stage. He called the play "The Days of the Turbins." This was produced at the Moscow Art Theatre, to great acclaim:
In fact, the play completely overshadowed the book, which was in any event virtually unobtainable in any form. 
Since Bulgakov was refused permission to publish his most important works, he pleaded with Stalin to be allowed to leave the country. Stalin personally arranged for a job for him at the Moscow Arts Theatre. Bulgakov was still writing and re-writing his uncompleted novel, "The Master And Margarita", when he died in 1940. 
His widow had "The White Guard" published in large part in the literary journal "Moskva" in 1966, at the end of the Krushchev era. This was the basis for the English translation by Michael Glenny published in 1971 (New York: McGraw-Hill; London: Collins; reissued 2005 by Academy Chicago Publishers. This lacks the dream flashback sections. In 2008 Yale University Press published a translation by Marian Schwartz of the complete novel, an edition which won an award.
Set in the Ukraine, beginning in late 1918, the novel concerns the fate of the Turbin family as the various armies of the Russian Civil War the Whites, the Reds, the Imperial German Army, and Ukrainian nationalists – fight over the city of Kiev. Historical figures such as Petlyura and Pavlo Skoropadsky appear as the Turbin family is caught up in the effects of the October Revolution.
The novel contains many autobiographical elements. Bulgakov gave the younger Turbin brother some of the characteristics of his own younger brother. The description of the house of the Turbins is that of the house of the Bulgakov family in Kiev. (Today it is preserved and operated as the Mikhail Bulgakov Museum).

Dora Baltea or Doire Baltée ( or "Duria Bautica"; Valdôtain dialect: "Djouire"; Piemontes: "Deura Bàotia"), is a river in northern Italy. It is a left-hand tributary of the Po River, and is about long.
Dora Baltea is formed on the Mont Blanc by the confluence, near Entrèves, of two small rivers: Dora di Ferret, that comes from the Pré de Bar Glacier in Val Ferret; and Dora di Veny, that comes from the Miage Glacier in Val Veny.
As it crosses the Aosta Valley, the Dora Baltea flows through the city of Aosta (where the Buthier, a small river, runs into it) and near all the main cities of the lower Aosta Valley: Châtillon, Saint-Vincent, Verrès and Pont-Saint-Martin. After it enters the Piedmont region, it passes through the city of Ivrea and a good part of Canavese, gets from its right hand the waters of the Chiusella and reaches the Po at Crescentino.
The watershed has an area of , and its discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) is 96 cubic metres per second when it gets to the Po river.
The main tributaries of the Dora Baltea are (beginning at the source):
The mean monthly discharges (in m³) for the years 1951-1991 in the confluence with the Po river were:
Dora Baltea is a popular place for the practice of sports like canoeing, kayaking and similar water sports.

Blohm &amp; Voss Bv 142

The Blohm & Voss Bv 142 was a German reconnaissance aircraft of World War II. Its maiden flight was in October 1938. It was built at the beginning like an airliner. But just one was used by Lufthansa. The others were used by Luftwaffe for far reconnaissance. Fragile and unwieldy it was stopped in 1942, just two years after it commissioned. Only four examples were built.

Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction

The Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction (often shortened to "BZR" or "BZ") is an example of a chemical oscillator. It is often used to illustrate a chaotic system. The BZR is made of several chemical reactions, that occur in sequence. It shows chemical oscillation, which is unusual for chemical reactions. At first it was thought to be a measurement error, or an artifact. It was thought that according to the Second law of thermodynamics, this should not occur. According to this law, a system that is in an unordered state will not assume an ordered state on its own, that is without the provision of energy. However, this is only applicable in a closed system, and does not apply to the BZ reaction.
The reactions are theoretically important because they show that chemical reactions do not have to be dominated by equilibrium thermodynamic behavior. These reactions are far from equilibrium and remain so for a significant length of time. In this sense, they provide an interesting chemical model of nonequilibrium biological phenomena. The mathematical models of the BZ reactions themselves are of theoretical interest.
An essential aspect of the BZ reaction is called"excitability": under the influence of stimuli, patterns develop in what would otherwise be a perfectly calm medium. Some clock reactions such as Briggs–Rauscher and BZ using the tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride as catalyst can be made to show self-organising activity through the influence of light.
Similar processes were already known in the 19th century. Wilhelm Ostwald gave a detailed account in 1899 and 1900, describing the oscillations of Chrome in Hydrochloric acid and of iron in Nitric acid. Boris Pavlovich Belousov accidentally discovered the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction in the 1950s. Ilya Prigogine was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977. His research focused on systems which were far away from an equilibrium state, the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction was included. Beloussow was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1980, after his death. The Lenin prize was the highest distinction for scientific achievement in the Soviet Union.

Anggun Cipta Sasmi ( [aŋˈɡun ˈt͡ʃipta ˈsasmi]; born 29 April 1974) is an Indonesian and French-naturalised singer-songwriter. Born in Jakarta, she began performing at the age of seven and recorded a children's album two years later. With the help of famed Indonesian producer Ian Antono, in 1986 Anggun released her first rock-influenced studio album, "Dunia Aku Punya". She became further well known with the single "Mimpi" (1989), which was listed as one of the 150 Greatest Indonesian Songs of All Time by "Rolling Stone". She followed it with a series of singles and three more studio albums, which established her as one of the most prominent Indonesian rock stars of the early 1990s.
Anggun left Indonesia in 1994 to pursue an international career. After two years struggling in London and Paris, Anggun met French producer Erick Benzi and signed to Sony Music Entertainment. Her first international album, "Snow on the Sahara" (1997), was released in 33 countries and became the best-selling album by an Asian artist outside Asia. The album spawned her signature hit "Snow on the Sahara", which reached number one in several countries. Since her international breakthrough, Anggun has released five English-language studio albums and six French-language studio albums, as well as a soundtrack album to the Danish film "Open Hearts" (2002). She represented France in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku, Azerbaijan, with the song "Echo (You and I)". She joined the judging panel of talent shows "X Factor Indonesia" (2013) and "Asia's Got Talent" (2015); the former made her the highest-paid judge in Indonesian television history.
Anggun is the Asian artist with the highest album sales outside Asia, with her releases being certified gold and platinum in some European countries. She is the first Indonesian artist to have success in European and American record charts. She has received a number of accolades for her achievements, including the Chevalier des Arts et Lettres from the Government of France and the World Music Award for World's Best-Selling Indonesian Artist. Aside from her musical career, Anggun has been involved in numerous environmental and humanitarian works. She has been appointed as the global ambassador of the United Nations twice, first for the International Year of Microcredit in 2005 and then for the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 2009 onwards.

Samuel Fuller

Samuel Fuller (1580 - 1633) was a passenger on the 1620 voyage of the Pilgrim ship "Mayflower" and singed the Mayflower Compact. He became a respected church deacon and the physician for Plymouth Colony.
Fuller was a son of Robert Fuller, a butcher. He was baptized on January 20, 1580 at Redenhall, co. Norfolk, England. He was a member of the Separatist religion which was not allowed in England.
In 1610, Fuller moved to Leiden, Netherlands. He was a friend of Degory Priest and Sarah Allerton. Sarah was the sister of Isaac Allerton. Fuller was an active church congregation member. In Leiden records Fuller was referred to as “a serge worker of London.” 
Samuel’s wife and son died in 1615 and he married Bridget Lee.
Samuel Fuller helped to plan for the Separatists to move to the Colony of Virginia. They made an agreement with the Virginia Company. Fuller, along with Edward Winslow, William Bradford and Isaac Allerton, sent a letter on June 10, 1620 to John Carver and Robert Cushman. These men were in London and were also making plans for the voyage. They learned that Thomas Weston and the Company had changed the agreement. One of the changes was that the merchants would keep half of the houses and lands. The pilgrims would also have one day off from work per week. These problems were not solved until Robert Cushman arrived in the "Fortune" in November 1621.
Samuel Fuller learned about medicine before he traveled to the New World so that he could help the others if needed. There would be no doctor on the "Mayflower" or at Plymouth Colony.
Samuel Fuller boarded the "Mayflower" with only his servant William Butten, leaving his wife behind in Leiden until he could get settled. William Butten died before the "Mayflower" landed.
The Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" spotted land. They landed on 21 November and wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in the Colony of Virginia, but the ship was damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.
Samuel's wife came on the ship "Anne" and in a few years Samuel would receive two acres of Land. His wife Bridget received one acre of land near a pond. In 1627, Samuel and his wife received several livestock for their farm.
In 1629, a group of people arrived led by John Endicott. They became sick and Fuller was sent to assist them. Endicott sent a letter of thanks to William Bradford. He also helped people at Charleston when they were sick.
Not everyone thought Fuller was a good doctor. In 1637, Thomas Morton, wrote a letter calling Fuller a quacksalver which is where the word "quack" comes from. 
In the summer of 1633, Fuller fell ill with a sickness that had spread through Plymouth. Author Nathaniel Morton wrote about Samuel Fuller’s in his 1669 New England’s Memorial. He praised Fuller and his work.
Fuller was married two times. He married Sarah Dunthorne who died in England in 1584. His second wife was Bridget Lee who died in 1667. He and Bridget had four children: Mercy and Samuel, Jr., unknown female and Elizabeth.
Samuel Fuller made out his will in 1633. He said he was sick and weak. Samuel Fuller died in 1633.
The burial place of Samuel Fuller is unknown.

Airbus A300

The Airbus A300 is a jet airliner which was made by Airbus. Airbus Industries launched the plane in 1972, and it was the first plane with two engines to have more than one row of seats (the first twin-engined wide-body aircraft). The A300 can hold 266 passengers in two classes. It can fly for a maximum of when it is full, but this depends on the type of A300.
Air France was the first airline to get an A300. Air France began to use its A300s on 30 May 1974. Airbus stopped making A300s in July 2007. When Airbus stopped making A300s, it also stopped making A310s. The freighter version of the A300 has been replaced by the A330-200F.
In 1966, Frank Kolk, a member of American Airlines, asked for a plane to replace the Boeing 727. He wanted a plane which could hold 250 to 300 passengers, with two engines. American plane makers made planes with three engines, like the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar, because the FAA had banned planes with two engines from flying on certain routes.
In September 1967, the British, French, and German governments agreed to begin designing the Airbus A300, which would have 300 seats. 
After this agreement, both the French and British governments were worried about the plane. The plane needed a new type of engine from Rolls-Royce, the RB207. In December 1968, the French and British companies (Sud Aviation and Hawker Siddeley) thought of a different design: the Airbus A250, which would have 250 seats. This design had its name changed to the A300B, and it did not need a new type of engine, which saved money. To get more U.S. airlines to buy the plane, American General Electric CF6-50 engines were used for the A300 instead of Rolls-Royce engines. The British government was upset and decided to stop supporting the A300. However, Hawker-Siddeley did not leave, and designed the wings for the A300.
In 1972, the A300 flew for the first time. The first type of A300 to be made, the A300B2, began to be used by airlines in 1974. The A300B4 began to be used one year later. At first, Airbus Industrie did not sell many planes. However, by 1979, 81 aircraft were being used. It was the A320 which made Airbus the very big company that it is today.
Parts of the A300 were made by many different companies from all over Europe. These were taken to Toulouse-Blagnac by some Aero Spacelines Super Guppy aircraft so that the parts could all be put together to make the plane. This method turned out to be much better than simply building the aircraft in one place.
Some of the technology used for the Airbus A300 was taken from Concorde. When it began being used in 1974, the A300 was an advanced plane. Some advanced features were:
A300s made later have other features, like:
The A300 did not sell very well at first. Most of the orders were from airlines of countries which made up Airbus Industrie, like Air France and Lufthansa.
In 1974, Korean Air ordered 4 A300s. This made it the first airline outside of Europe to order an Airbus Industrie plane. Airbus Industrie thought that South-East-Asia was a good place to sell planes. It also thought that Korean Air was the 'key' to selling planes in that area.
Airlines which used the A300 to fly on short flights needed to have fewer flights so that the aircraft could be filled, so these airlines lost customers to other airlines which used smaller aircraft and had flights more often. Eventually, Airbus had to make the A320 to rival the Boeing 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9/MD-80. 
In 1977, Eastern Air Lines leased four A300s. Frank Borman, who was the CEO of Eastern, was happy that the A300 used much less fuel than the planes the airline already had. He ordered 23 A300s. After this, Pan Am also ordered some A300s. From then on, many A300s were sold, and 878 planes were given to airlines.
The body of the A300 was made longer (on the A330 and A340), shorter (on the A310), or was changed (for the A300-600ST "Beluga" Super Transporter).
In March 2006, Airbus said that it was no longer making the A300/A310. The last A300 first flew on 18 April 2007. It was delivered to FedEx on 12 July 2007.
Only two of these were built: the prototype, and a second aircraft. It can hold 300 passengers or 323 passengers, and it has two General Electric CF6-50A engines.
The first version to be made for airlines. It had General Electric CF6 or Pratt & Whitney JT9D engines. Air France was the first airline to use it, in May 1974. 
The version which was made the most. The first A300B4 made its first flight on 25 December 1974. Germanair got the first one on 23 May 1975.
This type's official name is the A300B4-600. It has more powerful CF6-80 or Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines, and it has the Honeywell 331-250 auxiliary power unit (APU). The A300-600 began being used in 1983 by Saudi Arabian Airlines The A300-600 also has a different cockpit (similar to the A310), so the flight engineer was not needed for this type. 
This type is shorter and does not need a flight engineer. 
It can also be used as a military plane. It is currently being used by the Canadian Forces and German Air Force. 260 of these planes were sold, but five of these were never made.
As of 2010, the A300 has had 54 accidents. There have been 26 hull-losses. 1,434 people have died on A300s. A hull-loss accident is an accident where the plane is completely destroyed, or if it is damaged so much that it cannot be fixed.
Only two A300s still exist today. There are:

Electroencephalography

Electroencephalography is a way to record certain patterns of brain activity, on the skin of the head. Nerve cells use electricity to transmit information. It is one of the methods of diagnosis which can be used for conditions that affect the nerves. An electroencephalogram is a recorded electroencephalography. Both are abbreviated EEG. Electroencephalography is used to detect epilepsy, coma, sleep and brain death. Special adaptations exists to research sleep, for example the length of sleep rhythms. Sleep occurs in different phases, the specially adapted EEG can show the length of these phases.
One way that scientists study EEG recordings is by looking at different waves in the EEG. These waves do not move across the body, but occur as changes in the signal at one place over time. They are studied using mathematical techniques for separating a signal into different frequencies. The slowest waves are called delta, and they occur at 1 to 4 cycles per second. Delta occurs in sleep and during anesthesia. The next frequency is called theta, and it occurs at 4 to 8 cycles per second. Theta is seen when a person is trying to keep many different things, such as numbers or words, in memory. It is also seen when a person is drowsy. After theta comes alpha, a wave occurring at 8 to 12 cycles per second. Alpha is seen over the back of the head when a person has his or her eyes shut. It is also seen when a person is resting or meditating. Faster than alpha is beta, a wave that occurs at 12 to 30 cycles per second. It is seen when a person is getting ready to move or no longer resting. It is also seen when a person takes benzodiazepine drugs. Finally, gamma is the fastest wave seen in EEG, occurring at 30 to 100 cycles per second. It is seen when a person is thinking or paying attention to something.

Regional language

A regional language is a language spoken in an area that is part of a larger nation state.
Internationally, the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, ""regional or minority languages" means languages that are:
A regional language is, in terms of political status, different from the official language of the country where it is spoken. The regional languages are sometimes recognized and protected by the regional government or the state: many states across the world recognize regional languages, and give them a status, as is the case, for example, of Wallonia, Spain, Italy or Switzerland. In other cases the state does not grant official status as an official language of the country; it is the case with the regional languages of France, which can be studied but cannot be used in the government or any public service, where only French is official.
In some cases, a regional language may be the main or official language of another country; that is the case, in Europe, of French in the Valle d'Aosta, or Slovene in Austria.
Status changes may take place either by laws within a state or is by political and territorial changes.
An example of the first case is Belgium, where only the French was the official language since the independence in 1831. In 1878, it was allowed that the provinces and districts where Flemish was spoken to use either French or Flemish; then, in 1938, Flemish became the official language of the northern part of Belgium.
For the second case, an example is the fragmentation of the Soviet Union where some regional languages, such as Latvian, Romanian or Georgian, became official languages in the new states formed after the fragmentation: Latvia, Moldova and Georgia.
In a federal state, an official language in a province, region or state, can be a regional language in other parts. That is the case, for example, in Canada, where the French is the official language in the province of Quebec but is a regional one in other provinces.

Wollemia is a genus of coniferous tree in the family Araucariaceae. It is a "living fossil", recently found in 1994. Its fossil record dates back 200 million years, and it was thought to be long extinct.
"Wollemia nobilis" was discovered in 1994 in a temperate rainforest wilderness area of the Wollemi National Park in New South Wales. in a remote series of narrow, steep-sided sandstone gorges near Lithgow, 150 kilometres north-west of Sydney.
In both botanical and popular literature the tree has been called the Wollemi Pine. It is not a true pine (genus "Pinus") nor a member of the pine family (Pinaceae), but is related to "Agathis" and "Araucaria" in the family Araucariaceae.
The Wollemi pine is classified as Critically Endangered (CR - D) on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List 2002. It is legally protected in Australia. A Recovery Plan has been drawn up, outlining strategies for the management of this fragile population; the overall objective is to ensure that this species remains viable in the long-term.

Cuban Spanish

Cuban Spanish is a dialect of the Spanish language. It is the dialect spoken in Cuba. It shares many of the same features as other Caribbean dialects of Spanish.
Much of Cuban Spanish derives from the Spanish spoken in the Canary Islands of Spain. This is because large numbers of Canarian people moved to Cuba in the 19th and early 20th centuries. People from other Spanish communities, such as Galicians, Catalans, Basques and Asturians, also moved here, but did not have as much influence on the language as the Canarians did. Many words in Cuban Spanish come from the Canarian dialect, but some words are from other parts of Spain. There are also words that come from West African languages, French, or from the indigenous Taíno language.
The language is spoken differently from east to west. The eastern part of the island had large plantations where many African slaves worked during the 18th and 19th centuries. Therefore, the east has a stronger influence from African languages (such as Yoruba and Kikongo) than the west. It is closer to Dominican Spanish than to the Spanish spoken in the western part of the island. The Haitian Creole language influenced the eastern Cuban culture after the Haitian Revolution. Some words of the eastern dialect can be traced back to Haitian Creole words used every day locally. Some Cubans can still speak Haitian Creole.

James Douglas, Lord of Douglas

Sir James Douglas (also known as Good Sir James and James the Black Douglas), (died 1330), was a Scottish soldier, knight and leader during the Wars of Scottish Independence. He is considered one of Scotland's greatest heroes. He was a follower and close friend of king Robert I of Scotland (also called Robert the Bruce).
James Douglas was the oldest son of William, Lord of Douglas and Elizabeth Stewart. His father, William, had refused to support king Edward I of England who had taken over Scotland in 1290. The English king put William in prison and took his lands. This left young James with no land and no father. Douglas then went to France where he lived a simple life for three years. On hearing of his father's death he returned to Scotland and went to see William of Lamberton, Bishop of St. Andrews. The bishop took James in and in due time Bishop Lamberton took James to see King Edward I of England. When the bishop asked for the lands of Douglas to be returned to James, the king grew angry and said no. The lordship of Douglas had been given to Robert Clifford and the king would hear no more of the matter. Douglas remained in the service of the bishop and did nothing to rebel against the king of England. He hoped to get his family's lands returned to him. But in 1306 Robert the Bruce claimed the crown of Scotland as king Robert I. Now Douglas had a choice between two kings who might restore his lands.
In 1307 Douglas joined king Robert against the English king, Edward I That spring James Douglas with some of his men attacked his father's castle of Douglas and defeated the English soldiers there. Douglas then burned his castle and destroyed all stores of wine and grain. He poisoned the wells and executed the English soldiers they . This event became known as Douglas' larder. Even though Douglas did not yet possess his father's lands he had influence in that region. He and his men of Douglas harried the English forces in the region all that summer. The tactics used by Bruce and his followers including Douglas were limited to surprise attacks and quick escapes. They burned enemy lands and rendered castles they captured useless to the English. On learning the Earl of Pembroke was moving a large army into Scotland, Douglas went to warn Robert Bruce. Bruce and Douglas split up and agreed to meet at another place. When they rejoined their forces they attacked the English and defeated them.
In several raids in 1307 and 1308 James Douglas provided support to King Robert in the south of Scotland. On the night of Tuesday 19 February 1314 James Douglas and his men wearing black coats to cover their armor attacked Roxbrugh Castle. Roxbrugh was the main English stronghold in south central Scotland. It was defended by 100 English soldiers. The fall of Roxbrugh Castle caused many in the area to flee back to England. Now held by Douglas it was the beginning of his reputation as "the Black Douglas". To the people of Scotland he was the "the Good Sir James". He was now one of the king's greatest supporter and a model of chivalry. But James had black hair and a reputation so feared by the English they named him "the Black Douglas." They said his evil success against them was because he was a demon himself. His son and grandson also used the feared name themselves continuing the family reputation.
Edward II of England had kept up the wars against the Bruce and his followers. He was growing more and more angry with each victory of Robert the Bruce and his followers. Determined to put an end to Bruce once and for all he assembled a very large army. It consisted of mounted knights, archers, crossbow-men, and foot soldiers led by Edward himself. the exact size of his army is unknown, but it was several times larger than that of Robert the Bruce. King Robert chose the place for the upcoming battle at Bannockburn very carefully He chose a position with several natural defenses many of which prevented heavy cavalry or large mass formations to operate. He formed his army into four 'battles' or Battalions, three of which consisted of 'hedgehog' or schiltrons Just before the battle began king Robert knighted Sir James Douglas, his cousin Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland, and many others. James and Walter were joint leaders of the left battalion.
When the English army was still approaching, king Robert sent Douglas and Sir Robert Keith, Marischal of Scotland to observe the English and report back to him. Douglas and Keith reported king Edward was approaching with a very large army. During the battle most of the fighting was directed at the other two battalions. When the center battalion led by Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray was in trouble, Douglas went to their rescue of his close friend. But the English retreated before Douglas could help. Finally the Scots won the battle and the English fell back in confusion, king Edward with 500 mounted knights fled the field. James Douglas with a small mounted force gave chase to the English king. They chased them all the way to Dunbar, but Edward escaped back to England.
After English defeat at Bannockburn the northern border of England was very lightly defended. In August of 1314 James Douglas, along with Edward Bruce (the king's brother), and John of Soules led a large raid into England. From 1314 to 1319 Douglas was raiding northern England at least once a year. When Edward Bruce left for Ireland in 1317 Douglas took his place as leader in the south of Scotland. These raids were not just to frighten the English but to get cash payment for king of Scotland for not attacking that village. It was also to prove to the English that their king Edward II could not protect them. Douglas was the one of the main leader in the wars on the English border until the final peace in 1328.
Two times, in 1319 and in 1322, when Douglas raided into Yorkshire he tried to capture King Edward II and his wife Queen Isabella of France. While he did not succeed this only added to his reputation by the English as "the Black Douglas." On 25 December 1319 the Scots and English signed a two year truce. In 1320, James Douglas put his seal on the Declaration of Arbroath. This declaration of Scottish independence was in the form of a letter to Pope John XXII.
During this period Douglas was rewarded many times with grants of lands. One grant was not of land but of privileges. Called the Emerald Charter, it gave James Douglas and his heirs freedom from many obligations to the king. It also made Douglas and his heirs a judge in their own lands. In giving James Douglas this special grant the king took an emerald ring from his finger and placed it on Douglas' finger. His importance to King Robert and to Scotland was increasing as time went on. 
In 1328 Robert the Bruce was in poor health and was dying. One thing he had not been able to do was to go on a crusade. He asked his friend Sir James Douglas to take his heart to the Holy Land. The king died on 7 June 1329. After the king's death James Douglas had a silver casket made and placed in it the heart of Robert the Bruce. He kept it safe on a chain around his neck. In 1330 he and six knights set out in a ship with royal banners. This is so all who saw it would know the heart of Robert, King of Scotland was on its way to Jerusalem in the Holy Land. The ship waited at Sluys, Flanders for other knights to join them before continuing on their voyage. They sailed to Spain where they stopped at Seville. They were welcomed by Alfonso XI, King of Castile and Leon as well as many English knights who had come to Spain to fight against the Moors. In August 1330 outside the walls of the Moorish town of Teba de Ardales Douglas and his knights joined the king's army. King Alfonso asked Douglas if he would lead the vanguard and placed all the English and Scottish knights under his command. Douglas ordered the charge and the fighting began right away. When the moors pretended to retreat, Douglas and ten of his knights chased after them. But it was a trick and the Moors turned and surrounded them. Trying to rescue a fellow knight Douglas and all his knights were killed. Sir James Douglas was found with the silver casket still around his neck. His body was made ready for the trip home. The silver casket containing the heart of Bruce never reached the Holy Land. It was buried at the Abbey of Melrose. Sir James Douglas was buried at the Kirk of Douglas.
