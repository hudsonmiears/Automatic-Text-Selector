List of Native American Medal of Honor recipients

This is a list of Native Americans presented the nation's highest military decoration — the Medal of Honor. The Medal of Honor is bestowed "for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty, in actual combat against an armed enemy force." The medal is presented by the President of the United States on behalf of the Congress.
Of the 3,469 Medals of Honor presented as of 2012 only 28 have been given to Native Americans.
The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War. It is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal it is commonly presented after the recipient was killed (posthumously).

Protectionist Party

The Protectionist Party was an Australian political party from 1889 until 1909. Its policies were based on protectionism. It argued that Australia needed protective tariffs to allow Australian industry to grow and provide employment. It had its greatest strength in Victoria and in the rural areas of New South Wales. Its most important leaders were Sir Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin, who were the first and second prime pinisters of Australia.
The Protectionist Party formed government Australia's first government with the support of the Labor Party. They agreed to put in place social reforms that were Labor policy. Labor's program, however, was often too radical for the Protectionists, and compromises had to be made. Several changes of minority governments occurred.
The Protectionist vote had dropped by the 1906 federal election. Labor formed its first government in 1904 and its second in 1908 under Andrew Fisher. Many people believed an anti-socialist group was needed to oppose the Labor Party. Deakin and Anti-Socialist Party leader Joseph Cook, began talks to join their parties together. The more liberal Protectionists, such as Isaac Isaacs and H. B. Higgins, opposed a merger. The Protection Party was split by this issue. Most members, including Deakin, joined with the Anti-Socialist Party to become the Commonwealth Liberal Party. This became known as "the Fusion,". The more liberal Protectionists supported Labor. The Fusion would form another minority government before Fisher and Labor achieved Australia's first federal majority government, and the first Senate majority, at the 1910 election.
In 2007, a new political party, the Australian Protectionist Party was set up.

Fallingwater

Fallingwater is the name of the summer house Frank Lloyd Wright designed in 1935 for the Kaufmann family. It is in the woods over a waterfall in Pennsylvania. It is a nationally listed national historic place, and some say it is the most famous private house in the world.
The house actually sits low in the valley over the stream, but looks dramatic from further downstream. It has large terraces, and some of them stick straight out and hang right over the waterfall or the stream. There are windows and glass doors, with only narrow steel supports between them, wrapping all the way around the living room. There are also windows going all the way from the floor to the ceiling in all three stories of the tower. Most of the house is made from stone. 
There are strong horizontal and vertical lines in the design of the house. It resembles the horizontal and vertical lines in the rock formations and other natural features. The waterfall can be heard everywhere in the house. Wright wanted there to be a close connection between inside and outside, and for the house itself to be natural.
The large, cave-like living room has a big fireplace built on a large rock that comes up out of the floor. This was Edgar Kaufmann's favorite place to sit before the house was built. A stairway hangs down from the main floor to the stream. A glass hatchway lets people go down it from the living room.
Some of the furniture is built right into the house. Many shelves are attached directly into the wall, sticking out without any supports that can be seen, like the floors and terraces of the house itself. 
There is a guest house on the hill behind the main house. It is connected by an "S" shaped, covered walk. There is a plunge pool beside the guest house.
In 1991, members of the American Institute of Architects named the Fallingwater house the "best all-time work of American architecture".

<doc id="377073" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=377073" title="Commonwealth Liberal Party">
Commonwealth Liberal Party

The Commonwealth Liberal Party (CLP) was a political party in Australia from 1909 to 1917. It was also known as The Fusion, or the Deakinite Liberal Party. It is the earliest direct ancestor of the modern Liberal Party of Australia.
The party was formed after the Australian Labor Party formed its second government in 1908. Business leaders told Alfred Deakin, the leader of the Protectionist Party, and Joseph Cook, leader of the Anti-Socialist Party, to join forces to oppose the Labor Party. In 1909, the Protectionists and Anti-Socialists joined to form the CLP. Deakin was the new party's first leader, with Cook as deputy leader. Several of the more liberal Protectionists left and joined Labor. 
The Protectionists and Anti-Socialists had a majority of seats in the House of Representatives. The new party used its numbers to force Prime Minister Andrew Fisher to resign. Deakin became Prime Minister for the third time. However, the CLP was defeated by Labor at its first election, less than a year later in 1910. 
Cook took over from Deakin shortly before the 1913 election and won government by a single seat. One year later, Cook introduced a bill removing special treatment for union members. Cook knew the Labor Party had the numbers in Senate to defeat the bill. When the Senate rejected it twice, Cook had an excuse to call an early election for 5 September. This was the first double dissolution election in Australia. However CLP was soundly defeated, and Labor became the government. 
In November 1916, the CLP made a deal with the Prime Minister Billy Hughes. Hughes had been forced to leave the ALP for supporting conscription in World War I. He set up a new party called the National Labor Party. In February 1917, the CLP and National Labor joined to form the Nationalist Party of Australia. Although the new party had more Liberals, Hughes became its leader with Cook as his deputy.
Today the Commonwealth Liberal Party is usually called the Deakinite Liberal Party so it will not be confused with the modern Liberal Party of Australia.

<doc id="377081" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=377081" title="Australian Electoral Commission">
Australian Electoral Commission

The Australian Electoral Commission, or the AEC, is the Australian federal government agency in charge of federal elections and referendums. State and local government elections are run by the Electoral Commission in each state and territory.
The AEC also draws the boundaries for seats and makes regular changes to keep all seats roughly equal in population numbers. It organizes Commonwealth electoral roll which is a list of people who can vote in elections. The electoral roll is used by the state and territory Electoral Commissions to for their elections.
The AEC also plays a leading role in electoral education and industrial voting (votes on industrial action).
The AEC began in 1902, as a part of the Department of Home Affairs. In 1973, it became the Australian Electoral Office. In February 1984 it became the Australian Electoral Commission.
The AEC is run by a Chairman who is a Judge, or a retired Judge, of the Federal Court, the Electoral Commissioner and a non-judicial member who is usually the Australian Statistician). The Electoral Commissioner has the powers of a Secretary of a Department under the "Public Service Act 1999" and the "Financial Management and Accountability Act 1998". The Chairperson and the third, non-judicial member both hold their offices on a part-time basis.
The AEC has a National Office in Canberra and State Offices in Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney.
Each federal electorate has a Divisional Returning Officer responsible for the House of Representatives elections within their division. Each State also has an Australian Electoral Officer responsible for the Senate elections.
The AEC's major duties are to run federal elections, by-elections and referendums. Election Rolls must always be up-to-date. The AEC must also follow up people who do not vote. After the election the AEC provides detailed election results. The AEC is answerable to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters of the Parliament of Australia. It reports to Parliament on how elections were carried out and the success of the elections in general.

<doc id="377084" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=377084" title="National Labor Party">
National Labor Party

The National Labor Party was an Australian political party which only existed for three months. It was started by Prime Minister Billy Hughes in November 1916. Hughes had taken over as leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and Prime Minister when Andrew Fisher resigned in 1915. Hughes formed the new party after he was forced out of the ALP a month after conscription was rejected by the people in the 1916 vote. Hughes still wanted conscription for World War I. 
On 15 September 1916 the Labor Party in New South Wales forced Hughes from the Labor Party. On 14 November 1916, Hughes and 24 other Labor members walked out of a meeting of the Labor members of parliament. The remaining 43 members said they did not want Hughes to continue as their leader. Hughes and his followers formed a minority Government with support from the Commonwealth Liberal Party (CLP) led by Joseph Cook. They said the Australian Labor Party was no longer nationalist. They wanted a new party that would be both socially radical and nationalist. 
The National Labor Party had to depend on support from the Commonwealth Liberal Party to govern. In 1917 the two groups joined to form a new party, the Nationalist Party of Australia, with Hughes as leader. 
The National Labor Party was never a proper political party. It did not have any organisational structure. It did get support from some trade union officials and Labor Party branches, particularly in Western Australia and Tasmania.
The National Labor Party in Western Australia started off as two separate groups. One group was the Labor Solidarity Committee based in Perth. The other was National Labor based on the goldfields. The two joined in April-May 1917, led by former Premier John Scaddan. After he lost his seat in Parliament the party turned to Federal Senators Patrick Lynch, Hugh de Largie and George Pearce for leadership and guidance. Unlike the federal party, it did not join with the CLP and kept its own identity. It worked with the Nationalist Party as partners.
The party won six of 50 Assembly seats in the Western Australian state elections of 1917 and 1921. It also held three of 30 Council seats during this period. However, in 1924 elections they won only one seat in the Assembly and two in the Council. Later that year they were taken over by the Nationalists.

<doc id="377086" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=377086" title="Fracking">
Fracking

Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is forcing fractures in a rock layer, by fluid that is put under pressure. It can happen naturally, but it is now used to force oil and natural gas from shale.
Some hydraulic fractures form naturally: certain dykes are examples. This lets gas and petroleum from source rocks get to reservoir rocks. 
The first use of hydraulic fracturing was in 1947. The modern fracturing technique, called 'horizontal slickwater fracturing', was first used in 1998. It made the extraction of shale gas economical. The energy from the injection of a highly pressurized fluid creates new channels in the rock, which increases the extraction rates and recovery of hydrocarbons. In 2010 it was estimated that 60% of all new oil and gas wells worldwide were being hydraulically fractured. As of 2012, 2.5 million hydraulic fracturing jobs have been performed on oil and gas wells worldwide, more than one million of them in the United States.
Proponents of hydraulic fracturing point to the economic benefits from the vast amounts of previously out of reach hydrocarbons. Opponents point to potential environmental effects, such as contamination of ground water, risks to air quality, the migration of gases and hydraulic fracturing chemicals to the surface, surface contamination from spills and flowback and the health effects of these. For these reasons hydraulic fracturing has come under scrutiny, with some countries suspending or banning it. 
However, some of those countries, including most notably the United Kingdom, have recently lifted their bans. Now they have regulations instead of outright prohibition. It turns out that the UK has huge gas reserves if fracking is used.

Hiroshi Miyamura

Hiroshi H. Miyamura (born October 6, 1925), also known as Hershey Miyamura, was a United States Army soldier. He received the Medal of Honor because of his actions in the Korean War.
Miyamura was born in Gallup, New Mexico to Japanese immigrant parents. He is a "Nisei", which means that he is a second generation Japanese-American.
Miyamura joined the US Army in January 1945.
Miyamura volunteered to be part of the all-"Nisei" 100th Infantry Battalion. This army unit was mostly made up of Japanese Americans from Hawaii and the mainland.
After the end of World War II, he became part of the U.S. Army Reserve. He was called to active duty in the Korean War. He was a prisoner of war for 28 months.
Miyamura's Medal of Honor recognized his conduct in fighting in Korea in 1951. He fought in close quarters combat; and he stayed behind to provide covering fire while his unit withdrew.
The words of Miyamura's citation explain:
Cpl. Miyamura, a member of Company H, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy. On the night of 24 April, Company H was occupying a defensive position when the enemy fanatically attacked threatening to overrun the position. Cpl. Miyamura, a machinegun squad leader, aware of the imminent danger to his men unhesitatingly jumped from his shelter wielding his bayonet in close hand-to-hand combat killing approximately 10 of the enemy. Returning to his position, he administered first aid to the wounded and directed their evacuation. As another savage assault hit the line, he manned his machinegun and delivered withering fire until his ammunition was expended. He ordered the squad to withdraw while he stayed behind to render the gun inoperative. He then bayoneted his way through infiltrated enemy soldiers to a second gun emplacement and assisted in its operation. When the intensity of the attack necessitated the withdrawal of the company Cpl. Miyamura ordered his men to fall back while he remained to cover their movement. He killed more than 50 of the enemy before his ammunition was depleted and he was severely wounded. He maintained his magnificent stand despite his painful wounds, continuing to repel the attack until his position was overrun. When last seen he was fighting ferociously against an overwhelming number of enemy soldiers. Cpl. Miyamura's indomitable heroism and consummate devotion to duty reflect the utmost glory on himself and uphold the illustrious traditions on the military service.
Miyamura is the namesake of an area in Gallup, New Mexico. The Hiroshi H. Miyamura High School is named after him.
An I-40 highway interchange is also named after him. It is also called the Miyamura Overpass.

The Twelve Days of Christmas

The Twelve Days of Christmas are the festive days which begin on Christmas Day (25 December). This is also known as Christmastide and Twelvetide. The Twelfth Night of Christmas is always on the evening of 5 January. The Twelfth Day can either be before or follow the Twelfth Night according to which Christian tradition is followed. Twelfth Night is followed by the Feast of the Epiphany on 6 January. In some traditions, the first day of Epiphany (6 January) and the twelfth day of Christmas are the same.
Over the centuries, differing churches and sects of Christianity have changed the actual traditions, time frame and their interpretations. St. Stephen's Day (or Boxing Day), for example, is 26 December in the Western Church and 27 December in the Eastern Church. 28 December is Childermas or the Feast of the Innocents. Currently, the twelve days and nights are celebrated in widely varying ways around the world. For example, some give gifts only on Christmas Day, some only on Twelfth Night, and some each of the twelve nights. The song "The Twelve Days of Christmas" is about this giving of gifts.

Gosei (fifth-generation Nikkei)

The character and uniqueness of the "Gosei" is recognized in its social history. The "Gosei" are the subject of on-going academic research in the United States and in Japan.
The earliest organized group of Japanese emigrants settled in Mexico in 1897.
Imigration to Brazil began in 1908. Today, the community which grew from the immigrant children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren has become the largest Japanese emigrant population outside of Japan, including approximately 1.5 million Brazilians. Other communities of "Yonsei" grew up in the United States, Canada, and Peru. 
The use of the term "Gosei" was modeled after an "Issei" pattern or template. In the 1930s, the term "Issei" came into common use. The word replaced the term "immigrant" ("ijusha"). This change in usage mirrored an evolution in the way the "Issei" looked at themselves. The label "Issei" also included the idea of belonging to the new country.
The term "Nikkei" (日系) was created by sociologists in the late 20th century. The "Nikkei" include all of the world's Japanese immigrants and their descendants.
The "Issei" were born in Japan, and their cultural perspective was primarily Japanese; but they were in another country by choice. Their "Gosei" great-great-grandsons and great-great-granddaughters grew up with a national and cultural point-of-view that was different from their parents.
Although the "Issei" kept an emotional connection with Japan, they created homes in a country far from Japan. The "Gosei" had never known a country other than the one into which they were born.
The "Issei," "Nisei", "Sansei", "Yonsei" and "Gosei" generations reflect distinctly different attitudes to authority, gender, religious practice, and other matters.
Differences among these national "Gosei" developed because of the histories of their Japanese emigrant ancestors.
Japanese-Brazilian ("Nipo-brasileiro") "Gosei" are a small part of an ethnic minority in Brazil. In 1990, 0.8% of the "Nipo-Brasileiros" community were "Gosei."
Japanese-Canadian "Gosei" are typical for any ethnic group.
Japanese-Peruvian ("Nipo-peruano") "Gosei" make up less than 1.0% of the "Nikkei" population in 2000.
The lives of the Japanese-Americans of earlier generations contrasts with the "Gosei" because they have English-speaking grandparents. According to a 2011 columnist in "The Rafu Shimpo" of Los Angeles, "Younger Japanese Americans are more culturally American than Japanese" and "other than some vestigial cultural affiliations, a "Yonsei" or "Gosei" is simply another American."

Loie Fuller

Loie (or Loïe) Fuller (January 15, 1862 – January 1, 1928) was a pioneer of modern dance. She had no dance training, but got experience acting on the stage. A chance experiment with an over-long skirt gave her ideas which she eventually developed into a dance.
Fuller was born Marie Louise Fuller in the Chicago suburb of Fullersburg (now Hinsdale, Illinois). She began her theatrical career as a professional child actress and later choreographed and performed dances in burlesque (as a skirt dancer), vaudeville, and circus shows. 
Fuller developed her own natural movement and improvisation techniques. Fuller combined her choreography with silk costumes illuminated by multi-coloured lighting of her own design.
Although Fuller became famous in America through works such as "Serpentine Dance" (1891), she felt that she was not taken seriously by the public. Her warm reception in Paris during a European tour persuaded Fuller to remain in France. A regular performer at the Folies Bergère with works such as "Fire Dance", Fuller became the embodiment of the Art Nouveau movement. An 1896 film of the "Serpentine Dance" gives a hint of what her performance was like (the unknown dancer in the film is not Fuller).
Fuller's autobiographical memoire ""Quinze ans de ma vie" was written in French and published by in 1908 with an introduction by Anatole France. She drafted her memoires again in English a few years later, which were published under the title "Fifteen Years of a Dancer's Life"" by Herbert Jenkins (London) in 1913. The New York Public Library Jerome Robbins Dance Collection holds the nearly complete manuscript to the English edition and materials related to the French edition.

Frank Ono

Frank H. Ono (June 5, 1923 – May 6, 1980) was a United States Army soldier. He received the Medal of Honor because of his actions in World War II.
Ono was born in Colorado. His parents were immigrants from Japan. He was a "Nisei", which means that he was a second generation Japanese-American.
Ono joined the US Army in September 1943.
He volunteered to be part of the all-"Nisei" 442nd Regimental Combat Team. This army unit was mostly made up of Japanese Americans from Hawaii and the mainland.
For his actions in July 1944, Ono was awarded the Army's second-highest decoration, the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). In the 1990s, there was a review of service records of Asian Americans who received the DSC during World War II. Ono's award was upgraded to the Medal of Honor. In a ceremony at the White House on June 21, 2000, his family was presented with his medal by President Bill Clinton. Twenty-one other Asian Americans also received the medal during the ceremony, but only seven of them were still alive.
Ono's Medal of Honor recognized his conduct in fighting in northern Italy in 1944. He held an advance position alone. He treated wounded men; and he remained behind to provide covering fire as his unit withdrew.
The words of Ono's citation explain:
Private First Class Frank H. Ono distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action on 4 July 1944, near Castellina, Italy. In attacking a heavily defended hill, Private First Class Ono's squad was caught in a hail of formidable fire from the well-entrenched enemy. Private First Class Ono opened fire with his automatic rifle and silenced one machine gun 300 hundred yards to the right front. Advancing through incessant fire, he killed a sniper with another burst of fire, and while his squad leader reorganized the rest of the platoon in the rear, he alone defended the critical position. His weapon was then wrenched from his grasp by a burst of enemy machine pistol fire as enemy troops attempted to close in on him. Hurling hand grenades, Private First Class Ono forced the enemy to abandon the attempt, resolutely defending the newly won ground until the rest of the platoon moved forward. Taking a wounded comrade's rifle, Private First Class Ono again joined in the assault. After killing two more enemy soldiers, he boldly ran through withering automatic, small arms, and mortar fire to render first aid to his platoon leader and a seriously wounded rifleman. In danger of being encircled, the platoon was ordered to withdraw. Volunteering to cover the platoon, Private First Class Ono occupied virtually unprotected positions near the crest of the hill, engaging an enemy machine gun emplaced on an adjoining ridge and exchanging fire with snipers armed with machine pistols. Completely disregarding his own safety, he made himself the constant target of concentrated enemy fire until the platoon reached the comparative safety of a draw. He then descended the hill in stages, firing his rifle, until he rejoined the platoon. Private First Class Ono's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.

ARM architecture is a computer CPU architecture commonly used in embedded systems and mobile devices such as cell phones, smartphones, tablet computers, and handheld game consoles such as the Game Boy Advance. ARM CPUs use very little electricity and produce very little heat. Most ARM CPUs run on battery power and don't need a cooling fan. The Linux operating system is used most on ARM CPUs. ARM is, as of 2013, the world's most popular 32-bit CPU architecture, particularly due to the large number of embedded systems sold. 
A 64-bit version of ARM has been announced, and support for this 64-bit variant has been added to the Linux kernel. The 64-bit variant will first be used for servers, and later for the next generation of mobile phones and tablet computers. The 64-bit version will allow programs to access more than 4 GB of RAM, but at the cost of slightly higher electricity usage.

<doc id="377255" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=377255" title="Nationalist Party of Australia">
Nationalist Party of Australia

The Nationalist Party of Australia was an Australian political party. It began on 17 February 1917 when the conservative Commonwealth Liberal Party and the National Labor Party (NLP) joined together. The Nationalist Party held government until 1929. It was the major opposition to the Labor party. In 1931 it joined with a group who left the Labor Party led by Joseph Lyons and became the United Australia Party. This was the basis of the Liberal Party of Australia which began in 1944.
In October 1915 Prime Minister Andrew Fisher retired. The Australian Labor Party (ALP) chose Billy Hughes to be the new leader and Prime Minister. He was a strong supporter of Australia's participation in World War I. After a visit to Britain in 1916 he decided that conscription was necessary to get enough soldiers for the Australian army. Most of his party, especially the trade unions, did not support conscription. There were also many Irish Roman Catholics in the Labor Party who did not want to support the British government. This was because of the British government's actions against the Irish Easter Uprising of 1916. In October Hughes held a plebiscite to get support to start conscription, but the plebiscite was narrowly defeated. Melbourne's Catholic Archbishop, Daniel Mannix, was his main opponent on the conscription issue. Hughes continued to argue in favour of conscription. This produced a deep and bitter split within the Australian community, as well as within the members of his own party. 
On 15 September 1916 NSW branch of the Labor Party forced Hughes from the Labor Party. When the Federal Parliamentary Labor caucus met on 14 November 1916, there was a lot of argument. Hughes and 24 other Labor members walked out. The remaining 43 members passed a motion of no confidence in the leadership. This removed Hughes and the other members from the ALP.
Hughes and his followers formed a new party, the National Labor Party. They were able to govern with support from Joseph Cook and his Commonwealth Liberal Party. In February 1917, the two groups joined to form the Nationalist Party, with Hughes as leader and Cook as deputy leader. The Nationlists, with Liberal and Labor members, were able to present an image of national unity.
In May 1917 the Nationalists won a huge electoral victory. At this election Hughes abandoned his working-class seat of West Sydney, and was elected for Bendigo in Victoria. Hughes had promised to resign if his Government did not win the power to conscript. A second vote was held in December 1917, but was again defeated, this time by even more votes. Hughes resigned as Prime Minister but, as he was the leader of the majority party, the Governor-General, Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson, immediately asked him to be Prime Minister again. Hughes was able to remain as Prime Minister while keeping his promise to resign.
Hughes and the Nationalists governed on their own until the elections of 1922. The new Country Party gained quite a few seats in the House of Representatives. The Nationalists did not have a majority to govern and needed Country Party support. However, the Country Party did not like Hughes' rural policy. Their leader, Earle Page said he would not serve under him. Many in the Nationalist Party did not fully support Hughes, suspecting he was still really a socialist. Page's demand finally gave them an excuse, and without support Hughes was forced to resign in January 1923. Former Treasurer Stanley Bruce was chosen as leader, and quickly entered into a coalition with the Country Party. The price, however, was high. The Country Party demanded five seats in cabinet (out of 11), including the Treasurer's post and the deputy Prime Minister position for Page. However, Bruce agreed rather than force another election. This was the start of the traditional coalition of non-Labor parties.
Under Bruce's leadership the Nationalists became much more conservative. The Nationalist-Country coalition won a huge victory in 1925. It was reelected in 1928, though with a significantly less support. In 1929 when Bruce tried to bring in new laws to change the industrial arbitration system, this was too much for Hughes. He and his supportes voted against the laws, and the government, no longer controlling a majority, called an early election.
The Coalition was defeated, even Bruce even lost his own seat. He was succeeded as leader by former Attorney-General John Latham. The Nationalists were never a real force in Australian politics again. Having only ever been in government they were not prepared for a role in opposition. However in 1931, a group of Labor Party members led by Joseph Lyons, left the ALP to join the conservatives. They formed a new group, the United Australia Party (UAP). Most of the UAP were former Nationalists, but they chose Lyons as leader and Prime Minister The UAP replaced the Nationalists as the main conservative anti-Labor Party.
Around 1929 Robert Menzies, a member of the Victorian Parliament, joined with Wilfrid Kent Hughes to form the Young Nationalists Organisation. Menzies was its first President.
The organisation kept its name when even when the Nationalists became the UAP. Half the UAP members elected in the 1932 Victorian state election were Young Nationalists. In 1932 the Premier, Sir Stanley Argyle, included three of them in his eight-person cabinet, including Menzies as Deputy Premier.
Later, when Menzies founded the Liberal Party of Australia, he invited delegates from the Young Nationalists to attend. The Young Nationalists followed the UAP into the Liberal Party, and Menzies formed the Young Liberals to replace them.

Australian Labor Party (NSW)

The Australian Labor Party (NSW) was an Australian political party commonly known as Lang Labor. It was the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party which broke away from the national party and acted independently from 1931 to 1936.
In 1931 Jack Lang, the Premier of New South Wales, announced the "Lang Plan". This plan would reduce the effects of the Great Depression. The main feature of the plan was to stop making loan repayments to foreign banks. This was the opposite of the policy of the federal Labor government led by James Scullin. As a result, Lang's supporters, led by Jack Beasley and Eddie Ward, were forced out of the federal Caucus. 
This led to a split between the Federal and State leaders of the Labor party. In 1931 Lang's supporters voted with the United Australia Party Opposition in the House of Representatives to bring down the Scullin government. This caused an early election. The New South Wales Branch ran candidates as the Australian Labor Party (New South Wales). They were known as "Lang Labor" candidates. Supporters of the federal party (led in New South Wales by Ted Theodore and Ben Chifley) were known as Federal Labor candidates. 
The elections were a huge defeat for Labor, but most of the Lang members had safe working class seats and survived. Ward was narrowly defeated in East Sydney. (He was re-elected at a by-election in 1932). Theodore and Chifley were both defeated, and Federal Labor won only three seats in New South Wales. At the 1934 federal elections Federal Labor won only one seat (Newcastle).
In 1935 John Curtin became the new federal Labor leader. In February 1936 he brought about a reconciliation with the New South Wales Branch. At the 1937 elections Labor ran as a united party in New South Wales.

Division of Newcastle

The Division of Newcastle is a Federal Electoral Division for the Australian House of Representatives in the state of New South Wales. The Division is centred around the city of Newcastle, after which it is named.
The Division was one of the original 75 divisions set up for the first Federal election in 1901. It has been held by the Australian Labor Party since it was created. Labor has never got less than 58 percent of the two-party vote in a general election. It has only come close to losing it once, when it got 53 percent in a 1935 by-election. It is the only original Division to be held by just one party since the first Federal election. 
The Division of Newcastle has had just five members since 1901. This is the fewest of any of the original Divisions. From 1901 to 1958, the seat was held by the Watkins family. David Oliver took over from his father David in 1935. Allan Morris' brother, Peter was also in the Federal Parliament, representing the Division of Shortland. Charles Jones' brother, Sam, was in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly.

Kazuo Otani

Kazuo Otani (June 2, 1918 – July 15, 1944) was a United States Army was a United States Army soldier. He received the Medal of Honor because of his actions in World War II.
Otani was born in California. His parents were immigrants from Japan. He was a "Nisei", which means that he was a second generation Japanese-American.
Otani's family was interned at the Gila River War Relocation Center in Arizona
Otani joined the US Army in 1943.
He volunteered to be part of the all-"Nisei" 442nd Regimental Combat Team. This army unit was mostly made up of Japanese Americans from Hawaii and the mainland.
For his actions in July 1944, Otani was awarded the Army's second-highest decoration, the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC).
Otani, aged 26 at his death, was buried in Veterans Liberty Cemetery, Fresno, California.
In the 1990s, there was a review of service records of Asian Americans who received the DSC during World War II. Otani's award was upgraded to the Medal of Honor. In a ceremony at the White House on June 21, 2000, his family was presented with his medal by President Bill Clinton. Twenty-one other Asian Americans also received the medal during the ceremony, but only seven of them were still alive.
Otani's Medal of Honor recognized his conduct in fighting in northern Italy in 1944. He drew fire towards himself so that his platoon could reach cover. He was killed while rescuing a wounded man.
The words of Otani's citation explain:
Staff Sergeant Kazuo Otani distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action on 15 July 1944, near Pieve Di S. Luce, Italy. Advancing to attack a hill objective, Staff Sergeant Otani's platoon became pinned down in a wheat field by concentrated fire from enemy machine gun and sniper positions. Realizing the danger confronting his platoon, Staff Sergeant Otani left his cover and shot and killed a sniper who was firing with deadly effect upon the platoon. Followed by a steady stream of machine gun bullets, Staff Sergeant Otani then dashed across the open wheat field toward the foot of a cliff, and directed his men to crawl to the cover of the cliff. When the movement of the platoon drew heavy enemy fire, he dashed along the cliff toward the left flank, exposing himself to enemy fire. By attracting the attention of the enemy, he enabled the men closest to the cliff to reach cover. Organizing these men to guard against possible enemy counterattack, Staff Sergeant Otani again made his way across the open field, shouting instructions to the stranded men while continuing to draw enemy fire. Reaching the rear of the platoon position, he took partial cover in a shallow ditch and directed covering fire for the men who had begun to move forward. At this point, one of his men became seriously wounded. Ordering his men to remain under cover, Staff Sergeant Otani crawled to the wounded soldier who was lying on open ground in full view of the enemy. Dragging the wounded soldier to a shallow ditch, Staff Sergeant Otani proceeded to render first aid treatment, but was mortally wounded by machine gun fire. Staff Sergeant Otani's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.

List of Asian American Medal of Honor recipients

The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War and is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented posthumously.
Of the 3,476 Medals of Honor presented as of September 15, 2011, 30 have been awarded to Asian American recipients. The first Asian American to receive the Medal was José B. Nísperos. He received it for his actions in the Philippine–American War.
In 1996, a study determined that Asian Americans were discriminated against in the awarding of medals during World War II; consequently, 22 had their medals upgraded to the Medal of Honor. Except for those awarded during the 1996 discrimination study the most recent Asian American recipient of the Medal of Honor was Rodney Yano. He received it for his actions during the Vietnam War.
The Philippine–American War was an armed military conflict between the United States and the First Philippine Republic. It was fought between 1899 and least 1902. The conflict started from a Filipino political struggle against U.S. occupation of the Philippines. Although the conflict was officially declared over on July 4, 1902, American troops continued hostilities against remnants of the Philippine Army and other resistance groups until 1913. Some historians consider these unofficial extensions part of the war.
During this conflict one Asian American, José Nísperos, received the Medal of Honor. He got it for continuing to fight after being seriously wounded. He was the first person of Asian descent to receive it.
Telesforo Trinidad received a Medal of Honor after rescuing two men from a boiler explosion. He is the only Asian American sailor to receive the Medal during peacetime.
World War II, or the Second World War, was a global military conflict. It was started from the joining of what had initially been two separate conflicts. The first began in Asia in 1937 as the Second Sino-Japanese War. The other began in Europe in 1939 with the German invasion of Poland. This global conflict split the majority of the world's nations into two opposing military alliances. One was called the Allies. The other was called the Axis powers. It involved the mobilization of over 100 million military personnel. Thi makes it the most widespread war in history. It placed the participants in a state of total war. That erased the distinction between civil and military resources. This resulted in the complete activation of a nation's economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities for the purposes of the war effort. Over 60 million people, the majority of them civilians, were killed. It is the deadliest conflict in human history. The Allies were victorious and the United States and Soviet Union emerged as the world's two leading superpowers.
During this conflict 464 United States military personnel received the Medal of Honor. 266 of them posthumously. By the end of the war only two Asian Americans had been awarded the Medal of Honor. One was to Sergeant Jose Calugas of the Philippine Scouts. The second was to Private Sadao S. Munemori of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. A 1996 study commissioned by the United States Army by order of Congress investigated racial discrimination in the awarding of medals during World War II. The Command History Office at the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center at the Presidio of Monterey, California was tasked with identifying affected service-members and reviewing the records. After performing a review of the files, the study recommended that several Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders who received the Distinguished Service Cross during World War II should be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. On June 21, 2000, President Bill Clinton awarded the Medal to 22 Asian Americans, 21 from the aforementioned study, in a ceremony at the White House.
Of the 24 Asian American awardees, 21 earned the Medal while serving with the 442nd Regimental Combat Team or its component unit, the 100th Infantry Battalion, making the 442nd the most decorated regiment-sized unit of the war. Only two Asian American officers received the Medal of Honor during World War II: Captain Francis B. Wai who received it for drawing enemy fire to himself to reveal their positions and Second Lieutenant Daniel Inouye who received his medal for destroying two machine gun nests and continuing to fight after being wounded. Inouye became the first U.S. Representative for Hawaii and the first Japanese American congressman; he served as one of Hawaii's U.S. Senators from 1963 continuously until his death in 2012.
The Korean War was an escalation of border clashes between two rival Korean regimes, each of which was supported by external powers; each tried to topple the other through political and guerilla tactics. In a narrow sense, some may refer to it as a civil war, though many other factors were at play. After failing to strengthen their cause in the free elections held in South Korea during May 1950 and the refusal of South Korea to hold new elections per North Korean demands, the communist North Korean Army moved south on June 25, 1950 to attempt to reunite the Korean peninsula, which had been formally divided since 1948. The conflict was then expanded by the United States and the Soviet Union's involvement as part of the larger Cold War. The main hostilities were during the period from June 25, 1950 until the armistice was signed on July 27, 1953. In the early stages of the war, President Harry Truman sometimes described the conflict under the aegis of the United Nations as a "police action" rather than use the term war.
One Asian American received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Korean War. Hiroshi H. Miyamura was captured by Chinese forces and held as a prisoner of war for 28 months. For his protection, news of his Medal of Honor award was classified until his release from captivity.
The Vietnam War, also known as the Second Indochina War, and in Vietnam as the American War, occurred from 1959 to April 30, 1975. The term Vietnam Conflict is often used to refer to events which took place between 1959 and April 30, 1975. The war was fought between the Communist-supported Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the United States supported Republic of Vietnam. It concluded with the defeat and failure of the United States foreign policy in Vietnam. On April 30, 1975, the capital of South Vietnam, Saigon fell to the communist forces of North Vietnam, effectively ending the Vietnam War. Over 8.7 million U.S. forces participated in the Vietnam War; of whom slightly over 47,000 were killed in battle and almost 11,000 more died of non-battle causes.
During the Vietnam War three Asian Americans received the Medal of Honor, all of them posthumously. Elmelindo Smith, although wounded multiple times was killed while fighting with his unit. Terry Kawamura sacrificed his life by jumping on an explosive charge, saving the lives of two other soldiers, and Rodney Yano sacrificed his life by throwing burning ammunition off of a helicopter after a grenade exploded prematurely.

Richard Rodney Bennett

Sir Richard Rodney Bennett, CBE (29 March 193624 December 2012) was an English composer who was famous for his film music and his jazz performance as well as for music for the concert hall. He lived in New York City from 1979 until his death in 2012.
Richard Rodney Bennett was born at Broadstairs, Kent. He was very gifted as a child and had some private lessons with the composer Elisabeth Lutyens when he was 10. He studied at the Royal Academy of Music with Howard Ferguson, Lennox Berkeley and Cornelius Cardew. During this time, he went several times to Darmstadt where some of the most famous modern composers of the time met every summer to discuss ideas, particularly serialism.
Bennett taught at the Royal Academy of Music between 1963 and 1965, at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore, United States from 1970 to 1971, and was later International Chair of Composition at the Royal Academy of Music between 1994 and the year 2000.
Bennett wrote over two hundred works for the concert hall, and fifty scores for film and television. He also wrote and performed jazz songs. In the 1950s he studied in Paris with Pierre Boulez who encouraged him to write serial music, but later his music became more tonal and easier to listen to. He wrote jazz music, film music and concert music for the BBC Proms and the Three Choirs Festival. In 1976 he wrote "Zodiac" for the National Symphony Orchestra of Washington to celebrate the bicentenary of the United States of America. He dedicated the work to Elisabeth Lutyens. He started to give up serialism and combined various musical techniques to create his own personal style. In 1979 he moved to the United States.
A work called "Noctuary" (1980) combines the musical style of Scott Joplin with ideas from Schumann and Debussy. At the 1979 Edinburgh Festival he performed both with the horn player Barry Tuckwell who played his Horn Sonata as well as in late-night cabaret. His "Reflections on a Scottish Folk Song" was a tribute to the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. His music was extremely well written and some of the greatest musicians performed his music e.g. Barry Tuckwell, Julian Bream, Evelyn Glennie and James Galway and the singers Jane Manning, Robert Tear and Philip Langridge. In 2011 his suite of film music for "Murder on the Orient Express" was performed at the BBC Proms.
Richard Rodney Bennett died in New York on 24 December 2012.
He wrote music for films and television; among his scores were the "Doctor Who" story "The Aztecs" (1964) for television, and the feature film "Billion Dollar Brain" (1967). His scores for "Far from the Madding Crowd" (1967), "Nicholas and Alexandra" (1971), and "Murder on the Orient Express" (1974), each earned him Academy Award nominations, with "Murder on the Orient Express" gaining a BAFTA award. Later works include "Enchanted April" (1992), "Four Weddings and a Funeral" (1994), and "The Tale of Sweeney Todd" (1998). He also wrote many orchestral works, piano solos, choral works and operas.
Bennett was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1977, and was knighted in 1998.

Japanese spider crab

The Japanese spider crab ("Macrocheira kaempferi") is a species of marine crab, and is the only member in the genus Macrocheira. It is found only in the waters around Japan. The Japanese spider crab has the largest leg span of any arthropod in the world, reaching up to 3.8 meters (12 ft) long, and weighing up to 41 pounds (19 kg).
The Japanese spider crab has the largest leg span of any arthropod in the world, reaching up to 3.8 meters (12 ft) long, and weighing up to 41 pounds (19 kg), but the actual body of the Japanese spider crab is only 15 inches long. The Japanese spider crab has 8 legs and 2 arms used for feeding. Each feeding arm is 1.5 meters (5 ft) long. The Japanese spider crab is different from other crab species because the first pleopods (legs which help them swim, catch food, hold their eggs, and sometimes has gills on it) of the males are twisted, and its larvae are not very complicated organisms unlike other crab species larvae. It is orange in colour, with white spots on its legs. Although the Japanese spider crab has some ferocious appearances, it is actually known to be very gentle towards others. 
The Japanese spider crab is found in the Pacific side of the Japanese islands, Konshu and Kyushu, usually at a latitude between 30 and 40 degrees North. They are found usually in the Sagami, Suruga, and Tosa bays, as well as off the coast of the Kii peninsula. However, a Japanese spider crab was once found as far south as Su-ao, in eastern Taiwan. This is most likely a one time event; it is possible a fishing trawler or extreme weather may have carried this individual much further south than its home range. The Japanese spider crab is found up to the depths of 2,500 feet (750 meters). 
The Japanese spider crab is a scavenger, meaning it feeds mostly on dead animals, but it also feeds on shellfish, opening the shells with its giant claws to feed on them. After molting, these crabs will eat their own shell to get some important nutrients. It is one of the longest living creatures in the world, living up to 100 years.

John Shortland

Lieutenant John Shortland (1769-1810) was an English naval officer who explored and named the Hunter River in Australia.
Shortland joined the Royal Navy in 1781 as a midshipman. After served in Quebec and the West Indies. His father, Captain John Shortland (1739-1803), was the person in the Navy who organized many of the details for the First Fleet which took the first convicts to Australia in 1788. He arranged for two of his sons, John and Thomas George Shortland (1771 – 1827), to sail with him on the First Fleet. Shortland was the master's mate on "HMS Sirius" with Captain John Hunter. He was also on the ship when it was wrecked on Norfolk Island in 1790. He left Australia in 1792. 
In 1792, Shortland came back to Australia with Hunter. Hunter had been made Governor of New South Wales and Shortland was First Lieutenant on the "Reliance". Other officers on the ship were Matthew Flinders and George Bass. In 1797 Shortland found and named the Hunter River while searching for escaped convicts. He explored the area which is now the city of Newcastle. He made the first charts of the harbour. Shortland was given grants of land at Liberty Plains and Bankstown. He also served as a member of the Criminal Court in Sydney. He missed the excitement of navy life and in 1800 he returned to England on the "Reliance".
Shortland served in Egypt and then on the "Dolphin" and the "Trompeuse". He went to Guinea and after the death of its captain, became captain of the "Squirrel". In 1805 at Halifax he was made captain of the "Juno", a captured 40 gun French frigate. In 1809 he made a brave but unsuccessful attack on four French ships. The "Juno" was destroyed and Shortland died of his wounds. The French buried him with military honours at Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe.
The Newcastle suburb of Shortland, and the Division of Shortland - an electoral division in the Australian parliament were named after him. He was honoured with a postage stamp for the 150th anniversary but the artist made a mistake and it was Shortland's father's image on the stamp.

Peterhouse, Cambridge

Peterhouse is one of the colleges of the University of Cambridge, England. It was created in 1284 and is the oldest college. It is also one of the smallest ones, with less than 400 total students.
In 1280, Hugo de Balsham, the person who created the college, was first allowed to keep some students following the same rules of Merton College, Oxford. At first, they stayed where St John's College is now. Four years later, they bought some land near the Church of St Peter in Trumpington Street, where Peterhouse is still found now. Over the years, Peterhouse has been centre of many important events. It was here that many discussions about religion and the Protestant Reformation took place. Peterhouse was also the second building in England to get electricity, after the Palace of Westminster.
Some very important people have studied here. Four of them have won Nobel Prizes:

Robinson College, Cambridge

Robinson College is one of the colleges of the University of Cambridge, England. It was created in 1977 so it is the newest college in Cambridge. It allowed both men and women from the start. Today, it has about 550 students. The college was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1981. Because it is new, it does not have many of the traditions of the older colleges. For example, students can walk on the grass in the college gardens. 
It takes the name from David Robinson who gave £18 million to build the college. He also gave £3 million to build a new part of the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. The buildings are made of red brick and are found in Grange Road, a few minutes away from the city centre of Cambridge. 
Some important people have studied here, like Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

Barry Tuckwell

Barry Tuckwell (born 5 March 1931), is an Australian horn player who has spent most of his professional life in the United Kingdom and the United States.
Barry Tuckwell was born on 5 March 1931 in Melbourne. His younger sister Patricia is a violinist and fashion model widely known as Bambi. She married a photographer and later George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.
Tuckwell became a chorister at St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney where he studied the piano, organ, and violin. Then, at the age of 13, he started to learn the French horn. After six months he was playing it professionally. He studied at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music under Alan Mann, one of Australia's best known brass players.
At 15, he was given the job of third horn with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. A year later, he joined the Sydney Symphony Orchestra which was conducted by Eugene Goossens, where he remained for three and a half years before leaving for England. His first appointment in 1951 was with the Hallé Orchestra, conducted by Sir John Barbirolli. After two years, he went to the Scottish National Orchestra conducted by Karl Rankl and a year later to the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra conducted by Charles Groves. In 1955, he was appointed first horn with the London Symphony Orchestra.
He spent 13 years with the LSO, which is a co-operative orchestra (the players themselves make decisions about how the orchestra should be run). He was elected to the Board of Directors and was Chairman of the Board for six years. The chief conductors during this time were Josef Krips, Pierre Monteux, István Kertész and André Previn.
Tuckwell left the orchestra in 1968 and spent the rest of his career performing as a soloist and conductor. He became very famous, making 
over 50 recordings and receiving three Grammy Award nominations. In 1962 he formed a trio with Brenton Langbein (violin) and Maureen Jones (piano) for a performance of the Horn Trio by Don Banks, which was commissioned by the Edinburgh Festival. The trio played together for many years, playing music by Johannes Brahms, Charles Koechlin and others. He also played in a wind quintet and was known as a conductor.
Many composers have written works for Barry Tuckwell. They include concertos by Oliver Knussen, Don Banks, Gunther Schuller, Robin Holloway, and Thea Musgrave. Richard Rodney Bennett wrote "Acteon" for horn and large orchestra for him.
Barry Tuckwell has written three important books on the horn and horn playing. For the "Yehudi Menuhin Music Guides", he wrote the book on the horn. He wrote an excellent book on "Playing the Horn" as well as "Fifty First Exercises".
Tuckwell is famous for his teaching. He has been Artist-in-Residence at Dartmouth College and Pomona College in the USA, and he was Professor of Horn at the Royal Academy of Music in London from 1963 until 1974. He taught at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore in the 1980s and 1990s. He was Professorial Fellow at the University of Melbourne and has for several years hosted the annual Barry Tuckwell Institute at Colorado Mesa University in Grand Junction, Colorado.
Barry Tuckwell has received many honours, including the Order of the British Empire in 1965 and a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1992.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is a movie franchise. It is a fictional universe that is the setting of several superhero movies and TV shows made by Marvel Studios, based on characters by Marvel Comics. This shared universe was showed in the movies by using the same characters or mentioning the same events. For example, Tony Stark appears at the end of The Incredible Hulk, even though he has nothing to do with the rest of the story. This is the same way that the Marvel comic books were linked into the same universe.
The movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe have made a lot of money and become very popular, and the franchise has made the most money of all the movie franchises as of July 2015.
The movies in the MCU are organized in sections called Phases. So far, Phase 1 and 2 have been released. Phase 1 began in 2008 with the release of Iron Man and ended in 2012 with the release of The Avengers. Phase 2 began in 2013 with the release of Iron Man 3 and ended in 2015 with the release of Ant-Man. 10 more movies have been announced. These movies will be part of Phase 3.

George Sakato

George Taro Sakato (February 19, 1921 – December 2, 2015) was a United States Army soldier. He received the Medal of Honor because of his actions in World War II.
Sakato was born in Colton, California. His parents were immigrants from Japan. He was a "Nisei", which means that he was a second generation Japanese-American.
He graduated from Redlands High School in Redlands, California.
The Sakato family moved to Arizona during World War II to avoid internment.
Sakato joined the US Army in March 1944.
He volunteered to be part of the all-"Nisei" 442nd Regimental Combat Team. This army unit was mostly made up of Japanese Americans from Hawaii and the mainland.
For his actions in October 1944, Sakato was awarded the Army's second-highest decoration, the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). In the 1990s, there was a review of service records of Asian Americans who received the DSC during World War II. Sakato's award was upgraded to the Medal of Honor. In a ceremony at the White House on June 21, 2000, he was presented with his medal by President Bill Clinton. Twenty-one other Asian Americans also received the medal during the ceremony, but only seven of them were still alive.
Sakato's Medal of Honor recognized his conduct in fighting in northern France in 1944. He charged an enemy stronghold. Then he took command of his platoon and led it in defense of the position.
The words of Sakato's citation explain:
Private George T. Sakato distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action on 29 October 1944, on hill 617 in the vicinity of Biffontaine, France. After his platoon had virtually destroyed two enemy defense lines, during which he personally killed five enemy soldiers and captured four, his unit was pinned down by heavy enemy fire. Disregarding the enemy fire, Private Sakato made a one-man rush that encouraged his platoon to charge and destroy the enemy strongpoint. While his platoon was reorganizing, he proved to be the inspiration of his squad in halting a counter-attack on the left flank during which his squad leader was killed. Taking charge of the squad, he continued his relentless tactics, using an enemy rifle and P-38 pistol to stop an organized enemy attack. During this entire action, he killed 12 and wounded two, personally captured four and assisted his platoon in taking 34 prisoners. By continuously ignoring enemy fire, and by his gallant courage and fighting spirit, he turned impending defeat into victory and helped his platoon complete its mission. Private Sakato's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.
Sakato died in Denver, Colorado on December 2, 2015 at the age of 94.

Wim Crusio

Wim E. Crusio is a Dutch scientist working on the genetics of behavior and the nervous system. He is "directeur de recherche" (research director, a job title for a senior researcher) with the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Talence, France.
Crusio got in 1979 a master's degree and then in 1984 a Ph.D. from the Radboud University Nijmegen. He performed research in behavior genetics, plant taxonomy, and vegetation science for his master's degree. His revision of the genus "Anubias" continues to generate interest. His work in plant taxonomy continued for several more years. He wrote about the genus "Samolus". In 1986 he described a new species of the Aroid genus "Lagenandra", "L.dewitii". Crusio studied the inheritance of the behavior of mice exploring a new environment for his Ph.D. He also looked at the effects on this behavior of not being able to smell (anosmia). He used quantitative-genetic methods such as the diallel cross for this. Crusio worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Heidelberg from 1984 to 1987. This was supported by a NATO Science Fellowship and an Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellowship. Crusio spent the year 1988 in Paris (France) supported by a fellowship from the Fyssen Foundation. He returned to Heidelberg as a senior research scientist. He was then recruited as "chargé de recherche" by the CNRS. He worked at first in an institute of the Paris Descartes University (Paris V). He was promoted to research director in 1994. In 1997 he moved to the CNRS campus in Orléans. Crusio became professor of psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Massachusetts in 2000 and returned to the CNRS in 2005. He became a group leader in the "Centre de Neurosciences Intégratives et Cognitives" in Talence, a suburb of Bordeaux. He is currently adjunct director of the "Institut de Neurosciences Cognitives et Intégratives d'Aquitaine".
Animals will often explore a new environment if they have the chance. Crusio thought that this would be favorable: it would make it possible for animals to find water, food, etc. However, moving around in unfamiliar spaces is dangerous. Such stabilizing selection would leave genetic traces. Crusio did indeed find such traces for mice and for Paradise fish.
In Heidelberg, Crusio became interested in the inheritance of variations in the neuroanatomy of the mouse hippocampus. He studied the intra- and infrapyramidal mossy fiber (IIPMF) projections in this brain area. Crusio showed that about 50% of the variation found between different inbred mouse strains in the sizes of their IIPMF were due to genetic differences. Herbert Schwegler and Hans-Peter Lipp had found that these variations are correlated with learning a two-way active avoidance task. Animals with smaller projections learned much faster than animals with larger IIPMF. Together with Schwegler and Lipp, Crusio showed that an inverse correlation could be found for spatial learning in a radial arm maze task. Animals with larger IIPMF learned better in this task. Injecting mouse pups with thyroxine results in larger IIPMF projections. When mice from a strain with small IIPMF projections zere treated in this way, they could learn better in the radial maze. Crusio and his collaborators think that this correlation is causal. Not everybody believes this.
Mice that suffer unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) show symptoms that look like depression in humans. Researchers were thinking that deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis (the birth of new nerve cells) might be the cause of depression. Crusio and collaborators did experiments to look at changes in behavior and neurogenesis in stressed mice. They showed large changes in levels of aggression, anxiety, depressive-like behaviors, and learning. At the same time, there was a large drop in neurogenesis. The results dependent very much on the strain and sex. There did not appear to be a clear-cut correlation between the different changes. They concluded that their data do not support the idea that deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis alone are the cause of depression. However, they do not disprove this hypothesis either.
Crusio has recently looked into the possibility that "Fmr1" knockout mice can perhaps be used as a model for autism. The Fragile X syndrome is caused by a deficiency of the "FMR1" gene. Patients often show autistic symptoms. A good mouse model for the Fragile X syndrome is available because there are mice in which the "Fmr1" gene has been changed so that it does not work any more. A review of the work that has been done with these mice in many different laboratorie did indeed show that these animals have autistic-like symptoms. For example, they show changes in social behavior and this is a key symptom of autism.
Crusio is the founding editor-in-chief of "Genes, Brain and Behavior". This journal started in 2002 and has an impact factor of 4.061. This ranks it 63rd out of 237 listed journals in the Neurosciences category and 6th out of 48 listed journals in the Behavioral Sciences category. He and his co-editors developed standards for the publication of mouse mutant studies for this journal. These standards are gradually being accepted in the field. Crusio is an academic editor of "PLoS ONE" and served as associate editor of "Behavioral and Brain Sciences" (1991–2008) and "The ScientificWorldJournal" (2002-2011). Crusio serves or has served on the editorial boards of "Behavioral and Brain Functions, Behavior Genetics" (1991–1995), "Behavioural Brain Research" (1997–2007), "BMC Neuroscience", "BMC Research Notes, Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience, Journal of Visualized Experiments, Molecular Brain, Neurogenetics" (1998–2006), and "Physiology and Behavior". He edited special issues for the journals "Behavior Genetics", "Behavioural Brain Research", "Physiology and Behavior" (with Robert Gerlai), "Hippocampus" (with Aryeh Routtenberg), and "Brain Research Bulletin" (with Catherine Belzung and Robert Gerlai). He also edited a handbook on molecular genetic techniques for behavioral neuroscience together with Robert Gerlai. He is currently editing the "Cambridge Handbooks in Behavioural Genetics", a series of handbooks published by Cambridge University Press. The first volume, "Behavioral Genetics of the Mouse", will appear in 2013.
Crusio was one of two co-founders of the International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society in 1996 He served as member-at-large of the executive committee, treasurer, and president (1998–2001) of this society. He received from this society in 2011 the "Distinguished Service Award" for exceptional contributions to the field of behavioral neurogenetics. Crusio also served on the executive committees of the Behavior Genetics Association (from which he resigned in protest to Glayde Whitney's 1995 presidential address), the European Brain and Behaviour Society, and the International Behavioral Neuroscience Society (IBNS). Crusio has been a President of the Dutch Behavior Genetics Contact Group. He has been a member of several program committees for scientific meetings, most notably the 8th and 10th World Congresses of Psychiatric Genetics and the 2008, 2009 (co-chair), 2010 (chair), and 2011 (chair) Annual Meetings of the IBNS.

Fragmentation (computer)

Fragmentation is the name given to a phenomenon that can be observed when a partition or logical volume is used over a longer period of time. In general, such a volume has a common file system. When data is written, the file system will try to keep logical blocks together as much as possible, using free space on the file system when this is available. When this is not possible, a file will be split into parts, which will be written to the volume. As the file is not stored in one part, accessing it will take a little longer. A process that saves all the files in one part per file is called defragmentation.

Anonymus Valesianus

Anonym[o]us Valesianus is the name of a text, published by Henri Valois (1603-1676) in 1636. The text was published together with Res Gestae of Ammianus Marcellinus. The name is misleading: There are two texts, which have nothing in common, except the subject of history. They are labeled Anonymus Valesianus I and II. 
Anonymus Valesianus I, also called Origo Constantini talks about the life of Constantine the Great, roughly the time of 301 to 337 AD. The author is unknown, and was probably pagan. Most likely the text was written shortly after the death of the emperor. The author gives a good review of the life, and offers details which can be found in no other text. The text was written around 390, and is regarded as a reliable source
The second text gives a historic overview beginning with the reign of Julius Nepos. It ends with the death of Theodoric the Great, roughly 474-526. The author of the second text was probably Roman Catholic, and the text was written in Ravenna, which was very important at the time.The text was written after 526, probably between 550 and 560. It bears the heading "item ex libris Chronicorum inter cetera". The text mostly deals with the reign of the Gothic king in Italy, Theodoric the Great."(Even though it is) poorly written (the text) is based on a no longer (existing) chronicle by the bishop of Ravenna, Maximianus, a highly (learned) and knowledgable scholar".

Great Dividing Range

The Great Dividing Range, or the Eastern Highlands, is Australia's largest mountain range. It is the third longest land-based range in the world. The range is in length and runs along the whole east coast of Australia. In the north it starts from Dauan Island off the northeastern tip of Queensland. In Victoria the range turns west and ends at the Grampians in western Victoria. The width of the range varies from about to over .
The difference in height between the narrow coastal area and the eastern mountains has affected Australia's climate. This caused by the mountains causing lots of rain as clouds move over them. There are many gorges where the rise is steepest.
The Great Dividing Range is not a single mountain range. There is a complex of mountain ranges, plateaus, upland areas and escarpments. In some places the land is nearly flat, with only very low hills. The highlands range from to in height.
The Great Dividing Range is made of limestones, sandstone, quartzite, schists and metamorphic dolomite. Their shapes have been made by faulting and folding processes.
The crest of the range is the boundary between the drainage basins of rivers; those which drain east into the Pacific Ocean, or southward into Bass Strait; and those rivers which drain west and south into the Murray-Darling rivers. In the north, the rivers on the west side of the range drain towards the Gulf of Carpentaria.
The higher and more rugged parts of the "range" are not always part of the crest of the range. The term "Great Dividing Range" is used for both the watershed crest, and all of the hills and mountains between the east coast of Australia and the central plains and lowlands. At some places the Great Dividing Range can be up to wide. Most of the ranges and other features have their own names.
The Great Dividing Range was formed during the Carboniferous period, some 300 million years ago when the supercontinent Pangaea was forming. The range has eroded since then, and is now much lower than the more recent ranges such as the Alps and Himalayas. Its highest point is Mount Kosciuszko at 2,228 m (7,310 ft). 
Much of the range lies in national parks and other protected areas. Most of the national parks are listed below. There are also many more state forests.

Photochemistry

Photochemistry is the study of chemical reactions that go with light. There are many natural examples of such reactions. One is photosynthesis, which is a very important process through which plants form oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. Another is making vitamin D in the body.
Many times reactions go with heat: as you heat molecules, they start to move around and so hit other molecules which can then react. What molecules need is just some activation energy, a little energy to start the reaction. In the case of photochemistry, this energy is given by the light. A molecule or an atom absorbs at a certain wavelength. If light is given at this wavelength then the molecule or atom becomes excited. It is then easier for it to react.
Another way in which light can help reactions go is by changing the symmetry of a molecule. This can be tested with the Woodward–Hoffmann rules. Some pericyclic reactions go with heat, some go only with light.
In atmospheric chemistry, light is very important. This is because there is much more UV light at the top of the atmosphere. This allows reactions that don't happen on the ground. For example, ozone can split in an oxygen molecule and one oxygen atom.

Carl Stumpf

Carl Stumpf (21 April 1848 – 25 December 1936) was a German philosopher and psychologist. He is known for his impact on phenomenology, one of the most important philosophical trends of the twentieth century. 
He had an important influence on Edmund Husserl, the founder of modern phenomenology, as well as Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt Koffka, co-founders of Gestalt psychology. 
Stumpf was also one of the pioneers of musicology and ethnomusicology. He held positions in the philosophy departments at the Universities of Göttingen, Würzburg, Prague, Munich and Halle, before obtaining a chair (professorship) at the University of Berlin.
Stumpf began his "Tonpsychologie" (Tone psychology) in 1875, perhaps his greatest contribution to psychology. He distinguished between phenomena and mental functions, suggesting that phenomena such as tones, colours, and images are either sensory or imaginary. Stumpf termed the study of such phenomena as "phenomenology". He did a wide range of studies of the sounds of different instruments, melody, tonal fusion, and the consonance and dissonance of tones. 
In 1903 and 1904, Stumpf was involved in two public episodes about sensational phenomena. First, an engineer from Prague claimed to have invented a machine that could change photographs of sound waves into sound. Stumpf, after attending a demonstration, wrote an article challenging it, and it was never heard about again. However, the case of Clever Hans, an apparently brilliant horse owned by Herr von Osten, was even more sensational. The research done under his guidance disproved the idea that the animal understood language. It turned out that the horse was following subtle clues given unconsciously by its owner.

James Okubo

James K. Okubo (May 30, 1920 – January 29, 1967) was a United States Army soldier. He received the Medal of Honor because of his actions in World War II.
Okubo was born in Anacortes, Washington. His parents were Japanese immigrant parents. He was a "Nisei", which means that he was a second generation Japanese-American.
The Okubo family was interned at the Tule Lake War Relocation Center in California; and then they were moved to the camp at Hart Mountain in Wyoming.
Okubo joined the US Army in May 1943.
Okubo volunteered to be part of the all-"Nisei" 442nd Regimental Combat Team. This army unit was mostly made up of Japanese Americans from Hawaii and the mainland.
For his actions in October 1944, Okubo was awarded the Army's third-highest decoration, the Silver Star. In the 1990s, there was a review of service records of Asian Americans who received the Silver Star during World War II. Okubo's award was upgraded to the Medal of Honor. In a ceremony at the White House on June 21, 2000, he was presented with his medal by President Bill Clinton. Twenty-one other Asian Americans also received the medal during the ceremony, but only seven of them were still alive.
Okubo's Medal of Honor recognized his conduct in fighting in eastern France in 1944. many times, he exposed himself to intense fire to treat and evacuate wounded men.
The words of Okubo's citation explain:
Technician Fifth Grade James K. Okubo distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action on 28 and 29 October and 4 November 1944, in the Foret Domaniale de Champ, near Biffontaine, eastern France. On 28 October, under strong enemy fire coming from behind mine fields and roadblocks, Technician Fifth Grade Okubo, a medic, crawled 150 yards to within 40 yards of the enemy lines. Two grenades were thrown at him while he left his last covered position to carry back wounded comrades. Under constant barrages of enemy small arms and machine gun fire, he treated 17 men on 28 October and 8 more men on 29 October. On 4 November, Technician Fifth Grade Okubo ran 75 yards under grazing machine gun fire and, while exposed to hostile fire directed at him, evacuated and treated a seriously wounded crewman from a burning tank, who otherwise would have died. Technician Fifth Grade James K. Okubo's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.
Okubo is the namesake of the Okubo Family Health Clinic at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington.
The Okubo Barracks at the Fort Sam Houston in Texas are named after the "Nisei" soldier.

Automotive industry

The automotive industry refers to the design, manufacture, marketing and selling of motor vehicles. It is one of the world's biggest economic sectors in terms of the money it makes. The automotive industry began in the 1890s with hundreds of manufacturers making the "horseless carriage". The Ford Model T was one of the first cars to be sold for very little money. For a long time, the United States was the biggest producer of automobiles. In 1929, before the Great Depression, the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use. The U.S. automobile industry had produced over 90% of them. At that time, the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons. From the 1960s, Japan became the second biggest producer of automobiles in the world. China became the world leader in making automobiles in 2009.

<doc id="377621" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=377621" title="Tiffany Cross Medal of Honor">
Tiffany Cross Medal of Honor

The Tiffany Cross Medal of Honor was created immediately after World War I. The US Navy decided to recognize via the Medal of Honor two manners of heroism. One in combat and one in the line of a sailor's profession. The original upside-down star was designated as the non-combat version and a new pattern of the medal pendant, in cross form, was designed by the Tiffany Company in 1919. It was to be presented to a sailor or Marine who "in action involving actual conflict with the enemy, distinguish[es] himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty" and without detriment to his mission. This pendant became the "Tiffany Cross".
The "Tiffany Cross" is suspended from the classic light blue Medal of Honor ribbon with 13 white stars. At the ribbon top is a bar with the word "VALOUR". The medal is a gold cross pattée overlaying an oak and laurel wreath on the obverse side, with an antique anchor in each arm of the cross. The center, overlaying the cross, is an octagon with the phrases "UNITED STATES NAVY" to the top and "1917·1918" to the bottom, on the perimeter separated by two stars. The center of the octagon is the Great Seal of the United States. The reverse side is flat, suitable for engraving. Recipients medals often had intricate inscriptions.
On 4 February 1919 Congress, in the same act that created the Navy Cross and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, Congress provided:
Designed by Tiffany Company, this medal became the "Tiffany Cross" and eligibility was retroactive to 6 April 1917, when the United States entered World War I.
Despite the "actual conflict" guidelines, the "Tiffany Cross" was awarded to Floyd Bennett and Richard Byrd for arctic exploration, and to John Siegel for a rescue at sea. In the words of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, the "Tiffany Cross" Program was "poorly regulated and documented."
The "Tiffany Cross" was unpopular, perhaps because it so closely resembled the German Iron Cross. Recipients, such as Admiral Byrd, requested, received, and wore the classical inverted star design. Byrd received his "Tiffany Cross" on 27 February 1927 from President Coolidge. He received his classical Medal of Honor on 20 June 1930 from President Hoover. His motives for the change are not remarked upon. In 1942, the Navy returned to using only the original 1862 inverted 5-point star design, and ceased issuing the award for non-combat action.
During the "Tiffany Cross's" active status, the next lower naval award was the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, followed by the Navy Cross. By congressional action on 7 August 1942, in the same act that terminated the "Tiffany Cross", the Distinguished Service Medal and the Navy Cross swapped places, with the Navy Cross also becoming solely a combat award.
The US Naval History & Heritage Command asserts that 28 sailors and Marines received the "Tiffany Cross", but does not provide a list. However, a review of:
make a nearly complete list. There are at least three recipients (Byrd, Bennett, Siegal) who have been awarded the "Tiffany Cross" for non-combat actions. There may be other in-period recipients that have also have received one, but these aren't known, and would require investigation of similar nature for each.

The song was specifically made for Pete Tong's BBC Radio 1 Essential Selection show which deadmau5 was a guest on along with Steve Angello. Tong asked deadmau5 if deadmau5 could create something new for his appearance. deadmau5 said that the song was originally called "Hotel" because he made it for Tong's show when he was staying in his hotel. He also said that the song was "just now" finished and that he would now call it "Ghosts 'n' Stuff".
The music video for the song was shot in Toronto, Ontario and features Joel Zimmerman being rushed to the hospital but dies on arrival. Zimmerman is then revived as a ghost and roams the streets of Toronto where he gets a tattoo of a Space Invader alien, gets runs into a gang of ghosts and attends a rave where the other people are dressed up in different costumes. One of the people at the rave wearing a deadmau5 helmet pulls the white sheet off and Joel wakes up in the hospital. Joel also finds that the Space Invaders tattoo that he got as a ghost is still on his neck.
The music video for the song was also shown on a 2011 episode of Beavis and Butt-head titled, "Drones".

List of Jewish Medal of Honor recipients

The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War. It is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. A recipient must distinguish themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. The medal is presented to the recipient by the President of the United States on behalf of the Congress.
Since it was instituted there have been 3,473 recipients. At least 27 American Jews have received the Medal of Honor for their actions starting in the American Civil War through the Vietnam War. The first two recipients were Henry Heller and David Orbansky. Both received it for their actions in 1863 during the American Civil War. Samuel Gross was the only Jewish American Marine to receive the medal for his actions in Fort Riviere, Haiti. The last to receive it was Tibor Rubin in 2005. He was believed to have been overlooked due to discrimination. His medal was for his actions the Korean War in 1950. The medal was presetned 55 years before he received the medal.
Depending on religious definitions and varying population data, the United States currently has the second largest Jewish community in the world (after Israel). The American Jewish population was estimated to be approximately 5,128,000 (1.7%) of the total population in 2008 (304,060,000). However, it may be as high as 6,444,000 (2.2%). As a contrast, Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics estimated the Israeli Jewish population was 5,435,800 in 2007 (75.7% of the average population).
The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War. It is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The medal is bestowed "for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty, in actual combat against an armed enemy force" and the recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal it is commonly presented after the recipient has been killed (posthumously).
Until 1914 the Medal of Honor and the Purple Heart were the only medals that could be received. Prior to 1916 the criteria for the Medal of Honor were much less restrictive than it is today. In 1916 a board was established to ensure that future Medals of Honor would be made only for the highest purposes. The board determined some Medals that had been given out should be taken back.
Since the institution of the Medal of Honor, at least 27 have been presented to American Jews. Four received the medal posthumously.
The American Civil War was a major conflict fought between the federal government of the United States and eleven of its member States. They sought to secede and to create their own government. It was called the Confederate States of America. It started on April 12, 1861, shortly after Abraham Lincoln was elected President of the United States. It ended four years later on April 9, 1865. During the war over 10,000 military engagements took place and more than 3 million people fought on both sides. Forty percent of the battles were fought in the states of Virginia and Tennessee.
Since its creation, 1522 have received the Medal of Honor for actions during the American Civil War. Depending on sources, as many as seven were Jewish.
Indian Wars is the name generally used in the United States to describe a series of conflicts between the colonial or federal government and the native people of North America. The wars ranged from the 17th-century to the early 1900s. These wars generally resulted in the opening of Native American lands to further colonization.It included the conquest of American Indians and their assimilation. It often also included forced relocation to Indian reservations.
According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), "The Indian wars under the government of the United States have been more than 40 in number. They have cost the lives of about 19,000 white men, women and children, including those killed in individual combats, and the lives of about 30,000 Indians."
From the time the Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War, through the end of the Indian Wars there were 426 recipients who received it for actions in one of the Indian Wars. This included four American Jews. The first to receive it was Simon Suhler who received it under the name Charles Gardner. The next two were David Goodman and George Geiger. The last Jew to receive the medal for the Indian wars was Jacob Trautman. He received it for his actions in the battle now frequently referred to as the Wounded Knee Massacre.
The Philippine-American War was an armed military conflict between the United States and the First Philippine Republic. It was fought from 1899 to at least 1902. This war arose from a Filipino political struggle against U.S. occupation of the Philippines. While the conflict was officially declared over on July 4, 1902, American troops continued hostilities against remnants of the Philippine Army and other resistance groups until 1913. Some historians consider these unofficial extensions part of the war.
During the Philippine-American War 86 members of the American military received the Medal of Honor. The only American Jew to received it was Private Louis C. Mosher. He received it for risking his life while rescuing a wounded soldier from enemy fire.
In 1900 the United States dispatched American troops to China as part of a multinational force. It was sent to quell a rebellion that was endangering the lives of citizens from several countries. The conflict would become known as the Battle of Peking, or as the Boxer rebellion. After the battle, 59 Medals of Honor were presented for actions throughout the event. William Zion from Indiana was the only American Jew to receive the medal during this conflict.
In 1915 Haiti saw several bloody changes in Government leadership. The result was an unstable and dangerous environment for American citizens, business and interests. A citizen led revolt overthrew and killed the brutal new dictator General Vilbrun Guillaume Sam within 6 months of seizing power. President Woodrow Wilson ordered the United States Marines to restore order and protect American property and lives. When the Marines arrived they began engaging the rebel Cacos and in a battle that ended at Fort Riviere, Haiti. It resulted in hand to hand combat and the Cacos were eliminated. After the battle six Marines received the Medal of Honor for their actions. These Marines included Dan Daly, Smedley Butler and the only Jewish Marine to ever receive the Medal, Samuel Marguiles. He received it under the name Samuel Gross.
When World War I broke out, the United States initially maintained a policy of isolationism. They avoided conflict while trying to negotiate peace between the warring nations. When a German U-boat sank the British liner "Lusitania" in 1915 there were 128 Americans aboard. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson vowed that "America isn't too proud to fight". He demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. Germany complied and Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. He repeatedly warned that the U.S. would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law. In 1917, three years after the first shots of the war were fired, the United States entered the war. By the end of the conflict more than 4.7 million American soldiers, sailors and Marines would fight in the war.
More than 250,000 Jewish Americans served in the armed forces during the war. More than 3,000 killed in action and another 12,000 being gassed or wounded.
One hundred twenty four people would eventually receive the Medal for their actions during the war. Seven of them were Jewish. One of them was William Sawelson. He received it posthumously when he was killed by a machine gun attempting to assist another injured soldier. Lieutenant Edouard Izac was captured by a German submarine after it sank the ship he was on. He was then taken prisoner and brought aboard where he gathered information about German submarine movements. He realized the importance of the information and determined he must escape. For his first escape attempt he jumped from a moving train. He was recaptured and sent to a prison camp. On his second attempt he successfully escaped the prison camp and made his way through the mountains of southwestern Germany. He swam the Rhine River at night with German sentries nearby.
During World War II 16.1 million American service members served. It is estimated 650,000 of them were Jewish American men and women. More than 50,000 American Jews received medals during the war including five Medals of Honor.
Among the recipients were three Jewish Americans, Isadore S. Jachman, Ben L. Salomon and Raymond Zussman who all received it posthumously. Jachman and Salomon were both killed attempting to assist other fallen soldiers. Zussman's medal was received for risking his life on September 12, 1944. He was killed less than a month later before receiving it.
Korea was split into the two separate countries of North and South, Korea along the 38th parallel. Tensions between the two countries worsened when other countries began to get involved on both sides. The communist country of North Korea was supported by Russia, China and others. The democratic South was supported by the United Nations and the United States. In 1950 the United States got involved and over the next three years more than 1.5 million US service members would serve in Korea. During the three years of the war 133 Medals of Honor were presented. Although more than 150, 000 Jewish American men and women were serving in Korea at that time, not one received the Medal of Honor.
On July 23, 1950 Tibor Rubin was serving as a rifleman in Korea when his unit was forced to retreat. He was ordered to stay behind and keep the road open for the withdrawing unit. During the 24-hour battle he single-handedly fought off an overwhelming number of North Korean troops. He inflicted severe casualties on the attacking unit and assisted in the capture of many prisoners. A few months later Chinese forces staged a night-time assault on his unit and Rubin manned a machine gun allowing the unit to retreat southward. He again inflicted heavy casualties on the attacking unit. During the battle he was severely wounded and was eventually captured by Chinese forces. Although the Chinese offered to release him early and return him to his native Hungary, he refused. He remained a prisoner and risked his life repeatedly by sneaking out at night to get food and medical supplies for other wounded prisoners.
A 1993 study commissioned by the United States Army investigated racial discrimination in the awarding of medals. During the investigation it was determined that one Veteran American Jew and Holocaust survivor, Tibor Rubin, had been the subject of discrimination due to his religion and should have received the Medal of Honor. In 2005, 55 years later, President George W. Bush presented the Medal of Honor to Rubin in a ceremony at the White House, for his actions in 1950 during the Korean War.
The Vietnam War was a military conflict between the Communist-supported Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the United States-supported Republic of Vietnam. It started in 1959 and concluded April 30, 1975 with the defeat and failure of the United States foreign policy in Vietnam.
During the Vietnam War, 246 Medals of Honor were received, 154 of them posthumously. Two American Jews received the Medal, Jack H. Jacobs from the Army and John Levitow from the Air Force.

Ted Tanouye

Ted Takayuki Tanouye (November 14, 1919 – September 6, 1944) was a United States Army soldier. He received the Medal of Honor because of his actions in World War II.
Tanouye was born in Torrence, California. His parents were Japanese immigrant parents. He was a "Nisei", which means that he was a second generation Japanese-American.
The Tanouye family was interned at the Jerome War Relocation Center near Jerome, Arkansas. and then they were moved to the camp at Rohwer War Relocation Center near Rohwer, Arkansas.
Two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Tanouye joined the US Army in February 1942.
Tanouye volunteered to be part of the all-"Nisei" 442nd Regimental Combat Team. This army unit was mostly made up of Japanese Americans from Hawaii and the mainland.
For his actions in July 1944, Tanouye was awarded the Army's second-highest decoration, the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). In the 1990s, there was a review of service records of Asian Americans who received the DSC during World War II. Tanouye's award was upgraded to the Medal of Honor. In a ceremony at the White House on June 21, 2000, he was presented with his medal by President Bill Clinton. Twenty-one other Asian Americans also received the medal during the ceremony, but only seven of them were still alive.
Tanouye's Medal of Honor recognized his conduct in fighting in northern Italy in 1944. Without the help of others, he attacked a series of enemy positions.
The words of Tanouye's citation explain:
Technical Sergeant Ted T. Tanouye distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action on 7 July 1944, near Molino A Ventoabbto, Italy. Technical Sergeant Tanouye led his platoon in an attack to capture the crest of a strategically important hill that afforded little cover. Observing an enemy machine gun crew placing its gun in position to his left front, Technical Sergeant Tanouye crept forward a few yards and opened fire on the position, killing or wounding three and causing two others to disperse. Immediately, an enemy machine pistol opened fire on him. He returned the fire and killed or wounded three more enemy soldiers. While advancing forward, Technical Sergeant Tanouye was subjected to grenade bursts, which severely wounded his left arm. Sighting an enemy-held trench, he raked the position with fire from his submachine gun and wounded several of the enemy. Running out of ammunition, he crawled 20 yards to obtain several clips from a comrade on his left flank. Next, sighting an enemy machine pistol that had pinned down his men, Technical Sergeant Tanouye crawled forward a few yards and threw a hand grenade into the position, silencing the pistol. He then located another enemy machine gun firing down the slope of the hill, opened fire on it, and silenced that position. Drawing fire from a machine pistol nest located above him, he opened fire on it and wounded three of its occupants. Finally taking his objective, Technical Sergeant Tanouye organized a defensive position on the reverse slope of the hill before accepting first aid treatment and evacuation. Technical Sergeant Tanouye's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.
Tanouye is the namesake of the Torrance National Guard Armory in California.

The recipients must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal it is commonly presented after the recipient has been killed (posthumously).
During the Vietnam War 248 Medals of Honor were received of which 156 of them were presented posthumously. Soldiers of the Army received the most with 161. Fifty seven went to the Marines and 16 to the Navy. The remaining 14 went to the Air Force. The first medal of the war was presented to Roger Donlon for rescuing and administering first aid to several wounded soldiers and leading a group against an enemy force. The first African American recipient of the war was Milton L. Olive, III who sacrificed himself to save others by smothering a grenade with his body. Riley L. Pitts was killed after attacking an enemy force with rifle fire and grenades and was the first African American commissioned officer of the war to receive the medal. Thomas Bennett was a conscientious objector who received the medal for his actions as a medic; three chaplains received the medal, including Vincent R. Capodanno, who served with the Marine Corps and was known as the Grunt padre.
The unknown soldier from the Vietnam War who was buried in the Tomb of the Unknowns was authorized a Medal of Honor and in 1998 was identified as 1st Lieutenant Michael Blassie. After DNA testing confirmed his identity, the remains were removed from the tomb and returned to Blassie's family, but the Medal of Honor remained as a tribute to those veterans still unknown. The Blassie family requested that the Medal of Honor be granted to him but the request was denied by the Department of Defense.

Eastern bluebird

The eastern bluebird ("Sialia sialis") is a species of Turdidae. Its name comes from the colour of its feathers, which is a vibrant blue.
There is a marked contrast between his blue back and its subdued orange-brown belly. The female's colours are less intense. The head's colour is a kind of blue-gray and there is a more vibrant blue on the tail and the wings. The belly is a mix of orange-brown and white. The male is completely blue. It is only his breast and his throat which are orange and blue, his belly and undertail are white. 
The eastern bluebird lives in many regions of North America. It has been seen more frequently in the American Midwest and in southern Canada. It does not have a definive habitat. It lives in light woods, gardens, agricultural areas and orchards. This species prefers to use a hole already made as a nest. In fact, those birds often live in deserted woodpecker holes. To make it more comfortable they add to the hole little twigs or brushwood. They cut and bring it back to the hole they want to live in and it covers the bottom of the wood cavity. 
This bird eats insects. In summer and spring time, perching on a low branch or on a nest boxes, it searches for prey. When it finds one it simply attacks it. During colder seasons, bugs are less present. Thus, it can also eat little fruits like field or forest berries.
Females have between four and five eggs at a time. Before hatching, there is about fourteen days of incubation. The eastern bluebird has been decreasing in population over time. Despite the fact that many eggs are laid, the birth's success rate is low. One thing that can be the source of that phenomenon might be the introduction of the common starling from Europe. That kind of bird is a strong competitor fighting against eastern bluebirds for natural cavities. If they are fighting every day females would not be able to lay their eggs because they need a calm location to do it. However, the situation could be worse without nest boxes to help eastern bluebirds find a safe location.

List of African-American Medal of Honor recipients

The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War. It is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. Recipients must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Because of the nature of this medal it is commonly presented after the recipient has been killed (posthumously).
Of the 3,464 Medals of Honor received , 88 have been awarded to 87 different African American recipients. Robert Augustus Sweeney is one of nineteen men, and the only African American, to have been awarded two Medals of Honor.
A 1993 study commissioned by the Army investigated racial discrimination in the awarding of medals. At the time, no Medals of Honor had been presented to black soldiers who served in World War II. After an exhaustive review of files, the study recommended that several black Distinguished Service Cross recipients be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. On January 13, 1997, President Bill Clinton awarded the Medal to seven African American World War II veterans; of these, only Vernon Baker was still alive.
Twenty-five African Americans earned the Medal of Honor during the American Civil War. Included were seven sailors of the Union Navy, fifteen soldiers of the United States Colored Troops, and three soldiers of other Army units. Fourteen African American men earned the Medal for actions in the Battle of Chaffin's Farm, where a division of U.S. Colored Troops saw heavy action. Another four men, all sailors, earned their Medals at the Battle of Mobile Bay. William Harvey Carney was the first African American to perform an action for which a Medal of Honor was awarded, but Robert Blake was the first to actually receive the Medal (Blake's was issued in 1864, Carney did not receive his until 1900). It was common for Civil War Medals of Honor to be awarded decades after the conflict ended; in one case, Andrew Jackson Smith's Medal was not awarded until 2001, 137 years after the action in which he earned it. Smith's wait, caused by a missing battle report, is the longest delay of the award for any recipient, African American or otherwise.
Eighteen African Americans earned the Medal of Honor during the Indian Wars of the western United States. Fourteen were "Buffalo Soldiers", members of the Army's first peacetime black regiments. The four Buffalo Soldier regiments, the 9th Cavalry, 10th Cavalry, 24th Infantry, and 25th Infantry, fought in campaigns throughout the west. The remaining four Medal of Honor recipients were U.S. Army Indian Scouts recruited from among the Black Seminoles, a group of Seminole Indians of African descent.
Six African Americans earned the Medal of Honor during the Spanish-American War: five Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry Regiment and one United States Navy sailor. Four of the five Buffalo Soldiers received the Medal for rescuing a trapped landing party during the Battle of Tayacoba.
Freddie Stowers was the only African American to receive the Medal of Honor for actions in World War I. Stowers had led an assault on German trenches, continuing to lead and encourage his men even after being twice wounded. Stowers died of his wounds, and was shortly afterwards recommended for the Medal of Honor; however, this recommendation was never processed. In 1990, the Department of the Army conducted a review and the Stowers recommendation was uncovered. An investigation was launched, and based on results of the investigation the award of the Medal of Honor was approved. Stowers' Medal of Honor was presented on April 24, 1991—seventy-three years after he was killed-in-action.
No African American was awarded a Medal of Honor either during World War II or immediately afterwards with respect to their actions during that conflict. This changed in 1992 when a study conducted by Shaw University and commissioned by the U.S. Dept. of Defense and the United States Army asserted that systematic racial discrimination had been present in the criteria for awarding medals during the war. After an exhaustive review of files the study recommended that several of the Distinguished Service Crosses awarded to African Americans be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. On January 13, 1997, more than fifty years after the end of the war, President Bill Clinton awarded the Medal to seven African American World War II veterans. Vernon Baker was the only living recipient—the other six men had been killed in action or died in the intervening years.
Two African Americans received the Medal of Honor for action in the Korean War, both were soldiers of the 24th Infantry Regiment. Despite a 1948 Executive Order commanding the integration of the military, segregated units persisted until 1954; the 24th Infantry was one of the last remaining all-black regiments, and these two men were the last African Americans to receive the Medal of Honor for actions while serving in a segregated unit.
Twenty African Americans were awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in the Vietnam War, including James Anderson, Jr., the first African American Marine to receive the Medal.
Before World War II, the Medal of Honor could be awarded for actions not involving direct combat with the enemy; eight African Americans earned the Medal in this way, all of them sailors. Robert Augustus Sweeney received two peacetime Medals of Honor, one of only nineteen men, and the only African American, to be awarded the medal twice. Most of the non-combat medals, including both of Sweeney's, were awarded for rescuing or attempting to rescue someone from drowning.

List of Medal of Honor recipients

The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War. It is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal it is commonly presented after the recipient has been killed (posthumously).
The President of the United States, in the name of the United States Congress, has awarded 3,471 Medals of Honor to the nation's soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and coast guardsmen since the decoration's creation in 1861. The citations highlighting these acts resided in archives, some for more than 100 years and were only sporadically printed. In 1973, the U.S. Senate ordered the citations compiled and printed as Committee on Veterans' Affairs, U.S. Senate, Medal of Honor recipients: 1863–1973 (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1973). This book was later updated and reprinted in 1979.
The first Army Medal of Honor was awarded to Private Jacob Parrott during the American Civil War for his role in the Great Locomotive Chase. The first African American recipient for this award was William Harvey Carney who, despite being shot in the face, shoulders, arms, and legs, refused to let the American flag touch the ground. The only female Medal of Honor recipient is Mary Edwards Walker, a Civil War surgeon. Her medal was rescinded in 1917 along with many other non-combat awards, but it was restored by President Jimmy Carter in 1977.
While current law, (United States Code Title 10), beginning in 1918, explicitly state that recipients must be serving in the U.S. Armed Forces at the time of performing a valorous act that warrants the award, exceptions have been made. For example, Charles Lindbergh, while a reserve member of the U.S. Army Air Corps, received his Medal of Honor as a civilian pilot. In addition, the Medal of Honor was presented to the British Unknown Warrior by General Pershing on October 17, 1921; later the U.S. Unknown Soldier was reciprocally awarded the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest award for gallantry, on November 11, 1921. Although being a U.S. citizen is not a prerequisite for eligibility to receive the medal, apart from a few exceptions, Medals of Honor can only be awarded to members of the U.S. armed forces. Sixty-one Canadians who were serving in the United States armed forces have received the Medal of Honor; most received it for actions in the American Civil War. Since 1900, only four have been awarded to Canadians. In the Vietnam War, Peter C. Lemon was the only Canadian recipient of the Medal of Honor.
The American Civil War (1861–1865) was an undeclared war between the United States (the Union) and the Southern states of the newly formed Confederate States of America under Jefferson Davis. The Medal of Honor was established during this conflict; 1522 were awarded (32 posthumously) for acts of bravery and gallantry in combat. Almost half of all of the awarded Medals of Honor were presented for actions in the Civil War.
The term Indian Wars is the name generally used in the United States to describe a series of conflicts between colonial or federal governments and the American Indian population resident in North America before the arrival of white settlers. During this conflict the Medal of Honor was presented to 426 soldiers, 13 posthumously for acts of bravery and gallantry in combat.
The United States expedition to Korea in 1871, also known as "Sinmiyangyo" ("Western Disturbance of the Year Sinmi year"), was the first American military action in Korea. It took place predominantly on and around the Korean island of Ganghwa. The reason for the presence of the American military expeditionary force in Korea was to support an American diplomatic delegation sent to establish trade and diplomatic relations with Korea and to ascertain the fate of the "General Sherman" merchant ship. The isolationist nature of the Joseon Dynasty government and the assertiveness of the Americans led to an armed conflict between the two parties. Eventually, the United States failed to secure its objectives.
The Spanish-American War (Spanish: "Guerra Hispano-Estadounidense", "desastre del 98", "Guerra Hispano-Cubana-Norteamericana" or "Guerra de Cuba ") was a military conflict between Spain and the United States that began in April 1898. Hostilities halted in August of that year, and the Treaty of Paris was signed in December. The war began after the American demand for Spain's peacefully resolving the Cuban fight for independence was rejected, though strong expansionist sentiment in the United States may have motivated the government to target Spain's remaining overseas territories: Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Guam and the Caroline Islands.
Riots in Havana by pro-Spanish "Voluntarios" gave the United States reason to send in the warship . This action by the U.S. indicated high national interest. Tension among the American people was raised because of the explosion of the USS "Maine", and "yellow journalism" that accused Spain of extensive atrocities, agitating American public opinion. The war ended after decisive naval victories for the United States in the Philippines and Cuba. The Treaty of Paris ended the conflict 109 days after the outbreak of war giving the United States ownership of the former Spanish colonies of Puerto Rico, the Philippines and Guam.
The Samoan Civil War is a Western definition of political activity in the Samoa Islands of the South Pacific in the late 19th century. By this non-Samoan definition, the Samoan Civil Wars were a series of wars between Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, ending in the partitioning of the island chain in 1899. The concluding event was the Second Samoan Civil War. The first Samoan Civil War lasted for eight years. The warring Samoan parties were supplied arms, training and sometimes even combat troops by Germany, Britain and the United States. These three powers valued Samoa as a refueling station for coal fired shipping. In addition, these countries sought to gain more power in Europe and wanted Samoa due to the scarcity of unclaimed territory from 1870 onwards.
The Philippine-American War was an armed military conflict between the United States and the First Philippine Republic, fought between 1899 to at least 1902, which arose from a Filipino political struggle against U.S. occupation of the Philippines. While the conflict was officially declared over on July 4, 1902, American troops continued hostilities against remnants of the Philippine Army and other resistance groups until 1913, and some historians consider these unofficial extensions part of the war.
Eighty-six men were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions in the Philippine–American War: 70 from the Army, 10 from the Navy, and 6 from the Marine Corps. Four of the awards were posthumous. Among the recipients were Webb Hayes, the son of former U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes, and two prominent Marine Corps officers, Hiram I. Bearss and David Dixon Porter. Bearss became known for leading long-range reconnaissance patrols behind enemy lines and was later wounded as a colonel in World War I. Porter was from a distinguished military family and rose to become a major general. José B. Nísperos, a member of the Philippine Scouts who was honored for continuing to fight after being wounded, was the first Asian recipient of the Medal of Honor.
The Boxer Movement or Boxer Rebellion, which occurred in China from November 1899 to September 7, 1901, was an uprising by members of the Chinese Society of Right and Harmonious Fists against foreign influence in areas such as trade, politics, religion and technology that occurred in China during the final years of the Manchu rule (Qing Dynasty). The members of the Society of Right and Harmonious Fists were simply called "boxers" by the Westerners due to the martial arts and calisthenics they practiced. The uprising began as an anti-foreign, anti-imperialist peasant-based movement in northern China. They attacked foreigners who were building railroads and violating Feng shui, as well as Christians, who were held responsible for the foreign domination of China. In June 1900, the Boxers invaded Beijing and killed 230 non-Chinese. Tens of thousands of Chinese Christians, Catholic and Protestant alike, were killed mostly in Shandong and Shanxi Provinces as part of the uprising. The government of Empress Dowager Cixi was not helpful, and diplomats, foreign civilians, soldiers and some Chinese Christians retreated to the legation quarter where they held out for fifty-five days until a multinational coalition rushed 20,000 troops to their rescue. The Chinese government was forced to indemnify the victims and make many additional concessions. Subsequent reforms implemented after the crisis of 1900 laid the foundation for the end of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the modern Chinese Republic.
During the Boxer rebellion, 59 American servicemen received the Medal of Honor for their actions. Four of these were for Army personnel, twenty-two went to navy sailors and the remaining thirty-three went to marines. Harry Fisher was the first Marine to receive the medal posthumously and the only posthumous recipient for this conflict.
The United States occupation of the Mexican port of Veracruz lasted for six months in response to the Tampico Affair of April 9, 1914. The incident came in the midst of poor diplomatic relations between Mexico and the United States, related to the ongoing Mexican Revolution.
Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels ordered that 56 Medals of Honor be awarded to participants in the occupation of Veracruz, the most for any single action before or since. In total 63 Medals of Honor were received for actions during the occupation; 1 Army, 9 to members of the United States Marine Corps and 53 to Navy personnel.
The first United States occupation of Haiti began on July 28, 1915 and ended in mid-August 1934.
The United States occupied the Dominican Republic from 1916 to 1924. In May 1917, Rear Admiral William Caperton forced Arias to leave Santo Domingo by threatening the city with naval bombardment. U.S. Marines invaded and took control of the country within two months; in November that same year, the U.S. imposed a military government. The Marines restored order throughout most of the republic (with the exception of the eastern region); the country's budget was balanced, its debt was diminished, and economic growth resumed; infrastructure projects produced new roads that linked all the country's regions for the first time in its history; a professional military organization, the Dominican Constabulary Guard, replaced the partisan forces that had waged a seemingly endless struggle for power.
World War I, also known as the First World War and the Great War, was a global military conflict which took place primarily in Europe from 1914–1918. Over 40 million casualties resulted, including approximately 20 million military and civilian deaths. Over 60 million European soldiers were mobilized from 1914–1918. The immediate cause of the war was the June 28, 1914 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb citizen of Austria-Hungary and member of the Black Hand. The retaliation by Austria-Hungary against Serbia activated a series of alliances that set off a chain reaction of war declarations. Within a month, much of Europe was in a state of open warfare.
During this War, 119 men received the Medal for their actions, 33 of them posthumously.
The United States occupied Nicaragua from 1909 to 1933 and intervened in the country several times before that. The American interventions in Nicaragua were designed to prevent the construction of a trans-isthmian canal by any nation but the USA. Nicaragua assumed a quasi-protectorate status under the 1916 Chamorro-Bryan Treaty. The occupation ended as Augusto César Sandino, a Nicaraguan revolutionary, led guerrilla armies against US troops. Furthermore, the onset of the Great Depression made it costly for the USA to maintain occupation.
World War II, or the Second World War, was a global military conflict. The conflicts joined from two separate conflicts. The first began in Asia in 1937 as the Second Sino-Japanese War; the other began in Europe in 1939 with the German and Russian invasion of Poland. This global conflict split the majority of the world's nations into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. It involved the mobilization of over 100 million military personnel, making it the most widespread war in history, and placed the participants in a state of "total war", erasing the distinction between civil and military resources. This resulted in the complete activation of a nation's economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities for the purposes of the war effort. Over 60 million people, the majority of them civilians, were killed, making it the deadliest conflict in human history. The worldwide financial cost of the war is estimated at a trillion 1944 U.S. dollars, making it the most costly war both in capital expenditures as well as loss of lives.
During this conflict 464 United States military personnel received the Medal of Honor, 266 of them posthumously. A total of 42 Medals of Honor, representing 9% of all awarded during World War II, were presented for action in just two battles – 15 for actions during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and 27 for actions during the Battle of Iwo Jima. A total of 21 (4.5% of all World War II Medals of Honor) were awarded to members of the all-Japanese American 100th Infantry Battalion of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, for actions in numerous battles across six different campaigns. Additionally, the only Medal of Honor ever presented to a member of the United States Coast Guard was received for actions during this war.
The Korean War was ignited by the 1950 invasion of South Korea when the North Korean Army moved south on June 25, 1950 to attempt to reunite the Korean peninsula, which had been formally divided since 1948. The conflict was then expanded by the United States, China's and the Soviet Union's involvement. The main hostilities were during the period from June 25, 1950, until the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed on July 27, 1953.
In South Korea, the war is often called "6•25", or the 6•25 War (Korean: 6•25 전쟁), from the date of the start of the conflict or, more formally, "Hanguk Jeonjaeng" literally “Korean War”. In North Korea, while commonly known as the Korean War, it is formally called the Fatherland Liberation War. In the early days of the war, United States President Harry Truman called the United Nations response a "police action". The war is sometimes called "The Forgotten War" because it is a major conflict of the 20th century that gets less attention than World War II, which preceded it, and the controversial Vietnam War, which succeeded it. In China, the conflict was known as the War to Resist America and Aid Korea, but is today commonly called the "Korean War".
During this war, 135 Medals of Honor were presented for bravery in action, 97 of them posthumously.
The Vietnam War, also known as the Second Indochina War, and in Vietnam as the American War, occurred from 1959 to April 30, 1975. The term "Vietnam Conflict" is often used to refer to events which took place between 1959 and April 30, 1975. The war was fought between the Communist-supported Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) and the United States supported Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam).
During the Vietnam War, 246 Medals of Honor were received, 154 of them posthumously. Soldiers of the Army received the most with 160, followed by 57 to the Marines, 16 to the Navy and the remaining 13 to the Air Force. The first medal of the war was presented to Roger Donlon for rescuing and administering first aid to several wounded soldiers and leading a group against an enemy force. The first African American recipient of the war was Milton L. Olive, III who sacrificed himself to save others by smothering a grenade with his body. Riley L. Pitts was killed after attacking an enemy force with rifle fire and grenades and was the first African American commissioned officer of the war to receive the medal. Thomas Bennett was a conscientious objector who received the medal for his actions as a medic; three chaplains received the medal, including Vincent R. Capodanno, who served with the Marine Corps and was known as the Grunt Padre.
The USS "Liberty" incident was an attack on a neutral United States Navy technical research ship, USS "Liberty", by Israeli jet fighter planes and motor torpedo boats on June 8, 1967, during the Six-Day War. The combined air and sea attack killed 34 and wounded more than 170 crew members, and damaged the ship severely.
The Battle of Mogadishu (also referred to as the "Battle of the Black Sea") or for Somalis "Ma-alinti Rangers" (“The Day of the Rangers”) was a battle that was part of Operation Gothic Serpent that was fought on October 3 and 4, 1993, in Mogadishu, Somalia, by forces of the United States supported by UNOSOM II against Somali militia fighters loyal to warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. The battle is also referred to as the First Battle of Mogadishu to distinguish it from the Second Battle of Mogadishu in 2006. The Medals were awarded to two DELTA operatives who volunteered to attempt to save the pilot of one of the downed UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, despite facing hundreds, possibly thousands of rebels.
The War in Afghanistan, which began on October 7, 2001, was launched by the United States, the United Kingdom, and NATO allies in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks. It was the beginning of the War on Terrorism. The stated purpose of the invasion was to capture Osama bin Laden, destroy al-Qaeda, and remove the Taliban regime which had provided support and safe harbor to al-Qaeda. Since 2001, six American service-members have received the Medal of Honor for actions in Afghanistan, three of them posthumously. Army Sergeant First Class Jared C. Monti received his medal for attempting to rescue a wounded soldier at the cost of his own life. Navy Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy received his for actions against insurgent forces and for sacrificing his life to call for help when his team had been overwhelmed by a much larger enemy force. Army Staff Sergeant Robert James Miller's surviving family was presented with his medal on October 6, 2010. The fourth recipient, Salvatore Giunta received his for his actions in 2007 when he risked his life to save a wounded comrade. He is the first living recipient since the Vietnam War. A second living recipient, Sergeant First Class Leroy Petry, received the medal from President Obama during a July 12, 2011, ceremony. Marine Corps Corporal Dakota Meyer became the third living recipient awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Ganjgal.
The Iraq War, also known as the Second Gulf War, Operation Iraqi Freedom ("US"), Operation TELIC ("UK") or the occupation of Iraq, was a conflict which began on March 20, 2003 with the United States-led invasion of Iraq by a multinational coalition composed of U.S. and U.K. troops supported by smaller contingents from Australia, Poland, and other nations. Four service members have received the Medal of Honor for actions in Iraq; two from the Army, one from the Marine Corps and one from the Navy. Paul R. Smith was the first to receive it for his actions on April 4, 2003 when he held enemy forces back, allowing other wounded soldiers to be evacuated to safety. The other three, Corporal Jason Dunham of the Marine Corps, Specialist Ross A. McGinnis of the Army and Master-at-Arms Second Class Michael A. Monsoor of the Navy received it after being killed while using their own bodies to smother grenades to protect their comrades.
Before World War II, the Medal of Honor could be received for actions not involving direct combat with the enemy and 193 men earned the medal in this way. Most of these medals were presented to members of the United States Navy for rescuing or attempting to rescue someone from drowning. One of those awarded the Medal of Honor for rescuing others was Fireman Second Class Trinidad, who as of 2010 has been the only Asian American Sailor to be awarded the Medal of Honor. In addition to the medals that were presented for lifesaving acts, one Medal of Honor was presented to William Halford who sailed in a small boat for 31 days to get help for the other members of the USS "Saginaw" who had been stranded on an island. Three explorers were also presented with the medal by special acts of Congress. Charles Lindbergh received the medal for flying the first solo non-stop flight across the Atlantic Ocean as well as Floyd Bennett and Richard Evelyn Byrd who received it for their participation in what was thought to be the first successful heavier-than-air flight to the North Pole and back. One recipient, Adolphus W. Greely received his for a lifetime of military service.
While current law, ("e.g.", United States Code Title 10 (relating to service members in the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps), beginning in 1918, explicitly states that recipients must be serving in the U.S. Armed Forces at the time of performing a valorous act that warrants the award, exceptions have been made. Apart from these rare exceptions, Medals of Honor can only be awarded to members of the U.S. Armed Forces, although being a U.S. citizen is not a prerequisite. Sixty-one Canadians who were serving in the United States Armed Forces have been awarded the Medal of Honor, with a majority awarded for actions in the American Civil War. Since 1900, only four have been awarded to Canadians. In the Vietnam War, Peter C. Lemon was the only Canadian recipient of the Medal of Honor.
The Medal of Honor has also been presented to several unknown soldiers: the British Unknown Warrior in the United Kingdom by General Pershing on October 17, 1921; later the U.S. Unknown Soldier was reciprocally awarded the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest award for gallantry, on November 11, 1921. The Medal of Honor was also presented to the Romanian Unknown Soldier, the Unknown Soldier of France, entombed under the Arc de Triomphe, the Unknown Soldier of Belgium and the Unknown Soldier of Italy, entombed in the Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II.

José B. Nísperos

José B. Nísperos (December 30, 1887–September 1, 1922) was a member of the Philippine Scouts. He received the Medal of Honor during the Philippine-American War. He was the first Asian to receive the medal. On September 24, 1911, at Lapurap, Basilan, Philippines, Nísperos, a member of the U.S. Army's 34th Company of the Philippine Scouts, defended his unit's position against natives armed with spears despite being severely wounded. Nísperos became the first Filipino and Asian to receive the medal of honor; the medal was presented by Brigadier General Bell in February 1913.
Citation:
Having been badly wounded (his left arm was broken and lacerated and he had received several spear wounds in the body so that he could not stand) continued to fire his rifle with one hand until the enemy was repulsed, thereby aiding materially in preventing the annihilation of his party and the mutilation of their bodies.

Telesforo Trinidad

Telesforo de la Crux Trinidad (November 25, 1890-May 8, 1968) was a Filipino fireman 2nd class in the United States Navy who received the Medal of Honor for actions, in Mexican waters near La Paz, on board the USS San Diego in peacetime. He was the second service member, and first and so far the only sailor of Asian descent to receive the award.
Citation:
For extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession at the time of the boiler explosion on board the U.S.S. San Diego, 21 January 1915. Trinidad was driven out of fireroom No. 2 by the explosion, but at once returned and picked up R.E. Daly, fireman, second class, whom he saw to be injured, and proceeded to bring him out. While coming into No. 4 fireroom, Trinidad was just in time to catch the explosion in No. 3 fireroom, but without consideration for his own safety, passed Daly on and then assisted in rescuing another injured man from No. 3 fireroom. Trinidad was himself burned about the face by the blast from the explosion in No. 3 fireroom.

Terry Teruo Kawamura

Terry Teruo Kawamura (December 10, 1949 – March 20, 1969) was a United States Army soldier. He was also a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration—the Medal of Honor. He received it for his actions in the Vietnam War.
Kawamura was born at Wahaiwa, Hawaii on the island of Oahu. His grandparents were Japanese immigrant parents. Kawamura was a "Sansei", which means that he was a third generation Japanese-American.
Kawamura joined the Army from Oahu in 1968. By March 20, 1969, was serving as a Corporal in the 173rd Engineer Company, 173rd Airborne Brigade. On that day, at Camp Radcliff, Republic of Vietnam, Kawamura smothered an enemy-thrown explosive with his body, sacrificing his life to protect those around him.
Kawamura was 19 when he died. He was buried in Mililani Memorial Park in Mililani Town, Hawaii.
Kawamura's Medal of Honor recognized his conduct in fighting in Vietnam in 1969. He smothered the blast of an explosive charge with his body.
The words of Kawamura's citation explain:
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. Cpl. Kawamura distinguished himself by heroic action while serving as a member of the 173d Engineer Company. An enemy demolition team infiltrated the unit quarters area and opened fire with automatic weapons. Disregarding the intense fire, Cpl. Kawamura ran for his weapon. At that moment, a violent explosion tore a hole in the roof and stunned the occupants of the room. Cpl. Kawamura jumped to his feet, secured his weapon and, as he ran toward the door to return the enemy fire, he observed that another explosive charge had been thrown through the hole in the roof to the floor. He immediately realized that 2 stunned fellow soldiers were in great peril and shouted a warning. Although in a position to escape, Cpl. Kawamura unhesitatingly wheeled around and threw himself on the charge. In completely disregarding his safety, Cpl. Kawamura prevented serious injury or death to several members of his unit. The extraordinary courage and selflessness displayed by Cpl. Kawamura are in the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.
Tanouye is the namesake of the Kawamura Gate which connects Wheeler Army Airfield with the city of Mililani. This east gate is named in honor of Kawamura.

Common raven

The common raven ("Corvus corax"), also known as the northern raven, is a large, all-black passerine bird. Found across the northern hemisphere, it is the most widely distributed of all corvids. There are at least eight subspecies with little variation in appearance—although recent research has demonstrated significant genetic differences among populations from various regions. It is one of the two largest corvids, alongside the thick-billed raven, and is possibly the heaviest passerine bird; at maturity, the common raven averages 63 centimetres (25 inches) in length and 1.2 kilograms (2.6 pounds) in mass.

Dutch defence

The Dutch defence is one of the oldest chess openings. It aims at counter-attacking the white K-side in the middlegame. White responds in various ways:
2.g3. This fianchetto of the KB signals White's attempt to control the central squares. It is the main line for tournament players. White continues with moves like Bg2, Nf3, 0-0, c4, Nc3.
2.Bg5. This is a hard move to understand. It makes 2...Nf6 doubtful, since 3Bxf6 doubles pawns and makes Black's game more difficult. Black usually plays 2...g6 to fianchetto his bishop before he plays ...Nf6. 2...g6 marks the Leningrad variation of the Dutch defence. The bishop cannot be chased successfully: 2...h6 3.Bh4 g5 4.Bg3 f4? 5.e3! threatens mate, and so wins the pawn on f4.
2.e4. This is Staunton's Gambit. After 2...fxe4 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 d5 5f3 White may or may not have enough for the f pawn.

St Catharine's College, Cambridge

St Catharine's College is one of the colleges of the University of Cambridge, England. It is often called just Catz by the students. It was created in 1473 by Robert Wodelarke, who was the Provost (head) of King's College. At the beginning, the rules were that people could only study theology or philosophy but this changed with time. It now has about 600 students.
St Catharine's College takes its name from Catherine of Alexandria. She is the patron for learning in Christianity. The mother of King Henry VI was also called Catherine, so it is possible that the name comes from there. 
At the beginning, there was not much money for the college. There were also few students and Fellows (teachers). Over time though numbers went up. They had to make new buildings to let more students join the college. The modern first court, which only has three sides, was built between 1675 and 1757. In 1880, people started to think about joining St Catherine's College back with King's College, since they are right next to each other. However, this did not happen because the Master did not agree in the end.
Some important people have studied here, like Ian McKellen, an actor.

Manfredini was born in Pievepelago, Modena, Emilia-Romagna. She moved to Des Moines, Iowa in 1920 with her husband Riccardo Manfredini, whom she raised four children with. She worked in an ammunition factory during World War II and cleaned houses until she was 90. Her husband died at the age of 79 in 1965, when she was 67. After her husband's death she lived alone until moving into a nursing home at the age of 110. 
On the morning of 17 December 2012, at around 9:30am, Manfredini died from natural infection at the age of 115 years, 257 days. Three of her children were still living at the time of her death, as well as 7 grandchildren, 7 great-grandchildren and 12 great-great-grandchildren.

Rodney Jamus Takahashi Yano (December 13, 1943 – January 1, 1969) was a United States Army soldier. He received the Medal of Honor because of his actions in the Vietnam War.
Yano was born in Hawaii. His grandparents were Japanese immigrant parents. Yano was a "Sansei", which means that he was a third generation Japanese-American.
Yano joined the Army from Honolulu, Hawaii in 1963, When he died in January 1969, he was as a Sergeant First Class in the Air Cavalry Troop, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment.
He was age 25 at his death. He was buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, Honolulu, Hawaii.
Yano's Medal of Honor recognized his conduct in fighting in Vietnam in 1969. He grabbed burning ammunition and threw it from the aircraft after being seriously wounded by a grenade explosion aboard a helicopter.
The words of Yano's citation explain:
Sfc. Yano distinguished himself while serving with the Air Cavalry Troop. Sfc. Yano was performing the duties of crew chief aboard the troop's command-and-control helicopter during action against enemy forces entrenched in dense jungle. From an exposed position in the face of intense small arms and antiaircraft fire he delivered suppressive fire upon the enemy forces and marked their positions with smoke and white phosphorus grenades, thus enabling his troop commander to direct accurate and effective artillery fire against the hostile emplacements. A grenade, exploding prematurely, covered him with burning phosphorus, and left him severely wounded. Flaming fragments within the helicopter caused supplies and ammunition to detonate. Dense white smoke filled the aircraft, obscuring the pilot's vision and causing him to lose control. Although having the use of only 1 arm and being partially blinded by the initial explosion, Sfc. Yano completely disregarded his welfare and began hurling blazing ammunition from the helicopter. In so doing he inflicted additional wounds upon himself, yet he persisted until the danger was past. Sfc. Yano's indomitable courage and profound concern for his comrades averted loss of life and additional injury to the rest of the crew. By his conspicuous gallantry at the cost of his life, in the highest traditions of the military service, Sfc. Yano has reflected great credit on himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.
Yano is the namesake of the USNS "Yano" (T-AKR-297), a Shughart class cargo ship. She is a 'roll-on roll-off' non-combat United States Navy designated a "Large, Medium-speed, roll-on/roll-off" (LMSR) ship.
Yano Fitness Center at Camp Zama, Japan and Yano Hall Helicopter Maintenance Facility at Fort Rucker, Alabama are named in his honor.

The college is found northwest of the city of Cambridge. It has about 450 students. At the beginning, it mainly had Roman Catholic students because it was built a short time after they were allowed back again in the University. Now it has a very international feeling. It was only in 1998 that St Edmund's was given full college status. Before, it was only considered a "House of Residence" by the University.

First Lieutenant

First lieutenant is a military rank in many armed forces. They are considered commissioned officers and in some militaries an appointment.
The rank of lieutenant has different meanings in different military formations. In the majority of cases it is common for it to be sub-divided into a senior (first lieutenant) and junior (second lieutenant) rank. In navies it may relate to a particular post rather than a rank.
In the United States Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps, a first lieutenant is a junior commissioned officer. It is just above the rank of second lieutenant and just below the rank of captain. It is equivalent to the rank of lieutenant (junior grade) in the other uniformed services.
In the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard, first lieutenant is a position title, instead of a rank. It is held by the officer in command of the deck department. On smaller ships, the first lieutenant holds the rank of lieutenant, junior grade or ensign. On larger vessels, the position is held by a lieutenant or, in the case of extremely large warships such as aircraft carriers, a lieutenant commander or even commander. However, on submarines, where the deck department may only have a few junior sailors, the first lieutenant may be a senior enlisted member, such as a first-class petty officer or chief petty officer.

Air Force Instruction

An Air Force Instruction (AFI) is a documented instruction for members of the United States Air Force. It is intended for use by active duty, guard, and reserve members and associated civilians. It is one of many forms of directives published by the Air Force Departmental Publishing Office (AFDPO). In almost all cases, an Air Force Instruction is a form of a general order; and violation of the AFI by an Airman subject to it can be punished under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

Acanthostega

Acanthostega (meaning 'spiny roof') was an extinct fishapod. It was one of the first vertebrates to have recognizable limbs. It appeared in the Upper Devonian about 365 million years ago, and was anatomically intermediate between lobe-finned fishes and the first tetrapods fully capable of coming onto land.
"Acanthostega" had eight digits on each hand linked by webbing, and six digits on the rear legs. It had no wrists to support the animal's weight on land. "Acanthostega" also had a remarkably fish-like shoulder and forelimb. The front foot of "Acanthostega" could not bend forward at the elbow, and so could not bear the full weight of the body. It was suitable for paddling or for holding on to aquatic plants. The animal had lungs, but its ribs were too short to give support to its chest cavity out of water. It had gills which were internal and covered like those of fish, not external and naked like those of some modern aquatic amphibians. 
There are many changes that allowed the pelvic girdle of "Acanthostega" to become a weight-bearing structure. In ancestral states the two sides of the girdle were not attached. In "Acanthostega" there in contact between the two sides and fusion of the girdle with the sacral rib of the vertebral column. These fusions would have made the pelvic region more powerful and equipped to counter the force of gravity when not supported by the buoyancy of water. 
Therefore, paleontologists think it probably lived in shallow, weed-choked swamps, the legs adapted to some other function than walking on land. Also, there is a change in the arrangement of teeth from previous types. At that period, for the first time, deciduous plants were flourishing and annually shedding leaves into the water, attracting small prey into warm oxygen-poor shallows which were difficult for larger fish to swim in. Both "Ichthyostega" and "Acanthostega" may heve breathed air by sticking their heads above the water in these shallows.
Clack remarks on how the lower jaw of "Acanthostega" shows a change from the jaws of fish. It differs in having a small number of larger teeth in the outer row and smaller teeth in the inner row. Research based on analysis of the skull suggests the species may have bitten directly on prey at or near the water's edge. Markey and Marshall compared the skull with the skulls of fish, which use suction feeding as the main way to catch prey, and creatures known to have used the direct biting typical of terrestrial animals. Their results indicate that "Acanthostega" was adapted for what they call terrestrial-style feeding. This strongly supports the hypothesis that the terrestrial mode of feeding first emerged in aquatic animals. If correct, this shows an animal specialized for hunting and living in shallow waters in the line between land and water. Newer research also indicates that it is possible "Acanthostega" evolved from an ancestor that had more terrestrial adaptations than itself.
fragments of the skull had been discovered in 1933 by Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh and Erik Jarvik. The famous fossil which showed the significance of this species was discovered by Jenny Clack in East Greenland, 1987. 
"Acanthostega" is part of widespread evolutionary adaptive radiation in the late Devonian period. It started with purely aquatic finned tetrapodomorphs. Their successors did more air-breathing, had adaptions to the jaws and gills. They had a more muscular neck allowing freer movement of the head than fish have, and used their fins to raise the body of the fish. These features are seeen in the earlier "Tiktaalik", which like the "Ichthyostega" and "Acanthostega" is thought to have been primarily aquatic.

Factor (medicine)

A risk factor in medicine is something that causes, or helps to cause, a medical condition. 
For example, smoking or breathing in somebody else's tobacco smoke (called second-hand smoke) is a risk factor for emphysema and lung cancer. 
A trigger factor causes the symptoms of a medical condition to begin in a person who already has that medical condition. Example: Smoking or breathing in someone else's smoke can be a trigger factor for asthma. The person already had asthma but the smoke caused an asthma attack.

Landman (rank)

Landman (or, in the United States Navy, Landsman) was a military rank given to naval recruits.
In the middle of the 18th century (c.1757) the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom used the term Landman. This referred to a seaman with less than a year's experience at sea. After a year, the Landman was usually promoted to the rank of Ordinary Seaman. 
Most were acquired by impressment (a common method of recruitment from c.1700-1815). Landmen were usually between the ages of 16 and 35. While seasoned sailors (who started as Ordinary Seamen) could be impressed up to the ages of 50 to 55 depending on need. In 1853 the practice of impressment ended after the passing of the Continuous Service Act. The rank's title was changed to Apprentice Seaman. The term Landman evolved into a more formal rating for a seaman assigned to unskilled manual labor.
Landsman was the lowest rank of the United States Navy in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was given to new recruits with little or no experience at sea. Landsmen performed basic unskilled work aboard ship. A Landsman who gained three years of experience or re-enlisted could be promoted to Ordinary Seaman. The rank existed from 1838 to 1921.

Ordinary seaman (rank)

Ordinary seaman is a military rank used in naval forces.
The term Ordinary seaman was used in the Royal Navy in the middle of the 18th century. The term was used to refer to a seaman with between one and two years' experience at sea. They showed enough seamanship to be so rated by their captain. A seaman with less than a year's experience was referred to as a landman. A sailor with more than two years' experience was referred to as an able seaman.
Later, the term was formalized as a rating for the lowest normal grade of seaman. They are not trained in any special task. They are required to work at physically hard tasks of great variety. One needs an Ordinary Seaman Certificate to obtain work. One can become an able seaman as a promotion from this position.
Ordinary seaman was the second-lowest rank of the 19th century United States Navy. It ranked above landsman and below seaman. Promotion from landsman to ordinary seaman required three years of experience or re-enlistment. An ordinary seaman who gained six years of experience and knew the name and use of every line in the ship's rigging, could be promoted to seaman. An ordinary seaman's duties aboard ship included "handling and splicing lines, and working aloft on the lower mast stages and yards."
The rank existed from 1797 to 1917, when it was renamed "seaman second class". Seaman second class was later changed to the modern-day rank of seaman apprentice. The related ranks of ordinary seaman second class and ordinary seaman, engineer's force, existed in 1876–1885 and 1871–1883, respectively.
The term "ordinary seaman" is currently used in the Royal Canadian Navy and Irish Naval Forces (who inherited the military ranking structure from the previous generation of Royal Navy, Army, and Air Force ranks.)

Gunner's mate

The United States Navy occupational rating of gunner's mate (GM) is given by the Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS) to enlisted sailors. They must either complete school training or by showing they are familiar with the field of ordnance.
The Gunner's Mate school is held at Naval Training Center Great Lakes, Illinois. The school was originally very hands-on. It is now primarily conducted through self-study computer-based training (CBT). The training focuses on the operation, maintenance, and troubleshooting of Naval guns, missile launchers, and torpedoes. It has a strong emphasis on basic explosives, guidance and tracking systems, small arms, Naval ammunition classification, and safety. Upon completion of this school enlisted members often continue on to a specialized school. At the specialized school they learn a particular weapons system.
A GM will specialize in weapons such as the M500 shotgun, M60 machine gun, M14 rifle, M2 Browning machine gun, M9 pistol, M11 pistol, M16 rifle, M240 machine gun, M203 grenade launcher, M79 grenade launcher, M1911 pistol, M1 Garand, Mk 19 grenade launcher, Mk 18 Mod 0 Carbine Rifle, 5"/54 caliber Mark 45 gun, M242 Bushmaster chain gun, Vertical launching system, Missiles, , pyrotechnics, hand grenades, non-lethal weapons, force protection & anti-terrorism, as well as operating shooting ranges, armories, and the storage and issue of ammunition.

Between March 1870 and August 1872, "Benicia" served on the Asiatic Station. It took part in Rear Admiral John Rodgers' expedition to Korea (16 May-11 June 1871). During this period Ordinary Seaman John Andrews, Chief Quartermaster Patrick H. Grace and Private Michael McNamara, USMC, received the Medal of Honor.
Following repairs at Mare Island Navy Yard, "Benicia" joined the North Pacific Squadron 6 December 1872. She cruised in Mexican, Central American, and Hawaiian waters and arrived at San Francisco, California on 29 November 1874 carrying King Kalākaua of Hawaii and his suite. 
Captain of the Mizzen Top Albert Weisbogel also received the Medal of Honor (his first award) for service on "Benicia", in 1874.
"Benicia" made a cruise to Alaska (11 May-21 July 1875) and was decommissioned at Mare Island 29 November 1875. "Benicia" was sold 3 May 1884.

, Wai is the only Chinese American and the first Asian-American officer to receive the medal.
Wai was the child of a Native Hawaiian mother and a Chinese father. Growing up, he often surfed with Duke Kahanamoku regarded as the father of surfing. He also surfed with Buster Crabbe who later became an actor. He attended the Punahou School in Honolulu where he earned athletic letters in track, football and baseball. He went to college at the Sacramento Junior College before transferring to UCLA. At UCLA, he was a four sport athlete and graduated in 1939 with a Bachelor's Degree in Banking and Finance. He intended to work alongside his father in real estate and banking but instead joined the military upon the outbreak of World War II.
After his graduation from college Wai enlisted in the Hawaii National Guard. He was called to active duty before the United States' entrance into World War II. He received a commission as an officer and completed Officer Candidate School in 1941. His commission was rare at a time when few Asian-Americans were allowed to serve in combat leadership roles. He was eventually assigned to the 34th Infantry Regiment of the 24th Infantry Division with the rank of Captain. The 24th Division, based at Schofield Barracks, Oahu, was among the first American units to be involved in the Pacific Theater. They exchanged fire with Japanese aircraft during the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.
In May 1943 Captain Wai deployed to Australia with the 24th Infantry Division. By September 19, 1943 the unit was at Camp Caves, near Rockhampton. It is on the eastern coast of Australia. Wai and the rest of the unit began intensive combat training. With training completed, the division moved to Goodenough Island on January 31, 1944, to prepare for Operation Reckless. That was the name of the amphibious invasion of Hollandia, Netherlands New Guinea (now Jayapura, in the Papua province of Indonesia).
The 24th landed at Tanahmerah Bay on April 22, 1944. They seized the Hollandia Airdrome despite torrential rain and marshy terrain. Shortly after the Hollandia landing, the division's 34th Infantry Regiment moved to Biak. They went to reinforce the 41st Infantry Division. Wai's regiment captured the Sorido and Borokoe airdromes before returning to the division on Hollandia in July. In two months, Wai and his unit had crossed New Guinea and recaptured three airdromes from the Japanese.
After occupying the Hollandia area, Wai was assigned to X Corps of the Sixth United States Army in preparation for the invasion of the Philippines. On October 20, 1944, his division was paired with the 1st Cavalry Division within X Corps. The two divisions made an assault landing at Leyte. When Captain Wai landed at Red Beach, the Japanese forces stationed on the island focused their fire on the waves of incoming troops. The Japanese fired from gun positions in a palm grove in the middle of submerged rice paddies. When Wai arrived on the beach in the fifth wave, he found the soldiers there to be leaderless, disorganized, and pinned down on the open beach. Assuming command, he moved through the rice paddies, without cover. His demeanor and example inspired the other men to follow him. Without thinking of his own personal safety, he moved forward without cover to draw Japanese machine gun and rifle fire. This allowed him to identify the locations of the entrenched Japanese forces. Systematically, the Japanese positions were assaulted and overcome. Wai was killed leading an assault against the last Japanese pillbox in the area. For his actions during the landing on Leyte, Wai was posthumously presented the Distinguished Service Cross. After the war, his remains were interred at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. His grave is in section Q, grave 1194.
In 1996 there were allegations of prejudicial treatment of Asian Americans in uniform in World War II. Congress directed Louis Caldera, then Secretary of the Army, to conduct a full review of military records. The review concluded that 22 Asian Americans, including Wai, did not receive full consideration for the Medal of Honor. In 2000 Wai's Distinguished Service Cross was upgraded to the Medal of Honor. Of those whose medals were upgraded, Wai was one of only two who did not belong to the predominantly Japanese American 442nd Regimental Combat Team/100th Infantry Battalion; the other being Rudolph B. Davila of the 7th Infantry. At a White House ceremony June 20, 2000, President Bill Clinton presented the Medal of Honor to 22 Asian Americans whose Distinguished Service Crosses were upgraded to the Medal of Honor.
During the course of his short military career, Wai earned eight awards and decorations.
Citation:
Captain Francis B. Wai distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action, on 20 October 1944, in Leyte, Philippine Islands. Captain Wai landed at Red Beach, Leyte, in the face of accurate, concentrated enemy fire from gun positions advantageously located in a palm grove bounded by submerged rice paddies. Finding the first four waves of American soldiers leaderless, disorganized, and pinned down on the open beach, he immediately assumed command. Issuing clear and concise orders, and disregarding heavy enemy machine gun and rifle fire, he began to move inland through the rice paddies without cover. The men, inspired by his cool demeanor and heroic example, rose from their positions and followed him. During the advance, Captain Wai repeatedly determined the locations of enemy strong points by deliberately exposing himself to draw their fire. In leading an assault upon the last remaining Japanese pillbox in the area, he was killed by its occupants. Captain Wai's courageous, aggressive leadership inspired the men, even after his death, to advance and destroy the enemy. His intrepid and determined efforts were largely responsible for the rapidity with which the initial beachhead was secured. Captain Wai's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army."

It is named after "Narcissus", a figure in Greek mythology who fell in love with his own reflection.
In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, NPD is defined as "habitual grandiosity (showing off), need for admiration and lack of empathy".

Specialist (rank)

Specialist (abbreviated "SPC") is one of the four junior enlisted ranks in the U.S. Army. It is just above Private First Class and equivalent in pay grade to Corporal. Unlike Corporals, Specialists are not considered junior non-commissioned officers (NCOs).
On 1 July 1955 four grades of Specialist were established. The first was Specialist Three (E-4). It is the only one that still exists. But it is now known a Specialist Four. Specialist Two (E-5), Specialist One (E-6), and Master Specialist (E-7) were also created in 1955. These were all eventually replaced with other titles. In 1958 the DoD added two additional pay grades. This gave enlisted soldiers more opportunities to progress to a full career. These were Specialist Eight (E-8) and Specialist Nine (E-9) which were abolished in 1968. All except SP4 were abolished in 1984 when SP4 was renamed as "Specialist" and abbreviated as "SPC".

Curriculum

A curriculum (plural: curricula) is a program of study. It is used to plan teaching or training. It spells out the details so others can know what is going to happen:
Today it usually means the courses, their content, and the coursework offered at a school or university. Often, curricula are backed by some kind of theory, or by intending to change what was done before. Curricula may be backed by textbooks and by courses to train teachers. The study of curricula is part of most qualifications for teachers.
A similar word is syllabus, which means a summary of topics which will be covered during an academic course, or book or lecture. Another term is discipline, which in this sense means an academic subject-matter. 
Historically, curricula have done more than act as a background for syllabi and examinations. They have discussed the basis of teaching by taking account of:
The four questions asked by Tylor in his introductory text are generally regarded as fundamental: 
There are no hard-and-fast rules for answering those questions. There have always been different theories of education which are based on different attitudes to education and to life itself. Roughly speaking, these theories have two opposite ends. At one end is child-centered education. This is concerned to adapt the teaching to the needs and development of individual children, and is most used in kindergarten and primary education. The other end is society-oriented. It aims to make sure society gets a steady supply of young adults able to fill the jobs and roles which society needs to be filled. In some countries the approach would be more religion-oriented. This would aim to produce young adults whose main aim is to live according to the precepts (beliefs, practices) of a particular religion.

Otto was a powerful noble of Saxony and Eastern Germany for a long time. His sister Liutgard was married to King Louis the Younger. Around the 890s, his daughter Oda married Zwentibold, King of Lotharingia.
In 911, the East Frankish King Louis the Child died without any children. German nobles said that Otto should be crowned as king, but he declined (said no) because of his old age. He instead recommended Conrad to Franken, his powerful political rival. In 918, his son Henry I the Fowler was appointed as King.

Per &quot;Dead&quot; Ohlin

Per Yngve Ohlin (16 January 1969 – 8 April 1991) was a Swedish black metal musician best known for performing with the band Mayhem under the stage name Dead. 
He was given the name "Dead" after a near-death experience when his spleen ruptured after being beat up by bullies and was clinically dead for a while. He became fascinated with death and dying afterwards and received his name.
He was also a founding member of the death metal band Morbid and performed with them on their "December Moon" demo.
He was described by Jan Axel "Hellhammer" Blomberg, the drummer for Mayhem, as being "a very strange personality ... depressed, melancholic, and dark" and guitarist Øystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth said "I honestly think Dead is mentally insane. Which other way can you describe a guy who does not eat, in order to get starving wounds? Or who has a T-shirt with funeral announcements on it?"
Dead's mental state began to take a turn for the worse due to his fascination with death and his social situation. Because of this, he would usually cut himself while performing on stage with either a broken bottle or a blade. Euronymous was fascinated with Dead's suicidal tendencies and would encourage Dead to kill himself often. Varg Vikernes sent shotgun shells to Dead in 1991. On 8 April 1991, In the house he shared with Euronymous, he slit his throat and wrists with a knife and then shot himself in the forehead with a shotgun. His suicide note said that he was sorry for shooting himself indoors and he ended the note with "Excuse all the blood". Euronymous returned home and had to climb through an open window because all the doors to the house were locked. He found Dead's body but before he called the police, he went to a nearby shop and bought a disposable camera which he used to photograph Dead's body after he moved around some of the items. He also kept some pieces of Dead's shattered skull. Hellhammer developed the pictures and Euronymous said that he would later destroy the pictures but he never did. He kept the pictures in an envelope at his record shop Helvete instead and sent one of the pictures to the owner of Warmaster Records which used the picture of Dead's body as the cover art for Mayhem's 1995 bootleg live album "Dawn of the Black Hearts". The other band members were disgusted at Euronymous' actions before and after Dead's death and Bassist Necrobutcher decided that he wasn't going to be friends with him anymore.
He was ranked #48 out of "50 of The Greatest Metal Frontmen of All Time" by Roadrunner Records.

During March 1924, at McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio, Lieutenant Doolittle, piloting a Fokker PW-7 pursuit airplane, performed a series of acceleration tests requiring skill, initiative, endurance, and courage of the highest type. In these test a recording accelerometer was mounted in the airplane and the accelerations taken for the following maneuvers. Loops at various air speeds; single and multiple barrel rolls; power spirals; tail spins; power on and power off; half loop, half roll, and immelman turn; Inverted flight; pulling out of dive at various air speeds; flying the airplane on a level course with considerable angle of bank; and flying in bumpy air. In these test the airplane was put through the most extreme maneuvers possible in order that the flight loads imposed upon the wings of the airplane under extreme conditions of sir combat might, be ascertained. These test were put through with that fine combination of fearlessness and skill which constitutes the essence of distinguished flying. Through them scientific data of great and permanent importance to the Air Corps were obtained.

Inca Civil War

The Inca Civil War, the Inca Dynastic War, or the Inca War of Succession, was a civil war in the Inca Empire. It was fought between two brothers, Huáscar and Atahualpa, sons of Huayna Capac, over who would be the next emperor. The war came after Huayna Capac's death in 1527, and lasted from 1529 until 1532. When their father died, the empire was divided between the two brothers. Huáscar got most part of it, with the capital Cusco. Atahualpa got the northern parts, including Quito.
Huáscar started the war because he saw himself as the rightful heir to the kingdom. Atahualpa proved to be a better war tactician than his brother, and commanded a much bigger army. The empire was reunited under Atahualpa in 1532, but he was executed by the Spanish less than a year later.
It was partly because of this civil war that the Spanish conquistadors, under Francisco Pizarro, were successful.

Cao Dai

Cao Dai (also Caodaism or Caodaiism) is a new religious movement founded in Vietnam. It mixes ideas from other religions. 
Cao Đài is a syncretistic, monotheistic religion officially established in the city of Tây Ninh, southern Vietnam in 1926. The religion combines Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism, Confucianism and Islam. The full name of the religion is Đại Đạo Tam Kỳ Phổ Độ (great religion of the third period of revelation and salvation).
Cao Dai uses ethical precepts from Confucianism, occult practices from Taoism, theories of Karma and Rebirth from Buddhism ,and a hierarchical organization (including a Pope) from Christianity. Caodaiists (believers of Cao Dai) believe that the first disciples of the religion, Ngô Văn Chiêu, Cao Quỳnh Cư, Phạm Công Tắc and Cao Hoài Sang spoke to God and God spoke to them. God told them to establish a new religion that would commence the third era of religious amesty. Because of this, Caodaiist credit God for finding their religion. The ultimate goal of a Caodaist is to rejoin with God the Father, in Heaven and to break away from the cycle of rebirth and death. Women can only wear white dress as they have to be pure whereas men can wear coloured clothing once they reach higher in the religion. In the daily ceremony, the who women in the choir sing the Bible in an accent that is difficult to understand and they are not allowed to marry.
Cao Dai was established in the Vietnamese city of Tây Ninh in 1926. Cao Dai was granted legal recognition in 1997. Cao Dai was found by Ngô Văn Chiêu, Cao Quỳnh Cư, Phạm Công Tắc and Cao Hoài. Caodaist believe God spoke to them to establish a new religion. 
The name for God in Cao Dai is Cao Đài Tiên Ông Đại Bồ Tát Ma-ha-tát (translation: Cao Đài the Ancient Sage and Great Bodhisattva Mahasattva). Caodaiist believe God chose this title because it represents the Three Teachings: Saint, Sage, and Buddha.
 Cao Dai teaches that before God existed, there was Tao. Tao is the unchanging, nameless, formless, immortal source. Then the Big Bang occurred, and out of the Big Bang, God miraculously blessed us with his birth and was poured onto us from the universe ( emanationism ). The Universe could not be formed so the Yin Yang were created by the Almighty himself. Like Adam took one of his ribs to create Eve, God took control of yang and a part of himself, thereby creating the Goddess to assemble with yin. Now that the Union was completed, the Universe was formed. The Goddess, Holy Mother, is referred by Caodaiist as Mother Buddha. Cao Dai teaches that there are 36 levels of Heaven, and 72 planets having intelligent life. The first planet is closest to Heaven while number 72 is closest to Hell. Earth is number 68.
The three teachings of Cao Dai are:
Note: The top is believed to be the hardest to achieve while the bottom is believed to be the easiest to achieve.
The three teachings represent levels of spiritual attainment. In Cao Dai's teaching being a Buddha is the hardest to achieve. Cao Dai teaches that humans can develop into other beings. Humans can develop into: Thần (angel), Thánh (saint), Tiên (sage), and Phật (buddha). According to Cao Dai, everyone can turn into one of these beings. Angels, Saints, and Sages have extremely long lives in the realms of Heavens, but Buddhas are the only ones free from the cycle of birth and death. 
According to Cao Dai teachings, God is at helm, he will not take human form as in the two past periods. Instead he sends his teachings through sacred seance ceremonies.
The three anchors (the three teachings) are:
 There are many Holy people from other religions. Some people from history are also venerated. The pantheon of Holy people includes: Buddha, Guan Yin, Jesus, Joan of Arc, Muhammad, Sun Yat-sen, Julius Caesar, Victor Hugo, and many more.
These are the main scriptures of Cao Dai.
Other branches of Cao Dai have additional scriptures.
Cao Dai has an organizational structure like Catholicism. Cao Dai's hierarchy includes a Pope, cardinals, bishops, priest, etc. Cao Dai teaches equality between men and women but women are not allowed to be Legislative Cardinal and Pope, the two highest position in Cao Dai. The religion and church claims that God ordered this because Yang represents Male while Yin represents Female. Yin cannot dominate Yang or else Chaos will happen.
 In total there are about 6 officially recognized branches of Cao Dai. There are several others but there are remained unknown. The largest branch is based in Tây Ninh Province, where the religion was founded in 1926 and where the seat of Cao Đài authority is located. Some sects broke away from the Tây Ninh Holy See. The sects that broke away are Chiếu Minh, Bến Tre, and Đà Nẵng. Ngô Văn Chiêu founded Chiếu Minh. He left because he refused his appointment as Cao Dai's first Pope.
Cao Dai is the third largest religion in Vietnam after Buddhism and Roman Catholicism. Estimates of followers in Vietnam, is about 2-6 million around 2%. Estimates of followers oversea, is about 30,000.

Ferromagnetism

Ferromagnetism is a property of many materials like iron. They are magnets, so they are attracted to, or pulled towards other magnets. In physics there are many different type of magnetism. Ferromagnetism is the strongest one. It is used every day in many technological objects, like television screens and credit cards.
Ferromagnets are materials that have some magnetization on their own. This means that at a temperature of absolute zero and without any magnetic field from other objects, they are still magnetic. The reason for this is that the electrons in a material have a spin. In ferromagnetic materials, the electrons like to have all the spins going one way, giving some magnetism. Usually, as the temperature is increased, the magnetization goes down. This is because the temperature causes the electrons in the material to move around a bit more. They do not have the spins perfectly going in the same way anymore. The point at which there is no magnetization anymore is called the Curie temperature. This changes with different materials.
Some materials that are ferromagnets are: iron, cobalt, nickel. Hematite is also ferromagnetic but only above a certain temperature.

David Jalbert

David Jalbert (born May 5, 1980) is a Canadian folk musician and singer-songwriter. He is from Mascouche, Québec. He plays guitar and sings.
David Jalbert grew up in Mascouche, more precisely in the Domaine Lac Samson. His father is a guitarist. This influenced his lifestyle. Jalbert became fascinated with music when he was very young. During elementary school, his passion developed gradually. His parents put him in various competitions and he loved this artist lifestyle. When he was a child, he was inspired by The Colocs, C.C.R, The Beatles, Plume Latraverse, Jonh Mellencamp, Beau Dommage and Bob Dylan.
In 1994, Jalbert joined a band of three. The group was called Big Joe, and they played punk rock music. After that, he focused on his studies to finish school and to later be able to get a job. Meanwhile, he continued to write and compose songs. 
In 2000, Jalbert again played music in several competitions. In 2004, he played in the Mascouche competition "MusiQualité", where he won two prizes. The first one was public's choice and the second one was jury's choice. Through various competitions, he had professional encounters with Yves Marchand, Charles Dubé and the producer Alain Dupuis. They helped him to prepare his first album called "Des histoires". They chose thirteen titles from amongst thirty songs. The album was launched on April 15, 2008. He started playing concerts to promote the album on August 26, 2008, during the "FrancoFolies" of Montreal. It was followed by a tour through the Québec.
The song "Souvenir d’enfance" was the most successful song from the album. It became popular on the radio, and it was used in a McDonald's advertisement. His creative director, Mathieu Dandurand won the prize for production of the year at the gala of Terre-Neuve. Jalbert was nominated for two categories for French songwriters (he was nominated again in those categories in 2010). His second prize was for the "Artiste de la relève". He got the most nomination of any artist in the year. In 2009, he played in the "Studio-Théâtre de la Place des arts" three times and many other times in the "Cabaret juste pour rire".
The song "Raison" was the second most successful from the album. It was more successful with critics than Jalbert thought it would be. "L’aveugle" was the third radio hit. By autumn 2009, there were three music videos, forty shows and more than 15,000 albums were sold.
On May 4, 2010, Jalbert released his second studio album "Le journal". It contained the hit songs "Voyage", "Le journal", "P’tit homme", "Rendez-vous" and "Y'a pu une once". The song "Voyage" was a commercial success, and was at the top of the charts of major stations in Montreal and Québec. The song "P’tit homme" was written for Jalbert's son Félix. Later in 2010, Jalbert was invited on the TV show "Salut Bonjour" for a cultural chronic, and he played in the park Philippe-Villeneuve during the National Day festivities. In addition, he won a prize of the "Socan" for his popular song "Voyage", which was among the list of top ten pop songs most popular in 2010.
For the first time in his career, in 2011, he was nominated for best contemporary folk album at the ADISQ awards, for his album named "Le journal". The album was critically acclaimed, and is Jalbert's most commercially successful album to date. With "Des histoires" and "Le journal", Jalbert has sold over 25,000 albums. His tour show for "Le journal" was sold out. There was a second concert at the "Lion d’Or" in Montreal.
On September 18, 2012, Jalbert released his third album, "Y’a pas de bon silence". This contained the popular song "Hey Jack!", which was song dedicated to his son Jacob. This album was the fourth best selling French album in 2012, with over 2,500 albums sold since its release.
Later in 2012, Jalbert joined a project called "Fondation Dédé Fortin". His song "Ma mère disait" was part of the campaign against suicide, which is an initiative of the Quebec Associtation for Suicide Prevention with the support of psychologists of Quebec.

The calendar was created in 425 during the "Genka" era in Chinese history.
The "Genka-reki" system was brought to Japan from Korea by a Buddhist monk. The earliest record of this calendar in Japan is in the 10th month of the 10th year of the reign of Empress Suiko (602).
Dates in the "Nihon Shoki" before the late 7th century were likely recorded using the "Genka" calendar system.

<doc id="378264" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=378264" title="Oestrous cycle">
Oestrous cycle

The oestrous cycle (U.S: estrous cycle) is the reproductive system in most mammals.
Reproductive hormones cause the cycles to start after puberty in sexually mature females. They are interrupted by non-breeding phases or by pregnancies. Usually estrous cycles continue until death.
Mammals share the same reproductive system, including the regulatory hypothalamic system that releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone in pulses, the pituitary that secretes follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, and the ovary itself releases sex hormones like estrogens and progesterone. 
However, species vary in the details. One difference is that animals that have oestrous cycles reabsorb the endometrium if conception does not occur during that cycle. Animals that have menstrual cycles shed the endometrium through menstruation instead. 
Another difference is sexual activity. In species with oestrous cycles, females are generally only sexually active during the oestrus phase of their cycle. This is referred to as being 'in heat'. 
In contrast, females of species with menstrual cycles can be sexually active at any time in their cycle, even when they are not about to ovulate. Humans and some other primates, do not have any obvious external signs to signal when ovulation occurs (concealed ovulation). Recent research suggests that women tend to have more sexual thoughts and are more prone to sexual activity right before ovulation (estrus). Nevertheless, this is nothing as obvious as the frenzy which other mammals show during 'heat'.

Luteinizing hormone

Luteinizing hormone (LH, lutropin or lutrophin) is a sex hormone produced by gonadotroph cells in the anterior pituitary gland. 
In females, an LH surge triggers ovulation and development of the corpus luteum (a temporary endocrine structure in female mammals that promotes relatively high levels of progesterone). In males, where LH had also been called ICSH, it stimulates Leydig cell production of testosterone. It acts synergistically with Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).
The detection of a surge in luteinising hormone shows ovulation will soon happen. LH can be detected by urinary test kits. Tests are done daily, round the time ovulation is expected. A swing from a negative to a positive reading suggests that ovulation will occur in 24–48 hours. The women has two days to engage in sexual intercourse or artificial insemination with the intentions of conceiving.
Tests may be read manually using a colour-change paper strip, or digitally with the assistance of reading electronics.

<doc id="378284" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=378284" title="Thomas Ley">
Thomas Ley

Thomas John Ley (28 October 1880 – 29 July 1947) was an Australian politician. He was convicted of murder in England. He was probably involved in the deaths of three people in Australia.
Ley was born in Bath, England. His father died in 1882 and his mother moved the family to Australia in 1886. He attended Crown Street Public School in Sydney until he was ten. He then worked as an assistant in his mother's grocery store. He learnt shorthand, he became a junior clerk-stenographer in a solicitor's office at 14. He married Emily Louisa (known as "Lewie") Vernon in 1898, the year she came to Australia from England. Both husband and wife were active in politics. She was part of the international suffrage movement. He became a state (New South Wales) and federal politician from 1917 to 1928.
Ley served in the lower house of the New South Wales parliament (1917–25) as member for Hurstville from 1917 to 1920, representing the Nationalist Party of Australia. He then was member for St George from 1920 to 1925, representing the Progressive Party from 1920 to 1922. The Progressive Party supported proportional representation, which the state adopted in 1919. Both his electorates were in Sydney's southern suburbs. 
As a teetotaller, Ley was given the nickname "Lemonade Ley". The Temperance Movement was angry when he supported laws which made it easier to sell alcohol. They found out later he was being paid by the breweries. He was still made the New South Wales' Minister for Justice from 1922 to 1925. He gained a reputation for harsh decisions.
Shortly after he became Minister for Justice, Ley made an official visit to Western Australia. He met Maggie Evelyn Brook, a magistrate's wife. After the magistrate died, Ley acted for her and her daughter in various financial and legal matters. She later became his mistress.
In 1925, Ley was elected as the Nationalist Party of Australia member for Barton in the federal House of Representatives. Other party members began to have doubts about him after the election. He was not given a federal ministry. This would normally have been expected for a man who had been a state government minister. 
During the 1925 election, Ley had tried to bribe his ALP opponent, Frederick McDonald. McDonald also said that Ley had offered him a £2000 share in a property at Sydney's Kings Cross in return for withdrawing from the election. Ley won the election, and McDonald took legal action. McDonald disappeared and has never been seen again. Because McDonald could not give evidence in court, the legal action against Ley was dropped. 
McDonald's disappearance may have been a coincidence. But in 1927, Hyman Goldstein, the member for Coogee in the NSW parliament's lower house, was found dead after falling from "Suicide Point" on the cliffs of Coogee. Goldstein had lost money in a business run by Ley and had made comments about him. A group of businessmen were concerned by Ley's business dealings. Many people lost money when Ley's company, SOS Prickly Pear Poisons Ltd, closed. Ley had sold his shares days before it closed and made a lot of money. Keith Greedor, who had worked with Ley, was asked to investigate. On his way to Newcastle by boat, Greedor fell overboard and drowned.
After his defeat in the 1928 election, Ley returned to England. He took Maggie Brook, his mistress of several years, leaving his wife in Australia.
Little is recorded of Ley's life during the 1930s. He again became involved in dubious business ventures, and during World War II he was arrested and convicted for black marketeering.
In 1946 Maggie Brook was living in Wimbledon, and Ley had his house at 5 Beaufort Gardens, London, converted into flats. Ley thought Brook and a barman called John McMain Mudie were lovers. Ley told two of his workers that Mudie was a blackmailer. They tortured and killed him. The case became known as the "Chalk-pit Murder" because Mudie's body was dumped in a Surrey chalk-pit.
With Lawrence John Smith, Ley was tried at the Old Bailey, and both were sentenced to death in March 1947. However, Smith's sentence was changed to life imprisonment. Ley was found to be insane and was sent to Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane. There he died soon after. He is said to have been the wealthiest person ever to be a Broadmoor prisoner.
Ley's wife had followed him to England in 1942. From Broadmoor, Ley wrote letters and poems and protested his innocence to his wife and children. After his death, Lewie Ley returned to Australia. She died at Bowral, New South Wales, in 1956.

Shah Puri dialect

Shah puri is one of the oldest dialect of the Punjabi language spoken in Sargodh Division of Pakistani Punjab. 
Its name is derived from former Shahpur District (now Shahpur Tehsil, part of Sargodha District). It is also called Western Punjabi. 
This dialect has great proximity with Majhi Dialect of Punjabi Language. It can be described as a mixture of Majhi, Pothohari and thalochi dialects. Shahpurias in the Khushab area speak this dialect in a more Thalochi tone while those in southern parts of its distribution have color of Jhangochi on their language.
It is spoken throughout a widespread area, spoken in Sargodha and Khushab Districts and also spoken in neighbouring Mianwali, Mandi Bahudin and Bhakkar Districts. It is mainly spoken on western end of Sindh River to Chennab river crossing Jehlam river.
This entire area has almost the same traditions, customs and culture. The Shahpuri dialect of Punjabi has several aspects that set it apart from other Punjabi variants. 
Two districts of Punjab Province of Pakistan and neighboring districts speak this dialect.

Kerning

In typography, kerning is changing the space between two letters to make the text easier to read. Usually, this means that letters look equally spaced, and two letters are never too close together or too far apart. If two letters are too close together or too far apart that would make it difficult to read the plain text message.
The purpose of kerning, and most other typography is to make the printed or screen text more legible, that is, easier to read, and also more attractive. 
A related idea is typographic ligature. This is when two letters are formed so they fit together. In traditional metal type printing, ligatures were formed from lead in certain pairs. It is basically the same idea as kerning, but done automatically.

Bagh-e-Jinnah (used to be called Lawrence Gardens) is a large park in Lahore, Pakistan. It includes a botanical garden and other popular facilities, which were made during the British Raj. The Gardens were originally named after Sir John Lawrence, who was the first Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab and who did much to develop the city of Lahore in colonial times. 
After Pakistan's independence, some people demanded that the Gardens be renamed with a more 'patriotic' name so during the 1980s, their name was finally changed to "Bagh i Jinnah" (Jinnah's Gardens), after Muhammad Ali Jinnah, founder of the country. However, many people in Lahore still continue to call the Gardens as 'Lawrence Gardens', for the sake of historical accuracy.

Grafting or graftage is a technique used in horticulture that consists of taking tissues from one plant and putting them onto another plant. The two plants will then grow together. The technique is a type of vegetative reproduction. Grafting is commonly used with roses, and fruit trees. It only works with dicots and gymnosperms, and not with monocots. Monocots do not have a vascular cambium, which is needed for the process to work. There are several different methods of grafting; each method has its advantages and drawbacks.

Pulpurru Davies

Pulpurru Davies is an Aboriginal artist from central Australia. Most of her early life was spent living nomadically in the desert, until she and her family were settled at Warburton in the late 1960s. Part of her life in the bush was featured in the documentary "People of the Australian Western Desert" (1966). She has since become one of the earliest and most successful Ngaanyatjarra artists.
Pulpurru was born around the early 1940s. She was born near Yankaltjunku, a rockhole in the northeast Gibson Desert. Her family belong to the Ngaanyatjarra people, for whom Yankaltjunku is a sacred place. Pulpurru grew up living a traditional, nomadic way of life in the desert with her family. They moved from waterhole to waterhole in their traditional country. They lived this way up until the 1960s, by which time they were one of the last groups of nomadic people in Australia.
By the mid-1960s, Pulpurru's family were camped at Patjarr, which was only a rockhole at the time. They had been forced to stay in one place because of several years of drought, and Patjarr usually had a reliable supply of water. While they were living there, an English anthropologist named Ian Dunlop came and filmed the family in their daily routines. It was later made into a documentary, titled "People of the Australian Western Desert" (1966), produced by the Australian Commonwealth Film Unit. Pulpurru was an adult by that time.
Like most other Ngaanyatjarra groups, Pulpurru and her family were moved out of the desert to settle at Warburton. They were brought there by government patrol officers in the late 1960s. At Warburton, Davies worked several domestic jobs. It was at Warburton that Davies began working in arts and crafts, at the Warburton Arts Project. Alongside other women, she learned to paint using modern Western techniques and how to make glasswork designs.
In the early 1990s, a road was built out to Patjarr, and Davies and her family returned to establish a permanent community there (Karilywara). This is where Davies now lives and paints. She paints for Kayili Artists, the community artists' co-operative.
Davies paints events and stories from her country, and the Dreaming legends associated with it. Places often depicted in her paintings are Yankaltjunku (where she was born), Kiwarr (where her family used to dig for water), and Mirra Mirra (where one of Pulpurru's sons was born). She works with paints, "tjanpi" (grass weaving) and "punu" (wood carving).
Davies' work has been exhibited across Australia since 1990. It was first shown overseas in 1998, as part of a group exhibition at the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur. She also had work featured in a major group exhibition in China in 2011 (called "Tu Di – Shen Ti" / "Our Land – Our Body").
In 2007, one of her paintings, titled "Kiwarr", was chosen as a finalist for the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award (NATSIAA). It was eventually bought by the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory as part of its NATSIAA collection. Other of Davies' work are held in the National Gallery of Victoria, the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art, the National Museum of Australia, and the of the University of Virginia. Some of her paintings are also displayed in the State Paraliament building of Western Australia, and in a few major private galleries in Germany and the United States.

Breuil-Cervinia

Breuil-Cervinia is a village in the Valle d'Aosta region of Italy. It is famous for its ski resort, which has a link to the one in Zermatt, Switzerland. 
Breuil-Cervinia is a "frazione" of the "comune" of Valtournenche. It is at 2,006 m above sea level. It stands below the Matterhorn (in Italian: "Cervino", in French: "Cervin"). The name of the village comes from "Breuil", which is the French name of the valley where the village is, and "Cervinia" from the Italian name of the Matterhorn. The FIBT bobsleigh world championships took place here for three years: 1971, 1975 and 1985. The Giro d'Italia also had a stage (a day of racing) finishing here for three times: 1960, 1997 and 2012.

Aosta

Aosta (, ) is a city in northern Italy. It is the capital city of the Valle d'Aosta () region. It is roughly in the middle of the region, along the Dora Baltea (), the main river that flows in the valley. It is at 583 m above sea level. Around the city there are many mountains (the Alps).
Romans conquered the area in 25 BC. Later, the city was conquered by the Frankish Empire after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Finally, it went under control of the House of Savoy in the 11th century. Many Roman buildings still survive in the city, like the east and south gates. The basic plan of the city, with rectangular blocks of streets, is Roman.
The valley of Aosta is a typical alpine valley, cut into a V-shape by glaciers during the ice age. It runs from an upper part near Mont Blanc to lower areas like the city of Aosta.
The area has been Roman, French and Italian (House of Savoy) before the unification of Italy. All street names are in French and Italian, and dialects of French are still spoken by many.
The Romans defeated the local "Salassi" tribe in 25 BC. Their commander, Marcus Terentius Varro, then founded the Roman colony of "Augusta Praetoria Salassorum", housing 3,000 retired veterans. 
After 11 BC Aosta became the capital of the "Alpes Graies" ("Grey Alps") province of the Empire. 
Aosta is at the join of two rivers. It is at the end of the Great St Bernard Pass (which leads to Switzerland) and the Little St Bernard Pass (which leads to France). Its position gave it considerable military importance, and the layout of the town was that of a Roman military camp. 
The valley was a way for trade and soldiers to get from Italy to Gaul (later, France). This explains its importance to the Romans. Now it sits near the Italian entrance of the Mont Blanc Tunnel. 
At present Aosta Valley is a semi-autonomous region in northwestern Italy. It is the smallest region in Italy, and is not divided into provinces.
Aostan French () is the variety of French spoken in the Aosta Valley, where many speak some form of French. Some expressions, words and phrase constructions are different from standard French; some are similar to Swiss French. Some words come from the Piedmontese language or Italian. Both modern French and Italian mix with this local "patois", "valdôtain", which is Franco-Provençal in type.

Goryōkaku

"Goryōkaku" was designed in 1855 by Takeda Hisaburō. His plan was based on the work of the French architect Vauban. The fort is shaped like a five-pointed star. This allowed for greater numbers of gun emplacements on its walls than a traditional Japanese fortress, and reduced the number of blind spots where a cannon could not fire.
The fort was built by the Tokugawa shogunate to protect the Tsugaru Strait against a possible invasion by the Russian fleet. 
Goryōkaku is famous as the site of the last battle of the Boshin War ("Goryōkaku no Tatakai"). The fighting lasted for a week (June 20-27 1869).

The Lego Movie

The Lego Movie is a 2014 Warner Bros. comedy-animated-adventure brickfilm. The movie was released on February 7, 2014.
Based on the Lego line of construction toys, the movie tells the story of an ordinary Lego minifigure prophesied to save the Lego universe from the tyrannical Lord Business, who plans to use the Kragle to end the world.
It was released theatrically on February 7, 2014. The movie was a critical and commercial success, with many critics highlighting its visual style, humor, voice acting, and heartwarming message. It earned more than $257 million in North America and $210 million in other territories for a worldwide total of over $467 million.
A sequel, titled "The Lego Movie 2" is scheduled to be released on May 26, 2017, with Chris McKay set to direct. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller will return as producers.
In the Lego universe, the wizard Vitruvius attempts to protect a superweapon called the "Kragle" from the evil Lord Business. He fails to do so, but prophesies that a person called "the Special" will find the Piece of Resistance capable of stopping the Kragle.
Eight and a half years later, an ordinary construction worker named Emmet Brickowski from Bricksburg, a city run as a corporate state under the Octan Corporation, comes across a woman named Wyldstyle who searches for something after hours at Emmet's construction site. When he investigates, Emmet falls into a hole and finds the Piece of Resistance. Compelled to touch it, Emmet experiences vivid visions and passes out. He awakens with the Piece of Resistance attached to his back in the custody of Bad Cop, Business' lieutenant. There, Emmet learns of Business' plans to freeze the world with the Kragle, revealed to be a tube of Krazy Glue with the label partially rubbed out.
Wyldstyle rescues Emmet and takes him to meet Vitruvius in The Old West, explaining that they are Master Builders, people capable of building anything they need without instruction manuals. She further explains that most of them are incarcerated due to Business' disapproval of such anarchic creativity. Though disappointed to find Emmet displays no creativity, Wyldstyle and Vitruvius are convinced of his potential when he recalls visions of a gargantuan humanoid deity called "the Man Upstairs". Meanwhile, Business, dissatisfied that Emmet had escaped, has Bad Cop come to his office and makes him freeze his own parents in order to make sure that he remains committed to his plan. Upset at Bad Cop's refusal to do so, Business erases Bad Cop's "Good Cop" face, which served as his conscience.
Emmet, Wyldstyle, and Vitruvius evade Bad Cop's forces with the aid of Wyldstyle's boyfriend, the superhero Batman, and go to Cloud Cuckoo Land, home of Princess Unikitty. They attend to a council of the remaining Master Builders, who are unimpressed with Emmet and refuse to fight Business. Bad Cop's forces attack and capture all the Master Builders except for Emmet, Wyldstyle, Vitruvius, Batman, Princess Unikitty, and a "1980-something space guy" named Benny.
After being rescued by a pirate named Metal Beard, Emmet devises a team plan to infiltrate Business' headquarters to rescue the Master Builders and disarm the Kragle. During a quiet moment, Wyldstyle and Emmet bond, and Wyldstyle reveals that her real name is Lucy. However, Emmet and his allies are all captured and imprisoned, and Vitruvius is killed with a coin thrown by Lord Business. With his dying words, Vitruvius reveals to Emmet that he had made up the prophecy. Business throws the Piece of Resistance off the edge of the universe, programs the prison to electrocute all the Master Builders, and leaves them (and Bad Cop) to die. As the execution timer counts down, Vitruvius' ghost appears and tells Emmet that it was not the prophecy, but his self-belief that made him the Special. Tied to the execution mechanism's battery, Emmet flings himself off the edge of the universe to save his friends, who escape further danger with the aid of a newly-reformed Bad Cop. Inspired by Emmet's sacrifice, Lucy rallies the Lego people across the universe to use whatever creativity they have to build machines and weapons to fight Business' forces, with the Master Builders leading the charge.
Emmet finds himself alive and in the real world, where the events of the story are being played out within the imagination of a boy named Finn on his father's Lego set. His father — now revealed as "the Man Upstairs" — chastises his son for ruining the set by creating hodgepodges of different playsets, and proceeds to permanently glue his "perfect" creations together back to their normal forms. Realizing the danger his friends are in, Emmet moves off the table and gains Finn's attention. Finn returns Emmet and the Piece of Resistance to the set where Emmet, now possessing the powers of a Master Builder due to his belief in himself, confronts Lord Business.
Meanwhile, Finn's father becomes impressed by his son's creations and realizes that Finn had based the villainous Lord Business on him. Through a speech Emmet gives Business, Finn tells his father that "he" is special and has the power to change everything. Finn's father reconciles with his son, which plays out as Lord Business has a change of heart and caps the Kragle with the Piece of Resistance. As Lucy becomes Emmet's girlfriend with Batman's blessing, Lord Business unglues his victims with mineral spirits. However, as a result of the father allowing Finn's younger sister to join them in playing with his Lego sets, Duplo aliens beam down and announce their plans to destroy the universe.
The Lego Movie received many positive reviews. It currently has a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
The Lego Movie was released in DVD and Blue-ray along with Blue-ray 3D on June 17, 2014.
The toy brand and inspiration of the movie, Legos, began making and selling sets based on the movie.
On February 3, 2014, Jared Stern was hired to write a sequel, along with another individual. The sequel will be released on May 26, 2017.

Guild Wars 2

Guild Wars 2 is a type of computer game called a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that is played on the Internet. It is owned by ArenaNet. "Guild Wars 2" takes place in a fantasy world that is called Tyria. The game's story is about a guild called Destiny's Edge, and their attempt to kill six evil elder dragons. It is the sequel to "Guild Wars". In August 2015, the game became free to play, and had sold more than 5 million copies by then.
The world of "Guild Wars 2" is the same as the world in "Guild Wars", but many changes has been made to it. These changes include new buildings and new landscapes, because "Guild Wars 2" takes place 250 years after "Guild Wars". Much of the land has also been corrupted by the elder dragons. 
There are five different races to choose from when you create a new character. These races are Human and Charr, from "Guild Wars Prophecies", Norn and Asura from "Guild Wars Eye of the North", and the Sylvari, a new race to the "Guild Wars" series. There are also 8 professions to choose from. The profession and race of the player decides what special abilities the player can use. As in "Guild Wars", the player has a skill bar where he/she can choose from a large pool of abilities. The skill bar is different from "Guild Wars". It can now hold ten skills instead of eight, but is more limited. The weapon the player is holding decides the first five skill slots. The 6th slot is used for a healing skill. The 7th, 8th and 9th slots are used to hold the remaining skills that the player can use. Finally, the 10th slot is used for an elite skill, which is more powerful than the other skills. ArenaNet has made the skill bar more limited to solve the balance problem many MMORPGs has. Skills in "Guild Wars 2" has also been made in quality instead of quantity.
The maximum level is higher than in "Guild Wars". The player can now get to level 80 instead of 20. ArenaNet said that level 80 is a good maximum level because it allows the player to go through the game's storyline without having to grind. It was very important for ArenaNet that players in "Guild Wars 2" should not have to grind. This is because ArenaNet wanted the players to have fun the entire time they were playing "Guild Wars 2". The player's level can also change depending on where in the world the player is. When the players fight monsters the player's level will be the same level as the monsters of that area plus one. For example, if a level 80 character goes to a level 5 area, he will become level 6, if he goes to a level 10 area, he will become level 11.
There are two ways the player can fight other players in "Guild Wars 2": World versus World and Structured PvP. In Structured PVP the player gains the maximum level and gain access to all abilities in the game. The players then fight players five versus five on matches that are about 10 minutes long. Unlike World versus World the players can not use rewards from Structured PvP anywhere outside Structured PvP. In World versus World the player also gains the maximum level, but can not use abilities that are not unlocked by the players character. World versus world matches are also one entire week long, so the player can join and leave whenever he wants. The goal in World versus World is to take control of capture points; castles, forts and camps. Holding these points gives points to the server holding them. The points gives players rewards in the servers world, such as more experience and more money from killing monsters.
Because Guild Wars 2 takes place 250 years after "Guild Wars", the player can not keep their character from "Guild Wars" in "Guild Wars 2". Instead the player can link their "Guild Wars" account to the "Guild Wars 2" account to get rewards in "Guild Wars 2". The points are gained by completing a variety of tasks in "Guild Wars". When a task is completed, the player can turn the task into points by adding them to the Hall of Monuments. The Hall of Monuments is available in the "Eye of the North" expansion.
Guild Wars 2 takes place 250 years after the player defeats the Great Destroyer in "Guild Wars Eye of the North". Over the past 2 centuries, Elder Dragons who has slept under the earth has awoken. Currently, 5 dragons have awoken, and they have started to destroy and corrupt Tyria. The humans have lost almost all of Ascalon to the Charr. The remaining humans now live in Kryta and Ebonhawke. The norn, a race of nordic hunters, has been driven from their homeland in the north by Jormag, an Elder Dragon of ice. The Norn now live in the Southern shiverpeaks, instead of the northen shiverpeaks. The asura, a small but smart race, has been driven out of their homeland to the west. Their underground home has been invaded by destroyers. The Destroyers are servants to Primordus, an Elder Dragon of fire. The asura now live in Rata Sum, a very large city floating in the air. East of Rata sum, a new race has arrived to Tyria; the sylvari, The sylvari are similar to humans, but they are made out of trees, bushes and even mushrooms. They birth from the Pale Tree, a tree that was planted during "Guild Wars Eye of the North".

<doc id="378485" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=378485" title="Retinal migraine">
Retinal migraine

Retinal migraine (also known as ophthalmic migraines, or ocular migraines) is a medical condition that affects the eyes by causing vision loss in one eye for less than 1 hour, usually for about 10–20 minutes. When these retinal migraines happen they can also cause a headache, either a "diffuse" headache which is a headache that causes pain which is spread out and hurts a person's whole head, or, a "unilateral" headache, which is a headache that causes pain on one side of a persons head either, the left side or the right side.
It is believed retinal migraines are caused by "vasospasms "of the blood vessels of the eye in the area of the "retina". The retina is at the back of the inside of the eye. In medicine a "spasm" is a sudden constriction or tightening of muscles that is "involuntary" - a person does not control them they move on their own. Muscle spasms can happen in different muscles of the body, like when a person's leg or eye "twitches". The twitching is caused by the spasms.
"Vaso-" means something to do with the blood vessels, so a "vasospasm" causes the muscle cells inside the walls of a blood vessel to suddenly constrict or tighten up. This causes the whole blood vessel to "constrict" which means makes the blood vessel narrower. When a blood vessel constricts it is called "vasoconstriction". 
When vasoconstriction happens less blood the normal is able to flow through the blood vessel, like the way squeezing (constricting) a garden hose makes less water come out. Vasoconstriction can happen for different reasons including because of a medical problem.
The second part of a vasospasm -"vasodilation" - occurs after the vasoconstriction. After the blood vessel constricts it "dilates" - becomes bigger. It may return to normal size or slightly larger than normal size. 
The vasoconstriction and vasodilation complete one spasm. Spasms often happen many times over and over again. It is beleved that the muscle cells tigntening and loosenening may trigger the pain of a retinal migraine.

Ambient intelligence

Ambient intelligence is an idea from computer science to create an environment of machines that meaningfully interact with people. The idea is that these machines help people solve the problems they have, and that people can interact with the machines in a natural way. An example would be a camera that recognizes the owner of a house or apartment, and that is able to turn off the alarm, and unlock the door. The systems that control the camera, the alarm system and the door lock are all connected to each other. When the camera sees the person, it works with the other systems to make the person's life easier. 
In order for the idea to work well:
Ambient intelligence has also be shown in fiction. The movie "Minority Report" shows how advertising changes for each user. the book "The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams shows intelligent doors that have emotions, which they show when people use them.

<doc id="378549" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=378549" title="Stew">
Stew

A stew is a dish cooked for a long time, and served in the gravy produced by the cooking. The basic materials may be any meat and/or vegetables. It is ideal for tough meat like mutton and beef cuts which have marbling (fat) and connective tissue. Also, the tougher vegetables should be used.
It is traditional to start off with a simple sauce, such as a roux. Even simpler, flour and an Oxo stock cube can be stirred in some milk and water. It is usual for the tougher meats to start off by themselves, with vegetables added later.
Casseroles and stews are similar. Casseroles often have a topping; stews do not. Stewing is a cooking process whereby heat is applied to the bottom of the cooking vessel (typically over a fire or on a stove), whereas casserole cooking is generally baked in an oven where heat circulates all around the cooking vessel. 
Stews have been made since ancient times. It figures in the Roman cookbook by Apicius. Herodotus says that the Scythians (8th to 4th centuries BC) "put the flesh into an animal's paunch, mix water with it, and boil it like that over the bone fire. The bones burn very well, and the paunch easily contains all the meat once it has been stripped off. In this way an ox, or any other sacrificial beast, is ingeniously made to boil itself."
Amazonian tribes used the shells of turtles as vessels, boiling the entrails of the turtle and various other ingredients in them. Other cultures used the shells of large mollusks (clams etc.) to boil foods in. There is archaeological evidence of these practices going back 8,000 years or more. 
There are recipes for lamb stews and fish stews in the Roman cookery book "Apicius", believed to date from the 4th century AD. "Le Viandier", one of the oldest cookbooks in French, written by the French chef known as Taillevent, has ragouts or stews of various types in it. 
Hungarian goulash dates back to the 9th century Magyar shepherds of the area, before the existence of Hungary. Paprika was added in the 18th century. 
The first written reference to 'Irish stew' is in Byron's "The Devil's Drive" (1814): "The Devil ... dined on ... a rebel or so in an Irish stew."

Yilpi Adamson

Imiyari "Yilpi" Adamson (born 1954) is an Aboriginal artist from central Australia. She is known for her work in a range of art forms, including painting, sculpture, weaving, knitting and batik.
Yilpi was born at a place near Uluru, in the Northern Territory. Her mother was a member of the Pitjantjatjara people and her father was Yankunytjatjara. When Yilpi was still very young, her parents came to live at Ernabella, a Presbyterian mission in northwest South Australia. She grew up there, and later began working at Ernabella Arts.
Batik was one of the first forms of art Yilpi learned to make at Ernabella. Several of her works were shown at an exhibition in Adelaide in 2006, and one of these was bought for the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney. Later examples of her batik works were bought by the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. Yilpi is also known for making woven items, such as baskets, out of "tjanpi" (desert grass). She made several objects with a women's project called the Tjanpi Desert Weavers.
Yilpi began painting much more recently. She has painted both abstract and figurative works. The abstract works are expressions of her Dreaming legends, passed down to her from her mother. Her most successful works, however, are the figurative paintings of her life as a child at Ernabella in the 1950s. Examples of Yilpi's paintings are held in the Art Gallery of South Australia, and the National Museum of Australia. The National Gallery of Australia also has a series of ceramic pots that Yilpi painted with Malpiya Davey, Alison Carroll, and other Ernabella women.

Milyika Carroll

Milyika Carroll (born 4 March 1958), often known as Alison Carroll or "Windlass" Carroll, is an Aboriginal Australian artist. She is also a community leader on the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia.
Milyika was born in 1958, in Ernabella, northwest South Australia. At that time, it was a Presbyterian mission for Aboriginal people. After finishing primary school here, she went to high school in Alice Springs, at Saint Philips College and Yirara College. She moved back to Ernabella after finishing school. She briefly worked at the community's craft centre, making hand-painted bookmarks and gift cards. She also learned to use batik methods, which had been introduced to the community in 1971.
After about one or two years of working at the craft centre, Carroll decided to become a health worker. She did her training in Adelaide, and then went back to Ernabella to work in the clinic. She still worked at the craft centre sometimes, learning under her mother.
Carroll is married to Pepai Carroll, and they have five children.
Carroll has been involved in the administration of Ernabella Arts for several years. She served as its chairperson from 2001 to 2003, as its manager from 2004 to 2007, and then as chairperson again from 2007 to 2010. She was also the chairperson of Aṉanguku Arts and Culture Aboriginal Corporation from 2004 to 2006, and then became its director. Aṉanguku Arts is the organisation that coordinates and supports development of the art economy on the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands. Her husband Pepai has also served as the organisation's chairman.
In April 2008, Carroll was chosen to attend the Australia 2020 Summit in Canberra, where she and Makinti Minutjukur represented the APY communities. She has since been involved in school administration in Ernabella, including serving as the chairwoman of the Governing Council of Ernabella Aṉangu School since 2011.
Carroll is known for painting, printmaking, batik, ceramic and textile works. She uses several printmaking methods, including lithographs, etchings and screen printing. Her painted designs are called "", which are designs and symbols that mean something to her. They represent her identity and her own view of the world, and are associated with her family's Dreaming legends. The designs are abstract, and come from ancient ceremonial designs (historically painted on the body or rock).
Carroll has had her works held in many public and private galleries both in Australia and other countries. Example of her batik works are held in the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, the State Library of South Australia in Adelaide, and the British Museum. The National Museum of Australia and the National Gallery of Australia both contain multiple examples of Carroll's printings, etchings, batik works, and textile paintings.
One of her earliest works, a painting done on paper, was chosen as one of the finalists for the first National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 1984. In 2011, Carroll's uncle, Dickie Minyintiri, became one of the oldest people to win the award.

Pinscreen animation

Pinscreen animation is a technique used for making animated movies with a device called a pinscreen. This device is a screen lit by the two vertical sides and filled with a vast number of movable pins. The pins can be pushed back and forth, casting their shadows on the screen to create images. It makes unique visual effects, but because of the meticulousness the technique requires and its time-consuming side, it has been and always remains very rarely used.
The pinscreen is a device invented in the early thirties by Alexandre Alexeïeff, a French engraver, illustrator and filmmaker of Russian origin. Alexeïeff conceived this device to make animation movies showing the same kind of textural effects that its engravings.
The device is a white screen with a multitude of little holes on all its surface. Each hole is filled with a pin that can slide back and forth and the screen is lit by the two vertical sides, allowing the pins to cast their shadow on the screen. If all the pins are pushed in the screen, they can't cast any shadow and the screen appears entirely white. Conversely, if all the pins are pushed out of the screen, it's total darkness. Depending of how far the pins jut out of the front of the screen, their shadows are shorter or longer, allowing the artist to create images in different tones of gray.
Each of the frames created on the pinscreen is photographed before creating the next frame. When strung together, the frames create the illusion of movement.
Alexeïeff and his partner Claire Parker completed, in 1933, the animated movie "Night on Bald Mountain", before making another movie in 1943, "En passant", for the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). Many years later, The NFB acquired a full-sized pinscreen and in 1972, Alexeïeff and Parker were invited back to the NFB and gave several workshops on pinscreen animation to a group of filmmakers. One of the most interested Quebecer filmmaker in pinscreen animation is probably Jacques Drouin. He made several animated movies using that technique : "Trois exercices sur l'écran d'épingles d'Alexeïef" in 1974, "Mindscape" in 1976, "Nightangel" in 1986 that was co-directed with Bretislav Pojar, "Ex-child" in 1994, "A Hunting Lesson" in 2001 and "Imprints" in 2004. It's with his movie "Mindscape" that Drouin expressed his own style with the pinscreen technique for the first time, a style different from Alexeïeff's. On the technical plane, Drouin also innovated with "Nightangel", in which he colours the pinscreen images by filtering the light sources. Recently, animator and illustrator Michèle Lemieux has made "Le grand ailleurs et le petit ici" with the NFB's pinscreen.

Muria people

The Muria are an aboriginal tribe in Chhattisgarh, India. They are a tribe of the Gondi people. The Muria live in the Bastar district of Chhattisgarh. They traditionally live by agriculture, hunting and fishing, working as a community. They are surrounded by Hindu culture, but they are animists. They have an omnivorous diet, and liquor plays a big role in their society. According to sociologists, the Muria tribe is a very harmonious society.
When they reach adolescence, children leave their family houses to live in a "ghotul". A "ghotul" is like a mixed-sex dormitory where adolescents practice sexual intercourse, sometimes with a single partner and sometimes with multiple partners. Pregnancy should be avoided and they are obligated to regularly change partners, in order to avoid affection. In the "ghotul", the minors govern themselves and it is important to maintain social and traditional order in the group. If the rules are not respected, the children will be punished. They can be expelled from the "ghotul" and this can be almost as bad as death.
In the "ghotul", there is no bond of affection because they want to avoid too much love before the marriage. The objective of all this organisation is to avoid divorce. For the Muria, it is considered important to govern sexuality in their community, because they believe that the sexuality is the biggest problem of humans and that society will not be able to achieve equilibrium if they don't figure prominently in sexuality.

Dress code

A dress code is a rule about what people should wear. Many times these rules are obvious: they do not need to be written. For example, when walking around a city or going to work one needs to have appropriate clothes. These can change depending on different countries and cultures. At other times a dress code can be a written rule: this can happen for important events. Some private places might also have a dress code that people need to follow to be allowed in. Examples are churches and nightclubs.
The way a person chooses his clothes can be very important in a social environment. Different types of clothes can give an idea of how much money a person has, what religion he follows, marital status etc.
In the Western world, there are the following dress codes for important events. These can include, for example, State dinners (when important people of different countries meet over dinner), weddings or the Nobel Prize ceremony.

Function composition

In mathematics, function composition is a way to make a new function from two other functions.
If we let "f" be a function from "X" to "Y" and "g" be a function from "Y" to "Z" then we say that "g" composed with "f" is written as "g ∘ f" a function from "X" to "Z" (notice how it is usually written in the opposite way to how people would it expect it to be as we will explain below).
The value of "f" given the input "x" is written as "f(x)". The value of "g ∘ f" given the input "x" is written "(g ∘ f)(x)" and is defined as "g(f(x))" (which means our way of writing "g" composed with "f" makes sense).
Here is another example. Let "f" be a function which doubles a number (multiplies it by 2) and let "g" be a function which subtracts 1 from a number.
These would be written as:
"g" composed with "f" would be the function which doubles a number and "then" subtracts 1 from it:
"f" composed with "g" would be the function which subtracts 1 from a number and "then" doubles it:
Function composition can be proven to be associative, which means:
Function composition is in general not commutative however, which means:
This can be seen in the first example where "(g ∘ f)(2) = 2*2 - 1 = 3" and "(f ∘ g)(2) = 2*(2-1) = 2".

Rene Kulitja

Rene Kulitja (born 1958), also known as Wanuny Kulitja, is an Aboriginal Australian artist. She works with a range of media, including paint, glass and ceramics. Her most famous design is probably "Yananyi Dreaming", which covers a Qantas Boeing 737.
Rene was born in 1958, in Ernabella, South Australia. Her family are Pitjantjatjara people, and her Pitjantjatjara name is Wanuny. She grew up in northern South Australia, and then moved to Docker River after she got married. When Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park was handed back to traditional owners in 1985, the couple moved to Muṯitjulu to work in tourism. Rene became involved in arts and crafts at the women's centre shortly after. She was a founding director of Walkatjara Art.
During the mid-1990s, Kulitja worked with other women artists on the interior design of the park's cultural centre. She also took a course on glasswork techniques at the University of South Australia, along with three other women. After a successful exhibition of work made using these new skills, Kulitja and the other women got a commission from the Ayers Rock Resort at Yulara for a panel of glass decorated with traditional designs.
In 2000, Kulitja was one of over 300 Aboriginal women from Central Australia to perform at the Opening Ceremony of the Summer Olympic Games in Sydney.
In 2002, Kulitja worked with Balarinji Studio in Sydney to design the outside surface of Qantas Boeing 737. The design she painted was of Uluṟu. It was based on traditional designs and sacred Dreaming legends. The fleet was launched on 14 February 2002, with a special ceremony performed by singers and dancers from Muṯitjulu. The word "(y)" means "to go" or "to travel" in Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara. It was the third Qantas aircraft to be painted in an Aboriginal design. Kulitja did something similar again in 2010, when a semi-trailer truck was decorated with another of her designs as part of a national roadshow by Maṟuku Arts.
Kulitja has held an important position within her community for several years. She has been a member of both the Muṯitjulu Community Council and the Board of Management of Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park. In 2006, she became the chairperson of Maṟuku Arts. In October 2007, she was elected for a two-year term as a director on the Ngaanyatjarra, Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara (NPY) Women's Council.
Rene's husband, Richard Kulitja, worked in the tourist industry for many years. In 2004, he accepted an international tourism award in Washington, D.C. on behalf of Aṉangu Tours. Several members of their family have been badly affected by petrol sniffing, which is a widespread problem amongst Aboriginal communities in central Australia. Their son was addicted to sniffing, and was reported to be getting help in 2006. Rene's two brothers also have permanent brain damage caused by their past addictions to the substance. Rene has spoken strongly about addressing the issue within the community.
Kulitja works with a range of media, including paint, glass, ceramics and "" (desert grass). She makes paintings, woven baskets, and glass and ceramic sculptures. An example of her glass work is shown in the National Gallery of Australia. It is a coolamon made of glass (rather than the traditional wood), and has been exhibited in several Australian galleries. She is also known for making traditional-style jewellery using modern techniques and media. Some of her jewellery work was featured on "The Oprah Winfrey Show" when Winfrey visited Uluṟu in December 2010.
Kulitja's work has been shown in many exhibitions across Australia. It has also been exhibited in Belgium and Japan.

Pokémon X and Y

Pokémon X and Y are two role-playing games (RPGs) in the "Pokémon" series made by Game Freak for the Nintendo 3DS. 
The games were announced by Nintendo on January 8, 2013. They were released on October 12, 2013. "X and Y" are the first ever 3D games in the main "Pokémon" series.
New starting Pokémon were revealed in the announcement video for the game. The starters for "X and Y" are the Grass-type Pokémon, Chespin, the Fire-type Pokémon, Fennekin, and the Water-type Pokémon, Froakie. The announcement video also showed two new legendary Pokémon, Yveltal, a bird-like Pokémon which has a shape kind of like the letter Y, and Xerneas, a deer-like Pokémon which has X-shapes in its eyes. Another Pokémon, Sylveon, is both a new Eevee evolution and an entirely new type called the Fairy-type, which is strong against Dragon-type Pokémon. Some older Pokémon, like Jigglypuff, Marill, and Gardevoir, have also been changed to be part Fairy-type. There is also a new gameplay element called Mega Evolution. Some Pokémon like Mewtwo, Blaziken, and Lucario are able to power up during a battle if they are holding a Mega Stone. Mega forms of Pokémon are stronger than their normal forms.

Kepler (spacecraft)

Kepler is a space observatory launched by NASA to discover Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. The spacecraft, named in honor of the 17th-century German astronomer Johannes Kepler, was launched on 7 March 2009. It has been active for as of , .
The Kepler mission is "specifically designed to survey a portion of our region of the Milky Way galaxy to discover dozens of Earth-size planets in or near the habitable zone and determine how many of the billions of stars in our galaxy have such planets". A photometer continually monitors the brightness of over 145,000 main sequence stars in a fixed field of view. This data is transmitted to Earth, then analyzed. The aim is to find periodic dimming caused by extrasolar planets which cross in front of their host star. As of January 2013, there are a total of 2,740 candidates.
Kepler is part of NASA's Discovery Program of relatively low-cost primary science missions. The telescope's construction and initial operation were managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. To start with, the mission lifetime was 3.5 years. In 2012, this was extended to 2016, partly due to difficulties in processing and analyzing the huge volume of data collected by the spacecraft.
The Kepler space telescope has had to give up its planet-hunting mission because its pointing system has problems which the engineers cannot fix.

<doc id="378837" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=378837" title="Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives">
Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives

The Speaker of the House of Representatives is the person in charge of the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Parliament of Australia. The person in charge of the upper house is the President of the Senate.
The current Speaker is Tony Smith. There have been two female Speakers, Joan Child and Anna Burke.
The office of Speaker was created by section 35 of the Constitution of Australia. The role of Speaker was copied from the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.
The Speaker is elected by the House of Representatives in a secret ballot. The Clerk of the Australian House of Representatives holds the election. There must always be a Speaker, and if the position becomes vacant, then an election must take place before the Parliament can do anything else.
In Australia the Speaker generally remains an active member of their party. They continue to attend party meetings, and at general elections they stand as party candidates. However, Sir Frederick Holder and Peter Slipper, resigned from their parties and sat as independents.
The Speaker can be opposed at a general election. Three Speakers, Groom in 1929, Nairn in 1943 and Aston in 1972 have been defeated at general elections. Because the Speaker is always a member of the governing party, they have not continued as Speaker following a change of government. The Opposition sometimes selects one of its own members for Speaker after a general election. This is a symbolic act, and the governing party always supports its own candidates.
Speakers do not have to resign from Parliament at the end of their term. Two Speakers, Makin and Scholes, have become Cabinet ministers after having been Speaker.
Most Speakers have been long serving party members. Four Speakers have been former government ministers Watt, Groom, Cameron and Sinclair. Martin had been a former Parliamentary Secretary. Snedden had been both a former minister and Leader of the Opposition. Holder and Watt were former state premiers.
The name "Speaker" comes from early times in the United Kingdom House of Commons. "Mr Speaker" was the Member of Parliament chosen to speak for them to the King. The first recorded use of the term "Speaker" was in 1377. In earlier times when the King was very powerful, he would usually only call the Parliament together in order to get it to agree to new taxes. The Speaker would report parliament decisions to the King. This was dangerous if it was not what the King wanted to hear. It was not uncommon for early speakers of parliament to be beheaded, with another being "murdered". This has led to the modern symbolic show of refusal by a Member on being elected Speaker. In early days a Member’s struggle to avoid being forced into the Chair could have been completely genuine. In Australia the tradition is continued by the act of the new Speaker being escorted to the Chair.
The Speaker's main duty is to be the person in charge of the House. He helped by two Deputy Speakers and a group of Acting Speakers. The second Deputy Speaker is elected from an opposition party. These often take charge during routine debates. The Speaker's role is to:
Australian parliaments can be very noisy and often members behave badly. The Speaker has powers to control their behaviour as part of the Standing Orders. The Speaker can tell a Member to leave the House for one hour. For more serious offences, the Speaker may "name" a Member. The Speaker will say "I name the Honourable Member for X." In Parliament Members are always called by the name of their electorate. The House then votes on a motion to remove the Member for 24 hours. The House also had the power to permanently expel a Member. This happened once to Hugh Mahon in 1920. In 1987 a new law was passed and Members can no longer be expelled from the Parliament.
Australian Speakers are supposed to be impartial; they are meant to be fair and not to take sides in arguments. They do not take part in debates and they do not usually vote, unless in a rare case the vote is tied. They do not speak out in public about party politics except as part of their own election campaign.
Although not an active political position, the Speakers see it as part of their duty to get the Government's legislation passed through the House. They usually agree with the Government on points of order brought up by Opposition members. If the members are unhappy with the Speaker they can try to pass motions of dissent, or even of no confidence. These are nearly always defeated as members vote to support their party. 
There have been several famous clashes between Speakers and the government.
In 2011, the Speaker Harry Jenkins survived after the House did not support his decision to name Liberal MP Bob Baldwin. The Government moved that Baldwin be suspended, but he was supported by the Coalition, independent MP Rob Oakeshott and WA Nationals MP Tony Crook. The vote on suspending Baldwin for 24 hours failed 71–72. Normally the Speaker would have resigned, but the House of Representatives immediately approved a motion of confidence in the Speaker which was passed. Speaker Jenkins continued in office.
There have been Speakers who were not members of the government. Former LNP member Peter Slipper became an independent when the Labor Government offered him the job in 2011. Frederick Holder was elected for the Free Trade Party at the first federal election in 1901. He resigned from the party and was an independent speaker until his death in 1909. After the 1940 election, the United Australia Party's Walter Nairn was speaker during the John Curtin's Labor government that was formed in 1941. Opposition MP Carty Salmon was the speaker for Andrew Fisher's Labor government after the 1910 election. At the 1913 election, Labor's Charles McDonald was asked to remain as speaker by the incoming one-seat-majority Commonwealth Liberal Party. He refused but became speaker again after Labor won the 1914 election. McDonald stayed in the job even when the Nationalist Party took government.
A Member who is elected Speaker is given the title 'The Honourable'. With the approval of the Sovereign, this title can be used for life. It is usually only given to those who have served as Speaker for three years or more. Harry Jenkins, was the first Speaker to ask that "The Hon." not be used for him. 
Copying the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, the traditional dress of the speaker is a Court dress. This can include a black silk gown (similar to a Queen's Counsel gown), a wing collar and a lace jabot or bands (another variation included a white bow tie with a lace jabot), bar jacket, and a full-bottomed wig. The wig used by the speaker was donated by Herbert 'Doc' Evatt when he was elected to the House in 1951. He had worn the wig when he was a High Court Justice (1930–1940). The wig is currently on loan from the speaker's office to the Museum of Australian Democracy. On formal occasions they may also wear court shoes and hose. The dress of Speakers has often changes according to the party in power, but it is the personal choice of the Speaker. All Labor party Speakers have worn business suits, following the example set by their first Speaker, Charles McDonald.
The Speaker, currently, no longer wears the full traditional dress. Billy Snedden (1976–1983) was the last Speaker to do so. The Labor practice resumed from 1983 until the election of the Howard Government in 1996. The new Speaker Bob Halverson chose to wear the court dress of the Speaker upon his election in April 1996, but without the wig. Speaker Ian Sinclair chose wore normal business dress during his brief term in 1998. However Speakers Andrew and Hawker brought back the wearing of the silk gown. Speaker Jenkins resumed Labor practice from 2007 until the election of Peter Slipper in late 2011. Speaker Slipper wore traditional dress with a white long tie or bow tie. He wore a wing collar with white bow tie and bands on the occasion of his first formal procession into parliament. Speaker Burke returned to the Labor practice of wearing normal business clothes.

The Division was drawn up on 11 May 1949, for the 1949 Federal election. It was named after Peter Lalor, the leader of the miners at the Eureka Stockade, and a former member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. 
Barry Jones was the Minister for Science under Bob Hawke and Labor National President. Jim Cairns, was the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister under Gough Whitlam. As Julia Gillard was Deputy Prime Minister prior to becoming Prime Minister, Lalor is the only federal electorate to have been held by two Deputy Prime Ministers.

Commentry

Commentry is a French commune. It is in the Allier department in the center of France. Today, about 6500 people live in the city. The city developed, because of the coal reserves that were found nearby. After the Second World War, a chemical industry developed. The other pillar of the industry was a steel mill, which is also in the city. In 1882, the first socialist mayor of France is elected in Commentry, Christophe Thivrier. In 1902, the Socialist Party of France was founded in Commentry. The city of COmmentry only lies 8 km from the geographical center of France itself.

Koobi Fora

Koobi Fora is a region around Koobi Fora Ridge, on the eastern shore of Lake Turkana, Kenya. It is in the territory of the nomadic Gabbra people. The term East Turkana can be used for the whole area.
The ridge is an outcrop of mainly Pliocene/Pleistocene sediments. It is composed of claystones, siltstones, and sandstones that preserve numerous fossils of land mammals, including early hominin species. The ridge is being eroded into a badlands terrain by a series of ephemeral rivers that drain into the northeast portion of modern Lake Turkana. 
In 1968 Richard Leakey established the Koobi Fora Base Camp on a large sandspit projecting into the lake near the ridge, which he called the Koobi Fora Spit. A survey and numerous excavations showed the region was a source of hominin fossils from the last 4.2 million years. Far exceeding the number of humanoid fossils are the non-humanoid fossils, which give us a look at the fauna and flora as far back as the Miocene.
In 1973, the government of Kenya reserved the region as Sibiloi National Park, establishing a headquarters for the National Museums of Kenya on Koobi Fora Spit. The reserve is well-maintained and is well-guarded by friendly but armed park police. Protection of sites and especially of wildlife are of prime concern.
Exploration and excavation are done by the Koobi Fora Research Project (KFRP), which collaborates with universities and individuals around the world.
The simple hierarchy of scientific places for Koobi Fora is the following: Koobi Fora is the region; the region is divided into fossil collecting areas; within fossil collection areas there are archaeological sites and hominid paleontological localities. 
Locating and referencing the hundreds of sites in the Koobi Fora region has been an ongoing process. The entire reservation was divided into somewhat over 100 numbered areas. In the year 2000 the KFRP went over to a GPS system.
Some notable areas are as follows.
The first archaeological site, i.e., FxJj 1, was found in Area 105. It is nicknamed the KBS site for Kay Behrensmeyer Site, after the researcher who first found stone tools there. This site is also the place where the first tuff was found, i.e., the KBS Tuff.
It is known as the location of skull 1470, discovered by Bernard Ngeneo in 1972, reconstructed by Meave Leakey, later reconstructed and named "Homo habilis" by Richard Leakey, as possibly the first of the genus "Homo", and finally "Homo rudolfensis". Richard Leakey found it 45 m below the 1.89 my KBS tuff; thus, it is older than that date, but is conventionally dated to it.
Searching for and finding fossils in such a large area is another difficult problem. One solution has been to organize all persons present into a group to sweep a designated area. Richard Leakey devised a method that produced better results: he organized and trained a search team of Kenyans, which became known as "the hominid gang", under the leadership of Kamoya Kimeu. They have discovered the majority of the fossil Hominins, which currently amount to over 200.
Koobi Fora is perhaps best known for its specimens of the genus "Homo", but those of the genus "Australopithecus" also have been found. The following species are represented:
"Australopithecus" and "Homo" seem to have coexisted in the region for about one million years. One possible explanation is different food sources. It is believed that "Australopithecus" became extinct and "Homo" went on to generate later species.
Large quantities of stone tools have been found at Koobi Fora both on the surface and in caches, which have dates of their own, but are seldom in association with hominins. No other candidates for their manufacture have been found, however. The tools are Oldowan and Acheulean. The Koobi Fora community has devised the following teminology to describe three local industries:
With the change from Olduwan to Acheulean technique, hominins got more of a return for a given output of energy and could do more. The chief technological development was the edge of the handax. The advantage of the "core reduction strategy" was more and thinner flakes per mass of cores. More and better flakes meant better use of carcasses and therefore a need for fewer carcasses, less hunting, etc. Moreover, the increased number of flakes available made ranging farther from the source of the stone possible and gave more staying power to the hunt.
Koobi Fora is underlain by Pliocene basalts and filled with nearly 600 meters of Pliocene-Pleistocene sediments, dating from about four-million to one-million years ago.
Most early human fossils and archaeological remains come from the upper portion of the Burgi Member, the KBS Member, and the Okote Member. The members reflect changing environments in the Turkana Basin, from lake and delta ones during Burgi Member times to rivers and floodplains in Okote Member times.
The stratigraphy of the Koobi Fora Formation is one of the best studied and calibrated in East Africa. Controversial dating of the KBS Tuff during the 1970s helped to spearhead the development of modern potassium/argon and argon/argon geological dating methods. In addition, the unique fusion between geochronology and mammal evolutionary studies has made the Koobi Fora Formation a standard for all of Pliocene-Pleistocene Africa.

Layne Staley

Layne Thomas Staley (August 22, 1967 – April 5, 2002) was an American musician. He was the lead singer of the rock band Alice in Chains. He was born in the city of Kirkland, Washington.
Layne Staley first played in a band called Sleze which consisted of Shorewood High School students as well as future members of the bands The Dehumanizers and Second Coming. The band morphed into Alice 'N Chains in 1986 and mostly played cover versions of Slayer and Armored Saint songs. Alice 'N Chains disbanded and Staley joined a funk band afterwards. The band needed a guitarist so Staley asked Jerry Cantrell to be a sideman for the band. Cantrell agreed but only if Staley joined his band. After the funk band disbanded, Staley joined Cantrell's band full-time and they renamed the band Alice in Chains.
While he was with Alice in Chains, They released their debut album "Facelift" which featured the hit single, "Man in the Box" which was written by Staley. They then released an EP called "SAP" on February 4, 1992 and released their second studio album "Dirt" on September 29, 1992. 
The band didn't tour for "Dirt" very long because of Staley's drug addiction. Cantrell often wrote the lyrics for the band but Staley wrote more songs as time went on and was eventually credited with writing half of the band's catalog until their fourth studio album, "Black Gives Way to Blue". When Staley wrote lyrics, they were often about dealing with his personal problems like drug use and depression.
The other band members decided not to tour for their third studio EP "Jar of Flies" because of Staley's condition becoming progressively worse. Staley decided that he would enter a rehabilitation clinic after Jar of Flies and started a side project with Mike McCready of Pearl Jam and Barrett Martin of Screaming Trees called The Gacy Bunch. They later changed their name to Mad Season. During his time in Mad Season, they released 1 studio album, "Above" which featured the singles "River of Deceit" and "I Don't Know Anything".
Staley's physical condition was changing during the hiatus of Alice in Chains and his addiction started to become more known to the public. Alice in Chains reunited to record the self-titled album "Alice in Chains", also commonly referred to as "Tripod" and it was released on November 7, 1995.
In October 1996, Staley's ex-fiancée, Demri Lara Parrott, died from complications caused by drug use. Her death made Staley even more depressed. He removed himself from the spotlight until he joined Alice in Chains at the Grammy Awards in 1997 after the song "Again" was nominated for "Best Hard Rock Performance". He recorded two songs for the Music Bank box set and producer Dave Jerden said that "Staley weighed 80 pounds…and was white as a ghost." 
Staley hardly left his condo from 1999 to 2002. 
On April 19, 2002, police kicked in Staley's apartment door to find Staley dead on his couch. His autopsy reported that a combination of heroin and cocaine known as a "speedball" that he had injected was a factor in his death. Staley was reported to be 6'1" and weigh only 86 pounds when his body was discovered, mainly because of his body decomposing due to him being discovered two weeks after his death.

Montluçon

Montluçon is a "commune" in central France on the Cher river. It is the largest "commune" in the Allier department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, although the department's "préfecture" is in the smaller town of Moulins.
The town is the historical capital of the old province of "Bourbonnais" and was part of the mediaeval Duchy of Bourbon.
Montluçon was built in the Middle Ages. The first mention of a place called "Monte Lucii" is from the eleventh century. Guillaume, son of Archambaud IV of Bourbon, built a castle on a small rocky hill on the Cher river.
The town, which formed part of the duchy of Bourbon, was taken by the English in 1171, and by Philip II of France in 1181; finally, in the 14th century, the English had to leave the town.
In the 14th century, Louis II de Bourbon re-built the castle and walls of the town. Montluçon and other Burgundian lands went back to the French crown in 1529, and Henry IV further improved the defenses.
La "commune" de Montluçon is on the northwestern part of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, on the northern part of the Massif Central; it is on the Cher river. It has an area of and its average altitude is ; at the city hall, the altitude is ..
The city is from Moulins, from Clermont-Ferrand and from Paris.
Montluçon is surrounded by the "communes" Saint-Victor, Désertines, Saint-Angel, Néris-les-Bains, Lavault-Sainte-Anne, Prémilhat and Domérat.
With a population of 38,072, Montluçon is the largest city of the Allier department. It has a population density of inhabitants/km.
The inhabitants of Montluçon are known, in French, as "Montluçonnais" (women: "Montluçonnaises").

Steel mill

A Steel mill or steelworks is an industrial plant where steel is manufactured. Steel is an alloy of carbon and iron. Usually steel is produced in two stages: First, iron ore is reduced (or smelted) with coke and limestone. This is done in a blast furnace, and the result is pig iron. The part that is not used for pig iron is carried on as "molten iron". Impurities are removed, and alloying elements such as manganese, nickel, chromium and vanadium are added to produce the exact steel required. Steel mills then turn molten steel into blooms, ingots, slabs and sheet through casting, hot rolling and cold rolling.

Lantern of the dead

A Lantern of the Dead is a free-standing structure much like a tower. They were built during the Middle Ages mostly in central France. In the upper part of the structure there is an opening, which can hold a light. Most of these larnerns were built in the 12th and 13th century. Their exact function is unclear, as there are no written sources about them. One of the theories states that they were built to satisfy different other beliefs, which had been around before Christianity. One of the ideas was that the deceased needed a light to find their way home. 
Lanterns of the dead exist in different forms: cylindrical, square, as a hexagon, or polygon, as a column. Sometimes they are attached to a chapel.

James M. Buchanan

James McGill Buchanan, Jr. (October 3, 1919 – January 9, 2013) was an American economist and educator. He is known for his public choice theory. His theories helped scientists figure out political science. Buchanan won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1968 for his theory.
Buchanan was born on October 3, 1919 in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. His ancestry includes Scottish and Irish. He was raised in Chicago, Illinois and in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Buchanan studied at University of Chicago, at the University of Tennessee, and at the State Teachers College, Murfreesboro.
Buchanan is the founder of a new Virginia school of political economy. Buchanan is largely responsible for the rebirth of political economy in the second half of 20th century.
The term "constitutional economics" was used by James M. Buchanan as a name for a new academic sub-discipline. Buchanan’s work in 1986 brought him the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his "development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making."
Buchanan rejects "any organic conception of the state" as superior in wisdom, to the citizens of this state." This philosophical position forms the basis of constitutional economics. Buchanan believes that every constitution is created for at least several generations of citizens. It must be able to balance interests of the state, society, and each individual.
In 2001 Buchanan received an honorary doctoral degree from Universidad Francisco Marroquín, in Guatemala City, Guatemala, for his contribution to economics.
The "New York Times" commented that the Nobel Prize-winning economist who championed public choice theory influenced a "generation of conservative thinking about deficits, taxes, and the size of government".
He was influenced by Frank Knight, Knut Wicksell, and by Ludwig von Mises. He has influenced Elinor Ostrom.
He was married to Ann Bakke from 1945 until his death in 2013. They had no children. Buchanan died on January 9, 2013, in Blacksburg, Virginia. He was 93 and he died from natural causes.

Vincent Forrester

Vincent Forrester (born 1952) is an Aboriginal Australian activist, artist and community leader. Forrester was a founding member of a number of Aboriginal organisations in central Australia. He lives at Muṯitjulu, where he has served as the chairman of the community council. During the 1980s, he served as an advisor on indigenous affairs to the governments of Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke.
Forrester has been a prominent political activist on issues affecting indigenous Australians for many years. He has been a strong critic of the Intervention in the Northern Territory, and the lack of economic and educational development in communities affected by it.
Forrester was born in 1952 in Alice Springs. His family is a mixture of Luritja and Arranda, but one of his grandfathers was Scottish. Vincent grew up on a cattle station in the Angas Downs area. He learned from his grandparents about the sacred legends associated with his country, and about bush foods and bush medicine. He went through initiation when he reached maturity.
As a young teenager, Forrester worked as a station-hand and stockman. Later, he worked in an abattoir. For three years, he served in the army in Townsville. At various other times he worked as a horse-riding clown and a rodeo rider.
Forrester's first language is Luritja, but he also speaks English and Arrernte.
Forrester has been an activist for Aboriginal Australians for most of his life. While growing up in Angas Downs in the 1960s, Forrester grew angry with what he saw as a lack of human rights for indigenous people. He rebelled against the government's assimilation policies during his school years, and then joined the campaign for indigenous land rights.
During the 1970s, after returning from the army, Forrester helped to set up the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress (CAAC), a health care service for indigenous people. He served as a field officer, and then later as its secretary. He also helped to set up the Central Land Council. In 1982, he represented Australia at the first session of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations, held in Geneva. In the middle of the 1980s, he helped to set up the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA). He has served as the organisation's treasurer, manager, and as a board member of its television network, Imparja.
In November 1977, aged in his mid-20s, Forrester became a founding member of the National Aboriginal Conference (NAC). He was elected chairman for the Northern Territory in October 1981. In this position, he would serve as an advisor to the governments of Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke on matters relating to indigenous people.
In 1979, a group called the National Aboriginal Government occupied Capital Hill in Canberra and set up the Tent Embassy. Kevin Gilbert and other protesters demanded that the federal government enter into negotiations for a treaty with Aboriginal people. Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser said he would only discuss the matter with the NAC, since it was the only elected body representing Aboriginals. Shortly after, the NAC began working on a draft proposal for this treaty. The government was opposed to the word "treaty", so the NAC chose to use a Yolgnu word, "Makarrata".
After his appointment as the NAC chairman for the Northern Territory, Forrester was put on the subcommittee in charge of drafting the "Makarrata" proposal. The proposal was for a treaty that recognised the sovereignty of Aboriginal nations in Australia. People wanted the government of Australia to deal with Aboriginal nations as it would deal with another sovereign nation under international law. Through the 1980s, the support for this treaty amongst Aboriginal people grew steadily. After talking with Aboriginal communities in his home region, Forrester was convinced that his people were in favour of a treaty. He argued, however, that the negotiations should be done under the oversight of the United Nations.
The NAC was dissolved by the Hawke government in 1985. Despite this, planning on the content and principles of the "Makarrata" proposal continued, with Forrester staying very involved. The campaign for the treaty remained strong through the 1980s, reaching its height in 1988. Forrester did an interview with Kevin Gilbert about it on CAAMA radio in 1989.
As more and more Aboriginal people around Uluṟu became involved in tourism, Forrester began working as a tour guide at Kings Canyon. He later became a ranger for Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park, and a mentor at Alice Springs Desert Park, training young Aboriginal people as guides and park rangers. He believed tourism and conservation had excellent opportunities for Aboriginal people. He was firmly against any economic development that comes from uranium mining. A lot of central Australian communities depend on grants to mining companies for income, but Forrester argues that this reliance must be broken.
While working in tourism, Forrester became outspoken about the lack of job opportunities for indigenous people living in the centre of Australia. Because of this, he said, the communities were living in poverty, and that the situation would continue to get worse until the federal government began talking to the communities directly. A lot of the problem, Forrester claimed, was due to racism. He called the situation "economic apartheid". He also acknowledged, however, that most people from indigenous-speaking communities lacked the literacy in English needed to keep a job. Most adults could not read and write, and the younger people did not have enough access to education. As a result, Forrester worked for several years in developing school curricula. In May 2011, the Ayers Rock Resort at Yulara was sold to the Indigenous Land Corporation. At the time of the sale, two out of the 700 people working at the resort were indigenous. At the start of 2013, it was reported that the number of indigenous workers had risen to 170; 35% of them were from Muṯitjulu.
Despite being critical of Malcolm Fraser whilst he was in office, Forrester later reflected that Fraser was one of the few Prime Ministers who sat down to talk with indigenous communities about issues affecting them.
In 2006, an ABC television program reported that children in Muṯitjulu as young as five had contracted sexually transmitted diseases and that girls were being prostituted for petrol. Indigenous Affairs Minister Mal Brough claimed that children at Muṯitjulu were being sexually abused. This caused serious anger from Muṯitjulu leaders. When Brough visited the community in October, Forrester shouted at the minister and demanded that he say sorry.
A formal inquiry later found that alcoholism and child sexual abuse were widespread in remote Aboriginal communities of the Territory. In response, in 2007, the government of John Howard introduced a series of measures aimed at addressing the problem. It is often referred to as "the intervention". The measures were seen as racially discriminatory by many people, including Forrester. He was already a leader in Muṯitjulu at the time. In February 2008, he travelled to the Tent Embassy in Canberra to hear the new Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, formally say sorry to the members of the Stolen Generations. While he was there, he talked with other indigenous people from the Territory about the effects of the intervention. The group then met with politicians at Parliament House to discuss their demands. Forrester called the intervention an "occupation" of indigenous lands by the military, and demanded that the polices be stopped. He encouraged Aboriginal people in the Territory to disobey the intervention laws in protest.
Forrester argued that the social problems can be avoided if the government provides the right kind of schools and services. Despite statistics showing that the number of sex crimes against children in Muṯitjulu was going down, Forrester maintained that the community was still in crisis. He pointed to the fact that the population of Muṯitjulu had also decreased by more than 40%; people were leaving. Forrester claimed that the government has been too slow in dealing with the source of the problem (jobs and education), and that life in Muṯitjulu has only gotten worse since the intervention laws.
In 2009, Forrester was made chairman of the Muṯitjulu Community Council. Since then, there have been major accusations of corruption against him by prominent members in the community.
Forrester began painting in the early 1990s. He paints stories from the Dreamtime. He has said that his art represents a story and a "spiritual legacy" for his descendants. Originally, he used acrylic paints, but he has since began using natural ground-up paint made at Uluṟu. Traditional methods, tools and techniques are used to grind natural pigments into powder form, and then mixed with a binder to become a thick, sticky paint. The colours Forrester uses in his paintings are the traditional colours used for ceremonial body paint.
His painting "Resurrection at Mutitujulu Waterhole", done using these methods, was chosen as a finalist for the Togart Contemporary Art Award in 2012. It depicts the waterhole at Uluṟu, and the story of (rainbow serpent). It was part of a series dedicated to women.

Palaeoptera

The Palaeoptera is the group of primitive (basal) winged insects which do not fold the wings back over the abdomen, as Neoptera do. Most of them are extinct; the living ones are the Ephemeroptera (mayflies) and Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies).
The Palaeoptera may not be monophyletic: the issue is not yet settled. On the other hand, the Neoptera definitely are monophyletic. 
The absence of wing-folding does not necessarily mean the Palaeoptera form a natural group. They may just be a group of insects that "are not Neoptera", in other words, a wastebasket taxon. As it stands, the relationship of the two living Paleopteran groups to the Neoptera is unclear.
Probably the concept of Palaeoptera will be changed to better reflect insect evolution. In any case, three main palaeopteran lineages, traditionally treated as superorders, are recognized. Of these, the Palaeodictyopteroidea themselves might also be a paraphyletic assemblage of very basal Pterygota.

Broughton, Nova Scotia

Broughton (2001 pop.: 24) was a former town in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality about 12 miles from the former city of Sydney, Nova Scotia. Expected to be a boomtown when first settled, it was mostly abandoned when mining operations failed. 
During the First World War, Broughton was used by the 185th Cape Breton Highlanders as training ground. During this time the famous Broughton Arms Hotel burned to the ground in April 1916. The Hotel is believed to have had North America's first revolving door.
Broughton was first settled at the turn of the 20th century as a mining town for the Cape Breton Coal, Iron & Railway Company, started by British mining engineer Thomas Lancaster and British businessman Col. Horace Mayhew which intended to develop the coal seam at Cochrane's Lake (aka: Loon Lake). The pair raised millions of dollars, mostly from English investors, and construction on the town was started, with streets laid out and a number of large official buildings constructed, including the Office Building, the Assistant Manager's House, the Broughton Arms Hotel and Crown Hotel. Remains of these substantial buildings can still be seen today, the scale of which giving an impression of the town's lofty ambitions. A railway was built connecting to the Sydney & Louisburg Railway at False Bay Head, continuing through Broughton Junction to Broughton, a distance of 4 ½ miles, construction beginning in 1905 and completed in 1906. Seemingly too much money and effort was spent on the details and modern conveniences of the "most up-to-date modern city", one of the first attempts at a planned community in Canada, and not enough attention to the actual mine operation. The company went bankrupt in 1907 after it failed to secure rail transportation to get its coal to port. It is said this was due to the opposition of the Dominion Coal Company, which would not allow its Sydney and Louisburg Railway to carry the coal produced by the mine.
The British pair left Cape Breton, abandoning the company and the town.
The community remained active until its peak in 1916. The army had taken over the hotels to house officers and men during the First World War. After the end of the war the community declined rapidly. Some residents still live in the area.
A long article, detailing this company's history, appeared in the "Montreal Daily Star", 25 May 1907.

Palaeodictyoptera

The Palaeodictyoptera were large flying insects which are now extinct. They were common in the Upper Carboniferous, and became extinct at the end-Permian extinction. Their size varied from large to huge. For example, "Mazothairos" had a wingspan of about . 
They were the first major group of herbivorous insects. They had long, beak-like, piercing mouthparts, and probably a sucking organ. The mouthparts match the signs of damage in fossil plant leaves and stems.
In addition to the normal four wings, they had two "pronota" in front. These pronota were smaller than the regular wings, but had wing veins just like the real things. They did not move up and down, so maybe they helped gliding. The Palaeodictyoptera are sometimes whimsically called "six-winged insects". The actual wings are often boldly marked: the patterns of colour can be seen in fossils.
These insects had paired "cerci" (singular: cercus) on their rear segment. The function of these is not clear. Cerci often serve as sensory organs, but they may also be used as weapons or copulation aids, or they may simply be vestigial structures. The cerci on some species was longer than the rest of the insect.

Robin Kankapankatja

Robin Kankapankatja (born around 1930) is an Australian Aboriginal artist. He worked for most of his life as a labourer and conservationist. He is the manager and senior traditional owner of Walalkara, a homeland and Indigenous Protected Area on the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands. He began work as an artist in 2004, aged in his 70s. His artworks are now held in several major galleries in Australia.
Robin was born at Walalkara, a place in the Great Victoria Desert near Kaltjiti, South Australia. His father was Pitjantjatjara from the land west of Watarru; his mother was Yankunytjatjara from Makiri, northwest of Walalkara. Robin grew up living a traditional, nomadic life in the area around Kaltjiti. The first time he saw a whitefella was when he was a young teenager. As a young man, he worked on the cattle stations at Welbourne Hill and Everard Park.
When he was much older, Robin moved back to Walalkara and set up an outstation for his family on his homelands. He lives there with his wife, Tyayangka, and his children. Kankapankatja is the senior traditional owner ("") of Walalkara. The people that live on this outstation are all part of his family. They are the land managers of Walalkara Indigenous Protected Area, a federally protected reserve created from an agreement between the Robin family and the Australian government. It covers of the Great Victoria Desert. Until 2008, Kankapankatja and his wife Tyayangka worked as rangers of the reserve. When they retired, their children took over its management.
Robin began working as an artist in July 2004, while he was at home recovering from surgery. His paintings and drawings are about Walalkara. They depict the landscape, animals, and spiritual Dreaming stories associated with it. He is also known for carving traditional tools, such as boomerangs, spears, spear-throwers and shields.
Since 2006, Robin's work has been shown in many exhibitions alongside other Kaltjiti artists. In 2007, he was featured at the Mossenson Galleries in Collingwood, Victoria. His work was featured as part of the annual "Desert Mob" exhibition in Alice Springs, in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. It was also exhibited in Adelaide at the Flinders University City Gallery in 2009, and the South Australian Museum in 2010.
In 2012, the Cross Cultural Art Exchange in Darwin held a solo exhibition of Robin's work. The exhibition was called ": this is my life from long ago". It showcased a series of drawings that depict Robin's memories from growing up in the bush, and the legendary journeys of his ancestors. In the same year, his work was also shown at the annual "Our Mob" exhibition in Adelaide, at an exhibition of Kaltjiti Arts in the Darwin Aboriginal Art Fair, and in Germany, in an exhibition at the ArtKelch gallery in Freiburg im Breisgau.
Examples of Robin's work are held in the collections of the Araluen Arts Centre, Flinders University, and the National Gallery of Australia. Others are held in the national Artbank collection, and several private collections, such as the Gallery Gabrielle Pizzi in Melbourne.

Slender Man

The Slender Man (or Slenderman) is a fictional creature from an Internet meme. It appears as a tall and thin man, wearing a black suit and tie. The man's face is usually blank, without any features. It is said to stalk, abduct, or scare people, especially children.
The Slender Man was originally created on the Internet forum Something Awful in 2009. It has grown into a kind of urban legend.
Slenderman usually has a nice suit in which he keeps bags to put organs in.
The Slender Man is described as very tall and thin with unnaturally long arms. It can extend its arms to scare people or capture them. It has a white, featureless head and appears to be wearing a dark suit. In images, the figure is often out of focus and blurry. The Slender Man is associated with the forest and has the ability to teleport.
The Slender Man was created during a contest on the Something Awful forums in June 2009. The goal was to change photographs using digital manipulation so that the pictures showed something supernatural. On 10 June, a forum poster with the user name "Victor Surge" uploaded two images in black and white. They were photographs of groups of children, to which had been added an obscured figure in the background: a tall, thin man with a blank face. Surge included short stories to go with the images, describing the disappearance of the children in the images. It gave the character the name, "The Slender Man":
One of two recovered photographs from the Stirling City Library blaze. Notable for being taken the day which fourteen children vanished and for what is referred to as “The Slender Man”. Deformities cited as film defects by officials. Fire at library occurred one week later. Actual photograph confiscated as evidence.<br>
1986, photographer: Mary Thomas, missing since June 13th, 1986.
These stories made it a work of fiction. Other users on the forum developed the character further, adding their own images or stories about "The Slender Man".
The Slender Man soon became very popular on the Internet. Many works of fanart, cosplay and fiction were created and spread from website to website. The first video series involving the Slender Man was published on YouTube. It is called "Marble Hornets", and is now one of the most popular Slender Man creations. Other YouTube serials about the Slender Man followed, including EverymanHYBRID and Tribe Twelve. In 2011, Markus "Notch" Persson, creator of the sandbox indie game "Minecraft", added a new character to the game. He named it the "Enderman" when many users on Reddit and Google+ commented on how similar it was to the Slender Man. A video game based on the Slender Man was released in 2012, named "Slender: The Eight Pages". Several popular variants of the game followed, including "Slenderman's Shadow" and "Slender Man" for iOS, which became the second most-popular app download. The sequel to "Slender: The Eight Pages", "Slender: The Arrival", was released in 2013.
A horror movie about the Slender Man, "Entity", was released in 2013. Another, "The Slender Man", was released free online. "Marble Hornets" is also being made into a movie.
The Slender Man was called "the first great myth of the web" by the BBC. The success of the idea has been ascribed to the Internet's ability to connect people with one another. It has allowed anybody to build on the story and develop the character, and also shape it into whatever frightens them most.

William Bland

Dr. William Bland (5 November 1789 – 21 July 1868) was a convict, doctor and surgeon, politician, farmer and inventor in New South Wales, Australia.
Bland was born in London in 1789. His father, Dr. Robert Bland, was an obstetrician. Bland joined the Royal Navy in 1810 as a surgeon and served on HM sloop "Hesper". While in Bombay, India he got into an argument with another officer, Robert Case. He challenged Case to a duel with pistols on 7 April 1813, and Case was killed. Bland was found guilty of murder and sentenced to seven years prison in Van Diemen's Land.
Bland arrived in Hobart on the ship 'Denmark Hill' in January 1814. He was sent to Sydney on the 'Frederick' on 14 July 1814. He was kept in the Castle Hill gaol for a short time where he was able to work as a doctor. He was pardoned on 27 January 1815. He set up business as a doctor. He married Sarah Henry in 1817, but they separated after a few months.
In 1818 he wrote critical comments about Governor Macquarie's treatment of farmers. He also made fun of Macquarie's desire to have his name on foundation stones. Bland's handwriting was recognised. On 25 September 1818 he was found guilty of libel, fined £50 and sent to prison for a year.
In 1830 he opposed attempts to sell large areas of crown land. He joined the Australian Landowners Association in 1831 to fight new land laws. When the Sydney Free Grammar School closed after only one year in 1826, Bland came up with a scheme to start a new school to replace it. Sydney College began in 1830. The foundation stone of a new building was laid by the Chief Justice, Sir Francis Forbes, in 1830. Bland was treasurer of the of the college from 1835 to 1844. In 1845 he became president. The buildings were sold to the University of Sydney in 1853. Sydney Free Grammar School and Sydney College were the beginnings of the current Sydney Grammar School which began in 1854.
He worked at the Benevolent Society as well as having a private medical practice. He dispensed medicines from his house until a proper dispensary was begun. He gave the Society advice on building a room to be an operating theatre and mortuary. He continued to assist at the Society until 1863.
He gave land and money to build a church at Ashfield.
He was an active writer. he wrote articles on new medical techniques which were published in the Lancet magazine. He wrote articles for the Australian Medical Journal on snake bite and dislocations. He edited the book "Journey of Discovery to Port Phillip, New South Wales" written by William Hovell and Hamilton Hume. He wrote a small book about how to prevent fires on ships carrying wool. He designed the "Atmotic Ship", a balloon filled with hydrogen and moved by propellors. A model of the atmotic ship was shown at the International Exhibition in London in 1851 and at Crystal Palace in 1854.
In 1835 the Australian Patriotic Association (APA) was formed. William Wentworth was president, and Bland was the secretary. His letters for the APA show Australia beginning to see itself as an independent nation. The main function of the APA was to draw up a constitution for New South Wales. The constitution was accepted by the British parliament and self government began in 1843.
He was an elected member to the new New South Wales Legislative Council twice (1843–1848, 1849–1850) and was appointed to the Council from 1858–1861
In 1849 Wentworth introduced a bill to create the University of Sydney. He named Bland as one of its first senators. Robert Lowe reminded members that Bland had been a convict and had killed a man in 1813. He said that such an important institution should not be run by convicts. The bill failed. Bland wanted to fight a duel but Lowe avoided it. The bill was re-introduced without Bland’s name and was passed.
A banquet was held in July 1856 to celebrate the grant of a new Constitution by the British government. Bland was the guest of honour. On 5 November 1858 he was given money and a candelabrum for his services to the community. He resigned on 21 March 1861 from the Legislative Council. 
In February 1846, Bland remarried a widow, Eliza Smeathman. He continued to work as a doctor until 1868. He was the founder and first president of the Australian Medical Association in 1859. A photograph was taken of him in 1845. This is the oldest surviving Australian photograph. In 1861 he was declared a bankrupt. He died in Sydney on 21 July 1868 of pneumonia, and was given a State Funeral.

Straw man

Straw man is a device or trope used in arguments. The phrase describes a misrepresentation or false version of an argument. This is an informal fallacy. The reasoning is flawed because it distorts issues. A false version of the other side's argument is proved wrong and it looks as if the real argument has been proved wrong. 
The straw man argument can have many forms. The fallacy of attacking a straw man can also arise from an honest mistake.
The origins of the term are unclear. An 1898 definition refers to men who stood outside courthouses with a straw in their shoe in order to indicate their willingness to be hired to give evidence in a court trial.
In the 1900 US presidential election campaign, the issue of Imperialism became a "straw man" issue when President McKinley accepted his party's nomination. Cartoonist William Allen Rogers focused on the destruction of this issue in a September issue of "Harper's Weekly".

André Roy

André Roy (born February 8, 1975) is an American-born Canadian retired professional ice hockey player.
Roy was born Mamaroneck, near Port Chester, New York. 
His mother, Heidi Golombeck, is from Germany. She moved to New York in 1969. There she met André's father, Gilles Roy. They got married a few weeks later. They left New York to go to Mamaroneck, near Port Chester, New York. They had three children: Marc, Kevin and André. When André was only two months old, the family moved to Sainte-Julienne, Quebec. This village is in the region of Lanaudière.
André started to play hockey at the age of five. He started playing hockey in Novice A category but he was much better than the other players of his team. During his third season, he became an Atom CC player. Roy did not weigh as much as the other players, but he was one of the tallest. Martin Saint-Louis, another professional hockey player, said that when André was young, he was one of the best players in Lanaudière.
During the winter, Roy stayed at the ice rink as much as possible. During the summer, he played hockey with rollerblades in the streets or in his driveway. According to his mother, he shot so many hockey pucks that he destroyed the cedar hedge and broke every window of his garage at least two times. In 1987, André entered in the Peewee BB category. His slapshots were so powerful that the other teams' goalkeepers were scared. The next year, Roy played in the Peewee AA category. During his third season in the Peewee category, Roy wanted to be in the AA team but problems he had with the AA's coach made it so that he could not. He met Steve Latreille, the BB's coach, during his third Peewee season. During his second season in the Bantam category, André tried to play in the AA team with the North's Sélects. Again, he could not because of issues with his ex-coach. He played in the CC category because there was no BB team that year in Saint-Jérôme. It was at this time that André started to forget his dream of playing in the NHL. He decided to quit hockey.
Three days later, Steeve Latreille called him because he wanted a player as good as Roy in his team. André accepted and became the CC team's captain. According to Latreille, Roy is the best player coached by him, and also a very selfless person who did not want to steal the show because of his talent. He did a very good job as a captain and supported his whole team. Roy's powerful shot also became faster as he played more. Roy was accepted in the AA Midget team of Saint-Jérôme but he became a player in the Select's CC Midget team because his father had already organized a hockey trip to Finland. That trip led to him getting to play with the Midget AA team for the next season. It is during this season that he really started to attract QMJHL's recruiters.
In 1993, Roy was selected by the Beauport's Harfangs (renamed in 1997 as the Quebec Remparts) in fourth round. One year later, at age 19, his agent took him to the NHL Entry Draft of 1994. During the last Memorial Cup, many NHL recruiters had seen Roy's potential and had met him. He was not certain that he would be recruited that year but he was selected by the Bostons Bruins in sixth round, as the 151th choice of the draft.

Flag football

Flag football is a version of American or Canadian football. The rules are not very different to those of the regular game. Instead of tackling players to the ground, the other team must pull a flag or flag belt off of the player carrying the ball. Flag football is a game played with no padding. Full contact is not allowed. The first game of flag football was played in the 1930s. It was later played on military bases in the 1940s as a game for the military. 
Flag football games are 36 minutes long. They are divided into two 18-minute halves. The only time the clock is stopped is in the last two minutes.
To score a touchdown, a player must cross the ball over the goal line. This is worth six points. There are two options for an extra point. The scoring team can try to run the ball into the endzone from either the 3 yard line or the 10 yard line. The 3 yd line is worth 1 point and the 10 yd line is worth 2. If the flag of the player who has the ball is pulled while that person is in their own end zone, it is called a safety. The other team gets two points for this.

Aquarius (constellation)

Aquarius is a constellation of the zodiac. It sits between Capricornus and Pisces. Its name is Latin for "water-carrier" or "cup-carrier", and its symbol is (Unicode ♒), which represents water. The astronomer Ptolemy listed Aquarius when he made a list of 48 constellations. It is also one of the 88 modern constellations.
Aquarius is a constellation also known as the Water Bearer and was a servant to the gods. He was also a human at one time. He was the son of King Tors. When he was human, his name was Ganymede. Usually when you see him in the sky, you can see him pouring water into the mouth of a fish; or Pisces.
There is a story of Ganymede when he was watching over his father’s sheep, he was captured and held captive by the Goddess of the Dawn.
In another version of the story, Zeus is captured by Ganymede. Than Zeus calls over his pet eagle to grab Ganymede and take him to the top of Mount Olympus and serve as a servant to the gods.
One man named Robert Graves thought that the origin of Aquarius was in Egypt. He thought that Aquarius represented the Nile River. He also thought that Aquarius was the God of the Nile. The Nile is just a river, but Robert thought that the river was water pouring out of Aquarius’ jar to make the Nile.
As a constellation, he comes after the constellation Capricornus just by one month and is south of the constellation Pegasus and north of Pisces, the brightest star in the night sky.

Tali Tali Pompey

Tali Tali Pompey (about 1945/1947 – 16 November 2011) was an Aboriginal artist from central Australia. She had a short career as an artist, beginning only in 2002. During this time, however, her work was taken in by several major public galleries.
Pompey was born on a sand dune near Finke, in the southern Northern Territory. This inspired her name; "" is the word for a sandhill in languages of the Western Desert. Pompey's parents were Yankunytjatjara people from lands further south, around Kalka and Kaṉpi in South Australia. Pompey grew up in the area around Finke, and then moved south to Ernabella when she was a young woman. At the time, this was a Christian mission set up for Aboriginal people coming in from the desert. While living in Ernabella, learned art and craft at the community's craft room. She learned how to sew, make batik, dye fabrics and spin sheep's wool to make rugs.
Pompey's husband, who she married at Ernabella, was a Pitjantjatjara elder and law keeper for the country around Kaltjiti. They moved to Kaltjiti after it was set up as an outpost in the 1960s. They had 8 children, including six boys and two girls.
Pompey started painting for the community's art centre, Kaltjiti Arts, in 2002. She painted regularly and became quickly noticed by critics. In 2003, one of Pompey's paintings, titled "Pita", was chosen as a finalist for the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award. Another of her works, "Para - Desert Gums", was chosen as a finalist for the competition in 2010.
In the ten years that she worked as an artist, Pompey's works became well represented in Australian collections. In 2007, she suffered a mild stroke, which affected the movement in her left hand. She recovered and then continued to paint up until her death. She died on 16 November 2011, in Alice Springs.
Pompey's paintings depict features of the central Australian landscape, such as sand hills, flowers and trees. These are painted with a soft-focus, hazy look. Most of her paintings are minimalist in style, combining basic shapes of colour with dotted fields or lines. She was known for thick brushstrokes and a wide use of colour.
Pompey's designs were also used in a series of rugs made by Kaltjiti Arts, which combined traditional Kashmiri techniques with Australian Western Desert designs.
Pompey's work has been exhibited widely in Australia, mostly in group exhibitions. The Mossenson Galleries in Melbourne held two solo exhibitions of Pompey's work. The first was in 2005. The second was in 2012, after her death, and showed a selection of her final works.
Examples of her paintings are now held in the National Gallery of Victoria, and the Art Gallery of South Australia.

The Division of Hunter is an Australian Electoral Division in the state of New South Wales. It is located in northern rural New South Wales. It covers much of the Hunter Valley region, including the towns of Singleton, Maitland, Muswellbrook, Cessnock and Denman. The Division was one of the original 75 divisions created for the first Federal election in 1901. The Division was named after Captain John Hunter, the second Governor of New South Wales.
In 2015 the Australian Electoral Commission said that the Division of Hunter would be abolished at the next election. Because of population changes, New South Wales loses a division, and a new one will be created in Western Australia. The boundaries of many NSW divisions will have to be changed, and the area covered by Hunter will be added to nearby divisions. Under AEC rules however, names of the original 1901 divisions should be kept, so the Division of Charlton will be renamed Hunter.
The seat has been held by the Labor since 1910. Famous members include the first Prime Minister Edmund Barton, and Opposition Leaders Matthew Charlton and Dr H.V. Evatt. Joel Fitzgibbon, Minister for Defence, took over the seat when his father, Eric Fitgibbon retired in 1996.

Mary Leakey

Mary Leakey (6 February 1913 – 9 December 1996) was a British archaeologist and anthropologist, who spent much of her life working in East Africa, in Tanzania and Kenya.
She discovered the first fossilized "Proconsul" skull, an extinct primate. They had a mixture of Old World monkey and ape characteristics, and their position in the evolution of the apes is still not clear. Leakey also discovered the robust "Zinjanthropus" skull at Olduvai Gorge. 
For much of her career she worked together with her husband, Louis Leakey, in Olduvai Gorge, uncovering the tools and fossils of ancient hominins. She developed a system for classifying the stone tools found at Olduvai. She also discovered the Laetoli footprints. In 1960 she became director of excavation at Olduvai and subsequently took it over, building her own staff. After the death of her husband she became a leading palaeoanthropologist, helping to establish the Leakey tradition by training her son, Richard, in the field.
Leakey served her apprenticeship in archaeology under Dorothy Liddell at Hembury in Devon, 19301934, for whom she also did illustrations. In 1934 she was part of a dig at Swanscombe where she discovered the largest elephant molar known at the time in Britain, but needed assistance to identify it.
The years 1935 to 1959, spent at Olduvai Gorge in the Serengeti plains of Northern Tanzania, yielded many stone tools from primitive stone-chopping instruments to multi-purpose hand axes. These finds came from Stone Age cultures dated as far back as 100,000 to two million years ago.
The Leakeys unearthed a "Proconsul africanus" skull on Rusinga Island, in October 1948. 
In 1960, unable to leave the museum except on weekends, Louis appointed Mary director of excavation at Olduvai. She brought in a staff of Kamba tribesmen, instead of Kikuyu, who, she felt, took advantage of Louis. The first, Muteva Musomba, had kept her children's ponies. He recruited Kamoya Kimeu among others. Mary set up Camp 5 under Jonathan's direction. He was 19. From then on she had her own staff and associates.
Mary picked and sieved at the site from early morning dressed in old clothes, chain smoking cigarettes, always surrounded by her Dalmatian. She and Louis communicated by radio. On weekends he drove non-stop at high speed the 357 miles between Olduvai and Nairobi. The teen-age boys, Richard and Philip, were on site holidays and vacations.
After Mary's husband died, she continued her work at Olduvai and Laetoli. It was here, at the Laetoli site, that she discovered Hominin fossils that were more than 3.75 million-years-old. She also discovered fifteen new species of other animals and one new genus.
From 1976 to 1981 Leakey and her staff worked to uncover the Laetoli hominid footprint trail which was left in volcanic ashes some 3.6 million years ago. The years that followed this discovery were filled with research at Olduvai and Laetoli, the follow-up work to discoveries and preparing publications.

Laetoli

Laetoli is a site in Tanzania, dated to the PlioPleistocene. It is famous for its hominin footprints, preserved in volcanic ash. The site of the Laetoli footprints is 45 km south of Olduvai gorge. It was excavated by archaeologists Louis and Mary Leakey in 1978. “The Laetoli Footprints” got a lot of attention from the public because they are convincing evidence of bipedalism in Pliocene hominins.
Dated to 3.6 million years ag,o they were the oldest known evidence of hominin bipedalism. Now older evidence has been found, such as the "Ardipithecus ramidus" fossils. The footprints and skeletal structure excavated at Laetoli were clear evidence that bipedalism evolved before enlarged brains in hominids. Although it is debated, it is believed the three individuals who made these footprints belonged to the species "Australopithecus afarensis". Together with footprints were other hominin and animal skeletal remains and Acheulean artifacts (hand-axes).
After debate, it was decided that "Australopithecus afarensis" is the species of the three hominins who made the footprints at Laetoli. This is based on the reconstruction of the foot skeleton of a female "A. afrarensis" hominin. Detailed footprint analysis compared both human and bipedal animals such as bears and primates. Gaits (stride pattern), and foot structure were analysed. Step length, stride length, stride width and foot angle showed that "A. afarensis" was more human-like in gait than ape-like.
"A. afarensis", then, is an obligate bipedal hominid. Its brain size was very similar to that of modern chimpanzees and gorillas. So, in one important respect it was like the genus "Homo" since it was bipedal. That means it was adapted to living in open woodland and savannah, not tropical rain forest. On the other hand, it had a brain about the size of an ape. This situation, where different traits of an animal evolve at different rates, is known as mosaic evolution.
The oldest hominin footprints in Europe are in Britain. They are about 800,000 years to a million years old. They were found on Happisburgh beach, East Anglia.
The archaeologists describe them as "the oldest known hominin footprint surface outside Africa at between ca. 1 million and 0.78 million years ago". The site in known for its preservation of sediments with early Pleistocene fauna and flora. Since 2005 flint tools have been found. This means humans occupied northern Europe at least 350,000 years earlier than was thought before.

This also means that until you are debating a definition of God that is able to be proven false, you might as well be debating about the word "Fob".

John James "Jean" Charest (born 24 June 1958) is a French Canadian politician. He was Premier of Quebec from 2003 until 2012 under the Quebec Liberal Party. 
Charest was born and grew up in Sherbrooke. Before politics, he worked as a lawyer. He received his diploma from the University of Sherbrooke in 1981, and was admitted to the Bar of Quebec the same year. After 3 years of working in court, Charest decided to join the Conservative Party of Canada in 1984. He was only 26 years old when he was elected as the representative of Sherbrooke.
Jean Charest had joined the Conservative Party of Canada in 1984. In the same year, he was appointed as Assistant Deputy Chair of Committees of the House of Commons.<ref name=bio/ On June 1986, he joined the Cabinet of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. He was the youngest person to serve in the Cabinet. He was given the job of Minister of State for Youth. Charest was re-elected in 1988, and served as Minister of State for Fitness and Amateur Sport.
In 1984, the Prime Minister of Canada, Brian Mulroney, promised that Quebec would sign the Canadian Constitution, which every other province had already signed two years before. Jean Charest was very involved in this project, but it did not succeed.
In 1995, Quebec was governed by the Parti Québécois, who started a referendum about whether Quebec should stay as a part of Canada. In others words, the population had the choice of staying or leaving the country. Jean Charest was against the idea of Quebec leaving the union. The results were very close, but Quebec stayed as part of the country.
During the 1990s, the sovereignty movement was at its height. Jean Charest, who was a big part of the "No" campaign in 1995, had won the support of many federalists from Quebec. This is why he joined the Liberal Party of Quebec in 1998, as the leader of the party. In 1998, Charest participated at his first election as a leader of a party. He received more votes than his opponent, but did not reach the majority. He stayed as official Leader of the Opposition until 29 April 2003.
Charest won the next election and became Premier of Quebec on the 29 April 2003 by receiving 45.99% of the votes from the electors. Mario Dumont from the "Action Démocratique du Québec" and Bernard Landry from the "Parti Quebecois" were his opponents. The Liberal Party won 76 out of 125 seats.
During his government, there were crises with the housing industry and university funding. Charest was not able to lower taxes as he had promised during his campaign. In the 2008 election, the Liberal Party under Jean Charest got re-elected as the government, with 66 out of 125 seats and 42% of the votes from Quebec's electors. Charest himself was less popular in this election than the other one before. He gained 33.08% of the votes from the electors.
The popularity of Jean Charest dropped down very quickly. On 4 September 2012, Charest had been defeated and he decided to quit. 
After his resignation, Jean Charest decided to give more time to his family and begin working again as lawyer. At least five law firms have shown interest in his services, especially one in Toronto. 
At the age of 18 years old, Jean Charest met Michèle Dionne who became his wife. They met while they were studying in Sherbrooke. Michèle Dionne had been considerate as a big part of his career, she has supported and has influenced many of his choices while he was in politics. Amélie, Antoine and Alexandra are their 3 children.

A chairlift is a type of public transport. It is like a chair that runs on cables. The cable is placed over the chair to lift it from the ground and they run between two (or more) stations. The cable is moved around by motors and lifted from the ground by towers. There are many chairs on the cable so that many people can be transported.
Chairlifts are found in skiing resorts, where they make skiers go up the mountain. They are sometimes better than gondola lifts because the skier does not need to remove the skis. He/she can sit down on the chair and then leave it at the top of the mountain very quickly. Old chairlifts are small and slow. Newer ones can carry up to 8 people. They are also faster overall, but they slow down at the station, making it easier to get on and off. Sometimes they even have a glass bubble that can be closed to keep people warm inside.

Diverticulitis

Diverticulitis is a disease of the digestive system. It is caused by inflammation of pouches (diverticula) in the walls of the bowel. It usually occurs in the large intestine. Diverticula can also be in the upper digestive tract at the level of the esophagus, stomach and small intestine.
Symptoms of diverticulitis depend on the extent of inflammation in the intestine. Diverticulitis can be very painful. The pain is usually present in the lower abdomen on the left side. People with diverticulitis can also have nausea, vomiting, difficulty or pain while passing urine and changes in bowel habits.
One of the complications of diverticulitis can be the formation of an abscess in the abdominal cavity. The inflammation or infection can then reach the abdominal wall and causes peritonitis. This infection can also spread to other parts of the body such as organs near the intestine, causing sepsis, which is dangerous. In addition, a fistula may form between the intestine and other organs. Diverticulitis may also cause a blockage in the colon.
To prevent diverticulitis, it is important to be active and to have a diet rich in fibers. These include eating (fruits, vegetables, legumes and cereals). It is also possible to reduce the risks of diverticulitis in several ways: chew foods before swallowing, defecate as soon as you feel the need, eat less fats and meats, do more physical activities, eat probiotics and drink water regularly.
To diagnose diverticulitis, it is important to do a barium enema X-ray to see the shape of the intestine wall. Diverticula can be seen with a axial tomographie scan (CT scan). It is also possible to prescribe an abdominal radiograph to indicate if there is a perforation. After the acute phase or absence of acute diverticulitis, the doctor can prescribe a colonoscopy to look at the colon and determine the evolution of the disease.
The resection of the colon is the procedure most often used to treat severe diverticulitis. It is also possible to do a resection of the diseased part of the colon and make a colostomy. In fact, if a diverticulitis is too large, a colostomy could be necessary either temporarily or permanently.

Show jumping

Show jumping is an equestrian event that uses English riding. The rider and his horse must complete an obstacle course with certain rules made by the International Federation of Equestrian sports. The sport was born in the 18th century by fox hunters when England introduced fencing laws. Hunters were now obligated to jump fences and this has become a very popular activity. In 1912, show jumping made its first appearance in the Olympic Games. Show jumping is one of the very few sports where men and women are completely equal in competitions. In this sport, you need a muscular horse with a good cardiovascular endurance. Also, it must have a quick and stable temperament for the best performance. The breeds that are the most sought for this sport are Selle Français, Anglo-Arabe, Oldenburg, Warmblood (including Holsteiner and Hanoverian), Thoroughbred and Trakehner.
To win the first place, the rider and his horse must complete the course as quickly as possible without making any mistakes. A fault or mistake occurs when the horse knocks down a fence or obstacle or if it disobeys; such as refusing to jump or makes a run-out. In fact, if a fault occurs the rider receives a penalty and loses automatically four points per mistake. In addition, a rider can lose some points if he exceeds the given time; a penalty is deduced at each exceeding second. Also, a rider can be eliminated because of a fall down or does not do the course correctly. The course is established in advance by the course designer. A designated judge decides whether the rider is eliminated or not and if he is, the judge decides when.
The riders who complete a course without any mistake can proceed to the next step which is the jump-off. It is a shorter race and again the goal is to complete the course as quickly as possible and without making any mistake. The rider who has the best time wins the competition. If mistakes are made, seconds are added to the final time and this is why only the time score determines the winners.

Great highland bagpipe

The Great Highland bagpipe is a four-reed woodwind instrument from Scotland. The instrument is made of a leather or synthetic bag. The three drones are single-reed instruments and make harmonies. The chanter is a double-reed instrument used to play the melody. The instrument also has a blowpipe used to inflate the bag.
The bag is filled with air by the player to inflate it and flow air into the drones and the chanter. The bag used to be made of leather (sheepskin or cow) but is now commonly made of synthetic material (Gore-Tex) for the ease of maintenance. The blowpipe is a simple pipe used to inflate the bag with the player’s breath. 
The great highland bagpipe has three drones used for harmonies. The big one is call “bass drone” and the two little one are called the tenors. These three drones are tuned on the same note and give the background sound that harmonizes with the chanter. The length of the drones can be adjusted to tune them. If the length is shorten, the pitch will be sharper, if it’s lengthen, the pitch will be lower. 
The chanter is a conical bored instrument with height holes in it. This instrument has been made of wood since the instrument's origin but is now made of plastic in some cases. The player opens or closes some of these holes with his fingers to give the melody. 
To play the instrument, the player (called a bagpiper or a piper) will inflate the bag and will place it under his left arm when the bag is fully inflated. The piper will now keep the pressure in the instrument with his arm. When he has to stop breathing in the bag, he’ll use his elbow to press the bag and keep the pressure on. This way of playing gives the opportunity to the player to play music during a long period of time without stopping for the need of breathing. Once the instrument is inflated, the piper have to tune one of the drones to match the chanter and, after that, he'll tune drones to match them together. If the piper do this operation carefully, he will be able to have a perfectly balance instrument. Once it's done, the player can start playing his instrument.

Moral equivalence

Moral equivalence is a term used in political arguments or debate. It is an informal fallacy. The phrase describes a kind of indirect proof, but the reasoning is flawed because it distorts issues. It draws comparisons between different things to make a point that one is just as bad as the other or just as good as the other. 
The user of the term imagines a kind of independent position above or beyond the two contenders. The moral equivalence theory allows someone using the term to appear both objective and detached at the same time.
The general form of the context for the use of the trope is 
The concept of moral equivalence is not a term of philosophy; rather, it is only a logical fallacy used in arguments.
It is usually to suggest a moral or ethical hierarchy for two sides in a conflict -- that one is better or worse than the other. The term originates from a 1906 speech by William James. The title of the speech was "".
The term's popular use was expanded by Jeane Kirkpatrick, who was US ambassador to the United Nations when Ronald Reagan was President of the United States. In 1966, Kirkpatrick published "The Myth of Moral Equivalence" which responded to the argument that there was "no moral difference" between the Soviet Union and democratic states.

Condenser (apparatus)

A condenser is a device used in the laboratory to cool hot gases into liquids. It is usually a long, circular glass tube. Inside the tube there is another, smaller tube. The hot gas goes through the smaller, inside tube, while in the outside one cold water goes around. Water can be put in from the tap, and goes from the bottom to exit at the top. This makes sure the tube is always full of water, so that cooling is quick.
A condenser is used for example in distillation, where the hot vapour needs to be cooled down back to liquid to be collected. It is also used in reflux where it makes sure that the solvent used does not boil and go away.

Les Colocs

Les Colocs is a Canadian rock band. It was formed in Montreal, Quebec in 1990. “Les Colocs” became well-known by playing different kinds of music, and because of its unique live performances.
In October 1990, André “Dédé” Fortin and Louis Léger were in the band “Cha Cha and the Chain Gang.” They left that band and began “Les Colocs” in Montreal. They gave their first show at the Tallulah Darling for the International Festival of Rock. 
One of the band's members, Marc Déry, left Les Colocs to create his own band, the Zébulon. Les Colocs put an advertisement in the newspaper looking for a new band member, and Serge Robert answered the ad. He became the band's bass player. 
After a few shows, Les Colocs' guitarist, Louis Léger, left. Mike Sawatzky took his place. 
The name "Les Colocs" was made official in 1992 at the “Festival international d'été de Québec." Les Colocs was the opening act, with André Fortin, Mike Sawatsky, Jimmy Bourgoing, Patrick Esposito di Napoli, and Serge Robert performing. 
In 1992, the band signed their first contract with the record label BMG Music Canada.
In 1993, the band's first album, "Les Colocs", was released. It sold over 150,000 copies. 
In October 1993, Les Colocs won four Félix awards. Two of these awards were for being group of the year and revelation (new surprise) of the year. 
In 1994, the band's harmonica player, Patrick Esposito di Napoli, died of AIDS. 
In 1995, Les Colocs made their second album. Dédé Fortin decided on a special release date because he is a strong separatist- he believes that Quebec should be separate and independent from Canada. He decided to release the second album on October 30th, 1995, which was the date of the second referendum on Quebec sovereignty. 
Some time later, Dédé decided to fire Serge Robert from the band. A year later, Les Colocs hired André Vanderbiest.
In May 1998, Les Colocs made the third and last album that would come out during Dédé Fortin's life. It was called "Dehors Novembre". The album is dedicated to Patrick Esposito Di Napoli, who had died 4 years before. In this album, like the others, the lyrics are dark, and some people say that they show the singer's feelings of culpability and despair. The album sold over 100,000 copies throughout Quebec.
In November 1998, Les Colocs won the Félix award for rock album of the year. 
On May 8, 2000, André “Dédé” Fortin killed himself. This ended the group.

Archedictyon

Archedictyon (plural = archedictya) is the name of a hypothetical scheme of wing venation of the common ancestor of all winged insects.
The nature of the archedictyon is an important in the taxonomic classification of the large, primitive Palaeozoic insects known as Palaeodictyoptera. It was used for this purpose as early as 1854. A National Museum of Natural History database for the study of ants, wasps, bees and termites describes the archedictyon as:
...the primitive original vein network [of] the wings of many of the most ancient insect fossils; the complex network of irregular veinlets between the veins in the outer [three-quarters] of both wings, including the anal lobe.
According to a 1999 paper on the evolution of flght in Palaeoptera the cross veins of some Palaeodictyoptera may be an adaptive feature.
The archedictyon is believed to have contained between six and eight longitudinal veins, but current understanding of the design is based on a combination of fossil data and speculation.
The "Comstock-Needham system" designed by two entomologists describes these veins and their branches:
Crossveins are named based on their relative position to the more prominent longitudinal veins:
In extant insects, the term implies a retention of primitive characteristics but "not necessarily a simplicity of form". Modern insects with wings to which the term "archedictyon" has been applied include the termite "Mastotermes darwiniensis" from Australia and the praying mantis "Orthodera novaezealandiae". from New Zealand.
The term is also used in the discussion of phasmids. Then it refers to a network of non-directional veins in the costal region of the wing or in the elytron.

Elytra

Elytra are the modified, hardened front wings of beetles and some bugs (Heteroptera). In most true bugs, the forewings are called hemelytra, as only the basal half is thickened while the apex is membranous. 
The elytra act as protective wing-cases for the hind wings underneath, which are used for flying. To fly, a beetle opens the elytra and then extends the hindwings, flying while still holding the elytra open, though some beetles in the families Scarabaeidae and Buprestidae can fly with the elytra closed.
In some groups, the elytra are fused together, and the insect is flightless. Some of the ground beetles (family Carabidae) are a good example of this.

Leaving group

In chemistry, a leaving group is an atom or molecule that leaves another molecule during a reaction. This reaction can be for example a nucleophilic substitution. In this case the leaving group gets a pair of electrons. Some leaving groups are better than others. This is because some atoms or molecules like getting extra electrons. The halides are a good example of good leaving groups.
The type of leaving group can change the type of reaction that happens. For example, bad leaving groups make an SN1 reaction more difficult, while they make an SN2 reaction easier.

Sigma bond

A sigma bond (σ bond) is a type of chemical bond. It is the strongest one of the covalent type. In a sigma bond, the atomic orbitals from two atoms which are nearby go one on top of each other. This is different from a pi bond where they touch sideways. This is why a sigma bond is stronger. Sigma bonds can involve s, p, d or f orbitals. They must however be of the right symmetry to be able to form the bond.
Since the σ bond is strong, the bonding orbital is low in energy. This also means that the antibonding orbital σ* is high in energy.

During the steroid allegations involving WWE owner Vince McMahon Jr. in 1992, Graham went on The Phil Donahue Show, admitting that he was avid user of steroids and blamed the WWF for his addiction although these drugs were not yet illegal in the 1970s. The incident caused a rift between Graham and McMahon which lasted for over ten years. 
He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2004 by Triple H. He later announced that he wanted his name removed from the WWE Hall of Fame because of his general dissatisfaction with the way professional wrestling had developed.

Butterfly McQueen

Thelma "Butterfly" McQueen (January 7, 1911 – December 22, 1995) was an American actress. She was originally a dancer. McQueen first appeared on screen in 1939, as "Prissy", Scarlett O'Hara's maid in the movie "Gone with the Wind". She continued as an actress in movies through the 1940s, then moving to television acting in the 1950s.
Butterfly was born Thelma McQueen in Tampa, Florida. She was planning to become a nurse until a high-school teacher suggested that she try acting. McQueen studied with Janet Collins and went on to dance with the Venezuela Jones Negro Youth Group. Around this time she received the nickname "Butterfly" because of her constantly moving hands in the Butterfly Ballet in a production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream". She had always hated her birth name, and later legally changed her name to Butterfly McQueen. She performed with the dance troupe of Katherine Dunham. She made her professional debut in George Abbott's "Brown Sugar".
McQueen's first on-screen credited role was "Prissy", the young maid in "Gone with the Wind". McQueen did not enjoy playing the part and felt it was demeaning to African Americans.
She also played a small part as a sales assistant in "The Women" (1939). She also played "Butterfly", Rochester's niece and Mary Livingstone's maid in the Jack Benny radio program, for a time during World War II. She appeared in a small role in "Mildred Pierce" (1945) and played a supporting role in "Duel in the Sun" (1946). By 1947, she had grown tired of the ethnic stereotypes she was required to play. She then ended her movie career.
From 1950 until 1952 she played "Oriole", another racially stereotyped role, on the television series "Beulah". In a lighter moment, she appeared in an episode of "The Dating Game" in 1969.
Offers for acting roles began to decline around this time, and she devoted herself to other pursuits including political study; she received a bachelor's degree in political science from City College of New York in 1975. In 1979 McQueen won a Daytime Emmy Award for her performance as Aunt Thelma, a fairy godmother in the "ABC Afterschool Special" episode "The Seven Wishes of Joanna Peabody." She had one more role of substance in the 1986 movie "The Mosquito Coast".
McQueen never married or had any children. She lived in New York in the summer months and in Augusta, Georgia during the winter.
In July 1983, a jury awarded McQueen US$60,000 in a judgment stemming from a lawsuit she filed against two bus-terminal security guards. McQueen sued for harassment after she claimed the security guards accused her of being a pickpocket and a vagrant while she was at a bus terminal in April 1979.
McQueen died at age 84 on December 22, 1995 at Augusta Regional Medical Center in Augusta. She died from burns she had gotten when a kerosene heater she tried to light malfunctioned and burst into flames.
A lifelong atheist, she donated her body to medical science and remembered the Freedom From Religion Foundation in her will.

Northern pygmy owl

The Northern pygmy owl ("Glaucidium gnoma") is a small owl native to North and Central America.
The Northern pygmy owl is small and has a long tail. It has shiny yellow eyes, yellow feet, and small tuffs of fur with its ears. Its feathers are a reddish brown speckled with white. Like all of the members of its family, it has fake eye spots that are black and outlined in white on the back of its neck. The Northern Pygmy Owl's stomach is white with black stripes. The Northern Pygmy Owl tends to perch in a diagonal position rather than an upright position.
Northern pygmy owls nest and breed in evergreen-filled forests and woodlands with variety. They normally mate in Spring. They prefer to live in tree cavities or old woodpeckers' holes. They do not add anything to their nest. The mothers keep three or four eggs warm. But she waits for all of the eggs to be laid before she starts incubating. That is an inimitable trait of northern American owls. While the female owl takes care of the eggs, the male consistently brings food for them. After the eggs hatch, the mother takes care of them for about one week. The baby owls will gain the ability to fly in about twenty-seven to twenty-eight days.
Northern pygmy owls are widespread across North America. They usually live in the scattered areas with less trees, rather than large parts of land with lots of unbroken trees. Northern pygmy owls are most active during the dawn or the dusk. Northern pygmy owls can also be seen in the daytime, when the weather is overcast. They like to perch on conifer or small trees, or in a snag. When they perch, they bob their head up and down, and flick their tails, and hold their tails to one side.
One third of the pygmy owls' diet are rodents, large insects, and small birds. Northern pygmy owls are very aggressive hunters, so fast that they can catch their prey in flight.

Greenwood, Nova Scotia

Greenwood is a village in the western part of Kings County in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley.
Greenwood was a small hamlet south of the Dominion Atlantic Railway's Kingston Station. In 1942, the Royal Air Force created the RAF Station Greenwood and built an aerodrome on nearby farmland for a facility to train aircrew under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. The Royal Canadian Air Force took over the facility in 1944. It was renamed RCAF Station Greenwood, a name it kept until the February 1, 1968 unification of the Canadian Forces. Then the airfield and related facilities were renamed CFB Greenwood.
During the 1970s–2000s, the village of Greenwood grew in population, as many other air force bases in eastern Canada closed and their aircraft and personnel moved to CFB Greenwood.
Now, the village and base's combined population is about 4,500. The village has many services and is also the location of the Greenwood Mall, the largest shopping centre in the western part of the Annapolis Valley

Havre Boucher

Havre Boucher () is a Canadian village in Antigonish County, Nova Scotia.
The village takes its name from "Havre Boucher", a natural harbour that opens onto St. George's Bay to the north. The original community of Havre Boucher is located to the west side of the harbour, although it now includes the communities of Auld's Cove, Cape Jack, East Havre Boucher, West Havre Boucher, Frankville and Linwood.
Havre Boucher is a rural area, largely dependent upon the fishing industry, as well as serving as a service centre for local communities.
The construction of the Canso Causeway, which opened in 1955, saw the Canadian National Railway mainline from Truro-Sydney diverted from Linwood north through Havre Boucher and Cape Jack, before following the Strait of Canso to the causeway. Before 1955, the railway ran from Linwood to Mulgrave where a ferry service operated to Point Tupper. Havre Boucher saw the construction of a large railway yard, which remains in operation today by the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway.
Havre Boucher is one of Nova Scotia's 22 incorporated villages, offering its residents political control through an elected governing body known as a "village commission" which operates under the Nova Scotia Municipal Services Act.

Water gardens

A water garden is a garden in which the chief thing, interest, and attraction is water and plants that live in water. The water may be put in a fountain, a pond, a waterfall, or other. Water have been built for thousands of years. It was natural that in the hot places of Egypt and Mesopotamia refreshing water gardens should be found. As early as 1225 BC, Ramses III built water lily ponds. 
The Inca of Peru built gold and silver water channels, pools, and basins as early as 2500 BC. Their homes and palaces had water running in channels under the floors to cool the surrounding air. Their courtyards had cooling pools for tired travelers.
The Chinese and Japanese imitated nature in their water gardens. The water garden was a sign of perfection and peace. By the third century AD they had written down the essentials of a water garden. In the 15th century, they turned the water garden into an art form that used the sound and motion of water. A reflecting pool expressed the union of heaven and earth. The Japanese built a dry garden, using small rocks, sand, and other materials to represent the course of a stream or river. Nature was recreated to serve as a source of thinking.
Europeans began using water for playing in the Middle Ages. Springs and wells were made focal points in gardens. Carp pools not only provided food, but a place for thinking and resting in monasteries. In Spain, the starkness of the Alhambra was softened with canals and pools.

The Gondoliers

The Gondoliers; or, The King of Barataria is an operetta in two acts by Gilbert and Sullivan. It is the twelfth of their fourteen operettas. It was first performed at the Savoy Theatre in London on 7 December 1889. It ran for 554 performances. It tells of two gondoliers. One appears to be the heir to the throne of Barataria, but which one? 
After completing "The Yeomen of the Guard", Sullivan wanted to leave light opera for more serious music. Gilbert reminded him that light, humorous operas were the source of their great success. Their manager Richard D'Oyly Carte promised Sullivan the opportunity to write a grand opera on the condition that he continue to write the light operas. Sullivan accepted. The grand opera would be "Ivanhoe".
Gilbert proposed a Venetian setting for the new light opera. Sullivan would have the chance to write bright, colorful music. Sullivan went to Venice to soak up the atmosphere. Once back in England, he received the lyrics to the new opera as Gilbert completed them. Sullivan however puttered at them. He was distracted with plans for the grand opera. He devoted the fall of 1889 however to "The Gondoliers". Sullivan labored at the light opera and completed it by December 2. The curtain went up on "The Gondoliers" on December 7 before a brilliant audience. The press raved.
"The Gondoliers" was an instant hit in London, chalking up 554 performances. It earned more money than any other Savoy opera in its original run. 20,000 copies of the published score were sold on publication, and over 70,000 copies of various arrangements were sold within a few days. 
D'Oyly Carte's "E" Company mounted the first provincial production on 19 February 1890 in Preston, Lancashire. From then on, it was never absent from the touring repertory until it was omitted from the final two seasons (September 1980–February 1982) before the closing of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.
Marco and Giuseppe are two gondoliers. One of them is believed to be the King of Barataria. But which one? It is decided that the two will jointly rule Barataria until the King's identity is brought to light. To complicate the story, a Princess has been promised in marriage to the King of Barataria. In the end, the two gondoliers marry their long time Venetian sweethearts. The Princess discovers her father's drummer boy is the long lost heir to the throne of Barataria. She is thrilled because she has always loved him. Everyone lives happily ever after.

Canary Current

The Canary Current is a wind-driven surface current that is part of the North Atlantic Gyre. This eastern boundary current branches south from the North Atlantic Current and flows southwest about as far as Senegal where it turns west and later joins the Atlantic North Equatorial Current. The current is named after the Canary Islands. The archipelago (group of islands) partially blocks the flow of the Canary Current (Gyory, 2007).
This wide and slow-moving current is thought to have been exploited in the early Phoenician navigation and settlement along the coast of western Morocco. The ancient Phoenicians not only exploited numerous fisheries within this current zone, but also established a factory at Iles Purpuraires off present day Essaouira for extracting a Tyrian purple dye from a marine gastropod murex species (Hogan, 2007).

Hall of Mirrors (Versailles)

The Hall of Mirrors in the palace of Versailles, France (French: Grande Galerie or Galerie des Glaces) was constructed on what was once a terrace designed by Le Vau. Mansart and Le Brun designed and built the Hall between 1678 and 1684. The Hall is decorated with marble. The "French order" capitals depict a cock, Apollo, and fleur-de-lys. The walls and cornices are decorated with gilded bronze trophies by Coysevox, Tubi, Le Gros, Clérion, and Flamen. The niches contain depictions of Bacchus, Urania, Modesty, Venus in Modesty and antiques from the collections of King Louis XIV.
The ceiling depicts the War with Holland (1672-1678). The medallions and trompe l'œil paintings depict the War of Devolution (1667-1668). They also depict the administrative reforms in the early years of Louis XIV's reign. Two of the four alabaster tables are from the collections of the duc d'Antin. The vases and busts are from the Royal collections. The 1770 chandeliers and candelabra were reconstructed in 1980 after the originals and documents in the archives.
During the 17th century, the Hall of Mirrors was used by Louis XIV when he walked from his private apartment to the chapel. At this time, courtiers assembled to watch the king and members of the royal family pass. In 1745 the Hall was the scene of "The Yew Tree Ball". It was at this event that Louis XV met Madame de Pompadour. In the 19th century, the Prussian king, William I, was declared German emperor on 18 January 1871 in the Hall of Mirrors by Bismarck and the victorious German princes and lords. French Prime Minister Clemenceau chose the Hall of Mirrors to sign the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I on 28 June 1919. The Hall of Mirrors still serves for state occasions such as receptions for visiting heads of state.

Campbell's dwarf hamster

Campbell's dwarf hamster ("Phodopus campbelli") is a species of hamster. It is native to central Asia. The species was named after a man called W. C. Campbell, who collected the first one in Mongolia on 1 July 1902. 
They typically eat corn, oats, peanuts, vegetables and a wide variety of seeds. They also eat insects, arthropods mollusks, leaves, wood, bark, seeds, stems, flowers, fruits, and grains.
The Campbell's dwarf hamster has predators like foxes, owls, eagles, kestrels, and falcons.
Campbell's dwarf hamsters live about 2.5 years to 3 years. They live in burrows and use grass, feathers, and wool, to create it. Seeds and food are extremely close inside because they don’t want other animals to find their food source so that they can have enough food when it is time for winter.
The Campbells Russian hamster is a grayish color with a cream white belly and a dark stripe running down its back. There are 3 types of colors that have been identified. The collared, mottled, and the spot. They each vary and can be very different from another.

<doc id="380160" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=380160" title="GNU Hurd">
GNU Hurd

GNU Hurd is a multiserver kernel with the goal of providing users with as much freedom to do as they wish with the GNU operating system as possible. It was initially intended to provide a free alternative to Unix (GNU stands for "GNU's Not Unix"). The Hurd was the intended implementation of the GNU operating system before Linux became the kernel of choice for GNU users. The current goal of the Hurd project is:
[T]o create a general-purpose kernel suitable for the GNU operating system, which is viable for everyday use, and gives users and programs as much control over their computing environment as possible.
The Hurd kernel consists of a microkernel that provides basic kernel services and a collection (or "herd") of servers / daemons that provided services that are beyond basic. This design was meant to provide developers with freedom that Unix and other Unix-like operating systems did not. For example, this design allows developers to program servers in languages other than the one used by the kernel. GNU Mach currently is the mircokernel being used in the Hurd.
Richard Stallman created the GNU project in 1983 and founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in 1985 in order to to fund and promote the development of free software and GNU. By the early 1990's, the GNU toolchain and other components besides the kernel were completed. Work began the Hurd in 1990. Stallmnan decided to use Carnegie Mellon University's Mach mircokernel as the basis for the Hurd microkernel.
In 1991, Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, and free software enthusiasts ported GNU's completed components to the Linux kernel in order to create GNU/Linux. NetBSD and FreeBSD were released a couple of years later, yet the Hurd was not in a functional state. Due to the presence of functioning alternatives, interest in the Hurd waned. As the FSF moved away from GNU development and more towards free software activism, Debian became more involved in the Hurd's development.

Ski resort

A ski resort is a place where people go skiing or to do other winter sports. Usually, these places are towns or villages in the mountains. This is because a lot of snow is needed for these sports. Ski lifts and slopes down the mountain are also needed. The lifts are usually cable cars, gondola lifts and chairlifts. Ski resorts also have hotels and restaurants for tourists. 
There are many ski resorts around the world. The Alps in Europe have a lot, and so do the United States and Canada. There are very few in Africa because it does not snow a lot there.

Charlecote Park is a house and park owned by the National Trust. It is located 4 miles east of Stratford-upon-Avon, and 6 miles south of Warwick on the B4086 Stratford/Banbury road. The house and park were owned by the Lucy family from the 13th century to 1945, when they were presented to the National Trust.
Sir Thomas Lucy tore down an earlier structure to make way for the present house in 1558. He was a man of wealth. He entertained Queen Elizabeth I at breakfast in 1572 as she made her way to Kenilworth. Lucy is better known for having fined the young William Shakespeare over a poaching incident in 1583. This incident prompted Shakespeare to flee Warwickshire for London.
Charlecote was inherited in the direct male line until George Lucy died in 1786. This man improved the house. He hired Capability Brown to improve the park about 1769. In the early years of the 19th century, another George Lucy continued improvements, leaving little unchanged except for the gatehouse.

Elimination reaction

In organic chemistry, an elimination reaction is when some atoms or group of atoms are taken away from a bigger molecule. Usually, a double or a triple bond are made by this reaction.
There are two main ways to do an elimination reaction. The first is called E1. It happens in two steps. If there is a good leaving group in the molecule, it can leave on its own. Then, a base or another substance can take away the other group. The second way is called E2. This happens only in one step. In this case, the base takes away one group while at the same time the leaving group goes away.
A common elimination reaction happens with alcohols. If there is strong acid around, a molecule of water can be eliminated to form the double bond.

Reaction mechanism

A reaction mechanism is writing step by step how a chemical reaction works. Usually, only the overall change can be seen in a reaction. The things made in between react too quickly to be seen. These are called intermediates, and in going from one intermediate to another a transition state is crossed. However, it is important to understand all the steps that make the total change. This is because then one can understand more difficult reactions or try to make a reaction work in a certain way.
There are many type of reaction mechanisms. In organic chemistry, the more common ones are nucleophilic substitution, elimination and addition. People sometimes use arrow pushing to draw how electrons move around during a reaction. This makes it easy to see which bonds are formed and which are broken during the process.

Fountain of Apollo

The Fountain of Apollo () is a fountain at the Palace of Versailles. It depicts the Greek sun god Apollo rising from the sea at daybreak in his four-horse chariot. He is accompanied by Tritons. In 1639, Louis XIII had a pond dug on the site of the fountain called the Pond of the Swans. In 1671, Louis XIV enlarged the pond. Le Brun suggested it be dedicated to Apollo based on its east-west orientation. The parallels drawn between Louis and the sun god also entered into the decision. Le Brun's Apollo is seen sitting in his four-horse chariot. He rises from the grotto of Thetys where he has spent the night. This theme was popular in the arts at the time. The gilded statue was made by Tuby of Rome. It was installed in 1671. Beyond the fountain lies the Grand Canal. The Fountain of Apollo incorrectly depicts Apollo rising in the west rather than the east.
In 2014, a same-scale replica was unveiled in Tainan, Taiwan, at the entrance of the Chimei Museum The museum gained official approval from French officials, and commissioned French artist Gills Perrault in 2008 to reproduce the Fountain of Apollo, same as the one in Palace of Versailles. It took three years for modern laser measuring and the mold to be made in France for the reproduction sculpture, and another three years to carve the marble in Italy.

Queen's apartment at Versailles

The Queen's apartment at Versailles (Fr: "Grand appartement de la reine") consists of several rooms: The Queen's Bedchamber; The Queen's Private Cabinets; The Room of the Queen's Gentlemen; The Queen's Antechamber; The Room of the Queen's Guard. The apartment overlooks the Parterre du Midi, and parallels the King's Apartment. When the King's Apartment was abandoned at the end of Louis XIV's reign, the Queens continued to occupy the Queen's Apartment. 
The royal couple ate in "The Queen's Antechamber". This was a public event. Louis XVI and Antoinette sat with their backs to the fireplace. Only the royal family could sit at the table. The duchesses, princesses, and others of great rank were allowed to sit on stools facing the royals. Others of high rank stood.
Louis XIV enjoyed the dinner ritual. Louis XV preferred more private suppers. Louis XVI ate well. Antoinette was bored. A witness reports that: "The Queen sat on the King’s left. They had their backs turned to the fireplace [...] The King ate with a good appetite, but the Queen did not remove her gloves and did not use her serviette (napkin), which was very wrong of her". To ease her boredom, the Queen asked for music at every meal. She had a platform set up for this purpose.
This room was once The Room of the Queen's Guard. In the 1680s, the room was sometimes used as a theatre. Royal virtues are illustrated in the ceiling paintings of ancient heroines by Vignon and Paillet. Portraits of Louis XVI's aunts by Madame Labille-Guiard are part of the decor. Above the doors are works by Madeline de Boulogne dated 1675.

Electoral college

An electoral college is a group of people who are chosen to elect a candidate to a particular office (job). The electors usually have one vote each. Often each elector represents a particular organization or entity. Many times, though, the electors are simply important people whose wisdom would ideally make a better choice than a larger group of people. The electoral college can ignore the wishes of a general membership.
A similar concept existed in the former Holy Roman Empire, in which the Holy Roman Emperor was elected by the rulers of various provinces of the Empire, or their representatives. These rulers were referred to as Electors. For instance, King George III of Great Britain was also Duke and prince-elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg ("Hanover") and later became King of Hanover, though he never visited Hanover.

Golden Triangle (UK universities)

The Golden Triangle is an unofficial name for a set of leading universities in the southern English cities of Oxford, Cambridge and London.
The University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge ('Oxbridge') form two corners of the triangle. The third is London: Imperial College, University College London, King's College London and the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). The last three are independent colleges of the University of London. The universities within the triangle (with the exception of the LSE) attract the highest research incomes of all British universities.
However, it has been argued that it should be replaced by a term like "Brilliant Diamond", to include the University of Manchester. The figures below suggest that both the universities of Manchester and Edinburgh belong in the same class. That might better reflect the geographical spectrum of the UK higher education.
Oxford, Cambridge and some of the London institutions collaborate in research. The Global Medical Excellence Cluster (GMEC) for biomedical research was formed by Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College, University College London, King's College London and Queen Mary University of London.

Lady Elizabeth Delmé and Her Children

Lady Elizabeth Delmé and Her Children (1779) is an oil on canvas portrait by Joshua Reynolds. It hangs in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC. The sitters in the picture are Lady Elizabeth Delmé and her children John and Isabella Elizabeth. They sat for their portraits in April and June 1777. Reynolds was paid three hundred pounds for the work in 1780, and touched up and re-varnished the picture in 1789.
Reynolds believed in the what was called the "Grand Manner". The two years involved in completing the portrait would have aged the children. "But Reynolds worked from abstract principles of design rather than observation of nature," the National Gallery of Art writes, "One of his conceptions for Grand Manner likenesses was: "Each person should have the expression which men of his rank generally exhibit." Reynolds therefore suppressed psychological individuality to gain a grandeur appropriate for these aristocrats."
Reynolds alluded to the Madonnas of Raphael (such as the "Madonna of the Goldfinch") in the triangular configuration of the sitters. This was another attempt to evoke the Grand Manner. Rembrandt and Titian are hinted at in the browns of the background. 
Cynthia Saltzman writes in "Old Masters, New Worlds" (2009) that "Lady Delmé has a long, elegant face, heavy-lidded eyes, and towering powdered hair. She wears a white dress and a cloak that covers her knees in a cascade of rose-colored satin that speaks both to her beauty and to the luxury at her command." Saltzman writes that "Lady Delmé" is one of the finest representatives of Reynolds's intent to raise portraiture to the level of history painting. English portraiture of the period "flattered the sitter", Saltzman explains, by depicting the sitter as a member of a powerful ruling class whose very existence made the world a better place.

St. Edward's Crown

St. Edward's Crown is a part of the coronation regalia. The crown was commissioned for the Coronation of Charles II on 23 April 1661 from the Crown Jeweller, Robert Viner. After the 1689 coronation of William III, its importance diminished. It was often carried in procession and set on the altar rather than placed on the Monarch's head. The Imperial State Crown was used instead for the actual crowning. It was not until George V's coronation in 1911 that the crown resumed its traditional place.
The present St Edward's Crown contains much of the crown made in 1661 for the coronation of King Charles II. The crown is made of gold. It weighs 71oz 14dwt. It was set with hired stones for the coronations and then reset with imitations for display purposes. In 1911 it was fitted with 444 semi-precious stones. The crown frame dates to 1661 but it is possible that it (or parts of it) were constructed from a pre-Restoration crown. Materials used include gold, silver, platinum, enamel, tourmalines, topazes, rubies, amethysts, sapphires, garnet, peridot, zircons, spinel, aquamarines, velvet, and ermine.
At a coronation, the Archbishop of Canterbury takes the crown from the altar and places it reverently upon the Monarch's head. "God save the King/Queen" is heard. The princes and princesses, the peers and peeresses put on their coronets and caps. The trumpets sound and a royal salute is fired at the Tower of London. After the crowning, the Monarch is enthroned and receives the homage of the clergy, princes, and peers.

Cry-Baby

Cry-Baby is a 1990 American romantic teen musical movie written and directed by John Waters. It stars Johnny Depp as 1950s teen rebel "Cry-Baby" Wade Walker, and also features a large ensemble cast that includes Amy Locane, Iggy Pop, Traci Lords, Ricki Lake, Kim McGuire, David Nelson, Susan Tyrrell, and Patty Hearst. The film did not achieve high audience numbers in its initial release, but has subsequently become a cult classic and spawned a Broadway musical of the same name which was nominated for four Tony Awards.
The movie is a parody of teen musicals (particularly "Grease") and centers on a group of delinquents that refer to themselves as "drapes" and their interaction with the rest of the town and its other subculture, the "squares", in 1954 Baltimore, Maryland. "Cry-Baby" Walker, a drape, and Allison, a square, create upheaval and turmoil in their little town of Baltimore by breaking the subculture taboos and falling in love. The film shows what the young couple have to overcome to be together and how their actions affect the rest of the town.
Part of the movie takes place at the now-closed Enchanted Forest amusement park in Ellicott City, Maryland. Others take place in the historic towns of Reisterstown, Jessup, Milford Mill and Sykesville, Maryland.
In 1954 Baltimore, Wade "Cry-Baby" Walker is the leader of a gang of "Drapes", which includes his teenage mom sister Pepper, facially disfigured Mona "Hatchet Face" Malnorowski, wild and free-spirited Wanda Woodward, and Milton Hackett, the nervous son of overzealous religious activists. His ability to shed a single tear drives all the girls wild. One day after school, he is approached by Allison Vernon-Williams, a pretty girl tired of being a "square", and the two fall in love. That same day, Cry-Baby approaches the "square" part of town to a talent show (""Sh-Boom", "A Teenage Prayer") at the recreation center where Allison's grandmother hosts events, and introduces himself to her, who is skeptical of his motives. Cry-Baby invites Allison to a party at Turkey Point, a local hangout spot for the drapes.
Despite her grandmother's skepticism, Allison accompanies Cry-Baby to Turkey Point and sings with the drapes ("King Cry-Baby""). As Cry-Baby and Allison tell each other about their orphan lives (Cry-Baby's father was sent to the electric chair after being the "Alphabet Bomber" - a killer who bombed places in alphabetical order airport, barber shop etc.; Allison's parents always took separate flights to avoid orphaning her if they crashed, but one day both their planes went down), Allison's jealous square boyfriend, Baldwin, starts a riot. Cry-Baby is blamed for the fight and sent to a penitentiary, outraging all his friends and even Allison's grandmother, who is impressed by Cry-Baby's posture, manners, and musical talent.
As Lenora Frigid, a girl with a crush on Cry-Baby but constantly rejected by him, claims to be pregnant with his child, Allison feels betrayed and returns to Baldwin and the squares, though her grandmother advises her against rushing into a decision. Meanwhile, in the penitentiary, Cry-Baby gets a teardrop tattoo. He tells the tattoo artist, fellow drape Dupree (Robert Tyree): "I've been hurt all my life, but real tears wash away. This one's for Allison, and I want it to last forever!".
Eventually, Allison is persuaded by the newly established alliance between the Drapes and her grandmother to stand by Cry-Baby and join the campaign for his release ("Please, Mr. Jailer"). Cry-Baby is released but immediately insulted by Baldwin who, after revealing that his grandfather is the one who electrocuted Cry-Baby's father, challenges him to a chicken race. Cry-Baby wins, as Baldwin chickens out, and is reunited with Allison.
The movie ends with all watching the chicken race crying a single tear, all except for Allison and Cry-Baby, who has finally let go of the past, enabling him to cry from both eyes.

Kashmir conflict

The Kashmir conflict (, ) is a dispute over the territory of Kashmir. The dispute is between India and Pakistan. India claims all of the region that was once a princely state. It currently controls about 43% of the territory, including most of Jammu, the Kashmir Valley, Ladakh, and the Siachen Glacier. India's claims are disputed by Pakistan, which controls about 37% of Kashmir, including Azad Kashmir and the northern areas of Gilgit and Baltistan. Pakistan says there should be a referendum in Kashmir on whether the people want to join India or Pakistan, or become independent.
The conflict started during the Partition of India (1947–48). On October 20, 1947, tribesmen backed by Pakistan invaded Kashmir. The Maharaja of Jammu & Kashmir initially fought back but on 27 October appealed for assistance to the Governor-General Louis Mountbatten, who agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India. Once the papers of accession to India were signed, Indian soldiers entered Kashmir with orders to stop any further occupation, but they were not allowed to expel anyone from the state. India took the matter to the United Nations. The UN resolution asked Pakistan to vacate the areas it has occupied and asked India to assist the U.N. Plebiscite Commission to organize a plebiscite to determine the will of the people. Pakistan refused to vacate the occupied areas.
In 1947-8 India and Pakistan fought their first war over Jammu and Kashmir. Under United Nations' supervision, they agreed to a ceasefire along a line which left one-third of the state - comprising what Pakistan calls Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and the Northern Areas administered by Pakistan and two-thirds, Jammu, Ladakh and the Kashmir Valley, controlled by India. In 1972, under the terms of the Simla agreement, the ceasefire line was renamed the Line of Control. 
Although India claims that the entire state is part of India, it has been prepared to accept the Line of Control as the international border, with some possible modifications. Both the US and the UK have also favoured turning the Line of Control into an internationally-recognised frontier. 
But Pakistan has consistently refused to accept the Line of Control as the border since the predominantly Muslim Kashmir Valley would remain as part of India. Formalising the status quo also does not take account of the aspirations of those Kashmiris who have been fighting since 1989 for independence for the whole or part of the state.
Another reason behind the dispute over Kashmir is water. Many rivers start in Kashmir. Some of them are tributaries of the Indus River basin, such as the Jhelum and Chenab River. These flow into Pakistan and are used for irrigation there. Other rivers like the Ravi, Beas River and the Sutlej flow into northern India.
One of the origins of the conflict is that with the Boundary Award of 1947, many of the Pakistani irrigation systems can be controlled from India. Pakistan has been afraid that India could stop the flow of rivers that start in Indian-controlled Kashmir and flow into Pakistan. This would harm the agrarian economy of Pakistan. The Indus Waters Treaty signed in 1960 resolved most of these disputes over the sharing of water.
Today Kashmir is split, as follows:
Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for more than 60 years. Currently a boundary - the Line of Control - divides the region in two, with one part military occupied by India and one administered by Pakistan. India would like to formalise this status quo and make it the accepted international boundary. But Pakistan and Kashmiri activists reject this plan because they both want greater control over the region.
As with other disputed territories, each government issues maps depicting their claims in Kashmir as part of their territory, regardless of actual control. It is illegal in India to exclude all or part of Kashmir in a map. It is also illegal in Pakistan not to include the state of Jammu and Kashmir as disputed territory, as permitted by the UN. Non-participants often use the Line of Control and the Line of Actual Control as the depicted boundaries, as is done in the CIA World Factbook, and the region is often marked out in hashmarks, although the Indian government strictly opposes such practices. When Microsoft released a map in Windows 95 and MapPoint 2002, a controversy was raised because it did not show all of Kashmir as part of India as per Indian claim. However, all the neutral and Pakistani companies claim to follow the UN's map and over 90% of all maps containing the territory of Kashmir show it as disputed territory.

The Mikado, or The Town of Titipu is a two-act operetta. The book and lyrics were written by W. S. Gilbert. The music was written by Arthur Sullivan. The operetta premiered 14 March 1885 at the Savoy Theatre, London, with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. 
"The Mikado" is the ninth of the fourteen Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. It had 672 performances in its original run. This was the longest original run of any Gilbert and Sullivan operetta.
At the time of the operetta's creation, London was overwhelmed with all things Japanese: tea shops, kimonos, fans, etc. Gilbert reported that he got the idea for "The Mikado" when a Japanese sword fell from the wall of his study.
Nanki Poo is the son of the Mikado. He has disguised himself as a wandering minstrel to be near the village girl he loves Yum Yum. Their love is complicated by an old woman named Katisha who believes she will marry Nanki Poo. In the end, Nanki Poo and Yum Yum are united. Katisha settles for Koko, the town's executioner.

<doc id="380553" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=380553" title="The Ballet of the Nuns">
The Ballet of the Nuns

The Ballet of the Nuns is the first "ballet blanc" and the first romantic ballet. It is an episode in Act III of Giacomo Meyerbeer's grand opera, "Robert le Diable". It premiered in November 1831 at the Paris Opéra. The choreography (now lost) was created by either Filippo Taglioni or Jean Coralli. 
The short ballet tells of deceased nuns rising from their tombs in a ruined cloister to seduce the knight, Robert le Diable. At the end of the ballet, the white-clad nuns return to their tombs. The ballet was created because officials at the Paris Opéra wanted to demonstrate the building's newly installed gas lighting. The lighting was capable of creating ghastly effects. 
"The Ballet of the Nuns" starred Marie Taglioni as the Abbess Helena. Although opening night was marred with a few mishaps, Taglioni made her indelible mark on the ballet world in the role. She became known for her ethereal qualities and her moral purity, and is one of the most celebrated ballerinas in history.
The ballet opens with Bertram, Robert le Diable's father, entering the ruined cloister of Sainte-Rosalie. He summons the ghosts of nuns who have violated their vows. They rise from their graves. He orders them to seduce his son Robert into accepting a deadly talisman. The Abbess Helena orders the ghosts to waltz. In spite of their sacred vows, the nuns waltz. The dead nuns give themselves over to unholy thrills.
Robert enters. The nuns hide, but return to prevent his escape. Robert stands terrified before a saint's tomb. The Abbess lures him towards the talisman in the saint's hand. Robert seizes it. The nuns continue their dance, fluttering like white moths. Their graves open and they sink into the earth. Stone slabs slide into place, covering the dead. A choir of demons is heard.
Ballet of the 18th century was based on rational thought and classical art. The French Revolution however ushered in a period that brought romantic ballet to the stage. Trapdoors, gas lighting, and other elements that became associated with the romantic ballet had been used in the popular theaters on the Paris boulevards for some time. Such elements would gain official sanction and prestige at the Paris Opéra in the middle decades of the 19th century.
A ballet on a "Robert le Diable" theme was danced in Paris before Her Highness Mlle de Longueville in 1652. "The Ballet of the Nuns" however was something entirely new in concept to audiences on the ballet's opening night. Henri Duponchel, managing director of the Paris Opéra, was in charge of visual effects at the Opéra. He wanted to demonstrate the venue's recently installed gas lighting. Its reflectors produced a stronger, more keenly directed light than ever before. Working with him was Pierre Ciceri, chief scenery designer. Ciceri was inspired by either the Saint-Trophime cloister in Arles or the cloister of Monfort-l'Amaury for the ballet's moonlit setting.
The theme of the ballet is passion and death, and love beyond the grave. The scene is night rather than day, and Gothic Europe rather than the classical world of Greece and Rome. After almost 100 years of rational thought, audiences were clamoring for the mysterious, the supernatural, the vague, and the doomed. The story of the ballet is about a knight who slips into a cloister at midnight to steal a talisman from a dead saint's hand that will allow him to win a princess.
Hans Christian Andersen included the scene in one of his novels. Andersen writes of the scene, "By the hundred they rise from the graveyard and drift into the cloister. They seem not to touch the earth. Like vaporous images, they glide past one another ... Suddenly their shrouds fall to the ground. They stand in all their voluptuous nakedness, and there begins a bacchanal." The nuns were not completely naked, but Andersen did capture the essence of the scene.
Opening night was spoiled by a falling gaslight and a trapdoor that would not close properly. A piece of scenery fell, narrowly missing Taglioni. The curtain was brought down. The ballerina assured everyone she was unharmed. The curtain rose and the performance continued. It ended in a triumph for Meyerbeer, the Taglionis, and Dr. Louis Véron, the Opéra's new manager. 
Dr. Véron had recently been awarded the Paris Opéra as a private enterprise. He had great faith in Taglioni. He raised her salary to an unprecedented 30,000 francs a year. Her father was named ballet master with a three year contract. Véron's boldness was rewarded when Taglioni fulfilled her promise and became a great star.
The audience took prurient delight in the scandalous "Nuns". A reviewer for the "Revue des Deux-Mondes" wrote:A crowd of mute shades glides though the arches. All these women cast off their nuns' costume, they shake off the cold powder of the grave; suddenly they throw themselves into the delights of their past life; they dance like bacchantes, they play like lords, they drink like sappers. What a pleasure to see these light women.
"Nuns" was the first "ballet blanc" and the first romantic ballet. The opera was performed 756 times between 1831 and 1893 at the Paris Opéra. French Impressionist Edgar Degas painted the ballet scene several times between 1871 and 1876. 
Under her contract, Taglioni was to appear in "Nuns" about a dozen times. She left after six. It is possible that the erotic implications of the nuns' ballet did not set well with her. She may have been reluctant to appear in a ballet within an opera. A foot injury and the accidents that marred the first performance may have given the ballerina pause for thought. Bad press directed at her father may have caused Taglioni to withdraw. Taglioni was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, who danced the role 232 times. 
The Danish choreographer August Bournonville saw Fitzjames's performance as the Abbess in Paris in 1841. He based his own choreography, which was used in Copenhagen between 1833 and 1863, on this. His choreography has been fully preserved. It represents the only record of the original.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's future wife Fanny Appleton wrote, "The diabolical music and the dead rising from their tombs and the terrible darkness and the strange dance unite to form a stage effect almost unrivaled. The famous witches' (nuns) dance in the freezing moonlight in the ruined abbey, was as impressive as expected ... They drop in like flakes of snow and are certainly very charming witches with their jaunty Parisian figures and most refined pirouettes." 
Critic and dance historian Andre Levinson writes, "The academic dance had been an agreeable exercise to watch. Now, [ballet] clarified matters of the soul. Ballet was a divertissement (an entertainment, a distraction). It became a mystery." Kisselgoff writes, "... the preoccupation with the supernatural that characterized so much of 19th-century ballet could be traced to the success of the "Ballet of the Nuns" in Meyerbeer's first production at the Paris Opéra".

Imperial State Crown

The Imperial State Crown is one of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom and symbolises the sovereignty of the monarch. The crown has existed in several versions since the 15th century. 
The modern version of the Imperial State Crown is of a design somewhat similar to that of St Edward's Crown, but shorter and encrusted with jewels: it includes a base of four crosses alternating with four fleurs-de-lis, above which are four half-arches surmounted by a cross. Inside is a purple velvet cap with an ermine border. The Imperial State Crown includes many precious gems, including 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, and 5 rubies.
The crown includes several famous jewels. The cross at the top is set with a stone known as St. Edward's Sapphire, a sapphire taken from the ring (or possibly coronet) of Edward the Confessor. The Black Prince's Ruby (actually a spinel) is set on the front cross pattée; the famous Cullinan II, or Lesser Star of Africa, is set on the front; and the back band contains the Stuart Sapphire. The crown also contains Queen Elizabeth’s Pearls.
When not in use, it is kept with the other Crown Jewels on display at the Jewel House in the Tower of London.

James (son of Alphaeus)

James (son of Alphaeus) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus. Levi is also called son of Alphaeus in the Gospel of Mark 2:14 so tradition has them as brothers but the New Testament does not state this, unlike the sons of Zebedee, Saint James and John.

Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom

The collective term Crown Jewels denotes the regalia and vestments worn by the sovereign of the United Kingdom during the coronation ceremony and at other state functions. The term refers to the following objects: the crowns, sceptres (with either the cross or the dove), orbs, swords, rings, spurs, the royal robe or pall, and several other objects connected with the ceremony.
Many of these descend directly from the pre-Reformation period and have a religious and sacral connotation.
After the death of James I, Charles I came to the throne. His many conflicts with parliament, stemmed from his belief in the divine right of kings. The many religious conflicts in his reign triggered the English Civil War. After six years of war, Charles was defeated and executed by the parliamentarians. Oliver Cromwell became the Lord Protector of England and, less than a week after the king's execution, the monarchy was abolished. The newly created English Republic found itself in a desperate financial state after the war. To raise funds the 'Act for the sale of the personal estate of the King,Queen and Prince' was put forward. Trustees were appointed to value the jewels and sell them to the highest bidder. The most valuable of these objects was the Tudor State Crown, valued at £1,100 (£1,740,000 as of 2011); it was set with 28 diamonds, 19 sapphires, 37 rubies and 168 pearls.
The present collection of Crown Jewels contains various crowns, some of which are used by every Sovereign, others being made personally for Sovereigns or for the Queen's Consort. Typically the crown of a King has a slightly pointed arched top, while that of a Queen has a slightly bowed top.
The Koh-i-Noor diamond was given to the East India Company by the former rulers of Punjab in 1849. It became part of the British Crown Jewels when Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India in 1877. It also contains the Lahore Diamond (22.48 carats) from the Treasury of Lahore given to Queen Victoria by the East India Company in 1851. and a 17-carat (3.4 g) diamond given to Queen Victoria by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire in 1856. The crown is now on display along with the other British Crown Jewels in the Tower of London.

Bird feet

Bird feet are adapted to the life they lead, and the patterns are often use in avian classification. They are derived from the basic limb of ancestral tetrapods, the pentadactyl limb. Whereas humans (and other primates) have the original five fingers and five toes, birds all have only four toes. These four toes are arranged into four main patterns.
The scales of birds are made of the same keratin as beaks, claws, and spurs. They are found on the toes and sometimes further up on the ankle. The scales and scutes of birds are thought to be homologous to those of reptiles and mammals.

<doc id="380600" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=380600" title="Addition reaction">
Addition reaction

In organic chemistry an addition reaction happens when two molecules come together to make a bigger one. This can only happen when one of the molecules already has a double or triple bond. These can be carbon-carbon bonds or even carbon-oxygen, carbon-nitrogen and others. One of the two molecules is called the nucleophile, and this is the one that gives the electrons to the other to make the new bond. The other molecule is called the electrophile, and this is the one that gets the electrons.
An addition reaction is the opposite of an elimination reaction. Common examples of addition reactions are the addition of water across a double bond and the nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl.

Electrophile

In chemistry, an electrophile is a molecule or an atom that is happy to take electrons from another one. Many electrophiles have a positive charge. They are also called Lewis acids. Some examples of electrophiles are molecules where the atoms have a big difference in electronegativity, like HCl or a carbonyl, or also oxidizing agents.
Electrophiles get attacked by a nucleophile, which is the opposite kind of molecule. This happens for example in addition reactions.

Henri Julien Rousseau (18441910) was a post-Impressionist painter. He was born at Laval, Mayenne. He worked a variety of jobs (saxophonist, toll collector) before beginning to paint at age 40. He was known as "Le Douanier" ("the customs officer").
From 1886 onwards, he exhibited at the "Salon des Indépendents". In 1905, he began exhibiting at the "Salon d'Automne". 
François Mathey wrote: "Rousseau is considered to be the greatest master of naïve painting, for his art combines a spontaneous vision of reality with an imaginary universe of great plastic and poetical power, in which he allied audacity with innocence, monumental composition with minute detail". 
Some critics ridiculed him for his style, but he came to be recognized as a self-taught genius. Rousseau's work had a great influence on many avant-garde artists.
He had an unhappy love affair in his last months. He died in Paris in 1910.

Chemical kinetics

Chemical kinetics, also called reaction kinetics, is studying how fast chemical reactions go. This includes studying how different conditions such as temperature, pressure or solvent used affect the speed of a reaction. Chemical kinetics can also be used to find out about reaction mechanisms and transition states.
The basic idea of chemical kinetics is called collision theory. This states that for a reaction to happen, the molecules must hit each other. Ways of increasing the speed of the reaction must therefore increase the number of hits. This can be done in many ways.
With experiments it is possible to calculate reaction rates from which you can get rate laws and rate constants. A rate law is a mathematical expression with which you can calculate the speed of a reaction given the concentration of the reagents.
the equilibrium is dynamic in nature
There are many types of rate laws, but the most common are:
From this data, it is possible to think about the mechanism of the reaction. If it is second-order, for example, then it is likely that both molecules in the reaction are coming together during the rate-determining step. This is the most difficult step in the mechanism to go through, because it has the highest activation energy.

The 300 Spartans

The 300 Spartans is a 1962 Cinemascope movie depicting the Battle of Thermopylae. It was shot in the village of Perachora in the Peloponnese. It stars Richard Egan as the Spartan king Leonidas I, Ralph Richardson as Themistocles of Athens, and David Farrar as Persian king Xerxes. Diane Baker as Ellas and Barry Coe as Phylon provide the romantic element. The movie is about a force of Greek warriors led by 300 Spartans which fights against an enormous Persian army. The Spartans will not flee or surrender, even if it means their deaths. When it was released in 1962, critics saw the movie as a commentary on the Cold War. It was impossible to shoot at Thermopylae. The sea had receded about 3 miles farther away from the narrow pass. Some 5,000 members of the Royal Hellenic Army were loaned by the King of Greece to portray both the Spartans and the Persians.

<doc id="380794" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=380794" title="Transition state">
Transition state

In a chemical reaction, the transition state is the point where there is a maximum value of energy. This energy is called the activation energy. When two or more molecules are mixed, they will hit each other. If they hit with enough energy to go through the transition state, they will react and form new molecules. At the transition state, new bonds are formed while the old ones are broken. In a graph or a drawing, the transition state is often marked with the double dagger ‡ symbol.
It is very difficult to study a transition state. This is because it is so high in energy that the molecules will stay in that form for a very short time, usually femtoseconds. It is important not to confuse transition states with intermediates. Intermediates are found at minimum points of energy, and they can live for a very long time. Like a transition state, however, an intermediate is between reagents and products of a reaction.
Studying transition states is very important to understand reaction mechanisms. There are theories and computer programs that can be used to calculate how the transition state looks like. This is a part of chemical kinetics.

Winged Victory of Samothrace

The Winged Victory of Samothrace (or Nike of Samothrace) is a Parian marble sculpture now in the Louvre, Paris, France. It is believed to have been made about 190 BC. It was discovered in 1863. It commemorates the Greek victory in a sea battle near Samothrace. It stands 5.57 m high. The work presents a pose where violent motion and sudden stillness meet. It is notable for its graceful balance and for the rendering of the figure's draped garments, depicted as if rippling in a strong sea breeze.

<doc id="380796" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=380796" title="Activation energy">
Activation energy

The activation energy of a chemical reaction is the minimum energy that is needed to make the reaction happen. It usually has the symbol E and it is measured in kilojoule per mole. It can be thought of as a barrier between the reagents and the products of a reaction. The activation energy is the difference in energy between the transition state and the starting reagents.
This equation is a way of calculating the activation energy. Its form is:
Here, "k" is the rate constant of the reaction (which can be measured using chemical kinetics), "A" is a frequency factor, "R" is the universal gas constant, "T" is the temperature. If we measure how fast the reaction goes at different temperatures, then we can make a graph and calculate the activation energy using this equation.
When using a catalyst the activation energy is made smaller. This means that the reaction can go faster at the same temperature. The catalyst does not change the energy of the reagents or the products. Also, the catalyst does not change in the reaction. Therefore, it can be used again and again and only a small amount of a catalyst is needed.

300 (graphic novel)

300 is a graphic novel written and drawn by Frank Miller and colored by Lynn Varley. It tells the story of the Spartans, the Persians, and the Battle of Thermopylae. The individual volumes were collected and reprinted in their entire by Dark Horse in 1999. "Publishers Weekly" wrote: "Form and content are ideally wedded: Miller's writing is stark, his drawings moody and dramatic, and intensified by Varley's grimly appropriate palette of earth and blood. The reader can see and feel the harshness of both the Grecian landscape and Sparta's battle-worshipping culture, as Miller presents the complex historical moment facing the 300." The novel was made into a movie.

Sacred Band of Thebes

The Sacred Band of Thebes was an elite fighting unit within the ancient Theban army of the 4th century BC. The earliest surviving record of the Sacred Band by name was made in 324 BC. The unit was comprised of 150 male lovers. It was believed these men would make better warriors. Plutarch (46–120 AD) is the source of the most substantial surviving account of the Sacred Band. In his "Life of Pelopidas" Plutarch wrote, "Since the lovers, ashamed to be base in sight of their beloved, and the beloved before their lovers, willingly rush into danger for the relief of one another." The band was reportedly organized by the Theban commander Gorgidas in 378 BC. Male couples were originally dispersed throughout the ranks of the army. It was later decided to create a separate squad. The squad played a crucial role in the Battle of Leuctra. It was completely destroyed by Philip II of Macedon in the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC.

Jerry Hopkins

Elisha Gerald "Jerry" Hopkins (born November 9, 1935) is an American journalist and author. He is best known for writing the first biographies of both Elvis Presley and Jim Morrison of The Doors, as well as serving for 20 years as a writer for "Rolling Stone" magazine. He also wrote several other biographies, wrote history and humor, and was a writer-producer for Mike Wallace, Steve Allen and Mort Sahl. He has published 36 books and an estimated one thousand magazine articles. The books have been translated into 16 languages and total sales exceed 6 million.
Hopkins was born on November 9, 1935 in Camden, New Jersey. He was raised in nearby Haddonfield, a town founded by Quakers. His parents operated a dry cleaning store. 
He attended a Quaker school through 6th grade and public schools through 12th. He earned a BA in journalism from Washington & Lee University in Lexington, Virginia (1957). For a short time, he worked as a reporter for the "Twin City Sentinel" in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He was in the US Army for a short time. After that, he earned an MS in journalism from Columbia University in New York (1959). 
After freelancing articles to the then-young "Village Voice" while at Columbia, he worked as a reporter for the "Times-Picayune" and as news editor of WWL Radio in New Orleans (1959-1961). He joined Mike Wallace as a writer-producer in New York for one year (1961-62) then moved to Los Angeles where he was a talent coordinator and writer-producer for Steve Allen (1962-1964). He also wrote and produced television programs for Mort Sahl, ABC-TV and Universal Studios (1964-1966; 1971). He wrote his first books during this period, an as-told-to autobiography of a health faddist, "Bare Feet and Good Things to Eat" (1965), and an astrological spoof, "You Were Born on a Rotten Day" (1969). 
In the mid-1960s, he left television to open the first “headshop” in Los Angeles. He then became the Los Angeles correspondent for "Rolling Stone" (1967-1969). He wrote features and columns for alternative newspapers, MC’ed the first love-ins in Los Angeles, edited a collection of material from the underground press, "The Hippie Papers" (1968) and wrote a history of rock and roll, "The Rock Story" (1970).
Leaving "Rolling Stone" temporarily in 1969 to write "Elvis: A Biography" (1971), it was while then serving as the magazine’s London correspondent (1972) he began researching his Morrison biography, "No One Here Gets Out Alive". It was rejected by more than 30 publishers before publication in 1980, when it topped the "New York Times" bestseller chart and was credited by many with helping kick-start the Doors’ revival as well as inspiring a new publishing genre, the rock biography. A sequel to the Elvis biography, "Elvis: The Final Years" (1981) followed, along with biographies of Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, Yoko Ono, and Raquel Welch, the latter of which was authorized but not published.
He moved to Honolulu, where he edited a monthly newsletter about Hawaiian music and dance and published several books taking Hawaiian culture as their subject, including "The Hula" (1981), a history; "How to Make Your Own Hawaiian Musical Instruments" (1988); "Elvis in Hawaii" (2002); and "Don Ho: My Life, My Music" (2007). He also was an editor at Pacific Business News in Honolulu and a speechwriter for Mayor Frank Fasi.
Moving to Thailand in 1993, he wrote for many travel, food and airline magazines. He worked with photographer Michael Freeman on "Strange Foods: An Epicurean Adventure Around the World" (1999), which was expanded and reissued as "Extreme Cuisine" with a foreword by Anthony Bourdain (2004). A collection of expatriate profiles, "Bangkok Babylon" (2005); a book of stories and essays, "Thailand Confidential" (2005); and "Asian Aphrodisiacs" (2006) followed. His 37th book, profiling Western novelists who helped forge the Asian myth, "Romancing the East", will be published in 2013.
Hopkins has been married four times, to Sara Cordell (1959-1963), Jane Hollingsworth (1968-1976), Rebecca Erickson Crockett (1980-1988) and has two grown children by his second wife, Erin Hendershot (b.1970) and Nick Hopkins (b. 1972), and six grandchildren. He and his wife, Lamyai (m. 2003), a citizen of Thailand, divide their time between a flat in Bangkok and a house and farm six hours away in rice country near the Cambodian border.

Greek shield

The "Greek shield" of Ancient Greece was called a hoplon or aspis. It was from this word that hoplite (a Greek soldier) is derived. 
A hoplon shield was a deeply-dished shield made of wood. Some shields had a thin sheet of bronze on the outer face. This was placed just around the rim. In some periods, the shield was decorated. At other times, it remained undecorated. These large shields were designed for a mass of hoplites to push forward into the opposing army, and it was their most essential equipment.
Probably the most famous decoration is the Spartan. This was a capital lambda (Λ). From the late 5th century BC onward, Athenian hoplites usually used the Little Owl (Athena's sacred bird). The shields of Theban hoplites were sometimes decorated with a sphinx, or the club of Herakles.

Breadfruit

Breadfruit is the name for an evergreen tree in the mulberry family. Originally, the tree grew in Southeast Asia. It has been cultivated and is grown in the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Central and South America and the Caribbean. The tree can reach a height of up to . The breadfruit is the fruit of this tree. The fruits contain a lot of starch - much like potatoes; they are ground to make flour, which can then be used for baking.
Ancestors of the Polynesians found the trees growing in the northwest New Guinea area around 3,500 years ago. They gave up the rice cultivation they had brought with them from Taiwan, and raised breadfruit instead. They took the trees with them wherever they went in the Pacific. The exceptions were Easter Island and New Zealand: both places were too cold to grow the trees. Their ancient eastern Indonesian cousins spread the plant west and north through insular and coastal Southeast Asia. In historical times, it has also been widely planted in tropical regions elsewhere.
The Mutiny on the Bounty was caused by breadfruit trees: In 1787, William Bligh was ordered to load a number of these trees on Tahiti and to ship them to the Caribbean; there they would serve as a cheap food for the slaves working on plantations. The main plantations at the time were those of sugarcane. This was the first attempt a government made to grow an economically important plant at a different location. The attempt failed, because the seamen did not understand why the drinking water supply was used to water the plants; they threw the plants overboard.
Bligh was able to ship the trees in a second voyage: Arriving in the Caribbean, he faced a different problem: The slaves there did not accept breadfruit as a replacement for cereals. Bligh won the Royal Society medal for his efforts, even though the introduction was not entirely successful. Although most slaves refused to eat the new food, breadfruit was accepted into the cuisine of Puerto Rico.

Hercules Room

The Hercules Room (sometimes Hercules Drawing Room or Hercules Salon; Fr: "salon d'Hercule") is a State Room in the Palace of Versailles. It occupies what was once the site of a chapel. Louis XIV wanted the Hercules Room to be a showcase for a large painting by Paolo Veronese. The architect Robert de Cotte began working on the room in 1710. Work was completed in 1736. The Room has been the scene of many glittering events in the history of Versailles.
The Hercules Room is a State Room in the Palace of Versailles, France. It is the last of the State Rooms constructed in the palace. The large room is on the ground floor (first floor) of the Palace. It measures 18m x 14m x 45m. A chapel once stood on the site. The Hercules Room connects the royal chapel and the North Wing of the palace with the Grand Apartment of the King. Architect Robert de Cotte started work on the room in 1710. The project was set aside in 1715 when Louis XIV died. Work resumed in 1724. Louis XV hired architect Jacques Gabriel, marble worker Claude-Félix Tarlé, and sculptors Jacques Verberckt and François-Antoine Vassé to complete the room. The room is in the style of the Hall of Mirrors. 
Louis XIV wanted this room to be a showcase for a large painting by Paolo Veronese called "Meal at the House of Simon the Pharisee". This picture was painted for the refectory (dining hall) of the Servite Convent in Venice in 1570. In 1664, the Doge gave it to Louis XIV. He wanted the king to support him in a war with the Turks. Veronese's "Eliezer and Rebecca" hangs above the fireplace on the wall opposite "Simon". 
"Simon" is a large painting. It measures 4.5 m x 9.7 m. The painting was once displayed in the Apollo Gallery of the Louvre. It was hung in the Hercules Room in 1730. It was removed in 1832. It was sent at that time back to the Louvre. In 1961 "Simon" was returned to the Hercules Room. In 1994 the painting was restored.
The room was completed in 1736 with a painted ceiling called "Apotheosis of Hercules". This was painted by François Lemoyne. The painting gave the room its name. The King was pleased with the ceiling. He appointed Lemoyne First Painter. Lemoyne however did not live long enough to enjoy the honor. He committed suicide shortly after the appointment. 
The coving is decorated with representations of the Four Princely Virtues: Justice, Fortitude, Constancy, and Courage. These are separated by Cupids pointing to the Labors of Hercules. In the center of the ceiling, Hercules arrives in his chariot on Mount Olympus. Jupiter offers his daughter Hebe in marriage to the hero. Mars and Vulcan observe the fall of demons and vices. Apollo sits on the steps of the Temple of Memory.
"Apotheosis" is the largest ceiling painted on canvas in Europe480 square meters of surface area. It depicts some 140 figures representing the gods and goddesses of Olympus. They have gathered for the arrival of Hercules after his successful labors raised him to the rank of God. The piece was seen as a metaphorical allusion to the merits of the French King.

Hill Top

Hill Top is a 17th-century Lakeland farm once in the possession of children's author Beatrix Potter. She bought the farm house as a retreat from London in 1896 at a time when she was making a significant amount of money from her stories. She used the farm as a place to develop her stories. Many of these stories (such as "Jemima Puddleduck" and "Tom Kitten") were set on the farm. Farm furniture, the ponds, and other elements were used as props in her books. 
Potter married William Heelis when she was 47. She moved across the road to Castle Cottage. She kept Hill Top though to house her collections of china, the "Two Bad Mice" doll house furniture, and other things. She continued to use the house as a retreat. She willed the houses and a large acreage to the National Trust in 1944. Hill Top is located near Sawrey in Cumbria. It is between Esthwaite Water and Windermere, 2 miles south-east of Hawksmoor.

The ball is notorious for being the venue in which the king made contact with Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson. He had first seen her while hunting at Senart. On 14 September 1745, Poisson was officially presented to the Court as the Marquise de Pompadour. She was the king’s official mistress until her death in 1764.

Clock Cabinet

The Clock Cabinet is a room at Versailles. It is one of the rooms in the king's private cabinets. An astronomical clock stands in the room. Louis XV took great interest in astronomy. The clock shows the time, the day of the week, the month, the year and the moon's quarter. In the crystal globe at the top, the planets can be seen moving around the sun according to Copernicus.
The clock was designed by Claude-Siméon Passemant, the King's engineer. It was made by the clock-maker Louis Dauthiau. The bronze casing was made by Jacques and Philippe II Caffiéri. The clock was used to determine the first official time system throughout the kingdom. The entire fixture measures over two meters tall.
The Academy of Science examined and approved the clock in August 1749. The Duc de Chaulnes presented it to Louis XV on 7 September 1750. It was put in the clock cabinet in 1754. The room actually got its name because of the large astronomical clock dials in the wainscoting. These clocks displayed the sunrises and moonrises every day. The king's scientific interests led him to upgrade that daily experience by having the Passemant clock installed in the room.
In 1692, the room was an Antechamber and part of Louis XIV's Art Cabinet. In 1738, it was remodeled into an oval-shaped drawing room. In 1760, it found its present form. The paneling is by Verberckt and Rousseau. The overdoors are copies of the Diana story originally painted by Boucher. The furniture in the room includes hunting tables ordered by Louis XV from Slodtz, Foliot, and Roumier. A Sèvres bisque equestrian statue depicting Frederic II stands in the room. Another equestrian statue in the room depicts Louis XV. It is a small copy by Vassé after Bouchardon's statue that stands in the Place de la Concorde.

Wholesale

Wholesale is the sale of large numbers of goods to retailers. The retailer then sells small amounts of the goods to individual users or consumers. A wholesaler often buys goods direct from the factory or the farm. The wholesaler can put together, sort or grade the products. The wholesaler will repack and redistribute the goods in smaller lots. Wholesalers usually have large individual warehouses to do this work. Food wholesalers often are located together at large markets.
Wholesalers used to be closer to where the retail goods were sold than they were to the factories or farms. Since internet sales have increased there are a number of wholesalers setting up near factories in China and Taiwan.
In banking, wholesale banking means services provided to large companies. Retail banking is services provided to small businesses or individuals.

Workhouse

The workhouse was a place which offered housing and work to people who did not have any. They began in England and Wales during the 17th century. The first use of the word "workhouse" was in a report by the mayor of Abingdon in 1631 on the building of a workhouse in the town.
The beginnings of the workhouse got back to the Poor Law Act of 1388. This was designed to help solve a shortage of workers after the Black Death. It made it difficult for them to move about the country, and stopped them from looking for higher paid work somewhere else. This led to the state being responsible for the welfare of the poor. After the Napoleonic Wars there was a lot of unemployment. There was also unemployment caused by machines taking over work from farm workers. In the 1830s there was also a series of bad harvests. These things put too much pressure on the existing ways of looking after poor people. 
New laws were passed, the New Poor Law of 1834, to try to deal with the problem. People would only be given help if they went into the workhouse to live. Some places hoped to make a profit from the workhouse by using the free labor of the people. Most did not have skills to get normal jobs, so workhouse jobs included breaking rocks into small stones, breaking bones to make fertilizer, or pulling apart old rope to reuse the fibre. This old rope known as oakum, was used to pack joints in ship building to keep them watertight. A metal spike was used to unpick the rope, and the nickname for the workhouse was the spike.
Life in a workhouse was not meant to be easy. It was made hard so only the very poor with no hope of finding work would go there for help. However the workhouse did provide free medical care and education for the children. This sort of help was not available to poor people outside the workhouse system.
Towards the end of the 1800s, the workhouses became filled with the old and sick, rather than unemployed poor people. In 1929 the laws were changed and the workhouses became hospitals. Some workhouses were renamed Public Assistance Institutions. These finally disappeared when the National Assistance act of 1948 was passed.

The Fifer

The Fifer or Young Flautist (1866) is an oil painting by French painter Édouard Manet. It hangs in the Musée d'Orsay, Paris, France.
Manet painted "The Fifer" after a trip to Spain he made in 1865. There he discovered the work of Diego Velázquez. Manet reflected the influence of Spanish painting in "The Fifer". The painting was rejected by the jury of the Paris Salon in 1866. The painting was exhibited in 1867. Manet died in 1883. In 1884, "The Fifer" was seen at the major retrospective exhibition of Manet's work organized as a tribute.
The rejection by the Salon jury caused the writer Émile Zola to publish a series of articles in defense of Manet in the newspaper "L'Événement".
Between 1873 and 1893, the painting was held by Jean-Baptiste Faure, a French composer and baritone, friend of Manet. In 1893, it was returned to the collection of art dealer Durand-Ruel. The painting was acquired in 1894 by Count Isaac de Camondo. It remained in his collection until 1911. That year it was donated to the French state. The painting was intended for the Musée du Louvre. It was not exhibited to the general public until 1914. 
In 1947, the painting was moved to the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume. This museum is a showroom located in the Jardin des Tuileries and belonging to the Louvre. It remained there until 1986. It then was brought to the Musée d'Orsay with the rest of the Impressionist paintings in the Louvre. It can currently be seen in the Musée d'Orsay.
Manet portrayed an anonymous character: a teenage musician of the band of the Imperial Guard. The lad was sent to Manet by commander Lejosne. He was "treated like a grandee of Spain." Additional models may have also posed for the figure. The likenesses of both Léon Leenhoff (Manet's stepson) and Victorine Meurent (Manet's preferred model) have been seen in the boy's face and figure.
Sandra Orienti declares, ""The Fifer" is one of Manet's most famous paintings, and it is also one of his most daring works: here ... can be found a synthesis of all that is most complex in his vocabulary." She points out that the band boy's uniform is painted in red, black, and white with decorations in dull gold. The figure and its dress contrasts with the vague, undefined background. The lad has no support for himself except himself. "[h]is form ... seems to create a double dimension, the first being the small figure of the boy, the second his eyes and the spectator's eyes meeting between the rather crudely painted eyelids."

The name Julie and its variants are feminine for the masculine name "Julius". Julie is very popular in the United States. The name was particularly popular between 1951 and 1991. Its variant, "Julia", has been in the top 100 female names dating back to 1980. Julie and its related names are being used by many famous people, such as Julie Andrews. As "Julia" the name is currently being used for Atlantic Basin tropical cyclones.

The Balcony

The Balcony is an 1868 oil painting by the French painter Édouard Manet. It was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1869. The painting depicts four figures. On the left is Berthe Morisot, who became in 1874 the wife of Manet's brother, Eugène. In the centre is the painter Jean Baptiste Antoine Guillemet. On the right is Fanny Claus, a violist. The fourth figure in the background is possibly Leon Leenhoff, Manet's stepson. It was sold by Gustave Caillebotte in 1884. It hangs at this time in Paris at the Musée d'Orsay.
The painting was inspired by "The Majas at the Balcony" by Francisco Goya. It was created at the same time and with the same purpose as "Luncheon in the studio". The three characters were all friends of Manet. They seem to be disconnected from each other. Berthe Morisot, on the left, looks like a romantic and inaccessible heroine, the young violinist Fanny Claus and the painter Antoine Guillemet seem to display indifference. The boy in the background is Manet's stepson, Léon. Just behind the railings, there are a hydrangea and a dog with a ball.
A study for "The Balcony", "The Portrait of Mademoiselle Claus", is in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. The portrait’s subject is Fanny Claus, the closest friend of Manet’s wife Suzanne Leenhoff. This unfinished portrait was painted as a study for the finished picture. 
Following Manet’s premature death in 1883, the portrait was bought in a studio sale by the artist John Singer Sargent. The portrait had only been seen once in public since it was first painted in 1868. In 2012 the Ashmolean Museum succeeded in raising the funds to acquire it and keep it permanently in a public collection in the United Kingdom.
This was the first time Berthe Morisot posed for Manet. Manet's "Luncheon in the studio" was the work of an innovator but "The Balcony" was not. Unlike Morisot, the three other figures are pale and undistinguished. Orienti writes, "Guillemet looks pompous and stupid, Jenny Clauss a stereotype, and the painting as a whole seems to suffer from the uneven distribution of the figures." The press considered the painting "discordant". The contrast of colors (the background completely black, the white faces and clothes, the blue tie of the man, and the green railings) contributes to create an atmosphere of "mystery".

Lord's Resistance Army

The Lord's Resistance Army is a paramilitary group, and a new religious movement. Joseph Kony founded it in 1987, in the north of Uganda, to fight against the government, headed by president Yoweri Museveni. The group operates in Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in South Sudan. It wants to establish an independent state which is governed by laws based on the Ten Commandments. There is an insurgency called Lord's Resistance Army insurgency, which was basically caused by the group. Uganda was able to evict the group, but it continues to terrorize the population in the other countries where it is active. In conjunction with the conflict, the group is also said to have committed several grave abuses of human rights.It has been accused of widespread human rights violations, including murder, abduction, mutilation, child-sex slavery and forcing children to participate in hostilities.
The group is led by Joseph Kony, who proclaims himself the spokesman of God and a spirit medium. Since 1987, Kony is believed to have recruited between 60,000 and 100,000 child soldiers and displaced around 2 million people throughout central Africa. The LRA is one of the foreign organizations designated as terrorist by the United States, and its leadership is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Venus Consoling Love or The Bath of Venus is a painting by François Boucher. It is signed and dated 1751. It measures 107 x 84.8 cm (42 1/8 x 33 3/8 in.) It hangs in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. The painting once belonged to Mme de Pompadour. Boucher was Pompadour's favorite artist. The painting may have been intended for her apartment at Versailles or for her chateau at Bellevue. 
She allegedly posed for the painting. It is more likely Venus was a product of Boucher's imagination. The technical dexterity evident in the painting is the principal charm of Rococo art.
"Boucher's success in communicating the charm and sensuality of the nude lies in his mastery of color and fluid brushstrokes ... The painting exemplifies the rococo love of asymmetric lines and sinuous curves, artfully arranged to seduce both the eye and the mind of the beholder."

Stentor is a genus of filter-feeding ciliates. They are usually horn-shaped, and reaching lengths of 2 millimeters, they are among the biggest known unicellular organisms.
They are a type of protist ciliate in the heterotrich class. The old-fashoned name for them was trumpet animalcules.
The body is horn-shaped, with a ring of prominent cilia around the anterior "bell" that sweeps in food and helps swimming. Some reach several millimeters in length, making them among the largest single celled organisms. As in many freshwater protozoans, Stentor has a contractile vacuole. Because the concentration of salt inside the cell and in the surrounding freshwater is different, Stentor must store water that enters it by osmosis and then discharge it from the vacuole. They can regenerate, and small fragments can grow into full organisms. Each cell has one (often elongated) macronucleus and several micronuclei. Having two types of nuclei is charcteristic of ciliates.

Euglenozoa

The Euglenozoa are a large phylum of flagellate protists. 
They are part of the wastebasket taxon known as the Protozoa, which contained many obviously different protists.
Euglenozoa include a variety of common free-living species, and some important parasites, of which a few infect humans. There are two main subgroups, the euglenids and kinetoplastids. Euglenozoa are unicellular, mostly around 1540 µm in size, although some euglenids get up to 500 µm long.
Most euglenozoa have two flagella, parallel to one another in an pocket-like structure. In some there is a cytostome or mouth, used to ingest bacteria or other small organisms. This is supported by a microtubule from the flagellar bases; two other tubules support the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the cell.
Some other euglenozoa feed through the absorption, and many euglenids possess chloroplasts and so obtain energy through photosynthesis. These chloroplasts are surrounded by three membranes and contain chlorophylls "A" and "C", along with other pigments, so are probably evolved from those of a captured green alga. Reproduction occurs exclusively through cell division. During mitosis, the nuclear membrane remains intact, and the spindle microtubules form inside of it.
The group is characterized by the ultrastructure of the flagella. In addition to the normal supporting microtubules, each contains a rod (called "paraxonemal"), which has a tubular structure in one flagellum and a latticed structure in the other.
The euglenozoa are generally accepted as monophyletic. They are related to Percolozoa; the two share mitochondria with disk-shaped compartments, which only occurs in a few other groups.
Both probably belong to a larger group of eukaryotes called the Excavata. This grouping, though, has been challenged.

Kinetoplastid

The kinetoplastids are a group of single-cell flagellate Eukaryotes. They include a number of parasites responsible for serious diseases in humans and other animals. There are also forms found in soil and aquatic environments. They are members of the phylum Euglenozoa. 
Their main distinguishing feature is the presence of a kinetoplast, a DNA-containing granule inside the single mitochondrion at the base of the cell's flagella (the basal body).
The kinetoplastids were first defined by Honigberg in 1961 as the flagellate order Kinetoplastida. They are traditionally divided into the biflagellate Bodonidae and uniflagellate Trypanosomatidae. 
The Trypanosomatidae includes several genera which are exclusively parasitic. "Trypanosoma brucei" causes Sleeping sickness; "Trypanosoma cruzi" causes Chagas disease, "Leishmania" causes leishmaniasis, "Crithidia" is parasitic on insects, and "Cryptobia" is an ectoparasite on the gills of fish.
"Bodo" is typical of the free-living Bodonids, and includes various species which feed on bacteria.

He was promoted several times. He never saw active service. He retired in 1795. He married Catherine Southwell in 1790. They had two children, George and Sophia (later, the Baroness de Clifford). He died in 1801. 
Coussmaker sat for Reynolds 21 times and his horse 8 times between February 9 and April 16. Reynolds was paid 205 pounds. Another 10 guineas paid for the frame. The portrait remained with Coussmaker and his descendants until 1884. It was then sold to William K. Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1920. Museum curators describe the picture as "an exceptionally fine work ... The composition is complex and the whole vigorously painted."

The Dancing Class

The Dancing Class is an oil painting by Edgar Degas painted about 1870. It was the first of his ballet pictures. It depicts a dance class at the Paris Opéra. When he painted this picture, Degas did not yet have privileges to go backstage at the Opéra. In the late 1870s, Degas said, "I have done [painted] so many of these dance examinations without having seen them that I am a little ashamed of it."
Joséphine Gaujelin (or Gozelin) is the dancer in the center of the picture. She waits for the starting note from the ballet master. The watering can (to wet down the rosin on the floor), the top hat as music holder, and the empty violin case are props that Degas would continue to use in his ballet pictures. Degas would re-use the poses in this picture many times.

Diastereomer

Diastereomers (also called diastereoisomers) are stereoisomers which are not enantiomers. They are molecules which have the same atoms and bonds but different stereochemistry in at least one, but not all, of their chiral centres. Diastereomers can have very different properties even though they look similar. This is different from enantiomers, that have exactly the same properties except when in a chiral environment like the human body.
Every chiral centre in a molecule has two possible ways of putting the groups in space. With only one chiral centre, there are two enantiomers. With two chiral centres, you can form 4 different isomers. When all chiral centres are changed at the same time, two pairs of enantiomers are formed. When only one chiral centre is changed at a time, sets of diastereoisomers are formed. With more chiral centres the possibilities are many more.
Diastereoisomers which are different at only one of more chiral centres are called epimers. For example, -Threose and -Erythrose (see picture) are diastereomers because they are different at only one of two chiral centres. Because of this they can also be called epimers.

Rate-determining step

In a chemical reaction the slowest step is called the rate-determining step. This is the step for which the transition state has the highest energy. It can be thought of as the most difficult step to go through. It is also the step that must be used to calculate the activation energy.
Knowing which step is rate-determining is very important when studying a reaction mechanism. This is because if this step is changed the reaction can go much faster. This can be done for example by using a different reagent or changing the temperature or pressure. Changing the conditions for any other step of the mechanism will not change the overall speed of the reaction at all.
In the rate equation, which is an equation to calculate the speed of the reaction from the concentration of molecules, usually the only step that is important is the rate-determining one.

Japanese Footbridge

Japanese Footbridge is an oil painting by Claude Monet. It was painted in 1899. It measures 81.3 x 101.6 cm (32 x 40 in.) It hangs in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In 1893 Monet moved to a house in rural Giverny. In 1893 and the years following, he turned a swampy area at Giverny into a water lily pool. It became a source of artistic inspiration. In 1899 Monet painted 12 works that centered on the garden and the Japanese Footbridge he constructed. The National Gallery of Art writes: "When Monet exhibited these paintings at Durand–Ruel's gallery in 1900, a number of critics mentioned his debt to Japanese art. More telling, the impenetrable green enclosure—heightened in the National Gallery painting by the placement of the top of the bridge's arch just below the painting's top edge—harkens back to the "hortus conclusus" (closed garden) of medieval images, while also evoking a dreamlike contemplative zone consonant with symbolist literature, especially poems such as "Le Nénuphar blanc" by Stéphane Mallarmé. Gustave Geffroy described this effect in his review of the exhibition (Le Journal, November 26, 1900), speaking of "this minuscule pool where some mysterious corollas blossom," and "a calm pool, immobile, rigid, and deep like a mirror, upon which white water lilies blossom forth, a pool surrounded by soft and hanging greenery which reflects itself in it."

Water Lilies

Water Lilies (or Nymphéas, ) is a series of about 250 oil paintings by French Impressionist Claude Monet. The paintings are of Monet's flower garden at Giverny. They were the main focus of Monet's work during the last thirty years of his life. Many of the works were painted while Monet suffered from cataracts. The paintings are on display in museums all over the world, including the Musée Marmottan Monet and the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Carnegie Museum of Art and the National Museum of Wales, among others.
As part of his extensive gardening plans at Giverny, Monet had a pond dug in his garden and planted with lilies in 1893. He painted the subject in 1899, and thereafter it dominated his art. He worked continuously for more than twenty years on a large-scale decorative series, attempting to capture every observation, impression, and reflection of the flowers and water. The series captures the blooms at different times of the day, and under different atmospheric conditions. After much hesitation, Monet exhibited a group of 48 water-lily paintings in 1909 at the Paris gallery of his art dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel. The series became an enormous financial, popular, and critical hit. By the mid-1910s, Monet had achieved a completely new, fluid, and somewhat audacious style of painting in which the water-lily pond became the point of departure for an almost abstract art.

The Attentive Nurse

The Attentive Nurse is an oil painting by Jean-Baptiste-Siméon-Chardin. It measures 46.2 x 37 cm (18 3/16 x 14 9/16 in.). It was painted in 1747. It hangs in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. 
The National Gallery tells us that Chardin reveals dignity and beauty in everyday life. The woman is preparing an invalid's meal. Each object receives careful treatment from the artist. The table setting is a harmony of white tones: jug, tablecloth, egg, and plate. Every pot, each piece of crockery has been given distinct treatment. As Diderot wrote of Chardin, "it is not white, red, or black pigment that you mix on your palette, it is the very substance of objects."
Chardin's subjects were popular with all classes of society, including the aristocracy. The National Gallery writes, "Perhaps their appeal rested in their sense of order, of things in their proper place. Chardin anticipated the popularity of paintings of "sensibility," which increased from the 1740s on, telling a colleague that "one uses color, but one paints with sentiment."

Broth

Broth is sometimes defined as the liquid part of soup. It can be made by boiling meat in water and taking out the fat. It is sometimes used as an ingredient in recipes to make food taste better.
In Britain, a broth is a soup in which there are solid pieces of meat or fish, with some vegetables. It is usually made with a stock or plain water as its base, with meat or fish added while being brought to a boil, and vegetables added later. Broth is often made more substantial by adding rice, barley or pulses. Broth is distinct from stock, which is a thin liquid made by simmering raw ingredients until all the taste has been retrieved from them, then sieving the resulting liquid.
In the United States terms, broths are made from portions of meat, whereas stocks are made from vegetable scraps and bones.

Samuel Loomis

Dr. Samuel James "Sam" Loomis (March 13, 1922 – c. October 29th, 1998) is an fictional British character in the "Halloween". He is the main good guy of "Halloween", "Halloween II", ', ' and "". Donald Pleasence plays the character of Dr. Loomis in all five movies relating to Michael Michael Myers from parts 1-2 and from parts 4-6 (He and Michael did not appear in part 3). 
From all the "Halloween franchise", he is thought to be as the archenemy to the series' central character and main villian, Michael Myers. In part six of the franchise, Dr. Loomis becomes the leader of an evil group which is why he does not appear in the other movies, but the main reason was that his portrayer Donald Pleasence died before part six was released. Malcolm McDowell plays Dr. Loomis in the 2007 re-make, "Halloween" and in its sequel "Halloween II".
His name Samuel Loomis is based on John Gavin's character name from Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 horror movie "Psycho".

Soap Bubbles is an oil painting on canvas by Jean-Baptiste-Simeon-Chardin. It was painted about 1733-1735. It measures 93 cm x 74.5 cm (36.61 in x 29.33 in.). It hangs in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. Chardin chose homely subjects that proved popular with all classes of French society. He painted several pictures of boys playing.
The National Gallery of Art writes, "For the 18th–century viewer, bubbles were a form of entertainment. But they also were a symbol of the transience of life. The subject was popular; Chardin made at least three and probably four versions of this painting." 
The National Gallery of Art continues: "Chardin has rigorously constructed his composition. The boys are framed by a rectangular stone window, the sharp rectangles offset by the hunched youth whose arms and head form a triangle. This triangular shape is echoed in the hat of the younger boy. The focus of the composition, however, is the circular, translucent bubble, which glistens against the warm brown tones of the canvas."

<doc id="381231" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=381231" title="Operation Entebbe">
Operation Entebbe

Operation Entebbe, also known as Operation Jonathan, was a hostage rescue mission. It took place in July 1976 in Entebbe, Uganda. An Air France airplane was hijacked on 27 June 1976. The terrorists wanted the release of prisoners held in Israel and four other countries. Many of the hostages were later released but about 100 Israelis and Jews were still held in. Israeli forces planned and held a rescue of the remaining 106 passengers on 4 July 1976. 102 of the passengers were rescued. Lt Col Yonatan Netanyahu, who led the mission, was the only rescuer to be killed. 
On 27 June 1976 Air France flight AF-139 was hijacked by four terrorists. One third of the passengers on the airplane were Jewish. Two of the hijackers were members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The other two were members of the Baader-Meinhof gang from Germany. The hijackers forced the plane to go to Entebbe. 
The plane landed at Entebbe at 3 AM on June 28th. Three more people joined the hijackers. At noon, the passengers were moved to an old terminal building. Idi Amin, dictator and President of Uganda went to the airport to meet with the hostages. He told them he was working to get them free. He said the military of Uganda was there to help keep them safe. The next day, the hijackers said that if 53 other terrorists were not released from prisons, they would start killing the hostages. Of these 53 people, 13 were in prisons in France, West Germany, Kenya, and Switzerland. The other 40 were in Israel. The hijackers said the prisoners had to be released by 2 PM on July 1. 
On June 29th, the Israel Defense Force (IDF) held a meeting to discussed a raid to free the hostages. There were 3 major problems with this. The first problem was that Uganda was 2000 miles away. The fact that the plane was owned by a French company was also an issue. The third main issue was the fact that only one third of the passengers were Jewish. And of these, not all of them were from Israel. 
It was learned the next day that Idi Amin was, in fact, not working to free the hostages. He was working to support the PFLP. This caused other problems for the rescue mission. They now had to worry about the Uganda military at the airport. A large number of the hostages were released on July 1st. The hijackers still held 106 passengers who were all Israeli or Jews. The hostages who were freed were flown to Paris and London. The government of Israel said that they would free the prisoners held in Israel. Because of this, the hijackers agreed to not start killing the hostages until July 4th. Lt Col Yonatan Netanyahu was put in charge of the Israeli mission to free the remaining hostage. Training began the next day for the mission. It was done using information they had gotten from the released passengers. An old home movie taken in Entebbe was used to show them more about the layout of the airport.
Soon after noon on July 3rd, four C-130's took off from Israel with the troops for the rescue mission. Their path to Entebbe was carefully selected to avoid being seen by Russian ships or Egyptian radar. At 11 PM the plane reached Entebbe. A black Mercedes and 2 Land Rover were used to lead troops to the airport. The vehicles were the same as those Amin was known to use. The Mercedes had Ugandan flags and all 35 commandos wore Ugandan uniforms. As they got near the building where the hostages were kept, two sentries went to stop them. Netanyahu told his vehicles to slow down. When the two sentries were in range, he had his troops shoot them with silenced weapons. One of the sentries was hit and killed. The other was not killed. When he tried to use his weapon, Israeli troops quickly killed him with AK-47s. This caused much noise and the hijackers knew something was now happening. The element of surprise was believed to be lost. The troops moved quickly to the building. The terrorist outside the building ran inside yelling "The Ugandans have gone nuts - they're shooting at us!" The element of surprise was still there. The terrorists did not realize it was Israeli troops attacking them. 
It took the Israelis about 10 minutes to clear the building. The entire raid lasted just 99 minutes. The Ugandan soldiers and all seven terrorists were killed. Of the 106 passengers, three were killed. 102 were rescued. One of the hostages was not found. Netanyahu had been shot in the chest and 10 other of the Israeli military were injured. Netanyahu was the only one to die. The Israelis also destroyed at least 8 Russian-built MIG fighters. This was a quarter of Uganda's air force.
The hostages were then flown to Nairobi, Kenya. While there, some of the injured were treated by Israeli doctors. At least two people were moved to a hospital there. The rescued hostages were then taken back to Israel. It was later learned that one woman, the missing hostage, had been removed from the airport for medical reasons. She was later killed by the Ugandans. Her body was not returned to Israel until 1979. 
While officially known as Operation Entebbe, it is more often referred to as Operation Jonathan, named after Yonatan Netanyahu.

<doc id="381255" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=381255" title="Dido and Aeneas">
Dido and Aeneas

Dido and Aeneas is a three-act English opera. The story and words were written by Nahum Tate. The music was written by Henry Purcell. The opera was probably written about 1684-1685. "Dido" is Purcell's only true opera. It was possibly modeled on John Blow's "Venus and Adonis". Blow's piece was written and staged about the same time. Marc-Antoine Charpentier's little French operas may also have served as models. French music was appreciated at the English court.
The opera was intended for performance at the court. The death of Charles II may have caused it to be postponed however. The first performance occurred in a Chelsea girls' school run by Josias Priest (the dancing master at court) in 1689. Tragedy and comedy are deftly combined in "Dido". The lovers' scenes are tense with emotion. The witches' scenes are filled with comical cackling and mischief-making.
The story of the opera is taken from Virgil's "Aeneid". It tells of the Trojan Aeneas' tragic love for Dido, the Queen of Carthage. The opera manuscript has been lost or destroyed. Research and performance rely on earliest printed copies. Some music is believed missing from these early copies. That music is composed afresh by modern composers in Purcell's style. Sometimes music Purcell composed about 1685 is inserted into the score to make up for the lack of the original music. "Dido and Aeneas" is Purcell's best known work.
The words and story (the libretto) of "Dido and Aeneas" were written by Nahum Tate. The music was written by Henry Purcell. The date for the opera's composition is usually given as 1689. This has been called into question. The work is closer to the music Purcell composed in 1684-1685. The true date of composition probably falls in the middle-1680s rather than 1689. In the middle of the decade, Josias Priest's Chelsea boarding school for young ladies performed John Blow's "Venus and Adonis". This little opera was possibly the model for Purcell's work.
The opera was probably intended for a performance at court. The death of Charles II in February 1685 may have been a reason to postpone the performance. There is no evidence that the opera was performed at court at this time. The opera was first performed in 1689 at Priest's Chelsea girls' school, rather than at court. The themes, the mythological subject, the plentiful dances, the pastoral setting, the formal concision are all indicative that it was intended for a noble audience rather than the common man. It is more likely these short forms of opera appealed to the English. They preferred song and spoken dialogue.
"Dido" may have been modeled on the little French operas of Marc-Antoine Charpentier. It may have been modeled on John Blow's "Venus and Adonis", too. "Venus" was composed and staged about the same time as "Dido". The action is carried forward in "Dido" by arioso passages. Choruses and dances are used to frame the various scenes. The intensity of emotion in the scenes for the lovers is contrasted with the grotesqueness of the witches' scenes. Comedy and tragedy are carefully balanced in "Dido". This balance reveals Purcell's sense of drama.
After 1705, the opera disappeared from the stage. Occasionally, there were concert performances. In 1895, the first staged version in modern times was performed by students of the Royal College of Music to mark the bicentenary of Purcell's death.
The story of the opera is taken from the "Aeneid" by the Roman poet Virgil. Virgil was trying to create a national epic for the Romans in the way Homer did with "The Iliad" and "The Odyssey" for the Greeks. Aeneas is the son of Venus and Anchises of Troy. He flees his home after it is sacked by the Greeks. Ahead of him lies a seven year journey to Italy. Fate has decreed he will found a new nation. Aeneas arrives in Carthage. Queen Dido is mourning her dead husband, a man to whom she swore eternal fidelity. She has fallen in love with Aeneas, and he with her.
The original manuscript does not exist. Research depends upon the earliest printed copies. Some pieces are believed missing. Sometimes music Purcell composed in the middle 1680s is put into the score to balance the loss. Sometimes the missing music is composed completely afresh in Purcell's style.
The opera's tragic outcome is hinted at almost at once in the accompaniment to the Queen's Act 1 aria. The modulation in the ground bass from C minor to G minor on the words "I languish till my grief is known" anticipates the key of Dido's lament in Act 3. Purcell uses a ground bass at other moments: Dido's two arias (Acts 1 and 2) and in the aria "Oft she visits" in Act 2. This aria references Actaeon's tragic death by his own hounds. The word "ground" suggests that which will cover Dido after her death.

The Amiga is often said to have been ahead of its time. Although the Amiga did not sell well and Commodore went bankrupt, the Amiga developed a fandom and niche amongst video and graphics enthusiasts and gamers.

Rate equation

The rate equation (or rate law) is an equation used to calculate the speed of a chemical reaction. For a general reaction , the rate equation is: 
Here, [A] and [B] are the concentrations of A and B. "x" and "y" depend on which step is rate-determining. If the reaction mechanism is a very simple one, where A and B hit each other and then go to products through one transition state, then "x"="a" and "y"="b". "k" is the rate constant of the reaction. This changes with temperature, pressure and other conditions. 
The rate equation is a differential equation. If it is integrated, then an equation which tells how the concentration of reagents and products changes with time is found.
In special cases, it is very easy to solve the equation and find "k". For example, in a first-order reaction the equation is:
Integrating gives:
So, a plot of formula_4 against time "t" gives a straight line with a slope of formula_5.
Sometimes, experiments can be made so that the reaction looks like a first-order one. If the concentration of one reagent is kept at the same high value then it can be thought of as a constant. The equation becomes formula_6 where k' is the pseudo-first order rate constant. Then the method above can be used to calculate k'.

Human resources is all the people working for a company or organization. Sometimes, human capital is used as well. This is because employees (the people that work) are a good thing for a business because they add value to it.
Examples are teachers, etc.
It is important that human resources in a company are the best possible, because it is the workers that can make the difference. There are many factors to think about when talking of human resources:
Human resources management is the group of people within a company that takes care of human resources. They make sure every employee is happy with what they are doing. They also do recruitment (finding new people for a job).

Recruitment

Recruitment is the process of finding new people to do a job. For a company or organization, it is important to choose the right people from the beginning. This is because human resources are often a very important part of a business.
Recruitment has many different steps. First, the company needs to advertise that it has a job available. People then send an application. This usually includes a curriculum vitae, which is a summary of what a person has done until now in their life. The best applicants are selected and they come for an interview. This might also include some further tests or exercises to do. The person chosen is then given an offer of a job. Finally, they can choose to take it or not.
There are many ways of doing recruitment. Some companies go to consultants, who know where and how to find the best people. Universities and schools often have a group of people that tells the students about getting a job. At other times, a company might really want a person that is very good at a job but works for another company. They can then ask directly to this person, maybe offering more money. Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn are also sometimes used by people looking for a job.

Schist

The schists are a group of metamorphic rocks which have lamellar (plate-like) minerals, such as micas, chlorite, talc, hornblende, graphite, and others. Quartz often occurs in drawn-out grains so that a form called quartz schist is produced. By definition, schist contains more than 50% platy and elongated minerals, often finely interleaved with quartz and feldspar. Schist often contains garnets.
The individual mineral grains in schist, drawn out into flaky scales by heat and pressure, can be seen by the naked eye. Schist is characteristically "foliated", (~leaf-like) meaning the mineral grains split off easily into flakes or slabs. The word "schist" is derived from the Greek word "σχίζειν schíxein" meaning "to split". This refers to the ease with which schists can be split along the plane in which the platy minerals lie.
Most schists have been derived from clays and muds which have passed through a series of metamorphic processes involving the production of shales, slates and phyllites as intermediate steps. Certain schists have been derived from fine-grained igneous rocks such as basalts and tuffs. Most schists are mica schists, but graphite and chlorite schists are also common. 
Schists are named after their mineral constituents, such as garnet schist, tourmaline schist, glaucophane schist, etc. 
Schists are frequently used as dimension stone. Dimension stone is stone that has been selected and cut to specific shapes or sizes.

Ghost in the Machine

The "Ghost in the Machine" is a metaphor in philosophy. The philosopher Gilbert Ryle called mind the "Ghost in the Machine", and the idea that it was separate from the brain was the mistaken "official doctrine".
Ryle was referring to René Descartes' mind-body dualism. In dualist systems like Descartes', mental activity carries on in parallel to physical action, but the means of interaction are unknown or speculative. Ryle thought this was absurd, and as a kind of error which he called a "category mistake". It is like saying something like "cars move by motive spirit".

Tollund Man

The Tollund Man is the name for a mummy which was found in Denmark, in the 1950s. The man lived in the 4th century BC, in what is known as the "Pre-Roman Iron Age". The head and face were so well-preserved that he was mistaken at the time of discovery for a recent murder victim. Twelve years before the discovery of Tollund Man, another bog body, Elling Woman was discovered in the same bog.
Below the body was a thin layer of moss. Scientists know that this moss was formed in Danish peat bogs in the early Iron Age, therefore, the body was suspected to have been placed in the bog more than 2,000 years ago during the early Iron Age. C radiocarbon dating was performed: It indicated that he died in approximately 375-210 BC. The acid in the peat, along with the lack of oxygen underneath the surface, had preserved the delicate soft tissues of his body.
Examinations and X-rays showed that the man's head was undamaged, and his heart, lungs and liver were well preserved. The Silkeborg Museum estimated that he must have been approximately 40 years old, and about tall, at the time of his death. This means he was relatively small, even for the time. It is likely that the body had shrunk in the bog.
On the first autopsy report in 1950, doctors concluded that Tollund Man died by hanging rather than strangulation. The rope left visible marks in the skin beneath his chin and at the sides of his neck. There was no mark, however, at the back of the neck where the knot of the noose would have been located. After a re-examination in 2002, forensic scientists found more evidence to support these findings. Although the cervical vertebrae were undamaged (as they often are in hanging victims), radiography showed that the tongue was distended—an indication of death by hanging.
The stomach and intestines were examined and tests carried out on their contents. The scientists discovered that the man's
last meal had been a kind of porridge made from vegetables and seeds, both cultivated and wild: barley, linseed, gold of pleasure ("Camelina sativa"), knotweed, bristlegrass, and chamomile.
There were no traces of meat in the man's digestive system, and from the stage of digestion it was apparent that the man had lived for 12 to 24 hours after this last meal. In other words, he may not have eaten for up to a day before his death. Although similar vegetable soups were not unusual for people of this time, two interesting things were noted:
Bog bodies dry up and decompose rapidly, when they are taken out of the bog. Because of the facial expression, and the general state of the head, the decision was taken to expose the body. At the time, the head was preserved using Polyethylene glycol, the only material available. This method did not permit to preserve the body; it dried up and decayed. Today, the head is attached to a copy of the body. Both feet and the right thumb were also in a good state of preservation when the body was found in the 1950s. For this reason, they were kept in formaldehyde for analysis later. In 1976, the Danish Police Force made a finger-print analysis, making Tollund Man's thumb print one of the oldest finger-prints on record. Tollund Man is exposed in the Silkeborg Museum.

Elmelindo Smith

Sergeant First Class Elmelindo Rodrigues Smith (July 27, 1935 – February 16, 1967) was born in Wahiawa, Hawaii. He was a United States Army soldier of Hispanic-Asian descent, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in the Vietnam War. Despite being severely wounded, Smith inspired his men to beat back an enemy assault.
Smith was an American of Hispanic/Asian-Pacific American descent (his Hispanic blood being precisely of Puerto Rican origin). He was born in the town of Wahiawā which is in the center of Oahu Island in the County of Honolulu. There he received his primary and secondary education. He joined the United States Army in 1953 and was stationed in various countries overseas, among them was Okinawa.
During his stay in Okinawa, he met a Hawaiian born WAC by the name of Jane and soon they were married. They established their home in a military post in Tacoma, Washington and had two daughters.
On July 23, 1966, Smith was sent to the Republic of Vietnam and served as Platoon Sergeant of the 1st Platoon, Company C, 2d Battalion, 8th Infantry of the 4th Infantry Division. The division performed combat operations in the western Central Highlands along the border between Cambodia and Vietnam. The division experienced heavy combat against North Vietnamese Army (NVA) regular forces in the mountains surrounding an area called Kontum.
On February 16, 1967, Sergeant Rodrigues Smith was leading his platoon in a reconnaissance patrol, when suddenly it came under attack. NVA forces attacked the patrol with machinegun, mortar and rocket fire. Despite the fact that he was wounded, he coordinated a counterattack by positioning his men and distributing ammunition. He was struck by a rocket, but continued to expose himself in order to direct his men's fire upon the approaching enemy. Even though he died from his wounds, his actions resulted in the defeat of the enemy.
For his actions, he was recommended for the Medal of Honor. The family received the medal from the hands of Secretary of the Army Stanley R. Resor because President Lyndon B. Johnson was ill at the time. However, after the ceremony, which was held at the White House, the family which included his widow Jane and two daughters, Kathleen 10 and Pamela 6, were taken to President Johnson's bedroom.

Division of Parramatta

The Division of Parramatta is an Australian Electoral Division in New South Wales. The division was created in 1900 for the first federal election in 1901. It is named for the locality of Parramatta. The name "Parramatta" is an Aboriginal word for "the place where the eels lie down". 
The division is in the western suburbs of Sydney. It includes Constitution Hill, Dundas Valley, Granville, Harris Park, Holroyd, Mays Hill, North Parramatta, Oatlands, Old Toongabbie, Parramatta, Rosehill, Rydalmere, Telopea, Wentworthville, Westmead and parts of Dundas, Ermington, Guildford, Merrylands, Merrylands West, Northmead, North Rocks, Pendle Hill, South Granville and South Wentworthville.
The division lies between Labor voting areas of western Sydney and the Liberal areas on the North Shore. Because of this, any change to the boundary can change the political balance in the seat. For example, in the 2006 boundary change, Parramatta shifted from marginally Labor to marginally Liberal (as defined by the Australian Electoral Commission). Nevertheless, as was expected Julie Owens held the seat for the ALP with an increased majority.
From 1901 to 1921 the Division was represented by Sir Joseph Cook who was the Prime Minister of Australia from 1913-14. There have been several by-elections for Parramatta when the members have resigned. In 1921 Cook resigned to became Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, in 1958 Beale resigned to become Australian Ambassador to the United States, in 1964 Barwick resigned to become Chief Justice of the High Court, Bowen resigned in 1973 to become a judge in the NSW Court of Appeal.

Humboldt-University of Berlin

The Humboldt-University of Berlin () is Berlin's first university. It was founded by Wilhelm von Humboldt. He was the German Minister of Education at the time. Von Humboldt organized Germany's system of education which is still used today. The first building was donated by Frederick William III of Prussia. The University opened its doors in 1810 as the University of Berlin. 
At the time of its founding in 1810, there was pressure to make the new university both practical and industrial. Von Humboldt wanted it to be a center for the pursuit of truth in learning. In the end he won out. The University was set up under his principles. In 1828 it was formally renamed the Frederick-William University. The university was named in honor of the reigning monarch, Frederick William III of Prussia. The university offered the traditional faculties of law, medicine, theology and philosophy. Emperor William made several establishments at the University. One of these was the professorship of "American History". It is now called the "Theodore Roosevelt professorship". It required the position be filled by an American professor who must lecture in German. In an interview with then president Butler of Columbia University, a second professorship in Berlin was established with a lectures in English taught by a German professor.
From 1933 to 1945, under Nazism, the university lost many of its Jewish scholars and students. Some were killed. On May 10, 1933 many university books were burned. Before World War II Humboldt was still the major university in Berlin. After the war the university was greatly weakened. It reopened in January 1946. It was in the Soviet sector of Berlin. Many students and faculty wanted to continue their education free of communist government control. With the help of the US Army and donations from the United States government, the Free University of Berlin was established in 1948 in West Berlin. 
In 1949 the university was given it's present name, Humboldt-University of Berlin (), to honor the brothers Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt. The university underwent a number of changes by the government of East Berlin in the 1950s. But it regained its importance as a major center of learning.
The university got its start reflecting the principles of the great educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt. It pioneered many new academic disciplines. In spite of its problems in the 20th century, the university has returned to its founding principles. There are 260 degree courses offered. The university has an academic staff of about 2,170 and 35,000 students. it is currently ranked 80th among the world's universities. It has been informally called "Berlin University" throughout its history. Also, informally, the "University of Linden" () after its location.

2052 - A Global Forecast for the Next Forty Years

2252 - A Global Forecast for the Next Forty Years is a description of trends in global development of Jørgen Randers, that is a follow-up of "The Limits to Growth" which in 1972 was the first known worldwide report to the Club of Rome.
There are three differences to the previous report. First, it does not describe a disaster scenario, but shows only trends. Secondly, it is to be read in the light of experience since 1972, namely, that all of humanity has responded to the report, but with a delay of 20 to 40 years. Thirdly, it offers not only future scenarios, it makes concrete proposals on how the individual should respond to emerging developments.
Randers's reflections are based on two central questions: "What will happen to the consumer over the next 40 years?" and "Under what conditions - in which social and natural environment - this future consumption will take place?" (P.78) He uses computer models to make sure feedback effects are not overlooked.
The population will decline from about the 2040th.
The working population will peak around 2030.
Productivity will grow, but there will be obstacles.
The gross domestic product will grow, but more slowly.
Investments - forced and voluntary - will increase.
There will be new costs.
Costs for adaptation to the new climate and for repair of disasters will explode.
The state will become more involved.
Consumption will stagnate and decline in some places.
The energy efficiency will continue to increase. Energy demand is expected to rise, but not indefinitely. CO emissions from energy consumption will peak in 2030. The temperature will rise by more than two degrees, and that will cause serious problems.
The race for natural resources will be hard, the biocapacity of the world will be used more and more. The cities become richer sources of raw materials for metal than the mineral deposits in nature (urban mining). In the same way that zoos have already become the last refuge for many endangered species, parks will take over this role for nature in general.
Randers argues the global gross domestic product will fail to increase as it has in the past because of population decline, and general aging and declining productivity growth.
The Internet will give rise to a completely new understanding of private and public. Knowledge will not be a scarce resource any more, but that wont lead to more rational decisions in most of the cases, because the knowledge on its own is not sufficient to change behavior when strong interests are involved. Therefore, probably there will be needed a "green team" to enforce environmental behavior, like today, the peacekeeping forces (blue berets).

Alkyne

An alkyne is a molecule that has a triple bond between two carbon atoms. They have general formula CH. They are also called acetylenes. The smallest alkyne is acetylene, also called ethyne. Alkynes are hydrophobic: this means they dissolve well in organic solvents but not in water. 
Alkynes are more reactive than usual hydrocarbons. For example, they are more reactive than alkenes in many reactions. If the alkyne is at the end of a molecule, it is easy to remove the proton with a strong base. Then, the alkyne can be used in addition reactions. For example, it can be added to a ketone. Alkynes are also easy to reduce to double bonds. They can be made into both "trans" and "cis" double bonds. Alkynes are also used a lot in pericyclic reactions.
Alkynes have a 180 degrees angle between the two carbon atoms. For this reason, they do not like to be in a cyclic compound. Some examples of alkynes are shown below.

Carboxylic acid

A carboxylic acid is any molecule that has a COOH group. This group contains a carbonyl (C=O double bond) together with an hydroxyl group (OH) on the same carbon atom. Because it is easy to remove the proton with even a weak base, these compounds are called acids. An example of a carboxylic acid is Acetic acid, which is also known as vinegar.
Carboxylic acids are found a lot in food. Many types of fat molecules are actually carboxylic acids. For example, chocolate and coconuts have these acids. They are also used a lot in soaps and detergents.
The smaller carboxylic acids dissolve in water. The bigger ones dissolve only in organic solvents.

Epoxide

In organic chemistry, an epoxide is a molecule that has a ring with at least three atoms in total, two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom. These three atoms are bonded, or stuck together, in a small ring. The ring of atoms is shaped like a triangle, with all edges of the same length. Because of this small ring, an epoxide is very reactive. 
Epoxides can be made by oxidation of alkenes. There are many ways to do this. Usually, a peroxide is used. Some ways can even make only one enantiomer of the epoxide.
Epoxides like to react with nucleophiles. Usually, when an epoxide reacts with a nucleophile, the first thing it does is break one of its chemical bonds between the oxygen atom and the carbon atom. This makes the triangular ring pop open. With the ring open, the nucleophile gets stuck onto one of the carbon atoms. On the other carbon, the left over oxygen attaches to a hydrogen atom, turning into an alcohol. This is very useful, because it is easy to change an alcohol into many other functional groups.
Epoxides are useful because with them very complicated molecules can be made quickly. Epoxides are extremely useful for making many other compounds. That is because oxygen, which is in an epoxide, is such a great functional group. Once you have made an epoxide, you can make alcohols, ethers, and halohydrins, among other things.

The 10th Ward is a division of the city of New Orleans, Louisiana. The 10th Ward is one of the 17 Wards of New Orleans.
The 10th Ward is one of the city's Uptown wards, formerly the old Faubourg Lafayette annexed by New Orleans in 1850s.
The roughly wedge-shaped Ward stretches back from the Mississippi River. The lower boundary is Felicity Street, across which is the 1st Ward, then Martin Luther King Boulevard (formerly Melpomene Street), across which is the 2nd Ward. The upper boundary is First Street, across which lies the 11th Ward. 
Near the river the Ward includes part of the Lower Garden District and the former location of America's first experiment with large-scale public housing, started here in 1937, when, as part of the New Deal, President Roosevelt signed the loan to commence construction of the St. Thomas Housing Project. In Central City it includes the Oretha Castle Haley commercial district. 
The 10th Ward has been home to such notables as jazz musicians Buddy Bolden and George Brunies.
