Chinese cobra

The Chinese cobra ("Naja atra"), also called Taiwan cobra, is a species of cobra in the Elapidae family, found mostly in southern China and a couple of neighboring nations and islands. It is one of the most prevalent venomous snakes in Taiwan, which has caused snakebite incidents to humans.
"Naja atra" was first described by Danish physician, zoologist, and botanist Theodore Edward Cantor in 1842. The generic name "naja" is a Latinisation of the Sanskrit word () meaning "cobra". The specific epithet "atra" comes from the Latin term ater, which means "dark", "black", or "gloomy".
In Mandarin Chinese, the snake is known as "Zhōnghuá yǎnjìngshé" (中華眼鏡蛇, lit. "Chinese spectacled snake", i.e. Chinese cobra), "Zhōushān yǎnjìngshé" (舟山眼鏡蛇, lit. "Zhoushan spectacled snake", i.e. Zhoushan cobra) or, in Guangdong and Hong Kong, "fànchǎntóu" (飯鏟頭, lit. "rice paddle head"). "Spectacled snake" refers to the markings which the snake may at times have on the back of the hood that resemble eyeglasses. In Taiwanese, the snake is known as "pn̄g-sî-chhèng" (飯匙倩/銃, lit. "rice paddle ?"), "ba̍k-kiàⁿ-chôa" (目鏡蛇, lit. "spectacled snake", i.e. cobra), or "tn̂g-ām-chôa" (長頷蛇, lit. "long-chinned snake").
"Naja atra" is iridescent black with a number of distant transversal double lines of a yellow colour. The abdominal surface is pearl or slaty coloured.
This medium-sized snake is usually long, but they can grow to a maximum length of though this is rare. The dorsal color of the Chinese cobra is usually brown, grey or black, with or without narrow, light transverse lines at irregular intervals which are especially prominent in juveniles. The head on this species is broad, slightly triangular in shape and is slightly distinct from the neck. The dorsal scales are smooth and glossy, while the dorsolateral scales are strongly oblique. This is a heavy bodied snake, the body is slightly flattened, and may be significantly flattened when threatened, and it has a short tail. The nostrils of this species are large and prominent. The eyes are medium-sized and the iris is a dark dirty yellow dappled with gray-black or blue-black and the pupil is round and jet black. Like other elapids, this is a proteroglyphous snake with fangs that are permanently erect and are located at the anterior of the upper jaw. The upper head is usually the same color as the tail and dorsal part of the body, while the sides of the head are lighter in colour. Specimens with other colors on their dorsal surface, such as white, yellow or brown do occur. There may be irregular or scattered crosslines of white to light gray along the upper body and a spectacle marking on the hood, however, the hood markings may vary from partial figures to asymmetrical patterns. The ventral head and neck are white to light gray or light orange in colour. The ventral face of the hood may have a pair of small dark spots followed by a dark transverse band.
There is some variation in the colour of the ventral body and tail: it may be white to gray, dark gray mottled with white, or blackish. The populations in different geographic regions of Taiwan reveal a unique composition of ventral colouration: the eastern population is exclusively blackish (100%), the central and southern populations are mainly white to gray (both 80%), and the proportions of blackish and white-gray morphs in the northern population are 60% and 30%, respectively.
This species is found in southeastern China (including the provinces of Sichuan, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and the Island province of Hainan), Hong Kong, northern Laos, northern Vietnam, and Taiwan, where it is much more common in the south. 
Its typical habitat is woodlands, shrublands, grasslands, and mangroves. This species is adaptable to a wide range of terrain including grassland plains, jungle, open fields and even heavily populated regions. As an adaptable species, it occurs in a wide variety of habitats across its range. It can be found in rice paddy fields in maritime lowlands to various types of montaine forests, though it avoids dark forest with closed canopy. In primary monsoon season and rain forests, "Naja atra" inhabits clearings and riverbanks. Higher population density is observed in the vicinity of human settlements, in secondary forests, and in rice paddy fields which are adjacent to forests. The species can be found anywhere from sea level all the way up to elevations of more than above sea level. It usually hides under leaves, sticks, and rocks.
The Chinese cobra is a very alert, seldom cornered, but if confronted will raise its forebody and spread its hood and strike readily if necessary. Adults can be very aggressive, but the younger tend to be more aggressive. The Chinese cobra usually escapes to avoid confrontation with humans, but strikes readily if provoked. The snake is terrestrial, diurnal and crepuscular which means it is active by day and twilight. This species has been observed hunting during all daylight periods and as late as 2–3 hours after sunset from March to October, with ambient temperatures of 20–32°C (68–90°F).
The Chinese Cobra has a widely varied diet and it mainly preys on rodents such as mice and rats, frogs, toads and even other snakes. It is active during both the day and night. The diet of this snake is highly variable. It preys on any vertebrates from fish to mammals. Juveniles eat mosly amphibians, whereas adults usually prefer reptiles and mammals - during amphibian breeding periods, however, adult cobras eat mostly frogs or toads: the Cricket frog ("Fejervarya limnocharis"), the Common tree frog ("Polypedates leucomystax"), and the Asian common toad ("Duttaphrynus melanostictus").
It is oviparous. Mating and egg-laying periods are very extended. The species has been observed mating in the mountains of the western Tonkin region, at elevations of in the months of March through May. As recorded, gravid females will lay between 6 and 23 eggs sometime between May through to the end of July. 
The Chinese cobra is a highly venomous member of the true cobras (genus "Naja"). Its venom consists mainly of postsynaptic neurotoxins and cardiotoxins. Four cardiotoxin-analogues I, II, III, and IV, account for about 54% of the dry weight of the crude venom and have cytotoxic properties. The LD values of its venom in mice are 0.29 mg/kg IV, and a range of 0.53 mg/kg - 0.67 mg/kg SC. The average venom yield from a snake of this species kept at a snake farm was about 250.8 mg (80 mg dry weight). Although this is not a spitting cobra, some rare individuals (mostly specimens from Guizhou Province) are capable of ejecting venom towards a threat within a distance of .
Local symptoms in victims caused by Chinese cobra are wound darkening, localized redness and swelling, pain, insensibility, and invariably blisters and necrosis. Necrosis is a serious problem in cases of cobra bite as it may persist for many years after the general recovery of the victim. The following systemic symptoms may also occur: chest discomfort, fever, sore throat, difficulty in swallowing, loss of voice, weak feeling in limbs, walking haltingly, general ache, lockjaw, and difficulty in breathing. Fatality occasionally occurs. The antivenom is widely available and deaths are much rarer than they used to be.

Robots exclusion standard

The robots exclusion standard (also called the robots exclusion protocol or robots.txt protocol) is a way of telling Web crawlers and other Web robots which parts of a Web site they can see.
To give robots instructions about which pages of a Web site they can access, site owners put a text file called robots.txt in the main directory of their Web site, e.g. http://www.example.com/robots.txt. This text file tells robots which parts of the site they can and cannot access. However, robots can ignore robots.txt files, especially malicious (bad) robots. If the robots.txt file does not exist, Web robots assume that they can see all parts of the site.

VHF omnidirectional range

VOR, short for VHF omnidirectional radio range, is a type of radio navigation system for aircraft, enabling them to find their position and stay on course by receiving radio signals emitted by a network of radio beacons. It uses frequencies in very high frequency (VHF) from 108 to 117.95 MHz. Developed in the USA in 1937, VOR is the standard air navigational system in the world, used by both commercial and general aviation. There are about 3000 VOR stations around the world. 
A VOR station broadcasts a VHF radio signal including the identifier, voice, and navigation signal. The identifier is in Morse Code. The voice will have information from the station. The navigation signal allows the equipment to find a magnetic bearing from the station to the aircraft. VOR stations in areas of magnetic unreliability are oriented to True North. A line of position is called the "radial" from the VOR. The corssing of two radials from different VOR stations provides the position of the aircraft. VOR signals have a range of about 200 miles.

The Conqueror Worm

"The Conqueror Worm" is a poem by Edgar Allan Poe. It is about human mortality and the fact that death cannot be stopped. It was first published in "Graham's Magazine" in 1843. It was incorporated into Poe's short story "Ligeia" in 1845. In the revised story, the poem is composed by Ligeia. She teaches it to the narrator during her death throes.
Weeping angels watch a play performed by "mimes, in the form of God on high", and controlled by vast formless shapes looming behind the scenes. The mimes chase a "Phantom" which they can never capture. Finally, a monstrous "crawling shape" emerges, and eats the mimes. The final curtain comes down, "a funeral pall," signaling an end to the "tragedy, 'Man'" whose only hero is "The Conqueror Worm".
Though Poe was referring to an ancient connection between worms and death, he may have been inspired by "The Proud Ladye", a poem by Spencer Wallis Cone which was reviewed in an 1840 issue of "Burton's Gentleman's Magazine". That poem contained the lines "Let him meet the conqueror worm / With his good sword by his side".
The poem plays an important symbolic role as part "Ligeia." The poem is written by Ligeia as she is dying, though it is actually recited by the narrator, her husband.
Because it emphasizes the finality of death, it calls to question Ligeia's resurrection in the story. Also, the inclusion of the bitter poem may have been meant to be ironic or a parody of the convention at the time, both in literature and in life. In the mid-19th century it was common to emphasize the sacredness of death and the beauty of dying (consider Charles Dickens's Little Johnny character in "Our Mutual Friend" and the death of Helen Burns in Charlotte Brontë's "Jane Eyre"). Instead, Ligeia speaks of fear personified in the "blood-red thing."
"The Conqueror Worm" also uses the word "evermore", which would later evolve into "nevermore" in Poe's famous poem "The Raven" in 1845.
"The Conqueror Worm" was first published as a stand-alone poem in the January 1843 issue of "Graham's Magazine". Shortly after, it was included among several other poems by Poe in the February 25 issue of the "Saturday Museum" in a feature called "The Poets & Poetry of Philadelphia: Edgar Allan Poe". It was later included in Poe's poetry collection "The Raven and Other Poems" in 1845. That same year, it was incorporated into "Ligeia" for the first time when the story was reprinted in the February 15, 1845, issue of the "New York World". "Ligeia" was again republished with "The Conqueror Worm" in the September 27, 1845, issue of "The Broadway Journal" while Poe was its editor. This was not unusual for Poe, who had also incorporated poems "The Coliseum" and "To One in Paradise" into tales.
The British horror movie "Witchfinder General" was retitled "The Conqueror Worm" for US release. It was not based on Poe's poem.

Rufous treepie

The rufous treepie ("Dendrocitta vagabunda") is a species of bird in the Corvidae (crow) family. The rufous treepie is native to the Indian Subcontinent and adjoining parts of Southeast Asia from Pakistan to Vietnam. Woodland, forest edges and gardens are the habitat of this species. It feeds on various fruits, insects and carrion.
The rufous treepie builds its nest 6−8 meters above the ground in trees. Both male and female take turns breeding and feeding the young. There are usually 3-5 eggs laid. After the young have hatched, the remain with their parents for several months. Rufous treepies form pair bonds for life.
The species was first described in 1790 by John Latham. A previous description as "Dendrocitta rufa" is not valid. It belongs to the Treepie genus "Dendrocitta" which is Southeast Asian in distribution. According to ornithologist Derek Goodwin, the rufous treepie may be closely allied to the hooded treepie ("D. frontalis"). There are eight recognized subspecies.
There are no estimates for the population of this species. It is common throughout its range, but rare in Vietnam.
The Rufous Treepie is shorter and smaller than the European magpie. The head, neck and breast are grey, although sometimes they are slightly brown. The underparts and lower back are orange-brown. The tail is a light blue color with a black tip. The bill, legs and feet are black.

Curling

Curling is a sport played on ice. Players slide "curling stones" on the ice towards a target, called the "house". There are two teams with four players on each team. Each team slides eight stones, this is called an "end". After an end the team with the stone closest to the centre of the house (target) scores points. The game is over after eight or ten ends. The team with the most points is the winner.
The player sliding the stone can make it turn or "curl" slowly. Two other players on the team sweep the ice in front of the stone with brooms. This is to make the stone stop in the right place.
Curling is played at the Winter Olympics.
Curling was invented in Scotland in medieval times. It was played outside in the winter because there was lots of ice. Today curling is played all over Europe and in many other countries such as Canada, the United States, Japan and South Korea.
Curling was played at the Winter Olympics for the first time in 1998.
The ice is called a "curling sheet". It is a rectangular sheet of flat ice, between 146 and 150 feet (45-46 metres) long and 14.5 to 15.5 feet (4.4-5.0 metres) wide. The house, or target, is marked at the end of the sheet by coloured rings. The rings help players to aim for the centre of the house. They are also useful to decide which stone is closest to the centre when scoring. There is also a "hack" at the end of the sheet which players push against when sliding a stone.
Curling stones are made of granite. They are heavy, weighing 38-40 pounds (17-20kg). There is a handle on the top of each stone to help slide and turn the stone. The handles are different colours for each team. The stones are usually red for one team and yellow for the other team. 
Curling brooms or brushes are used to sweep the ice in front of the stone when it is sliding. 
Players wear special shoes for curling. One shoe has a smooth surface for sliding on the ice.
The purpose of the game is to score points by getting stones close to the centre of the house. Players from each team take turns to slide a stone towards the house. This is called "delivering" or "throwing" a stone. An end is completed when all stones have been delivered. There are eight stones for each team. The winner is the team with the most points after all ends have been played. There are usually eight or ten ends.
The captain of the team is called the "skip". The skip chooses how hard the stone should be delivered, the direction of delivery, and the amount of turn (curl) that the stone should be given. The skip can choose to aim the stone for the house, hit one of the other team's stones out of play, or make a stone stop before the house as a guard if their team has a stone in a good position.
The player delivering the stone starts at the hack. The skip stands at the other end of the curling sheet behind the house. The skip shows where to aim the stone. The other two players sweep the ice in front of the stone as it slides. The players take turns to deliver stones. When the skip is delivering a stone another player stands behind the house instead.
To deliver a stone the player puts one foot on the hack. The player lines up towards the skip. The stone is on the ice in front of the foot in the hack. The player then slides the stone back before sliding forwards on their other foot. The player lets go of the stone, gently turning the handle just before letting go to give the stone curl.
Then the other players can sweep the stone. Sweeping helps the stone to travel faster, and makes it curl less. The aim of sweeping is to help the stone stop in the right place.
Points are scored at when an end has finished. The team with the stone closest to the centre of the house wins the end. The team scores one point for every stone that is closer to the centre than the other team's closest stone. 
Only stones that are in the house count for scoring. If it is difficult to see which stone is closest to the centre of the house there are special measuring devices to help.
Sometimes neither team scores any points, this is called a "blank end".

Samson and Delilah (opera)

Samson and Delilah (Fr: "Samson et Dalila") is a three-act French opera. It is based on the story of Samson and Delilah in the Old Testament of the Bible. The words and story of the opera (the "libretto") were written by Ferdinand Lemaire. The music was written by Camille Saint-Saëns. The opera was first performed in Weimar, Germany on 2 December 1877. It was sung in German instead of French.
Saint-Saëns thought the Samson story would make a good oratorio. He was persuaded by Lemaire to write an opera on the subject instead. When the opera was completed, Saint-Saëns met some stiff opposition about staging it in France. It was considered sacrilegious to stage a work based on a Bible story. Additionally, Saint-Saëns was considered a "symphonist" rather than an opera composer. People were not interested in "Samson". Liszt staged the work in Germany. It was a hit. It was soon staged in America and in England. 
Roles in the opera include Samson (tenor), Delilah (mezzo-soprano), and the High Priest of Dagon (baritone). The story tells of the enslavement of the Hebrews by the Philistines. Samson urges them to resist their masters. The High Priest of Dagon uses Delilah to destroy Samson. Musical highlights include " and " The opera finally played the Paris Opéra. It ranked second in popularity to Charles Gounod's "Faust".
Saint-Saëns thought the Samson and Delilah story would make a good oratorio. Oratorios were popular in the late 1860s. The city of Paris was offering a prize for a new one. Saint-Saëns asked a relative, Ferdinand Lemaire, to write the libretto. Lemaire thought the story of Samson and Delilah was better suited to an opera. He persuaded Saint-Saëns to write an opera instead of an oratorio. 
Saint-Saëns was drawn to the story because it gave him the opportunity to compose a grand duet against a rising storm. He knew Rameau's take on the story from Voltaire's libretto for an opera on the subject (now lost), but Rameau's storm was a metaphor for the wrath of God. Rossini's "Otello" was nearer to what Saint-Saëns had in mind. He wrote, "I imagined a storm that would no longer be an hors-d'œuvre (a tidbit eaten before a meal) but adhere to the action and become one with it."
Saint-Saëns set to work in 1868. He wrote an aria for Delilah, a duet for Samson and Delilah, and the Prelude. He tried them out at home. Friends weren't very interested. The composer put the work aside for a time. He met Liszt in Weimar, Germany about 1870. Liszt encouraged him to take up the project again. He promised Saint-Saëns he would stage the opera.
In 1873 Saint-Saëns finished the score. Pauline Viardot staged Act 2 in a garden at Croissy. The director of the Paris Opera was present. He found the opera too Wagnerian. He also thought it neglected French opera tradition. Biblical stories were not staged in France. It was considered sacrilegious. Act 1 was performed "concert style" in 1875. This means it was performed without costumes, scenery, or "acting". It was a failure.
Saint-Saëns kept working. He published the score. He wrote a dedication to Viardot. In 1877 Liszt staged the work at the Weimar Court Theatre in Germany. It was sung in German instead of French. The opera was well received. People liked it. Paris wasn't very interested, though. In 1890 the opera was staged in Rouen at composer Gabriel Faure's urging. It was staged the same year in Paris. Two years later it was finally staged at the Paris Opéra. The opera ranked second in popularity to Gounod's "Faust".
Once the opera gained favor with audiences it quickly spread outside France. The first production in America was at New Orleans in 1893. In 1894 it was staged at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. In these early days, productions were mounted in Milan, St Petersburg, and Moscow. French singers walked out on a concert performance in London in 1893. They were expected to sing in English instead of French. Biblical stories were banned from the stage in Britain. The first full production of "Samson" took place in 1909. King Edward VII of England was said to have helped get the opera staged.
Goodwin writes that Saint-Saëns's pupil and friend Gabriel Faure always said that the reason "Samson and Delilah" met with disinterest in France was the fact that the composer was viewed as a symphonistnot because the opera was based on a Biblical text. "Symphonist" was a pejorative term at the time. It was tossed about by opera and ballet fans. "Samson and Delilah" was also a departure from 19th century opera traditions. This was another reason for some to ignore it. It was a three-act opera rather than a standard five-act opera as laid down by Meyerbeer. The opera featured only three principal charactersSamson, Delilah, and the High Priestthus creating another departure from the norm. 
Saint-Saëns was almost an atheist. He did not point out a moral in this opera but let the work speak for itself. He admired the operas of Verdi. He liked the oratorios of Handel and Mendelssohntwo composers whose influence is felt in the choruses of "Samson". He framed the central seduction scene with the two outer acts. In contrast with Samson (strength) and the High Priest (power), Delilah is a character of "seductive" strength and power. She wants Samson on her sidenot for lovebut for her own vanity and sexual gratification. She puts everything she has into successfully seducing him because, if she fails, her head will be on the chopping block.
In a square in Gaza, the Hebrews pray for release from slavery to the Philistines. Samson tries to lift their spirits. Abimelech taunts the Hebrews. He says his god Dagon is greater than the Hebrew god. Samson defies him. Abimelech attacks Samson with a sword. Samson disarms and kills him. The Hebrews flee. The High Priest of Dagon makes plans to use Delilah to trap Samson. 
Delilah enters with the priestesses of Dagon. She flirts with Samson. She invites him to her home in Sorek. An old Hebrew warns Samson about loving Delilah. Samson prays for God's protection. Delilah and the priestesses begin to dance. Samson fights his desire for Delilah. The old Hebrew repeats his warning. As the curtain closes, Samson meets Delilah's gaze. It is clear he will join her in Sorek.
In Sorek Delilah sings about her power over Samson. The High Priest arrives. He reports that Samson and the Hebrews have destroyed the harvest. He offers gold to Delilah to trap Samson. She refuses to take the money. She wants only revenge. Delilah vows to find the secret of Samson's strength. The High Priest leaves.
Delilah considers her chances of success. Samson arrives to say farewell. He plans to lead the Hebrew revolt. Delilah tells Samson that she loves him. He admits that he loves her. They sing rapturously. Delilah wants to know the secret of his strength. Samson will not tell her. She weeps and runs into her house. Samson follows. She learns the secret of his strength. She calls to Philistine soldiers hiding nearby. They capture Samson and blind him.
Samson is chained to a mill-wheel in a dungeon. He prays for his people. They will suffer for his sin. Samson offers his life as a sacrifice. The Hebrews are heard in the distance singing sorrowfully. 
The Philistines are preparing a victory celebration in the temple of Dagon. The priests and priestesses sing softly. The priests dance a wild Bacchanale. Samson enters led by a boy. He is mocked by the High Priest. Delilah taunts him. The priests try to force him to kneel before a statue of Dagon. The boy leads him to the two main pillars in the temple. Samson prays for strength. He pulls down the pillars. The temple collapses. Samson is crushed with his enemies beneath the stones.

Mon cœur s'ouvre à ta voix

"Mon cœur s'ouvre à ta voix" is a mezzo-soprano aria from Camille Saint-Saëns's opera "Samson and Delilah". It is known in English as "Softly awakes my heart", or "My heart opens itself to your voice". It is sung by Delilah in act 2 as she tries to get Samson to reveal the secret of his great strength.
In the opera, Delilah is responding to Samson's words ""Dalila! Dalila! Je t'aime!" (Delilah! Delilah! I love you!) which he repeats between the first and second verses of her aria. These interjections are omitted in recital performances or sometimes sung to the changed words "Samson! Samson! Je t'aime!". Samson's part in the final 22 bars of the stage aria where he joins Delilah in a duet is also omitted in a recital, although some performers, notably Marilyn Horne, have sung Samson's final words – changed as above, rising to a high B-flat. A performance takes between 5 1/2 and 6 1/2 minutes.
The aria is written in D-flat major. The verse has a time signatures of 3/4 but the refrain ("Ah! réponds"") has a time signature of 4/4. The tempo indication is "andantino" (=66) for the verse and "un poco più lento" (a little slower) for the refrain. The vocal range extends from B-flat to G-flat, with a tessitura from E-flat to E-flat.
The instrumentation calls for flute, oboe, clarinet, horns, harp and strings. All instrument lines, except the harp, make intensive use of divisi (cellos play in four divisi). The orchestral accompaniment consists mainly of reiterated notes for the first verse and of falling chromatic lines for the second verse. The refrain is accompanied by ascending broken chords.
The melismatic setting of the lyrics present a particular challenge for the performance of this aria as it requires legato singing over a wide range.

Der Hölle Rache

"Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen" () is an aria for the Queen of the Night in Mozart's opera "The Magic Flute" (). Mozart's friend Emanuel Schikaneder wrote the words. The aria is written in D minor. The voice ranges over two octaves. It is known for being difficult to perform well. Mozart's sister-in-law Josepha Hofer was the first to sing the aria on stage.
The Queen of the Night is a role for a coloratura soprano. She has two arias in the opera. The other is "Oh, tremble not, my beloved son" (""). Both arias are famous. "Hell's vengeance" is highly memorable, fast paced and menacingly grandiose.
The aria is written in D minor. It is scored for pairs of flutes, oboes, bassoons, horns, trumpets, timpani, and the string section. It is a larger orchestra than that for "". It comprises all the players from the opera as a whole, except the clarinets and trombones.
The aria is sung in act 2. It is famous for being difficult to perform well. The Queen of the Night is in a fit of rage. She gives a knife to her daughter Pamina. She tells her to kill the priest Sarastro. If she refuses, the Queen will curse her. The aria's range is two octaves, from F to F and requires a very high tessitura.
The first singer to perform the aria onstage was Mozart's sister-in-law Josepha Hofer. She was 33. Mozart wrote the two "Magic Flute" arias to showcase her voice. He was very impressed with Hofer's performance. In the fifth week of the opera's run, Mozart lay dying. He whispered to his wife Constanze on December 4, 1791: "Quiet, quiet! Hofer is just taking her top F; – now my sister-in-law is singing her second aria, "Der Hölle Rache"; how strongly she strikes and holds the B-flat: "
The words were written (in German) by Mozart's friend Emanuel Schikaneder, who also played Papageno in the first performances.

Lorenzo da Ponte

Lorenzo da Ponte (March 10, 1749 – August 17, 1838) was an opera librettist and poet. He is best known for having written the libretti for three of Mozart's operas, "The Marriage of Figaro", "Don Giovanni", and "Così fan tutte".
Da Ponte was born Emanuele Conegliano to Jewish parents near Venice, Italy. He became a Christian, and took the name Lorenzo da Ponte from the bishop who baptized him. He was became a priest at the church of San Luca in Venice. He took Anzoletta Bellaudi as his mistress. They ran a brothel. Da Ponte was banished from Venice for 15 years. He went to Austria where he became court librettist to Emperor Joseph II.
About 1792, da Ponte married Ann Celestine Grahl. They had four children. When Joseph II died, da Ponte lost his job. He went to London. He got into debt, and went to the United States. He ran a grocery store in Pennsylvania for a short time. He moved to New York City and opened a bookstore. He became the first professor of Italian literature at Columbia College. He produced "Don Giovanni" in New York in 1826. In 1828, da Ponte became a naturalized US citizen.
Da Ponte died in 1838 in New York. His funeral was held in New York's old St. Patrick's Cathedral. His final resting place is uncertain. All of da Ponte's libretti were adaptations of pre-existing plots, except "L'arbore di Diana" and "Così fan tutte". His adaptations are of the highest order. The Don Giovanni character was given new life in da Ponte's hands. The character is now considered the archetypical libertine.

Magnetic pendulum

A magnetic pendulum is an experiment where a metal ball on a thread (a pendulum) can be influenced by a number of magnets on the ground. The length of the rope is such that the ball cannot touch the magnets, but is still influenced by them. If the ball is moved, its movement will be influenced by both gravitation and the fields the magnets generate. If the movement is so large that the ball can get outside the influence of the magnets, the resulting movement will look irregular. While it is deterministic, it will depend on the starting conditions—that is the position of the ball at the start. This has been called deterministic chaos.

Amahl and the Night Visitors

Amahl and the Night Visitors is a one-act opera. The words and music were written by Gian Carlo Menotti. Menotti took inspiration from Hieronymus Bosch's "The Adoration of the Magi", a painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. 
"Amahl" was the first opera written for television. Its first performance was on Christmas Eve 1951 on NBC. It was the first show in the famous "Hallmark Hall of Fame" series. About five million people watched the program. It was the largest audience to ever see an opera on television. "Amahl" was shown every year until 1966. 
Menotti wanted Amahl to always be performed by a boy. He wrote, "It is the express wish of the composer that the role of Amahl should always be performed by a boy. Neither the musical nor the dramatic concept of the opera permits the substitution of a woman costumed as a child."
Amahl is a crippled shepherd boy who uses a crutch. He sees a huge star in the night sky. His mother thinks he is lying and sends him to bed. She worries that they will become beggars. 
There is a knock at the door. Three kings ask for a place to rest. They are on their way to Bethlehem to find a newborn child. Amahl pesters them with many questions. Shepherds arrive to dance for the kings. The kings grow sleepy and the shepherds go home. 
The room is dark and everyone is asleep. The mother tries to steal a piece of gold from the kings. She is caught by their servant. Amahl wakes and beats the servant. He falls exhausted. The kings tell the mother to keep the gold. They tell her the wonderful baby they are seeking has no need for gold because his kingdom is Heaven. 
Amahl offers his crutch to this wonderful baby. He takes a few stumbling steps. A miracle has occurred. He can walk. He leaves with the kings to give his crutch to the baby himself. His mother waves good-bye.

The Medium

The Medium is a two-act opera with words and music by Gian Carlo Menotti. It was commissioned by Columbia University. Its first performance was there on May 8, 1946. The opera's first professional production was presented on a double bill with Menotti's "The Telephone". This occurred at the Heckscher Theater, New York City, on February 18-20, 1947 by the Ballet Society. The Broadway production took place on May 1, 1947, at the Ethel Barrymore Theater with the same cast. In 1951, Menotti directed, with the help of filmmaker Alexander Hammid, a movie version made to resemble film noir. It starred Anna Maria Alberghetti. A live television production starring Marie Powers took place on December 12, 1948 on the TV series "Studio One".
"The medium's parlor"
Monica, Madame Flora's daughter, and Toby, a mute servant boy rescued from "the streets of Budapest" play dress-up. When Madame Flora, or "Baba" as they call her, arrives home drunk, she violently chastises them for not preparing for that night's seance. Soon the guests arrive, Mr. and Mrs. Gobineau, regulars, and the widow Mrs. Nolan who is attending for the first time. With Madame Flora in a trance in her chair, a fake seance is held where Mrs. Nolan speaks with what she thinks is her deceased sixteen-year-old daughter but is really Monica behind a screen. As Monica disappears, Mrs. Nolan rushes toward the figure and is restrained by the Gobineaus. When order is restored, Mr. and Mrs. Gobineau "communicate" with their deceased two-year-old son Mickey who does nothing but laugh. After they say goodbye to him, Madame Flora "suddenly, with a loud gasp... clutches at her throat with both hands." She feels a phantom hand clutching her throat and is "terror-stricken." After demanding that the guests leave, she calls for Monica and tells her what she felt, eventually blaming Toby who was in the other room the whole time. In an effort to calm Baba's drunken rage toward Toby, Monica sings her the dark lullaby "The Black Swan" which is interrupted by a voice that Baba hears causing her to fly into a terrified rage at Toby for not telling her where the voice is coming from. The act ends with Monica again singing the lullaby while Baba recites her Hail Marys.
"A few days later"
Toby is giving a puppet show for Monica, their mutual love becomes more obvious. When Baba comes home, she resumes her accusations on Toby, sure that he knows what went on that night. The guests again arrive, expecting another seance but are driven away by Madame Flora who tries to convince them that the whole thing was a sham by revealing all the tricks that she and Monica used. But the guests are not convinced and leave claiming that while she might have thought she was cheating them, she in fact was not. Once the guests are gone, she drives Toby out despite Monica's pleas on his behalf. With everyone gone, and Monica in her room, Baba pours herself another drink and questions her own sanity, becoming wild with drink and eventually passing out. Once she has fallen asleep, Toby sneaks back in and tries to get into Monica's room, but finds it locked and eventually goes to the trunk to find his tambourine. While searching, he knocks the lid of the trunk down waking Baba. Toby quickly hides in the puppet theater. As Baba tries to see where the noise came from and fetches a revolver from a drawer in the table. "Hysterically" she shouts out "Who is it? Speak or I'll Shoot!" and the puppet theater curtain moves. "Baba screams and fires at it several times." As Toby's bloody body collapses grasping the curtain, Baba says "I've killed the ghost! I've killed the ghost!" Monica, hearing the gunshots, enters, sees Toby's lifeless body and runs for help. As the final curtain falls "very slowly" Baba asks "in a hoarse whisper," "Was it you?"

Negro

The word “Negro” is used in the English-speaking world to refer to a person of black ancestry or appearance. It has been used for people of African ancestry as well as people from other places. The word "negro" means 'black' in Spanish and Portuguese. It comes from the Latin "niger" which means 'black'.
"Negro" replaced the term "colored" as the most polite term. This was done when the term "black" was more offensive. This use of the word was accepted as normal until the Civil Rights Movement in the late 1960s. It was accepted even by the people it was used to describe. One example of this is Martin Luther King, Jr. using the term "negro" when talking about his own race in his 1963 speech "I Have a Dream."
During the Civil Rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s, some African-American leaders in the United States did not like this word. People like Malcolm X wanted the word "Black" to be used. This was because they saw a connection between the term "Negro" and slavery, segregation, and discrimination.
Since the late 1960s, many other terms have been more commonly used. These include "Black", "Black African", "Afro-American" and "African American". African American is used in the United States to refer to Black Americans. These people were often called American Negroes in the past.
The term "Negro" is still used in some ways. It is used by the United Negro College Fund and the Negro league in sports.
The United States Census Bureau said that "Negro" would be used on the 2010 United States Census, with "Black" and "African-American". This was because some older Black Americans still feel this is the word that describes them.
Around 1442 the Portuguese first went to sub-Saharan Africa. They were trying to find a way to get to India by boat. The term "negro" was used by the Spanish and Portuguese as a simple description of people. It means "black". From the 18th century to the late 1960s, "negro" was the proper English-language term for most people of sub-Saharan African origin.
Most people stopped using the word "Negro" by the early 1970s in the United States. Many older African Americans grew up when "Negro" was "widely" said to be the correct term. They thought the term "Black" was more offensive than "Negro." This can be seen by the use the word by historical African-American organizations and institutions. Currently, "Negro" is "generally" thought to be not offensive when used in a historical way. For example, baseball's Negro Leagues of the early and mid-20th century. It is also used in the name of older organizations. These include Negro spirituals, the United Negro College Fund or the Journal of Negro Education. The U.S. Census now uses "Black, African-American or Negro." The term "Negro" is used to try to include older African Americans who think it is a better term.
The word "Negroid" was used by 19th and 20th century racial anthropologists. The suffix -oid means "similar to". "Negroid" as a noun was used to name a larger category of people than "Negro".

Serenade for Strings

Serenade for Strings in C major, Op. 48 is a work for string orchestra by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It premiered in 1880. The serenade consists of four movements:
Tchaikovsky intended the first movement to be an imitation of Mozart's style. It was based on the form of the classical sonatina, with a slow introduction. The 36-bar "Andante" introduction is marked "sempre marcatissimo". It is littered with double-stopping in the violins and violas. This introduction returns at the end of the movement. It reappears, transformed, in the coda of the fourth movement. Tchaikovsky intended the work for a large string orchestra. On the second page of the score, he wrote, "The larger the string orchestra, the better will the composer's desires be fulfilled." George Balanchine used the work for his ballet "Serenade" in 1934Excerpts from the score were used in the 2005 ballet "Anna Karenina", choreographed by Boris Eifman. The waltz was arranged for soprano and full orchestra for the 1945 MGM movie "Anchors Aweigh". It was performed by Kathryn Grayson with José Iturbi conducting the MGM studio orchestra.

Ancient philosophy

Ancient philosophy is a historical classification that is used for the philosophy in Europe, namely that of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. Diogenes Laërtius, a 3rd-century scholar wrote Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, which summarized the position of many Ancient Greek philosophers. This work was translated into Latin and meant that Ancient Greek philosophy remained known even after Library of Alexandria lost its influence. Most of Ancient philosophy was forgotten after the 6th century. After this, it was mainly through Islamic thinkers such as Avicenna (11th century), Averroës (12th century), or the Jewish philosopher Maimonides (12th century) that Ancient philosophy became known again. Medieval philosophy, such as that of Albertus Magnus (13th century) or Thomas Aquinas meant that the works of thinkers such as Aristotle were well known.

He was the first to be able to determine the temperature with precision. His thermometers used Ethyl alcohol at first, but he later switched to using mercury. When he read an article by Guillaume Amontons about using mercury in barometers, he got the idea of using that substance for his thermometers. He calinbrated them to a temperature he could produce easily, -17.8 C. 
In the year 1721 he discovered that water can be cooled below its freezing point without actually turning into ice. 
Fahrenheit also developed a hydrometer, a pycnometer and a hypsobarometer

Mandingo (movie)

Mandingo is a 1975 movie based on the book "Mandingo" by Kyle Onstott and upon the play based thereon by Jack Kirkland. The movie was directed by Richard Fleischer. The movie tells the story of a plantation family and their slaves. The movie was a box office hit, but critical reviews were mixed.
The movie is set on Falconhurst, a run-down plantation owned by widower Warren Maxwell and his son Hammond. Hammond's Mandingo slave Ganymede, or Mede is trained to fight other slaves. Hammond neglects his wife Blanche whom he rejects on their wedding night after discovering she was not a virgin. Hammond instead rapes his slave Ellen while Blanche forces Mede to lay with her. These various, conflicting infidelities all eventually come together causing the movie to end tragically with the deaths of most of the main characters.
Upon its release in 1975, critical response was mixed although box office was strong. Roger Ebert despised the film and gave it a "zero star" rating. Richard Schickel of "TIME" found the film boring and cliché-ridden. Movie critic Robin Wood was enthusiastic about the movie, calling it “the greatest film about race ever made in Hollywood”. In Leonard Maltin's annual publication "Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide" the movie is ranked as a "BOMB" and dismissed with the word "Stinko!" 
Some prominent critics hail the film, including the "New York Times" columnist Dave Kehr, who called it "a thinly veiled Holocaust film that spares none of its protagonists," further describing it as "Fleischer’s last great crime film, in which the role of the faceless killer is played by an entire social system." Director Quentin Tarantino has cited "Mandingo" as one of only two instances "in the last twenty years [that] a major studio made a full-on, gigantic, big-budget exploitation movie", comparing it to "Showgirls".

He stated that his first studio album Gazing at the Moonlight was released without his consent and that he wasn't even able to listen to the mastered version before it was released. He left the label when Tomica said "He doesn't do his job as an artist". Hopsin would found an independent label called Funk Volume with business partner Dame Ritter.

Learner's permit

A learner's permit can also be called a driver's permit, learner's license, or provisional license. It is given to those who are learning to drive a car but do not meet the requirements for a driver's license. Many countries require drivers to have a learner's permit for some time before they can be given a driver's license.
Getting a learner's permit usually means a person has to take a written test about the rules of the road, such as traffic signs and road safety. There is also a minimum age. Depending on the area, the minimum age can range from 14 to 19 years. 
For example, in Victoria, Australia, a person must be 16 years old and pass a written road rules test to get a Learner's permit. The written test consists of 32 questions on road rules; and 25 must be answered correctly. The person must also pass an eyesight test. There are restrictions on what a person with a Victorian learner's permit can do. They must have a sign with the letter "L" (called an L plate) on both the front and back of the car. They must have a fully licenced driver with them at all times. They are not allowed to drive if they have drunk any alcohol. They are not allowed to tow anything behind the car. They must have the learner's permit for 12 months, and completed 120 hours before they allowed to be tested for a full licence.

S-block

The s-block is one of four blocks of elements on the periodic table. The s-block group have a common property. The electron in their most outward electron shell are in the s-orbital. Elements in the s-block are in the first two periodic table groups. The elements in group one are called the alkali metals. The elements in group two are called the alkaline earth metals.
The modern periodic law says that "The properties of elements are periodic function of their atomic number." This means that some properties of elements are repeated as the atomic number of the elements gets larger. These repeating properties have been used to separate the elements into four blocks. These blocks are s-block, p-block, d-block, and f-block. 
All of the s-block elements are metals. In general, they are shiny, silvery, good conductors of heat and electricity. They lose their valence electrons easily. In fact, they lose their trademark "s" orbital valence electrons so easily that the s-block elements are some of the most reactive elements on the periodic table.
The elements in group 1, known collectively as the alkali metals (except hydrogen), always lose their one valence electron to make a +1 ion. These metals are characterized by being silvery, very soft, not very dense and having low melting points. These metals react extremely vigorously with water and even oxygen to produce energy and flammable hydrogen gas. They are kept in mineral oil to reduce the chance of an unwanted reaction or worse, an explosion.
The elements in group 2, known as the alkaline earth metals (except helium), always lose their two valence electrons to make a +2 ion. Like the alkali metals, the alkaline earth metals are silvery, shiny and relatively soft. Some of the elements in this column also react vigorously with water and must be stored carefully.
S-block elements are famous for being ingredients in fireworks. The ionic forms of potassium, strontium and barium make appearances in firework displays as the brilliant purples, reds and greens.
Francium is considered to be the most rare naturally occurring element on earth. It is estimated that there is only ever one natural atom of Francium present on earth at a time. Francium has a very unstable nucleus and undergoes nuclear decay rapidly. 
The first element in group one, Lithium, and the first in group two, Beryllium, behave differently to other members of their groups. Their behaviour is like the second element of the next group. So lithium is similar to magnesium, and beryllium is similar to aluminum.
In the periodic table this is known as a 'diagonal relationship'. The diagonal relationship is because of similarities in ionic sizes and charge/radius ratio of the element. The similarity between lithium and magnesium is because of their similar sizes:
Lithium has many different behaviours to other elements in group one. This difference caused by:
Some of the ways in which lithium behaves differently from other members of are:

The Corsair was used by the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marines, Fleet Air Arm and the Royal New Zealand Air Force, as well as the French Navy "Aéronavale" and other, smaller, air forces. It became the most capable carrier-based fighter-bomber of World War II. Some Japanese pilots said it was the best American fighter of World War II, and the U.S. Navy reported an 11:1 kill ratio. As well as being a great fighter, the Corsair proved to be an excellent fighter-bomber.

Douglas Sirk

Douglas Sirk (April 26, 1897 – January 14, 1987) was a movie director. He is best known for his lush romantic movies of the 1950s such as "All That Heaven Allows". His movies were thought banal and unimportant by contemporary critics. Today however they are regarded as masterpieces and ironic commentaries on American life and society. 
Sirk was born Hans Detlef Sierck in Hamburg, Germany. His parent were Danish. He grew up in Denmark, but moved to Germany as a teenager. His theater career began in 1922 and his movie career in 1934. He left Germany in 1937. By 1942 he was directing movies in Hollywood. He is famous for lush romantic movies made between 1952 and 1958. At the height of his career, he quit making movies. He left the United States. Sirk died in Lugano, Switzerland about thirty years later. In 1985, he was awarded the Bavarian Film Award, Honorary Award.
Sirk's movies were very successful at the box office, but the critics did not like them. They thought his movies unimportant and banal because they were about women and exaggerated emotions. His conspicuous style was considered unrealistic. Critical opinion changed in the 1970s. Analysis revealed Sirk's movies actually criticized American society beneath a banal surface plot. His movies are now regarded as masterpieces of irony. Sirk's reputation was also helped by a widespread nostalgia for old-fashioned Hollywood films. His movies have influenced other directors. Todd Haynes's "Far From Heaven", for example, is a conscious attempt to replicate a typical Sirk movie. Roger Ebert has remarked that "To appreciate a film like "Written on the Wind" probably takes more sophistication than to understand one of Ingmar Bergman's masterpieces, because Bergman's themes are visible and underlined, while with Sirk the style conceals the message."

Written on the Wind

Written on the Wind is a 1956 romantic drama movie. It stars Rock Hudson, Lauren Bacall, Robert Stack, and Dorothy Malone. Douglas Sirk directed. The movie is based on Robert Wilder's 1945 novel of the same name. The book is a thinly disguised account of the real-life scandal involving torch singer Libby Holman and her husband, tobacco heir Zachary Smith Reynolds. Dorothy Malone won the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her performance.
Marylee is a self-destructive, alcoholic nymphomaniac. Her brother Kyle is an insecure, alcoholic playboy. They are the spoiled children of Texas oil baron Jasper Hadley. The two are crippled by their personal demons. Neither is able to sustain a personal relationship. 
Problems begin when Kyle marries Lucy Moore. He resumes drinking after failing to father a child. He turns against his childhood friend, Mitch Wayne. Kyle's anger and depression deepen after the death of his father. Jasper had admired Mitch, but was disgusted with his own two children.
Mitch is secretly in love with Lucy. He keeps these feelings private. Kyle is diagnosed with a low sperm count. Lucy announces she is pregnant. Kyle assaults her. He thinks the baby belongs to Mitch. The assault results in a miscarriage. Mitch vows to leave town with Lucy as soon as she's well enough to travel. A drunken Kyle grabs a pistol. He intends to shoot Mitch. Marylee struggles with her brother. The pistol accidentally fires. Kyle is killed.
Marylee has long been infatuated with Mitch. He has repeatedly spurned her. She spitefully threatens to name Mitch as Kyle's killer. At the inquest, she first testifies that he killed Kyle. At the last moment she admits the truth. Mitch and Lucy leave. Marylee is left alone to mourn her brother's death.
Bosley Crowther wrote in the "New York Times", "The trouble with this romantic picture ... is that nothing really happens, the complications within the characters are never clear and the sloppy, self-pitying fellow at the center of the whole thing is a bore." "TV Guide" describes the film as "the ultimate in lush melodrama ... Douglas Sirk's finest directorial effort ... one of the most notable critiques of the American family ever made."
Roger Ebert writes, "a perverse and wickedly funny melodrama in which you can find the seeds of "Dallas", "Dynasty", and all the other prime-time soaps. Sirk is the one who established their tone, in which shocking behavior is treated with passionate solemnity, while parody burbles beneath ... To appreciate a film like "Written on the Wind" probably takes more sophistication than to understand one of Ingmar Bergman's masterpieces, because Bergman's themes are visible and underlined, while with Sirk the style conceals the message. His interiors are wildly over the top, and his exteriors are phony - he wants you to notice the artifice, to see that he's not using realism but an exaggerated Hollywood studio style ... Films like this are both above and below middle-brow taste. If you only see the surface, it's trashy soap opera. If you can see the style, the absurdity, the exaggeration and the satirical humor, it's subversive of all the 1950s dramas that handled such material solemnly. William Inge and Tennessee Williams were taken with great seriousness during the decade, but Sirk kids their Freudian hysteria."

Moving the goalposts

Moving the goalposts or shifting the goalposts is an idiom which means changing the terms of a debate or a conflict after it has started. 
The phrase describes changing the target or goal of a process. In a dispute or a competition, the idiom explains what one side does in order to gain advantage.
This phrase comes from sports that use s, such as football. 
In 1978, the "Washington Post" published the phrase, quoting the CEO of American Airlines who said, "'They keep moving the goal posts." In Britain, the earliest known published use was in 1987. 
The idiom identifies a kind of logical fallacy. In an argument, when evidence is presented in response to a specific claim, it is "moving the goalposts" when some other evidence is demanded instead. Idioms are a common stumbling block for learners of a language.
In other words, after an attempt has been made to score a goal, the goalposts are moved to exclude the attempt. The problem with changing the rules of the game is that the meaning of the end result is changed too. It counts for less.
The tactics of bullying behaviour include moving the goalposts. This means setting objectives which subtly change in ways that cannot be reached. In workplace bullying, shifting the goalposts is a conventional tactic.

The BFG 9000 is a fictional futuristic weapon. It is found in the Doom video game series. The BFG 9000 is a very large, solid metal gun. It shoot balls of green plasma. It is the most powerful weapon in the games. The BFG 9000 can destroy almost any player or enemy in one hit. "Quake II" and "Quake III Arena" pay homage to the BFG 9000 with weapons called the BFG10K. The "Quake III Arena" version works differently than the BFG 9000. It shoots many small plasma beams very quickly instead of one large ball. This means the BFG 9000 causes much more damage in a single hit than the "Arena" BFG10K.
The abbreviation "BFG" stands for "Big Fucking Gun". This is the name is was given in Tom Hall's first "Doom" design document. In the "Doom II" user manual, BFG is said to stand for "Big Fuckin Gun".

Sleeping Beauty

"Sleeping Beauty" () is a fairy tale. There are several versions of it, including "The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood" by Charles Perrault and "Briar Rose" or "Little Briar Rose" () by the Brothers Grimm. The story is about a princess who falls into a deep sleep for one hundred years, and is awoken by a heroic prince.
Perrault's version first appeared in 1695 in a hand-written and illustrated manuscript called "Tales of Mother Goose" () along with "Little Red Riding Hood", "Bluebeard", "Puss in Boots", and "Diamonds and Toads". It was next published in the newspaper "Mercure galant" in 1696. It was revised, and published in Paris in 1697 by Claude Barbin in "Histoires ou contes du temps passé" (), a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault. It has been adapted to various media including a pantomime by James Robinson Planché, a ballet, and a Disney animated movie.
The Grimms published their version in "Children's and Household Tales" () in 1812. 
Tales similar to Perrault's include one from the 14th-century Catalan collection "Frayre de Joy e Sor de Placer", the story of Brynhild from the "Saga of the Volsungs", "Troylus and Zelladine" from the 16th-century French work "Perceforest", and "Sun, Moon, and Talia" from Giambattista Basile's "Pentamerone" (1636).
There are slight differences between the Grimms's version of the sleeping princess tale and that of Perrault. The Grimms's Briar Rose is released from her sleep by a kiss from the prince while Perrault's princess wakes when the prince simply kneels beside her.
Maria Tatar writes, "The Grimms' "Sleeping Beauty" has a narrative integrity that has made it more appealing than [Basile and Perrault], at least in the United States." She explains that the version of the Grimms discards the post-marital conflicts of Basile and Perrault that were probably separate narratives at one time. Tatar believes Briar Rose is the stereotypical passive fairy tale heroine who simply waits for a man to come along to free her from a near catatonic state.
A king and queen long for a child. A frog in the queen's bath foretells the future birth of a baby. The queen gives birth to a daughter. The king and queen host a celebration (a christening in the Perrault version). In the Perrault version, they invite seven good fairies; in the Grimms' version, they invite twelve "wise women". Another, evil woman (or fairy) appears who puts a curse on the infant princess. She says that the princess will one day prick her finger on the spindle of a spindle and die. One of the good women softens the curse. Instead of dying, the princess will sleep for one hundred years.
The king orders all spindles to be burnt to protect his daughter. When she is about fifteen or sixteen, however, the princess finds an old woman spinning in a tower room. The princess handles the spindle and pricks her finger. She falls into a deep sleep. The good fairy puts everyone in the castle to sleep. A thorny forest or a hedge of roses springs up and surrounds the castle to protect the sleeping princess.
One hundred years pass. A prince has heard fabulous tales of the place and wants to find the princess. He arrives at the castle and finds the sleeping princess in the tower room. In the Grimms' version, he wakes her with a kiss; Perrault's princess wakes when the prince simply kneels beside her. The prince and the princess get married.
The Perrault version continues further. The prince and princess have two children. The prince goes off to war. His wife and children stay with his mother. She is an ogress. She wants to eat her guests. A servant saves them. The ogress is furious. She decides to put the princess and her children into a cauldron filled with toads and snakes. The prince arrives. His wife and children are saved. The ogress jumps head first into the cauldron and dies.

Grimms' Fairy Tales

Children's and Household Tales (), commonly known as Grimms' Fairy Tales (), is a collection of German fairy tales published by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, the Brothers Grimm.
On December 20, 1812, the Grimms published the first volume of the first edition. It contained 86 stories. The second volume of 70 stories was published in 1814. For the second edition, two volumes were issued in 1819 and a third in 1822, totalling 170 tales. The third edition appeared in 1837; fourth edition, 1840; fifth edition, 1843; sixth edition, 1850; seventh edition, 1857. Stories were added, and also deleted, from one edition to the next, until the seventh held 211 tales. All editions were extensively illustrated, first by Philipp Grot Johann and, after his death in 1892, by Robert Leinweber.
The first volumes were much criticized because they were considered unsuitable for children, both for the scholarly information included and the subject matter. Many changes through the editions – such as turning the wicked mother of the first edition in "Snow White" and "Hansel and Gretel" to a stepmother, were probably made with an eye to such criticism. They removed sexual references—such as Rapunzel's innocently asking why her dress was getting tight around her belly, and thus naïvely revealing her pregnancy and the prince's visits to her stepmother—but, in many respects, violence, particularly when punishing villains, was increased. In 1825, the Grimms published their "Kleine Ausgabe" or "small edition," a selection of 50 tales designed for child readers. This children's version went through ten editions between 1825 and 1858.
The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe, in a spirit of romantic nationalism, that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence. Among those influenced were the Russian Alexander Afanasyev, the Norwegians Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe, the English Joseph Jacobs, and Jeremiah Curtin, an American who collected Irish tales.

Marius Petipa (1818-1910) was a French dancer and the principal Ballet Master for the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg from 1869 until 1903. His works include "La Bayadere" (1877), a revised "Giselle" (1884), "The Sleeping Beauty" (1890), a revised "Swan Lake" (1895), and "Raymonda" (1898). Dance historian Lynn Garafola believes Petipa "had an incalculable effect on Russian ballet." She points out that he supervised the transition from Romanticism to Classicism in Russian ballet, and fused the Italian bravura and French lyrical techniques. Garafola writes, "[Petipa] helped transform an art dominated by foreigners and identified with the West into a Russian national expression."

Amount of substance (also called chemical amount) is a quantity defined by standards to measures the size a group of individual elementary entities, such as atoms, molecules and electrons, along with other particles. The International System of Units (SI) defines the amount of substance to be equal to the number of elementary entities present. The SI unit for amount of substance is the mole (mol). The mole is defined as the amount of substance that contains the same number of elementary entities as there are atoms in of the isotope carbon-12. This number is called Avogadro's number and has the value . It is the numerical value of the Avogadro constant which has the unit (or mol), and relates the molar mass of an amount of substance to its mass.

Patiala state

Patiala was a Sikh princely state that lasted from 1714 to 1948. Its rulers were descended from Chaudhary Phul (1627-1689), a Sidhu Jat from Mehraj village in the Bathinda District of Punjab. The other Sikh states, such as Jind and Nabha, were also the descendants of Phul. Its capital was in the Malva region of Punjab, but its territory expanded from Bathinda to present-day Mohali. They were known as the Phulkian (Patiala) Dynasty.
The House of Phul, was a Jatt of Sidhu Clan, belonging to the Malva Region of Punjab. Their ancestors had converted to Sikhism in the early 1600s. They claim to be the descendants from the Rajput Bhatti rulers of Jaisalmer, who ruled in the 11th century. The migrated to the Malva region of Punjab, establishing themselves at present day Bathinda District of Punjab. 
The Sidhu Jatts and the Bhullar Jatts of the Bathinda district, never got along with each other, They were at war. But later Nanu Bhullar, got his daughter married in the house of these Sidhu Jatts, the ancestors of the Patiala State. 
They were known as the Phulkian (Patiala) Dynasty. Ahmed Shah Abdali, Afghan Ruler and Maharaja Ala Singh became friends, the Sikh Chieftains of Punjab did not Like this so the Dal Khalsa met at Akal Takhat in Amritsar in 1765, in which it was decided that Patiala should be kicked out of the Dal Khalsa. And it will not be part of the 12 Sikh Confederacies, it was also the year when Ala Singh died and his son Amar Singh had become the next ruler. Ahmed Shah Abdali, bestowed upon Maharajah Amar Singh, the title of Raja-i-Rajgan, and he also was allowed to strike his own coins. But the Sikh Nation was not to happy about this, and in years to come they the Phulkians would be traitors to the Khalsa Panth, and helping the British to attack the Sikh interior of Punjab. 
Even when Sardar Hari Singh Dhillon (r.1746-1764), the Sikh Bhangi Misl Maharaja of Amritsar, Tarn Taran Sahib and Lahore, found out about Ahmed Shah Abdali being in the Patiala Kingdom, he marched with a big army of dashing looking Sikh soldiers from the Majha, where the holy city of Amritsar is located, on Patiala Kingdom to chase the Ahmed Shah away, but on the way he was killed, by someone. Years later his younger son Sardar Ganda Singh Dhillon (d. 1776), the Maharajah of Lahore and Amritsar, married of his daughter Bibi Rattan Kaur, to Maharajah Sahib Singh of Patiala in 1787, the marriage took place at Amritsar. Five years later he remarried Bibi As kaur, the daughter of Sardar Gurdas Singh Chatha. It is As kaur, who's Sons and Grandsons ruled on. 
From 1809-1947, the Phulkian State, had good relations with the British Government, the Patiala State, royal family, were not Orthodox Sikhs, but very secular/mixed rulers. Very mixed with the East India Company. A time when the Sikh Kingdoms did not like British, visiting their Land, Patiala, was the first to call the British, In his territory. The later royal family became Congress, an Indian party, after the break up of Dynasty. 
Patiala State, was different from other Sikh States, as it did not support Sikh religion, and not following the Sikh rules. But still the State religion was Sikhism. The Later Patiala Maharajahs (Karam Singh) introduced Hindu Paintings of Hindu Gods within their Qila Mubarak palace in Patiala, it can still be seen, on the Palace Walls. Showing great respect to all religions. Rajput Hindu Paintings were very famous in Patiala from 1800s, The Maharajahs got them selves painted in Rajput Styles. And even had relations with the Royal Hindu States of Rajasthan.
They also had relationship with the Hindu Jat Rulers of Royal Bharatpur State in Rajasthan of Sinsinwar Clan. As Maharajah Narinder Singh, in 1859, married of his third daughter Maharani Bishan Kaur, to Rajah Jaswant Singh, (1851-1893), Jat ruler of Bharatpur State. Intermarriage between the Phulkian Jatts, and Rajasthani Royal Hindu Jatts, was very common, During the 19th Century.
Maharajah Yadavindra Singh, signed his union with India in 1948, transferring his Kingdom, to the Government of India, Patiala State was united with the Punjab State of India, in 1948. The Maharajah also told other Royal Princely States to Unite with India.

Artillery of Japan

Artillery in Japan is recorded in the 13th century. It was not used widely before the Sengoku period in the 16th century.
In the 1840s, the Tokugawa Shogunate began to anticipate that either British or French military might attack Japan. Takashima Shuhan (1798-1866) submitted a petition to the shogun calling for the purchase of Western firearms. In 1841, a demonstration of Western gunnery made a strong impression. Powerful factions in the shogunate resisted change.
During the 1864 Bombardment of Shimonoseki, European naval guns were shown to be superior to Japanese cannon on shore.
Following the Meiji Restoration, Japan would pursue a policy of "Rich country, strong army" (富国強兵), which led to a general rearmament.
The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) used artillery during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895).
Naval guns and field artillery were important in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905.
Before and during World War II, the Japanese Army deployed a variety of artillery pieces.
The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) developed large naval artillery pieces.

Starstreak (missile)

Starstreak is a British short range surface-to-air missile (also known as MANPADS). It is made by Thales Air Defence (first called Shorts Missile Systems), in Belfast. It is also known as Starstreak High Velocity Missile, or Starstreak HVM. After it is launched, the missile travels at about Mach 3 (3 times the speed of sound). Starstreak has been in service with the British Army since 1997.
Starstreak can be fired from a soldier's shoulder or from the Stormer armoured vehicle.
Starstreak can travel 1,500 metres minimum and 5,5000 metres maximum.
Starstreak began being developed in the early 1980s. This was after a study into a weapon that could add to the Rapier missile system. A General Staff Requirement (GSR 3979) was made. This GSR showed what the missile system needed to have. One of the things it needed to have was three ways to launch the missile. These were:
In 1984, the British Ministry of Defence gave contracts to British Aerospace (BAe) and Shorts Missile Systems to develop the missile. The BAe missile was called the Thunderbolt. Shorts won the competition. They were awarded £356 million. The weapon was developed more in November 1986. More contracts were also given out to make the missile. Starstreak was put into service officially in September 1997. Starstreak is supposed to replace the Javelin surface-to-air missile in British service.
The light weight launcher and the launcher which can be moved around by people have been in use since 2000.
In the middle of 2007, Thales UK in Northern Ireland said that it had developed Starstreak II. Starstreak II is an improved version of Starstreak. Some of these improvements were: a bigger range (7 km), a better system to find targets and the ability to find aircraft that are higher up in the air.
In 2011, when Thales won a contract for the Lightweight Multirole Missile, Thales said it agreed with the MOD to "re-role previously contracted budgets to facilitate the full-scale development, series production and introduction of the LMM." This means that Thales were going to focus all their money on the Lightweight Multirole Missile. The contract affected by this is said to have been Starstreak.
The Starstreak missile is moved around in a tube. This tube is sealed closed. The tube is attached to the main part of Starstreak to be fired. The gunner follows the target using Starstreak's special aiming system. When the gunner has locked on to the target, they press a button and the missile launches.
The missile then fires its first motor. This launches the missile from the tube. However, it stops burning before the missile leaves the tube. This is to protect the gunner. When the missile is away from the gunner, another motor fires. It makes the missile go to Mach 3.5. It stops burning when it is about four hundred meters away from the gunner. The back of the missile has the systems that guide the missile by laser beams from the launcher. The Starstreak launches many small darts at its target. Each dart has around of explosive in it.
When the darts hit the target, a fuze is triggered. This fuze delays the explosion. This gives time for the darts to get inside the target before the explosives go off. The explosive is inside a shell of tungsten. This tungsten is designed to split up and make as much damage as possible inside the target.
In September 1999, the missile was shown attacking an armoured personnel carrier. This showed that Starstreak could also be useful in attacking targets on the ground as well as in the air. 
In 2012, the Ministry of Defence said that it was going to put a group of Starstreaks on top of an apartment complex in London. This was because of the 2012 London Olympics. The Ministry said that the area was the only place to put an anti-aircraft battery. Some people living there were not happy. They wondered why the battery was needed.

AS-90

The AS-90 (Artillery System for the 1990s) is a lightly armoured self-propelled artillery gun. It is used by the British Army. It was first used in 1993. The AS-90's official name is Gun Equipment 155 mm L131.
The AS-90 is used by five regiments of the Royal Horse Artillery and Royal Artillery. 
AS-90 was designed and built by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering (VSEL, owned by BAE Systems since 1999). They made 179 AS-90s from 1992 to 1995. This cost £300 million. 
In 2002 BAE Systems were asked to give 96 British Army AS-90s a 52 calibre gun. This would make the range 30 km. With special shells, it would be able to reach 60 to 80 km. However, this project ended up being ended.
AS-90 started in the mid-1980s. It was made on a "gamble" that the SP70 would fail. When this happened, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) asked for a new vehiicle. Four designs were handed in, and AS-90 was the only one that the MoD liked. 
The MoD has tried to get the Royal Navy's main ship gun to be able to use the barrel and breech from the AS-90. This would make the gun calibre of the British Army and Royal Navy the same. This would help with ammunition logistics. This would also make it possible for the Army and Navy to help each other develop weapons.
The AS-90 has a special power unit. This is used so that the engine does not have to keep running. This is done to keep the batteries charged while the AS-90 is not moving.
The gun can be started up when it is fully closed down in less than one minute.
The AS-90 has a special computer called the Turret Control Computer (TCC). The TCC controls all main functions of the turret.
AS-90D - Changed for use in the desert. This model has more cooling for the engine and other machines.
AS-90 "Braveheart" - The AS-90 with the 52 calibre length gun. This project was cancelled.
Haubicoarmata "Krab" - (eng. "Howitzer-cannon Crab") A "Braveheart" turret on a Polish chassis. Designed in Poland by Huta Stalowa Wola and WB Electronics. , two Krab ("Crab") prototypes have been built.

Larry the Cable Guy

Daniel Lawrence "Larry" Whitney (born February 17, 1963) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, musician, voice artist, and comedian. He is best known by his stage name and character Larry the Cable Guy. 
He is one of the members of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. This is a group of comedians. The other members of the Tour are Bill Engvall, Ron White, and Jeff Foxworthy. 
Whitney has made seven comedy albums. Three of these have been listed as gold albums by the RIAA. He has been in three Blue Collar Comedy Tour movies. Whitney has also been in the movies "", "Delta Farce", and "Witless Protection". He is well known as the voice of Mater in the "Cars" movies. Whitney's catchphrase "Git-R-Done!" is also the name of his book.
On January 26, 2010, the television channel History said that it wanted to make a series with Whitney. It is called "Only in America with Larry the Cable Guy". In this series, Whitney would explore the United States. He would learn about different ways people lived. He would also learn about their jobs and hobbies. The first episode of the series aired on February 8, 2011.
A CMT bio says that Whitney grew up on a pig farm in Pawnee City, Nebraska. He went to college at the Baptist University of America. He says his roommates from Texas and Georgia helped him create his imitation Southern accent. He left college after his third year to be a comedian.
Whitney started his career in radio. He was a disc jockey in Blue Springs, Missouri. He became known in the early 1990s when he made regular radio appearances by telephone on many radio programs. These included programs in Omaha, Nebraska, Baltimore, Maryland, Kansas City, Missouri, Orlando, Florida, Portsmouth, New Hampshire and Manchester, New Hampshire
He became famous for creating the "Larry" character. It is a personality that he now uses for his entire stage act. The Larry character has a stereotypical redneck appearance and a thick Southern accent. He tells stories about his fictional "family". He is well known for his catchphrase "Git-R-Done!" A large part of Whitney's act is his accent. He says in interviews and in his autobiographical book "GIT-R-DONE" that he uses the accent both on and off stage. He does this because he may forget it if he kept his normal accent. He uses catchphrase humor, including "Git-R-Done," "Lord, I apologize, and me with the starvin' Pygmies down there in New Guinea. Amen." and "I don't care who ya are, that's funny right there" after certain jokes. 
His first two comedy albums, "Lord, I Apologize" (2001), and "The Right To Bare Arms" (2005), have both been certified gold by the RIAA. A third album, "Morning Constitutions" was released in 2007.
In 2006, Comedy Central asked Whitney to be the voice of character for an animated series they wanted to create. The series would use his character as one of two owners of a small cable channel. A half-hour pilot was made but not broadcast.
Whitney was roasted in a Comedy Central special on March 15, 2009. During the roast he can be heard talking to people using his normal voice.
On Tuesday, February 8, 2011 his series, "Only in America with Larry the Cable Guy", began being broadcast on the History Channel. 4.1 million viewers watched it.
Whitney lives in Lincoln, Nebraska. He married his wife Cara in 2005. They have two children together. They have a son, Wyatt (born August 2006), and a daughter, Reagan (born October 2007). In 2010, Whitney and his wife said that their son Wyatt has hip dysplasia. 
In the town where he grew up, Pawnee City, Nebraska, there is a street named after him. Whitney also gave money to buy new theatrical equipment for the high school.

Field gun

A field gun is an artillery piece. The term was first used to describe smaller guns that could be taken with an army while marching. In battle the field gun could be quickly moved about the battlefield as needed. Guns installed in a fort, siege cannon and mortars were too large to be moved quickly, and would be used only in a long siege.
Napoleon used field guns with very large wheels that allowed them to be moved quickly even during a battle. By moving the guns from place to place during the battle, formations of enemy soldiers could be broken up to be handled by the infantry wherever they were massing, dramatically increasing the overall effectiveness of the infantry.
As artillery developed technically, almost all guns of any size could be moved at some speed. Even the largest siege weapons could be moved by road or rail by the start of World War I. Development then turned towards smaller weapons with increased mobility. Even the World War II German super-heavy guns could be moved by rail or by caterpillar-track vehicles.
In British use, a "field gun" was anything up to 4.5 inches in calibre. Larger guns were called "medium" and the largest of all "heavy". Their largest gun (as opposed to howitzer) was the 5.5 inch (140 mm) Medium, which could fire a shell about 15,000\16,000 yards.
Since the start of World War II, the term field gun has been used for long-range artillery pieces that fire at a relatively low angle, as opposed to howitzers which can fire at higher angles. By the end of World War II most artillery in use were howitzers of 105 mm to 155 mm. The only common field guns still used were the British 5.5 inch and the US 155 mm Long Tom. The Long Tom had been developed from a French World War I weapon.
The US Army used long-range guns again in the 1960s with the M107 175 mm gun. The M107 was used in the Vietnam War and proved effective in artillery battles with the North Vietnamese forces. This gun needed a lot of repairs, and after the barrels began to crack it was removed from service. Production of the M107 continued through the 1980s, and the gun is still used by the Israeli military forces.
Today there is no longer a use for the field gun. The role for small and highly mobile artillery has been taken over by the mortar which can be carried by a soldier. These have replaced almost every artillery piece smaller than 105 mm. Gun-howitzers fill the middle ground, mostly the 155 mm NATO or 152 mm former USSR models. The need for a long-range weapon is filled by rocket artillery, or aircraft. Modern gun-artillery such as the L118 105mm light gun is used to provide fire support for infantry and armour at ranges where mortars are impractical. Soldier carried mortars lack the range or hitting power of gun-artillery. In between is the rifled towed mortar. This weapon (usually in 120mm calibre) is light enough to be towed by a Land Rover, has a range of over 6,000m and fires a bomb with the power of an artillery shell.

L118 Light Gun

The L118 Light Gun is a howitzer. It was first made for the British Army in the 1970s. It has been moved around the globe a lot since then. The United States use a changed version of the L118 called the M119A1. The proper name for it is "Gun, 105mm, Field, L118" but it is usually just called "the Light Gun".
The L118 can be towed by a medium-weight vehicle. It can also be moved around by a Chinook helicopter.
From 1961 until the 1970s, the British Army used the 105 mm Pack Howitzer L5 as its light howitzer. This howitzer was used a lot. It was first designed in Italy for the Alpini. It was light enough to be lifted by Westland Wessex helicopters or towed by Land Rovers. However, it could not fire very far (had a short range), had bad sights and was not very popular.
In 1965 the British Army asked for a new 105 mm howitzer because the pack howitzer "lacked range and lethality" (had a short range and was not very lethal). 
The new gun was soon called the 'Light Gun'. It was designed by the government Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment (RARDE). Prototypes were tested in 1968. However, it was noticed that more weight was needed for a gun to be as sturdy and strong as was needed. Several guns were redesigned because of this.
The first guns were made by Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Nottingham. This has now been merged into BAE Systems Land and Armaments.
The L118 was first used by the British Army in 1976. The new weapon was heavier than the Pack Howitzer. However, new, better helicopters like the Puma and Westland Sea King, which could carry the L118, were also beginning to be used at the same time.
Since the end of the 1990s, the British Army has used Pinzgauer ATVs as the vehicles that move the guns around. In Arctic service (and some other places) the L118 is moved around by the Hägglunds Bv 206. It has skis put on it if it is moving on snow.
In 1982, the L118 was used a lot during the Falklands War. 30 guns were moved to the Falkland Islands. Since then, British forces have used the L118 in the Balkans, Sierra Leone, Iraq and Afghanistan.
On 30 November 2001, an L118 Light Gun became the One O'Clock Gun in Edinburgh Castle. This fires every day at one o'clock except on Sundays, Good Friday and Christmas Day.
The Light Gun took many features from the QF 25 pounder. However, the L118 is light compared to the QD 25 pounder.
The L118 has a special system called the Automatic Pointing System. This allows the gun to be unpacked and in action in 30 seconds. 
The L118 fires 105 mm Fd Mk 2 ammunition. It has two proper cartridges for combat and a blank one for ceremonies etc. 
Some ammunition types in British service are:
WP (white phosphorus) smoke shell has never been used by the UK for the L118.
New ammunition for the L118 is being developed. It will be even more damaging and have more range.
During the early 1990s, all UK L118s had a radar and its supply of power.
A program that started making improvements to UK guns in 2007 tried to make the gun lighter and some features better. To make the gun weigh less, some steel parts were replaced with titanium.
The L119 has a different barrel. It is a bit shorter. It fires different ammunition, giving the gun a range of . In British service, the L119 was only used for training. The last British L119s were retired in 2005.
The L119 was changed more and made under a license for the United States Army.

List of field guns

Field guns are one of two main types of field artillery. Field guns fire a heavy shell on a relatively level trajectory from a longer barrel. This gives very high muzzle velocity and good range performance. Field guns are best for giving long range fire support and counter-battery fire. This list has two categories; field guns that were moved (towed) by horses or vehicles, and guns that could move themselves (self propelled) guns.

Blush or rouge is a type of cosmetic put on the cheeks, usually in red or pink. It can be a powder or a cream. Blush is almost always used by girls and not often used by boys except for in acting.
Blush was first used by Egyptians in 3000 BC. In the 1800s, wearing cosmetics made people think a woman had bad character, so people from that time would pinch their cheeks to make them red.

Battle of Nagashino

The was an armed conflict in 1575. The battle took place near Nagashino Castle (長篠城) on the plain of Shitaragahara (設楽原) in the Mikawa province (三河) of Japan. 
Forces under Takeda Katsuyori (武田勝頼) attacked the castle. The Takeda attacked the castle because it threatened supply lines.
Okudaira Sadamasa (奥平貞昌) commanded the 500 defenders of the castle. The defenders had 200 matchlocks and at least once cannon.
Both Tokugawa Ieyasu (徳川家康) and Oda Nobunaga (織田信長) sent troops to break the siege and their combined forces defeated the Takeda attack.
Nobunaga's use of firearms to defeat Takeda's cavalry is considered as a turning point in Japanese warfare. His tactical innovation was the wooden stockades and rotating volleys of fire which led to a decisive victory at Nagashino.
The Battle of Nagashino and the last years of the Takeda clan are dramatised in Akira Kurosawa's 1980 movie "Kagemusha" (Shadow Warrior).

Drag racing

Drag racing is a competition between specially prepared automobiles or motorcycles. Racers compete, two at a time, to be the first to cross a finish line. Races are run from a standing start, in a straight line, over a measured distance, usually a ¼-mile straight track.
The race track, known as a dragstrip, usually uses an electronic timing system to decide the winner.
Before each race, each driver is allowed to perform a burnout by spinning the driving tires. Burnouts heat the driving tires and lay rubber down at the beginning of the track to improve traction. The drivers then line up at the starting line.
Races are started electronically by a system known as a Christmas tree. 
Below the staging lights are three large amber lights, a green light, and a red light. When both drivers are staged, the tree is set to start the race causing the three large amber lights to illuminate, followed by the green light. If the front tires leave the starting line before the green light illuminates, the red light for that driver's lane illuminates instead. This indicates disqualification (unless a more serious violation occurs). Once a driver commits a red-light foul (also known as "redlighting"), the other driver can also commit a foul start by leaving the line too early but still win, having left later. Should both drivers leave after the green light illuminates, the one leaving first is said to have a "holeshot advantage".
The first vehicle to cross the finish line wins the race. The elapsed time is a measure of performance only; it does not determine the winner. Because elapsed time does not include reaction time and each lane is timed separately, a car with a slower elapsed time can actually win if that driver's holeshot advantage exceeds the elapsed time difference. This is known as a "holeshot win".
Several measurements are taken for each race: reaction time, elapsed time, and speed. Reaction time is the period from the lighting of the green light to the vehicle leaving the starting line. Elapsed time is the time from the vehicle leaving the starting line to crossing the finish line. Speed is measured through a speed trap covering the final to the finish line, indicating the approximate maximum speed of the vehicle during the run. 
In the standard racing format, the losing car and driver are removed from the contest and the winner goes on to race other winners. This continues until only one is left.
The National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) oversees most of drag racing events in North America. The next largest organization, Feld Entertainment's International Hot Rod Association (IHRA), is about one-third the size of NHRA. Nearly all drag strips are associated with one sanctioning body or the other. The NHRA is more popular with large, 1/4-mile, nationally recognized, tracks., The IHRA is a favorite of smaller 1/8-mile local tracks (and offers selected races on their national tour under the 1/8-mile format). One reason for this is the IHRA is less restrictive in its rules, such as rules on nitrous oxide (legal in Pro Modified) and oversized engines.

Dragstrip

A dragstrip is a facility for conducting automobile and motorcycle acceleration events such as drag racing. Although a quarter mile (402 m) is the best known measure for a drag track, many tracks are eighth mile (201 m) tracks. The race is begun from a standing start. Three factors decide the outcome of the race: reaction time, torque, and traction.
A dragstrip is a straight racetrack, usually an eighth or a quarter of a mile long (660/1320 feet, 201/402 metres), followed by a "shutdown area" to allow automobiles room to stop after crossing the finish line. Common features also include a 'water box' where cars and motorcycles start their burn-outs to clean and heat up their tires to improve traction. There is a set of lights known as a 'Christmas Tree' that counts down to the start. There are also return lanes for the vehicles to return from the end of the track to the pit area.

<doc id="327790" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=327790" title="Olympia (painting)">
Olympia (painting)

Olympia is an 1863 oil painting by Édouard Manet. When it was first exhibited in 1865, the subject of the painting was controversial. 
Manet reworked Giorgione's "The Sleeping Venus" (c. 1510) and Titian's "Venus of Urbino" (c. 1538) in creating "Olympia". "Olympia" may also take inspiration from Francisco Goya's "La maja desnuda" (c. 1800). This is uncertain however. Victorine Meurent was Manet's model for "Olympia". She posed as a bullfighter for him and also for the "Dejeuner sur l'Herbe" of 1862-63. Manet painted "Olympia" in the autumn of 1863. The work was first seen by the public at the 1865 Salon in Paris. Manet delayed showing the painting because he feared it might produce some negative reactions.
"Olympia" did produce negative reactions: people hated it. Some people thought the painting was immoral and vulgar. Critic Paul de Saint-Victor wrote in "La Presse", "People throng in front of Manet's putrid "Olympia" as they would in front of a body in the Morgue. This is art fallen so low that it is not even worthy of censure". Nathaniel Harris writes, "In reviewing "Olympia" Gautier wrote that the model was puny, the bed covered with cat's footprints, the general effect ugly: but then he made the point that "we would forgive the ugliness, were it only truthful ... The least beautiful woman has bones, muscles, skin, and some sort of colour", whereas on this woman the flesh colour was dirty and the modeling non-existent." Some liked the painting. Émile Zola said it was Manet's "masterpiece". He added, "When other artists correct nature by painting Venus they lie. Manet asked himself why he should lie. Why not tell the truth?" In 1866 Zola wrote with tongue-in-cheek, "If only Manet had borrowed a powder puff ... and had lightly powdered Olympia's cheeks and her breasts she would have been a bit more presentable".
Modern art historian Nathaniel Harris writes, "..."Olympia" was an erotic shock ... Manet presented a young woman with erotic modern trappings ... that served to emphasize her nakedness ... To add to the puzzlement of the ordinary man, Olympia's gaze was not in the least inviting, or provocative, or even enigmatic ... it was simply neutral ... [N]eutrality ... was one more affront to the 19th-century male, whose picture-women were supposed to yield, to comply ... Here the girl is cool and confident, and it is the setting and properties that suggest sexualityperhaps a commercialized sexuality that is none too reassuring to the male ego."

Little Dancer of Fourteen Years

Little Dancer of Fourteen Years () (1881) is a statue by Edgar Degas. The work measures 81 inches in height. The subject is a young dance student named Marie van Goethem. The relationship between van Goethem and Degas is uncertain. It was not unusual for the young dancers of the Paris Opera to seek protectors from among the well-heeled visitors at the back door of the opera.
The statue was shown in Paris at the Sixth Impressionist Exhibition of 1881. It received mixed reviews. Most critics were shocked by the piece. They thought it was ugly. Degas exhibited it inside a glass case. Some thought it was a medical specimen. The head and face were thought grotesque and primitive.
The dancer is dressed in a cotton skirt and is wearing a hair ribbon. For a finishing touch Degas used a wig made of real hair. He covered it with wax. The only parts not covered with wax were the ribbon given to him by van Goethem and the tutu. Each museum that shows this figure gives it a different tutu. The original wax model was acquired by Paul Mellon in 1956.
The sculpture was originally made in wax before it was cast in bronze. Degas's wife and daughter made the decision to have 27 of them cast in bronze. The casting was undertaken at the Hébrard foundry in Paris from 1920 until the mid-20th century. These statues posthumous Degas bronzes can be seen in many museums. Sixty-nine original sculptures in wax and mixed-media survived the casting process.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art describes the painting: "Wearing an elegant Worth gown, Marguérite Charpentier sits beside her three-year-old son, Paul. Following the fashion of the time, his hair has not yet been cut and his clothes match those of his sister, Georgette, who perches on the family dog.

Hermes and the Infant Dionysos

Hermes and the Infant Dionysos is a statue possibly made by the ancient Greek sculptor Praxiteles. The statue was discovered in 1877 in the ruins of the Temple of Hera at Olympia, Greece. It is now in the Archaeological Museum of Olympia. The statue was probably made in the 4th century BC. This date is based on a remark by the 2nd century Greek traveller Pausanias.
Hermes stands 2.15 meters (7 ft. ½ in.) tall. He is missing two fingers of his left hand, both forearms below the elbow, the left foot, and his penis. Dionysos is missing his arms (except the right hand on Hermes' shoulder). He is missing the end of his right foot. Much of the tree trunk and the plinth are also lost. However, an ancient base survives, made of a grey limestone block between two blocks of marble.
The group is sculpted from a block of Parian marble. Hermes measures 2.10/2.12 meters, 3.70 m with the base. The right foot of Hermes is integral with a section of the base. The face and torso of Hermes are striking for their highly polished, glowing surface. The back shows the marks of the rasp and chisel. The rest of the sculpture is not completely finished. At the time of its discovery, the hair had some slight traces of cinnabar, a form of mercury sulfate with a red color that may have been a preparation for gilding. Cinnabar tints are seen on the sandal straps of the original foot, with traces of gilding. The sandal also bears the motif of a Heraclean knot.

Crelle's Journal, or just Crelle, is a journal that was published monthly for mathematical articles. It was founded by August Leopold Crelle in 1826 in Berlin. The full German title is Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik (in English: "Journal for Pure and Applied Mathematics").
Crelle edited the journal until his death in 1855. Lots of very important mathematical articles were published in it. Some of these were articles which had a very big influence on the development of mathematics. It published famous articles by mathematicians such as Niels Henrik Abel, Georg Cantor, and Gotthold Eisenstein.

The Alvis Stormer, usually just called the Stormer, was a British armoured vehicle. It was in service with the British Army until mid-2009, when the Stormers were gradually retired. 
It was made by the British company Alvis Vickers. Alvis Vickers is now called BAE Systems Global Combat Systems.
There are three different kinds of Stormer. These are:
The British Army use Stormers with the Starstreak missile for short range air defence.
A different kind of Stormer with a flat load bed is used to carry the Shielder minelaying system.
Stormer 30 is a changed Stormer chassis which gives a tracked reconnaissance vehicle. This type has a turret. 
The vehicle is still only a prototype. It is unknown when it will enter service. The vehicle will be able to be moved around by the C-130 Hercules used by the RAF aircraft as well as the CH-53, which is currently in service with NATO and other nations across the world.

Skip

Skip (written as $kip) is a singer-songwriter and pop artist. He is known for his single entitled "Skippin'" which is a part from his self-titled debut album. The song was a hit in the Philippines, certified gold.
At the age of 10, $kip performed for live audiences and clubs where people gave him credits for his act. People also rated him performances. One comment lead him to join a local competition and sang "Benny And The Jets", but didn't he win. Two days after the competition, a call from his old record label offered him to get signed. In 2011, he rejected his label and was forced to move to another one.
A week after releasing his first single, the song directly charted in the Philippines where it peaked in the top 8 for 2 straight weeks. The single was then a certified Gold. According to PARI (Philippine Association of the Record Industry), the single's certification was supposed to be higher, but all agreed that the single can only make it to Gold.
Skip has said that his debut album will be released some time in December 2012. In February 2012, he performed his second single from the album, titled "Clap! Clap! Clap!". The song directly debuted on the Philippine Charts and there it peaked on number 10.

Nitrocellulose

Nitrocellulose (also: cellulose nitrate, flash paper) catches fire quickly. It is formed by nitrating cellulose through exposure to nitric acid or another powerful nitrating agent. When used as a propellant or low-order explosive, it is also known as guncotton. Nitrocellulose can be plasticized by camphor. Kodak, and other suppliers, used placticized nitrocellulose as a film base in photograph, X-ray films and motion picture films. People call this "nitrate film". After numerous fires caused by unstable nitrate films, safety film started to be used from the 1930s in the case of X-ray stock and from 1948 for motion picture film.

<doc id="327887" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=327887" title="Big Bertha">
Big Bertha

Big Bertha is the name of a type of super-heavy howitzer made by the famous armaments manufacturer Krupp in Germany on the eve of World War I. Another huge gun, 42-cm Gamma-Device howitzer, was the forerunner of the Bertha.
Bertha's official name was the L/12 (the barrel was 12 calibre in length), or the M-Device.
Many sources say that "Bertha" is a reference to Bertha Krupp, heiress and owner of the Krupp industrial empire. However, not all accept this. During the war, the Germans gave numerous other nicknames to the M-Device. 'Dicke', meaning fat or big in German, is apparently not a reference to the physical aspect of Ms Krupp. 
The name "Big Bertha" subsequently came to be applied generally by the Allies to any very large German gun. This included the railway guns which used mounted battleship guns known as "Langer Max" and the ultra-long range "Paris Gun". Strictly speaking, however, Dicke Bertha, or Big Bertha, is "only" applicable to the 42-cm M-Device howitzer.
Bertha was the result of lessons learned by the Germans (and Austrians) from the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05. During the war, the Japanese had dismounted a number of their coastal defence 28-cm howitzers and used them to help break their siege of the fortified Russian naval base at Port Arthur. 
This was a complete novelty as, until that time, it had been assumed by military experts that the largest transportable siege guns were around 20-cm in calibre. Other Europeans completely failed to draw the lessons the Japanese had taught, and went forward withough any huge siege guns.
Big Bertha gained a strong reputation on both sides of the lines due to its early impressive successes in smashing the forts at Liege, Belgium. The German press went wild with enthusiasm and declared the Bertha a 'wonder weapon'. When used later during the German assault upon Verdun in February 1916, however, it proved less effective, as the fort, made of concrete reinforced with steel, could mostly withstand the large semi-armour-piercing shells of the Berthas. Only Fort Vaux was severely damaged during this event, destroying the water storage and leading to the surrender of the fort.
A total of 12 complete M-Devices were built; besides the two available when the war started, ten more were built during the war. This figure does not include additional barrels. 
As the war ground on several Berthas were destroyed when their barrels burst due to faulty ammunition. Later in the Great War, an L/30 30.5-cm barrel was developed and fitted to a number of Bertha carriages in order to provide longer-range, though not quite as heavy fire.

Sun, Moon, and Talia

"Sun, Moon, and Talia" () is a fairy tale by Giambattista Basile. It was published in his "Pentamerone" (1636). It is similar to the "Sleeping Beauty" tales by Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm. 
A great lord consults several wise men about the future of his newborn daughter Talia. They predict she will be put in danger from a splinter of flax. To protect his daughter, the father commands that no flax be brought into his house. Years later, Talia sees an old woman spinning flax on a spindle. She asks if she may try it. As soon as she begins to spin, a splinter of flax goes under her fingernail. She drops to the ground, and appears dead. Her father puts Talia in one of his country houses and abandons her.
Some time later, a king, hunting in the nearby woods, follows his falcon into the house. He finds Talia, and tries unsuccessfully to wake her up. He rapes her and returns to his own city. 
Still deep in sleep, Talia gives birth to twins (a boy and a girl). They are tended by fairies. One day, the boy begins to suck on Talia's finger and draws out the flax splinter. Talia awakens immediately. She names them "Sun" and "Moon" and lives with them in the house. The king returns and finds Talia is the mother of twins. He tells her what happened and they form a bond.
However, the king is married. His wife is suspicious and learns the truth. She gains possession of the two children. She orders the cook to prepapre them for consumption. The cook spares the childen and sends the queen a dish of lamb. The queen taunts the king while he eats. The queen has Talia brought to court. She commands that a huge fire be lit in the courtyard, and that Talia be thrown into the flames. Talia undresses and screams with grief. The king hears Talia's screams. He commands that his wife be thrown into the fire instead. The king and Talia marry.

<doc id="327912" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=327912" title="Mortar (weapon)">
Mortar (weapon)

A mortar is an artillery weapon which fires explosive shells. The shells are known as (mortar) bombs. They are fired at targets which are close, as mortars do not have long range. It has a short barrel which fires the mortar bomb at a low speed high into the air to reach its target. They have been used since medieval times. Mortars are made in different sizes, from large and heavy mortars to infantry mortars which can be carried by just one soldier. They are called an indirect fire weapon because the bomb drops onto the target from above, rather than being aimed straight at it. Soldiers firing a mortar do not need to be able to see their target.
A mortar is quite simple and easy to use. Mortars used today are made up of a tube that a gunner drops a bomb into. The tube is usually set at between 45 and 90 degrees angle to the ground. The higher the angle, the shorter the range. When the bomb reaches the bottom of the tube it hits a firing pin. The mortar bomb's weight is enough to set off the firing pin which ignites the round and fires it. Some larger mortars have a firing pin that is set off by using a string instead of automatically.
From the 18th to the early 20th century, very heavy siege mortars were used. These were very difficult to move around. These had up to one metre calibre. They were often made of cast iron. Smaller designs that were easier to move around were brought in during the First World War. Mortars are still used today.
Light and medium mortars are easy to move around. They are usually used by infantry units. Mortars can fire from a trench or defilade. 
Heavy mortars are usually between 120- and 300-mm calibre. These weapons are usually towed or put on to vehicles. They are sometimes loaded from the back (breech-loaded). They are usually used by infantry in battalions or divisions. Even mortars this large are simpler and cheaper than howitzers and field guns.
A mortar can be moved around by one or more people (bigger mortars can usually be broken down into parts) or moved around in a vehicle. An infantry mortar can usually be set up and fired from a mortar-carrier. A mortar-carrier is a changed armoured vehicle or one built especially to be a mortar-carrier. They have a big hatch on the roof. Mortars with two barrels—like the AMOS PT1—are the latest kinds of heavy mortar. They are put on things like armoured personnel carriers, tank chassis and patrol boats. 
Light versions of mortar are usually used by at least two men. Heavier mortars are fired by three to five men. Lighter mortars can be fired from anywhere that gives a good firing position. However, medium mortars usually fired from prepared, well fortified positions.
Most mortars used today are made up of a barrel, a plate for the barrel to stand on, and a bipod.
Mortars are mainly medium calibre weapons. However, mortars both bigger and smaller than this have been made. An example of a smaller mortar is the British 51 mm Light Mortar. The 51 mm is carried by just one soldier. It is made up of only a tube and a base plate. A bigger example is the Soviet 2S4 M1975 "Tyulpan" (tulip flower) 240 mm self-propelled mortar. 
Mortars are not very stable if they are used on snow or soft ground. This is because the recoil pushes them into the ground. The Raschen Bag can be used to avoid this problem.
The ammunition fired by mortars are properly called "bombs". One possible reason for this is that the fins that stabilise the round when it is flying, and the shape of the round makes it look like a bomb dropped from aircraft.
Mortars can fire many different bombs. Some of these are:
Mortars are usually smaller and lighter than howitzers and field guns. When the mortar bomb is launched, it comes down at a very steep angle (almost straight down). 
Mortars can be very helpful if they are used in hidden places. It can be even more helpful if there are people around the battlefield that help tell the mortar where to fire (forward observers).
Mortars have existed for hundreds of years. They were first used in sieges. A European description of the Siege of Belgrade (1456) by Giovanni da Tagliacozzo says that the Ottoman Turks used seven mortars that fired "stone shots one Italian mile high". The speed of these was said to be very slow. It was also said that men could be prevented from being injured by putting observers out who warned the troops of what angle the mortars were firing at.
Early mortars like the Pumhart von Steyr were big and heavy. They were also difficult to move around. An early mortar that could be moved around easily was invented by Baron Menno van Coehoorn (Siege of Grave, 1673). At the Siege of Vicksburg, General US Grant reported making mortars "by taking logs of the toughest wood that could be found, boring them out for six or twelve-pound shells and binding them with strong iron bands. These answered as cochorns, and shells were successfully thrown from them into the trenches of the enemy."
Mortars were very useful in the muddy trenches of the Western Front. A mortar round could be aimed to fall straight into a trench because of the deep angle that the bombs fell at. 
During the Battle of Iwo Jima, the Imperial Japanese Army used twelve 320 mm mortars against the American forces.
The biggest mortars ever made were the French "Monster Mortar" (36 French inches; 975 mm; developed by Henri-Joseph Paixhans in 1832), Mallet's Mortar (36 inches; 910 mm; designed by Robert Mallet and tested by the Woolwich Arsenal, London, in 1857) and the "Little David" (36 inches; 914.4 mm; developed in the United States for use in World War II). All three mortars had a caliber of 36 "inches". However, only the "Monster Mortar" was used (at the Battle of Antwerp in 1832).
"Home-made" mortars have been used by insurgent groups. They are usually used to attack well defended military bases or to scare civilians. An early example was the Davidka. This was used during the Israeli War of Independence in 1948. The Provisional Irish Republican Army used some of the best-known examples during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The biggest types came to be known as "barracks busters". They were usually made of heavy steel piping put onto a steel frame. 
Well-known events using "home-made" mortars include the 1985 Newry mortar attack. This was when nine members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary were killed. Another well-known event is the Downing Street mortar attack in 1991. In this, the IRA mortared 10 Downing Street during a meeting. Three bombs were launched but only one exploded. It landed in the back garden of the British Prime Minister's house. It only broke the windows at the back of the house. Prime Minister John Major had to move to Admiralty House while the windows were being fixed.

Type 38 75 mm field gun

The was a field gun used by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA). It became a standard field gun of the IJA after the end of the Russo-Japanese War.
Japan had experience with artillery in its war with Russia in 1904-05.
In 1905 ("Meiji 38"), the Imperial Japanese Army selected Krupp's artillery design. At first, the field guns were imported.
Over 2000 guns were produced under license at the Army’s Osaka Arsenal.
After World War I, the weapon was re-designed in Japan.
Plans to replace the Type 38s with Type 90 75 mm field guns went forward in 1931. However, Type 38s continued to be used.
Type 38s were used in the Second Sino-Japanese War and in World War II.

Bombard (weapon)

A bombard is a large-caliber, muzzle-loading, medieval cannon or mortar. It was used in sieges for throwing heavy stone balls. The name bombarde was used in a French historical text around 1380. The modern term "bombardment" comes from this.
Bombards were usually used during sieges to hurl various things into enemy forts. Items such as stone or metal balls, burning materials and weighted cloth soaked in quicklime or Greek fire are have been written about.
The name comes from medieval Latin and French words from an earlier Greek word meaning the making of a humming noise.
A famous example of a bombard is Mons Meg, a large weapon built around 1449 and used by King James II of Scotland. It was very powerful and used for bringing down castle walls. Mons Meg could fire shots and was one of the largest bombards in its time. It is now on public display at Edinburgh Castle. Other known bombards include two wrought iron weapons, the Pumhart von Steyr and Dulle Griet. There were also weapons cast in bronze, the Faule Mette, Faule Grete, and Grose Bochse. The Tsar Cannon is a late 16th century show-piece.
The Dardanelles Gun was built in the Ottoman Empire in 1464 by Munir Ali. It weighed 18.6 t and was 518cm long. It could fire stone balls of up to 63cm diameter.
Bombards were replaced by weapons using smaller calibre iron shells with more powerful gunpowder.

Bombardment

A bombardment is an attack by artillery weapons against fortifications, troops or towns and buildings. It word came from the name of the medieval artillery weapon, the bombard, which was used to fire heavy stones during a siege.
Before World War I the word bombardment was only used for the attack of defenceless or undefended objects, houses, public buildings. Since then it has come to mean any mass attack delivered by artillery or short range missiles, and also as aerial bombardment if delivered by bomber aircraft or long range missiles.
It now is also used to describe activities in science, such as firing high energy particles like electrons into atoms in the study of nuclear reactions. The word can also be used informally, for example, a person could be "bombarded" with questions.
In its old strict sense the term was only applied to the bombardment of defenceless or undefended objects, houses, public buildings. The purpose is to destroy the courage of your enemies. Civilians in a besieged town would put pressure on their military leaders to surrender before the place was destroyed. The practice of using artillery to do this was especially common up until World War I. Since then long range artillery bombardment has been joined by aerial bombardment delivered by aircraft and missiles.

<doc id="327928" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=327928" title="Rapier (missile)">
Rapier (missile)

Rapier is a British surface-to-air missile. It was developed for the British Army and Royal Air Force. It began being used in 1971 and eventually replaced all other anti-aircraft weapons in the British Army. It replaced both guns for targets that were flying low down, and the English Electric Thunderbird which was used against targets that were higher up and further away. 
Rapier defends against fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, unmanned aircraft and cruise missiles. It is also able to fire two missiles at once.
Rapier can be moved around by ground and air.
Rapier started being developed in 1961. It was done privately at the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC). Then, the missile was known as "Sightline". The project was to fight supersonic, low-flying aircrat. 
At the time the British Army was going to buy the American MIM-46 Mauler for air-defense. Mauler ran into problems in 1963, so the Ministry of Defence started giving money to Sightline. Sightline was supposed to be a backup in case Mauler failed. This eventually happened, and Sightline was eventually developed as "Rapier". The missile was 1966 for testing. Full versions of Rapier were tested in 1968. A contract was given in 1969 for the missile to begin being made. Rapier began being used in 1971 with the British Army, and 1974 with the Royal Air Force Regiment.
The first Rapier was a launcher on wheels. It had four missiles. The launcher is a large cylinder. It has two missiles on each side. 
The first Rapier was accurate and simple to use. However, it could not be used in all types of weather. To fix this, BAC started working on a different radar unit. This led to the Marconi DN 181 "Blindfire" radar in 1970. The first Blindfires were sold to the Iranian Army in 1973. The British Army did not buy the Blindfire system until 1979.
It soon became noticed that a version of Rapier that could be moved around was needed. BAC decided to change Rapier to fit onto the M548, a version of the M113 armored personnel carrier. In 1974, this weapon was developed as "Tracked Rapier". The vehicles were bought by the British Army. The first Tracked Rapiers were used with "11 (Sphinx) Air Defence Battery", of 22 Air Defence Regiment, Royal Artillery in 1982-83.
Moving to firing takes only 30 seconds. This was a very big improvement to Towed Rapier. The biggest difference between towed and tracked Rapier was that the tracked Rapier launcher has eight missiles. The towed Rapier only has four.
There was no room for Blindfire on a single M548. Because of this, it is towed or put onto a different M548. 
After Tracked Rapier entered service, it was upgraded many times to follow the upgrades being made to all Rapiers. 
Tracked Rapier has been replaced by Starstreak missile launchers. These are put onto the Alvis Stormer.
The "Field Standard B" (FSB) added some basic upgrades to Rapier. Also, the radar which searches for enemy aircrat was upgraded so that it could be easily shut down.
Because of all the new upgrades, the first, cheap Rapier was gone. To make Rapier cheaper, BAC began developing the "Rapier Laserfire" in 1982. 
Tracking and firing is similar to the first Rapier. However, the Laserfire lights up the target and automatically tracks it with a powerful YAG:Nd laser. 
In 1988, a better missile started being tested. This missile exploded before it hit the target. This allowed Rapier to hit smaller, faster targets.
In 1992 the Army decided to upgrade Rapier to higher-quality versions.
The missile has two versions, the Mk. 2A to shoot down aircraft, and the Mk. 2B, which can be used against light tanks and other armoured vehicles.
In April 1982, the first Rapier was used during the Falklands War. Early reports about Rapier were good. They said Rapier got 14 kills and probably killed another 6 more. However, later reports said that around four enemy aircraft were shot down by Rapier. Only one Argentine aircraft, a Dagger A, was definitely a Rapier kill. The pilot was killed. 
"Within the total only five Argentine aircraft might have been shot down by Rapier, and, as originally noted by Ethell and Price, only one of these was certain, with two probables and two possibles. Similar discrepancies arose over other weapons systems, notably Blowpipe (one confirmed kill as against nine confirmed and two probables in the White Paper) and Sea Cat (zero to one against eight confirmed and two probables in the White Paper). […] This confirmation that MoD had exaggerated, however unwittingly, the capabilities of Rapier was deemed to be political dynamite. It was observed that if this assessment became publicly known it 'could have a serious adverse effects on sales' prospects for Rapier, which is the staple revenue-earner for BAe's Dynamic Group."
The main problems were that Rapier could not fire very far, and that there was no proximity fuse. This meant that the gunner had to hit the aircrat with the missile directly. There were also problems with Rapier's IFF system.
It has been announced the UK Ministry of Defence was giving money to a company to find a replacement for Rapier. The Common Anti-Air Modular Missile (CAMM) would have some components the same as the ASRAAM missile which is in service with the RAF.
An example of Rapier can be seen in a hangar in IWM Duxford.

Railway gun

A railway gun, also called a railroad gun, is a large artillery weapon, built on, transported by, and fired from a specially designed railway wagon. Many countries have built railway guns, but the best known were made by Krupp and used by Germany in World War I and World War II. Smaller guns were often part of an armoured train.
Railway guns are no longer used. Their large size and limited movement made them easy targets. They have been replaced by aircraft, rockets, and missiles.
The idea of railway guns was first suggested in the 1860s by a Mr Anderson. He published a pamphlet in the United Kingdom titled "National Defence" in which he proposed a plan of ironclad railway carriages. A Russian, Lebedew, claimed to have first invented the idea in 1860 when he is reported to have mounted a mortar on a railway car.
The first railway gun used in battle was a banded 32-pounder Brooke naval rifle. In the American Civil War it was mounted on a flat rail car and protected with sheets of iron. On 29 June 1862, Robert E. Lee had the gun pushed by a locomotive over the Richmond and York River line (later part of the Southern Railway) and used at the Battle of Savage's Station. There is also a photo of a Union 13-inch siege mortar mounted on a rail car during the Siege of Petersburg, Virginia. It was nicknamed the "Dictator" or the "Petersburg Express".
Railway guns were used by France during the Siege of Paris in 1870, and by the British during the Siege of Ladysmith during the Second Boer War.
The start of the First World War caught the French with a shortage of heavy field artillery. Large coastal defense guns and naval guns were moved to the front. These were usually unsuitable for field use and needed some kind of mounting. The railway gun was an obvious solution. By 1916, both sides were usuing railway guns.
Baldwin Locomotive Works made five 14"/50 caliber railway guns on trains for the United States Navy during April and May 1918. Each train carried a Mk 4 14"/50 caliber gun. These were a naval rifle used on New Mexico and Tennessee class battleships, mounted on a rail carriage with four 6-wheel bogies. One of these guns is on display outside the museum at the Washington Navy Yard.
The Second World War saw the final use of railway guns. The Germans used the massive Schwerer Gustav gun, the largest artillery piece to be used in battle. The rise of the aeroplane effectively ended the use of the railway guns. Like battleships, they were big, expensive, and easily destroyed from the air.

Ion cannon

In science fiction, an ion cannon is a beam weapon. It shoots beams of ions (atoms or molecules with an electrical charge). Because of its power, it is usually said to be a superweapon. An ion cannon is a type of particle cannon. The particles is shoots are ionized. Because of their electrical charges, they can cause electronic devices, vehicles, and anything else that has an electrical or similar power source to stop working. Ion cannons are used in many science-fiction movies and television series. Ion cannons are also used in many video games. 
The science fiction idea for these weapons comes from the particle cannon created by Nikola Tesla. Tesla's cannon shot ions into the ionosphere. This caused them to be charged more. Research of this idea is still being done with directed-energy weapons.

Mortier de 12 Gribeauval

The Mortier de 12 pouces Gribeauval (Gribeauval 12-inch mortar) was a French mortar. It was made using the Gribeauval system developed by Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval. It was part of the siege artillery. The measurement of the mortar is given by the diameter of the ball. It is measured using the French ancient system of measurement, in which 1 pouce (1 inch) is equal to 2.707 cm. The Gribeauval system was a new way of making artillery as a single piece of metal and then drilling a bore hole. This meant they could be made much lighter and more accurate.
The Mortier de 12 pouces Gribeauval was first used during the American Revolutionary War from 1780-82. It was used during the Siege of Yorktown in 1781. It was later used in by the French army during the wars that followed the French Revolution and during the Napoleonic Wars.
The Mortier de 12 pouces used a cylindrical chamber. Although this was quite efficient, it used to wear easily. This shape was later replaced by the Gomer system using a conical chamber.
Some of the Mortier de 12 pouces were used for coastal defense, in which case they were fixed on solid metal platforms.

Doubochinski's pendulum

Doubochinski's pendulum is an experiment with an oscillator and a magnet. The most simple case is that of a pendulum that interacts with an oscillator. The pendulum (with a magnet at the end) will swing at a frequency of one swing per period of 1-2 seconds. A stationary electromagnet is placed under the equilibrium point of the pendulum. The electromagnet is then supplied with an alternating current of a fixed frequency, of between 10 and 10.000 Hz. 
When the pendulum is released at any location, its movement will then evolve to stop at a height which depends on the frequency of the current of the electromagnet. This phenomenon was first discovered by the brothers Danil and Yakov Doubochinski in 1968–69.

Mons Meg

Mons Meg is a mediaeval bombard made in 1449. It is now at Edinburgh Castle, Scotland. In contrast to modern shells, which are explosive, these older cannons fired solid balls. Mons Meg fired balls of iron.
It seems, from the accounts of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, that it was made to his order around 1449 and sent as a gift eight years later to King James II of Scotland, with other artillery supplies. Mons Meg weighs , is in length, and has a calibre of . The final cost of the gun was £1,536. 2s.
The bombard was made from long bars of iron, hooped with rings and fused into one mass. The Duke's artillery maker constructed it, and it was tested at Mons, Wallonia, in June 1449. The Duke did not take delivery until 1453. The Duke decided to help the Scots against the English, and sent it to James II. James imported a lot of artillery from continental Europe during his reign. He used it against his enemies in Scotland, such as the Earl of Douglas. James died as a result of an exploding cannon used in the siege of Roxburgh Castle in 1460.
Another story suggests Mons Meg was made in order to help James II in the 1452 siege of Threave Castle in Kirkcudbright, when the Clan MacLellan used it to batter the castle. This version has little support.
The calibre cannon accepted balls that weighed about . It could only be fired 8-10 times a day due to the tremendous heat generated by the huge powder charge. In early years the gun, like the other royal cannon, was painted with red-lead to keep it from rusting. This cost 30 shillings in June 1539. 
From the 1540s Meg was retired from active service and was fired only on ceremonial occasions from Edinburgh Castle, from where shot could be found up to two miles away. When Mons was fired on 3 July 1558, workmen were paid to find and retrieve the shot from Wardie Mure, near the River Forth. The salute marked the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots to the French Dauphin.
The gun was fired in 1680 to celebrate the arrival of James, Duke of Albany and York, later King James II of England and VII of Scotland. The barrel burst. An English cannoneer had loaded the charge and many Scots believed that the damage was done on purpose, since the English had no cannon as big as this. The incident was also seen as a bad omen for the future King.
The cannon was left outside Foog's Gate at Edinburgh Castle. It was next taken, with other disused ordnance, to the Tower of London in 1754, but was returned to the Castle in 1829, after a campaign by the author Sir Walter Scott. It was restored, and now sits outside St. Margaret's Chapel.

Schwerer Gustav (English: "Heavy Gustaf, or Great Gustaf") and Dora were the names of two huge World War II German 80 cm K (E) railway siege guns. 
The two guns were developed in the late 1930s by Krupp, the famous German arms manufacturer. Their purpose was to destroy heavy fortifications, especially in the French Maginot Line. The guns weighed nearly 1,350 tonnes, and could fire shells weighing seven tonnes to a range of .
Although they were intended for World War II, they were not ready for action when the Wehrmacht outflanked the Maginot line by sweeping through the low country (Belgium) to start the Battle of France. However, they were ready in Autumn 1941, after the Wehrmacht invaded the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa). Gustav was used at the siege of Sevastopol in the summer of 1942. By the end of the siege on 4 July the city of Sevastopol lay in ruins, and 30,000 tons of artillery ammunition had been fired. Gustav had fired 48 rounds and worn out its original barrel, which had already fired around 250 rounds during testing and development. The gun was fitted with the spare barrel and the original was sent back to Krupp's factory in Essen for relining.
Both Gustav and Dora were moved to Leningrad, and may have been intended for Warsaw. Gustav was eventually captured by US troops and cut up, whilst Dora was destroyed near the end of the war to avoid capture by the Red Army.
The Schwerer Gustav was the largest calibre rifled weapon in the history of artillery to see actual combat. It fired the heaviest shells of any artillery piece. A few other huge guns were never fired in anger: the French "Monster Mortar" (36 French inches; 975mm), the British Mallet's Mortar (36 inch; 914 mm) and the American Little David mortar (36 inch; 910 mm).

Dominion of Newfoundland

The Dominion of Newfoundland was a British Dominion from 1907 to 1949. It was in northeastern North America along the Atlantic coast. It was made up of the island of Newfoundland and Labrador on the mainland. 
The territory was a British colony until 1907, when it was made a dominion. The Statute of Westminster of 11 December 1931 said that the Dominion of Newfoundland was independent within the British Commonwealth, along with Canada, Ireland, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. But on 16 February 1934 the Newfoundland parliament gave up its self-government, and governance of the dominion went back to being controlled from London. Though governed from overseas, Newfoundland stayed legally a dominion, until it joined Canada in 1949 to become Canada's tenth province.

Type 95 75 mm field gun

The was a field gun of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA). It was used during World War II. 
This artillery piece was planned to replace the Type 38 75 mm field gun and the Type 41 75 mm cavalry gun in front line combat. However, Type 38s continued to be used.
Before World War I, the Imperial Japanese Army mainly had Krupp cannons from Germany. After the Versailles Treaty, the Japanese considered other options including field guns designed by Schneider et Cie from France. 
In 1931, IJA began to use the "Type 90" which was based on Schneider designs; however, the Type 90 was not considered successful.
The Type 95s were simpler and more sturdy than the Type 90s.
Type 95s were used in the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Hamitic

Hamitic theory is a theory that claims that so called "hamitic" race is superior to the negroid races on the African continent. John Hanning Speke started the theory. Karl Richard Lepsius and Carl Meinhof extended the theory: they used languages to classify people into hamitic or non-hamitic; this is no longer done today. 
Another way they classified people into hamitic or non-hamitic is by ethnic roots. For example, a person who has ancestry from Rome would be considered closer to a Hamite than a person who's ancestry is in Africa. 
This theory also included giving classes to those members of the negroid races of Africa upon colonization. This, in part, contributed to the Rwandan Genocide, which pinned the members of the Tutsi ethnicity or tribe against the members of the Hutu people, although the tension between them was over small differences.

Vices &amp; Virtues

Vices & Virtues is the third full-length studio album from Panic! at the Disco. It was released on March 18, 2011 under Fueled By Ramen and Decaydance Records. The album was produced and mixed by music engineers Butch Walker and John Feldmann. The album peaked at number seven on the "Billboard" 200 albums chart and number five on the Billboard Digital Albums chart. The lead single off the album, "The Ballad of Mona Lisa", was released on February 1, 2011. The single peaked at number 84 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. The second single off the album, titled "Ready to Go (Get Me Out of My Mind)", was released on June 6, 2011. It peaked at number 14 on the "Billboard" Alternative Songs chart. 
The album has a different sound than their previous two studio album releases "A Fever You Can't Sweat Out" (2005) and "Pretty. Odd." (2008). That is because two group members had left, and because of the amount of time between the releases of "Vices" and "Pretty. Odd." The album has elements from the band's debut album. It has heavy use of synthesizers and guitars. The track "Mona Lisa" returns to the idea of the band's first single "I Write Sins, Not Tragedies", which had heavier guitar and rock influences. 
The song "Let's Kill Tonight" was released in the United Kingdom for the band's 2012 "Spring Vices & Virtues Tour". A music video was uploaded on February 10, 2012 on the Fueled By Ramen official YouTube channel with a minute and ten seconds of the band performing the song live in London. 
"Vices & Virtues" was released March 22, 2011 in the United States, Brazil, and Canada. It was released on other dates in other countries. The record debuted at number seven on the US "Billboard" 200 albums chart, with first-week sales of 56,000 copies in the United States. This is very different from the group's previous effort, "Pretty. Odd.", which debuted without much commercial attention in 2008, with first-week sales of 139,000. The album also came in at #2 on Neilson SoundScan Alternative Albums chart and #5 on the Digital Albums ranking.

<doc id="328052" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=328052" title="Infantry gun">
Infantry gun

Infantry guns are artillery weapons for the use of infantry units. The designs usually have short barrels which fire a low speed shell. They are lightly built so they are easy to moved around on the battlefield. Very few infantry guns are still used by infantry units. They have been replaced by grenade launchers, light anti-tank weapons and heavier wire-guided missiles. Pack guns are similar to an infantry gun, but mean those guns that are meant to be taken apart for movement. Mountain guns are infantry guns designed for use during mountain combat. Airborne guns are those designed for use by paratroopers. They are easy to move and lighter weight when compared to field guns.
Infantry guns were the first type of artillery used by armed forces, first in China, and later brought to Europe by the Mongol invasion. At first they were simple cast barrels called "pots de fer" in French, or "vasi" in Italian. These weapons were small, immobile, and fired large bolts or quarrels. As the barrels became longer, a way had to be found to move the guns. This led to two different solutions. One was the very light hand-gun, which became the arquebus. The other was to place the gun on wheeled carriages, such as the 2-pounder Culvern moyane, the 1-pounder Falcon, and the 3/4-pounder Falconet. These lighter Renaissance pieces led to the development of the 3-pounder and 4-pounder regimental guns of the 17th century, notably in the army of Gustavus Adolphus. The light field guns of the 17th century, known as a "drake" in England, came in almost 100 different calibres. Each had its own name, some of which were:
The saker and falcon had ranges of 360 and 320 yards if fired straight at the target, and 2,170 and 1,920 yards if fired in an upward arc.
Although oxen were used to pull the heavier field and siege guns, some on wagons rather than limbers, they were too slow to keep up with the infantr. Horses were used to pull the lighter pieces, leading to the development of the artillery carriage and horse team that survived until the late 19th century.

<doc id="328053" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=328053" title="L'elisir d'amore">
L'elisir d'amore

L'elisir d'amore () is an Italian comic opera in two acts. The music was written by Gaetano Donizetti. Felice Romani wrote the libretto, after Eugène Scribe's libretto for Daniel Auber's "Le philtre" (1831). 
The opera was first performed at the Teatro della Canobbiana, Milan, Italy on May 12, 1832. "L'elisir d'amore" is number 12 on the Operabase list of the most performed operas in the world. The aria "Una furtiva lagrima" () is very famous. In 1840, Richard Wagner arranged the opera for piano. W. S. Gilbert wrote a parody of the opera called "Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack" in 1866.
Nemorino, a poor peasant, is in love with Adina, a beautiful landowner. She torments him with her seeming indifference. When Nemorino hears Adina reading to her workers the story of Tristan and Isolde, he considers using a magic potion to gain Adina's love. He is afraid she loves Sergeant Belcore. The Sergeant appears with his regiment. He proposes marriage to Adina. The traveling quack salesman, Dulcamara arrives, selling his bottled cure-all to the townspeople. Nemorino asks Dulcamara if he has anything like Isolde's love potion. Dulcamara says he does. He sells it to Nemorino at a price matching the contents of Nemorino's pockets. The bottle contains only wine. In order to make a timely escape, Dulcamara tells Nemorino the potion will not take effect until the next day. Nemorino drinks it, feeling its effects immediately. 
Emboldened by the 'elixir' Nemorino encounters Adina. She teases him mercilessly, the audience senses that the attraction might be mutual, were it not for the marriage proposal of the Sergeant Belcore. In fact, their wedding date has been set for six days hence. Nemorino's confidence that tomorrow he will win Adina by virtue of the elixir, causes him to act indifferently toward her. This upsets Adina, but she attempts to hide her feelings. Instead, she ups the ante as well by agreeing to Sergeant Belcore's alternate suggestion: that they marry immediately as he has just received orders that the regiment must ship off the next morning. Both Adina and the Sergeant gauge Nemorino's reaction to this news, the Sergeant with resentment, Adina with despair. Nemorino panics, and cries out for Doctor Dulcamara to come to his aid.
Adina's outdoor wedding party is in full swing. Dr. Dulcamara is there, and performs a song with Adina to entertain the guests. The notary arrives to make the marriage official. Adina is sad to see that Nemorino has not appeared. Everyone goes inside to sign the wedding contract. But Dulcamara stays outside, helping himself to food and drink. Nemorino appears, having seen the notary, realizes that he has lost Adina. He sees the Doctor and frantically begs him for more elixir, of the type that will work immediately. But because Nemorino has no money, the Doctor refuses, disappearing inside. The Sergeant emerges, alone, wondering aloud why Adina has suddenly put off the wedding and the signing of the contract. Nemorino spots his rival, but is powerless to do anything. The Sergeant asks about Nemorino's dejection. When Nemorino says he has no money Belcore immediately suggests that if he joins the army he'll be paid immediately. He produces a contract, which Nemorino signs (with an X) in return for the cash Belcore gives him on the spot. Nemorino privately vows to fly to Dulcamara for more potion, while Belcore muses that he has easily dispatched of his rival by sending him off to war.
Later that evening the women of the village are gossiping that Nemorino is unaware that he has just inherited a large fortune from his deceased uncle. They spot Nemorino, who has clearly spent his military signing bonus, and has bought and consumed a large amount of 'elixir' (wine again) from Dr. Dulcamara. The women approach Nemorino with overly friendly greetings, the likes of which he has never seen. This is proof to Nemorino that this dose of the elixir has worked. Adina sees Nemorino in a jolly mood and, encountering Dr. Dulcamara, wonders what has gotten into him. Dulcamara, unaware that Adina is the object of Nemorino's affection, tells her the story of the smitten bumpkin who spent his last penny on the elixir, and even signed his life away, joining the army for money to get more, so desperate was he to win the love of some unnamed cruel beauty. Adina immediately realizes Nemorino's sincerity, and regrets teasing him. She falls for Nemorino, basking in the sincerity of his love. Dulcamara interprets this behavior as some sort of condition requiring a cure by one of his potions.
They depart. Nemorino appears alone, pensive, reflecting on a tear he saw in Adina's eye when he was ignoring her earlier. Based on that tear alone, he is sincerely convinced that Adina loves him. She enters, asking him why he has chosen to join the army and leave the town. When Nemorino says he's seeking a better life, Adina responds by telling him he is loved, and that she has purchased his military contract from Sergeant Belcore. She offers the cancelled contract to Nemorino, asking him to take it. He is free now. She says, however, that if he stays, he will no longer be sad. As he takes the contract Adina turns to leave. Nemorino believes she is abandoning him and flies in to a desperate fit, vowing that if he is not loved, if the elixir has not worked, and the Doctor has fooled him, then he might as well go off and die a soldier. Adina stops him and confesses that she loves him. Nemorino is ecstatic. Adina begs him to forgive her for teasing him. He does so with a kiss. The sergeant returns, seeing the two in an embrace. Adina explains that she loves Nemorino. The Sergeant takes the news in stride, noting that there are plenty of other women in the world. Dulcamara, his bags packed, pops out of a doorway, adding that he will happily provide elixir for the Sergeant's next conquest. A crowd has gathered by now, all agreeing that the elixir has done its job as they bid a fond farewell to the doctor.

The Orion nebula, or Messier 42, M42, or NGC 1976, is a diffuse nebula. It is one of the brightest nebulae, and is visible to the naked eye in the night sky. M42 is at a distance of 1,344 ± 20 light years. It is the closest region of massive star formation to Earth. 
It is south of the Orion's Belt in the constellation of Orion.
Big as it is, the Orion nebula is just part of an even larger star-forming area known as the Orion complex.
The nebula is a huge stellar nursery. 700 stars are in the process of forming there. At its heart is a very young open cluster, known as the "Trapezium" because of the pattern formed by its main stars. 
Recent observations with the Hubble Space Telescope have shown protoplanetary disks inside the Orion Nebula. This is a major discovery. They are called "proplyds" for short. There are more than 150 of these in the nebula. They are thought to be to be systems in the earliest stages of planetary system formation. The sheer numbers have been used as evidence that the formation of star systems is fairly common in the universe.
Stars form when clumps of hydrogen and other gases in an H II region contract under their own gravity. As the gas collapses, the central clump grows stronger and the gas heats to extreme temperatures by converting gravitational potential energy to thermal energy. If the temperature gets high enough, nuclear fusion will start, and form a protostar. The protostar is 'born' when it begins to emit enough energy to balance out its gravity and halt gravitational collapse.

La fille du regiment

The Daughter of the Regiment () is a comic opera in two acts. The French libretto was written by Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges and Jean-François Bayard. The music was composed by Gaetano Donizetti. The opera is famous for the tenor aria "Ah! mes amis, quel jour de fête!" It features nine high Cs. The opera was first performed on 11 February 1840 by the Paris Opéra-Comique at the Salle de la Bourse. It was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in 1902/03. The role of Marie was a favorite with Jenny Lind.
The Marquise of Berkenfeld and her butler, Hortensius, are on their way to Austria. They pause in their journey because a skirmish has broken out. The Marquise learns that the French troops have retreated. She comments on the rude manners of the French people ("Pour une femme de mon nom"). The sergeant of the 21st regiment, Sulpice, assures everyone that his men will restore peace and order. He is joined by Marie, the "daughter" of the regiment. She is an orphan and was adopted by the soldiers. Sulpice questions her about a young man she has been seen with. She explains that he is Tonio, a Tyrolean who once saved her life. Troops of the 21st arrive with a prisoner. It is Tonio. He has been looking for Marie. She steps in to save him. He toasts his new friends, and Marie sings the regimental song (""Chacun le sait"). Tonio is ordered to follow the soldiers. He escapes and returns to declare his love to Marie. Sulpice surprises them. Marie must admit to Tonio that she can marry only a soldier of the 21st.
The Marquise asks Sulpice for an escort to her castle. When Sulpice hears the name Berkenfeld, he remembers a letter he found near the young Marie on the battlefield. The Marquise soon admits that she knew the girl's father. She says that Marie is the long-lost daughter of her sister. The child had been left in the care of the Marquise, but was lost. She is shocked by the girl's rough manners. She decides to take her niece to her castle and give her a proper education. Tonio has enlisted so that he can marry Marie ("Ah, mes amis"). But Marie has to leave both her regiment and the man she loves ("Il faut partir").
The Marquise has arranged a marriage between Marie and the Duke of Krakenthorp. At the Marquise's castle, Sulpice is recovering from an injury. He is supposed to be helping the Marquise with her plans. The Marquise gives Marie a singing lesson. Marie slips in phrases of the regimental song with Sulpice's encouragemment. The Marquise loses her temper (Trio: "Le jour naissait dans la bocage").
Marie is left alone. She thinks money and position are meaningless ("Par le rang et l'opulence"). She hears soldiers marching in the distance. She is delighted when the whole regiment files into the room. She leads them in singing a patriotic tribute ("Salut à la France"). Marie is reunited with Tonio. Tonio asks for Marie's hand in marriage. The Marquise is unmoved by the young man's declaration that Marie is his whole life ("Pour me rapprocher de Marie""). She says her niece is engaged to another man. She dismisses Tonio. The Marquise and Sulpice are left alon. She confesses the truth: Marie is her illegitimate daughter. She abandoned Marie long ago, fearing social disgrace.
Hortensius announces the arrival of the wedding party. It is led by the groom's mother, the Duchess of Krakenthorp. Marie refuses to leave her room. Sulpice tells her that the Marquise is her mother. The surprised girl says she cannot go against her mother's wishes. She agrees to marry a man that she does not love. She is about to sign the marriage contract when the soldiers of the 21st, led by Tonio, storm in to rescue their "daughter". The guests are horrified to learn that Marie was a canteen girl. They change their opinion when she tells them that she can never repay the debt she owes the soldiers. The Marquise is so moved by her daughter's goodness of heart that she gives her permission to marry Tonio. Everyone joins in a final "Salut à la France".

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) people in Israel are considered to have more rights than anywhere else in the Middle East. In November 2005, a groundbreaking (which has not happened before) court decision in Israel ruled that a lesbian spouse could officially adopt a child born to her current partner by artificial insemination from an anonymous sperm donor; this ruling came despite protests by the minority Orthodox Jewish parliamentary parties. Common law marriage which grants most of the official marriage rights to the spouse has been achieved, but full official same-sex marriage has not yet been sanctioned. However, same-sex marriages performed elsewhere are recognized.

LGBT rights in Palestine

In the Palestinian territories, there are no laws that specifically protect LGBT people. No laws protect LGBT people from discrimination (not being treated equally because they are LGBT) or harassment. However, the Basic Law of the Palestinian Constitution does give all Palestinians certain freedoms. For example, it covers freedom of belief, freedom of expression, and freedom of bodily integrity. It also gives Palestinians freedom from discrimination "because of race, sex, color, religion, political views, or disability". The Basic Law also protects people's human rights. In other countries, people have used these types of laws and freedoms to argue that LGBT rights should exist. However, hundreds of gay Palestinians have left and moved to Israel because they did not feel welcome or safe in Palestinian-ruled areas.
Homosexuality has not been decriminalized in all of Palestine. (This means that homosexuality is still illegal in parts of Palestine.) In 1951, same-sex acts were decriminalized in the West Bank, which was ruled by Jordan. Same-sex acts are still decriminalized there today. On the other hand, in the Gaza Strip, same-sex acts between men were made illegal in 1936, by the British Mandate Criminal Code Ordinance, No. 74. This law is still in place, so same-sex acts between men are still illegal there. Lesbian women are not covered by this law. i am gay and i wanna grab a machete and slash females. 
In both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Authority has not made laws either for or against homosexuality. Instead, the President of the Palestinian Authority decided to keep the laws that were already in place in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. On May 20, 1994, he ruled that laws that took effect before June 5, 1967 in these areas would not be changed. The laws are also more complicated because the Palestinian territories have been ruled by many different foreign powers, like the Ottoman Empire, the British Empire, Jordan, Egypt, and Israel. Each of these foreign powers created their own laws for the Palestinian territories. Because of the many different laws that have been in place there, the legal situation in the territories is confusing. Sometimes, the criminal law about homosexuality is applied (or used) in the territories. At other times, the laws are not applied. Is can be different in the different territories.

These wars involved huge numbers of soldiers owing into applications of modern mass conscription. The wars are divided between First Coalition (1792 to 1797) and the Second (1798 to 1801), although France was under war with Great Britain constantly from 1793 until 1802.

Raoul Wallenberg

Raoul Wallenberg (1912 – 1947?) was a Swedish businessman and diplomat. He helped save about 100,000 Hungarian Jews from being killed by the Nazis in 1944, during the Holocaust in World War II. He often risked his life, and later won worldwide admiration for his heroic efforts.
Wallenberg was born in Kapptsta, near Stockholm. He was a member of a prominent family of bankers and industrialists. He visited Hungary on business in the early 1940s, during World War II. Wallenberg became increasingly disturbed by the plans of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler to kill all the Jews of Europe. In 1944, the World Jewish Congress and the American War Refugee Board asked Wallennberg to help and he agreed to go to Hungary to save the remaining Jews there.
The Swedish government sent Wallenberg to serve as a diplomat in Budapest, Hungary's capital. He gave Swedish passports to about 20,000 Jews, allowing them to ask for the protection of the neutral Swedish government. He also protected Jews in houses he bought or rented with his own money or money from the groups that had sent him. Wallenberg, a Lutheran, was assisted by Roman Catholic and other non-Jewish leaders.
Adolf Eichmann, a Nazi official who directed the sending of Jews to concentration camps, ordered Wallenberg to stop interfering with German plans for the Jews. Wallenberg said no. Eichmann tried to have Wallenberg killed, but he was not killed. In the final days before the liberation of Budapest by Soviet soldiers, Wallenberg persuaded the Nazis to stop a plan to kill 70,000 Jews who were forced to live in a ghetto (separated part) of the city. 
In January 1945, Soviet forces arrested Wallenberg. They apparently believed he was an American spy. In 1957, the Soviet government reported that Wallenberg had died of a heart attack in prison in 1947. But several people said that they saw him alive in Soviet prisons and hospitals after 1947. 
In 1981, the United States Congress made Wallenberg an honorary U.S. citizen.

<doc id="328190" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=328190" title="Bernhard Riemann">
Bernhard Riemann

Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann (b. 17 September 1826 near Hanover; died 20 July 1866 Selasca, Italy) was a German mathematician. He had a short life and did not write down very much about his discoveries, but the things he discovered were all extremely important and had a revolutionary effect on mathematics. He contributed to many fields of mathematics, such as analysis, geometry, mathematical physics and number theory. Today, many people see him as a great mathematician. He was among the first to introduce complex analysis. The kind of geometry he started (which is called Riemannian geometry today) is one of the bases of the Theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein.
Bernhard Riemann was the second child in a family of six children. His father was a Lutheran pastor. The family was very poor and did not have much to eat. Several of the children died, and Bernhard always had poor health. His parents were loving, but he was a very shy boy. Later in life he had to try very hard to be brave enough to speak in public. His father was one of his first teachers. The young boy was very keen to learn about everything. When he was ten he had a specialist maths teacher, but he was often better at maths than his teacher. When he was 14 he went to Hanover where he lived with his grandmother so that he could go to a Gymnasium school. His father wanted him to be a priest, but Bernhard was much too shy to preach to people. In the end he let him study maths.
There is a well-known story from Riemann’s school days. The school director excused him from maths lessons because the lessons were much too easy for him. Bernhard asked the director whether he could borrow a difficult maths book to read, so the director lent him "Théorie des Nombres" (Theory of Numbers) by Legendre. This was a huge book with maths that was so difficult that only a few people in the world would have understood it all. The director was disappointed when the boy brought the book back after only six days. He asked him how far he had got. The boy said he had read the whole book. This was true, and he had understood and remembered it all. Later in life, when Riemann was 33, he developed the famous Riemann hypothesis. This was an article that was only 8 pages long, but he developed his idea from what Legrange had written. Mathematicians ever since have struggled to try to prove what Riemann wrote.
Riemann studied at the universities of Göttingen and Berlin. During his student days he was developing ideas that were to become very important to modern mathematical physics. In 1851 he got his doctorate for a dissertation called "Foundations for a General Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable". This was to become very useful in topology which deals with position and place. When he became lecturer at Göttingen he had to offer three lectures from which the professors would choose one. One of the professors was Carl Friedrich Gauss who was one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived. Gauss asked him to talk about "On the Hypotheses that form the foundations of Geometry". Gauss himself had worked on this subject. Riemann was terribly nervous about lecturing on this subject in front of the famous Gauss. When he gave the lecture, it became one of the most famous events in the history of mathematics. Gauss did not often give praise to younger mathematicians, but he was very enthusiastic. Riemann’s ideas made it possible for Einstein to develop his theory of relativity more than half a century later.
At first Riemann had no salary. He depended on fees from the students. After four years he was given a small salary. In 1857 he became associate professor and in 1859 full professor, succeeding Dirichlet who had succeeded Gauss four years earlier. Riemann suffered from bad health. Overwork often resulted in periods of depression. There were many deaths in his family, but he worked very hard and made several discoveries that are now named after him. He was becoming very famous. On a visit to Berlin Borchardt, Kummer, Kronecker and Weierstraß - all very famous mathematicians - showered him with praise. He went to Paris where he met Hermite who greatly admired him. He was honoured by the Royal Society of London and the French Academy of Sciences.
He married and for a short time he was happy. Then he became ill. He suffered from pleurisy and made several visits to Italy for his health. He died in Selasca on Lago Maggiore aged 39.

H.M.S. Pinafore

H.M.S. Pinafore, or The Lass That Loved a Sailor is a two-act operetta by Gilbert and Sullivan. It is the fourth of their fourteen operettas. It premiered on 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique in London, England. It had 571 performances. The operetta became an international success, and had great influence on the development of musical theatre in Britain and America.
The H.M.S. "Pinafore" lies at anchor off Portsmouth. Little Buttercup comes on board to sell things to the sailors. She says that she has a secret. Ralph Rackstraw says he loves Josephine. The Captain worries that his daughter will decline Sir Joseph's marriage proposal. She tells her father that she loves a sailor in his crew, but assures him that she will never reveal her love to him.
Sir Joseph comes on board with his sisters, cousins, and aunts. He says he rose from humble beginnings to be "the ruler of the Queen's Navee", although he has no qualifications. He then delivers a lesson in etiquette, telling the Captain that he must always say "if you please" after giving an order for "A British sailor is any man's equal". He has composed a song to illustrate that point. 
Ralph is delighted with Sir Joseph's views on equality. He decides to declare his love to Josephine. Dick Deadeye points out that "when people have to obey other people's orders, equality's out of the question". Ralph is left alone on deck. Josephine enters, and Ralph confesses his love. She rejects his love and leaves. Ralph decides on suicide. He puts a pistol to his head. Josephine returns to say she loves him. They make plans to leave that night to marry. Dick Deadeye warns them against such a scheme. The joyous ship's company ignores him.
Later that night, Captain Corcoran tells Buttercup that he would have returned her love long ago if they were not so far apart in social class. She warns him that a change is in store for him. Sir Joseph complains that Josephine has not yet agreed to marry him. The Captain thinks she is probably dazzled by his "exalted rank". He suggests that Sir Joseph persuade her that "love levels all ranks". If he does so, Josephine will surely accept his proposal. Sir Joseph makes his argument to Josephine, but it only serves to strengthen her determination to marry Ralph. 
Dick Deadeye tells the Captain of the lovers' plans to elope. The Captain confronts Ralph and Josephine as they try to leave the ship. The pair declare their love. The furious Captain swears. Sir Joseph has heard this oath and is shocked. He orders the Captain confined to his cabin. Sir Joseph asks what provoked the Captain's outburst. Ralph replies that it was his declaration of love for Josephine. Sir Joseph is furious. He has Ralph taken to the ship's dungeon. 
Little Buttercup now reveals her secret. Many years ago, she had cared for two babies. One baby was of low birth, but the other was a wellborn babe. She "mixed those children up"  the wellborn babe is Ralph and the Captain is the babe of low condition. Sir Joseph realises that Ralph should have been the Captain, and the Captain should have been Ralph. He calls for both, and they enter wearing one another's uniforms. Sir Joseph's marriage with Josephine is now out of the question. He hands her to Ralph. Corcoran will marry Buttercup. Sir Joseph will marry Hebe. There is general rejoicing.
"Pinafore" had great influence on the development of musical theatre. According to theatre historian John Kenrick, "Pinafore" was an international sensation and reshaped the commercial theater in both England and the United States. Historian John Bush Jones writes that "Pinafore" and the other [Gilbert and Sullivan] operas show that musical theatre can provide amusement yet address current issues and events. He writes that "Pinafore" was the first musical to bring together story, song words, and music into a balanced whole. He adds that the show's popularity produced an American audience for musical theatre, and that the show has served as a model of the musical ever since.

The Sagrada Família (full name ) is a large Roman Catholic church in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It was designed by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926).
Although not finished, the church is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In November 2010 it was consecrated (dedicated to a special purpose) and made a minor basilica by Pope Benedict XVI. 
Building of the Sagrada Família began in 1882. Gaudí started working on it in 1883. He took over the project, and changed it with his ideas on architecture and engineering.
Gaudí worked on it until he died. At the time of his death in 1926, less than a quarter of the building was finished. The Sagrada Família's building was slow. It needed private donations (people giving money to it). It was stopped by the Spanish Civil War—only to start again in the 1950s. Building was more than halfway done after 2010. Some of the project's biggest problems still remain. There is an expected finish date of 2026–100 years after Gaudí's death.

<doc id="328374" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=328374" title="Tauriel">
Tauriel

Tauriel is a fictional character from Peter Jackson's three-part feature movie adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit". The character does not appear in the original book by writer J.R.R. Tolkien, but was created by Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh for two of the movies. Tauriel is a Woodland Elf, and is the leader of the Elven guard. Her name means "Daughter of Mirkwood" in the Elvish language. She is played by actress Evangeline Lilly, who appeared as Kate Austen on the TV show "Lost".
Tauriel first appears in the second part of the trilogy, "The Desolation of Smaug", which was released December 13, 2013. Before it was decided to have three films instead of two, Tauriel was described as having a more important role in what was then the final film, " Battle of the Five Armies", which was originally going to be released in 2013. However, when the filmmakers decided to make the series into a trilogy, that part of the story became the third part of the trilogy, which would be released in December 2014.
In "The Desolation of Smaug", the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, and thirteen dwarves, are traveling to Lonely Mountain, and pass through the black forest of Mirkwood, where they are captured by giant spiders. The spiders are then attacked by the Wood Elves, led by Legolas and Tauriel. Tauriel saves Kíli by killing a spider that was attacking him, but the Elves take the dwarves as prisoners for trespassing on their land. During the dwarves' imprisonment, Tauriel forms a bond with Kíli. It is later mentioned that Tauriel is a talented warrior and for this reason, was made leader of the Mirkwood border guards. Legolas, the son of Mirkwood's Elven king Thranduil, is shown to be attracted to her, and she used to be attracted to him too, but because she is a lowly Silvan Elf, she does not believe herself worthy of him, and similarly, Thranduil does not consider her to be a proper match for his son.
As the dwarves escape with Bilbo's help, the Elves' home is attacked by orcs. Tauriel again uses her skills to save Kíli, but Kíli is struck in the leg with an orc's arrow. This arrow is poisoned, and the wound it created will slowly kill Kíli. Thranduil learns that an evil entity has returned and is amassing great power in the south, and seals off his kingdom, but before he does this, Tauriel goes after the dwarves by herself. Legolas follows, and tries to convince her to return, but when she refuses, saying that the Elves are part of Middle Earth and that they must fight in the upcoming war, Legolas joins her pursuit.
After getting weapons and supplies at Laketown, the dwarves leave for the Lonely Mountain, but leave Kíli behind because of his injury, and Fili, Bofur and Oin stay behind to be with him. By the time Tauriel and Legolas reach Laketown, the dwarves are being attacked by orcs. They defeat the invaders, and Tauriel uses her knowledge of herbs to heal Kíli's wound, saving his life once again, after which they admit that they have developed a bond with one another.
In 1937 J. R. R. Tolkien published the fantasy novel "The Hobbit", which is about a group of 15 people: a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, a wizard named Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. This group goes searching for a treasure guarded by the dragon, Smaug. During the story, the group are captured by the Silvan Elves. During the Battle of Five Armies at the end of the story, the group of 15 travelers join with the Elves to fight an army of goblins and wargs.
Although Tauriel does not appear in this story, she was created by Peter Jackson and his wife and producing partner Fran Walsh for the movie. They did this in order to expand the world of the elves of Mirkwood Forest, and to bring another female to the cast, since it is mostly males. The character is a Silvan Elf, which means she is of a much lower place in Elf society than the elves that had been seen in "The Lord of the Rings" film series, like Arwen, Galadriel, Elrond, and Legolas. A Woodland Elf, her name has been translated as "Daughter of Mirkwood".
In June 2011 Peter Jackson announced that actress Evangeline Lilly, who played Kate Austen in the ABC drama "Lost", was cast in the role. Lilly, had been a fan of Tolkien's books since she was 13, but was nervous about how Tolkien fans would react to a character that did not appear in Tolkien's books. She stated that creating the character for the adaptation was the right thing to do, saying, "I believe she is authentic, because Tolkien refers to The Woodland Elves, he just doesn't talk about who they are specifically… [Peter and Fran] know that world so well. They’re not going to create a character that is not true to Tolkien's world." Despite this, some fans were unhappy with the creation of her character after the first trailer for the film was released on June 12, 2013. 
As head of the Elven guard, Lilly says that Tauriel is "slightly reckless and totally ruthless and doesn't hesitate to kill." Lilly also says Tauriel is a nonconformist (someone who refuses to follow established customs), and that because of her relative youth among Elves, she can be reckless in the decisions she makes, tending to rebel against the established social order of the Elves. Lilly explains, "She's only 600 years old, she's just a baby. So she's a bit more impulsive, and she's a bit more immature. I think she's more easily romanticized by a lot of things." However, she also has a "softer side", and her character's story has her falling in love with another character. Although she and Legolas are close, childhood friends, the romance is not with him. According to Lilly, Legolas' father, the Elven king Thranduil, is fond of Tauriel, and "sees something very special in her". Lilly told the filmmakers that she would only play the character if they promised that her character would not be part of a love triangle. However, when she was called back into production to shoot new scenes after it was decided to split the story into three films instead of two, she was told that a love triangle would indeed be added to the story.
To look like Tauriel in the films, she wore a red wig with knee-length hair, fake ears that are three times larger than the ones Orlando Bloom wore as Legolas (though Lilly felt that the long hair would take attention away from the ears). Instead of wearing the complex formal gowns that female Elf noblewomen were seen wearing in previous films, Tauriel wears Elven military garb, which is better-suited to her job as a border guard and soldier. The is an expert in a variety of weapons, but she usually uses a bow and two daggers, the same weapons Legolas uses. Lilly had a stunt coach help her film the action scenes. Although Lilly asked to do the character's wirework herself, because she had experience doing her own stunts on "Lost", that work was performed by a stunt double. Lilly also had a language coach teacher her how to speak the Elvish language. 
Filming of Tauriel's scenes began in September 2011 in New Zealand, and was expected to last a year. Lilly said that she enjoyed the calm atmosphere of the set, and the familiar experience of filming with a cast of mostly men, which reminded her of working on "Lost" and "The Hurt Locker". However, she said that the experience of having had her first baby in May 2011 made some parts of filming the fighting scenes harder than she expected, saying, "Recovering from labor is like recovering from a full-body injury, and I didn't realize to what extent that was true until I started training for elf fighting.

Battle of Plataea

The Battle of Plataea was the final land battle during the second Persian invasion of Greece. It was a decisive victory for the Greeks as it ended that war. The battle was in 479 BC near the city of Plataea in Boeotia. It was fought between the Greek allies (the city-states, of Sparta, Athens, Corinth and Megara), and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I.
The previous year, the Persian invasion force, led by the Xerxes in person, won the Battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium, and conquered Thessaly, Boeotia and Attica. However, at the last-ditch naval Battle of Salamis, the Allied Greek navy had won a surprise victory, and that stopped the conquest of the whole Peloponnesus. Xerxes then returned home with some of his army, leaving his general Mardonius to finish off the Greeks the next year.
In the summer of 479 BC, the Greeks got together a huge army by the standards of the day, and marched out of the Peloponnesus. The Persians retreated to Boeotia, and built a fortified camp near Plataea. The Greeks refused to be drawn into the open cavalry ground near the Persian camp, and this led to a stalemate which lasted eleven days. When their supply lines were disrupted, the Greeks retreated a distance, and their battle-line fragmented. Mardoniu thought the Greeks were in full retreat, and ordered his men to pursue them. The Greeks (particularly the Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians) turned and gave battle, routing the lightly armed Persian infantry and killing Mardonius.
Much of the Persian army was caught in their camp, and slaughtered. The destruction of this army, and the remnants of the Persian navy, allegedly on the same day at the Battle of Mycale, ended the invasion. After Plataea and Mycale, the Greek allies would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Plataea was in every sense a decisive victory, it does not seem (even at the time) to have been as famous as the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon or even the Allied defeat at Thermopylae.
A bronze column in the shape of intertwined snakes (the Serpent column) was created from melted-down Persian weapons, and was erected at Delphi. It commemorated all the Greek city-states that had participated in the battle, listing them on the column, and thus confirming some of Herodotus's claims. Most of it still survives in the Hippodrome of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), where it was carried by Constantine the Great during the founding of his city on the Greek colony of Byzantium.

GRB 970228

GRB 970228 was a gamma-ray burst (GRB). It was the first GRB which had an afterglow. It was seen on 28 February 1997. Since 1993, scientists had predicted GRBs to be followed by afterglows. But, until this event, GRBs had only been seen in very bright bursts of high-energy gamma rays.
The burst had several peaks in its light curve. It lasted around 80 seconds. The light curve was not normal. This suggested that a supernova may have happened as well. GRB 970228 happened in the same place as a galaxy about 8.1 billion light-years away. This means that GRBs happen outside the Milky Way.
Reichart showed that the light curve of GRB 970228 could only have been caused by a supernova. Definitive evidence linking gamma-ray bursts and supernovae was eventually found in the spectrum of GRB 020813, and the afterglow of GRB 030329. However, supernova-like features only become apparent in the weeks following a burst, leaving the possibility that very early luminosity variations could be explained by dust echoes.

Homologous chromosome

Homologous chromosomes are the pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism. They are the chromosomes which pair during meiosis.
With the exception of the sex chromosomes, each pair has the gene loci in the same positions on each chromosome, and the centromere in the same position. They are not genetically identical because they will usually have different alleles (versions of a gene) at some of the loci.
The most important fact is that homologous chromosomes physically pair for meiosis, the cell division which produces the gametes. During this pairing, crossing over takes place between chromatids of each pair. This exchange of alleles means the offspring are not identical to each other, or to either parent. In other words, the process increases the genetic variation in the population.
Sex chromosomes only pair along those parts where there is similar genetic material (loci) on both members of the pair.

She was made a member of the Academy of Fine Arts of Saint Petersburg. 
Vigée Le Brun returned to France during the reign of Emperor Napoleon I. Her relationship with the new regime was not completely harmonious. After all, she was a royalist and the former portraitist of Marie Antoinette. She visited England and painted British notables including Lord Byron. In 1807 she traveled to Switzerland where she was made an honorary member of the Société pour l'Avancement des Beaux-Arts of Geneva. She published her memoirs in 1835 and 1837.

Chinese folk religion

Chinese folk religion is a religion that has been practiced in China, and in areas inhabited by Chinese people. It is difficult to make a clear distinction between Chinese folk religion and other beliefs, because Chinese folk religion has elements of veneration of the dead, local spirits, clan spirits and traditional Eastern religions, such as Taoism, Confucianism, but also superstition, geomancy and Feng shui. There is no standarized mythology or clergy: rites are often performed by the father of a family. Since the 1950s, the term Shenism is sometimes used to refer to Chinese folk religion.(pinyin: "Shénjiào", 神教), In this context, shen refers to a spirit or a deity. The term Shenism was first used by A. J. A Elliot in 1955. The term Chinese folk religion is not used inside China.
Sometimes it is classified with Taoism: Over the centuries, Taoism became institutionalised. During that time it tried to use local customs, and to become similar to local religions and beliefs. It would however be more accurate to say that Taoism developed from Shenism, since Shenism was there before. Taoism also developed from Chinese philosophy. With around 454 million adherents, or about 6.6% of the world population, Chinese folk religion is one of the major religious traditions in the world. In China more than 30% of the population adheres to Shenism or Taoism.
During the last 200 years, religion has been heavily suppressed in China, with rebellions such as the Taiping Movement or Cultural Revolution. Today, Chinese folk religion is experiencing a major revival in both Mainland China and Taiwan. 
The government of Mainland China has officially supported different forms of Shenism, such as Mazuism in Southern China (officially about 160 million Chinese are Mazuists), Huangdi worship, Black Dragon worship in Shaanxi, and Caishen worship.

The English title of the movie was "Snuff". This turned out to be a marketing ploy. The actress was not killed. Today, no real snuff movie is known.
Since the 1970s, the theme has been used by different movements in the United States. These groups usually argue that the government needs to control the media more than it currently does. The last such debate was about happy slapping. The debate is also fueled by violent pornography or videos of executions and murders.

Riace bronzes

The Bronzi di Riace (), sometimes "Riace Warriors", (460–430 BCE) are two large monumental Greek bronze sculptures. The statues are of nude bearded warriors. It is possible the statues depict two individuals. It is more likely that they represent "types". Rich Romans were collectors of Greek sculpture. It is probable the two warriors were being transported from their original site in Greece to one in Rome. Since the two warriors share so many similarities, they probably formed part of one Greek monument. 
The bronzes were found in the Ionian Sea on 16 August 1972 by Stefano Mariottini. He was on a scuba diving vacation near Reggio Calabria, Italy. The sculptures were found not far from shore at Riace Marina, a village near Porto Foricchio. The area was on an important shipping lane between the ports of Rome and the coastal cities of Greece. The bronzes may have been in an ancient shipwreck. They were either ripped from their moorings or thrown overboard to lighten the load.
The eyes are made of bone and glass. The teeth are made of silver. The lips and nipples are made of copper. The warriors once held spears and shields. One warrior once wore a helmet pushed up atop his head. The bronzes are in the Museo Nazionale della Magna Grecia in Reggio Calabria.

The Blue Boy

The Blue Boy is an oil painting by Thomas Gainsborough. It was painted about 1770. The boy in the picture might be Jonathan Buttall, the son of a hardware merchant. The boy wears a 17th-century suit. The painting is large. It measures 48 inches (1,200 mm) wide by 70 inches (1,800 mm) tall. 
The painting belonged to Jonathan Buttall until 1796. It was then sold many times. In 1921 it was sold to an art dealer. An American bought the painting from the dealer. The sale caused a furor in England. The British were losing a national treasure. The portrait is now in the Huntington Library, San Marino, California. "Pinkie" is a famous painting which hangs near it.

As You Like It

As You Like It is a play by William Shakespeare. It is a comedy. 
The play was written in 1599 or early 1600. Shakespeare rarely invented his own plays. He based his plays on stories by other writers. The story he used for "As You Like It" was "Rosalynde, Euphues Golden Legacy" (1590) by Thomas Lodge. 
"As You Like It" may have been first performed in 1603. This is not certain though. The play was first published in 1623 in the First Folio, a collection of all of Shakespeare's plays. 
"As You Like It" tells the story of a young woman named Rosalind. She has been banished from her uncle's court. Her uncle does not like her because she is gentle, beautiful, witty, and smart. Rosalind decides to live in the Forest of Arden with her cousin Celia and the court jester Touchstone. She dresses like a boy for self-protection. Several scenes involve Rosalind and the people who live in the forest. She is finally united with her sweetheart Orlando. 
Some people think the play is not as good as Shakespeare's other plays. Other people think it is a very good play. One of the great speeches in the play begins "All the world's a stage". 
The play is a favourite with theatre-goers. Rosalind, Touchstone, and a sour old man named Jacques are three of Shakespeare's greatest characters. The play has been adapted to a radio play, to a television show, and to musical theatre. A movie version of the play made in 1936 stars Laurence Olivier.

Mitochondrial DNA

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA or mDNA) is the DNA in mitochondria. It is inherited only from mothers, though there are a few rare exceptions.
Mitochondria are cellular organelles in eukaryotic cells. They convert chemical energy from food into a form that cells can use, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Mitochondrial DNA is only a small part of the DNA in a eukaryotic cell. Most of the DNA is in the cell nucleus on chromosomes. In plants, the chloroplasts have DNA as well.
In humans, mitochondrial DNA codes for 37 genes and with about 16,600 base pairs in a circle. Human mitochondrial DNA was the first significant part of the human genome to be sequenced. The mtDNA in plants is much larger: "Arabidopsis" has 367 kilobytes.

Bal du moulin de la Galette

Bal du moulin de la Galette () (1876) is a painting by Pierre-Auguste Renoir. It is in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. The painting depicts a typical Sunday afternoon at Moulin de la Galette in the district of Montmartre. In the late 19th century, working class Parisians would dress up and spend time there dancing, drinking, and eating galettes into the evening. "Bal du moulin de la Galette" is a typical Impressionist snapshot of real life. It shows a richness of form, a fluidity of brush stroke, and a flickering light. The French painter Gustave Caillebotte owned the painting for about 20 years. When he died it became the property of the French Republic. From 1896 to 1929 the painting hung in the Musée du Luxembourg. From 1929 it hung in the Musée du Louvre. It was sent to the Musée d'Orsay in 1986. Renoir painted a smaller version of the picture with the same title. This painting is in a private collection. For many years it was owned by John Hay Whitney. On May 17, 1990, his widow sold it for US$78 million at Sotheby's in New York City. It was one of the most expensive artworks ever sold.

Preparations for making "Bride" began shortly after "Frankenstein" opened in theaters. Photography started in January 1935. Many of the actors and crew from "Frankenstein" returned for "Bride". Critics and audiences loved the movie, but the censors found fault. 
Today, the movie is considered Whale's masterpiece. The director and others involved in the production were homosexuals. Some viewers detect a gay sensibility in the movie. Some of Whale's associates have dismissed the idea.

The Wild One

The Wild One (1953) is an outlaw biker movie. The movie was based on a short story that told of the damage done to a small California town in 1947 by thousands of rowdy outlaw bikers. The movie was directed by László Benedek. It stars Marlon Brando and Lee Marvin (in his movie debut) as rival biker gang leaders. It is the first outlaw biker movie. Critics and teenagers liked the movie. It inspired fads such as sideburns.
The movie was based on the short story "The Cyclists' Raid" by Frank Rooney. Rooney wrote the story after seeing photos in a "Life" magazine showing the damage done by 4,000 bikers to a small town in California after a weekend spree of violence in 1947. 
The story was published in "Harper's Magazine" in 1951. Kramer bought the sceen rights. Brando was leery about taking on the role of a lowlife bully after playing Stanley Kowalski in "A Streetcar Named Desire". He accepted though because he liked the director and the movie's social commentary.
Johnny leads his biker gang into a small town. The club members are rowdy. They hang out at the cafe drinking beer. Kathie works in the cafe. Johnny takes a liking to her. He asks her out. She declines. Johnny learns that she is a policeman's daughter. He changes his mind about dating her. 
Another biker gang rides into town. Their leader is Chino. He does not like Johnny. The two fight. Johnny wins. Chino's bikers vandalize the town and harass the townspeople. They tease Kathie. Johnny rescues her. The two ride into a park. Kathie is attracted to Johnny. He mauls her. She cries and runs off. Johnny rides after her.
The townspeople have had enough of the bikers. Some think Johnny assaulted Kathie. Johnny is caught by angry townsmen. They beat him, but he gets away on his motorcycle. The townspeople chase him. A tire iron is thrown. It hits Johnny and he falls from his bike. His motorcycle takes off without its rider. It hits and kills an old man. 
The sheriff arrives with his deputies. Order is restored. Johnny is arrested for killing the old man. Two witnesses say that Johnny was not responsible for the old man's death. The bikers are ordered to leave town. Johnny goes back to the cafe to say goodbye to Kathie. He then leaves.
Dave Kehr of "The Chicago Reader" has written: "Legions of Brando impersonators have turned his performance in this seminal 1954 motorcycle movie into self-parody, but it's still a sleazy good time." "Variety" noted that the film "is long on suspense, brutality and sadism ... All performances are highly competent." 
The Catholic Legion of Decency objected to the "excessive brutality, lack of moral compensation and suggestiveness" in "The Wild One". One French journalist described the movie as "the most unpleasant American movie ever seen." The magazine "Positif" described the movie as a masterpiece and "the [movie] of the year". 
Brando has written: "The public's reaction to "The Wild One" was, I believe, a product of its time and circumstances. It was only seventy-nine minutes long, short by modern standards, and it looks dated and corny now; I don't think it has aged well."
Brando's sideburns inspired a fad. James Dean and Elvis Presley wore them. Brando's character was parodied by Harvey Lembeck in the "beach party" movies of the early 1960s.
Presley used Johnny's image as a model for his role in "Jailhouse Rock". James Dean bought a Triumph TR5 Trophy motorcycle like Brando's Triumph Thunderbird 6T motorcycle. For 2010, Triumph motorcycles introduced a range of clothing and promotional items inspired by Brando's image from "The Wild One".

W.G. Grace

W.G. Grace , (William Gilbert Grace, 18 July 1848 – 23 October 1915) was an English physician and cricketer. 
Grace, always known as 'W.G.', was one of the greatest players, and was important in the development of the sport. He played first-class cricket for a record-equalling 44 seasons, from 1865 to 1908, during which he captained England, Gloucestershire County Cricket Club, the Gentlemen, MCC, the United South of England Eleven and several other teams. He came from a cricketing family. In 1880 W.G. with E.M. Grace, one of his elder brothers, and Fred Grace, his younger brother, was the first time three brothers played together in Test cricket. His father and a cousin were also good players.
Right-handed as both batsman and bowler, Grace dominated the sport during his career. His technical innovations and enormous influence had a lasting effect. An outstanding all-rounder, he excelled at batting, bowling and fielding. It is for his batting that he is most renowned. Usually opening the innings, he was admired for his mastery of all strokes: his level of expertise was said by contemporary reviewers to be unique. He generally captained the teams he played for at all levels because of his skill and tactical know-how, and his dominant personality.
Grace qualified as a medical practitioner in 1879. Because of his medical profession, he was nominally an amateur cricketer but he is said to have made more money from cricket than any professional. He was a very competitive player. Although he was one of the most famous men in England, he was also one of the most controversial on account of his gamesmanship and his financial skill. 
He took part in other sports: as a young man he was a champion 440 yard hurdler, and also played football for the Wanderers. In later life, he developed enthusiasm for golf, lawn bowls and curling.
Test cricket began in 1877, when Grace was already 28. He made his debut in 1880, scoring England's first-ever Test century against Australia. He played for England in 22 Tests through the 1880s and 1890s, all of them against Australia. He was an automatic selection for England at home, but his only Test-playing tour of Australia was that of 1891–92.
Grace's most significant Test was England v Australia in 1882 at The Oval. Thanks to Spofforth, the 'demon bowler', who took 14 wickets in the match, Australia won by 7 runs and the legend of The Ashes was born. Grace scored only 4 and 32, and he was held responsible for "firing up" Spofforth. This came about through a piece of gamesmanship by Grace when he made an unsporting, but legal, run out of one of the Australian batsmen. Grace died of a heart attack.

Lucille Ball

Lucille Désirée Ball (August 6, 1911 – April 26, 1989) was an American comedian, model, movie and television actress and studio executive. She was the star of the sitcoms "I Love Lucy", "The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour", "The Lucy Show", "Here's Lucy" and "Life With Lucy". Ball was one of the most popular and powerful actors in the United States during her lifetime. She also had one of Hollywood's longest careers.
Ball began acting in the 1930s. She became both a radio actress and B-movie star in the 1940s. Her television career began in the 1950s. She was still making movies in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1962, Ball became the first woman to run a major television studio, Desilu. This studio made many successful and popular television series.
Ball was born to Henry Durrell Ball (September 16, 1887 – February 19, 1915) and Desiree "DeDe" Evelyn Hunt (September 21, 1892 – July 20, 1977) in Jamestown, New York. Her family was Baptist.

The Blob – now a huge mass – engulfs the diner. It begins to ooze in through the windows. The occupants go to the cellar. The police try to kill The Blob by dropping a power line onto it. This attempt fails. It only serves to set the diner ablaze. Inside, the diner's owner uses a CO2 fire extinguisher to try to put out the fire. This causes The Blob to recoil. The Blob cannot stand cold. The town's teenagers gather all the fire extinguishers they can find. They use them to freeze The Blob. The United States Air Force sends in a jet to carry The Blob to the North Pole. It will remain frozen forever.

Japanese clock

The Japanese clock is a device made to tell the time according to Japanese tradition.
These clocks were introduced to Japan via Jesuit missionaries in the 16th century.
In 1612, the clockmaker of Philip II of Spain created a working timepiece which became a gift for Tokugawa Ieyasu.
One of the major features of the Japanese clock is that it has a mechanism for measuring unequal temporal hours. Usual clock tells hours at same intervals, but in the Japanese traditional timekeeping practice, a day had six daytime units from sunrise to sunset and six night units from sunset to sunrise. Then the Japanese clock was designed to adapt to this practice.

Polonaises Op. 40 (Chopin)

The Polonaise in A major, Op. 40, No. 1 (nicknamed the "Military" Polonaise) is a piece of music for solo piano. It was composed by Frédéric Chopin. It was published in 1838, with the Polonaise in C minor, Op. 40, No. 2. Anton Rubinstein wrote that the Polonaise in A major is the symbol of Polish glory, while the Polonaise in C minor is the symbol of Polish tragedy.
The polonaise is a Polish dance in 3/4 time. It has a distinctive rhythmic pattern which this polonaise follows unflinchingly. The A major Polonaise is written in an A-B-A form, with the B section being a "Trio". The polonaise opens with an A major chord. It continues in a vigorously masculine manner. The tempo indication is Allegro con brio (Fast, with bravura). The trio section begins in D major. The short passage following the first section of the trio is distinguished with trills for both hands on low C-sharps an octave apart. These trills suggest drum rolls. 
Charles Rosen writes, "Polonaises had been written by many composers before, including Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven; Schubert, in fact, wrote lots of them. But nothing like the violence of Chopin’s military polonaises, ... The military polonaises were certainly understood as political statements of patriotism for his country, which was struggling to obtain its freedom ... these military polonaises have a decidedly popular character ..."

Kinderszenen

Kinderszenen (original spelling "Kinderscenen", (), Opus 15, is a set of 13 pieces for solo piano by Robert Schumann. It was published in 1838. Schumann was looking back on his childhood when composing these pieces. He had originally written 30 movements for Scenes from Childhood. He chose only 13 for the final set. The unused movements were published years later in "Bunte Blätter", Opus 99, and "Albumblätter" (). 
Schumann originally titled the work "Leichte Stücke" (). The titles for the individual pieces were only added after the music was complete. Schumann described the titles as "nothing more than delicate hints for execution and interpretation". Timothy Taylor has discussed Schumann's choice of titles for this work in the context of the changing situation of music in 19th century culture and economics. In 1974, Eric Sams noted that there is no known complete manuscript of "Kinderszenen".

<doc id="328877" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=328877" title="Giselle">
Giselle

Giselle; or, The Wilis is a romantic ballet in two acts. Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges and Théophile Gautier wrote the story of the ballet. They based it on a short prose passage in Heinrich Heine's "De l'Allemagne". They also used Victor Hugo's poem "Fantômes". Adolphe Adam wrote the music. Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot designed the dances. Carlotta Grisi danced the role of Giselle in the first production. The scenery was created by Pierre Cisceri. 
The story is set in Germany during the Renaissance. Giselle is a peasant girl. She falls in love with Albrecht. He is a nobleman pretending to be a peasant boy. Giselle is shocked to discover Albrecht is going to marry the princess Bathilde. Her heart breaks. She goes mad (insane, crazy) and dies. One night, she rises from her grave. She wants to protect Albrecht from the Wilis. The Wilis are the ghostly spirits of dead girls. They force men to dance to their deaths. 
The ballet was first performed in Paris on Monday 28 June 1841 at the Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique. It was a great success. It was staged almost at once by other ballet companies in Europe, Russia, and the United States. Grisi was declared another Taglioni. Taglioni was the age's greatest ballerina. Ballet historian Grace Robert writes ""Giselle" ... is the archetype of the ballets of the romantic age".
The ballet opens on an autumn morning in Germany. Giselle and Albrecht are in love. Hilarion is in love with Giselle, too. She does not love him though. He grows jealous. He promises to take revenge. Albrecht's gentle manners arouse Hilarion's suspicions. Albrecht is really a Duke. He is pretending to be a peasant. The peasant boys and girls start a waltz. Giselle asks Albrecht to dance with her. Giselle's mother says her daughter has a weak heart. She will die if she does not give up dancing. She is afraid that Giselle will become one of the Wilis. The Wilis are ghostly female spirits. They dance men to death.
A hunting horn is heard in the distance. Albrecht becomes nervous. He hurries away with the peasants. The Prince of Courland, his daughter Bathilde, and their courtiers enter. They are looking for a place to rest after the hunt. Giselle and her mother bring them food and drink. Bathilde takes an interest in Giselle. They each say that they are in love, and soon to be married. Albrecht returns with the peasants. Bathilde says he is her future husband. Giselle is shocked. She goes mad and dies in her mother's arms. Albrecht is chased away by the peasants.
It is midnight in a dark wood. A pool of water is in the distance. Gamekeepers enter. Hilarion warns them that the spot is haunted by the Wilis. The gamekeepers run away. The Queen of the Wilis rises from the weeds to call the Wilis together. Giselle is about to become one of them. She rises from her grave. She dances. Albrecht enters to pray at Giselle's grave. He sees Giselle. They dance. The Wilis trap Hilarion. They force him to dance. They throw him into the pool to his death. The Queen of the Wilis wants Albrecht to die too. Giselle does not want this. She wants to save his life. Day breaks. The Wilis disappear. Giselle returns to her grave. Bathilde and the courtiers enter. They are looking for Albrecht. He falls into their arms exhausted.
The French Revolution (17891799) created a French middle class. These people did not like tastes and values of the aristocracy. These tastes and values had influenced French art and literature since the reign of Louis XIV. The power of the aristocracy had ended with the Revolution. Thousands of aristocrats had died on the guillotine, or in massacres. Many died in prisons, or had fled France for safety in other lands. 
After the Revolution, French ballet directors and designers turned their attention to stories based on the Greek and Roman mythologies. The aristocracy liked these stories. The directors and designers however turned instead to the stories the middle class liked. These stories were based on real life, real places, past times, everyday people, and the supernatural.
Two ballets with such stories caused great excitement in Paris in the 1830s. In November 1831, Meyerbeer's opera "Robert le diable" had its first performance. It included a short ballet called "The Ballet of the Nuns". In this little ballet, dead nuns rise from their graves. They dance in the moonlight. The public loved this ballet. In March 1832, the ballet "La Sylphide" was performed. This ballet is about a beautiful sylph (fairy). She loves James, a young Scotsman. Tragedy occurs. James accidentally kills the sylph. 
This ballet brought Marie Taglioni before the French public. She was the first to dance "en pointe". She did this for artistic reasons rather than spectacle. She was also the first to wear the white, bell-shaped, calf-length ballet skirt. This skirt is now considered an essential feature of the romantic ballet. Poet and critic Théophile Gautier attended the first performance of "La Sylphide". His ideas for "Giselle" would show touches of "La Sylphide" ten years later. It would be set in a real place and in the past, for example, and would be about everyday people and supernatural women.
In an 1841 news article announcing the first performance of "Giselle", Théophile Gautier recorded his part in the creation of the ballet. He had read Heinrich Heine's description of the Wilis in "De l'Allemagne", and thought these evil spirits would make a "pretty ballet". He planned their story for Act 2, and settled upon a verse by Victor Hugo called "Fantômes" to provide the inspiration for Act 1. This verse is about a beautiful 15 year old Spanish girl who loves to dance. She becomes too warm at a ball, and dies of a chill in the cool morning. 
Heine's prose passage in "De l'Allemagne" tells of supernatural young women called the Wilis. They have died before their wedding day and rise from their graves in the middle of the night to dance. Any young man who crosses their path is forced to dance to his death. In another book, the Wilis are said to be jilted young women who have died and become vampires. This is assumed to be the reason that they hate men.
Gautier thought Heine's Wilis and Hugo's fifteen year old Spanish girl would make a good ballet story. His first idea was to present an empty ballroom glittering with crystal and candlelight. The Wilis would cast a spell over the floor. Giselle and other dancers would enter and whirl through the room, unable to resist the spell to keep them dancing. Giselle would try to keep her lover from partnering other girls. The Queen of the Wilis would enter, lay her cold hand on Giselle's heart, and the girl would drop dead. 
Gautier was not satisfied with this story. It was basically a succession of dances with one moment of drama at its end. He had no experience writing ballet stories so he called upon Vernoy de St. Georges, a man who had written many stories for the ballet. St. Georges liked Gautier's basic idea of the frail young girl and the Wilis. He wrote the story of Giselle as it is known today in three days, and sent it to Léon Pillet, the director of the Paris Opéra. 
Pillet wanted to present a beautiful young Italian dancer named Carlotta Grisi to the public. He considered "La Sylphide", but Adèle Dumilâtre reminded him that the role had been promised to her. A ballet in preparation, "La Rosière de Gand", was suggested, but Grisi objected. The role was too long and the story was not suitable for dance. Pillet needed a good story, and he found it in "Giselle". Grisi liked the story as much as Pillet did, so "Giselle" was put into development at once.
Adolphe Adam was a popular writer of ballet and opera music in early 19th-century France. He wrote with great speed. He completed "Giselle" in about two months. The music was written in the smooth, song-like style of the day called "cantilena". This style is well known to music lovers from Bellini's opera "Norma" and Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor". 
Adam used several "leitmotifs" in the ballet. A "leitmotif" is a short musical phrase that is associated with a certain character, event, or idea. Adam's leitmotifs are heard several times throughout the ballet. A leitmotif is associated with Giselle, and another with Albrecht. Hilarion's motif marks his every entrance. It suggests the Fate theme in Beethoven's "Fifth Symphony". Another leitmotif is associated with the "he loves me, he loves me not" flower test in Act 1. This leitmotif is heard again in the mad scene, and in Act 2 when Giselle offers flowers to Albrecht. The Wilis have their own motif. It is heard in the overture, in Act 1 when Berthe tells the story of the Wilis, and in the mad scene. It is heard again in Act 2 when the Wilis make their first entrance. The hunting horn motif marks sudden surprises. This motif is heard when Albrecht is exposed as a nobleman.
The music was completely original with Adam. A critic noted however that Adam had borrowed eight bars from a romance by a Miss Puget and three bars from the huntsman's chorus in Carl Maria von Weber's opera "Euryanthé". In addition, two pieces by Friedrich Burgmüller were put into the ballet. One was a waltz called "Souvenir de Ratisbonne". The other music was a group of dances performed by Giselle's friends. It is unknown who put these pieces into the ballet.
One dance historian writes:
Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot designed the dances for "Giselle". Perrot and Carlotta Grisi were lovers, and Perrot designed all of Grisi's dances and all of her pantomime. Everyone in the Paris dance world knew that Perrot had designed Grisi's dances, and Coralli said so, but Perrot was given no official credit in the printed materials such as posters and programs. This was most likely done to prevent Perrot from collecting royalties (money, profits) on the ballet. Perrot liked bold touches and planned several rapid aerial swoops on wires in Act 2 for Giselle. Grisi was afraid of these swoops. A stage hand was brought in to test the swoops. He crashed face-first into the scenery. The swoops were abandoned. 
Cyril Beaumont writes that "Giselle" is made up of two elementsdance and mime. Act 1 features short mimed scenes, he points out, and episodes of dancing which are fused with mime. In Act 2, mime has become fused entirely with dance. He writes that the choreographic vocabulary is composed of a small number of simple steps: 
Beaumont speculates that the simple steps were deliberately planned to allow the "utmost expressiveness." 
Parts of "Giselle" have been cut or changed since the ballet's first night. Giselle's Act 1 pantomime scene in which she tells Albrecht of her strange dream is cut. The peasant "pas de deux" in Act 1 is cut back a bit. The Prince of Courland and his daughter Bathilde used to make their entrance on horseback, but today they walk on. In the original production, the Prince and Bathilde were present at Giselle's death, but now they leave the scene before she dies. The machines used to make Giselle fly and to make her disappear are no longer used. A trapdoor is sometimes employed to make Giselle rise from her grave and then to make her sink into it at the end of Act 2. 
At the end of Act 2, Bathilde formerly entered with the courtiers to search for Albrecht. He took a few unsteady steps toward them and collapsed into their arms. This moment was an artistic parallel to the Act 1 finale when the peasants gathered about the dead Giselle. Now, Bathilde and the courtiers are cut, and Albrecht slowly leaves the stage alone.
Ethnic music, dance, and costume were a large part of romantic ballet. At the time "Giselle" was written, people thought of Germany when they heard a waltz because the waltz was of German origin. Giselle makes her first entrance to the music of a waltz, and the audience would have known at once that the ballet was set in Germany. Adam wrote three waltzes for "Giselle": two for Giselle and one for the Wilis. Adam wrote that the "Giselle Waltz" in Act 1 has "all the German color indicated by the locality." People agreed. One critic wrote: "A lovely waltz ... in the Germanic spirit of the subject". 
At first, Gautier thought that some of the dancers in the Act 2 waltz for the Wilis should dress in ethnic costume and dance ethnic steps. Adam put bits of French, Spanish, German, and Indian -sounding music in the waltz for this purpose. Gautier's "ethnic" idea was dropped as the ballet developed however, and it has not been picked up by modern producers. Today, Act 2 is a "ballet blanc"a "white" ballet in which all the ballerinas and the "corps de ballet" are dressed in full, white, bell-shaped skirts and the dances have a geometric design.
The historical period for "Giselle" is not indicated in the story. Paul Lormier, the chief costume designer at the Paris Opéra, probably consulted Gautier on this matter. It is also possible that Pillet had the ballet's budget in mind and decided to use the many Renaissance-style costumes in the Opéra's wardrobe for "Giselle". These costumes were said to have been those from Rossini's "William Tell" (1829) and Berlioz's "Benvenuto Cellini" (1838). Lormier certainly designed the costumes for the principal characters. His costumes were in use at the Opéra until the ballet was dropped from the repertory in 1853. 
"Giselle" was revived in 1863 with new costumes by Lormier's assistant, Alfred Albert. Albert's costumes are closer to those of modern productions than those of Lormier, and were in use at the opera until 1868. The ballet was revived again in 1924 with scenery and costumes by Alexandre Benois. He wanted to revive the costumes of the original production but dropped the idea, believing the critics would charge him with a lack of imaginative creativity.
Pierre Luc Charles Ciceri was the chief set designer at the Paris Opéra from 1815 to 1847. He designed the sets for the first production of "Giselle". Gautier was not specific about the ballet's locale, but placed it in "some mysterious corner of Germany ... on the other side of the Rhine". This would have been the eastern side. 
"Giselle" was two months in rehearsal. This was a very long rehearsal time for the period. Even so, Ciceri did not have enough time to design sets for both acts and focused on the second act. The sets for the first act were actually those designed for the 1838 ballet, "La Fille du Danube" by Adam. An illustration from "Les Beautés de l'Opera" of 1845 shows Giselle's cottage with a roof of straw on the left, and Albrecht's cottage on the right. The two cottages are framed by the branches of two large trees on either sides of the stage. Between the two cottages, in the distance, appears a castle and slopes covered with vineyards. Although this scene was not designed for "Giselle", it has remained the model for most modern productions. Ciceri's set was in use until the ballet was dropped from the repertoire in 1853. At that time, Gautier noticed that the sets were falling apart: "Giselle's cottage has barely three or four straws on its roof." 
The Act 2 illustration from "Les Beautés" shows a dark wood with a pool of water in the distance. The branches of aged trees create an arch overhead. Beneath these branches on the left is a marble cross with 'Giselle' written on it. From one of its arms hangs the crown of grape leaves Giselle wore as Queen of the Vintage. On the stage, thick weeds and wildflowers (200 bulrushes and 120 branches of flowers) were the undergrowth. The gas jets of the footlights and those overhead suspended in the flies were turned low to create a mood of mystery and terror. 
A circular hole was cut into the backdrop and covered with a transparent material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon. The light was occasionally manipulated to suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool to be made of large mirrors. Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival however, the mirrors were acquired for this scene.
Adam thought Ciceri's backdrop for Act 1 was "not so good ... it is all weak and pale" but he liked the set for Act 2: "[Ciceri's] second act is a delight, a dark humid forest filled with bulrushes and wild flowers, and ending with a sunrise, seen at first through the trees at the end of the piece, and very magical in its effect." The sunrise also delighted the critics.
The balletomanes of Paris became very excited as the opening night of "Giselle" approached. News reports kept their interest alive. Some reports said that Grisi had had an accident. Some reports said that the conductor was ill with a tumour. Still others said that the stage hands feared for their safety.
Hopes that the ballet would be ready in May were dashed. Opening night was postponed several times. Grisi was absent for a few days and her return was delayed to protect her health. Lighting, trapdoors, and scene changes needed further rehearsals. Cuts were made in Grisi's role to spare the dancer's health. Instead of returning to her tomb at the end of the ballet, it was decided Giselle would be placed on a bed of flowers and sink slowly into the earth. This touch preserved the romantic mood of the Act 2 finale.
At last, on Monday 28 June 1841, the curtain rose on "Giselle" in the Salle Le Peletier. Grisi played Giselle with Lucien Petipa as her lover Albrecht, M. Simon as the gamekeeper Hilarion, and Adèle Dumilâtre as Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis. Typical of the theatrical practices of the time, "Giselle" was preceded by an excerpt from another productionin this case, the third act of Rossini's opera, "Moise". 
In spite of the chief machinist shouting orders to his crew] that could be heard by the audience, "Giselle" was a great success. Grisi was a sensation. Ballet-goers regarded her as another Taglioni, the greatest ballerina of the period.
"Giselle" was a great artistic and commercial success. "Le Constitutionnel" praised Act 2 for its "poetic effects". "Moniteur des théâtres" wrote that Grisi "runs [and] flies across the stage like a gazelle in love". One critic made a detailed analysis of the music in "La France Musicale". He thought the Act 1 waltz "ravishing", and noted that the scene of Berthe's narrative was filled with "quite new" harmonic modulations. He praised other moments in Act 1 (especially the mad scene), and was in raptures with the music of Act 2, singling out the entrance of the Wilis and the viola solo played through Giselle's last moments. He thought the flute and harp music accompanying Giselle as she disappeared into her grave at ballet's end "full of tragic beauty."
Coralli was praised for the Act 1 peasant "pas de deux" and for the "elegance" of Act 2. Coralli followed a suggestion made by Gautier and picked the most beautiful girls in the company to play the peasants and the Wilis. One observer thought the selection process cruel: the almost-beautiful girls were turned away without a second thought.
Grisi and Petipa were great successes as the tragic lovers. Gautier praised their performance in Act 2, writing that the two dancers made the act "a real poem, a choreographic elegy full of charm and tenderness ... More than one eye that thought it was seeing only [dance] was surprised to find its vision obscured by a tearsomething that does not often happen in a ballet ... Grisi danced with a perfection ... that places her in the ranks between Elssler and Taglioni ... Her miming surpassed every expectation ... She is nature and artlessness personified."
Adam thought Petipa "charming" as both dancer and actor, and that he had "rehabilitated" male dancing with his performance. Of Dumilâtre he wrote, "... in spite of her coldness, [Dumilâtre] deserved the success she achieved by the correctness and the 'mythological' quality of her poses: perhaps this word may seem a little pretentious, but I can think of no other to express such cold and noble dancing as would suit Minerva in a merry mood, and in this respect [Dumilâtre] seems to bear a strong resemblamce to that goddess."
"Giselle" made 6500 francs between June and September 1841. This was twice the amount for the same time period in 1839. Grisi's salary was increased to make her the top earner among the dancers at the Opéra. Souvenirs were sold. Pictures of Grisi as Giselle were printed, and sheet music arrangements were made for social dancing. The sculptor Emile Thomas made a statuette of Giselle in her Act 2 costume. A silk cloth was manufactured called "façonné Giselle", and Madame Lainné, a milliner, sold an artificial flower called 'Giselle'. The ballet was parodied at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal in October 1841.
"Giselle" was performed in Paris from its debut in 1841 to 1849. It was then dropped from the repertory. Grisi always danced the title role. The ballet was revived in 1852 and 1853, but without Grisi. The work was dropped from the repertory after 1853. It was revived in 1863 for a Russian ballerina then dropped in 1868. It was revived almost 50 years later in 1924 for the debut of Olga Spessivtzeva. This production was revived in 1932 and 1938.
"Giselle" was produced by other ballet companies in Europe and America almost immediately after its first night. The British had their first taste of "Giselle"not with the ballet but with a drama based on the ballet called "Giselle, or The Phantom Night Dancers" by William Moncrieff. He had seen the ballet in Paris the same year. The play was performed on 23 August 1841 at the Theatre Royal, Sadler's Wells. 
The actual ballet was first staged in London at Her Majesty's Theatre on 12 March 1842 with Grisi as Giselle and Perrot as Albrecht. The dances were credited to Perrot and one Deshayes. It was revived many times, once in 1884 with a Mlle. Sismondi in the role of Albrecht. This production was received with little enthusiasm. It was preceded by the operetta "Pocahontas".
The ballet was staged by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1911 at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden with Tamara Karsavina and Nijinsky as Giselle and Albrecht. Anna Pavlova danced Giselle with her own company in 1913. Alicia Markova danced the role with the Vic-Wells Ballet in 1934, and Margot Fonteyn took the role in 1937 when Markova left the company. The English loved "Giselle". In 1942, for example, three different companies were dancing the ballet in London.
"Giselle" was first performed in Russia at the Bolshoi Theatre, St. Petersburg, on 18 December 1842. Gedeonov, the Director of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres, sent his Ballet Master Titus to Paris to find a new ballet for ballerina Elena Andreyanova. Titus picked "Giselle". The Ballet Master then staged the work completely from memory in St. Petersburg. Perrot produced "Giselle" in St. Petersburg in 1851. He made many changes to the ballet in his years of service to the Imperial Ballet. In the 1880s, Ballet Master Marius Petipa made many changes to the Perrot production.
"Giselle" was first staged in Italy at Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 17 January 1843. The music however was not Adam's, but that of one N. Bajetti. The dances were not the original either, but those of one A. Cortesi. It is possible, but unknown if, the ballet was first staged in the provincial theatres.
In 1844, American ballerina Mary Ann Lee arrived in Paris to study with Coralli for a year. She returned to the United States in 1841 with the directions for "Giselle" and other ballets. Lee was the first to present "Giselle" in the United States. She did this on 1 January 1846 in Boston at the Howard Athenæum. George Washington Smith played Albrecht. Lee danced "Giselle" (again with Smith) on 13 April 1846 at the Park Theatre in New York City.
Nijinsky was going to dance Albrecht for the first time in St. Petersburg in January 1911. The Czar and his family would be present. Diaghilev wanted Nijinsky to wear the Renaissance-style costume he had worn in Paris the same month. It was easier to dance in than the thick pants of traditional Russian Albrechts, but his genitals (though covered) could be detected. He was ordered not to wear it. Nijinsky said that he only wanted to dance well. According to Stravinsky, Nijinsky wore not much more than the tightest tights and a padded athletic supporter (jockstrap). The next day, the angry director of the Imperial Theatres ordered Nijinsky to apologize. Complaints about the dancer were collected here and there. Nijinsky knew Diaghilev would give him work, so he resigned. On 24 January 1911 he was officially dismissed from the Imperial Theatres.

Roux

Roux is a cooking mixture of wheat flour and butter (or other fat). It is the basis of many types of French sauce for cooking.
Roux is the thickening agent of three of the mother sauces of classical French cuisine: "sauce béchamel", "sauce velouté" and "sauce espagnole". Clarified butter, vegetable oils, or lard are commonly used fats. It thickens gravy, other sauces, soups and stews. It is made from equal parts of flour and fat by weight. 
When used in Italian cooking, roux is traditionally equal parts of butter and flour. In Cajun cuisine, roux is almost always made with oil instead of butter and is dark brown in colour. This lends much richness of flavour, but less thickening power. Hungarian cuisine uses rendered lard or vegetable oil instead of butter for the preparation of "roux" (called "rántás" in Hungarian).

Minute Waltz

The "Minute Waltz" is the nickname for the Waltz in D flat major, Op. 64, No. 1 by Frederic Chopin. It was written in 1847. It is a piece of music for the piano. It is sometimes called "The Waltz of the Little Dog" (). This is because Chopin was watching a little dog chase its tail when he wrote it. The little dog was "Marquis". He belonged to Chopin's friend George Sand. Marquis had befriended Chopin. The composer mentioned Marquis in several of his letters. In one letter dated 25 November 1846, Chopin wrote: "Please thank Marquis for missing me and for sniffing at my door." 
The waltz was published by Breitkopf & Härtel. It was the first of three waltzes in a collection of waltzes called "Trois Valses, Op. 64". The publisher gave the waltz its popular nickname "Minute". The word here means small or little. The tempo marking is Molto vivace (), but Chopin did not intend the waltz to be played in one minute as some believe. A typical performance will last between one and a half to two and a half minutes. 
The time signature is 3/4. The waltz is 138 measures long with one fifteen-measure repeat. The waltz is written in ternary, or ABA form. The A section is characterized by a whirling line of eighth notes and triplets over the "om-pah-pah" rhythm of the waltz. The whirling line of the A section is abandoned in the B section. This section consists of a consistent half note and quarter note pattern from bar to bar. The B section breaks off and a long trill heralds the return of the A section, which is repeated in full. The waltz ends with a descending scale.

Piano Sonata No. 16 (Mozart)

The Sonata No. 16 in C major, K. 545, is a piece of music for solo piano. It was composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. On 26 June 1788, he added the piece to his catalogue as "a little Piano Sonata for beginners". He may have written the piece for a pupil. If he did, that pupil is not known. In the end, the story behind the sonata is a mystery.
On 2 August 1788 Mozart wrote a letter to his sister Nannerl. She was living in Salzburg. He had sent her some pieces for the piano. He wrote, "Indeed you have every reason to be vexed with me! But will you really be so, when you receive by this mail coach my very latest compositions for the keyboard? Surely not! This, I hope, will make everything all right again." This passage might refer to the Sonata in C. But it may refer to other keyboard compositions Mozart wrote the same year. 
The manuscript is lost. The piece was not published during Mozart's lifetime. It was first published in February 1805 by the Bureau des arts et d'Industrie in Vienna. It was titled "Sonate facile pour le pianoforte" (). At least three more editions were published within a short time. Breitkopf & Härtel did not include it in their Oeuvres complettes. A typical performance lasts about 14 minutes.
The first movement is written in sonata form. It is in the key of C major. The tempo marking is Allegro (Fast). The opening theme is accompanied by an Alberti bass played in the left hand. A bridge passage composed of scales follows, arriving at a cadence in G major, the key in which the second theme is then played. A codetta follows to conclude the exposition. The exposition is repeated. The development starts in G minor and modulates through several keys. The recapitulation begins in the subdominant key of F major. According to Charles Rosen, the practice of beginning a recapitulation in the subdominant was "rare at the time [the sonata] was written"..
The second movement is in the key of G major, the dominant key of C major. The music modulates to the dominant key of D major, and then back to G major in which the exposition is heard again. For the development, the music modulates to G minor, then B♭ major, then C minor, then G minor and finally back to G major, at which point the recapitulation occurs followed by a short coda.
The third movement is in rondo form. It is in the tonic key of C major. The first theme is lively. It sets the mood of the piece. The second theme is in G major. It has an Alberti bass in the left hand. The first theme appears again. A third theme is in a minor key. It modulates through different keys before returning to C major. The first theme appears again. It is followed by a coda, and the rondo ends in C major. 
The finale was transcribed to F major. It was put together with a solo piano arrangement of the second movement of the violin sonata in F major. It became the Piano Sonata in F major, K. 547a.

Minuet in G (Beethoven)

The Minuet in G, WoO 10, No. 2 is a piece of music for the piano. It was composed by Ludwig van Beethoven. The piece was originally written for orchestra. This version was lost. Only an arrangement for piano exists. It is a very popular piece, especially among beginning pianists.
The piece is composed in what is called ternary form or ABA form. This means that the piece has three distinct sections. The first and the third sections (the A sections) are the same. The second section (the B section) is entirely different music. The B section often provides a contrast in some way to the A section. The tempo marking for the Minuet in G is Moderato. The meter is 3/4.
The A section is composed of two 8 bar passages for a total of 16 bars. The tune is characterized by a repetitious but elegant dotted eighth note and sixteenth note legato pattern. The first 8 bars are played and repeated. This passage begins in the tonic key of G major, and modulates to the dominant key of D major. The second 8 bars are played and repeated. This passage begins in the dominant key of D major, and modulates to the tonic key of G major. The first phrase of this passage begins with 4 bars of principally quarter notes. The phrase returns to the dotted eighth note pattern at its close. Thus, the entire A section begins and ends in the tonic key with brushes on the dominant here and there. The right hand is occupied with playing mostly thirds and sixths through the A section. The left hand plays only quarter notes. 
Like the A section, the B section (or the Trio) is composed of two 8 bar passages for a total of 16 bars. Like the A section, it begins in the tonic key of G major, and modulates to the dominant key of D major at the end of the first 8 bars. This passage is repeated. The second 8 bars begin in the dominant key and end in the tonic key. These 8 bars are repeated. The entire B section is characterized by flowing, uninterrupted eighth notes in the right hand. The left hand plays quarter notes but briefly joins the right hand in playing eighth notes at the beginning of the second 8 bar passage. The left hand returns to playing quarter notes as the passage closes. When the B section is completed and all the repeats have been taken, the piece returns the A section. This return is usually played without performing the repeats.

Standing start

A standing start is a type of start in auto racing events where cars are standing still when the race begins. In a standing start, cars are completely still when a green signal is given to start the race. This often follows a set of lights that count down to the start of the race. Standing starts are common in many motorsports, including drag racing, most single-seat (Formula One and GP2 Series), Touring Cars (most notably British and World Touring Cars), V8 Supercars, and many types of short-course off-road races. The standing start often occurs following a parade lap.
The opposite of a standing start is a rolling start. Standing starts are often deemed safer in Formula sports because of high acceleration speeds, which could cause problems if a rolling start were used. A standing start can cause problems like stalled cars being hit by the driver who starts behind them on the grid. Motorsports using standing starts usually penalize drivers who "jump the start", or redlight, by moving before the green light is lit.

Twelve Variations on &quot;Ah vous dirai-je, Maman&quot;

Twelve Variations on "Ah vous dirai-je, Maman", K. 265/300e, is a piece of music for piano. It was composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1781 or 1782. The variations were first published in Vienna in 1785. The piece consists of twelve variations on the French folk song "Ah! vous dirai-je, Maman". The French melody first appeared in 1761. It has been used for many children's songs, such as "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star", "Baa, Baa, Black Sheep" and the "Alphabet Song". Only Variations XI and XII have tempo indications, "Adagio" and "Allegro" respectively.
It was once thought that this piece was composed in 1778 when Mozart was briefly living in Paris. It was assumed that he could only have picked up a French folk song while living in France. Based on this assumption, the piece was re-numbered from K. 265 to K. 300e in the chronological catalogue of Mozart's compositions. Later analysis of Mozart's manuscript indicated 1781/1782 as the probable composition date.

François Pierre La Varenne

François Pierre de la Varenne (Burgundy, 1615 – Dijon 1678) was the author of "Le Cuisinier françois" (1651), the founding text of modern French cuisine. 
La Varenne, in the 17th century, broke with the Italian traditions that had revolutionized mediaeval French cookery in the 16th century. La Varenne wrote for professional chefs, and codified French cuisine for the age of Louis XIV. 
The seventeenth century saw French cooking come into the modern era. The heavily spiced flavours of the Middle Ages were abandoned in favour of the natural flavours of French foods. Exotic spices (saffron, cinnamon, cumin, ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, nigella, seeds of paradise) were, with the exception of pepper, replaced by local herbs (parsley, thyme, bayleaf, chervil, sage, tarragon). New vegetables like cauliflower, asparagus, peas, cucumber and artichoke were introduced. Special care was given to the cooking of meat in order to conserve maximum flavour. Vegetables had to be fresh and tender. Fish, with the improvement of transportation, had to be impeccably fresh. Preparation had to respect the taste and visual look of the ingredients instead of masking them as had been done before.
La Varenne introduced the first bisque and Béchamel sauce. He replaced crumbled bread with roux as the base for sauces, and lard with butter. Here one finds the first use of the terms bouquet garni, "fonds de cuisine" (stocks) and reductions, and the use of egg-whites for clarification. It also has the earliest recipe in print for mille-feuille. The cooking of vegetables is discussed, a novelty. In a fragrant sauce for asparagus there is evidence of an early form of hollandaise sauce:
La Varenne had earlier (1650) written a book on "confitures"—jams, jellies and preserves. That included recipes for syrups, compotes and a great variety of fruit drinks, as well as a section on salads.
La Varenne wrote a third book, "Le Pâtissier françois" (Paris 1653), which was the first comprehensive French work on pastry-making. In 1662 was the first of the combined editions that presented all three works together. All the early editions of La Varenne's works—"Le Cuisinier françois" ran through some thirty editions in seventy-five years—are extremely rare; like children's books, they too were worn to pieces, in the kitchen, and simply used up.
Pirated editions of "Le Cuisinier françois" were printed in Amsterdam (1653) and The Hague (1654-56). Soon there were imitators: "Le cuisinier françois méthodique" was published anonymously in Paris, 1660. The English translation, "The French Cook" (London 1653) was the first French cookbook translated into English. It introduced professional terms like "à la mode", "au bleu" (very rare), and "au naturel" which are now standard culinary expressions. Its success can be gauged from the fact that over 250,000 copies were printed in about 250 editions and it remained in print until 1815. 
La Varenne had ten years' experience as "chef de cuisine" to the Marquis d'Uxelles, to whom he dedicated his publications and whom he immortalized in "duxelles", finely-minced mushrooms seasoned with herbs and shallots, which is still a favourite flavouring for fish and vegetables. 
"Le Cuisinier françois" was reprinted in 1983, published by Editions Montalba with a comprehensive introductory essay.

Handel's Largo

"Handel's Largo" is the popular title for an aria composed by George Frideric Handel. He wrote it in 1738 for the opera "Serse" (). The opera was a failure. It closed after only five performances. One hundred years later though the aria was resurrected. It became a big hit. It was performed at solemn occasions such as funerals and weddings. It was arranged for all sorts of instruments and voices. It is known by many people as "Ombra mai fu" because those words are the first words of the aria. The title is Italian and means "Never was a shade". The aria is sung by the main character, Xerxes I of Persia. He is admiring the shade of a tree. The original tempo is larghetto (a little slow and solemn). The aria is short. It is only 52 bars long. It lasts about four minutes. In the opera, a string section accompanies the singer. These strings are first and second violins, viola, and basses. The key signature is F major. The time signature is 3/4 time.

Water Music (Handel)

The Water Music is a group of pieces for Baroque orchestra. The pieces were composed by George Frideric Handel. The "Water Music" is made up of three suites. These suites include minuets, hornpipes, bourrées, and other dances. In sum, there are three suites (F major, D major, G major), made up of 21 individual pieces. 
Legend says the three suites were first played on a trip taken by King George I of England up the Thames to Chelsea or Lambeth on 17 July 1717. The King had known Handel for a long time. For some reason though, he was angry with Handel. The "Water Music" was Handel's way of appeasing the King. Fifty musicians floated alongside the King's barge playing the suites. The King was so pleased he ordered "Water Music" played three times.
All the instruments in the Baroque orchestra were included in the composition, except the harpsichord and timpani. It would have been difficult to bring these instruments aboard a barge. The instruments in a complete performance are a flute, two oboes, one bassoon, two horns, two trumpets, strings, and continuo.

Alcina

Alcina is an opera seria with music by George Frideric Handel. The libretto was written by Riccardo Broschi. The opera is based on an episode in Ludovico Ariosto's "Orlando furioso", an epic poem set in the time of Charlemagne's wars against Islam. Handel composed several little ballets in the opera for the famous dancer Marie Sallé.
"Alcina" was first performed on 16 April 1735 at Covent Garden in London. It was revived in Germany in 1738. It was not performed again until 1928. 
Joan Sutherland sang the role for her debut in Venice in 1960. She sang it again the same year in Dallas. She sang it at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1962. Renée Fleming sang the role in Chicago in 1999. 
Alcina is a sorceress. She changes people into stones, trees, and animals. Bradamente lands on Alcina's island looking for her fiancé Ruggiero. He has been enchanted by Alcina. He is in love with her. 
Bradamente has a magic ring that allows her to break spells. She intends to use it to free Alcina's victims. She lets Ruggiero wear it. He sees at once that Alcina is a cruel enchantress and that her island is a desert. 
Alcina is truly in love with Ruggiero. Her magic powers slip away. Bradamente and Ruggiero destroy an urn that is the source of Alcina's power. Alcina's world disappears. Her victims become humans again.

Exception handling

In computing, an exception is a special situation where the program cannot do things the way it usually would and is forced to do something else instead. One layer of the system uses an exception to give another layer information about special states the system is currently in. The different layers of software or hardware have contracts, that tell what can be expected; this is generally known as Programming by Contract. In the context of exception handling, a program is said to be exception-safe, if exceptions that occur will not produce side-effects (such as memory leaks), will not change stored data so that it becomes unreadable, or generate output that is invalid. There are different levels of exception safety:
Usually, a programmer will try to "catch" the exception early so that problems don't get worse over time.
Suppose a program tries to add something to an "array", or group of "objects" that doesn't exist. This is called a "null reference". Look at the following code from the Java programming language:
This code throws what programmers call a "null-pointer exception". This is fixed by adding "codice_1" in front of the code that might throw the exception, like is done with the code shown below:

Microsoft InfoPath is a piece of software that Microsoft sells. InfoPath is used to create computer-ized versions of documents people have to fill out. 
InfoPath has two main parts: an 'editor' interface, used to make and design forms, and a 'form-filling' interface, used to fill out forms that have been made in InfoPath. For example, if someone had to fill out a timesheet on a regular basis, they could use InfoPath's editor to replicate the timesheet form. Every time they had to fill out the timesheet, they could open the form they made in InfoPath, fill it out using InfoPath's form-fill interface, and then save it as a file for archival and print it out if they ever needed to.
Forms that have been made in InfoPath can be put on SharePoint websites. Forms can also be amended with XPath, Basic, or C# computer code to do mathematics or read from and write to databases.

Parrotfish

Parrotfishes are a group of fishes that used to be thought of as a family ("Scaridae"), but now are usuaully considered a subfamily ("Scarinae") of the wrasses. They live in shallow tropical and subtropical oceans around the world. Their numbers are largest in the Indo-Pacific region. They mostly live in coral reefs and seagrass beds. They take an important part in bioerosion. There are about 90 species of parrotfish living today.
Parrotfish are very colourful. Their name comes from the parrot-like beak formed by their teeth. The buccal cavity (cheek) of the parrotfish secretes the 'sleeping sack' that the fish sleeps in overnight. It is a semi-translucent sack which completely surrounds the parrot fish. In the morning the sack is discarded. You can see these on the sea bed floor during the following day.

The Phantom of the Opera (1925 movie)

The Phantom of the Opera (1925) is a silent horror movie. It is based on a novel of the same name by Gaston Leroux. The movie was directed by Rupert Julian. It stars Lon Chaney as the Phantom and Mary Philbin as his love, Christine. The movie is famous for Chaney's horrific, self-applied make-up. 
The story is about a disfigured man named Erik who haunts the Paris Opera. He wants the managers to make the woman he loves, named Christine, a star. In order to do this, he terrorizes everyone by doing things such as dropping a chandelier and wearing a scary disguise in the middle of a large party. When he learns that Christine is in love with a man named Raoul, he kidnaps her. Raoul eventually rescues her, and a group of angry people chase the Phantom until he falls into the Seine river.
The movie was a great success. The critics liked it. Executives at Universal Pictures were pleased. They put a string of horror movies into production. These movies included Bela Lugosi's "Dracula" and Boris Karloff's "Frankenstein". "Phantom" was chosen for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.
Two major versions of the film survive today. The original film (today) comes from bad quality "show at home" film prints which are entirely black and white. The more common version is a 1929 silent version using different takes and camera angles. The 1929 silent version exists because of a lost 1929 sound version in which new scenes were shot in sound.

"Over the Rainbow" is a song from the movie "The Wizard of Oz". It was composed by Harold Arlen and the lyrics were written by E.Y. Harburg. Judy Garland sang the song in the movie. Over time it would become her signature song. The song won an Academy Award. The song is also known as "Somewhere Over the Rainbow". 
About five minutes into the movie, Judy Garland (as Dorothy Gale) sings "Over the Rainbow". She is trying to get her aunt and uncle to listen to her story about an incident involving her dog, Toto. Dorothy's Aunt Em tells her to "find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble". Dorothy walks off with Toto. She says to the dog, "Someplace where there isn't any trouble. Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto? There must be. It's not a place you can get to by a boat, or a train. It's far, far away. Behind the moon, beyond the rain." She begins to sing the song. 
MGM executives thought the song "slowed down the picture". They said it did not sound like a song a little girl would sing in a barnyard. They wanted to cut it from the movie. Other people wanted the song to be kept in the movie. The executives changed their minds and the song was kept. 
"Over the Rainbow" was going to be sung again by Garland in the scene where she is locked in the witch's room and watches the hourglass. She weeps through the song, and ends with "I'm frightened, Auntie Em! I'm frightened!". The song was cut from the scene. The "I'm frightened" cry was kept in the movie.
The song is number one on the "Songs of the Century" list compiled by the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts. The American Film Institute has ranked "Over the Rainbow" as the greatest movie song of all time on the list of "AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs". American troops in Europe in World War II adopted the song as a symbol of the United States. Garland performed the song for American troops as part of a 1943 command performance.

The Terminator is an American action-science fiction motion picture. It is set in Los Angeles, California and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton. This movie was directed by James Cameron and was released on October 26, 1984 in the United States by Orion Pictures. Its budget was $6.4 million and it grossed $78.3 million at the box office.
It was followed by sequels ', ' and "Terminator Salvation".
In 1984 Los Angeles, a cyborg assassin known as a Terminator arrives from 2029 and steals guns and clothes. Shortly afterwards, Kyle Reese, a human soldier, also arrives. He steals clothes from a homeless man and evades the police. The Terminator begins systematically killing women named Sarah Connor, whose addresses he finds in the telephone directory. He tracks the third Sarah Connor to a nightclub, but Kyle rescues her. The two steal a car and escape with the Terminator pursuing them in a police car.
As they hide in a parking lot, Kyle explains to Sarah that an artificial intelligence defense network, known as Skynet, will become self-aware in the near future and initiate a nuclear holocaust. Sarah's future son John will rally the survivors and lead a resistance movement against Skynet and its army of machines. With the Resistance on the verge of victory, Skynet sent a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John is born, to prevent the formation of the Resistance. The Terminator is an efficient killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton and an external layer of living tissue that makes him appear human.
Kyle and Sarah are apprehended by the police after another encounter with the Terminator. Criminal psychologist Dr. Silberman concludes that Kyle is paranoid and delusional. The Terminator repairs his body and attacks the police station, killing many police officers in his attempt to locate Sarah. Kyle and Sarah escape and take refuge in a motel, where they assemble pipe bombs and plan their next move. Kyle admits that he has been in love with Sarah since John gave him a photograph of her, and they have sex.
The Terminator discovers their location, and they attempt to escape in a pickup truck. In the ensuing chase, Kyle is wounded by gunfire while throwing pipe bombs at the Terminator. Enraged‚ Sarah knocks the Terminator off his motorcycle but loses control of the truck, which flips over. The Terminator hijacks a tank truck and attempts to run down Sarah, but Kyle slides a pipe bomb onto the tanker, causing an explosion that burns the flesh from the Terminator's exoskeleton. It pursues them to a factory, where Kyle activates machinery to confuse the Terminator. He jams his final pipe bomb into the Terminator's abdomen, blowing the Terminator apart, injuring Sarah, and killing Kyle. The damaged Terminator reactivates and grabs Sarah. She breaks free and lures it into a hydraulic press, crushing it.
Months later, a pregnant Sarah is traveling through Mexico, recording audio tapes to pass on to her unborn son, John. She debates whether to tell him that Kyle is his father. At a gas station, a boy takes a Polaroid photograph of her which she purchases—the same photograph that John will eventually give to Kyle.

Sport in Japan

Sports in Japan are a part of Japanese culture. Japan has many traditional sports such as sumo, judo, karate, and kendo. Also, there are sports which were imported from the West such as baseball, soccer, golf and skiing. Sports are popular with both participants and onlookers.
Some traditional sports like "yabusame" have ancient histories. 
In the Meiji period, sports which were imported from the West became popular.
Another popular spectator sport is professional wrestling, locally known as "puroresu" (プロレス). While the sport was known in Japan before World War II, it did not become widely popular until the rise of Rikidōzan, considered the "father" of puroresu, in the 1950s. While similar to professional wrestling in the rest of the world in that winners are decided before the match, puroresu has become a unique style. Most match storylines play up the wrestlers' "fighting spirit". Also, because many Japanese wrestlers have martial arts backgrounds, most strikes during matches make full contact. Puroresu also enjoys close ties to mixed martial arts, with some companies often holding wrestling matches and MMA fights in the same event; because of this, both wrestlers and fans treat puroresu as a combat sport.
At first, Western sports were valued as a form of mental discipline, but they have become recreational activities.
Notable athletes, sports clubs, sports schools and training clinics played an important part in spreading sports in Japan. 
In Japan, sports groups are an important part of school life. The time spent in these groups allows students to adjust to Japan's vertical society. For example, in sports, players learn to use "keigo" (formal, polite speech), respect and traditions.
The 1940 Summer Olympics and the 1940 Winter Olympics were planned for Japan, but the organizers withdrew in 1938 because of the Second Sino-Japanese War. These games were later cancelled because of World War II.
Japan did host the Olympic games three times, and has been confirmed as host for a fourth Olympics:

Siamese (cat)

The 'Siamese' is a breed of cat from Thailand. It is a well-known cat, especially for its blue eyes and brown face, ears, tail and paws, although not all of them look like this. In Thailand, it is a native breed, and they are called "Wichian Mat" (), which means "moon diamond". There are two different types of Siamese Cat, the Traditional or Thai Siamese, and the Modern Siamese.
The fur on all Siamese cats has the same sort of pattern, known as point coloration. This is when an animal has a pale body and a dark face, ears, feet and tail.
The Traditional Siamese has a few features that are the same as the Modern Siamese, like the colour pattern and the short fur, but it is different because of its head and body shape. It has long legs, and is thin and is graceful. It has a wedge shaped head and muzzle, and round cheeks. The ears are large and high. The eyes are between medium and large, and have the shape of an almond.
The body of a Modern Siamese is flexible and well-muscled. Its head is in the shape of a triangle, with a thin snout-like muzzle. Their eyes are also almond shaped, and their ears are tall and sit more on the side of the head than the Traditional Siamese. It's neck and tail are long and thin.
Siamese cats, both Traditional and Modern, are usually very friendly and loving cats, and will enjoy spending time with you, although this depends on the cat. They are known to bond to one person. They are also very smart, more so than some other cats. Some Siamese cat's enjoy 'talking', which has been said to sound like a human baby, and are always want attention. Siamese cat's love to play and run around as if they were kittens all their life.
Unlike most cats, they are less active at night, and prefer to sleep through it. This might be because their eyes lack something called tapetum lucidum, which allows cats to see better in the dark. Also, unlike many other blue-eyed cats, Siamese cats can still hear well. Cats that are white with blue eyes are often deaf.

The Sheik (1921 movie)

The Sheik is a 1921 silent movie. It was directed by George Melford. It stars Rudolph Valentino. The movie was based on the book "The Sheik" by Edith Maude Hull. The movie is about a British lady who is captured by an Arab chieftain (a sheik). She is held in his camp, and grows to love him. "The Sheik" made Valentino a superstar. Reviews were mixed. Some critics liked the movie. Some did not. Women loved it. Most men did not like it. They either walked out or stayed away.
Lady Diana Mayo is headstrong and independent. Against her brother's advice, she plans a trip into the desert with only native guides. That night Diana sneaks into an 'Arabs Only' casino wearing a dancer's costume. The Sheik is there. He discovers she is white. He is amused, but sends her away. He learns that she is taking a trip into the desert the next day. He sneaks into her room and tampers with the bullets in her revolver. Later, the Sheik and his men find Diana riding alone. She tries to flee while shooting at the Sheik. He easily captures her. He takes her to his camp. He orders her about. He tells her she will learn to love him. He wants to raping her, but decides against it.
The Sheik receives a visit from his friend, Raoul St. Hubert. Raoul befriends Diana. He chides the Sheik for treating her roughly. Diana gradually warms to the Sheik. She is allowed to go into the desert with his servant. She escapes. She sees a caravan. It belongs to the bandit Omair. The Sheik and his men reach her just in time. The Sheik is in love with Diana. He allows her to ride out again with his servant. She writes "I love you" in the sand. Omair captures her.
The Sheik gathers his men to attack Omair's camp. Omair tries to rape Diana. The Sheik and his men rush in. The Sheik kills Omair, but he is injured. Diana discovers that the Sheik is not an Arab. His father was British and his mother Spanish. They died in the desert. Their child was raised by the old Sheik. When the old man died, the Sheik returned to rule the tribe. The Sheik recovers from his injury. Diana confesses her love.
Reviews were mixed. Many critics felt the toned-down rape scene ruined the original message. It was a great success with audiences however. Attendance records were broken. One newspaper estimated that 125,000 people had seen the movie in its first weeks. Producer Lasky declared the last week of November 1921 'The Sheik Week'. He had the movie open in 250 theatres across the United States on 20 November. The movie ran for six months in Sydney, Australia. It ran for 42 weeks in one theatre in France. It was the first Valentino movie to show in his native Italy. Within the first year, "The Sheik" made more than $1 million. The film cost $200,000 to make.
Female moviegoers loved Valentino. Male moviegoers loathed him. Men refused to see the movie. If they did, they laughed at the love scenes. Men walked out during the movie. They felt threatened by Valentino's style of lovemaking. Many called him effeminate for the long robes he wore in the movie. Dick Dorgan harshly criticized Valetino in the magazine "Photoplay". He thought Valentino was too pretty for a male. He even wrote a song about Valentino called "A Song of Hate!"

A Daughter of the Congo

A Daughter of the Congo is a 1930 silent movie. It is a race movie. It was completely produced by blacks and intended for a black audience. It was written, directed, and produced by Oscar Micheaux. The movie is based on Henry Francis Downing's novel "The American Cavalryman" (1917). "A Daughter of the Congo" is presumed to be a lost film. 
The movie stars Katherine Noisette as Lupelta, a mixed race Congolese girl. She is abducted by Arab slave traders. She is rescued by an African American military battalion. She is taken to a mission school. She becomes acquainted with Western-style civilization. She never completely loses touch with the tribal customs and influences that shaped her early years.
"A Daughter of the Congo" was Micheaux's last silent movie. Silent movies were considered to have little money-making value in 1930. Micheaux released the movie as a “talking, singing, dancing picture”. It only contained a single short sound sequence that included a performance of the song “That Gets It”. 
Theophilus Lewis of the "Amsterdam News" wrote a harsh review: "The scene is laid in a not so mythical republic in Africa. Half of the characters wear European clothes and are supposed to be civilized, while the other half wear their birthday suits and some feathers and are supposed to be savages. All the noble characters are high yellows; all the ignoble ones are black. It is based on a false assumption that has no connection with the realities of life."

Oscar Micheaux

Oscar Devereaux Micheaux (2 January 1884 – 25 March 1951) was an American writer, movie director and independent producer of more than 44 movies. He is regarded as the first major African-American moviemaker, and the most successful African-American moviemaker of the first half of the twentieth century. Micheaux was the most prominent producer of race movies. He produced both silent movies and "talkies".
Micheaux was born to former slaves on January 2, 1884, in Metropolis, Illinois. He passed most of his early years in Great Bend, Kansas. He moved to Chicago when he was 17. He worked as a Pullman porter (railroad baggage handler). In 1906, he bought land in South Dakota. He homesteaded among white neighbors for eight years.
He began to write stories. In 1913, he self-published his first novel, "The Conquest: The Story of a Negro Pioneer". In 1915, he had money troubles and lost his land. He moved to Sioux City, Iowa where he ran his own publishing company. In 1917, he rewrote "The Conquest" and published it as "The Homesteader". He sold the book door-to-door in small towns.
An African American movie company wanted to make a movie of "The Homesteader". The company however did not want Micheaux to direct it. They would not agree to a budget that met his expectations. The deal was dropped.
Micheaux then turned his publishing company into the Micheaux Film and Book Company. He sold stock in the company to raise money for his own movie of "The Homesteader", and shooting began. It was the first feature-length movie made by an African American. It was released in Chicago in 1919, and was a great success.
Micheaux's second movie was "Within Our Gates". This was his response to D. W. Griffith's "Birth of a Nation". Griffith's movie was about the Ku Klux Klan. It was one of the most popular movies of the day. The movie challenged Griffith's message by showing that whites were more likely to harm blacks than the other way around.
Micheaux would make more than 40 movies over the next 30 years. In 1931, his movie "The Exile" became the first full-length sound feature by an African American. His last movie "The Betrayal" (1948) was the first movie produced by an African American­ to open in white theaters.
Micheaux died on 25 March 1951 in Charlotte, North Carolina. He is buried in the Great Bend Cemetery in Great Bend, Kansas. His gravestone reads, "A Man Ahead of His Time."
In 1986, the Directors Guild of America posthumously granted Micheaux the Golden Jubilee Special Directorial Award. In 1987, he received a star on Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of Fame.

<doc id="329455" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=329455" title="Doge's Palace, Venice">
Doge's Palace, Venice

The Doge's Palace () is a gothic palace in Venice, northern Italy. The palace was the home of the Doge of Venice, the ruler of the Republic of Venice In 1923 the palace became a museum, one of 11 museums run by the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia. In 2010 it was visited by 1,358,186 people.
In 810, Doge Angelo Partecipazio moved the government from the island of Malamocco to the Rialto. The first palace was destroyed by a fire in the 10th century, which is in the 900s. A second palace was started by Doge Sebastiano Ziani (1172–1178). There are still parts of this building which can be seen on the ground floor, including stone wall bases and some brick paving. As Venice grew, the palace needed to be rebuilt to meet new demands. For example, changes in the political structure meant there were many more members of the Great Council. 
This third palace, in Gothic style, was started about 1340. The first section was on the side facing the lagoon. In 1424 Doge Francesco Foscari built the wing overlooking the Piazzetta. This new building was for the law-courts, with a ground floor arcade on the outside. The first floor had open loggias running along the facade. When the Porta della Carta was built in 1442, it made an internal courtyard. 
In 1483, a fire destroyed the Doge's residence which was in the part of the palace overlooking the canal. Architect Antonio Rizzo used the new Renaissance style for the building's architecture. A new building was built alongside the canal, stretching from the ponte della Canonica to the Ponte della Paglia. The official rooms of the government had art works specially made by Vittore Carpaccio, Giorgione, Alvise Vivarini and Giovanni Bellini. A fire in 1547 destroyed some rooms on the second floor. A big fire in 1577 destroyed the Scrutinio Room and the Great Council Chamber. Art work by Gentile da Fabriano, Pisanello, Alvise Vivarini, Vittore Carpaccio, Giovanni Bellini, Pordenone, and Titian were also lost in the fire. The palace was rebuilt in the original gothic style. Some classical features were added, such as the Bridge of Sighs joining the prison to the palace.
The palace was the home of the government of the Republic of Venice until the Napoleonic occupation of the city in 1797. Venice was ruled by the French, then Austria, and in 1866 it became part of Italy. During this time, the palace was used for various government offices, the Biblioteca Marciana and other important cultural institutions within the city.
By the end of the 19th century, the building was showing clear signs of decay. The Italian government spent a lot of money to repair the building. All public offices were moved elsewhere, except the State Office for the protection of historical Monuments, which is still housed at the palace's loggia floor. In 1923, the municipality of Venice set up the palace as a museum. In 1996, the Doge’s Palace has been part of the Venetian museums network, which is run by the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia since 2008.
The oldest part of the palace is the facade overlooking the lagoon. The corners of the building have 14th century sculptures by Filippo Calendario, Raverti and Antonio Bregno. The ground floor arcade and the loggia has 14th and 15th century capitals. Some of these are copies made during the 19th century.
The Porta della Carta, was the grand entrance to the building. The gateway was built and decorated by Giovanni and Bartolomeo Bon from 1438–1442. The name Porta della Carta could be because this was the area where public scribes set up their desks, or from the "cartabum", where all the important government documents were kept. On either side of the gateway are two gothic towers, with sculptures of the "Cardinal Virtues". On the top is a bust of St. Mark, and over him is a statue of "Justice" with her symbols of sword and scales. In the space above the cornice, there is a sculpture of the Doge Francesco Foscari kneeling before the St. Mark's Lion. This is was made in the 19th century by Luigi Ferrrari, to replace the original destroyed in 1797.
The public entrance to the Doge's Palace is now through the Porta del Frumento, in the waterfront side of the building.
The north side of the courtyard is made by the palace and St. Mark’s Basilica, which used to be the Doge’s chapel. At the center of the courtyard are two well-heads built in the mid-16th century.
In 1485 a grand staircase was built within the courtyard. Linked to the Porta della Carta, it created a monumental approach from the Piazza into the heart of the building. Since 1567, the Giants’ Staircase has been guarded by Sansovino’s two huge statues of "Mars" and "Neptune". These show Venice’s power by land and by sea, and therefore the reason for its name. Members of the Senate gathered before government meetings in the Senator’s Courtyard, to the right of the Giants’ Staircase.

Leslie Orgel

Leslie Eleazer Orgel FRS (12 January 1927 – 27 October 2007) was a British chemist.
Born in London, Orgel received his B.A. and Ph.D in chemistry at Magdalen College, Oxford University. 
He was one of the first people to see, in April 1953, Crick and Watson's model of DNA: at the time he worked at Oxford University's Chemistry Department.
In 1964 Orgel was appointed Senior Fellow and Research Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he directed the Chemical Evolution Laboratory. He was also an adjunct professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego, and he was one of five principal investigators in the NASA-sponsored NSCORT program in exobiology. Orgel also participated in NASA's Viking Mars Lander Program as a member of the Molecular Analysis Team that designed the gas chromatography mass spectrometer instrument that robots took to the planet Mars.
Orgel’s lab came across an economical way to make cytarabine, a compound that is one of today’s most commonly used anti-cancer agents.
During the 1970s, Orgel suggested reconsidering the panspermia hypothesis, according to which the earliest forms of life on earth did not originate here, but arrived from outer space with meteorites.
Together with Stanley Miller, Orgel also suggested that peptide nucleic acids – rather than ribonucleic acids – constituted the first pre-biotic systems capable of self-replication on early Earth.
His name is popularly known because of Orgel's rules, credited to him, particularly Orgel's Second Rule: "Evolution is cleverer than you are".
In his book "The Origins of Life", Orgel coined the concept of specified complexity, to describe the criterion by which living organisms are distinguished from non-living matter. He published over three hundred articles in his research areas. 
Orgel died of cancer on 27 October 2007 at the San Diego Hospice & Palliative Care in San Diego, California.

LGBT rights in Azerbaijan

2000 saw the abolishment of the Azerbaijani law forbidding homosexual interactions (gay sex). A special edition of "Azerbaijan", the official newspaper of the Parliament, published on 28 May, reported that the Parliament had approved a new Criminal Code, and that the President had signed a decree bringing it into force in September. The text of the new Criminal Code was also published. From this it is clear that the old Article 113 (inherited from the Soviet era, and which punished anal sex between men with three years imprisonment) has been replaced with a new Article 150, which bans only forcible sexual acts.
When Azerbaijan became part of USSR, despite in Lenin-era of Soviet Russia homosexuality was not banned, it remained as crime in Azerbaijan. As the homosexuality was most widespread in Azerbaijan, Turkmenia, Uzbekistan and Georgia, the legislation on persecution of homosexuals remained in force in 1920's.
After the independence of Azerbaijan in 1991, homosexual acts were legalized in 2000. The official newspaper of the Parliament, published on 28 May 2000, reported that the Parliament had approved a new criminal code, and that the President had signed a decree bringing it into force in September. The old Article 113 (inherited from the Soviet era, and which punished anal sex between men with three years imprisonment) has been replaced with a new Article 150, which bans only forcible sexual acts.
Although homosexual acts between consenting male adults were officially decriminalized, reports about police abuses against gays, mainly male prostitutes, persisted during the last year. While complaining of the violence against them, the victims preferred to remain anonymous fearing retaliation on the part of police." (2001 Report of the International Helsinki Federation).

Chrissie Maher, OBE (born 1938) is a British advocate for the use of plain English. She is a co-founder of the Plain English Campaign. This organisation promotes the clear use of English, especially by businesses and official bodies. Her campaign began in 1971 when she founded the United Kingdom's first community newspaper, the "Tuebrook Bugle". That gave her the chance to write articles saying that organisations should start using plain English. In 1974, Maher went on to start "The Liverpool News". It was the UK's first newspaper for adults with reading difficulties. She was also a member of the UK's National Consumer Council. Later, she founded the Plain English Campaign at a demonstration in London in 1979.
As an example of the language issues Maher found objectionable: in 1994, she pointed out that Britain's National Health Service published a definition of the term "bed" that used 229 words. 
For her efforts, Maher was awarded the OBE in 1993. In 1995, she was awarded an honorary MA degree by Manchester University. In 1997 she received an honorary doctorate from the Open University. In 2000, Maher was named "Information Pioneer of the Century" by the UK's National Information Forum. In 2010, Maher received an Honorary Fellowship from Liverpool John Moores University for her services to communication. 
Also in 2010 Maher was selected Public Affairs Achiever of the Year and Outstanding Achiever of the Year for the ‘Women in Public Life’ awards. 
Tom McArthur, editor of the "Oxford Companion to the English Language" said, "In all the history of the language, there has never been such a powerful grassroots movement to influence it as the Plain English Campaign."

Synapomorphy

A synapomorphy is a common character. It is a term in cladistics, meaning a trait which is present in two or more species by common descent. It is a type of homologous character or homology.
More precisely, it is shared by two or more taxa and their most recent common ancestor, whose own ancestor in turn does not possess the trait. Thus, it is not just an ancestral trait, but a recently evolved distinguishing trait. It helps to distinguish between two trees of descent which would otherwise be equally likely.

Blue Danube Waltz

On the Beautiful Blue Danube, Op. 314 is a waltz composed by Johann Strauss II in 1867 for the Vienna Men's Singing Society. It was written for four-part choir with orchestra or piano. The words were written by Josef Weyl. It was first performed on 15 February 1867 by the Vienna Men's Singing Society and the orchestra of the Forty-Second Infantry Regiment directed by Rudolph Weinwurm. It was performed without voices on March 4 and again on March 10 in the same format at a benefit for Strauss's brothers. It was a sensation when performed at the Paris Exposition the same year. This performance marked the beginning of Strauss's international reputation. The waltz was published in 1867 by Carl Anton Spina. 
The piece begins with a slow introduction in the dominant key of A major. This introduction is followed by five small waltzes of two sections each. Melodies with large leaps are contrasted with linear melodies composed within a narrow range. The coda touches on the various melodies and concludes with a lively finish. The waltz was first played in the United States in its instrumental version on 1 July 1867 in New York. It was first played in Great Britain on 21 September 1867 in London at the promenade concerts in Covent Garden. The instrumental version is usually performed today. On New Year's Eve in Vienna, the waltz is broadcast on television and radio stations at midnight. It is an encore piece at the Vienna New Year's Day Concert.

Segmentation

Segmentation in biology means the division of some animal and plant bodies into a series of repeat sections or parts. It is common in some of the most successful groups of animals, such as arthropods, vertebrates and annelid worms. 
Segmentation of the body allows different regions of the body to develop for different uses.
We now know a good deal about how the development of segmented animals is controlled. In a series of experiments with the fruit-fly "Drosophila", E.B. Lewis was able to identify a complex of genes whose proteins bind to the regulatory regions of target genes. The latter then activate or repress cell processes which direct the final development of the organism. 
Furthermore, the sequence of these control genes show "co-linearity": the order of the loci in the chromosome parallels the order in which the loci are expressed along the anterior-posterior axis of the body. Not only that, but this cluster of master control genes programs the development of all higher organisms. 
Each of the genes contains a homeobox, a remarkably conserved DNA sequence. This suggests the complex itself arose by gene duplication. 
In his Nobel lecture, Lewis said "Ultimately, comparisons of the [control complexes] throughout the animal kingdom should provide a picture of how the organisms, as well as the [control genes] have evolved".

Ensemble

An ensemble is a group of people who work or perform together. By extension, it can mean a coordinated outfit of clothing, or anything where a group contributes to a coordinated whole.
The term is most used in music. A musical ensemble is a group of people who perform instrumental or vocal music. In classical music, trios or quartets often group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles or wind ensembles. The term is also used in jazz, where the instruments typically include wind instruments.
An ensemble usually consists of three or four people with similar skill levels. The word originated in late middle English (as an adverb) meaning "at the same time". It is from French, based on the Latin "insimul". The noun dates from the mid 18th century.

Monmouthpedia will use QRpedia codes, a type of bar code a smartphone can read.
We aim to have 1,000 QRpedia codes in Monmouth by April. If you think you can help, contact info@wikimedia.org.uk.
We are very keen for local people to be involved however they wish. Computer skills are not important, it’s the interest and the willingness to be involved. If you speak another language it would be a great place to learn new vocabulary. 
By the end of April, we want the community in Monmouth to see something that they - and people around the world - helped build. We've created a competition, to rewards contributors, they are unique prizes not available anywhere else.
To arrange a session to learn how to edit Wikipedia and uploading images contact john.cummings@monmouthpedia.org there is a scanner available for scanning photographs and documents
Wikipedia group editing days (learn how to edit with other people and swap ideas)
We have had at the end of December 2011 and through to the new year and had over 18,000 page views in the last week of December.

Ternary form

Ternary form is a musical form. It is also called song form or minuet and trio. These forms all have three distinct sections. The three sections are written in shorthand as ABA. The music in the A sections is the same, or very nearly the same. The music in the B section is different from the A sections. The B section usually provides some sort of musical contrast to the A sections. It may be composed in a different but related key, for example. The B section is often called the "trio", especially in minuets, scherzi, marches, polonaises, etc. The B section came to be called the "trio" because a Baroque composer consistently scored this section in his minuets for three instruments.

Staffa

Staffa is an island in the Inner Hebrides off the north-west of Scotland. It is famous for Fingal's Cave and other examples of basalt columns. No-one lives there.
The islands became part of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, the "Suðreyjar" kingdom of the Norse. The Norsemen ruled for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266. The islands were then held by the Clans MacLeod and MacDonald, but Staffa was not regularly inhabited.
This small island is entirely of volcanic origin. It consists of a basement of tuff, underneath colonnades of a black fine-grained Tertiary basalt, overlying which is a third layer of basalt lava. Slow cooling of the second layer of basalt resulted in an extraordinary pattern of hexagonal columns which form the faces and walls of the principal caves. The lava contracted as it cooled and solidified into columns, a process known as columnar jointing.
The columns have three to eight sides, six being most common. The columns are also divided horizontally by cross joints. Similar formations are found at the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, on the island of Ulva and Ardmeanach on the Isle of Mull. The 'Staffa Group' is the name given to the series of olivine basalts found in and around Mull. The volcanic eruptions took place 55–58 million years ago.

Mud bogging (sometimes called mud racing, mud running, mud drags, or mudding) is a type of off-road motorsport. It is popular in Canada and the United States. The goal of mud bogging is to drive a vehicle through a pit of mud. Winners are decided by the distance they get through the pit. However, if several vehicles are able to travel the entire length, the time taken to go through the pit will decide the winner. Usually, vehicles competing in mud bogs are four-wheel drives. The motor sport is managed by groups like the "American Mud Racing Association". and the "National Mud Racing Organization (NMRO)".

Monticello

Monticello was the home of President Thomas Jefferson. It is near Charlottesville, Virginia. It is now a National Historic Landmark. 
It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Jefferson designed the house based on the principles of Andrea Palladio. Construction began in 1768. Jefferson moved in two years later. He remodelled the house after picking up ideas in Europe. The house is located on a peak in the Southwest Mountains. Its name is Italian for "Little Mountain". Slave quarters were located 300 feet south of the house on Mulberry Row. These quarters were occupied by slaves working in the house. The slaves working in the fields lived in another place. A cabin on Mulberry Row was once the home of Sally Hemings. She was a slave who had a long relationship with Jefferson after his wife died. She gave birth to six of his children. An image of the house has appeared on the United States nickel and on the two-dollar bill. Monticello became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. It has been owned and operated by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation since 1923.

Fermionic condensate

A fermionic condensate, or fermi condensate, is a state of matter (superfluid phase) which is very similar to the Bose–Einstein condensate. Superfluids are also Bose-Einstein condensates. 
The only difference is that Bose-Einstein condensates are made up of bosons, and are social with each other (in groups, or clumps). Fermi condensates are anti-social (they don't attract each other at all). This has to be done artificially.
This state of matter was made in December 2003 by Deborah Jin and her group. Jin worked for the National Institute of Standards and Technology at the University of Colorado. Her team created this state of matter by cooling a cloud of potassium-40 atoms to less than a millionth°C over absolute zero (-273.15°C, this is the hypothetical lowest limit of physical temperatures). This is the same temperature required to cool matter to a Bose–Einstein condensate. The process of cooling a gas into a condensate is called condensation. 
Bosons and fermions are subatomic particles (bits of matter smaller than an atom). The difference between a boson and a fermion is the number of the atom's electrons, neutrons and/or protons. An atom is composed of bosons if it has an even number of electrons. An atom is composed of fermions if it has an odd number of electrons, neutrons and protons. An example of a boson would be a gluon. An example of a fermion would be potassium-40, which is what Deborah Jin used as the gas cloud. Bosons are can form clumps and are attracted to each other, whereas fermions do not form clumps. Fermions are usually found in straight strings because they repel each other. This is so, because fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that they cannot gather together in the same quantum state.
Like the Bose–Einstein condensates, fermi condensates will coalesce (grow together into one entity) with the particles that make them up. Bose–Einstein condensates and fermi condensates are also both man-made states of matter. The particles that make these states of matter have to be artificially super-cooled, to have the properties that they do. However, fermi condensates have reached even lower temperatures than Bose–Einstein condensates. Also, both states of matter have no viscosity, which means that they can flow without stopping.
Creating a fermi condensate is very difficult. Fermions obey the exclusion principle, and they are not attracted to each other. They repel each other. Jin and her research team found a way to merge them together. They adjusted and applied a magnetic field on the anti-social fermions, so they began losing their properties. The fermions still kept some of their character, but behaved a bit like bosons. Using this, they were able to make separate pairs of fermions merge with each other over and over again. Mrs. Jin suspects that this pairing process is the same in Helium-3, also a superfluid. Based on this information, they can hypothesize (make an educated guess) that fermionic condensates will flow without any viscosity as well. 
Another related phenomenon is superconductivity. In superconductivity, paired electrons can flow with 0 viscosity. There is quite some interest in superconductivity, as it may be a cheaper and cleaner source of electricity. It could also be used to power levitating trains and hover-cars. 
But this can only happen if scientists can create or discover materials that are superconductors at room temperature. In fact, a Nobel Prize will be awarded to one who succeeds in making a room temperature superconductor. Right now, the problem is that scientists have to work with superconductors at around -135°C. This involves the use of liquid nitrogen and other methods to make extremely cold temperatures. This is of course a tedious job, which is why scientists prefer to use superconductors at room temperature. Mrs. Jin's team thinks that replacing the paired electrons with the paired fermions would result in a room-temperature superconductor.

Evangeline

Evangeline, A Tale of Acadie is a long poem. It was written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. It was published in 1847. The poem is about a girl named Evangeline. She searches for her lost love Gabriel. Longfellow got the idea for the poem from his friend Nathaniel Hawthorne. He modelled the poem on the Greek and Roman classics. "Evangeline" is one of Longfellow's most popular works.
Evangeline is a girl of Acadie, a place in Canada. She is engaged to Gabriel. They are separated when the British deport the Acadians from Acadie in the Great Upheaval. She searches for him across America. This takes many years. Sometimes she is close to him without knowing he is near. Finally she settles in Philadelphia. She grows old. She works as a Sister of Mercy among the poor. She tends the dying during an epidemic. She finds Gabriel among the sick. He dies in her arms.

"The Wreck of the Hesperus" is a poem. It was written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. It was published in 1842 in Longfellow's book, "Ballads and Other Poems". His inspiration for the poem was a bad storm in 1839. The storm destroyed 20 ships and killed 40 people. A dead woman was found in the sea tied to a mast.
A proud sea captain takes his little daughter aboard his ship to keep him company. A seaman warns him a storm is approaching. He does not pay attention to this seaman. The storm hits. The captain ties his daughter to the mast. He does not want her to be swept overboard. She calls out to her dying father. She hears the waves beating on the shore. She prays to Christ to calm the seas. The ship crashes onto a reef and sinks. The next morning a fisherman finds the daughter's dead body in the sea. It is still tied to the mast.

The common pipistrelle, "Pipistrellus pipistrellus", is a small bat with a very large range across most of Europe, North Africa, southwestern Asia, and possibly into Korea. It is one of the most common bat species in the British Isles.
It is 3.5–4.5 cm long with a wingspan of 19–25 cm, with brown fur. It is common in woodland and farmland but is also found in towns, where it roosts in lofts and buildings.
In 1999 the common pipistrelle was split into two species on the basis of different-frequency echolocation calls. The common pipistrelle uses a call of 45 kHz, while the soprano pipistrelle echo-locates at 55 kHz. Since then other differences, in appearance, habitat and food, have also been found.
The frequencies used by this bat species for echolocation lie between 45–76 kHz, have most energy at 47 kHz and have an average duration of 5.6 ms.

Pitaya fruit, pitahaya fruit, commonly known as the dragon fruit, is a fruit from Central America, South America, and Asia. It is a favorite to many, particularly people of Asian origin. It has a light sweet taste, an intense shape and color, and has a texture of between that of a kiwi and an apple. In addition to being tasty and refreshing, this contains a lot of water and other vital minerals with varied nutritional ingredients.
Dragon fruit has a number of health benefits including its ability to lower cholesterol, boost the immune system, prevent cancer and heart disease, aid in weight loss, improve digestion, boost energy, defend against bacteria and fungi, and help in the overall functioning of the body’s systems.
Dragon fruit is an exotic and delicious fruit which is often considered a tropical “superfood” because of its wealth of benefits, and its somewhat “under the radar” quality that makes it less well known than many mainstream fruits and health foods. It is also known as “pitaya” if it comes from the very closely related Stenocereus genus, but the actual Dragon Fruit is the fruit of the cactus genus Hylocereus. It has its origins in Mexico, South America, and Central America, but New World settlers probably brought it to Southeast Asian nations like Cambodia, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Philippines, where it remains an important part of the dietary fruit intake.

Tales of a Wayside Inn is a book of poems by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. It was published in 1863. The book is set in a real place. That place was a tavern in Sudbury, Massachusetts. Longfellow lived 20 miles away in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The inn was a favorite place for the people of Cambridge to go. The people in the book were real people, too. They were friends of Longfellow. In the book, they tell stories to each other while visitng the Wayside Inn. The best known poem is "Paul Revere's Ride". It begins: "Listen my children and you shall hear / Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere."
Longfellow wrote the book to help him cope with his wife's death. She died at home. She was standing in front of a fireplace. Her skirt caught fire. Longfellow visited the real tavern in 1862. It was called the Red Horse Tavern at that time. It was closed because the owner had died the year before. Longfellow said it was "a rambling, tumble-down building". Two more books about the Wayside Inn were published. One book was published in 1870, and other in 1872.

Old North Church (officially, Christ Church in the City of Boston) is a church in Boston, Massachusetts at 193 Salem Street. It was built in 1723. Its design was inspired by the works of Christopher Wren. The church is a parish of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts. It is the oldest standing church building in Boston. Inside the church is a bust of George Washington that the Marquis de Lafayette thought the best likeness of Washington he had ever seen.
The church is known to most Americans because it was here that a lantern signal was sent by sexton Robert Newman from the church steeple on the evening of April 18, 1775 to warn American patriots that British soldiers were approaching Lexington and Concord by sea and not by land. "Paul Revere's Ride", a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, remembers this event. 
The church steeple was damaged by storms in 1804 and 1954. It was rebuilt. It is now 175 feet (53 m) tall. The original weathervane is on top. There are 1100 bodies buried in the basement. Many of these are patriots who were killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Old North Church is a National Historic Landmark. Queen Elizabeth II visited the church in 1976 and was given a silver chalice (a cup) modelled on one made by Paul Revere.

Anangu, Aṉaŋu or Arnangu (pronounced with the stress on the first syllable: ), is a word used to refer to Aboriginal people in Australia. It is found in some dialects of the Western Desert Language (WDL) of western and central Australia.
Before European people arrived in central Australia, the word probably meant 'human being', or 'person'. But now it is used to mean 'Aboriginal person' only. Because other Aboriginal languages have their own words for '(Aboriginal) person' the word "anangu" is mostly used in English to refer to the WDL-speaking people. Used in this way, it is not used to refer to any traditional grouping (or tribe), but to the WDL people as a whole. The correct term for "black person" in Pitjantjatjara is "", literally "dark/black person".
Other Western Desert Language dialects have different words with a similar meaning and many uses. In the far west of the WDL (i.e. amongst Manyjilyjarra, Kartujarra, Putijarra and Warnman) the word "martu" is used, and in the central Western Desert (i.e. amongst the western Pintupi) the word "purntu", although this seems to be rarely used now.
There are a number of other names from Australian Aboriginal languages commonly used to identify groups based on geography:

House of the Seven Gables

The House of the Seven Gables is a historic house in Salem, Massachusetts. It was built for Captain John Turner. It remained in the Turner family for three generations. The earliest section of the house was built in 1668. It faced south towards Salem Harbor. It was a two-room, 2 1⁄2-story house. It had cross-gables and a huge central chimney. This portion now forms the middle of the house. The house was remodelled over the years. It was eventually acquired by the Ingersoll family. Nathaniel Hawthorne often visited his cousin Susannah at the house. He wrote a novel called "The House of the Seven Gables". The book uses the house as background. The house was restored between 1908 and 1910. A "cent-shop" and a secret staircase were added. This was done to please visitors who expected the house to resemble the one in Hawthorne's book. The House of the Seven Gables is the oldest "surviving" mansion house in continental North America. It has 17 rooms and over 8,000 square feet. The house is now a non-profit museum.

<doc id="330046" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=330046" title="Colossus computer">
Colossus computer

Colossus was the world's first programmable electronic digital computer. British codebreakers used Colossus to help to read German coded radio messages during World War II. 
These messages were sent between the German High Command, and Adolf Hitler's top army commanders. Reading these messages helped the Allies to win the war.
Codebreaker Max Newman worked at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park. His problem was how to get a machine that would help turn German coded radio teleprinter messages into ordinary language. A group of Post Office telephone engineers led by Tommy Flowers worked out how to do this. Their design, which was called "Colossus" used many vacuum tubes (valves). The first machine, Mark 1, worked in December 1943. It solved its first problem at Bletchley Park on 5 February 1944. Colossus Mark 2 was even better. It first worked on 1 June 1944, just before the Normandy Landings on D-Day. Ten Colossus computers were in use at the end of the war.
British codebreakers called the teleprinter messages "Fish". The messages had been coded by an unknown German machine. They called the machine and its coded messages "Tunny". Colossus imitated the machine and read the coded message from a punched tape. It tried various possibilities of how two of the wheels had been set up. When Colossus found likely settings for two wheels, the codebreaker designed further programs for Colossus until likely settings of other wheels were found. Colossus did not perform all of the decoding process. It just found likely settings of the machine. The output from Colossus was then worked on by people who had a very good knowledge of the German language.
It was not until the end of the war that the British codebreakers found out that the code machine was the Lorenz SZ42. After the war all the secret Colossus computers were taken to pieces, so that no one would find out about them. The designs were destroyed. For thirty years no one knew who made the first computers. Between the early 1990s and 2007, a working copy of a Colossus computer was built. This can be seen at The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park in England.
Regular radio transmissions of "Tunny" messages started in June 1941. The British codebreakers saw that it used a five-unit code like a teleprinter system. Their research also showed that the coding was being done by a rotor cipher machine with 12 wheels (rotors). For each new message sent, the wheels had first to be turned to different positions from before. This position was called the start position for the message. It was chosen by the operator who was sending the message. He told the operator who was receiving the message what the start positions were with 12 letters that were not coded. The total number of possible start positions of the 12 wheels was very large indeed. 
The coding machine added together the "plaintext" (the un-coded version of the message) and a stream of characters (letters, numbers, punctuation) called the "keystream" (a stream of seemingly random characters) that it generated to make the "ciphertext" (the coded version of the message). The ciphertext, which made no sense, was transmitted by radio. At the receiving end an identical machine removed the keystream to produce the plaintext of the message.
If the German operators always worked correctly, no two messages would have the same start position of the wheels. However, mistakes were made. They helped the British codebreakers. On 30 August 1941 two versions of the same message, which was nearly 4,000 characters long, were sent with the same wheel start positions. This mistake was very useful to the research codebreakers. A codebreaker called John Tiltman was able to get the keystream from these messages. 
The codebreakers tried to work out the details of the machine from this information, but at first they failed. They were then joined by a young codebreaker called Bill Tutte who was given the job. After a lot of work he succeeded, and produced a logical description of the unseen machine. This work has been described as "the greatest intellectual achievement of world war II". Tutte worked out that the machine made each keystream character by combining the effects of two sets of five wheels. He used Greek letters to name the wheels. He called one set of five the χ ("chi") wheels, and the other set of five the ψ ("psi") wheels. He worked out that the χ wheels moved on one position for each new character coded. The ψ wheels, however, did not move regularly. They only moved on some of the time. Whether or not the ψ wheels moved on was controlled by two wheels that he called two the μ ("mu") or "motor wheels".
Max Newman was a mathematician and codebreaker at Bletchley Park. He was given the job of working out how a machine could break "Tunny" messages. The machine would do a calculation for many possible start positions of the χ wheels. The start position that gave the largest count from this calculation was likely to be the right one. The first machine was called "Heath Robinson". This did not work very well. It had two punched paper tapes that had to work exactly together. One tape contained the ciphertext in a continuous loop. The second looped tape contained patterns made by the wheels of the coding machine. The tapes would often stretch or break when going at 2000 characters each second. Sometimes the tapes would not line up; then the counts were wrong.
Tommy Flowers worked at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill in north-west London. He was asked to look at the Heath Robinson machine. He thought it was a weak machine. He designed an electronic machine to do the same job. It would make the patterns of the coding machine by electronics so that only one paper tape was needed. In February 1943 he showed Max Newman this design. The design needed 1,500 thermionic valves (vacuum tubes). Few people thought that so many valves could work without a lot failing. More Heath Robinson machines were ordered. Flowers, however, kept with the idea of an electronic machine. He got support from the person in charge of the Post Office Research Station who was called Gordon Radley. Tommy Flowers and his team started work on Colossus in February 1943.
The tape with the message on it had to be read at speed. Tommy Flowers tested the tape reader up to 9,700 letters/second () before the tape broke. He selected 5,000 characters each second as a good speed for regular work. This meant that the paper tape moved at or . The electronic circuits were driven by a signal made from reading the sprocket holes of the punched tape. 
The first Colossus worked at Dollis Hill in December 1943. Then they took Colossus apart and moved it to Bletchley Park. It got there on 18 January 1944. Harry Fensom and Don Horwood put it back together. Colossus read its first message on 5 February. After the first Colossus (Mark 1) there were nine Mark 2 machines. These each had 2,400 valves. They were easier too use. They could be programmed to work at five times the speed of the Mark 1. A Mark 2 Colossus fist worked on 1 June 1944. 
At first Colossus was only used to find the starting wheel places used for a message (called "wheel setting"). Codebreakers worked out how to use the Mark 2 to help find the patterns of the cams on the wheels ("wheel breaking"). At the end of the war there were ten Colossus computers working at Bletchley Park. This meant that very many messages were decoded.
Colossus used electronics that were new back then. It used vacuum tubes (also called thermionic valves), thyratrons and photomultipliers. It read a paper tape with light. It then used a programmable logical function on every letter. It counted how often this function was "true". Machines with many valves were known to break a lot. They break most when turning on, so the Colossus machines were only turned off when a part broke.
Colossus was the first of the electronic digital machines that could have a program. It could not change as much as in later machines: 
It was not a general Turing-complete computer, even though Alan Turing was at Bletchley Park. This idea had not yet been invented, and most of the other early modern computing machines were not Turing-complete (for example: the Atanasoff–Berry Computer, the Harvard Mark I electro-mechanical relay machine, the Bell Labs relay machines by George Stibitz and others, or the first designs of Konrad Zuse). The idea of a computer as a general purpose machine—that is, as more than a calculator only for the solution of one hard problem—did not become common for many years.
What the Colossus computers were used for was very secret. The Colossus itself was highly secret even for many years after the War. This is why Colossus could not be included in the history of computing hardware for a long time. Nobody knew how important that Flowers and the other people who helped make it were.
Not many people knew about this secret computer, so it had little direct effect on the new design of later computers; EDVAC was the early design which had the most effect on later computer design.
Once Colossus was made, some people now knew that high-speed electronic (no moving parts like electrical relays) digital computing devices could be made and they did not break too much. Just this knowledge was enough to have a big effect on the designs of early computers in Britain and probably in the US. People who knew about Colossus were important in the early computer field in Britain. In 1972, Herman Goldstine wrote that:
In writing that, Goldstine did not know of Colossus. He did not know what it left to projects of people who knew about it. People such as Alan Turing (with the Pilot ACE and ACE), and Max Newman and I. J. Good (with the Manchester Mark 1 and other early Manchester computers). Brian Randell later wrote that:
Colossus plans and machinery were secret from the when they were made. They stayed so after the War, when Winston Churchill ordered the destruction of most of the Colossus machines into "parts no bigger than a man's hand"; Tommy Flowers himself burned the designs in a fireplace at Dollis Hill. Some parts, changed to look innocent, were taken to Newman's Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at Manchester University. The Colossus Mark 1 was taken apart and the parts were sent back to the Post Office. Two Colossus computers, along with two copied Tunny machines, were kept. They were moved to GCHQ's new head office at Eastcote in April 1946. They moved again with GCHQ to Cheltenham between 1952 and 1954. One of the computers, known as "Colossus Blue", was taken apart in 1959; the other in 1960. In their later years, the computers were used for training. Before that, there had been attempts to change them (sometimes well) for other purposes. Jack Good was the first to use it after the war, getting NSA to use Colossus to do something for which they were planning to build a special purpose machine. Colossus was also used to perform letter counts on one-time pad tape to test for non-randomness.
At this time the Colossus was still secret, long after any of its technical details were of any importance. This was due to the UK's intelligence agencies use of Enigma-like machines which they got other governments to buy. The agencies then broke the codes using different ways. Had the knowledge of the codebreaking machines been widely known, no one would have accepted these machines; rather, they would have developed their own methods for encryption, methods that the UK services might not have been able to break. The need for such secrets slowly went away as communications moved to digital transmission and all-digital encryption systems became common in the 1960s.
Colonel Winterbotham's book "The Ultra Secret" came out in 1975. This broke the secrecy around the Colossus. After that, details about the computer began to become public in the late 1970s.
A 500-page technical report on the Tunny cipher and its code breaking – entitled "General Report on Tunny" – was given by GCHQ to the national Public Record Office in October 2000; the complete technical report is online.
A team led by Tony Sale built a working copy of a Colossus Mark 2. The plans and machines had been destroyed, but a surprising amount of other material was not destroyed. It was mostly in engineers' notebooks, much of it in the U.S. The optical tape reader might have been the biggest problem, but Dr. Arnold Lynch, its designer, was able to redesign it from his own first writings. The rebuilt Colossus is on show at The National Museum of Computing, in H Block Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. This is where the Colossus No. 9 was used in the war.
In November 2007, to mark both the end of the work and the start of fundraising (asking for money) they ran a competition. The money would help The National Museum of Computing with a Cipher Competition where the rebuilt Colossus competed with radio amateurs all around the world. The first to hear and decode three messages enciphered would win. They would be enciphered using the Lorenz SZ42 and transmitted from the radio station in the "Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum" computer museum in Germany. The competition was easily won by radio amateur Joachim Schüth. Schüth had gotten ready for the event. He made his own signal processing and code-breaking program using Ada. The Colossus team lost because they wanted to use World War II radios. They were a day late because of bad radio conditions. The winner's 1.4 GHz laptop, running his own program, took less than a minute to find the settings for all 12 wheels. The German codebreaker said: "My laptop worked on ciphertext at a speed of 1.2 million letters per second—240x faster than Colossus. If you compare the two computers, you could say Colossus had a speed of 5.8 MHz. That is very fast for a computer built in 1944."

Sublime (philosophy)

In philosophy, the term sublime refers to something that is "great". This greatness can be physical, moral, intellectual, metaphysical, aesthetic, spiritual or artistic. Very often, the term refers to something that is so great that it cannot be calculated, measured or imitated. Special skills are often needed to fully perceive or understand the sublime. 
As a category in aestethics, the main property is that its beauty is bigger that something that is merely beautiful. Sometimes, the sublime may be sacred and causes awe.
It is only western philosophy that makes a distinction between the beautiful and the sublime; there is no such distinction in eastern philosophy.The first known work in philiosphy treating the sublime is called "On the Sublime", and was written by an otherwise unknown writer who lived in the first or third century. This writer is often called Longinus. Longinus was a teacher of rhetoric, and used the sublime to describe great language in this context. According to Longinus, the sublime inspires awe and veneration, with greater persuasive powers. Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux translated this work into French, in the 16th century; in the 18th century the text was translated into English as well.
Philosophers who wrote about the sublime include Edmund Burke, Immanuel Kant, Arthur Schopenhauer, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Theodor W. Adorno, and Jean-François Lyotard. Writers include Friedrich Schiller and Victor Hugo.

Renata Scotto

Renata Scotto (born on February 24, 1934) is an Italian operatic soprano who enjoyed a long and distinguished international career.
Born in Savona, Italy, she studied at the Milan Conservatory of Music, under Ghirardini and Merlini, and later in Rome with Mercedes Llopart. She made her stage debut in her hometown on Christmas Eve 1952, as Violetta in "La traviata". After winning first place in a singing competition, she was invited to sing Violetta at the Teatro Nuovo in Milan on July 2, 1953, which led to her debut at La Scala, the following December, as Walter in Catalani's "La Wally", opposite Renata Tebaldi and Mario Del Monaco. She quickly appeared in several other cities throughout Italy.
She sang in Cairo in 1956 and at The Stoll Theatre in London in 1957. That same year, she replaced Maria Callas in "La sonnambula" at the Edimburg Festival to considerable acclaim. This was the start of long and distinguished international career, with appearances in Chicago, San Francisco, Buenos Aires, Barcelona, Moscow, Tokyo, etc. She made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, on October 13, 1965, as Cio-Cio-San in "Madama Butterfly" and sang there regularly until 1987.
Scotto was mostly known for the Italian repertoire of which she sang a wide range of roles from bel canto to verismo. Although essentially a lyric soprano, as the years went on she tackled more dramatic roles in operas such as "Norma", "Macbeth", "La Gioconda", "Tosca", etc. 
After retiring from the stage, she turned to teaching, coaching and stage directing. She is married to violonist Lorenzo Anselmi since 1960 and has two children.

Europa (mythology)

Europa is a figure from Greek mythology. She is the daughter of Phoenician king Agenor and of Telephassa. Zeus falls in love with her. Because of his wife Hera, he has to take the shape of a bull. Hermes makes the herd of cattle with the bull Zeus graze near the beach near Sidon, where Europa is playing. That way, Zeus is able to abduct Europa on his back. He swims to Matala on Crete where he shows himself. The children of Europa and Zeus are Minos, Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon. Because of a prophecy of Aphrodite, the new continent Europe is named after Europa.
The oldest telling of the story can be found in the Illiad by Homer. There, she is the daughter of Phoinix. Other ancient tellings include "Europa" by Moschos, and the Metamorphoses by Ovid.
Agenor sent his sons to search for Europa, but they could not find her. Cadmus asks the Oracle at Delphi and is told to give up the search, and found Thebes in Boetia instead.
According to other sources, Europa remained on Crete, were she married Asterion, and became queen. Asterion did not have any children, so he adopted her sons.
The oldest known paintings which clearly show Europa date from the 7th century BC.

Marot jar

A marot jar is a special kind of syphon or siphon device invented some time during the 1700s. The device is filled up water and lets it out in a special way so that the speed and amount of water that comes out is always the same, even if the jar is completely full or almost empty.
In the diagram (see right), an air-tight jar contains some water (blue) and some air (yellow). The green pipe is started as a siphon so that water starts flowing out of the pipe. Because the pipe lets out water, the pressure on the inside of the jar is less than the pressure outside, so it causes air to be sucked in through the orange pipe. Because the pressure is going to tend to being the same inside and outside of the jar, the water is going to flow out of the pipe at the same speed and amount.

They thought it was gloomy. They thought it was not a good book for children. Some people thought it was unfair to the logging industry.
A young boy living in a polluted world visits a strange creature called the "Once-Ler". The boy asks about the poor state of the world. The Once-ler explains that the world was once beautiful. He made an invention that required him to chop down Trufulla trees. He says that everyone needed his invention. He made a profit from cutting down Trufulla trees. A small orange creature called the Lorax urged him to stop cutting down so many trees. He said that this was harming the environment. The Once-Ler ignored him. Eventually the supply of trees ran out. The land was left polluted. The animals left the forest. The Once-Ler finishes his story. He gives the boy "the last [Truffula seed] of all." He tells him to plant the seed It will grow into a forest.

The Cat in the Hat is a children's book written by Dr. Seuss and was first published in 1957. Seuss wrote the book after being challenged to write a story beginning readers would love. He was given a list of 438 words beginning readers were expected to know. He was told these were the only words he could use. He used 223 words on the list. The Cat would appear in other Dr. Seuss books. More than 11 million copies of the book have been printed. It has been translated into more than 12 different languages including Latin and Yiddish.

Les contes d'Hoffmann ("The Tales of Hoffmann") is a French opera. It has a prologue, three acts and an epilogue. The music was written by Jacques Offenbach. The libretto was written by Jules Berbier and Michel Carré. It is based on E.T.A Hoffmann's "Dr Sandmann, Geschichte von Verloreren Spiegelbilde". The opera was first performed in Paris, on 10 February 1881. 
The opera was the last and perhaps greatest work of Offenbach. It was not quite finished when he died. The final score was completed by Ernest Guiraud. Guiraud also wrote the recitatives, though at first it was meant to have spoken-dialogue. The work was an immediate success and has remained so since its creation.

The Song of Hiawatha

The Song of Hiawatha is an epic poem written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. It was first published in 1855. The poem was loosely based on the legends of Native American peoples. In 1857, Longfellow estimated that the work had sold 50,000 copies. 
"The Song" is about Hiawatha and his beloved Minnehaha. It is set along the south shore of Lake Superior. The poem was very popular, but critics did not like it. 
Composers and painters were inspired to create works based on the poem. A 2005 television movie was based on the poem.
Hiawatha's birth is foretold by a "mighty" peace-bringing leader named Gitche Manito. A woman named Nokomis falls from the moon. Nokomis gives birth to Wenonah. She grows to be a beautiful young woman. Nokomis warns her not to be seduced by the West Wind. She does not listen to her mother, and Hiawatha is born. 
Hiawatha has childhood adventures, falls in love with Minnehaha, slays the evil magician Pearl-Feather, invents written language, discovers corn, and other episodes. The poem closes with the approach of a canoe to Hiawatha's village. It contains "the Priest of Prayer, the Pale-face." Hiawatha welcomes him with joy. 
The "Black-Robe chief" brings word of Jesus Christ. Hiawatha and the chiefs accept the Christian message. Hiawatha says good-bye to Nokomis, the warriors, and the young men. He says, "But my guests I leave behind me / Listen to their words of wisdom, / Listen to the truth they tell you." He endorses the Christian missionaries. He launches his canoe for the last time westward toward the sunset. Then he departs forever.

Ed Sullivan

Edward Vincent "Ed" Sullivan (September 28, 1901 – October 13, 1974) was an American entertainment writer and television host. He was best known as the presenter of the television variety show "The Ed Sullivan Show". The program was shown on television from 1948 to 1971 (twenty-three years). It was one of the longest-running variety shows in United States history.
In 1996, Ed Sullivan was #50 on "TV Guide"'s "50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time".
Sullivan was born in New York City, New York. His mother was Elizabeth F. Sullivan (née Smith) and his father was Peter Arthur Sullivan. He was of Irish descent. Sullivan used to be a boxer. He began his media work as a sportswriter for "The New York Evening Graphic". 
Sullivan was engaged to swimmer Sybil Bauer, but she died of cancer in 1927 at the age of 23. He was married to Sylvia Weinstein from April 28, 1930. She died on March 16, 1973. They had a daughter, Betty Sullivan. Betty married the "Ed Sullivan Show"'s producer, Bob Precht.
Sullivan used to call Sylvia after every program to hear what she thought about it.
Sullivan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6101 Hollywood Boulevard. 
In September 1974, Sullivan had x-rays done. They showed that Sullivan had esophageal cancer. Only his family was told about it. Because the doctors did not give Sullivan a lot of time, the family chose not to tell him about it. Sullivan thought that his illness was because of ulcers. He died five weeks later, on October 13, 1974, at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital. 3,000 people went to his funeral. It was held at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York.

Psychological nativism

In psychology, nativism is a theory that says that most basic skills are hard-wired in the brain at birth. This theory is the opposite of the theory called the blank slate, or "tabula rasa". Blank slate theories said that humans have almost no skills or abilities at birth: they learn these skills over the course of their life. People who believe in nativism (within certain limits) include Jerry Fodor, Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker. These psychologists believe that humans are born with a set of abilities that help them learn other skills, such as speech. 
Some mammals do seem to inherit emotional reactions. Monkeys fearing snakes is an example. Most of the behaviour of insects, reptiles and birds is inherited in some detail. Mammals, however, show a greater ability for learning than other kinds of animals.
Charles Darwin, in "The expression of emotions in man and animals" (1872), showed that the way most emotions were shown was common between human cultures. He said this was inherited and had been the result of evolution. Behaviorism says that man's behaviour is affected by its results (operant conditioning). Behaviourists denied the importance of inherited behaviours, instincts, or an inherited tendency to behave. People who believe in evolutionary psychology think this is wrong. They think human behaviour has deep roots in our evolutionary past.

Syphon

The word syphon (, also spelled siphon) can refer to any device that conducts the flow of liquids through tubes. Used in the right way, the word refers to a tube in an upside-down U shape. The tube makes liquid flow up hill. It flows higher than the source of the liquid, to come out at a level lower than the surface of the source. The movement is done without pumps. It is powered by the fall of the liquid as it flows down the tube under the pull of gravity.
The syphon must touch the liquid in the (upper) reservoir (the source, where the liquid comes from) in order for it to work. This allows atmospheric pressure to push the liquid up the tube. The top of the tube is where the lowest pressure is, so the liquid will move towards that area in the same way as a barometer. The top of a syphon is the same as the height of a barometer, because they work in the same way. The lower pressure is caused by the liquid falling on the downhill side. A syphon can raise water to a height of 25 feet above the source elevation. New discoveries in Syphon Pump Metering allows for dispensing liquid above the source.

A siphon can be used for irrigation purposes. 
When both ends of a syphon are at atmospheric pressure (equal pressure), liquid flows from high to low. However, if the lower end is pressurised, liquid can flow from low to high. Most syphons have water as a fluid. Other fluids, such as mercury, or organic liquids or even gasses like carbon dioxide can also be syphoned.

DSM IV

The DSM-IV is the fourth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The DSM is a manual written by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). They are numbered using Roman numerals: DSM-I, DSM-II, DSM-III, DSM-IV, and DSM-V. After the DSM-IV was published, some changes (or revisions) were made to the descriptions in the manual. Because of this, the most recent version of the DSM-IV is officially called the DSM-IV-TR (the TR stands for "Text Revision").
The DSM lists every condition that is officially called a mental illness by the APA. The DSM organizes these conditions into different categories. Each condition is given a code, made up of numbers or a combination of numbers and letters. Along with the condition's name and code, the DSM also gives other information, like:
The conditions that are listed in the DSM have changed over time. In each new version of the DSM, the APA adds conditions that it has accepted as mental illnesses since the last version was published. It may also take out conditions that are no longer thought of as mental illnesses. (For example, homosexuality was listed as a mental illness in the earlier DSMs, but was then taken out.) The APA may also change the way it describes certain conditions.
When a person gets a DSM diagnosis, there are five different "axes", or categories of information that need to be included.
Axis I: This is where most mental health conditions are listed. Both the name of the condition and its assigned code need to be listed. For example, types of ADHD, depression, anxiety, and autism spectrum disorders would be listed here. A person can have just one Axis I diagnosis, or more than one.
Axis II: If the person has mental retardation or a personality disorder, it is listed here.
Axis III: If the person has medical conditions, they are listed here.
Axis IV: This axis records whether the person has certain kinds of "psychosocial stressors." There are few set categories of psychosocial stressors: Primary support problems (for example, family conflict); social environment problems (for example, the person has poor social skills and few friends); economic problems (like poverty or job loss); housing problems (like poor housing or homelessness); educational problems (like school failure); problems with access to healthcare services; and "other" stressors.
Axis V: For this axis, a mental health professional will pick a number that sums up how much the person is affected by his mental health problems, and how well he is functioning in his life. The professional uses a scale called the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), which explains what different numbers mean. A person's score is called his "GAF score."
There are a few benefits to the DSM's multi-axial system. The five axes sum up all of the information that is most important to mental health professionals when they are treating a person. They give a snapshot of the most important things that affect a person's mental health. A full DSM diagnosis is also like a common language to mental health professionals. Even if there are different professionals, who come from different specialties or even speak different languages, they will all understand the DSM diagnosis.
The conditions in the DSM are organized into categories. These categories are:
(1) "Disorders Usually Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, and Adolescence". For example: types of ADHD; mental retardation; autism spectrum disorders; and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD).
(2) "Delirium, Dementia, Amnestic, and Other Cognitive Disorders." These disorders cause problems with thinking and memory.
(3) "Mental Disorders Due to a General Medical Condition Not Otherwise Classified." These are disorders which are caused by a medical problem.
(4) "Substance-Related Disorders." These are conditions which have to do with use, abuse, or addiction to illegal drugs, alcohol, or other substances (like caffeine and nicotine). This category also includes conditions caused by withdrawal from these substances.
(5) "Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders." These include all of the different types of schizophrenia, and other disorders that cause psychosis (being out of touch with reality).
(6) "Mood Disorders". These include the different kinds of bipolar disorder and depression.
(7) "Anxiety Disorders." For example: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD); Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); Generalized Anxiety Disorder.
(8) "Somatiform Disorders." People with these disorders have a lot of physical symptoms, like pain or stomach problems. However, these symptoms are not thought to be caused by an actual medical disorder. They are thought to be caused by mental health problems instead. One example is hypochondriasis, where a person is always worried that they have serious medical problems when they do not. Another condition in this category is Body Dysmorphic Disorder, where a person hates his body, or a part of his body.
(9) "Factitious Disorders." People with these disorders exaggerate or make up medical problems. They may do this because it gets them things they want (for example, attention and sympathy).
(10) "Dissociative Disorders." These disorders cause a person to have problems with memory, awareness, and perceiving (seeing and understanding) things correctly. The person may also feel disconnected from his identity (his view of himself and who he is). The best-known condition in this category is Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) (which used to be called "Multiple Personality Disorder).
(11) "Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders." Sexual disorders include paraphilias, where a person is sexually attracted to objects or to kinds of sexual activity that are not normal. For example, pedophilia (being sexually attracted to children) is a type of paraphilia. Another type of sexual disorder is sexual dysfunction (problems with performing sexually). This category also includes Gender Identity Disorder, where a person feels like one gender, but has the body of another gender.
(12) "Eating Disorders." The two major types of eating disorders are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.
(13) "Sleep Disorders." For example: insomnia.
(14) "Impulse Control Disorders Not Otherwise Specified." These are disorders where people have trouble controlling their urges to do things. For example: trichotillomania (where a person pulls hair out of his body) and Intermittent Explosive Disorder (where a person has sudden explosions of anger).
(15) "Adjustment Disorders." With these disorders, a person is having trouble adjusting to, or getting used to, something stressful in his life.
(16) "Personality Disorders". These diagnoses can only be given to adults. For example: Antisocial Personality Disorder; Borderline Personality Disorder.

Preamble

A preamble is an introduction to a document that describes the documents purpose. The word comes from "pre" meaning "before" and "amble" meaning walk. A preamble can contain facts about the document. The preamble of a law is not part of the law but explains its purpose. The preamble of a book is called a "preface". The preamble of a musical composition is a prelude or overture. The preamble of a Wikipedia article walks before the sections, and is called the "lede" or "introduction". 
A data packet has a preamble which the system needs but which goes before the data that the user will use. 
One of the world's most famous preambles is the one in the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776:
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.

Thornhill (Alabama)

Thornhill is an old plantation house near Forkland, Alabama. The Greek Revival main house was built in 1833 by James Innes Thornton. Thornhill was a cotton plantation in the early 1830s. It extended over 2,600 acres. By 1860, there were 156 slaves working on the plantation. About a third of the slaves lived in quarters behind the main house. William Nichols is believed to be the architect. The house measures 55 feet wide. Inside is a 14 ft wide by 40 ft long central hall. There is a spiral staircase at the back. There are two rooms to either side. The left front room was the parlor. The dining room was behind it. On the front right was the master bedroom. The plantation office was behind it. Upstairs is a matching hall and four bedrooms. All eight rooms are 19.5 feet square. The downstairs rooms have 12-foot ceilings. The upstairs ceilings are 11 feet. There was once a brick kitchen behind the house. It later burned. Additions were made to the original house from 1890 to 1949. They were razed in 1994 and rebuilt to better match the original intent. The two-story portico with six Ionic columns was added about 1850. The plantation schoolhouse was constructed about 1845. The Thornton children and neighboring plantation children were taught there. Surrounding the schoolhouse are 230-year-old post oaks. The house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 10, 1984.

Haskell (programming language)

Haskell is a purely functional programming language. It is named after Haskell Brooks Curry, a U.S. mathematician who contributed a lot to logic. Haskell is based on lambda calculus and uses the Greek letter lambda as its logo. The main implementations are the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), and Hugs, a Haskell interpreter. 
The following is an example Hello World program in Haskell:
module Main where
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
One way to create an infinite list of Fibonacci numbers is this:
fib n = fibs !! n
Haskel was influenced by many earlier programming languages. These were Clean, FP, Gofer, Hope and Hope, Id, ISWIM, KRC, Lisp, Miranda, ML and Standard ML, Orwell, SASL, SISAL, and Scheme.
Haskell itself has influenced many later programming languages, such as Agda, Bluespec, C++11/Concepts, C#/LINQ, Cayenne, Clean, Clojure, CoffeeScript, Curry, F#, Isabelle, Java/Generics, Mercury, Perl 6, Python, Scala, Visual Basic 9.0.

Second Boer War

The Second Boer War (, or "Tweede Boereoorlog") was a war. It lasted from 11 October 1899 until 31 May 1902. In the war, the British Empire fought against the Afrikaans-speaking Dutch settlers of two independent Boer republics, the South African Republic (Transvaal Republic) and the Orange Free State. Winston Churchill, who later became famous, was captured but escaped. At this time, the British made use of concentration camps. This weakened the Boers. It helped the British stop the war from lasting any longer.
The British troops won the war. As a result, both republics were annexed to the British Empire. Later, both were eventually incorporated into the Union of South Africa, a dominion of the British Empire, in 1910. The conflict is commonly referred to as The Boer War but it is also known as the South African War outside South Africa, the Anglo-Boer War among most South Africans, and in Afrikaans as the "Anglo-Boereoorlog" or "Tweede Vryheidsoorlog" ("Second War of Liberation" or lit. "Second Freedom War") or the Engelse oorlog (English War).
The Second Boer War is a part of what are known as the Boer Wars. These include the lesser known First Boer War that took place from December 1880 to March 1881.

James Fenimore Cooper

James Fenimore Cooper (September 15, 1789 - September 14, 1851) was an American writer. He created the character of Natty Bumpo, the archetypal American frontiersman.
Cooper was born on September 15, 1789 in Burlington, New Jersey. His father was a United States Congressman. James Fenimore was one year old when his family moved to Cooperstown, New York. The community was started by his father. 
Cooper was 13 when he began attending Yale University. He was kicked out for playing pranks. He blew up another student's door. He also taught a donkey to sit in a professor's chair.
Cooper got a job as a seaman on a merchant ship. He joined the United States Navy at age 18. He became a midshipman, but left the Navy in 1811. 
Cooper married Susan DeLancey when he was 21. They had seven children. Five lived to be adults. The first-born survivor, Susan Fenimore Cooper, became a writer and naturalist.
"Precaution" was Cooper's first book. It was published anonymously in 1820. In 1823, he published "The Pioneers". This book was the first of the Leatherstocking novels. These stories became famous for the fictional character of an American woodsman called Natty Bumppo. Cooper's most famous novel "Last of the Mohicans" was published in 1826. It became one of the most widely read American novels of the 19th century.
In 1826, Cooper moved his family to Europe. He wanted to make more money as an author. He also wanted to give his children a better education. He continued to write. His books published in Paris include "The Red Rover" and "The Water Witch". These were novels about the sea. His books began taking a political angle. These books are forgotten today. He returned to the United States in 1833. 
Cooper moved back to his ancestral home Otsego Hall in Cooperstown. His writing continued in a political vein. His readers did not like this. He returned to fiction books with "The Pathfinder" and "The Deerslayer". These books continued the story of Natty Bumppo. Cooper spent his last years in Cooperstown. He died on September 14, 1851.

Otsego Hall

Otsego Hall was a house in Cooperstown, New York. It was the ancestral home of American author James Fenimore Cooper. It was built by his father William Cooper, who also founded the village of Cooperstown. This village was where the Hall was located. Building began in 1796. The Hall was completed in 1799. It was the largest private home in central New York for a long time.
In June 1834 James Fenimore Cooper decided to reopen the Hall. He had lived in other places for almost sixteen years. The Hall had been closed for a long time. It was falling into decay. Repairs were begun at once, and the Hall was quickly restored. At first, James spent his winters in New York City and his summers in Cooperstown. Eventually he made Otsego Hall his forever home. The Hall burned down a few years after he died. The surrounding property was sold. His daughter and secretary, Susan Fenimore Cooper, built her home in Cooperstown with bricks and other materials from the ruins of Otsego Hall.

Adsorption

Adsorption is the sticking of atoms or molecules to a surface (called "adsorbent"). The particles which get stuck on can be from a gas, liquid or a dissolved solid. An example would be the way water sticks to the surface of sand grains on a beach, or to particles of soil.
The exact nature of the force which holds them on varies according to the nature of the surface and the adsorbed molecules. The force may be a weak physical force, or weak chemical bonds, but strong enough to keep the layer of molecules stuck on. Supplying more heat usually breaks the bonds and causes the adsorbed molecules to evaporate. Only "free water" (that is not trapped inside solid particles) can evaporate.

Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania

The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania is the main legal body used around the world by Jehovah's Witnesses to organize the religion and also to decide on its official list of beliefs. Members of Jehovah's Witnesses usually call it just as "the Society". Its headquarters are in Brooklyn, New York in the United States and its rules allow only between 300 and 500 members. All of them must be "mature, active and faithful" male Jehovah's Witnesses.
A preacher, Charles Taze Russell, started the organization in 1881 as "Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society", so he could share religious pamphlets with people. In 1896, its name was changed to "Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society". When Russell died in 1916, a fight started between some of the society's directors and the man who took his place, Joseph Franklin Rutherford. The fight became very bitter and many of the people who had followed Russell, who were called International Bible Students, left and started other religious groups. But Rutherford stayed as president of the society and in 1931 the Bible Student groups around the world changed their name to Jehovah's witnesses. In 1955, the corporation changed its name again to "Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania". From 1976, the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses began to control all the decisions and the work of the Watch Tower Society.
Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society was started in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on February 16, 1881 to organize the printing and sharing of pamphlets written about God and the Bible. William Henry Conley, a Pittsburgh businessman, was its first president and Russell was its secretary-treasurer. Its main publication was "Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence", a Bible-based magazine first published in 1879 by Russell. On December 15, 1884, the society became officially registered and Russell was listed as its president. Russell wrote its charter, or statement of its purpose, and explained that it was for "the mental, moral and religious improvement of men and women, by teaching the Bible by means of the publication and distribution of Bibles, books, papers, pamphlets and other Bible literature, and by providing oral lectures free for the people". 
Anyone who gave $10 or more to the society was told they were a member of the society and could vote at its meetings, but Russell explained that all the decisions about what the society did would still be made by only two people—him and his wife Maria, who owned most of the shares. In his magazine, Russell explained that the Watch Tower Society was not a "religious society", but just a business organization with no set of official beliefs.
In 1900 the society opened its first overseas branch office in Britain. Another one opened in Germany in 1903 and then in Australia in 1904. In 1909 the society bought some property in Brooklyn and then moved its headquarters and staff there.
After Russell died in 1916, the Watch Tower Society's lawyer, Joseph Franklin Rutherford, was elected as its next president. But within a few months most of the seven board of directors complained that he was behaving like a dictator and not sharing information. A major fight broke out, and Rutherford told the four directors who criticised him that they were no longer on the board. In June 1917, the society published a book called "The Finished Mystery" and said it was the last of a series of Bible study books by Russell. The book made some very strong statements about the leaders of Catholic and Protestant churches and said they were wrong for taking part in the Great War. As a result, the Watch Tower Society's president and directors were jailed as traitors under the "1917 Espionage Act", although they were later allowed to leave jail and the government dropped the charges.
Until that time each congregation of Bible Students in the world made its own decisions, although they all studied Russell's books and followed his teachings. But Rutherford decided they should all have exactly the same set of beliefs and run their congregations the same way. He told them they had to obey what the Watch Tower Society's New York headquarters told them. A director was put into each congregation, and a year later all members were told to write out a report each week of what public preaching they had done. At an international meeting held at Cedar Point, Ohio, in September 1922, Rutherford began teaching that the Bible Students' most important job was to teach people about the Bible by visiting them at their homes. Watch Tower Society books began using the name "Jehovah" much more often when writing about God, and in 1931 Rutherford decided the religion would be called Jehovah's witnesses.
When Rutherford died in 1942, Nathan H. Knorr became the new president. Two years later he changed the words in the charter, or society's rules, to say that its main purposes were to preach about God's kingdom to people in all countries, and print and share Bibles and other books and magazines that would help them learn about that. The rules about who could be a member of the society were also changed, making it open only to a maximum of 500 men who would be chosen by the leaders of the society. Knorr died in 1977 and since then the presidents have been Frederick W. Franz, Milton G. Henschel and Don A. Adams.
The Watch Tower Society is a major publisher of religious books, magazines and Bibles. By 1979, it had 39 printing branches worldwide. In 1990 it was reported that in one year the society printed 696 million copies of its magazines, "The Watchtower" and "Awake!" as well as another 35,811,000 pieces of literature worldwide, which are offered door-to-door by Jehovah's Witnesses. In 2012, the Society said it prints more than 41 million copies of each magazine each month.
The society has about 20,000 workers at its New York headquarters and branch offices around the world, and says its staff are volunteers rather than employees. Workers receive a small monthly wage with meals and accommodation provided by the society. The "Bethel family" in the Brooklyn headquarters includes hairdressers, dentists, doctors, housekeepers and carpenters, as well as shops for repairing personal appliances, watches, shoes and clothing without charge for labor.
The society does not give any financial figures to the public, but it said in 2011 that it had spent more than $173 million that year to care for full-time preachers and traveling overseers. Most of its money comes from donations given by people when they take magazines, and most of that is used on its preaching work.

Shadows-on-the-Teche

Shadows-on-the-Teche is an old plantation house at 317 E. Main St., New Iberia, Louisiana. It was built in 1833-34. Original owners David and Mary Weeks were rich growers of sugarcane. They owned four plantations. The house is Greek Revival in style. A portico of eight columns supports a second floor verandah. The house is made of bricks. The interior was originally furnished with Federal-style and Empire-style furniture imported from the East Coast. The house was built on the edge of one of Weeks's sugarcane plantations. It was designed for social life and entertaining. The house was said to be the third brick house built on Bayou Teche.
A series of tragedies struck the Weeks family following the completion of the house. David Weeks died in August 1834. His wife married John Moore. The household was dependent on slavery. Mary and John supported secession. During the American Civil War, Federal troops occupied the property. Union officers lived in the house. Mary Weeks died in December 1863. The house was still being used by Union troops. He son restored some of the family fortune during the Reconstruction years. Succeeding generations however were forced to sell much of the property to meet living expenses.
David and Mary Weeks's great-grandson, William Weeks Hall, lived in the house from 1922 until his death in 1958. He tried to preserve what remained of the property. He made a large garden of live oak, bamboo, camellias, azaleas, and other plants. He donated the house and garden to the National Trust for Historic Preservation at his death. The Trust has owned and operated Shadows until the present. Shadows-on-the-Teche was named a National Historic Landmark on 30 May 1974.

Slave breeding in the United States

Slave breeding was a practice of American slave owners. Its purpose was to make more slaves. More slaves meant more money for slave owners. Slaves were forced to mate. Pregnancies were encouraged. Slave masters often mated with their own slaves to make more slave children. Slave owners favored female slaves who could have large numbers of children. Slaves cost a lot of money. Breeding slaves made new slaves without having to pay for them. Also, the end of the Atlantic slave trade created labor shortages. Slaves were bred to fill these shortages. Slave breeding tried to improve the health and productivity of slaves. The practice was approved in the South because slaves were considered to be less than human. They were property, like a horse or a dog. Slaves were not given or expected to have the same rights as free people.

Meadowlawn (Alabama)

Meadowlawn is an antebellum (before the American Civil War) plantation house built in the Greek revival style. It is located in Lowndesboro, Alabama. The house is a two-story frame house with 13 fluted Doric columns on two sides. There are balconies over both main entrance doors with wrought iron railings.
Meadowlawn was built in 1853 for Squire George Thomas (1797-1867). The house was later sold to Fort Williamson. In 1905 the house was sold to Ransom Meadows (1846-1940). He was the last surviving Confederate veteran in Lowndes County. His daughter, Aline Meadows, (1880-1979) married Robert Bragg Hagood on April 3, 1907. Ransom Meadows deeded the house to the Hagoods. Mrs. Hagood named the house Meadowlawn. She lived in the house until her death at age 99. The house still remains in the Hagood family. It is a contributing property of the Lowndesboro Historic District. The District was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 1973.

Magnolia Hall (Alabama)

Magnolia Hall is a plantation house at the corner of Otts and Tutwiler streets in Greensboro, Alabama. It is also known as the McCrary-Otts House. It is a historic Greek Revival mansion. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing property to the Greensboro Historic District. It was recorded by the Historic American Buildings Survey in March 1936.
Greensboro became prosperous as part of the cotton boom of the mid-19th century. In 1850 William Murphy, a lawyer and legislator, sold a prime lot to David F. McCrary, a prominent cotton broker and planter. McCrary had originally come from North Carolina. He married Elizabeth Cowan Lowry, daughter of a prominent Alabama family. McCrary had Murphy’s house removed. He hired the architect B. F. Parsons to design a new mansion. The house was completed in about 1855. The "Alabama Beacon" reported that the house cost $10,000. It was a very large sum at the time.
McCrary’s finances survived the American Civil War. He opened the Greensboro Bank and Exchange in 1871. His only living child and her husband inherited the property when MCCrary died in 1888. Their son and his wife bought the house from siblings in the 1920s. It stayed in the family until 1970. It was sold to Mr. and Mrs. M. D. Baines. The house was sold again in 2011.
A detailed, twelve-page building contract for Magnolia Hall still exists. It calls for porticos, north and south, each with six fluted columns, of the "Grecian Ionic Order ... the Entablature and Mouldings all to harmonize with it ... and proportioned after the order." There are double balconies of delicate iron grill work. There are colored glass transoms around the doors. Inside are large four over four rooms, 14 foot ceilings, chandelier medallions, and a grand mahogany-railed staircase in the hallway. W. E. Yerby in his "History of Greensboro" wrote that Magnolia Hall "is indisputably one of the finest antebellum mansions in Alabama ... [and] a perfect example of late Greek Revival architecture."

<doc id="330512" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=330512" title="Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park">
Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park

Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park is a national park of Australia. It is in the Northern Territory, south-west of Alice Springs. The surrounds the two huge rock formations it is named after: Uluṟu (Ayers Rock) and Kata Tjuṯa (The Olgas).
Archaeological work near Uluṟu has shown that people have been in the area for at least 22,000 years. They probably moved in and out of the area depending on how much food and water there was. People started to live in the area year-round about 10,000 years ago. The native Aṉangu people were hunter-gatherers. They lived in small nomadic groups. Groupings were based on water and food supply in their area ("ngura").
The Aṉangu believe that Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa were created by ancestral spirits ("tjukuritja" or "waparitja"). This is part of their creation story, known as "tjukurpa" (the "Dreamtime"). According to the legend, the world was once blank and featureless, until there came creator beings. They travelled across the land and created rocks, rivers, trees–all living things and the landscape as it is seen today.
The Aṉangu believe that these spirits still live within the land. Each set of rocks represents a different ancestral spirit. The Aṉangu communicate (listen and feel) with the spirits by touching the rock. They do this for blessings or guidance with something. It is said that many spirits, like "kaḻaya" (emu), "liru" (poisonous snake), "lungkaṯa" (lizard) and "luuṉpa" (kingfisher), travel around the park. Other spirits only stay in one area, like "kuniya", a python who lives in the rocks at Uluṟu. The great snake king called "wanambi" is said to live at the top of Kata Tjuṯa.
There are different stories about the origin of Uluṟu. One says that it came after a great battle between ancestral spirits. The story tells that after many spirits were killed, the earth rose up in sadness, becoming Uluṟu. Another legend tells that the two serpent spirits "kuniya" and "liru" fought many wars there, putting the cracks and scars in the rock. Kata Tjuṯa is said to give knowledge that is considered very powerful and dangerous. It is only allowed to be known by men who have gone through initiation. So stories about the creation of this rock are a secret. The common idea behind all these creation stories is that places like Uluṟu are physical evidence of the activities of ancestral beings.
Aṉangu believe they are directly descended from these ancestral beings. They believe that their ancestors live within the land. Many places around the park are sacred because of this. They are bonded to the land in a kind of kinship, because the main principle of "tjukurpa" is that people and the land are connected. "Tjukurpa" is an oral tradition (not written down). It makes up the Aṉangu belief system, moral code and legal code. It is passed on through story, song, dance and art.
Europeans came to the Western Desert of Australia in the 1870s. They came in expeditions while the Overland Telegraph Line was being made. The first European explorer to the area was Ernest Giles. In 1872, Giles spotted Kata Tjuṯa from Kings Canyon and called it "Mount Olga", in honour of Queen Olga of Württemberg. He was not able to reach it, though, because his path was blocked by Lake Amadeus. The next year, another explorer named William Gosse reached Uluṟu and named it "Ayers Rock" after Sir Henry Ayers. More people explored the area over the next few years, to look for land they could use for raising livestock. They eventually left because the land was too dry. The native Aṉangu people had not had much contact with these explorers, and very few white people visited the area after this.
In March 1920, the area was made an aboriginal reserve, called the Petermann Reserve. It was meant to be a temporary refuge (safe place) for the Aṉangu. The government said they could continue their nomadic lifestyle there until they could be assimilated into white society. During the 1930s, there became more and more encounters between the natives and white people. Trading with dingo hunters (called "doggers") brought the natives food, tools and clothes they had not seen before. Many became curious about white people and their world.
During this time, more and more land around the reserve was being used for livestock. Long droughts during this time caused conflicts between the Aṉangu and farmers over things like food and water. Encounters with stockmen on nearby cattle stations were often violent. In 1934, a man was shot dead at Uluṟu by police. Aṉangu people became frightened of police and many left the area for safety. Later, some groups started to work on the stations in exchange for food. Others moved to towns because they wanted the things white people had. As a result, many people in the government believed that the reserve had failed to protect the Aṉangu lifestyle.
In the late 1930s, prospectors thought there might be gold in the area. There was a famous story of a lost gold deposit called Lasseter's Reef. The man who said he had found it had died near the Petermann Ranges in 1931, and it was said to be located somewhere in the area. In 1940, the Petermann Reserve was made smaller, so that people could look for the gold. At the same time, an interest in tourism at Uluṟu began to grow. A track for vehicles to reach Uluṟu was built from Curtin Springs in 1948. Tour groups from Alice Springs began arriving a few years later. At first, the government only allowed a few tour companies to go to the rock, because it was still part of the reserve. But demand for tourist income was growing fast. In 1951, Connellan Airways asked for an airstrip to be built next to Uluṟu, even though planes were already landing there.
In 1958, the government cut the area around Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa from the Aṉangu reserve, creating the Ayers Rock–Mt Olga National Park. It claimed that the rocks were no longer important to the natives. The new park was managed by the Territory government, which leased the land out to tour companies. Connellan built their airstrip close to the northern side of Uluṟu in 1959. Campsites and motels were built in 1967.
The Aṉangu were told not to come into the park, but they did anyway. Uluṟu was an important stopping point on travels because of the water usually located there. At first they were tolerated by the park rangers. But as the number of tourists at Uluṟu rose, there were conflicts between tourists and Aṉangu. The government then tried to move them away from the area by building the Docker River village, to the west, in 1968. Because their homeland and lifestyle had changed, the Aṉangu had to find new ways to make a living. They began selling handicrafts and artworks to tourists. Those still living at Uluṟu even opened a store, called the Ininti Store, which they leased from the government in 1972.
In 1971, Aṉangu groups met with the Office of Aboriginal Affairs, a part of the government that were in charge of looking after aboriginal people. Aṉangu people told the Office that they were worried about the effects mining and tourism were having on their land. They also said that their sacred sites were being desecrated (not being looked after properly). They asked for the government's help in protecting them.
In 1973, people from the government visited to make a report on the park. This report said that Aṉangu should be involved in the park's management. It said they could be hired as rangers, and that their sacred sites should be protected. It also advised that all the tourist facilities be moved out of the park. This was because they were having a bad effect on the environment. In 1975, the area called Yulara, to the north, was set aside for this. The airstrip was removed and rebuilt in Yulara in 1982. The resort at Yulara opened in 1983. After that, the campground and motels inside the park were closed, and everything was removed from the park by the end of 1984.
In 1976, the Aboriginal Land Rights Act was passed for the Northern Territory. It allowed native people to claim rights to own land if they lived on it before Europeans arrived, but only if the land is not already owned. The Aṉangu asked for ownership of the park's land under this law in 1979. But because it had already been made a national park, the claim was not allowed. Even so, the court decided that the Aṉangu were the "traditional" owners ("nguraṟitja") of the land.
There was then a long legal case over the freehold title (actual ownership) of the lands. The case continued until November 1983, when Prime Minister Bob Hawke acknowledged that the Aṉangu had the rights to Uluṟu. On 26 October 1985, they were given the title deeds for the park as the traditional and legal owners of the land. The Territory government protested this decision. It had made a big and expensive campaign to get support and stop it happening. In exchange for ownership, the Aṉangu had to lease the land back to the federal government so that it could stay as a national park. They started managing the park together in April 1986.
Uluru National Park was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, as a natural property. It had already been made a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1977. This means it was an important natural environment. The name of the park changed to Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park in 1993. The next year, it was added to the list again, this time as a cultural landscape. This means that it is one of the few sites in the world that is chosen for both its natural and cultural importance. The listing recognised "tjukurpa" as being the best tool for looking after the park. In 1995, Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park won the highest UNESCO award for setting new standards for the management of a World Heritage site.
Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park is in the southwestern corner of the Northern Territory, in the centre of Australia. It is southwest of Alice Springs. The park covers of flat, red-sand plains. The huge rock formations of Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa are the only major landmarks.
Uluṟu is an sandstone inselberg, rising above the plains around it. Most of its bulk is below the ground. Kata Tjuṯa, west of Uluṟu, is a group of 36 rock domes (or bornhardts), divided by steep-sided valleys. It covers an area of . The tallest dome, Mount Olga, is above the surrounding plain. It is the highest point in the park, at above sea level.
The only permanent settlement in the park is the Aṉangu village of Muṯitjulu. It is on the eastern side of Uluṟu, and about 350 people live there.
Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa are made of different types of sedimentary rock. Uluṟu is mostly made of arkose, a hard type of sandstone that contains a lot of the mineral feldspar. The sediment originally comes mostly from granite. Kata Tjuṯa is made of conglomerate, which consists of bits of rock that has been cemented together by sand and mud. The sediment in this rock is a mixture of granite, gneiss and basic rocks.
Even though the rock types are different, Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa are thought to be about the same age. They have both been exposed because of folding, faulting and the erosion of surrounding rock.
The park is in a geological area called the Amadeus sedimentary basin. The basin was formed about 900 million years ago. Over hundreds of millions of years, it was covered by layer after layer of sediment, until about 300 million years ago. About 550 million years ago, the mountain ranges to the south and west were pushed up out of the ground in a mountain-building event. These mountains quickly crumbled and huge chunks of sediment were pushed northward by rivers. The rivers flattened out into at least two alluvial fans. It is the remains of these alluvial fans that are seen today as Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa.
By about 500 million years ago, a shallow inland sea formed in the basin. Over many hundreds of years, sand and mud fell to the bottom of the sea, covering the alluvial deposit. This layer cemented everything together, forming the arkose over Uluṟu and the conglomerate over Kata Tjuṯa. The sea dried up between 400 and 300 million years ago. A long period of folding tilted the horizontal rock layers. The layers of Uluṟu arkose were folded to the near vertical position they are in today. The conglomerate of Kata Tjuṯa was tilted about 15 to 20 degrees from the horizontal. This means that Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa are the exposed tips of huge rock slabs that run far below the ground.
A valley was formed between the two rocks about 65 million years ago. Newer layers of sediment were added to the old ones. These were covered by the red sand that can be seen today, which was brought in by wind.
The big canyons of Kata Tjuṯa are thought to be evidence of faults that formed while the rock was being folded millions of years ago. Many years of weathering has made the faults bigger and water has eroded the rock into the valleys and domes seen today. Uluṟu has deep parallel fractures that run down its sides. These are caused by erosion, mostly from rainwater running off the domed top. The caves around the base of Uluṟu were formed by water weathering, though the exact process is still not known. Erosion of the rock is very slow, because the surface is very hard, and because there is no major jointing or parting at its base.
The bright orange-red colour of the rock surfaces comes from the oxidation (or rusting) of the iron in the arkose. When fresh (not exposed to the air), the arkose has a grey colour. Uluṟu appears to change colour at different times of the day and year. It glows a deep red colour during sunrise and sunset. The red light that comes across the sky at these times reflects off the rock, sand and clouds to make a bright glowing effect.
Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa is normally arid (dry). Most of the water in the park is under the ground. It can stay under the park for thousands of years. In the end, it all drains through the ground to Lake Amadeus in the north. Knowing where to find this underground water has always been important for human survival in the area. It is the only supply of water in the area that people can rely on. Both Muṯitjulu and Yulara get their water from ancient aquifers under the park. The water contains salt, which is removed before it is used. The aquifers being refilled depends on rare major rains, normally happening every ten years or so.
There are no proper watercourses in the park. Creek beds and gullies are mostly found in the valleys around Kata Tjuṯa. These are usually dry, except after heavy rains, but water can stay under the sand for months. The soils in the park contain high levels of clay, which stops water from soaking into the ground too quickly. The only lasting surface water in the park is Muṯitjulu Waterhole (""), at the base of Uluṟu. It has many waterholes (pockets of water) that have formed by rain running off the rock down its fracture lines. They are the only lasting spots of water above the ground for hundreds of kilometres in any direction. They normally have some water in them for the whole year.
Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa has a mostly dry climate. Rainfall is usually low, very hard to predict. The park gets an average of of rain per year, but each year can be very different. Rain is most common between November and March. Droughts are common and can be very long. The most rain recorded in one year was in 1974. The least amount was in 1965. The year 1965 was also the end of the longest drought that has been recorded here, which lasted six and a half years. Major rainfalls (periods with lots of rain) are rare, happening about every ten years. They are very important for refilling the groundwater supply and can put a lot of life into the ecosystems. The last major rainfall was in 2009, which got of rain.
The average relative humidity is a lot lower than in coastal areas. It normally lowers as the temperature rises. The average rate of evaporation per year is high at about . The levels of UV on most summer days reach between 11 and 15.
As in most arid inland areas, the days are very hot and the nights are very cold. The months between October and March have an average of 43 days where the temperature is above 40°C. The highest temperature recorded in the park was 47°C in December 1993. In winter, the temperature overnight often falls below freezing (0°C). The average temperature range for winter months is 14–30°C. The lowest temperature recorded in the park was –5°C in July 1976.
The Aṉangu say the park has five seasons:
The park is ranked as one of the most important arid land ecosystems in the world. It is one of 15 biosphere reserves in Australia under UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere system. The landscape looks quite barren, but is actually a complex ecosystem with many forms of life. Plants and animals have adapted to the area's extreme conditions. As a result, it supports some of the most unusual flora and fauna on the planet.
Much of the park land is made up of flat plains dotted with many kinds of spinifex grasses. There are also large areas of sand dunes, rocky scrubland and open woodland. The gullies and creek lines that fan out from the rock formations form their own unique habitats, because of the concentration of water in the ground there.
The park is managed jointly (together) by the Aṉangu and Parks Australia. Parks Australia is the government body that looks after national parks in Australia. It is a part of the Department of the Environment. The Aṉangu own the land, and lease it to the government. The lease began in 1985 and lasts for 99 years. Decisions are made by the Board of Management, a group of people. Under the lease terms, the Aṉangu always hold a majority on the management board. There are 12 people on the board.
The Director of National Parks is the only permanent seat. All the others sit for five years, and then new people are chosen. All choices have to be approved by the Aṉangu. The staff that work in the park every day are from Parks Australia. This team is overseen by a general park manager, who reports to the Director.
"Tjukurpa", the Aṉangu legal code, makes up the basis for the park's management. It says how to deal with problems, and sets penalties for people who break the rules. The Aṉangu have used the Australian legal system to enforce "tjukurpa" and protect their sacred values. Sacred sites are registered under Territory law; it is against the law for visitors to enter them. Laws also protect traditional designs from being copied. Aṉangu have the right to forage and hunt in the park.

Cape Henry Light

The Cape Henry Lighthouse is a lighthouse in Virginia. It is near Virginia Beach, Virginia. For a long time, it has been important for the large amount of shipping entering the Chesapeake Bay from the Atlantic Ocean. The first building was the first lighthouse authorized by the U.S. government. It was built in 1792. The lighthouse was also the first federal construction project under the Constitution. It was expected to cost $15,200 to build. Another $2,500 was needed to finish the lighthouse. A second lighthouse was built in 1881 a short distance away. It was built because people were worried the first building was not stable.
The Cape Henry Lighthouse was the first work of the new U.S. Federal government. It was built of stone by John McComb, Jr.. The building was finished in October, 1792. McComb was one of the architects that helped build New York City Hall. He also designed other lighthouses. The lighthouse's design was based on the 1767 Cape Henlopen Light. The lighthouse was damaged by Confederate forces during the American Civil War. It was repaired by Union forces in 1863. Union forces needed the light for navigation. In the 1870s, people worried about the condition and safety of the old lighthouse at Cape Henry. Because of this, the New Cape Henry Lighthouse was built in 1881. The new lighthouse is southeast of the old lighthouse. The old tower was not destroyed. It is still standing. The old lighthouse is still a daymark used for triangulation. The lighthouse was fully automated in 1983.
In 1798, Benjamin Latrobe visited Cape Henry Lighthouse and described it as "an octangular truncated pyramid of eight sides, rising 90 feet to the light..." The Old Cape Henry Lighthouse is 26 feet in diameter at its base and 16 feet at its top. It was built with Aquia Creek sandstone. The sandstone came from the same source as the White House. 
The new lighthouse is tall. It was built of cast iron and wrought iron. It also has a more powerful light.
Preservation Virginia took control of the older lighthouse in 1930. Preservation Virginia was known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities at the time. A brick lining and an iron stairway have been added to the lighthouse. The lighthouse is open to the public. It was made a National Historic Landmark on January 29, 1964. In 2002 the American Society of Civil Engineers listed the lighthouse a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.
The lighthouses are located in the city of Virginia Beach. They are inside of the boundaries of Fort Story. It is an Army base. The Cape Henry Memorial is next to the lighthouses.

Washington Irving

Washington Irving was an American writer. He was born in New York City on April 3, 1783. He began his literary career writing humorous newspaper sketches. He edited magazines. He went to Europe on family matters as a young man. He remained there for 17 years. He served as the United States ambassador to Spain from 1842 to 1846. He wrote biographies. He regarded his 5-volume life of George Washington as his masterpiece. He died in his home, Sunnyside, at Tarrytown, New York on November 28, 1859. 
Irving and his contemporary James Fenimore Cooper were America's first internationally acclaimed authors. Irving encouraged American authors and supported stronger copyright laws. He is best known today for two short stories: "Rip Van Winkle" and "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow". They have been adapted to the stage, to television, and to animated and live-action movies.

Sunnyside (Tarrytown, New York)

Sunnyside is a house in Tarrytown, New York. It was once the home of American writer Washington Irving. He wrote many books, but he is best known for the short stories "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" and "Rip Van Winkle". Irving bought the property on June 7, 1835 for $1,800. He described it to his brother as "a beautiful spot, capable of being made a little paradise ... I have had an architect up there, and shall build upon the old mansion this summer. My idea is to make a little nookery somewhat in the Dutch style, quaint, but unpretending. It will be of stone." In its day, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. said that Sunnyside stood "next to Mount Vernon, the best known and most cherished of all the dwellings in our land." The public interest in the home drew several gawkers hoping to catch a glimpse of Irving working. Irving died of a heart attack in his bedroom at Sunnyside on November 28, 1859. Irving's descendants lived in the house until 1945. In that year, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. bought it. He opened the house to tourists in 1947. Sunnyside is now a museum. An admission fee is charged. The house contains furniture that once belonged to Irving. Sunnyside became a National Historic Landmark in 1962.

"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" is a short story by Washington Irving. The story was published in 1820 in a collection of Irving's literary pieces called "The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent." The story was one of the first fictional works by an American author to become popular outside the United States. Adaptations include Walt Disney's animated movie "The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad" of 1949 and, more recently, Tim Burton's "Sleepy Hollow" of 1999 starring Johnny Depp. 
A lanky school teacher named Ichabod Crane arrives in the village of Tarry Town. He is very superstitious. He falls in love with pretty Katrina Van Tassel (and her father's large farm). 
Katrina has a suitor though. His name is Brom Bones. Brom is a rowdy and boisterous young man. He does not like Ichabod. He does not like Ichabod hovering about Katrina. 
One autumn night after a party at the Van Tassel's, Ichabod sets off for home alone. He thinks he sees the Headless Horseman, a dead soldier of the Revolution whose head was blown off by a cannon ball. His ghost haunts the countryside in search of his head. 
He chases Ichabod. Ichabod is terrified and runs away. He is never seen again. Villagers find only a smashed Jack-o'-lantern. Whenever the story is told, Brom gives a knowing wink. It is implied that he frightened away his rival by posing as the Headless Horseman.

Études (Chopin)

The Études by Polish composer Frédéric Chopin are three sets of études for piano. 
Chopin's "Études" are some of the hardest pieces of all the works in concert piano repertoire. Because of this, the music remain famous and are often played at concerts. Some are so famous they have been given nicknames, but none were given by Chopin.
All twenty-seven "Études" were published during Chopin's lifetime; Opus 10, the first group of twelve were written between 1829 and 1832, and were published in 1833, in France, Germany, and England. The twelve "Études" of Opus 25 were composed at various times between 1832 and 1836, and were published in the same countries in 1837. The final three, part of a series called "Méthode des méthodes de piano" compiled by Moscheles and Fétis, were composed in 1839 but with no opus number.
The first "Études" of the Opus 10 set were written when Chopin was still in his teens. Chopin's "Études" elevated the musical form from purely utilitarian exercises to great artistic masterpieces. At a concert in which Chopin performed his opus 25, Robert Schumann said "À la Chopin".

Lev Ivanov

Lev Ivanovich Ivanov (1834-1901) was a Russian ballet dancer and choreographer. He became Second Balletmaster of the Imperial Ballet. Ivanov is credited with choreographing "The Nutcracker" in 1892 due to the ill health of Ballet Master Marius Petipa. The extent of his work is disputed. Only Pepita's name appeared on posters for the first production. Ivanov also worked with Petipa on a restaging of "Swan Lake"in 1895. He choreographed Acts 2 and 4, and the Italian and Hungarian dances in Act 3. Other ballets choreographed by Ivanov as the Second Balletmaster to Petipa include "The Enchanted Forest" (1887), and "The Tulip of Haarlem" (1887). Ivanov is credited with the choreography for the "Polovetsian Dances" in the first production of Borodin's "Prince Igor" in 1890. Late in life, Ivanov petitioned the Imperial Theatres for financial assistance on the strength of his 50 years of service. He died in poverty.

Italian Concerto

The "Italian" Concerto (or, Concerto in the Italian style) is a piece of music for harpsichord composed by Johann Sebastian Bach. It was published in 1735 with the "French Overture" in the second volume of Bach's "Keyboard Practice". Both pieces are Bach's interpretations of popular musical forms of the day. The "Italian Concerto" is a three-movement composition written specifically for a two-manual harpsichord (see image). 
The first movement is written in F major. It has a time signature of 2/4, but lacks a tempo marking. It is always played Allegro (fast). The second movement is written in D minor. Its time signature is 3/4, and its tempo marking is Andante (slow). The third movement is written in F major. Its time signature is cut-time (2/2), and its tempo is marked Presto (very fast). The first and third movements are composed in "ritornello" style. This means a theme particular to the movement returns time and again. The second movement is a very florid arioso-like piece. 
An orchestral Italian concerto relies upon contrasts between the full orchestra and a small group of instruments which act as soloists. Bach achieves this effect by using the lower manual on the harpsichord as the "full orchestra" and the upper manual as the "small group of instruments".

Falstaff

Sir John Falstaff is a fictional character who appears in three plays by William Shakespeare. In two of the "Henry IV" plays, he is a friend of Prince Hal, the man who becomes King Henry V. 
Falstaff is very fat. He thinks he is very important and is always boasting. He is also a coward. Falstaff makes Prince Hal get into trouble. When Hal becomes king Falstaff is rejected.
Falstaff is a comic figure, but Shakespeare makes him say some things which tell us a lot about human nature. For example: before a battle in "Henry V" he explains that his cowardice is actually common sense, because honour in battle is not really worth anything. Honour would not stop other people saying he was a coward and it would not help him if he got injured.
Falstaff also appears in "The Merry Wives of Windsor".
Shakespeare’s character inspired several musicians to compose music about him. Carl Otto Nicolai wrote an opera called "Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor" (1849). Verdi’s wrote an opera Falstaff based on the same play. It is often thought to be Verdi’s greatest opera. Ralph Vaughan Williams wrote an opera called "Sir John in Love", (1924–1928). Elgar wrote a brilliant piece for orchestra called “Falstaff” which he called: “a symphonic study”.
It is likely that Shakespeare based the character of Falstaff on a real person. Many ideas have been discussed but no one can be sure who Shakespeare may have had in mind.

He has played with the best orchestras in Europe, the United States and his native China. He is very famous around the world for his concert performances, television appearances, albums and soundtracks. Lang has done much to encourage children and young musicians to like classical music, especially through the international foundation he created in New York in 2008.
Lang Lang, which means "brilliance of the sky", was born in Shenyang, China, and is of Manchu ethnicity. His father Lang Guoren (郎国任) is also a musician, who plays the erhu. At the age of two, Lang watched the "Tom and Jerry" episode "The Cat Concerto" which features the Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 by Franz Liszt. According to Lang, this first contact with Western music is what wanted him to learn piano. He began lessons with Professor Zhu Ya-Fen at age three. At the age of five, he won first place at the Shenyang Piano Competition and played his first public recital.
Lang was later admitted into Beijing's Central Conservatory of Music where he studied under Professor Zhao Ping-Guo. In 1993, he won the Xing Hai Cup Piano Competition in Beijing and, in 1994, got first prize at the fourth International Competition for Young Pianists in Ettlingen, Germany. In 1995, at 13 years old, he played the Op. 10 and Op. 25 études by Chopin at the Beijing Concert Hall and, the same year, got first place at the International Tchaikovsky Competition for Young Musicians in Japan, playing Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2 with the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra in a concert broadcast by NHK Television. When 14, he was a featured soloist at the China National Symphony's inaugural concert, which was broadcast by China Central Television and attended by President Jiang Zemin. The following year he began studies with Gary Graffman and Dick Doran at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.
Lang has won lots of Awards and has been seen by millions of television viewers throughout the world. He appeared in Time Magazine's 2009 list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. In 2008, the Recording Academy named him their Cultural Ambassador to China. More recently, Lang Lang has been chosen as an official worldwide ambassador to the 2010 Shanghai Expo. The United Nations' Children's Fund (UNICEF) chose Lang Lang as an International Goodwill Ambassador in 2004. The Chinese government also recognized his achievement by selecting him as a vice-president of the All-China Youth Federation. 
Lang said that his mission is to share classical music around the world, and to train children and young musicians through education. The Financial Times noted that he is "evangelical in his efforts to spread the popularity of classical music." In October 2008, he launched the Lang Lang International Music Foundation in New York with the support of the Grammys and UNICEF. In May 2009, Lang Lang and his three chosen scholars from the foundation, aged between 8 and 10 years old, performed together on "The Oprah Winfrey Show" in connection with her search for the world's "smartest and most talented kids."
In June 2011, Lang Lang became a global ambassador for Telefónica.

An inflow is a river that leads to a lake or some other body of water. The inflow gives the lake a supply of water. If lakes have no way of getting water added to them, they will eventually dry up through evaporation. 
Some lakes are big enough that they can stay full through rain instead of inflows. An example of such a lake is the Great Salt Lake in Utah.

Steinway &amp; Sons

Steinway & Sons, also known as Steinway, () is an American-German piano company. It was founded in 1853 in Manhattan, New York City, by German immigrant Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg (later known as Henry E. Steinway). The employees were mostly German immigrants. The company's growth led to the opening of a factory in Queens, New York City, and a factory in Hamburg, Germany. The factory in Queens supplies the Americas and the factory in Hamburg supplies the rest of the world.
Steinway is a prominent piano company making pianos of high quality. Many inventions within piano development have been made at the Steinway factories. Steinway has been granted 126 patents in piano making – the first patent was granted in 1857. The company's share of the high-end grand piano market is over 80 percent.
Steinway pianos have got many awards. One of the first is a gold medal in 1855 at the American Institute Fair at the New York Crystal Palace. From 1855 to 1862, Steinway pianos got 35 gold medals. Many awards and recognitions followed, for example 3 medals at the world's fair of 1867 in Paris. The European part of the company holds a royal warrant of appointment to Queen Elizabeth II.
Steinway pianos are made at the factories in Hamburg and Queens. In addition to the flagship Steinway piano line, Steinway markets two cheaper brands of piano. They are sold under the secondary brand names "Boston" and "Essex". The Boston brand is for the mid-level market and the Essex brand is for the entry-level market. Boston and Essex pianos are designed by Steinway engineers. To take advantage of lower costs of part production and labor, they are made in Asia by other piano makers under the supervision of Steinway employees.

Lamian

Lamian () is a type of Chinese noodle. It is made by stretching and folding the dough into strands. The twisting and later stretching of the strips of dough happens because of the weight of the dough. The strands can be made in many lengths and thicknesses depending on how many times it is stretched and folded. The "Songshi yangsheng bu" (宋氏養生部), which was written by Song Xu around 1504, has the earliest description of how to make lamian.
Literally, lamian means "pulled noodles" (the Chinese word "la" (拉) means to pull, which is how the dough is made into long thin noodles, mian (面)). Lamian dishes are usually served in beef or mutton soup. Sometimes the noodles can be stir-fried (chaomian (炒面)) and served with a tomato-like sauce.

Inventions and Sinfonias (Bach)

The Inventions and Sinfonias (1720; revised 1723) are 30 pieces of keyboard music composed by Johann Sebastian Bach. They are sometimes known as the Two and Three Part Inventions. Bach arranged the two groups of pieces in order of ascending key. Each group covers the eight major and seven minor keys. Bach wrote them as exercises and study pieces for his 12 year old son, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach. The 1720 versions are found in the boy's "Little Keyboard Book" of 1722. The invention and sinfonias are often used as preparation for two volumes of Bach's "The Well-Tempered Clavier".
Bach wrote in the preface to the printed edition of the "Inventions and Sinfonias": "Honest method, by which the amateurs of the keyboard – especially, however, those desirous of learning – are shown a clear way not only (1) to learn to play cleanly in two parts, but also, after further progress, (2) to handle three obligate parts correctly and well; and along with this not only to obtain good inventions (ideas) but to develop the same well; above all, however, to achieve a cantabile style in playing and at the same time acquire a strong foretaste of composition."

List of Detroit Red Wings players

The Detroit Red Wings are a professional ice hockey team based in Detroit, Michigan, United States. They are members of the Central Division of the National Hockey League's (NHL) Western Conference. The Red Wings franchise has been a part of the NHL since 1926, making them one of the "Original Six" clubs. Originally named the Detroit Cougars, team was renamed to the Detroit Falcons in 1930; in 1932, the team's name was changed to the Detroit Red Wings and has remained the same since.
Since its creation, the team has had 36 captains, including Hall of Famers Sid Abel, Ted Lindsay and Red Kelly. Six players have had the honor of having their jersey number officially retired from play; one of them is Steve Yzerman, who played for the Red Wings from 1983 to 2006, and was the longest-serving captain in North American major league sports, with a tenure of 19 years. Yzerman led his team to three Stanley Cups and was the recipient of several awards, including the Lester B. Pearson Award and Lester Patrick Trophy for his outstanding play and contributions to the sport. Thirty-five other players have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.
As of the conclusion of the 2010–11 NHL season, the Red Wings have made the Stanley Cup playoffs for 20 consecutive seasons, the longest post-season streak for a single team in all of North American major professional sports. Gordie Howe holds the franchise records for the most points (with 1809) and for the most goals (with 786). Howe was a member of a Stanley Cup-winning team four times, all with the Red Wings. As of the conclusion of the 2010–11 season, 869 players have played for the franchise; of them, 89 of them are goaltenders, while 780 are skaters.

The Nightingale (Andersen)

"The Nightingale" is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. It was published in 1844 in Andersen's "New Fairy Tales" "(Nye Eventyr)" with "The Angel", "The Sweethearts", and "The Ugly Duckling". The critics liked these stories. Andersen's inspiration for "The Nightingale" was Tivoli Gardens, an amusement park with Chinese decorations in Copenhagen which opened in the summer of 1843. Another inspiration was Jenny Lind, a Swedish opera singer. Andersen was infatuated with her. She was known as the "Swedish Nightingale". Andersen began writing the tale on 11 October 1843 and completed it within 24 hours. 
The nightingale is the best thing of all in the lands of the Emperor of China. The Emperor orders one brought to him. The bird charms him with her song. One day the Emperor of Japan sends the Emperor of China a mechanical bird decorated with jewels. The toy is wound up. Its song delights the Emperor. He neglects the real nightingale. She flies away to the forest. The toy bird breaks down. The Emperor becomes deathly ill. The nightingale returns to the palace. She sings and Death departs. The Emperor recovers.

French Suites

The French Suites are six suites composed by Johann Sebastian Bach between 1722 and 1725. They were written to be played on the harpsichord or clavichord. A suite is a group of dances. Bach did not call them "French Suites". That title was given to the group by someone else. They were called the "French Suites" to distinguish them from another group of suites by Bach called the "English Suites". 
The "French Suites" are largely based on Italian models, and are written in the keys of D minor, C minor, B minor, E-flat major, G major, and E major. All six suites open with an Allemagne and are followed by a Courante and a Sarabande. All six suites end with a Gigue (jig). Between the Sarabande and the Gigue are found a variety of dances that include Minuets, Bourrées, Gavottes, and others. 
There is no definitive manuscript. The ornamentation varies from one manuscript to another. Two other suites one in A minor and the other in E-flat major sometimes appear in the manuscripts. Bach's "French Overture" is also a suite but is not connected to the "French Suites".

<doc id="331012" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=331012" title="Cultigen">
Cultigen

A cultigen is a plant that is the result of artificial selection by humans. Liberty Hyde Bailey, an American botanist was the first to use the term, in 1918. Bailey noticed that the classification Linné introduced for plants was not useful for classifying plants which came from human cultivation and selection. He called the plants which grow in the wild without human selection indigens. A cultigen was: " ... a domesticated group of which the origin may be unknown... [It has] such characters as to separate it from known indigens, and is probably not represented by any type specimen or exact description". The point is that a cultigen cannot always be placed in the traditional Linnean system of botanical classification.
Bailey later changed his definition to "Plant or group known only in cultivation; presumably originating under domestication; contrast with indigen", which is the definition used above. Examples of cultigens are maize and cabbage.
Cultigen and cultivar may be confused with one-another. Cultigen is a general-purpose term encompassing not only plants with cultivar names but others as well (see introductory text above). Cultivar is a formal classification category in the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP).
Although in his 1923 paper Bailey used only the rank of species for the cultigen, it was clear to him that many domesticated plants were more like botanical varieties than species and so he established a new classification category for these, the cultivar, generally assumed to be a contraction of the words “cultivated” and “variety”. He defined cultivar in his 1923 paper as: 
This definition and understanding of cultivar has changed over time.
The definition has been discussed:

Stability

Stability is a property of many systems. It means being at rest, not liable to change. In mechanics and dynamics, a system is stable (has stability) if it will not change motion of its own accord, and will resist small efforts to change its direction or position.
Thus an airliner in flight is dynamically stable, and will keep going in the same direction even when buffeted by uneven air pressure (wind). To change its direction, its control system must be altered. On the other hand, a fighter plane is unstable, and must be controlled at all times by a combination of the pilot and a computer.
Most nuclear isotopes are unstable, but the world is mostly made of stable ones.

Type specimen

In biology, a type specimen is a particular specimen to which a scientific name is formally attached. For this purpose a specimen is something that can be kept, unchanging, for a long time (for centuries). A specimen may be an organism, a part of an organism, or many small organisms together. 
Preferably a type specimen should be kept where researchers may have a chance to study it. Often, type specimens are kept in museums and the like. A type specimen need not be typical, that is, it need not be representative.
A type specimen can be assigned when a name is first published, or it can be assigned later. Besides type specimens there are other form of types. 
One particular type specimen may have any number of scientific names attached to it. For example the names "Fabaceae" (family), "Faboideae" (subfamily), and "Faba" (genus) all have the same specimen as the type. For any one circumscription, position, and rank of a taxon only one name can be correct (for a genus that includes the type specimens of the names "Vicia" and "Faba", both, the correct name will be "Vicia").

Fusion power

Nuclear fusion is when two atoms merge to form a new one. This reaction generates energy. The idea behind a fusion reactor is to build a nuclear power plant that uses this process to produce electricity. Nowadays, nuclear power plants use nuclear fission to produce energy. Nuclear fission is not the same as nuclear fusion. 
Nuclear fusion is the same type of process the Sun uses to generate heat. The most powerful nuclear weapons also use fusion.
As of 2012, there are no commercial power plants that use this technology; there are a few academic ones; these include the Joint European Torus, in England. This reactor uses a principle called Tokamak. A tokamak uses magnets that are shaped like a doughnut to squish the atoms.

Buddhist crisis

The Buddhist Crisis was a period of political and religious tension in South Vietnam. The crisis was characterized by a series of discriminating acts by the South Vietnamese government and a campaign of civil resistance mainly led by Buddhist monks.
The crisis was started when the President Ngô Đình Diệm banned the flying of the Buddhist flag. That led to the shooting of nine unarmed civilians who were protesting a ban of the Buddhist flag on May 8. The crisis ended when Ngô Đình Diệm was assassinated on November 2, 1963.
A survey said that about 70-90 percent of South Vietnamese people were Buddhist. The President called it biased. A member of the Catholic minority, his government was biased towards Catholics in public service and military promotions, as well as in the allocation of land, business favors and tax concessions etc. Diem once told a high-ranking officer, forgetting that he was a Buddhist, "Put your Catholic officers in sensitive places. They can be trusted." Many officers in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) converted to Catholicism believing that their career prospects depended on it. Many were also refused promotion if they did not convert. Also, the distribution of firearms to village self-defense militias intended to repel Viet Cong guerrillas was done so that weapons were only given to Catholics. Some Catholic priests ran private armies, and in some areas forced conversion and looting, shelling and demolition of pagodas. Some Buddhist villages converted to receive aid or avoid being forcibly resettled by Diem's regime. The Catholic Church enjoyed special exemptions. In 1959, Ngô Đình Diệm dedicated the country to the Virgin Mary. The Vatican flag was usually flown in public services and events while the Buddhist flag was not allowed to be flown in public services and/or events.

Canyoneering or canyoning is a dangerous sport. A person who goes canyoneering is a canyoneer. A canyoneer is a person who walks, swims, or rappels (climbs down ropes) into canyons. Sometimes these canyons are very deep and very narrow. Canyons that are very narrow are called "slot canyons". 
Canyoneering can be dangerous. Sometimes canyons flood (fill with water) when it rains. Accidents can also happen when a canyoneer is climbing down ropes. The rope can break or the canyoneer can slip. Sometimes canyons are too narrow to walk through, so you have to go back. Also, sometimes the water in canyons is so cold you can get sick. Many people have died in canyons.

Mikhail Fokine

Mikhail Fokine ( – 22 August 1942) was a Russian choreographer and dancer. He was born in St Petersburg, the son of a prosperous middle-class merchant. At the age of nine, he was accepted into the St Petersburg Imperial Ballet School. In 1898, on his 18th birthday, he debuted on the stage of the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre in "Paquita", with the Imperial Russian Ballet. In 1902, he became a teacher with the ballet school. 
Fokine hoped to go beyond the older ballet traditions. To him virtuoso ballet techniques were not an end in themselves, but a means of expression. He believed that many of the ballets of his time used costuming and mime which did not reflect the themes of the ballets. Therefore, he tried to strip ballets of their artificial miming and outdated costumes. In addition, as a choreographer, he started a reform that took ballerinas out of their pointe shoes. Also, he experimented with a freer use of the arms and torso. He presented his reformist ideas to the management of the Imperial theatre, but did not get their support. Some of his early works include the ballet "Acis and Galatea" (1905) and "The Dying Swan" (1907), which was a solo dance for Anna Pavlova, choreographed to the music of Saint-Saëns' "Le Cygne". 
In 1909, Sergei Diaghilev invited Fokine to become the choreographer of his Ballets Russes in Paris. Fokine broke off the collaboration in 1912, jealous of Diaghilev's close relationship with Vaslav Nijinsky. He moved to Sweden in 1918 and later established his home in New York City, where he founded a ballet school and continued to appear with his wife, Vera Fokina. He became a United States citizen in 1932. Fokine died in New York on 22 August 1942.
Fokine staged more than 70 ballets in Europe and the United States. His best known works were "Chopiniana" (later revised as "Les Sylphides"), "Le Carnaval" and "Le Pavillon d'Armide". Among his works for the Ballets Russes were "The Firebird", "Petrushka", "Le Spectre de la Rose" and "Daphnis et Chloé". Also, for the Ballets Russes, he created a ballet out of Rimsky-Korsakov's "Scheherazade". His pieces are still performed by the leading ballet troupes of the world.

Lasseter's Reef

Lasseter's Reef was a legendary rich gold deposit that was said to be in remote central Australia. A prospector, Harold Bell Lasseter, claimed to have discovered the site in 1897. But Lasseter forgot the exact location of it. He died when he went back into the desert to look for it again. The gold's location remains a mystery—nobody even knows whether it really exists.
Lasseter told the story in 1929. He said that he had found the gold near the border of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This area at the time was uncharted (no maps had been made of it). When he came out of the desert, he spent the next thirty years trying to get people to fund an expedition to go back and look for it. But people ignored him because people were already making fortune from the gold rush at Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. Nobody wanted to risk going into unchartered desert.
But during the Great Depression, people became interested. Lasseter got enough money for an expedition to relocate the gold. But the expedition was hard—there were long distances involved, no maps to guide them, and it was very hard to find water. When the expedition party became lost, the people who went with Lasseter called him a liar. They left him, but Lasseter continued, with one other man. The man later said that Lasseter became crazy in the desert, and he too left him.
Now alone, Lasseter continued in the desert, but eventually became exhausted and dehydrated. He died from exhaustion and malnutrition in early 1931. He was on his way to Uluru or Kata Tjuta. His body was found in March 1931 by a bushman. The story of Lasseter's expedition is known from the stories of his travelling group. The later part of the story is known from Lasseter's diary, which was found on his body. No maps showing the location of the fabled gold reef were ever found. The tale of the reef has become legend. It is probably the most famous "lost mine" legend in Australia.

<doc id="331180" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=331180" title="Le Spectre de la rose">
Le Spectre de la rose

Le Spectre de la rose () is a short ballet. It is about a young girl who dreams of dancing with the spirit of a souvenir rose from her first ball. Jean-Louis Vaudoyer wrote the ballet story. He based it on a verse by Théophile Gautier. 
The dances were designed by Michel Fokine. The music is Hector Berlioz's 1841 orchestration of Carl Maria von Weber's piano music "Afforderung zum Tanz" (). Léon Bakst designed the original sets and costumes. 
The ballet was first presented in Monte Carlo on 19 April 1911. Nijinsky danced The Rose and Tamara Karsavina danced The Young Girl. It was a great success. "Spectre" became internationally famous for the leap (jump) Nijinsky made through a window at the ballet's end. 
In 1911, Ballet Russes producer Sergei Diaghilev hoped to present Nijinsky's ballet "L'Après-midi d'un faune" (). It was not ready for the stage, so he needed another ballet to take its place. That ballet was the idea of writer Jean-Louis Vaudoyer. In 1910, he had sent an idea for a ballet to Ballets Russes set and costume designer Léon Bakst. His idea was based on "Le Spectre de la rose", a verse by Théophile Gautier, and "Afforderung zum Tanz", a work for piano by Carl Maria von Weber. Diaghilev liked Vaudoyer's idea. He thought it could easily take the place of "Faune". He put Vaudoyer's idea into development at once. Diaghilev liked the idea of a ballet based on Gautier's "Spectre" because it could be tied to the centennial of Gautier's birth.
In 1819, Carl Maria von Weber wrote a work for piano called "Afforderung zum Tanz". He also wrote a program for this work about a young man and woman who meet, dance, and part at a ball. The quiet music at the opening of "Afforderung" leads to some beautiful (and busy) waltz tunes before the work ends with the opening music. In 1841, Hector Berlioz orchestrated "Afforderung". This version of the music was used for a short ballet in Weber's opera "Der Freischütz" at the Paris Opéra. It was the Berlioz version that was used for the ballet "Le Spectre de la rose".
Michel Fokine completed the dance in three or four rehearsals. He later wrote that the ballet was almost an improvisation. Grace Robert writes in "The Borzoi Book of Ballets" that "Spectre" is a "pas de deux", but not the sort of "pas de deux" that looks back to complex 19th-century technique and virtuosity. Instead, it is a forward-looking, modern dance of continuous movement and expressiveness. 
Fokine dropped the "port de bras" (position of the arms) of classical ballet in designing the dances for Nijinsky. He used instead curving, tendril-like movements of the arms and fingers. Nijinsky became an androgynous character in this ballet, one showing masculine power in his legs and a feminine delicacy in his arms. Some of his gestures, Ostwalt writes in "Nijinsky: A Leap into Madness", "lent a feminine aura (an invisible force)" to the character.
Nijinsky's silk elastic costume was designed by Léon Bakst. The costume was covered with silk rose petals. Nijinsky was stitched into the costume for every show. After every show, the wardrobe mistress would touch up the petals with her curling iron. Nijinsky's make-up was an important part of the costume design. Romula de Pulszky, later to be his wife, wrote that he looked like "a celestial (heavenly) insect, his eyebrows suggesting some beautiful beetle". Ostwald writes that Nijinsky's costume was like a ballerina's. Sometimes, petals would become loose and fall to the stage. Nijinsky's servant Vasili would collect the petals and sell them as souvenirs. It was said that he built a large house called Le Château du Spectre de la Rose with the profits from the sale of the petals.
The ballet became famous for Nijinsky's leap through one of the two large windows at the back of the stage. The height of the leap was an illusion though. Nijinsky took five running steps from the middle of the stage and leapt through the window on the sixth step. The skirting board (base board) under the window was very low, giving the illusion that the leap was higher than it was. Behind the set, four men caught Nijinsky in the air and put warm towels on him. No one saw Nijinsky land. It looked like he would fly on for all time. The illusion was helped by the conductor in the orchestra pit who held the next to the last chord. In doing so, the leap was given a sense of great length and height.
The curtain rises on a girl's bedroom. The Young Girl comes into the room dressed in a white bonnet and ball gown. She has come home from her first ball. She holds a rose as a souvenir of the evening. She drops into a chair and falls asleep. The rose falls from her fingers to the floor. The Spirit of the Rose is seen at the window. He steps to the floor and nears The Young Girl. Still asleep, she rises and dances with him. He leads her back to the chair, kisses her, then leaps through the window and into the night. The Young Girl awakes and rises. She picks up the rose she dropped and kisses it. The curtain falls.
"Spectre" was first presented on 19 April 1911 by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in the Théâtre de Monte Carlo, Monte Carlo. Tamara Karsavina danced The Young Girl and Nijinsky danced The Rose. Grace Robert writes that "Spectre" was an "immediate success". Diaghilev was surprised; he thought "Spectre" a trifle not worth notice, but the little ballet became one of the most loved productions of the Ballets Russes. 
Many dancers attempted to match Nijinsky as The Rose, but failed. After all, the ballet had been designed for Nijinsky's very special talents. The Young Girl has been called "the forgotten woman of ballet", and, as time passed, the part became routine. By the middle of the 20th century, "Spectre" had become nothing but a stunt ballet: people paid only to see the leap through the window.
"Spectre" was one of the first ballets Rudolph Nureyev danced in the West after leaving Russia. This was for German television in 1961. He first danced The Rose on stage (24 times) in New York City for the Joffrey Ballet's Diaghilev program in 1979. "Spectre" was the last ballet Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn danced together. That was in June 1979, when the ballerina was 60. He danced The Rose in Paris in 1981 and 1982, and last danced the part in August 1987 at the London Coliseum with the Nancy Ballet.
The ballet was first seen in Australia in 1936 when it was part of the Monte Carlo Russian Ballet program. In 1962, Margot Fonteyn danced The Young Girl as part of her 1962 tour of Australia. In 2006, The Australian Ballet presented the ballet as one of three showing the work of Fokine.

Les Sylphides

Les Sylphides () is a ballet choreographed by Michel Fokine to the music of Frederic Chopin. The music was orchestrated by Stravinsky among others. The scenery and costumes were designed by Alexandre Benois. 
The ballet was first performed by the Ballets Russes in Paris at the Théâtre du Châtelet on 2 June 1909. It starred Nijinsky, Tamara Karsavina, Anna Pavlova, and Maria Baldina. The ballet is non-narrative. It does not tell a story. It is a series of dances meant to evoke the atmosphere and ambiance of a romantic ballet.
"Les Sylphides" was developed from a Fokine ballet called "Chopiniana". This ballet was performed in St Petersburg on 21 March 1908. It was a series of imagined scenes from Chopin's life that included a Polish wedding and a ballroom polonaise. It was revised. All characters and any suggestion of a plot were dropped to create instead an evocation of the romantic ballet. 
The revised ballet (still called "Chopiniana") was performed in St Petersburg on 6 April 1908. This second version was costumed in the long white ballet tutu made famous by Marie Taglioni in "La Sylphide". "Chopiniana" was renamed "Les Sylphides" when it was presented in Paris.
"Les Sylphides" generally includes the following musical numbers:

Barbiturate

Barbiturates are a group of drugs that are derivates of Barbituric acid. Adolf von Baeyer was the first to produce Barbituric acid, in 1863. For many years, barbiturates were used as sedatives. Today, their use is very limited in many countries, mainly because they cause addiction and people soon develop a tolerance. People with a drug tolerance will need a higher dosage of the drug to get the same effect as before. After a while, the drug becomes useless for such people.
Barbiturates were once used as a primary treatment for Epilepsy; this is especially true for the substance called Phenobarbitol or Phenobarbitone. The sedative side effect of the drug made it increasingly unpopular, and it is now prescribed less for epilepsy, in favor of other drugs that do not have sedative effects.
Benzodiazepines are another group of drugs, which have sedative properties: They make people sleepy, and help them sleep. In contrast, Barbiturates force people to sleep. In the case of severe sleeping problems which cannot be controlled by other drugs, Barbiturates are sometimes used as off-label drugs.

Kaltukatjara, Northern Territory

Kaltukatjara (') is a town in the southwest of the Northern Territory of Australia. It is also called Docker River in English. It is about 670 km southwest of Alice Springs, and 8 km from the border with Western Australia. In the 2006 census, Kaltukatjara had a population of 355. All of the residents are either Pitjantjatjara, Ngaatjatjarra or Ngaanyatjarra Aboriginal people.
Kaltukatjara is located on the western bank of an ephemeral watercourse called Docker River. It is surrounded by the Petermann Ranges. From the town, the Great Central Road leads eastward to Yulara (196 km) and westward to Warburton (288 km).
While the roads in the town are sealed, roads out of the town are gravel and can be closed for up to a week if it rains. There is an air strip about 4 km north of the town. Power is supplied by three large generators. The water supply is pumped from two underground bores which are about 5 km from the town. Facilities in Kaltukatjara includes both a primary and secondary school, a health clinic, community store, and an old people's home. There is also a Lutheran church.
Kaltukatjara was originally established as an outstation in 1968. It was established so that the Aboriginal people living in missions such as Areyonga could live closer to their homelands. It was also to encourage people to move out of the Ayers Rock–Mt Olga National Park. The settlement was named "Docker River" after the stream that flows through the community. This stream was given its name by the explorer Ernest Giles when he travelled through the area in 1872.
In 1976, the Aboriginal Land Rights Act was passed in the Northern Territory. The Kaltukatjara community was given freehold title over a large block of land in the Territory's southwest corner (see Petermann Aboriginal Land Trust). This allowed families living at Kaltukatjara to spread out over the surrounding country and set up smaller camps on their own ancestral homelands. This movement was part of a larger trend called the "outstation movement". The first two outstations established were Tjuntinanta and Punritjanta. By the end of 1978, a total of 11 outstations had been established. There were 16 by the end of 1981.
The area in which Kaltukatjara is located is known as '. It contains several old sacred sites associated with the (Mulga Seed Dreaming). Part of this Tjukurpa, which is restricted to men, extends east through Uluṟu, where the Wintalyka men became involved in a feud with the Mala people. According to the legend, the Mala had travelled from the north to perform ceremonies at Uluṟu with a sacred artefact. On learning of this artefact, the Wintalyka men invited the Mala men to attend ceremonies at Kikingkura, but the Mala refused. Feeling insulted, the Wintalyka decided to punish the Mala by conjuring an evil spirit to haunt them. At Pulpaiyala, a soakage close to what is now Kaltukatjara, they conjured ', a great and terrifying spirit resembling a dingo. Kurpany chased the Mala men from Uluṟu and off across the desert to the south.
Kaltukatjara is governed by Kaḻṯukatjara Community Council, a local government council with 12 members. The community also serves about 30 outstations, most of which are not permanently occupied. They are spread over a large area around the Petermann Ranges. Only two outstations are funded by the council: Tjauwata, about 5 km to the east, and Kunapula, about 46 km southeast. Most of the outstations on the eastern side of the border are owned by Pitjantjatjara families. Those in Western Australia are mostly owned by Ngaanyatjarra people.

It ran on the radio until 1957. The program then ran on television's NBC from 1956 to 1964. The program is something of an early "reality show". The program was so popular that NBC increased its running time from 30 minutes to 45 minutes. 
The format was simple. Host Jack Bailey interviewed four women contestants. Each told of her personal troubles. These troubles might involve a terminally sick child at home, a husband disabled and out of work, or the need for a hearing aid or a new washing machine. The audience chose the winner by applauding their favorite. She who received the greatest amount of applause as registered by the "applause meter" was Queen for a Day. The winner was crowned, escorted by attendants to a throne, and given not only what she wanted, but juicy prizes like high-end appliances, upscale fashions, and exotic vacation trips as well. Mark Evanier, veteran television writer, writes that "Queen for a Day" was "one of the most ghastly shows ever produced" and further stated it was "tasteless, demeaning to women, demeaning to anyone who watched it, cheap, insulting and utterly degrading to the human spirit."

<doc id="331302" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=331302" title="Releaser">
Releaser

A releaser is a stimulus from one animal to another, which causes a particular response. The releaser, or sign stimulus triggers an innate releasing mechanism in the receiver. The receiver then does its response, the fixed action pattern (FAP).
This kind of system is inherited by both animals. Example: a fledgling bird does its releaser, say it squawks and opens its beak wide, showing bright red inside throat. This triggers the adult to cough up food stored in its gullet. Both 'partners' are behaving instinctually with inherited behaviours: these are not learnt during life. A FAP can truly be said to be 'hard-wired': a specific stimulus nearly always results in the same behavioral response.
Another behavious system is the 'dances' of water birds such as the Great Crested Grebe. They pair for life, and 'dance' whenever a pair meet up after an absence, and on other occasions. The dances are quite complex, and were first described fully by Julian Huxley. Here the meeting is the releaser, and both partners do the fixed action pattern. The function of the system is a little unclear, but it has something to do with reinforcing the pair's bond.
It is not necessary for both partners to benefit, nor to be of the same species. Some moths instantly fold their wings and drop to the ground if they encounter bat ultrasonic signals. This helps helps the moths, but obviously not the bats. In turn, some bats turn of the sound blips when they hear a moth, and glide in the last few feet. This also is an inherited behaviour.

The Copper Age was a time period between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age. It is also named "Chalcolithic" ( "khalkos" "copper" + "lithos" "stone"). 
In the Bronze Age, people added tin to copper to make bronze, an alloy which is much harder than either tin or copper. During the Copper Age, this fact became known, but was not much used because tin was scarce. 
The Vinča culture was the first to develop the knowledge and skills to process copper, in the late 6th mililenium BC. 
Edged weapons such as knives, swords, spearheads, and axes were made of copper, as were brooches, pins, belt boxes and vessels for food and drink.

Gabbert was born in Ballwin, Missouri, USA and went to Parkway West High School, where he played high school football. In his sophomore season, he threw for about 1,100 yards and 11 touchdowns as a first-year starter. As a junior, he had 1,523 yards and 20 scores and also added 458 yards and 8 TDs rushing. He threw 623 passing yards and five touchdowns as a senior, despite an injured foot that limited him to four games. He was considered one of the best players entering college at his position.
Gabbert started his college football career as only a third string player. Here are his statistics with the Missouri Tigers:
After an impressive showing at the combine, Gabbert was taken 10th overall by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2011 NFL Draft. Gabbert, who to his credit was playing on a team that had done very poorly the past several years, had a bad season in 2011. He was sacked 40 times (3rd most in league history), fumbled 14 times, and threw only 12 touchdown passes next to eleven interceptions as Jacksonville's bad luck continued. Analysts noted how Gabbert's height decreased when he threw, which is the opposite of what is supposed to happen.
On March 11, 2014, Gabbert got traded to the San Francisco 49ers.

The show mainly has positive reviews with PopMatters said the show was "stunningly effective" and praised "its mix of spirituality and science, familial and global struggles." They also noted that "The boy’s narration, unnervingly matter-of-fact about the nature of the universe, takes on more power when he reveals that in 11 years, he has never spoken a word."
The New York Post said "If you can’t get enough of number sequences and universal cylindrical patterns that constantly repeat, then for sure you’ll repeat the pattern of watching Fox’s new show...It is intriguing, and it’s great to have Sutherland back on TV" but felt "frankly, it’s awfully complicated."
The Chicago Sun Times said the show "operates on the mind-blowing premise that people around the world are linked to one another and their lives intersect — with potentially major repercussions." They finished the review saying it "delivers a suspenseful ride around the world, peppered with some tear-jerking moments. The bar has been set high. Here’s hoping “Touch” continues to reach it."
Kiefer Sutherland's performance has good reviews, with many critics saying "He plays the part with such a combination of intensity and subtlety that we are drawn deep into Martin’s suffering, and rather than judging him, we feel with him. Every trial is etched in his face. He imbued Jack Bauer with similar stoicism, but Martin seems less resilient, more distressed."
The Los Angeles Times gave the show a 40 of 100, which was the lowest review along with Philadelphia Daily News which was also 40 of 100.

Corners are a type of defensive back often assigned to cover wide receivers. Corners can rush the passer, intercept balls, tackle, and deflect passes. Their main job is to stop the receivers from catching the ball. In "zone defense", corners are assigned to a specific area of the field, in which they cannot let anyone make a catch.

Terrell Owens

Terrell Eldorado Owens (; born on December 7, 1973, nicknamed "T.O.") is an American football wide receiver for the Allen Wranglers of the Indoor Football League, of where he is also a co-owner. A six-time Pro Bowl selection, Owens holds or shares several National Football League records, and features in the all-time top-five in several receiving categories, including yards and touchdowns. Owens played college football for the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga.
Owens is also well known for the controversy he brings on and off the field. At one point, there were rumors that he attempted suicide, which Owens denied. Owens is now broke.
Owens played college football for the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. He wore #80 to honor Jerry Rice, whom Owens loved to watch as a child. Owens caught 38 passes for 724 yards and eight touchdowns during his sophomore year, and 34 passes for 357 yards and three touchdowns during his junior year. Owens faced double coverage every week during his senior year, and so only had 43 receptions for 667 yards and one touchdown. He also played in the Senior Bowl.
In his NFL career (lasted from 1996 to 2010), Owens showed much talent on the five teams he played for. However, he sparked even more controversy (arguments). Owens was known for his trash-talking, over-the top touchdown celebrations (often more to rub it in on the opponent than to fire his own team up), and off-field drama, where he has help several shirtless workouts, hosts a reality show (The T.O. Show), and has modeled for clothing companies. Despite all the attention he got, Owens has never won a Super Bowl. Owens is the only player to have scored on all 32 teams in the league. (He has actuall scored on them all at least twice.)
Owens was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the 2nd Round of the 1996 NFL Draft. This united Owens with Jerry Rice. Owens's first career score came on a 45-yard touchdown from Steve Young against the Cincinnati Bengals to tie the game in a win. Owens later emerged as the #1 threat in San Francisco.
In 2000, Owens mocked (teased) the Dallas Cowboys after scoring twice from quarterback Jeff Garcia. Since the Cowboys were at home, Owens stood in celebration on the Dallas star twice. It resulted in Cowboys runningback Emmitt Smith slamming his helmet into the turf to get even after he himself scored. Owens scored for a second time, and went back to the star. However, defensive back George Teague knocking Owens off. Owens was called for unsportsmanlike conduct and was suspended for a week by his head coach, while Teague was ejected by the officials.
Later moments with the 49ers included Owens grabbing pom-poms from 49ers cheerleaders and cheering with them, and taking a sharpie out of his sock to sign a touchdown ball.
After a spat with some 49ers front office members, Owens and the team decided to part ways after the 2003 season. Philadelphia quarterback Donovan McNabb wanted Owens to be an Eagle, as did many Eagles fans. Owens was actually traded to the Baltimore Ravens, but Owens challenged the 49ers' right to make the trade and made it clear he did not want to go to Baltimore. Owens eventually won the case, and was sent to the Philadelphia Eagles after the Ravens, 49ers, and Eagles agreed to a rare 3-team trade.
Owens had a great season in 2004 on the field (caught 14 TDs), despite a broken leg by Cowboys safety Roy Williams. Owens's main celebration was copying the dance of Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis in a win against the Ravens. T.O. helped the Philadelphia Eagles to an appearance in Super Bowl XXXIX. However, Owens's controversy was at its high point. He had several feuds with McNabb and the Eagles managament. He was suspended b Phili for most of the 2005 season. That was the last of Owens's time with the Eagles.
Owens signed a three year contract with the Dallas Cowboys in 2006. Owens (and star QB Tony Romo) enjoyed a good three years. Notable touchdown celebrations while with the Cowboys were sleeping on a ball and grabbing a fan's popcorn to dump down his facemask. The only other form of controversy while Owens was with the Cowboys was when he spit in the face of cornerback DeAngelo Hall, who had, according to Owens, been ""in his face all day." Owens was fined, but the two players made up with the help of Deion Sanders. Owens produced well through the rest of his time in Dallas, but was released after the 2008 season.
Owens signed with the Buffalo Bills in 2009. He played fairly well during his lone season in Buffalo. He also caught a 98-yard touchdown pass, a career long. Owens, however, did not produce as Buffalo hoped when the payed him, and so he was not resigned. However, Owens was credited for not complaining at all publicly, especially since it would have been very easy because the Bills were doing so poorly.
With the Cincinnati Bengals, Owens and friend Chad Ochocinco, who had the same kind of touchdown celebrations, were on the same team. Owens led the Bengals (including Ochocinco) with 983 receiving yards, but was injured and missed the last two games of the 2010 season. Owens was not cleared to play until October of 2011. No one wanted to sign him.
Owens signed with the Allen Wranglers of the Indoor Football League for their spring season of 2012. He was also their co-owner. Owens caught three touchdowns in his first game for the Wranglers. However, reports surfaced during this time that Owens was broke.
Terrell Owens was born to L.C. Russel and Marilyn Heard in Alexander City, Alabama. When Terrell was very young, he lived with his mother and grandmother. He grew up with three other siblings. He enjoyed watching football, especially his favorite player, Jerry Rice. However, Owens’ grandmother did not allow him to play sports until high school. (Owens attended Benjamin Russell High School, where he did very well in football, baseball, and basketball.)
Terrell Owens is married and is now a father to sons Terique, Atlin, plus daughters Kylee, and Dasha.

Burnout

A burnout (also known as a peel out or power brake) is the practice of keeping a vehicle still (or close to) and spinning its wheels, causing the tires to heat up and smoke due to friction.
The origins of burnouts can be traced to drag racing, where they have a practical purpose: drag racing tires perform better at higher temperatures. A burnout is the fastest way to raise tire temperature before a race. It also cleans the tires of any debris and lays down a layer of rubber near the starting line for better traction. Drag race tracks sometimes use specially-reserved, wet-surface areas (burnout boxes) for burnouts.
Burnouts are also common in informal street racing, usually for show value. As with all street racing activities, burnouts on public property are illegal in most countries but the severity of punishments vary. In New South Wales, for example, police have the power to confiscate the offending vehicle for 3 months for a first offense. 
In March 2010, British Formula 1 World Champion, Lewis Hamilton had his Mercedes car impounded for allegedly performing a burnout in Melbourne, Australia while leaving the Albert Park Grand-Prix Circuit.
Burnouts are also sometimes performed by winning drivers at the end of NASCAR races to celebrate their victory.
Burnouts in front wheel drive vehicles are likely to result in damage to the wehicle.  They are usually achieved by holding the emergency brake (e-brake) to lock up the rear tires while flooring the gas pedal.  
To burnout in a rear wheel drive vehicle the driver usually has to press the gas and brake pedals at the same time.  The brake pedal will require modulation The goal is to allow the rear tires to spin while holding the car in place with the front wheels remaining motionless. At a certain point of balance, the front brakes will prevent the car from moving forward while the rear brakes will have insufficient grip to keep the wheels from spinning, because engine power is transferred to the rear wheels only.
It is possible to make rear-wheel drive burnouts easier by installing "line locks", devices which allow fluid pressure on the front brakes to be maintained while releasing the pedal to free the rear brakes. This is useful in a manual transmission vehicle, where it can be quite difficult to manipulate the clutch, brake and gas pedals simultaneously. Line locks also reduce wear to the rear brakes, a common problem otherwise.
Burnouts are most difficult to perform in four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive cars, as they have better traction than FWD or RWD vehicles. It requires significantly more powerful engines to break all four tires loose at the same time and the tires will spin for only a short while before all four gain traction.

Scarecrow

A scarecrow is a figure usually made of sticks. It looks like a human being. It is dressed in old clothes. A farmer puts a scarecrow in a field after he has planted seeds. He hopes the scarecrow will frighten birds away from the field. Some birds such as crows and sparrows eat the seeds the farmer plants. He does not want the birds to do this. If the birds eat the seeds, the farmer will not have a big crop of things to eat. 
Scarecrows are sometimes characters in stories. Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote a story about a scarecrow who comes to life in "Feathertop". The most famous storybook scarecrow is probably the one in "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" by L. Frank Baum.

Joseph Kony

Joseph Kony (pronounced ; born 1961) is a Ugandan guerrilla group leader. He is the head of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). While he had a lot of support from the public, the LRA turned against its supporters. They said that they did this to "purify" the Acholi people and turn Uganda into a theocracy ruled by the Ten Commandments. 
The LRA is known for the very bad things it does to civilians. Two of these things are murder and rape.
The LRA has become known for what it does against the people of several countries. Some of these countries are northern Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, South Sudan, and Sudan. It has stolen and forced about 66,000 children to fight for them. 
In 2005, Kony was accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands. He has not yet been captured.
Kony was born in 1961 in Odek. Odek is a village which is east of Gulu in northern Uganda. He is a member of the Acholi people. His father was called Luizi Obol. He was a farmer. His mother was called Nora. Kony had a good relationship with his siblings, but if they had arguments, he would quickly fight back. Also, when challenged he would often use physical violence. Kony was an altar boy for several years. However, he stopped going to church around the age of 15 and also dropped out of school.
As a teenager, Kony was being trained to be the village witch doctor by Jamie Brow, his older brother. When Jamie died, Kony took over the position.
On October 6, 2005, the International Criminal Court (ICC) said that the arrest had been given for five members of the Lord's Resistance Army. These were for crimes against humanity. On the next day Ugandan defence minister Amama Mbabazi said that the warrants include Kony, his deputy Vincent Otti, and LRA commanders Raska Lukwiya, Okot Odiambo, and Dominic Ongwen. The Ugandan military says that the Ugandan army killed Lukwiya on August 12, 2006. The BBC heard that Otti had been killed on October 2, 2007, at Kony's home.

Little Nemo

Little Nemo is the main fictional character in a series of weekly comic strips by Winsor McCay. These comic strips appeared in the "New York Herald" and "New York American" newspapers from October 15, 1905 – July 23, 1911 and September 3, 1911 – July 26, 1914. The strip was first called "Little Nemo in Slumberland" and then "In the Land of Wonderful Dreams". Little Nemo in Slumberland came back for a short time from 1924-1927. 
The comic was about the dreams of a little boy named Nemo. His name means "nobody" in Latin. In the first strips he tried to go to Slumberland. That was the land of King Morpheus. The King wanted Nemo as a friend for his daughter, the Princess. The last picture in each strip always was Nemo waking up, in or near his bed. Then the grownups were angry with him, because he had waken them up. Or they comforted him because he was sad.
In the earliest strips, the dream would end because of a disaster that could hurt or kill Nemo. These events would be something like falling from a bridge, becoming a monkey, or becoming 90 years older. Later on Nemo reached Slumberland. Then "Flip" always woke him up. Flip wore a hat that had 'Wake Up' written on it. Other characters in the strip were Dr. Pill, The Imp, the Candy Kid, and Santa Claus.
The strip was not a very big success from 1905 to 1927. Most comics readers liked the slapstick actions of the "Katzenjammer Kids", "Happy Hooligan", and "Buster Brown" (other comic strips) more than the surreal (not real) fantasy of Nemo. From the 1970s until now, people like the strip more. Many of the original strips were found at a comic strip studio in 1966. They were shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
Very special of Nemo was that the pictures were very difficult, had many details and beautiful colours. Also the story was special, because it was a fast story and had many strange characters and places.

<doc id="331614" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=331614" title="Krazy Kat">
Krazy Kat

Krazy Kat is a comic strip created by cartoonist George Herriman. It was published daily in newspapers between 1913 and 1944. It first appeared in the "New York Evening Journal". Its owner, William Randolph Hearst, was a major booster for the strip throughout its run. 
The "Krazy Kat" characters were introduced in another Herriman strip "The Dingbat Family". The phrase "Krazy Kat" originated there. It was the mouse's way of describing the cat. The strip is set in Herriman's vacation home of Coconino County, Arizona. "Krazy Kat" is mixture of offbeat surrealism, innocent playfulness, and poetic, idiosyncratic language. 
The strip focuses on the curious love triangle between Krazy Kat, a carefree, simple-minded cat; Ignatz Mouse; and police dog, Offissa Bull Pupp. Krazy has an unrequited love for the mouse. Ignatz despises Krazy. He throws bricks at Krazy's head. Krazy thinks this is a sign of the Mouse's affection. Krazy utters grateful replies such as "Li'l dollink, allus f'etful". Offissa Pupp is Coconino County's administrator of law and order. He makes it his mission to interfere with Ignatz's brick-tossing plans. He locks the mouse in the county jail.
The detailed characterization and Herriman's visual and verbal creativity made "Krazy Kat" one of the first comics to be praised by intellectuals. The strip was treated as "serious" art. Critic Gilbert Seldes wrote at length about the strip in 1924, calling it "the most amusing and fantastic and satisfactory work of art produced in America today." Poet E. E. Cummings admired Herriman and wrote the introduction to the first collection of the strip in book form. "Krazy Kat" was only a modest success during its initial run. In more recent years, many modern cartoonists have cited "Krazy Kat" as a major influence on their own work.

Pierre-Simon Laplace

Pierre-Simon Laplace (23 March 1749 – 5 March 1827), later Marquis de Laplace, was a French mathematician and astronomer.
His work helped to develop mathematical astronomy and statistics. His five volume "Mécanique Céleste" (Celestial Mechanics) (1799–1825) was a key work. In it, he changed the geometric study of classical mechanics to one based on calculus, which meant it could tackle a wider range of problems. In statistics, the so-called Bayesian interpretation of probability was mainly developed by Laplace. 
He invented Laplace's equation, and pioneered the Laplace transform which is used in many branches of mathematical physics. The Laplacian differential operator, widely used in mathematics, is also named after him.
Laplace's view on the origin of the Solar System is still ours today. He recognised, like Newton, that the key force in the Solar System was gravitation. Gravitation caused the coming together of gas and small particles into one central mass (which became the Sun) with other smaller groups (the planets), held to the central star by gravitation.
Laplace proved that the small irregularities in planetary motion were self-correcting, and that the solar system as a whole was stable. This meant the solar system was going to exist in the present state for a very long time. He worked out some problems in the moon's orbit, and how the moon caused tides.
Laplace also came close to getting the concept of the black hole. He pointed out that there could be massive stars whose gravity is so great that not even light could escape from their surface (see escape velocity). Laplace also speculated that some of the nebulae revealed by telescopes may not be part of the Milky Way and might actually be galaxies themselves. Thus, he anticipated Edwin Hubble's major discovery 100 years in advance.

Great Slave Lake

Great Slave Lake () is the second-largest lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada. It is the deepest lake in North America at 614m, and the ninth-largest lake in the world. It is long and wide. It covers . The lake shares its name with the Slavey First Nations. Towns on the lake include: Yellowknife, Hay River, Behchoko, Fort Resolution, Lutselk'e, Hay River Reserve, Dettah and N'Dilo.
North American Aboriginal Peoples were the first people to live around the lake. They built communities including Dettah, which still exists today. British fur trader Samuel Hearne explored the area in 1771 and crossed the frozen lake. He named it Lake Athapuscow. This was a misunderstanding of the name Athabaska. In 1897-1898, the American frontiersman Charles "Buffalo" Jones traveled to the Arctic Circle.
In the 1930s, gold was discovered there, and the city of Yellowknife was founded. It became the capital of the Northwest Territories. In 1967, an all-season highway was built around the lake, originally an extension of the Mackenzie Highway but now known as Yellowknife Highway or Highway 3. On January 24, 1978, a Soviet Radar Ocean Reconnaissance Satellite, named Kosmos 954 fell from orbit and broke apart. The satellite had an on board nuclear reactor. Pieces of the nuclear core fell near the Great Slave Lake. 90% of the nuclear debris was recovered by a group called Operation Morning Light. They included people from both the United States and Canada.
The Hay, Slave and Taltson Rivers enter the lake. The Mackenzie River flows out. The western shore has forests, but the east shore and northern arm are tundra-like. The southern and eastern shores reach the edge of the Canadian Shield. The Great Slave Lake remains from a large post-glacial lake along with other lakes such as the Great Bear and Athabasca.
The main western part of the lake is a bowl with a surface area of and a volume of . This main portion has a maximum depth of and a mean depth of . To the east, McLeod Bay () and Christie Bay () are much deeper, with a maximum recorded depth in Christie Bay of .
There is the nesting site of a flock of Whooping Cranes south of Great Slave Lake, in a remote corner of Wood Buffalo National Park.

Johann Friedrich Blumenbach

Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (11 May 1752 – 22 January 1840) was a German physician, naturalist, physiologist and anthropologist. He was one of the first to explore the study of mankind as an aspect of natural history. He used comparative anatomy to classify human races, of which he listed five.
Blumenbach divided the human species into five races in 1779. Later he based them on the anatomy of the human skull. Blumenbach's work included the description of sixty skulls published as "Decas craniorum" (Göttingen 1790–1828). This was a founding work for other scientists.
He called the five races (1793/1795): 
He did not think other races were inferior to the Caucasian race, and were potentially good members of society. 
Anatomical study led him to the conclusion that 'individual Africans differ as much, or even more, from other individual Africans as Europeans differ from Europeans'. Furthermore he thought that Africans were not inferior to the rest of mankind 'concerning healthy faculties of understanding, excellent natural talents and mental capacities'.
"Finally, I am of opinion that after all these numerous instances I have brought together of negroes of capacity, it would not be difficult to mention entire well-known provinces of Europe, from out of which you would not easily expect to obtain off-hand such good authors, poets, philosophers, and correspondents of the Paris Academy; and on the other hand, there is no so-called savage nation known under the sun which has so much distinguished itself by such examples of perfectibility and original capacity for scientific culture, and thereby attached itself so closely to the most civilized nations of the earth, as the Negro."
These ideas were far less influential. His ideas were adopted by other researchers and encouraged scientific racism. Blumenbach's work was used by many biologists and comparative anatomists in the nineteenth century who were interested in the origin of races: Wells, Lawrence, Prichard, Huxley and William Flower are good examples of his influence on human biology.
Regarding human origins, Blumenbach believed the first humans had originated in Asia.

Arkose is generally formed from the weathering of igneous or metamorphic rocks. These are usually granite rocks, which contain a lot of feldspar and quartz. Arkose is often found with conglomerate deposits where the sediment is made of granite. The central Australian monolith Uluru is made of late Neoproterozoic/Cambrian arkose, deposited by the erosion of a granite-based mountain range.

Linebackers can appear in different formations, or looks. In a 4-3 defense, there are three linebackers; usually two OLBs and a MLB in the middle.

"The Birth of a Nation" made early use of advanced camera and storytelling techniques. It was a very popular movie. It was also a very controversial movie. The movie showed African Americans and White anti-racists in a bad way. It also showed slavery and the Ku Klux Klan as good things. The movie was praised by President Woodrow Wilson. He said it was "history written in lightning". The NAACP boycotted the movie. Griffith responded to all the criticism with another movie, "Intolerance". This movie showed the dangers of prejudice. The movie did not make as much money as "The Birth of a Nation", but the critics liked it. Many of Griffith's later movies were critical successes. They did not make a lot of money. Even so, he is one of the most important figures of early movies. Other famous movies by Griffith include "Orphans of the Storm" and "Broken Blossoms".

Service d'exploitation de la formation aéronautique

The Service d'exploitation de la formation aéronautique (SEFA) was the French national flight school, in nine places in France and managed by the "direction générale de l'aviation civile" (DGAC). It merged with French Civil Aviation University the 1st of January 2011.
SEFA is a direct descendant of a long tradition of state involvement in helping to light aviation. By 1936, the Popular Front creates the ""sections d’aviation populaire" (SAP), in order to democratize the flight training for young people and then to train more crew for the French military aviation. In 1946, the "service de l’aviation légère et sportive" (SALS) is created, which purpose is essentially to provide available aircraft and instructors for flying clubs.
In 1955, SALS becomes the "service de la formation aéronautique et des sports aériens" (SFASA), in 1959 the "service de la formation aéronautique, du travail aérien et des transports" (SFATAT), in 1964 it is renamed the "service de la formation aéronautique" (SFA) and finally the "service de la formation aéronautique et du contrôle technique"" (SFACT) in 1976. These designations reflect the successive changes in the organization of the civil aviation administration, but also the direct involvement of the State, in flight training. Thus "national centers" will be created, in 1945, for the gliding activities (Challes-les-Eaux, Beynes, Pont-Saint-Vincent, etc.), and then for the flight in piston aircraft (Carcassonne in 1945, Saint-Yan in 1947), and even skydiving (Biscarosse in 1953).
Over the years, the French civil aviation administration gradually withdraw from its activities in the field of gliding and skydiving.
In 1959, the center of Saint-Yan welcomes the first course of airline pilot students (EPL, "Elève Pilote de ligne", in English airline pilot student), ushering in a new mission of the SEFA : the training of airline pilots. The national centers were attached to the service of the civil aviation administration in charge of training. The creation of a single management structure was needed.
Thus was created the SEFA in 1993, bringing together under one organization all the necessary needs to implement the tasks entrusted by the DGAC. The direction of the SEFA moved to Muret in 1996, bringing together all central services previously scattered between Saint-Cyr-l'École and Paris.
Finally, on the 1st of January 2011, the SEFA is merged with the French Civil Aviation University in order to create the biggest European aviation school. All the SEFA activities are now providing under the only acronym ENAC.

Bolshoi Ballet

The Bolshoi Ballet is a ballet company. It is based at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, Russia. It was founded in 1776. It is one of the oldest ballet companies in the world. It achieved worldwide acclaim in the early 20th century when Moscow became the capital of Soviet Russia. The Bolshoi and the Kirov Ballet are recognised as the foremost ballet companies in Russia.
The origin of the Bolshoi is found in the creation of a dance school for a Moscow orphanage in 1773. In 1776, dancers from the school were employed by Prince Pyotr Urusov and the English theatrical entrepreneur Michael Maddox to form part of their new theatre company. They performed in privately owned venues. Later they acquired the Petrovsky Theatre. The theatre would later be rebuilt as today's Bolshoi Theatre.
The early history of the Bolshoi Ballet is very sketchy. The company staged many famous ballets. It struggled to compete with the Imperial Russian Ballet of St Petersburg. It was not until Alexander Gorsky became Ballet Master in 1900 that the company began to develop its own unique identity. The company was acclaimed for productions of new or restaged ballets including, "Don Quixote" (1900), "Coppélia" (1901), "Swan Lake" (1901), "La fille mal gardée" (1903), "Giselle" (1911), "Le Corsaire" (1912) and "La Bayadère" (1917).

Matt Flynn

Matthew Clayton Flynn (born June 20, 1985) is an American football quarterback. He was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the 7th round of the 2008 NFL Draft. He played college football at LSU.
Flynn redshirted the 2003 NCAA Division I-A football season, as did the other LSU quarterback signee, JaMarcus Russell.
In 2004, Flynn was a third string quarterback as a redshirt freshman, behind starter Marcus Randall and backup JaMarcus Russell. He was also LSU's holder on placekicks. Flynn played in all 12 games, but only three games at quarterback. His collegiate first complete throw went to Xavier Carter for a 67-yard touchdown against Mississippi State. Flynn also made a short appearance in the 2004 Capital One Bowl. In that game, he completed 1 of 4 passes for 11 yards in a 25-30 loss against Iowa. He finished the year by completing 4 of 10 passes for 99 yards and 1 TD.
When Randall left the team, Russell and Flynn fought for the starting QB position. Russell got the job. Flynn was the backup. Flynn played in seven games at quarterback for the Tigers in 2005. He completed 27 of 48 passes for 457 yards, 7 touchdowns and 1 interception. In a win over North Texas, Flynn threw 7-of-7 for 139 yards and 3 TDs, all in the fourth quarter. In the 2005 SEC Championship Game against the Georgia Bulldogs, starting quarterback Russell was injured. Flynn finished the game. He was then made the main quarterback for the Tigers in the 2005 Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl against the University of Miami Hurricanes. In that game, he led the Tigers to a 40-3 win over Miami.
Flynn played in seven games as a junior. He completed 12 of 20 passes for 133 yards over the season. He had 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. Both TDs came in a 49-0 win against Kentucky on October 14, 2006.
When Russell was drafted by the Oakland Raiders, Flynn finally became a starter as a fifth-year senior. He started every game that season except the SEC Championship in which he was injured.
Flynn threw a 22 yard TD pass to Demetrius Byrd to win the game against Auburn on October 20, 2007 with 1 second remaining on the clock. LSU won the game 30 - 24.
He then led the Tigers to a 4th quarter comeback against Alabama State University. The Tigers then beat Louisiana Tech the following weekend and became the #1 team in the nation. The next week the Tigers beat Ole Miss. In his final game at Tiger Stadium, the Tigers lost to Arkansas State University. With this loss, it was not likely the team could win the national title. However, LSU, without Flynn, beat Tennessee for the SEC Championship. This win by LSU and losses by Missouri State University and West Virginia State University let LSU go to the championship game in New Orleans.
On January 7, 2008, Flynn led LSU to a BCS National Championship. They beat Ohio State 38-24. Flynn was named offensive MVP of the game.
Flynn was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the 7th round (209th overall) of the 2008 NFL Draft. On July 23, he was signed to a four-year contract through the 2011 season. He is now Green Bay's second-string quarterback. He won the back-up role to Aaron Rodgers by beating out fellow rookie and second-round pick Brian Brohm. The battle for the second-string position became the most interesting battle in camp. Flynn was seen as being less talented than Brohm because of Brohm's larger size, and better arm and foot speed.
On December 19, 2010, Flynn made his first NFL start against the New England Patriots because starting quarterback Aaron Rodgers was hurt. Flynn threw three touchdown passes. He threw one each to John Kuhn, James Jones and Greg Jennings against New England. He also threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown by Kyle Arrington. The Packers lost the game 31-27. Flynn completed 23 of 37 passes for 254 yards in the loss, and was praised for his good work
On January 1, 2012, the Packers were the #1 seed and rested most of their starting players., Matt Flynn started the final game of the season against the Detroit Lions.

Defensive tackle

A defensive tackle is a position in the center of the defensive line in American and Canadian football. These are some of the largest players (in size) on the field. Their main jobs are to occupy offensive linemen, tackle, and make it hard for the quarterback to throw the ball. They rarely do anything else. In the National Football League, defensive tackles may wear numbers in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 90s, but may wear any number they chose in college football.

Coffin Bay National Park is a large national park on the west coast of the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. It is west of Port Lincoln. The park protects a range of different coastal areas including high cliffs, surf beaches, quiet bays and huge sand dunes. A large area of the park is on the Coffin Bay Peninsula. Much of the park is only accessible by four-wheel drive vehicles or boat.
Aboriginal stories say a great fire came from the ocean. Two men stopped the fire by dumping the sand dunes on top of it.
One of the trees found in the park is the Drooping Sheoak, Allocasuarina verticillata, and it is being replanted to restore some of the grassy woodlands. Western Grey Kangaroos, lizards and emus can be found through the park.

Way Down East

Way Down East is a 1920 silent movie. It was directed by D. W. Griffith. The movie stars Lillian Gish as Anna and Richard Barthelmess as David. The movie is based on a 19th century play by Lottie Blair Parker. 
This movie is famous for its exciting climax. Lillian Gish's character is rescued from certain death on an icy river. "Way Down East" is the fourth highest grossing silent movie in movie history. It brought in more than $4,500,000 at the box office in 1920. Some parts of "Way Down East" were shot in an early Technicolor process.
Anna Moore is tricked into a fake marriage by the rich Lennox Sanderson. She gets pregnant, and he leaves her. She has the baby on her own. The baby dies. Anna wanders until she gets a job with Squire Bartlett. His son David falls in love with her. She rejects him because of her past. 
Squire Bartlett learns of Anna's past. He throws her out into a blizzard. Anna becomes lost in the storm. David leads a search party. Anna floats down an icy river towards a steep waterfall. She is rescued by David. He marries her in the final scene. 
Some modern critics like the movie, some do not. Paul Brenner has written, "Many of Griffith's features suffer from sententious moralizing, a sense of God speaking to the masses, and outright racism. But "Way Down East" highlights the greatness of Griffith without having to sit through the Sermon on the Mount or the Ride of The Klan. In "Way Down East", Griffith's psychotic nuttiness, for once, didn't get in the way of a good [movie]."
Critic Dennis Schwartz likes "the strong emotional performances of the diminutive Lillian Gish". He decides that "this old-fashioned bucolic soap opera doesn't translate well to modern-times. It's quintessential Griffith melodrama, a mix of opposing forces between those favoring Bible morality and the wealthy hedonists who mock God with their amorality ... [the movie] has an irritating moralistic Bible flavor in supporting monogamy ... The [movie]'s most exciting scene was made without any special effects, and is the only thing about the [movie] worth remembering."

Fracture (geology)

In geology, a fracture is any kind of separation or break in a rock formation. Examples are joints or faults. These divides the rock into two or more pieces. A fracture can sometimes form a deep, wide crack in the rock. They are usually caused when the rock is not strong enough to hold up under too much stress. This makes the rock crack along its weakest point. Fractures can provide access for fluids, like water or hydrocarbons, to move into the rock.

<doc id="332005" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=332005" title="Joint (geology)">
Joint (geology)

In geology, a joint is a fracture dividing rock into two sections that have not moved away from each other. A joint sees little or no displacement. In other kinds of fracturing, like in a fault, the rock is parted by a visible crack that forms a gap in the rock.
Joints push out in various directions, usually vertically. They can have smooth, clean surfaces, or they can be scarred from sliding against another joint. Joints usually occur as sets, with each set made up of joints that are parallel to each other.
Joints become more and more obvious when the rock is weathered (eroded by the elements). When water gets into the joints, this can lead to the formation of big caves and underground rivers.

Swashbuckler movie

Swashbuckler movies are movies about rough, manly swordsmen. A swashbuckling hero has high ideals. He rescues damsels in distress. His enemy is usually a dastardly villain. Swashbucklers who combine outstanding courage, swordfighting skill, resourcefulness, chivalry, and a distinctive sense of honor and justice include The Three Musketeers, The Scarlet Pimpernel, Robin Hood, and Zorro. 
Swashbuckler movies are one of the most flamboyant Hollywood genres. These movies are unrealistic. They are often set in the Renaissance, in Arabia, or on pirate ships. Sets are elaborate. Costumes are lavish. Swashbuckler movies attract big audiences. These audiences want to forget their boring everyday lives. They can escape their lives in the adventure, romance, and daring stunts of the swashbuckler movie. Famous actors who portrayed swashbucklers are Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks.
The stories came from romantic costume novels like those written by Alexandre Dumas, père and Rafael Sabatini. Last but not least, thrilling music was an important part of the movie formula. There were three great cycles of swashbuckler films: the Douglas Fairbanks period of 1920-1929, the Errol Flynn period of 1935-1941, and a period in the 1950s that included movies such as "Ivanhoe". The British television series "The Adventures of Robin Hood" made the genre even more popular. The genre has been revived in the "Pirates of the Caribbean" series of movies.

William Haines

Charles William "Billy" Haines (January 2, 1900 – December 26, 1973) was an American movie actor and interior designer. He was a popular star of the silent movie era. In 1933, MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer fired the gay actor because he did not want to enter into a marriage of convenience. Haines never returned to movies. Instead, he started a successful interior design business with his lifelong male partner Jimmie Shields. 
Haines was born Charles William Haines on January 2, 1900 in Staunton, Virginia. He sang in the choir of Trinity Episcopal Church. He spent much time in the local movie theater. Haines ran away from home at 14 with his boyfriend. They opened a dance hall in Hopewell, Virginia. The Haines family found their son. He returned home to help support his sick father. He found his way to New York City. He joined the gay community in Greenwich Village. He did some modelling. He was discovered by a talent scout who sent him to Hollywood.
Haines played bit parts in silent movies. His first good role was in "Three Wise Fools" in 1923. The critics liked him. MGM began promoting him as a future star. He generally played arrogant young men who are humbled at the end of the movie. 
He took a trip to New York in 1926. He met James "Jimmie" Shields, probably as a pick-up on the street. Haines convinced Shields to move to Los Angeles. He promised to get Shields work as an extra. The two were soon living together. They viewed themselves as a committed couple.
In 1933 he was arrested in a YMCA with a sailor he had picked up in Los Angeles. MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer told Haines to choose between a marriage with a woman or Jimmie Shields. Haines chose Shields. They stayed together for almost 50 years. Mayer fired Haines and ended his contract. 
Haines had many movie hits. He was a top-five box office star from 1928 to 1932. A 1930 survey of film exhibitors listed Haines as the top box office attraction in the country. "The Marines are Coming" was his last movie. It was made in a Poverty Row studio in 1934. Haines was blacklisted in Hollywood for moral corruption.
Haines and Shields began careers as interior designers and antique dealers. Hollywood celebrities went to their businesses. In 1936, neighbors accused the two men of seeking sex with their son. Members of the Ku Klux Klan dragged Haines and Shields from their home. They were beaten. Their close friends wanted them to prosecute. They declined. Haines served in World War II. The couple settled into the Hollywood community in Brentwood. Their business made money and they retired in the early 1970s. 
Haines and Shields remained together for the rest of their lives. Joan Crawford described them as "the happiest married couple in Hollywood." Haines died from lung cancer in Santa Monica, California at the age of 73. Soon afterward, Shields, who suffered from what many believe to have been Alzheimer's disease, put on Haines' pajamas, took an overdose of pills, and crawled into their bed to die. They were buried side by side in Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery.
William Haines Designs is still in operation. Its main offices are in West Hollywood with showrooms in New York, Denver, and Dallas. Haines's life story is told in the 1998 biography "Wisecracker: The Life and Times of William Haines, Hollywood's First Openly Gay Star" by William J. Mann. Haines's designs are the subject of Peter Schifando and Haines associate Jean H. Mathison's 2005 book "Class Act: William Haines Legendary Hollywood Decorator". World of Wonder produced "Out of the Closet, Off the Screen: The Life of William Haines" It aired on HBO in 2001. Haines has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7012 Hollywood Boulevard.

Monomer

A monomer is a single atom or molecule which is able to join with other monomers to make new substances called polymers. The words come from the Greek language where "mono" means "one", "poly" means "many", and "meros" means "a part". A feature of monomers is that they have two carbon atoms which are joined, called a carbon double bond. The double bond allows the monomer to make the long chains of polymers. There are thousands of different monomers. Examples of monomers include monosaccharide which is simple sugar, glycerol, amino acid and nucleotide. The most made monomer is ethylene

Batik

Evidence of early examples of batik has been found in the Far East, Middle East, Central Asia and India from over 2000 years ago. However, it is more likely that the craft spread from Asia to the islands of the Malay Archipelago and west to the Middle East through the caravan route. They are decorated with trees, animals, flute players, hunting scenes, and mountains. Indonesia, most popular on the island of Java, is the area where batik has reached the greatest accomplishment.There are many examples of this form of batik, as well as hand-produced work in many parts of the world today.
Batik is an art that is becoming more popular in the West. In Indonesia, batik is a part of an ancient tradition and has been taught for centuries. The word batik is from Java and it means to "dot". To make a batik, an artist uses the cloth as the paper, and they just start drawing hot wax over the cloth. Each culture has different traditional styles of batik. The history of batik is really expressive. There are a lot of techniques available for the artist to have the opportunity to explore a unique process in an exciting way.
To make a batik, they use the cloth as the paper, and they just start drawing hot wax over the cloth. And they said if we repeated the process, it will be more colorful. For the first step, make sure the cloth is washed. Batik patterns are drawn with pencil and later drawn again using a hot wax. The very common thing that people use is the pen-like instrument called a tjanting. After the cloth is dry, the areas keep their original color, and it also shows the pattern between the areas that have the color and do not have the color. It gives them a pattern. Then the artist repeats the process once for each color. A very traditional type of batik, called written batik, is drawn using only a tjanting. The cloth needs to be drawn on both sides and put in a color bath three or four times. The process may take up to a year.

Payment protection insurance

Payment protection insurance (commonly abbreviated PPI) is a special insurance. People who get a loan can get an insurance against dying, having an accident or becoming unemployed during the runtime of this loan. If the person taking the loan dies, the rest of the loan is paid by the insurance company; if they become unable to work because of an accident, or because of unemployment, the insurance company will pay the installments. 
This form of insurance has often been criticised because it is expensive; also the insurance and the people selling the insurance usually have high margins on these kinds of insurance.

Peplum movie

Peplum movie (sometimes, sword and sandal movie) is a movie genre. Peplum movies have an ancient Greek, Roman, or Biblical setting. "Peplum" refers to a garment worn by the ancient Greeks and Romans.
The central character in a peplum movie is usually a muscular hero like Hercules or Samson. He wears a short peplum and battles monsters, despots, and evil queens. This oil-slicked, nearly-nude hero is rewarded at the end of the movie with the cheers of his people, clan, or tribe and the hand of a lovely princess.
Peplum movies were mostly made in Italy. Italian moviemakers modelled peplum movies on the big budget Hollywood epics like "Spartacus". The genre was very important in Italian moviemaking from 1957 to 1965, but was shoved aside in 1965 by the "Spaghetti Western".
Critics thought peplum movies were pretty poor stuff. They treated them with snooty contempt. Italian director Vittorio Cottafavi called the genre "Neo-Mythology". Charlton Heston's "Ben-Hur" (1959) and Elizabeth Taylor's "Cleopatra" (1963) are generally considered big-budget sword and sandal movies that mark the end of the genre.

Muscular Christianity

Muscular Christianity is a term for a movement originating during the Victorian era. It stressed the need for energetic Christian activism in combination with an ideal of vigorous masculinity. It is most associated with the English writers Charles Kingsley and Thomas Hughes, and in Canada with Ralph Connor, though the name was bestowed by others. Kingsley and Hughes promoted physical strength and health (at least for men) as well as an active pursuit of Christian ideals in personal life and politics.
Muscular Christianity has continued itself through organisations that combine physical and Christian spiritual development. It is influential within both Catholicism and Protestantism.
