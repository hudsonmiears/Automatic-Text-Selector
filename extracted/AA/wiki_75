Delaware Route 82

Delaware Route 82 (DE 82) is a state highway in the northwest suburbs of Wilmington in New Castle County, Delaware. The route runs from DE 52 near Greenville to the Pennsylvania border near Yorklyn. There it continues as Pennsylvania Route 82 (PA 82). The route passes through areas of trees and fields in the north part of New Castle County. A lot of the route passes next to the Red Clay Creek. All of the route is a part of the Red Clay Valley Scenic Byway, made in 2005. DE 82 was first given its number by 1952. It was signed onto the same road it is on today. In 2010, DelDOT had planned to remove the route number. But it did not happen because people did not want the route number to be removed.
DE 82 heads to the west of DE 52 near Greenville as Campbell Road. The road has two lanes cars can travel on without a median, which is a physical divider between the travel lanes in each direction. East of DE 52, the road continues to DE 100 as Kirk Road. The road passes areas of homes with trees and fields. Then it crosses over the Hoopes Reservoir. Not far after the reservoir, DE 82 makes a left turn onto New London Road to go south. The route passes through large areas of trees, turning to the west as it makes many turns. The road goes near more fields and homes in a rural area before coming to an intersection with Mt. Cuba Road. Here, DE 82 goes northwest on Creek Road and passes next to the Red Clay Creek and the Wilmington and Western Railroad on a road with many trees. It makes more turns and goes over the creek two times before crossing the railroad two times. In this area, the route passes the Ashland Nature Center. The route comes to the community of Yorklyn, where the route turns southwest for a short time and passes a few buildings in rural areas. After making a turn to the northwest to go on Creek Road, DE 82 heads north next to the Red Clay Creek. The Wilmington and Western Railroad turns to the southwest away from the road. A short distance past Yorklyn, the route comes to the Pennsylvania border, where it becomes PA 82 and goes toward Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. All of DE 82 is a part of the Red Clay Valley Scenic Byway, a scenic byway (road) name given to many roads in the Red Clay Creek valley.
When Delaware started giving numbers to state highways in the 1930s, the road that is DE 82 today did not have a number. By 1952, DE 82 was made on the road it follows today to go between PA 82 to DE 52 near Greenville. DE 82 became part of the Red Clay Valley Scenic Byway, the second scenic byway in Delaware, in 2005. In 2010, DelDOT planned to remove the DE 82 signs in order to keep the route as a scenic byway. After a public workshop on the proposed sign removal was held, DelDOT decided in April 2010 to keep the DE 82 signs because 
people in the area did not like the plan to remove the signs.
The entire route is in New Castle County.

List of numbered routes in Delaware

The following is a List of numbered routes in Delaware, made up of Interstate highways, U.S. routes, and state routes. The Delaware Department of Transportation is responsible for taking care of the numbered roads in Delaware. State routes in Delaware use a highway sign that has the numbers in a white circle on a black square. Delaware's numbering system is like that of the U.S. Highways in that odd numbered highways (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9) travel north-south and even numbered routes (2, 4, 6, 8, or 0) go east-west. The numbers get bigger as one goes south and west respectively. There are some numbers that do not follow this, however, mostly with routes from other states keeping their number as they enter Delaware.
The first numbered routes in Delaware came in 1925 with the creation of the U.S. Highway System, in which US 13, US 40, and US 113 were made by law to run through the state. In 1930 and again in 1932, the Delaware State Highway Department suggested giving numbers to state roads to go along with the existing U.S. Highway System. By 1936, Delaware began giving numbers to state routes. In 1956, the Interstate Highway System was made, with under 40 miles of Interstate highway made by law in New Castle County.

Nasi kucing

Nasi kucing (also called sego kucing), meaning cat rice or cat's rice, is an Indonesian rice dish. It comes from Yogyakarta, Semarang, and Surakarta. It can now be found in many places. It is a small serving of rice with different toppings. Often the toppings include chili sauce, dried fish, and tempeh. It is wrapped in banana leaves. 
The name "nasi kucing", which means "cat rice" or "cat's rice", comes from the size of the rice served. There is very little rice, almost like what a Javanese person would give to a cat.
"Nasi kucing" was first served in Yogyakarta, Semarang, and Surakarta. Now it can be found in many places. It can be found in Jakarta and even Mecca; in Mecca it is sold by Indonesian workers during the hajj.
The rice part of "nasi kucing" is small, about as big as a fist. It is served with different toppings. The toppings often include "sambal" (chili sauce), dried fish, and tempeh. Sometimes the toppings can be egg, chicken, and cucumber. It is able to be eaten immediately after it is bought. It is served wrapped in a banana leaf and paper. 
Another version of "nasi kucing", called "sego macan" (meaning "tiger's rice") is three times the size of a regular portion of "nasi kucing". "Sego macan" is served with roasted rice, dried fish, and vegetables. Like "nasi kucing", "sego macan" is served wrapped in a banana leaf and paper.
"Nasi kucing" is often sold at a low price. Sometimes "nasi kucing" can be as cheap as Rp 1000 (US$ 0.12). "Sego macan" can be about Rp 4000 (US$ 0.48). It is often sold at small food stalls called "angkringan", which are located at the side of many roads. The customers are often poorer people, including pedicab and taxi drivers, students, and street musicians. This has led to "angkringan" being called the "lowest class of eatery".
The owners of the "angkringan" often come from poorer families, may have few skills that can be used to find a job, or come from far-away villages. To open their stalls, they borrow money from a patron, called a "juragan". They may borrow up to Rp 900,000.00 (US$ 105.00). The seller must repay the patron from the net profits of Rp 15,000.00 – Rp 20,000.00 (US$ 1.75 – 2.35) a day.

Hyponatremia

Hyponatremia (British English: hyponatraemia) is when a human body does not have enough salt (sodium) in its blood. It is mostly caused by the presence of too much water.
Hyponatremia is most often a complication of other medical illnesses in which excess water collects in the body faster than can be excreted (for example in congestive heart failure, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), or polydipsia). Some runners who drink a lot of water before running a marathon also suffer this illness. Drinking too much water can impair the ability of marathon runners.

Pufferfish

The pufferfish is a family of fish, with about 100 species. They are also known as the blowfish, fugu, swellfish, and globefish. They are called the pufferfish because when they are threatened, they puffs up to about twice their normal size by gulping water. In this enlarged state, the pufferfish can swim at only about half their normal speed. Pufferfish are generally believed to be the second-most poisonous vertebrates in the world, after the golden poison frog. They use tetrodotoxin, a powerful neurotoxin.
Most pufferfish are found in sub-tropical and tropical marine waters (including coral reefs) in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Some puffers live in brackish and fresh water. 
The scientific name refers to the four large teeth, fused into an upper and lower plate, which are used for crushing the shells of crustaceans and mollusks, their natural prey.
Despite their poison, the meat of some species is eaten in Japan (as 河豚, pronounced 'fugu'), Korea (as 복 bok or 복어 bogeo ), and China (as 河豚 hétún). It is prepared by specially trained chefs who know which part is safe to eat and in what quantity.

Oxytocin

Oxytocin is a hormone found in mammals. It acts on the brain. In humans it is released during female reproduction, especially during and after childbirth. 
It has other effects. It encourages pair bonding, and parental behaviour. It is released during intimate moments during orgasms and even hugs. For this reason it is often called the 'love hormone'.
Strange to say, the oxytocin released by the pituitary gland cannot reach the brain: it does have effects on the rest of the body. The reason is that there is a bloodbrain barrier which prevents large molecules from getting into the brain. Instead, the hormone is produced by special nerve cells inside the brain. 
Oxytocin is also released through the use of recreational drugs like MDMA and some prescription anti-depressants.
Oxytocin was the first polypeptide hormone to be sequenced and synthesized, by Vincent du Vigneaud and colleagues in 1953.

Ocean sunfish

The Ocean sunfish ("Mola mola", also called the mola or sun fish) is a large ocean fish found in warm and temperate oceans. It has an almost circular, flattened body. This unusual fish swims by flapping its long pectoral and dorsal fins; the caudal fin is used as a rudder (for steering). Some sunfish have been seen floating on their sides at the top of the sea; they may be using the sun to heat themselves up. They eat crustaceans, starfish, jellyfish, sponges, mollusks, algae, plankton, squid, and small fish.
The species is native to tropical and temperate waters around the globe. It resembles a fish head with a tail, and its main body is flattened laterally.

<doc id="304750" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=304750" title="Pyramid scheme">
Pyramid scheme

A pyramid scheme is a way of making money that cannot continue very long. It involves promising people payment, services or ideals, primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme or training them to take part. It does not supply any real investment or sale of products or services to the public. Pyramid schemes are a form of fraud. For this reason, pyramid schemes are illegal in many countries. 
This type of scheme has existed for at least a century (100 years). The way the scheme is described is sometimes changed to hide what it is doing. Many people believe that multilevel marketing (MLM) is also a pyramid scheme.
A successful pyramid scheme combines a business that seems real with a simple-to-understand money-making description which is used for profit. The idea is that the first person, Mr. X, makes a payment. To get money, Mr. X has to recruit others like him who will also make a payment. Mr. X gets paid out of money received from those new people (recruits). The recruits go on to involve others. As each new recruit makes a payment, Mr. X gets a part. He is promised always increasing benefits as the "business" expands.
Such "businesses" do not have real products or services. To make them more believable, most such scams have fake letters from successful members and information. Only the first person (sometimes called the "pharaoh") and a very few at the top levels of the pyramid make a lot of money. The amounts get much smaller further down the pyramid. Someone at the bottom of the pyramid loses money. They paid to enter, but cannot get anyone else to join.
Recruiting a large number of others into a scheme can be difficult so a system is used that seems more simple. In this model each person must recruit only two others. However, a larger number of levels is needed before the person gets paid any money. The scheme requires a person to recruit two others, who must each recruit two others, who must each recruit two others. 
The "eight-ball" model contains a total of fifteen members. This scheme has been called the "Airplane Game" and the four tiers labelled as "captain," "co-pilot," "crew," and "passenger" to denote a person's level. 
Such schemes may hide their pyramid nature by calling themselves as "gifting circles" with money being "gifted." The eight passengers must each pay (or "gift") a sum (e.g. $1,000) to join the scheme. This total of $8,000 goes to the captain who leaves the scheme. Everyone remaining moves up one level. There are now two new captains so the group splits in two with each group requiring eight new passengers. A person who joins the scheme as a passenger will not get any money until they advance through the crew and co-pilot levels to captain. Therefore, the participants in the bottom 3 tiers of the pyramid lose their money if the scheme collapses. Popular schemes such as the "Women Empowering Women" do this.

BMW in Formula One

BMW has been in Formula One since the beginning of the World Drivers' Championship in . BMW entered several races in the 1950s and 1960s. Often, they ran using the Formula Two rules. In the 1980s, they built the BMW M12/13 inline-four turbocharged engine. This engine was built for the Brabham team. Nelson Piquet won the championship driving a Brabham-BMW. BMW also supplied the M12/13 engine to the ATS, Arrows, Benetton and Ligier teams. In , Brabham left F1 for the season, and BMW stopped its official backing of the engines. Arrows still used the engine with the Megatron name. When Formula One banned turbocharged engines in , the M12/13 could no longer be used.
BMW returned to Formula One in . They made a deal to supply engines to only the Williams team. The engine was a new V10 engine. The engine deal with Williams ended after the season. BMW then bought the rival Sauber team. The BMW Sauber project lasted from until . Sauber, a former privateer team, became more competitive. In , Robert Kubica won the team's only race, the Canadian Grand Prix, with Nick Heidfeld finishing second. After the 2009 season, BMW withdrew from F1. They sold the team back to its founder, Peter Sauber.
The early years of the World Drivers' Championship saw private BMW racing cars, based on the pre-war BMW 328 chassis. They were entered in the German Grands Prix in and . A modified 328 with a rear engine became standard in Formula One in the early 1960s. It was known as the "Heck", the German automotive term for "back" or "rear". This design later found success with the Cooper team.
In German Grand Prix, BMW entered Hubert Hahne in a Lola chassis powered by an larger BMW engine, and David Hobbs in the Lola with the standard smaller BMW engine. For the German Grand Prix, Hahne returned and finished tenth, BMW's best result in Formula One to that date. BMW then entered three of its own 269 F2 chassis for the German Grand Prix for Hahne, Gerhard Mitter and Dieter Quester. Mitter was killed in a practice accident. The remaining BMW team withdrew from the race. BMW left F1 for a number of years.
In , Renault entered Formula One with a turbocharged engine. After the success Renault had, BMW decided to develop its own turbo engine. BMW announced the new program in April 1980. The engine was based on the BMW M10, a four-cylinder, 1.5 litre, normally aspirated (non-turbocharged) engine designed in the late 1950s. The racing version, the M12, had been successful in Formula Two and other series. The prototype 1.4 litre turbo engine soon developed 600 bhp. It used a single Kühnle, Kopp & Kausch (KKK) turbocharger, Bosch electronics, and fuel injection. This engine was developed into the M12/13, the race engine BMW supplied to five teams from 1982 to 1988.
BMW first made a deal to supply the M12/13 engine only to the Brabham. Testing of the M12/13 started in late 1980. A new car, Brabham BT50 was design for the engine. The new car was not finished until will into the season. The team's lead driver, Nelson Piquet, tested the BT50 throughout 1981. The car was unreliable until Bosch improved the electronics.
Brabham began the 1982 season with two BMW-powered BT50 chassis. Because of reliability problems, the BT50 was not used at all the races that year. BMW saw their first win in Canadian Grand Prix, where the cool conditions helped the turbocharged engine. The BT50 was used for the rest of the season. The car was still unreliable, and the drivers only made four finishes the rest of the season.
In , the reliability of the BMW engine was improved. The new Brabham BT52 allowed Nelson Piquet to win the Drivers' Championship. Brabham finished third in the Constructors' Championship. BMW also began supplying its engines to the German ATS team this season. Manfred Winkelhock, the only driver for the team, was unable to score any points.
For , BMW expanded to three teams, supplying the M12/13 to Arrows. In , BMW was back to two teams. ATS had left Formula One. Piquet won one race, the French Grand Prix. It was the only win for BMW that year.
For the 1986 season, BMW was back to three teams with the addition of Benetton. Benetton had the most success, scoring 19 points, and winning the Mexican Grand Prix. In , BMW only supplied Brabham with works engines. Arrows and Ligier used the "Megatron", a rebadged BMW engine. At the end of the year, Benetton team owner Bernie Ecclestone decided not to compete the following year. This ended the BMW turbo engine. The Arrows team still used the "Megatrons" engine for . They finished fifth in the Constructors' Championship, their best finish in the team's 25-year history.
For , the technical regulations were changed to ban turbocharged engines. During the M12/13 engine's time in F1, the engine had won the 1983 Drivers' Championship and nine Grands Prix. It also took 14 pole positions and set 13 fastest laps.
Williams had been very successful using Renault engines. They won the , , and Drivers' Championships. They also won the , , , and Constructors' Championships. When Renault left F1 at the end of 1997, Williams needed a new engine. In , the BMW signed a contract to supply the Williams team with engines.
BMW spent 18 months building and testing a normally aspirated, 3.0 litre V10 engine. The E41 engine was ready to race in the 2000 season. The Williams FW22 with the BMW E41 engine was driven by Ralf Schumacher and Jenson Button. Schumacher scored a podium finish in the engine's first race. The team finished the year with two more podium finishes, and third in the Constructors' Championship.
For , BMW designed a more aggressive P80 engine. The engine had a big power improvement. Schumacher and new team-mate Juan Pablo Montoya scored four race wins. For , the team won only one race with Schumacher at the Malaysian Grand Prix. Montoya took seven pole positions, but was not able to win a single race.
The Williams team was more competitive in . Both drivers won on two time. For , Williams produced the FW26 chassis with a radical nose section. This design did not work very well. Williams slipped to fourth in the Constructors' Championship. Montoya's victory in the Brazilian Grand Prix the team's only win (and the team's final win to date). Both Schumacher and Montoya left the team at the end of the season.
BMW bought Swiss team Sauber in June 2005 to form the BMW Sauber F1 Team. The takeover came after BMW's relationship with Williams had deteriorated in the previous months, the partnership ending at the end of the season. The team was based at Sauber's headquarters in Hinwil, Switzerland and BMW's headquarters in Munich, Germany.
The team scored two podium finishes and came fifth in 2006, its first season in Formula One. This was followed by a second place in 2007 after the McLaren team had been excluded from the championship. Polish driver Robert Kubica took the team's only Grand Prix victory at the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix. Following a poor season, BMW withdrew from Formula One and sold the team back to founder Peter Sauber.
For the 2006 season, BMW Sauber signed Nick Heidfeld from Williams to be the lead driver, while World Champion Jacques Villeneuve had his existing two-year contract with Sauber honoured. Robert Kubica was signed as the team's third driver. The team continued to use Sauber's facilities, mostly for chassis construction and wind tunnel testing, while BMW's headquarters in Munich were responsible for building the new 2.4 litre P86 V8 engine, revised technical regulations forcing a change from the 3 litre V10 formula. This replaced the Petronas-badged Ferrari engines which the team had used since 1997. The Sauber team's existing major sponsors, Petronas and Credit Suisse, renewed their contracts with BMW. The team also announced a technical partnership with technology company Intel. The team's new livery, which was maintained throughout its tenure in Formula One, consisted of the traditional BMW blue and white with a hint of red.
Villeneuve scored the team's first points with a seventh-place finish at the Malaysian Grand Prix, after Heidfeld retired from fifth with an engine failure late in the race. Over the first two thirds of the season the drivers picked up points with a succession of seventh and eighth-place finishes, plus a fourth-place finish for Heidfeld at the Australian Grand Prix. The team ran a radical "twin towers" aero enhancement on the front of the car for the French Grand Prix, which was meant improve the flow of air over the top of the chassis. The parts were promptly banned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) as they were adjudged to impede the drivers' vision and thus compromise safety.
Heidfeld scored the team's first podium finish at the Hungarian Grand Prix from tenth on the grid. This race also saw the début of Robert Kubica, who replaced Villeneuve after the latter had crashed heavily at the preceding German Grand Prix. Kubica finished seventh, although he was later disqualified after his car was found to be underweight. The official reason for Villeneuve's absence was that he was recovering from his previous accident, but the team later announced that the driver change was permanent. Kubica scored BMW Sauber's second podium finish of the season at the Italian Grand Prix, after running in third place for most of the race and leading briefly during the first round of pit stops. Heidfeld finished in eighth, but set the team's first fastest lap. The team scored a total of 36 points to finish fifth in the Constructors' Championship, an improvement on Sauber's eighth position with 20 points in .
On 19 October 2006, BMW announced that Robert Kubica would partner Nick Heidfeld for the 2007 Formula One season with Sebastian Vettel taking the test and reserve driver role. Timo Glock was later signed as the team's second test driver. The team launched its 2007 car, the F1.07, on January 16, 2007.
The new car showed promising form throughout winter testing, topping the times sheets on occasions. However, team principal Mario Theissen declared some reliability concerns before the season's opening race in Australia. Kubica retired from fourth place with a gearbox problem, but Heidfeld took over the position and held it to the end of the race. In the early races of the season, Heidfeld and Kubica scored a series of points finishes and established BMW Sauber as the third-fastest team, behind Ferrari and McLaren. Theissen also made the point that the performance gap between BMW Sauber and the two top teams was less than the gap between BMW Sauber and the teams behind it.
The Canadian Grand Prix brought mixed fortunes for the team. While Heidfeld scored BMW Sauber's best result thus far with a second-place finish, Kubica suffered a huge crash that resulted in a long safety car period. The media was initially told Kubica had broken his leg, but it later proved that he had escaped with only a sprained ankle and concussion. Vettel took his place in the United States Grand Prix, finishing in eighth place and therefore becoming the youngest driver to score a Formula One World Championship point. Later in the season, Vettel moved teams to take a race seat at the Toro Rosso team.
Kubica returned to racing action at the French Grand Prix and proved his recovery by finishing in fourth position. Over the remainder of the season, he and Heidfeld continued their form to score a total of 101 points, which secured the team second in the Constructors' Championship after McLaren's disqualification. Heidfeld scored another podium finish at the Hungarian Grand Prix and scored 61 points to Kubica's 39, while Vettel's sole appearance produced an additional point.
On August 21, 2007, BMW confirmed its driver line-up of Heidfeld and Kubica for the season.
Their 2008 car, the F1.08 was officially launched in Munich at BMW Welt on January 14, 2008. It made its track debut at Valencia the next day, with Robert Kubica driving. Team principal Mario Theissen set the target of the team's first win.
BMW Sauber started the season well with Kubica narrowly missing out on pole after a mistake in his main qualifying lap in Melbourne. He later retired after being hit by Kazuki Nakajima but Heidfeld finished second. Kubica took second in Malaysia, with Heidfeld in 6th setting the fastest lap of the race. The team's points total of 11 was their largest score up to that time. In Bahrain, Kubica scored his and the team's first ever pole position, beating Felipe Massa by just under three hundredths of a second. The team went on to finish 3rd and 4th in the race, equalling their highest round points total and promoting them to first place in the constructors' championship for the first time.
The team also attained a second-place finish in the Monaco Grand Prix with Robert Kubica, beating both Ferraris and only trailing the McLaren of Lewis Hamilton by three seconds.
BMW Sauber's first race victory came in the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix, the team achieving a one-two finish with Robert Kubica's first race win and Nick Heidfeld taking second place. The victory came after Lewis Hamilton collided with Kimi Räikkönen in the pitlane, ending the race for both drivers. Kubica was on a different refueling strategy from Heidfeld, who also briefly led the race before securing the one-two finish for BMW Sauber in comfortable fashion.
After the team's breakthrough win, development was switched to the 2009 season where new regulations come into play. This greatly annoyed Kubica, (who was leading the championship after the Canadian Grand Prix), as he felt they could have had a realistic chance of taking at least one title. The lack of development was reflected with a drop of form throughout the second half of the season, causing BMW to be outpaced by Renault, Toyota and even Toro Rosso (who started the season as one of the slowest teams) by the end of the season. Despite this, Kubica remained with an outside chance of taking the drivers championship until the Chinese Grand Prix, the 17th round out of 18.
In October the team confirmed that they would stick with Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld as their drivers for the Season.
Although BMW Sauber targeted the season as the year they would challenge for the title, their start to the season was a disappointment. Kubica was running in 3rd place in the opening round when he collided with Vettel while battling for 2nd place and was forced to retire. Heidfeld then secured the team's first podium of the year in Malaysia, but after 6 races BMW Sauber had collected a mere 6 points, and occupied 8th place in the Constructors' Championship out of 10 teams. A raft of upgrades were set for Turkey, including an improved regenerative braking system (KERS) and a double deck diffuser. While the new diffuser was implemented, the KERS could not be made to fit the new car and both drivers raced without the device. After the qualifying session for the British Grand Prix Mario Theissen announced that the team had decided to halt further development KERS; of which BMW had been one of the strongest proponents, and focus instead on improving the car's aerodynamics. This left Ferrari and McLaren as the only remaining users of the KERS system. In the European Grand Prix at Valencia Robert Kubica scored the team's first points since the race in Turkey.
Following a meeting of the BMW board on July 28, the company held at press conference the following morning in which it confirmed the team's withdrawal from Formula One at the end of 2009. Chairman Dr Norbert Reithofer described the decision as a strategic one. The Formula One Teams Association released a statement in response pledging its support to help the team remain in F1.
On 15 September 2009 it was announced that BMW Sauber had secured a buyer, Qadbak Investments Limited which said to represent European and Middle Eastern interests. However Lotus had been given the 13th and final slot in the 2010 Championship. The team were awarded what was termed a 14th entry, which hinges either on another team dropping out or all the other teams agreeing to allow 28 cars to enter the 2010 Championship.
On November 22, Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung revealed that Qadbak's attempt to purchase the team had failed as it did not have the necessary funds. Qadbak turned out to be a shell company with no assets and no investors behind it. On November 27, 2009 it was announced that Peter Sauber would repurchase the team conditional upon the team receiving a FIA entry for the 2010 season. The FIA subsequently granted Sauber an entry on December 3. The team used Ferrari engines in .
The team retained the BMW Sauber name for the season, despite using Ferrari engines.

List of Interstate Highways

Primary Interstate Highways are the major interstate highways of the United States and have a one or two-digit route number. "Even" (2, 4, 6, 8, or 0) route numbers are given to east/west routes, with the smaller numbered routes in the south (I-10) and bigger numbered routes in the north (I-90). Similarly, "odd" (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9) route numbers are given to north/south routes, with the smaller numbered routes in the west (I-5) and the bigger numbered routes in the east (I-95).
There are five sets of numbers that are used more than once throughout the system; the highways whose numbers are used more than once are separated by big distances to avoid confusion. Below, these are made separate from each other by West and East.
Three-digit Interstates are spur or loop Interstates that usually are in big cities and areas outside of cities. The last two digits of a three-digit Interstate are always the number of the route it is related to. If the first digit is "odd" (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9), the Interstate is usually a spur route while if the first digit is "even" (2, 4, 6, 8, or 0), the Interstate is usually a loop route. 
A total of 67 primary Interstates are in the table below, with 43 of them having three-digit routes. The lengths in the table are as of December 31, 2013.
Routes ending in 0 or 5 are marked in green.
Interstate Highways are not only in the 48 states of the United States that border, but there are also Interstates in Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico.
The Interstate Highways in the island of Oahu, Hawaii are signed with the normal Interstate shield, with the letter "H-" added before the number. They are fully controlled-access routes built to the same standards as the Interstate routes in the main part of the United States.
The Federal Highway Administration gives money to four routes in Alaska and three routes in Puerto Rico under the same program as the rest of the Interstate Highway System. However, these routes do not have to meet the same standards as the Interstate routes in the main part of the United States.
Alaska's Interstates do not have signs to mark them, although they all have state highway numbers that are not the same as the Interstate numbers.
Like Alaska, Puerto Rico signs its Interstates as territorial routes, and the numbers are not the same as their official Interstate designations. Many of the territory's routes are freeway-standard toll roads.

Honus Wagner

Johannes Peter "Honus" Wagner (; February 24, 1874 – December 6, 1955 ) was an American Major League Baseball shortstop. He was nicknamed "The Flying Dutchman" because he was German and very fast. He played in the National League from 1897 to 1917. He played for the Louisville Colonels for two years, and then for the Pittsburgh Pirates for 17 years. Wagner won eight batting titles, the most in National League history. He held the league record for slugging percentage six times, and the record for stolen bases five times.
He was inducted (added to) the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936. He was one of the first five members of the hall of fame. He received the second-highest vote total to be added. Ty Cobb is the only person to get more votes. Babe Ruth tied with Wagner for second-highest.
Most historians think that Ty Cobb is the greatest player of the dead-ball era. But some think that Wagner was a better all-around player. Most baseball historians think that Wagner was the greatest shortstop ever. Cobb said that Wagner was "maybe the greatest star ever to take the diamond."
Johannes Wagner was born on February 24, 1874 in the Chartiers neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. (Chartiers is now part of Carnegie, Pennsylvania.) His parents were Peter and Katheryn Wagner. His father was a coal miner and his mother was a housewife. Both of his parents were German immigrants.
Wagner was one of five children. His mother called him Hans as a child. This name evolved (change into over time) into Honus. When he was 12, Wagner dropped out of school to work in the coal mines with his father. In their free time, Honus and his brothers played sandlot baseball. They became so good that three of Honus's brothers also became professional baseball players.
Honus's older brother, Albert "Butts" Wagner, was a professional baseball player. In 1895, he was playing for the Inter-State League. He got Honus a tryout with the league. 
In 1894, Honus married Bessie Baine Smith. They had three daughters: Elva Katrina (b. 1918), Betty Baine (b. 1919), and Virginia Mae (b. 1922).
Honus started playing for the Inter-State League in 1895. He played for five different teams in his first year. The towns he played for were Steubenville, Akron, Mansfield, Adrian, and Warren.
Ed Barrow, a manager from the Atlantic League, saw Honus play. He convinced Honus to come play for the Paterson Silk Weavers of Paterson, New Jersey. In 1896, Wagner had a batting average of .313. In 1897, Wagner played 74 games and hit .375.

The city's history is complicated.The Port of Klaipėda is important in the area. It is a usually ice-free port on the Baltic Sea. It has been controlled by the Teutonic Knights, the Duchy of Prussia, the Kingdom of Prussia, the German Empire, the Entente States, Lithuania, and the Third Reich. The city became part of Lithuania while it was a Soviet Socialist Republic. Klaipėda remained part of Lithuania after it again became independent state.
The population shrank from 207,100 in 1992 to 177,823 in 2011. Popular seaside resorts found close to Klaipėda are Nida to the south on the Curonian Spit, and Palanga to the north.

JIT

JIT, Just-In-Time compilation is a way to translate bytecode instructions to instructions the processor understands. Bytecode is a set of computer instructions for a processor that only exists on paper. 
The alternative to a JIT is an interpreter that looks at each bytecode instruction individually and then decides what to with it. When you run over the same part of the program again, an interpreter has to make the decisions again. While a JIT makes the decisions on how to handle the bytecode once, and then stores it as native processor instructions (this takes memory). Properly deciding how to translate bytecode take some time, so you have some minor slowdown in startup speed. A proper modern JIT first runs a regular interpreter, and then does the JIT step once it knows something is used frequently.

Avro 683 Lancaster

Avro 683 Lancaster was developed out of Avro 679 Manchester. It was the most used RAF bomber in the Second World War. The changes made on Avro 679, like four Rolls-Royce Merlin X instead of two powerplants and longer wings, have led to the new name Avro 683. Royal Air Force ordered 1070 pieces of this airplane. After the success on the war places, Avro sold the production licence to other companies. One of those was Packard, who bought the licence for powerplant production and improved them. The variant with the most produced pieces was Avro 683 B I, a plane which was the base of RAF Bomber Command at that time.

Indre (department)

Indre is a department in the centre of France in the Centre-Val de Loire region. It is named after the Indre river, the most important river in the department.
Its prefecture is Châteauroux.
The department is one of the 83 French departments made during the French revolution, on 4 March 1790. The department was created from part of the former province of Berry.
The new department had six districts: Issoudun, Châteauroux, Argenton, Le Blanc, La Châtre and Marennes. The capital (now prefecture) was Châteauroux.
In 1800, with the creation of the "arrondissements" in France, the six districts were changed into four "arrondissements": Saintes, Châteauroux, Le Blanc, La Châtre and Issoudun.
On 10 September 1926, the "arrondissement" of Issoudun was eliminated but in 1942 it was made again an "arrondissement".
Indre is part of the Centre-Val de Loire region. It has an area of .
The highest point of the department is "Terrior Randoin" (), in the "commune" of Pouligny-Notre-Dame, and that is above sea level. that is high.
The department is bordered by the departments: Loir-et-Cher, Cher, Creuse, Vienne, Haute-Vienne and Indre-et-Loire.
The main rivers are:
The department is managed by the "General Council of the Indre" in Châteauroux. Indre is part of the region of Centre-Val de Loire.
There are 4 "arrondissements" (districts), 13 "cantons" and 243 "communes" (municipalities) in Indre.
The following is a list of the 13 cantons of the Indre department, following the French canton reorganisation which came into effect in March 2015:
The inhabitants of Indre are known, in French, as "Indriens" (women: "Indriennes").
Indre has a population, in 2013, of 228,091, for a population density of inhabitants/km. The "arrondissement" of Châteauroux, with 127,499 inhabitants, is by far the largest. The other three, Issoudun, La Châtre and Le Blanc, have respectively 35,252, 33,172 and 32,168 inhabitants.
The city with more people living in it is Châteauroux (45,209).

Dragan Klaric

Dragan Klaric, born 1965, is a Swedish blogger and former Sweden Democrats (SD) politician of Croatian origin. He was the head of “SD-television”, the Sweden Democrats’ own TV station, and a full-time party employee. He left the party in temper, motivating his resignation by writing, “the reason [for my resignation] is that I was ‘assfucked’ a mere month before the election as I was requested to resign from my chair at SD-television. Two years and eight months of faithful and loyal service to the party is suddenly forgotten”.
Klaric has been found guilty of libel three times, in tort cases, and has been forced to pay damages in every case. In 2009, the Helsingborg district court found him guilty of libel against Tommy Funebo, and once more in 2010, against Fredrik Jönsson. However, he was not found guilty of the comments somebody wrote about Jönsson on Klaric's blog, which Klaric approved. The court of appeal of Skåne and Blekinge later overruled the district court, finding him guilty.
Klaric’s blog was investigated by the Swedish anti-racist newspaper Expo during its review of the atmosphere of the Sweden Democrats community on the Internet. On May 20, 2010, press ombudsman Yrsa Stenius stated that Klaric “from a press-ethical point of view was to be considered a public person”.
On January 7, 2011, Swedish newspaper Helsingborgs Dagblad reported that the party and Dragan Klaric will end their cooperation in a legal dispute since they do not agree on Klaric’s time as chair of SD-television. According to SD, the party holds the copyright to all of the material from SD-television, and, in addition, SD demands that Klaric returns all equipment he has taken from the station. Klaric refuses to comply, arguing that SD-television was his own private project, and not a part of his employment, and, thus, that he alone owns the physical as well as intellectual property of the station. The events surrounding his resignation were covered by Expo.
After leaving the party, Klaric has intensively criticized the SD leadership on his blog.

George Medal

The George Medal (GM) is the second highest civil award of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth. It ranks below the George Cross. It is only awarded for non-combat acts of bravery. 
The GM was created on 24 September 1940 by King George VI. At this time, during the height of The Blitz, there was a desire to reward acts of civilian courage. It was decided that the George Cross and the GM would recognise civilian bravery in the face of enemy action and brave deeds more widely.
Announcing the new award, the King said: 
The Warrant for the GM was published in the "London Gazette" on 31 January 1941. The medal is granted in recognition of "acts of great bravery". The GM was originally not issued posthumously, but the warrant was amended in 1977 to allow posthumous awards, several of which have been subsequently made.
The medal is primarily a civilian award, but it may be awarded to military personnel for gallant conduct that is not in the face of the enemy. As the Warrant states:
Bars are awarded to the GM in recognition of the performance of further acts of bravery meriting the award. In undress uniform or on occasions when the medal ribbon alone is worn, a silver rosette is worn on the ribbon to indicate each bar. Recipients are entitled to the postnominal letters GM.
The details of all awards to British and Commonwealth recipients are published in the "London Gazette".

The decoration was awarded during World War I, again in World War II, and in other conflicts. The Croix de guerre was also often awarded to foreign military forces allied to France and Belgium.
The Croix de guerre may be given to a unit or to individuals who for acts of heroism involving combat with enemy forces. The medal is also awarded to those who have been "mentioned in despatches". This means a heroic deed was performed meriting a citation from an individual's headquarters unit. The unit award of the Croix de guerre was issued to military commanders who performed heroic deeds in combat and were subsequently recognized by headquarters.

<doc id="305021" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305021" title="Scallop">
Scallop

A scallop is a marine bivalve mollusc of the family Pectinidae. Scallops live in all the world's oceans. 
This is one of the largest families of living bivalves. There are over 300 living species of scallop. Their main adaptation is the ability to swim by clapping their valves together. In this way they escape from most of their predators.
They have a good reputation as a food source. As bivalves they have two shells. The lower shell is usually white (about 95%). It can also be orange (4%) or Lemon Yellow (1%).
The name "scallop" comes from the Old French "escalope", which means "shell". Their shells can be up to 15 centimetres (6 inches) across.
1. Their ability to swim. However, a few species attach to rocks as adults by a filament. Most species lie on sandy beds, and swim off when touched by a starfish or other predator.
2. They have eyes round the edges of their mantle. Their eyes cannot see shapes, but they can detect changing patterns of light and motion.
3. Semi-circular ridged shape to shells. The shells are similar, and fit closely together.
4. At some stage in their lives, all scallops all have a ridge of tiny teeth near the notch where the byssus comes out in other bivalves. This is called the "ctenolium". Its importance is that only scallops have it, and it can be seen in fossils. So that tells palaeontologists when they have a fossil scallop.
Scallops have a central adductor muscle. This is the same as true oysters (family Ostreidae). The inside of their shell has a scar in the middle. This shows where this muscle attaches to the shell. The adductor muscle of scallops is larger and more developed than the adductor muscle of oysters. This is because they swim. 
Most scallops are filter feeders. They eat plankton. The plankton sometimes has scallop larvae in it. Siphons bring water over a filtering structure. Mucus then traps the food. Next, the cilia on the structure moves the food to the mouth. Then, the scallop digests the food in the stomach and digestive gland. Waste goes through the intestine and exits through the anus.
Some scallops, such as the Atlantic bay scallop "Argopecten irradians" do not live for a long time. Others can live 20 years or more.
One can estimate their age from the annuli, the concentric rings on their shells.
The scallop family is unusual because of the variety in arrangements for sexual reproduction. In some species, a scallop has only one sex. They are either male or female. Other species are hermaphrodites so a single scallop has both male and female reproductive organs at the same time. A few scallops are male when they are young and they become female when they grow older.
Red roe comes from female scallops. White roe comes from males. Scallops release Spermatozoa and ova freely into the water during the mating season. Fertilized ova sink to the bottom. The immature scallop hatches after a few weeks. The larvae drift in the plankton until they go to the bottom again to grow. They may attach by means of byssal threads.
There are many Pectinidae species, living and fossil. True Pectinidae (ones with a "ctenolium") first appeared in the Upper or Middle Triassic over 200 million years ago (mya), and perhaps as early as 240 mya. 
The Pectinidae family had a large number of species in the Mesozoic era, but they almost disappeared at the end of the Cretaceous period. The survivors evolved rapidly during the Tertiary period. There are nearly 7,000 species and subspecies for the fossil and recent Pectinidae. 
The evolution of bivalves that swim is a consequence of the so-called "Mesozoic marine revolution". In the Mesozoic era sea-floor predators evolved various new forms which fed on the abundant shellfish (brachiopods and bivalves). These predators are still abundant today: they are mostly the starfish, the gastropods, and the crabs. 
Each predator has its own methods. Crabs break the shells by force. Some gastropods make holes in the shell and put in a paralysing or relaxing substance; others work on small cracks in the edge of the shell. Once they get their proboscis in, they eat the shellfish.
Starfish are the most common predators. The shells of brachiopods and bivalves are held together by strong muscles. What the starfish does is clamp hold of them on either side with its tube feet, and apply a steady pull. The starfish, with its muscles and hydraulic system, can pull for much longer than any bivalve muscle can withstand. Apparently, ten minutes are usually enough to open the shell a bit. Then the starfish slips its stomach inside the shell. The stomach can get through a slot as narrow as 0.1mm. The starfish then dissolves the mollusc where it lives, absorbing the nutrients.
Consequently, there was a great reproductive advantage for any prey which had even the slightest defence to these predators. Many shellfish developed extra-tough shells. Some burrowed into the sand. Scallops must had had some elementary movement, which developed rapidly under selection. They became extremely common in the Mesozoic. There are some other methods used by a few scallops. "Chlamys hastata" often carry sponges on their shell. It is a kind of mutualism. The sponge makes it difficult for starfish to get their tube feet on, and camouflages "Chlamys hastata" from predators. 
When scallops move off the sand they are open to new predators such as rays, which patrol just above the ocean floor. They may also be picked up by seabirds which open shells by dropping them on rock. Evidently the main advantage lies in getting away from the starfish, which are very numerous on inshore and continental shelf habitats.
Studies have shown the Pectinidae family is monophyletic, developing from a single common ancestor. The direct ancestors of Pectinidae were scallop-like bivalves of the family Entoliidae.
The largest wild scallop fishery is for the Atlantic sea scallop ("Placopecten magellanicus") off northeastern United States and eastern Canada. Most of the rest of the world's production of scallops is from Japan (wild, enhanced, and aquaculture), and China (mostly cultured Atlantic bay scallops). In 2005, China accounted for 80% of the global scallop and pecten catch, according to a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) study.
Scallops are popular in both Eastern and Western cooking. They have two types of meat in one shell. The adductor muscle is white and meaty. The roe, called "coral", is red, orange or white and soft.
In Western cuisine, scallops are often sautéed in butter, or breaded and deep fried. The byssus (also called the beard) is often tough. It is usually discarded or used later on for stock. Sometimes, markets sell scallops already prepared in the shell, with only the adductor muscle. Outside the U.S. the scallop is often sold whole, and people eat the adductor muscle and roe.
In Japanese cuisine, scallops may be served in soup or prepared as sashimi or sushi. In a sushi bar, "hotategai" (帆立貝, 海扇) is the traditional scallop on rice. "Kaibashira" (貝柱) might be scallop, but it can also be the adductor muscle of any kind of shellfish, such as mussels, oysters, or clams.
In Cantonese Chinese cuisine dried scallop is called conpoy (乾瑤柱, 乾貝, 干貝).
The scallop shell is the traditional emblem of James, son of Zebedee. It is popular with pilgrims on the Way of St James to the apostle's shrine at Santiago de Compostela in Spain. 
Throughout antiquity, scallops and other hinged shells have symbolized the feminine principle. Many paintings of Venus, the Roman goddess of love and fertility, included a scallop shell in the painting to identify her. This is clear in Botticelli's classically inspired "The Birth of Venus"
Heraldry included the scallop shell symbol as a badge for people who had made the pilgrimage to Compostela. Later it became a symbol of pilgrimage in general. Winston Churchill's family coat of arms includes scallops. However, symbols in heraldry do not always have the same meaning. Sometimes no family member has been on a pilgrimage but there are still scallops on the coat of arms.
Over 45 communes of France have one or more scallop shells on their coat of arms.
The U.S. state of New York has had the Atlantic bay scallop as its state shell since 1988. In design, "scalloped edges" or "ridges" means a wavy pattern which reminds people of the edge of a scallop's shell. Shell petroleum company has had a logo with a scallop shell on it since 1904.

He also received a scholarship to play college football at the University of Illinois, which he accepted. He later transferred to North Carolina A&T. He was one of Martin Luther King Jr.'s main organizers in Chicago for the Southern Christian Leadership Conferences. After King was shot, Jackson formed several civil rights organizations of his own. Two of these were Operation PUSH and the Rainbow Coalition. Jackson was also active in civil rights movements outside the United States. He also served as a Baptist minister.
Jackson ran for President in 1984 and 1988, coming in second in the 1988 Democratic party. Both times, he ran on a very liberal platform that wanted people of all races to co-operate, as well as more emphasis on education, urban issues and infrastructure. He wanted to be chosen as the Democrat's Vice-Presidential nominee, but Lloyd Bentsen was chosen instead. From 1991 to 1997 he was a senator from the District of Columbia, even though the District of Columbia is not a state. People thought Jackson might run against Bill Clinton in the 1996 primaries, but he did not. He is known for saying many things that are controversial. Some things he said were offensive to Jews. He also said that Barack Obama was not black enough.
Jackson's eldest son, Jesse Jackson, Jr., is a former congressman from Illinois.

Structured program theorem

The structured program theorem is a theory in programming and computer science. A computer program can be split into pieces of code that do a certain task. According to the structured program theory, these smaller tasks can be combined in only three ways to get any larger task done.
A program gets a large task done by splitting it into many smaller tasks that the computer can do easily. These smaller tasks are called "subprograms" in computer science. According to the structured program theorem, the three ways subprograms can be combined are:
The theorem was first published in 1966 by Corrado Böhm and Guiseppe Jacopini. It comes from the 1946 description of the von Neumann architecture and the normal form theorem developed by Stephen Kleene.

Lower Triassic

The Lower Triassic is the first of three epochs of the Triassic period. It lasted from about 252.2 million years ago (mya) to ~247.2 mya. The Lower Triassic is the oldest epoch of the Mesozoic era. These rocks were laid down just after the great Permian–Triassic extinction event.
The Lower Triassic was called the Scythian stage, which can be found in older literature. In Europe, most of the Lower Triassic is composed of sandstone. It is a lithostratigraphic unit of continental red beds. They were formed on land under desert conditions.
The massive extinctions that ended the Paleozoic era caused extreme hardship for the surviving species. Many types of corals, brachiopods, molluscs, echinoderms, and other invertebrates had completely disappeared. The most common hard-shelled marine invertebrates were bivalves, gastropods, ammonites, echinoids, and a few articulate brachiopods. The most common land animal was the herbivorous synapsid "Lystrosaurus". 
The earliest Triassic faunas lacked biodiversity and were like that throughout the epoch. Recovery on land took 30 million years. 
The first ichthyosaurs evolved in this epoch.
The climate during the Lower Triassic (especially in the interior of the supercontinent Pangaea) was generally dry. Deserts were widespread. The poles had a temperate climate. The relatively hot climate of the epoch may have been caused by widespread volcanic eruptions.

Middle Triassic

The Middle Triassic is the second of three epochs of the Triassic period. It lasted from about 247.2 million years ago (mya) to ~237 mya.
Once the middle series in the Triassic was known as the Muschelkalk. This name is now only used for a unit of rock strata of Middle Triassic age, found in western Europe.
Archosaurs were initially rarer than the therapsids which had dominated Permian terrestrial ecosystems, but they began to displace therapsids in the Middle Triassic. This 'Triassic takeover' may have contributed to the evolution of mammals. It forced the surviving therapsids and their mammalian successors to live as small, mainly nocturnal insectivores. Nocturnal life probably forced the proto-mammals to develop fur and higher metabolic rates. In their burrows, keeping warm, looking after the young and feeding them with milk were keys to their later success.
The ancestors of crocodiles, and the ancestors of pterosaurs and dinosaurs, were the most important archosaurs of this epoch.
In the Tethys Ocean, the first sauropterygia were present, the nothosaurs and early plesiosaurs. Ichthyosaurs had arrived in the Lower Triassic.

The Volkswagen Beetle is a car manufactured by the Volkswagen company. It was designed by Dr. Ferdinand Porsche. When it was introduced, it had gone through over a million miles of testing - more than any other car at the time.
The history of the car is the history of the Volkswagen company - the company was created to make that car. Other than some military vehicles during WWII, it was the only car the company made at first.
The car was made from 1949 to 2003, over 23 million of them. For many years, it held the record as the most-sold car ever. It took the record from the Model T Ford in 1971, and held it until 2000 when the Toyota Corolla took it away.
The basic shape and design of the car did not change. It was also powered by an engine in the rear, had a small trunk up front, and was air-cooled (no radiator).
More recently, the company made the New Beetle, which looked similar, followed by the present-day Beetle from 2012. These are completely different cars however, since they have a water-cooled engine in the front, and are very similar underneath to the Volkswagen Golf.
There are many Volkswagen clubs around the world, the members restore or modify the original air-cooled Volkswagens.

Ferdinand Porsche

Ferdinand Porsche (September 3, 1875January 30, 1951) was born in Austria. He was a talented and well-known car designer, especially of race cars. But he always wanted to make a small car useful for a family. Finally Adolf Hitler gave him the opportunity to make the Volkswagen Beetle in 1936. But by the time the car started production, war broke out, and the company started making army vehicles instead. After World War II he was put in a French jail for almost 2 years but never convicted of a crime. He was released, but his health had been damaged and he died not long afterwards. He lived long enough to see his beloved small car being successfully produced by the Volkswagen company, but not to see the great success it eventually became.
He started the Porsche company in 1931. At first it made designs and prototypes for others (including the Volkswagen Beetle). Later, under his son Ferry Porsche's leadership, it started making high-end cars. It continues to produce high power cars to this day.

George Balanchine

George Balanchine (Saint Petersburg, January 22, 1904 – New York, April 30, 1983) was a ballet dancer and choreographer. His father was Georgian and his mother Russian. 
He was one of the 20th century's most famous choreographers. He developed over 200 ballets, mostly in the United States. He was the co-founder and balletmaster of the New York City Ballet. He was a choreographer known for his musicality. He often with Igor Stravinsky: 39 of his ballets were choreographed to music by Stravinsky.
Balanchine was trained at the Imperial Ballet School in St Petersburg. After the Revolution he joined what is now the Mariinsky Ballet. He escaped when the company toured Germany. He was picked up by Sergei Diaghilev to be a dancer and choreographer for the Ballets Russes.
After Diaghilev's death, Balanchine stayed in Europe until 1933. Then he was taken to New York by a wealthy patron, Lincoln Kirstein. Together they formed the American Ballet School. Later they formed the American Ballet Company. This company became the 'house' dance group of the New York Metropolitan Opera. Later, in 1938, Balanchine moved the company to Hollywood.
In 1948 he moved back to New York. This was to head the New York City Ballet at the New York State Theater. He designed this theater. From 1946 to 1982 he choreographed many dances for this company. Balanchine died in 1983 of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
In 1922 18 year old Balanchine married 15 year old Tamara Geva. After his divorce from Geva, Balanchine was with Alexandra Danilova from 1926 through 1933. He married and divorced three more times, all to women who were his dancers. There was Vera Zorina (December 1938–1946), Maria Tallchief (1946–1952), and Tanaquil Le Clercq (1952–1969).

Kingdom Tower

Kingdom Tower is a skyscraper that is under construction. The tower is being built in Jeddah, a major port city on the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia. After its completion, Kingdom Tower will be the tallest building in the world, according to Construction Weekly. The consultants at Advanced Construction Technology Services state that the new tower will be approximately 1 kilometer (3,280 feet) high, which is significantly taller than the current Guinness World Record holder, the Burj Khalifa. In contrast, the Burj Khalifa is only 827 meters, or 2,716 feet high. 
Kingdom Tower will be the first part in a new project called Kingdom City, a planned suburb of Jeddah, with plans to eventually become a new city entirely. Plans for Kingdom Tower have been circulating since 2008, when it was originally named the "Mile-High Tower," for the obvious reason that it was going to be a mile high. However, the foundation where the Kingdom Holding Company wanted to build the tower was not stable enough to support such a large project. Instead, the company settled for the kilometer high title, where on August 2, 2011, Kingdom Holding announced that construction would commence soon, as the support for the tower had finally been gathered. The idea of Kingdom Tower is accredited to the Prince of Saudi Arabia, Al-Waleed bin Talal, whom also owns Kingdom Holding Company. The prince is the main contributor to this project, as he is known to be one of the wealthiest men in the world. 
However, many people are complaining that the tower is going to be a waste of much needed capital. The government has many problems and issues that require the money of the Saudi Arabian government, such as improving education and providing jobs that will benefit the country as a whole. As such, there are some that believe the country cannot afford to pursue such a large project. Many believe that this project is an elitist venture made simply to compete with the already-failed Burj Khalifa, which is known to be almost completely empty. Saudi Arabians and immigrants alike fear that the project is going to be a failure in stimulating the lagging economy of Saudi Arabia, and will instead add to the debt of the country. 
Still, others also believe that the project will benefit the economy of Saudi Arabia, bringing in much needed jobs to help construct the building, and will bring in a large amount of tourism already concentrated within the Hejaz area where Jeddah resides.

<doc id="305100" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305100" title="Harmonium">
Harmonium

A harmonium, also called a "melodeon", "reed organ" or "pump organ", is a keyboard instrument that is a lot like an organ. It makes sound by blowing air through reeds, which are tuned to different pitches to make musical notes.
A harmonium can be made to work using either the feet or the hands:
The hand-pumped harmonium was created by Dwakranath Ghose so that the instrument could be played while the player was sitting down on the floor. It is used in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Afghanistan and in other Asian countries as an accompanying instrument in Hindustani classical music, Sufi Music, Bhajan and other devotional music, Qawwali, Natya Sangeet, and a variety of genres including accompaniment to Classical Kathak Dance. Nomadic singers string it and wear it around their shoulders taking part in village fairs and festivals.
Harmonium with a Swarmandal (a small, harp-like instrument, similar to Zither and Autoharp) was produced by Bhishmadev Vedi. As the Swaramandal box was too big for the Harmonium, his disciple Manohar Chimote fixed the strings within the breadth of the instrument naming it as ‘Samvadini’. This instrument allows the strings to be played by the hand on the bellows, and keys by the other hand. Chimote provided a new natural ‘Gandhar’ tuning in this Harmonium. Although this tuning was limited to the 12 tones versus the 22 required in Hindustani classical music, it surely gave the European tuning of the Harmonium, an Indian flavour.
22-Shruti-Harmonium was created by Vidyadhar Oke (Indian Patent No. 250197). To achieve this, he first clarified the essential difference between 'Nada' and 'Shruti' and pinpointed the positions to play the 22 Microtones (Shrutis) on any string instrument. He documented the specific difference between 22 Shrutis versus the 12-Tone Equal temperament Scale. His 22-Shruti-Harmonium provides special knobs below each of the keys to regulate the reeds, making 22 Shrutis available within 12 keys. As this is a modified hand-pumped harmonium, no special playing skill is necessary. The 22-Shruti-Harmonium enables the creation of any Raga with all the notes perfectly consonant with a Tanpura. Additionally, by positioning all the knobs in the central position, the 22-Shruti-Harmonium can produce the sound of an Accordion.

The United States Military Academy at West Point (also known as West Point, USMA, Army (athletic teams)) is a university that teaches students to become officers in the US Army. Students are called "cadets" and are subject to military rules while studying subjects like engineering and military science for four years. For many years, West Point only taught men, but in 1976 West Point admitted its first female cadets. Women currently comprise approximately 15% of entering new cadets.
Military officers compose 75% of the faculty. Civilian professors make up the remaining 25% of faculty positions.
Congress formally authorized and funded West Point on 16 March 1802. West Point was so successful, that military academies were added later for the Navy, Coast Guard and Air Force.
West Point has a very broad sports program. All of its students are required to compete in at least one sport, either at the intramural (i.e., within the school) or intercollegiate (i.e., against other schools) level, in every semester.
The Army intercollegiate sports teams are nicknamed "Black Knights". Most Army teams play in the Patriot League. The football team plays at the highest level, known as Division I FBS, but is independent—not in any conference. The men's ice hockey team plays in Atlantic Hockey.

Barebacking is when people have sexual intercourse without using a condom. The term originated in the gay community, and was used to refer to unprotected anal sex. The word is related to "bareback", which means riding a horse without a saddle. Barebacking refers to a deliberate decision to not use a condom, forgetting to use a condom is not barebacking.
Barebacking is dangerous, because there is a high risk of infection with sexually transmitted diseases, such as Syphilis, or HIV. Even if both partners are HIV positive, there is a risk of infection with other strains of HIV. This may mean that the disease becomes more difficult to treat, or that certain drugs stop working.

<doc id="305111" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305111" title="Conscription">
Conscription

Conscription, also called draft, is when a government forces people to join the armed forces. Usually, only men are conscripted, but in Israel, women are as well. A soldier who has been forced to serve in the army is called a "conscript". Conscription is a very old way to build up armies, but also usually very unpopular, since very few men enjoy fighting and killing other people. Historically conscription was called "levy", but it was so unpopular that it was used only when the country was in really dire danger.
18th century Prussia had a conscript army but the first large, modern conscript army was the French Grand Army in the French Revolution. The leaders drafted all French men into the army. The result was that the French army was five times larger than that of neighbour countries, and the sheer numbers often won battles. While the French soldiers were less well trained and equipped than the soldiers of the neighbour armies, they were so many that they could win. Conscription became the universal way of making up the armies after the French Revolution. Almost all the powerful armies in the world except United Kingdom were conscripted armies. Without conscription, the large armies of World War One and World War Two would have been impossible to form.
Conscription armies are large, but they are often poorly equipped and trained and have poor morale. In combat they usually suffer many casualties. Usually conscripts serve with little pay and many are treated little better than slaves. Conscription can be considered as a form of forced labour. In many countries, young men who refuse to join the army are sentenced to prison. Many people "dodged" or illegally avoided conscription during the Vietnam War in the United States.
There are arguments for conscription. Some see it as fair, since everyone shares the burden of service. A small country with few people can make up a large enough army by conscription. If a country is in the midst of hostile neighbours and war can break up at any time, or if the country is a "buffer state" (= is located between two military blocks), training all available young people as soldiers can be a good idea.
The alternatives for conscription are militia system, as in Switzerland, or professional army made up from volunteers. The United States gave up conscription during the Cold War. The Vietnam War proved so unpopular that the Army no longer wanted conscripts, but volunteers, which have better motivation to serve. Most other Western World countries followed the American example and gave up conscription. Some American countries now have all-volunteer army and in Europe universal conscription remains only in some countries like Finland, Russia and Turkey.
In Germany, conscription for the Bundeswehr has been removed in July 2011 after a long discussion in the German Bundestag.
People who oppose conscription because of pacifism idea are called conscientious objectors. Some countries still draft conscientious objectors, but give them jobs where they will not have to fight in combat.

Limerick F.C.

Limerick Football Club is a football club based in Limerick, Ireland. The club currently play in the First Division of the League of Ireland. The first Limerick FC was created in 1937 and has had a number of names since its creation, known at different times as Limerick FC, Limerick United, and Limerick City. Under UEFA rules, the club could not get a licence to play in the First Division in 2007. A separate club, Limerick 37, was formed to replace Limerick FC in the league and competed under this name for two seasons. Limerick 37 has been renamed as Limerick FC. Although the current Limerick FC and Limerick 37 are a different club to the original Limerick FC, however there has only ever been one senior football club in Limerick City at one time since 1937.
Limerick FC won the League of Ireland title twice, in the 1959-60 and 1979-80 seasons, and the FAI Cup twice, in 1971 and 1982. They also won the League of Ireland Cup three times, 1976–77, 1992–93 and 2001-02. The club has competed in European competitions on six occasions, playing against bigger clubs such as Real Madrid and Southampton FC.
Limerick FC has used a number of stadiums around the city as their home ground over the years, including The Market's Field in Garryowen, Jackman Park on Carey's Road, Hogan Park in Rathbane, Thomond Park and Pike Rovers ground at Crossagalla. The Market's Field has always been considered to be the home of football in the city as the club enjoyed success at the venue and moving from there to Hogan Park heralded a serious decline in the club's fortunes. The club is currently using Jackman Park, which belongs to the Limerick District League (LDMC), for home games. It has a training base at Knocklisheen, on the north side of the city.
Limerick played in European competitions six times in its history. In 12 matches they scored 7 goals and while the club never won a European game, it drew twice. One of those draws was at The Dell against a Southampton team that included former European Footballer of the Year Kevin Keegan and Mick Channon. In the home fixture famous rugby international Tony Ward played well against a Yugoslav international defender Ivan Golac.
Limerick first competed in 1960 in the European Cup against Young Boys Berne, but suffered their heaviest aggregate defeat. Limerick moved their 1965 Cup Winners' Cup home leg to Dalymount Park - one of only two 'home' games played outside of Limerick. Interestingly, Pat Nolan is the only player ever to have scored for Limerick in Limerick in a European game.
The most famous European game was the 'home' match against Real Madrid in the European Cup in 1980. The match was played at Lansdowne Road where Dublin football fans stayed away en masse. Only 6,000 people watched the match. The final score 2-1 to Madrid. Des Kennedy scored twice in the tie, one at home and one away. English born Left winger Johnny Matthews had a 'goal' disallowed. Had it been given he would have completed a unique treble, as he had previously scored in European competition against Manchester United and Celtic while at Waterford United.

Emblem

An emblem is a pictorial image either abstract or representational. It represents a concept — for example, a moral truth, or an allegory — or a person, such as a king or saint. For example, the scallop shell is the traditional emblem of James, son of Zebedee. Pilgrims wore it on their hat or clothes to show that they were travelling to the shrine at Santiago de Compostela.

Tasman Bay

Tasman Bay is a large bay at the north of New Zealand's South Island. It is in the shape of a "V". It is in the middle of the island's northern coast. It is 120 km long and 70 km wide. It is a part of the coast of the Tasman Sea, on the western side of the Cook Strait.
At the western side of the bay, the land around has dense vegetation. The separation point between the Tasman Bay and the next bay, Golden Bay, is in the west. It is a part of the Abel Tasman National Park. On the east side, the bay is bounded by valleys of the Marlborough Sounds. 
A few rivers enter the sea at this point. Some of them are Waimea River, Riwaka, the Motueka and Serpentine River. Tasman Bay contains the rare rock formation known as the Boulder Bank.
The land around the centre of the bay is cultivated. It is well known for its crops like apples, kiwifruit, olives, grapes and hops. Tasman bay produced Tobacco there in the middle of the twentieth century. Now there is a Tobacco museum in Motueka. This is also the most populated part of the South Island's north coast. Several towns and the city of Nelson are there. Other large towns are Motueka, Riwaka and Richmond.

Fishing dredge

A fishing dredge, also known as a scallop dredge or an oyster dredge, is a kind of fishing net. It is pulled along the bottom of the sea by a fishing boat to collect scallops, oysters and other kind of clams, crabs, and sea cucumber. Fishermen then lift the dredge into the boat and empty it. 
In Europe, used to have "teeth" at the bottom, called tynes. These teeth raked or ploughed the sand and mud. This dug up buried clams. The New Bedford (USA) dredge does not have teeth.
Dredge nets have a gross mesh in order to let organisms smaller than the target organisms through. The net catches the larger organisms: in the case of scallop dredging that includes the scallops' predators, such as whelks, starfish and octopus. 
Sometimes three or four dredges are attached to a wheeled stiff axle. A number of these dredges can be towed from a heavy spreading bar. Usually there is one on each side of the ship. The length of the bar and the number of dredges towed is dependent on the power of the ship and the room on the side of the boat for working the dredges. There could be 3 on each side on a small 10 metre boat. There could be up to 20 on each side for a 30 metre ship with 1500 hp. The weight and strength of this can dig up the ground. It overturns rocks and can crush animals and plants in its path.
Scallops often contain sand when fishermen use dredges. It can also damage the seabed if they use dredges carelessly. These days scallop dredging is sometimes replaced by scuba diving. However inventors are trying to invent a better dredge.

Oyster Burns

Thomas P. "Oyster" Burns (September 6, 1864– November 11, 1928) was an American baseball player. He played 11 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Wilmington Quicksteps, Baltimore Orioles, Brooklyn Bridegrooms, and New York Giants. Burns mostly played as an outfielder. He also played as a shortstop, second baseman, third baseman and pitcher. Over his career he compiled a batting average of .300 with 1,392 hits, 65 home runs, and 834 runs batted in (RBI) in 1,188 games played. Burns spent most of his career in the major leagues. He also played in minor league baseball. He first played in MLB at age 19. In his playing days, Burns was tall and weighed .
Burns was nicknamed "Oyster" because he sold oysters in the off-season. He was described as a "loudmouth" with "an irritating voice and personality". Burns led the Bridegrooms to an American Association championship in 1889 and a National League pennant in 1890. He retired from baseball in 1901. He died on November 11, 1928, in Brooklyn, New York.
Burns was born on September 6, 1864, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents, Patrick and Mary Burns, both came to the United States from Ireland.
In 1883, Burns began his professional baseball career. He played as a pitcher for a minor league team in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. In his first season, Burns had an earned run average (ERA) of 2.30, and pitched in 20 games. When he was not pitching, Burns played second and third base.
Burns began the 1884 season playing for the Wilmington Quicksteps. He left the team on August 21, 1884, after they joined the Union Association. On the same day, Burns joined the Baltimore Orioles. At the age of 18, he was the youngest player on the Orioles. Burns played in only 35 games that season but had six home runs. He hit more home runs than any other player on the team that season. In 1885, he batted .231 with five home runs and 37 RBIs. Burns pitched to a 7–4 win–loss record. His low batting average, however, led him to be demoted to the Newark Domestics for the 1886 season. Burns helped the Domestics win the Eastern League pennant. By 1887, he returned to playing in the majors for the Orioles. He became the Orioles' team captain. Burns lost the role when he threw a baseball at a pitcher on another team. He was later fined $25.
Over the 1887 season, Burns hit nine home runs. He had 19 triples, which was tied with five other players for the American Association lead. He played in 140 games, which also tied for the league's lead.
After playing in 79 games for Baltimore, Burns was moved to the Brooklyn Bridegrooms by Harry Von der Horst. Von der Horst owned both teams. While playing for the Bridegrooms, the "New York Clipper" described Burns as "the noisiest man that ever played on the Brooklyn team. His voice reminds one of a buzz-saw." Burns remained with the Bridegrooms for the 1889 season. He had team highs in batting average and home runs. That season the Bridegrooms became American Association champions. In the World Series, the Bridegrooms played the New York Giants. Burns hit a three-run home run to win the fourth game of the series. This gave Brooklyn a 3–1 series lead. However, the Giants won the World Series after winning five straight games.
In 1890, the Bridegrooms moved to the National League. Burns, then 26, led the league in home runs (13) and RBIs (128). He hit for the cycle on August 1, 1890. He was the first Bridegroom to do so. The Bridegrooms won the National League pennant. In the 1890 World Series, the team played against the Louisville Colonels. The series ended in a 3–3–1 tie because of bad weather. In 1892, the Bridegrooms changed their name to the Grooms. Burns's RBI total was third highest in the league. His hits, doubles, triples, and batting average were the second highest on the Brooklyn team. In 1893, between games of a doubleheader, a teammate of Burns, Tom Daly, was sleeping in center field. Burns stabbed Daly with a knife. Daly woke up and turned into the knife. This led to a severed tendon which kept Daly out for two weeks. Burns' 1894 batting average (.355) was the highest of his career. He continued to play for the club until 1895, when he left the Grooms to play for the New York Giants. In his final MLB year, Burns batted .258 over 53 games.
After the 1895 season, Burns' contract was bought by the minor league Newark Colts. The Colts won the Atlantic League division with a 82–61 record. The next season, Burns served as a player-coach for the Hartford Bluebirds. He lead the team in doubles and batting average. In his final year managing, Burns coached for a minor league team in Portland, Maine.
After retiring from baseball, Burns lived in Brooklyn. He died on November 11, 1928. He was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in North Arlington, New Jersey.

Pacifier

A pacifier (called a dummy or soother in some countries) is an object that a baby sucks to comfort them. Sucking is a natural instinct for babies and it soothes them.
It generally consists of a teat (which is the part designed to be sucked) made from either silicone (a type of plastic) or latex (a form of rubber). Silicone is becoming more popular as it is more durable and easier to keep clean. The teat is mounted on a plastic plate which can vary in shape from circular, oval or butterfly shape. It can come in a variety of different colors with different designs like cartoon characters to make it look more appealing to the baby. The main purpose of the plastic mouth guard is to stop the baby from accidentally swallowing the pacifier. If for some reason the child is able to swallow it, the mouth guard is made to be too large to pass through the throat and if it should get lodged in the throat it also has holes to allow air to pass through so the child can still breathe. Finally there is sometimes a ring attached to allow the parent to remove the pacifier.
There is some concern that the use of pacifiers can affect the child's teeth so many teats now are a special shape to allow the teeth to form properly, these are called orthodontic teats. Non-orthodontic teats are sometimes called cherry teats.

Dame Margot Fonteyn DBE (born Peggy Hookham, Reigate, Surrey, 18 May 1919 – Panama City, 21 February 1991) was an English ballerina. She is widely regarded as one of the greatest classical ballet dancers of all time.
She spent her entire career as a dancer with the Royal Ballet, eventually being appointed "Prima Ballerina Assoluta" of the company by Queen Elizabeth II. This is an honour rarely given to a dancer. The highest rank in the Royal Ballet today is "Principal dancer". Fonteyn's appointment as a Dame commander of the British Empire is the female equivalent to a knighthood.
Fonteyn danced until 1979, when she was nearly 60. This is unusual for any dancer, male or female. Her career was expected to end round about 1960, but it was reborn by a new partnership with a Russian dancer who had escaped from the Soviet Union. He was Rudolph Nureyev, one of the three greatest male ballet dancers of the twentieth century. Though he was 19 years younger than her, the partnership flourished, and was called "the most famous partnership in ballet history".
She married a Panamanian politician in 1955. He survived an assassin's bullets ten years later. She continued dancing to raise money for his upkeep. The marriage was not happy; he had a mistress. However, the couple remained married until his death in 1989.
Several films were made of her performances.

Cosmic dust

Cosmic dust (also known as star dust and space dust) is a type of dust. It is very small crystals sent out from stars.
It is formed when a star, such as the Sun, sends out atoms. Some of the atoms become ions by gaining or losing electrons and becoming negatively and positively charged. These oppositely charged ions form an ionic bond, sticking together in tiny crystals, a few thousand nanometres across, to form cosmic dust.
Cosmic dust is split into further types of dust, based on the dust's location. These types include intergalactic dust, which can be found between galaxies, interstellar dust, found between stars, circumplanetary dust, which can be found around planets and in planetary rings and interplanetary dust, which can be found between planets. 
The coming together of large amounts of dust over time leads to the creation of planets, the Earth, for example.

Sautéing

Sautéing is a method of cooking food. It uses a small amount of fat in a shallow pan. The heat must be quite high. Ingredients are often cut into pieces or sliced thinly. It makes things cook faster. 
Food that is sautéed is browned, but it keeps the same texture, moisture and flavor. If meat, or fish is sautéed, the sauté is sometimes finished by using the pan's remains to make a sauce.
Sautéing is different from pan-frying. People sometimes confuse the two. In pan-frying larger pieces of food (for example, chops or steaks) are cooked quickly. Sautéing is also different from searing. Searing only browns the surface of the food. Olive oil or clarified butter are commonly used for sautéing. Most others fats will work too. Regular butter will produce more flavor. However it burns at a lower temperature and more quickly than other fats. This is because of the milk solids in it. Therefore clarified butter is better for sautéing.

Pippi Longstocking (book)

Pippi Longstocking () is a novel by Astrid Lindgren. It was originally published in Sweden on 26 November 1945. It is the first in a series of books about Pippi Longstocking. Pippi is a girl who lives alone in a house with her pets, a monkey named Mr. Nilsson and a horse that she keeps on the porch. She befriends Tommy and his sister Annika, who live next door to her.
As of 2009, the book has been translated into 64 languages.
Astrid Lindgren first thought of Pippi Longstocking in 1941. Her 7-year-old daughter Karin was sick and had to be kept in bed. She asked her mother to tell her a story, so Lindgren made up a character named Pippi Longstocking and some stories about her to entertain her daughter. In 1944, she wrote them down and sent the manuscript of the book to Bonnier Publishers. They said that they did not want to publish the book. When the publishing company Rabén and Sjögren announced a children's book contest on January 28 of the next year, she sent a new version of the book to the company. It won first prize and was published in 1945. Afterwards, Rabén and Sjögren would also publish the sequels, "Pippi Goes on Board" (1946) and "Pippi in the South Seas" (1948). Since then, the series has been translated into many other languages. It has also been adapted into a television series and two movies.
Pippi is a girl who is 9 years old. She lives alone in Villa Villekulla, an old house in a garden way out at the end of a small town (the name of the town is not given). She lives there all alone because her father, a sea captain called Captain Efraim Longstocking, disappeared when he was washed overboard in a storm and her mother died when she was very young. Pippi believes that her mother is now an angel in Heaven, watching her through a peephole and her father, instead of drowning after being washed overboard, had actually floated to an island filled with cannibals and become a cannibal king.
Luckily for her, her father had bought Villa Villekulla many years ago so that when he would grow old he would move into the house with his daughter. So Pippi decides to move into the house with the two things she had taken from her father's ship: her pet monkey named Mr. Nilsson (a present from her father) and a suitcase filled with gold coins. After moving into the house, she also buys a horse, which she keeps on the porch. She likes living alone because nobody orders her to go to bed and no one forces her to take cod liver oil, when she likes candy more.
Beside the house, there is another house in which there live two well-behaved siblings named Annika and Tommy. They first meet Pippi when she is out on the road in the morning, walking backwards. They ask her about this and she answers that a person can walk any way she wants to in a free country. She continues to tell them that in Egypt, all the people walk backwards and nobody thinks it is strange. After they ask her whether she actually has been to Egypt, she answers that she has and that in Farthest India, the people have an even stranger way of walking: they walk on their hands. At this, they accuse her of lying and then she admits that she was lying and that in the Congo nobody speaks the truth.
Afterwards, she invites them over to her house, where they eat pancakes and Pippi tells them about Brazilians, who always have eggs in their hair. Then she shows them some of the things which she and her father brought home from their journeys around the world. From these, Pippi gives them some gifts: Tommy gets a small knife with a handle of pearl and Annika gets a ring with a green stone. Annika and Tommy then go back to their home.

Ringstraße

The Ringstraße (also known as "Ring") is a street in Austria's capital Vienna. It goes around the first district in almost the shape of a circle. The street is 5.2 km long and is divided into nine sections. It is one of the main sights in Vienna.
On December 20th, 1857, emperor Franz Joseph I. ordered to destroy the old city walls and to build a street which should show the glory of the Habsburg Empire. The old walls were a traffic block because in 1850, the suburbs became part of the city as districts II. till IX. The order of the emperor outlined the exact size of the boulevard, as well as the geographical positions and functions of the new buildings. The only building which was erected by the city was the Town Hall.
During the following years, a large number of important public and private buildings were erected. Nobility and bourgeoisie began to build mansions along the street. Most of them were built in the Ringstraßenstyle, which mainly quotes older styles.
The Ringstraße has several sections. It surrounds the central area of Vienna on all sides, except for the northeast, where its place is taken by the "Franz-Josephs-Kai", the street going along the "Donaukanal" (a branch of the Danube). Starting from the "Ringturm" at the northern end of the Franz-Josephs-Kai, the sections are:

Otto Wagner

Otto Koloman Wagner (13 July 1841 – 11 April 1918) was an Austrian architect and urban planner. He influenced the development of his hometown Vienna at the turn from the 19th to the 20th century. He also was the architect of important landmarks.
Otto Wagner was born in the Penzing district of Vienna. He studied in Berlin and Vienna. After work as brick layer he started as architect. His first buildings were in the historism style. In the late 1880s he became a proponent of the realism style. In 1890 he designed a city plan for Vienna but only the railway netwerk Wiener Stadtbahn was built. In 1894 he became Professor of Architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna.In 1896 he published a textbook entitled Modern Architecture in which he wrote down his ideas about the role of the architect, it based on his first lecture in the Academy. He called for an architecture based on modern materials and modern construction methods. In 1897, he joined Gustav Klimt, Joseph Maria Olbrich, Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser shortly after they founded the "Vienna Secession" artistic group. He died in 1918 in Vienna.

Ninette de Valois

Dame Ninette de Valois OM CH DBE FRAD FISTD (6 June 1898 – 8 March 2001) was an Irish-born British dancer, teacher, choreographer and director of classical ballet. 
Most notably, she danced professionally with Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, reaching the rank of soloist. After Diaghilev's death she established what became The Royal Ballet. This became one of the foremost ballet companies of the 20th century and one of the leading ballet companies in the world today. She also established the Birmingham Royal Ballet and the Royal Ballet School. She is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of ballet and as the 'godmother' of English ballet.
Before de Valois there had been no permanent ballet company in London, though there were a few quality dance schools which offered shows from time to time. The company which became the Royal Ballet started as the Vic-Wells Ballet, founded by de Valois in 1931. It had Anton Dolin as its Guest dancer. In 1933 the company was joined by Alicia Markova, who was appointed "prima ballerina". At this point de Valois retired as a stage performer, and continued as Director. Her reputation was now made as an organiser and teacher. She was also a choreographer, with a number of ballets to her credit. Her ballet "Checkmate" is still danced today. 
'Madame', as she was called by everyone, attracted great talents to the company. She engaged Frederick Ashton as Principal Choreographer and Constant Lambert as Musical Director, in 1935. Tamara Karsavina was a dance advisor. Eventually the company included many of the most famous ballet dancers in the world, including Margot Fonteyn, Svetlana Beriosova, and, most sensationally, Rudolf Nureyev. 
As a manager, she had a fearsome reputation. She would stand for no misbehaviour, or for anything which stood in the way of the dance. One younger dancer said:
The Vic-Wells was given a Royal Charter in 1956, and became the Royal Ballet. Madame was its first Director. She retired from the Royal Ballet in 1963, but was a big influence for years. She was appointed a Companion of Honour, and awarded the Order of Merit. Madame died at the age of 102 in 2001.

A Wrinkle in Time

A Wrinkle in Time is a science fiction and fantasy novel by Madeleine L'Engle. It was first published in 1962. The book won the 1963 Newbery Medal and the 1965 Sequoyah Book Award. It also won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1964.
"A Wrinkle in Time" is the story of Meg Murry, a high-school-aged girl who is transported on an adventure through time and space with her younger brother Charles Wallace and her friend Calvin O'Keefe to rescue her father, a gifted scientist, from the evil forces that hold him prisoner on another planet. At the beginning of the book, Meg is a homely, awkward, but loving girl, troubled by personal insecurities and her concern for her father, who has been missing for over a year. The plot begins with the arrival of Mrs. Whatsit at the Murry house on a dark and stormy evening. Although she looks like an eccentric tramp, she is actually a celestial creature with the ability to read Meg's thoughts. She startles Meg's mother by reassuring her of the existence of a tesseract--a sort of "wrinkle" in space and time. It is through this wrinkle that Meg and her companions will travel through the fifth dimension in search of Mr. Murry.
On the afternoon following Mrs. Whatsit's visit, Meg and Charles Wallace walk over to Mrs. Whatsit's cabin. On the way, they meet Calvin O'Keefe, a popular boy in Meg's school whom Charles considers a kindred spirit. The three children learn from Mrs. Whatsit and her friends Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which that the universe is threatened by a great evil called the Dark Thing and taking the form of a giant cloud, engulfing the stars around it. Several planets have already succumbed to this evil force, including Camazotz, the planet on which Mr. Murry is imprisoned.
The three Mrs. W's transport the children to Camazotz and instruct them to remain always in each other's company while on their quest for Mr. Murry. On Camazotz, all objects and places appear exactly alike because the whole planet must conform to the terrifying rhythmic pulsation of IT, a giant disembodied brain. Charles Wallace tries to fight IT with his exceptional intelligence but is overpowered by the evil and becomes a robot-like creature mouthing the words with which IT infuses him. Under the control of IT, Charles leads Meg and Calvin to Mr. Murry and together they confront IT. However, they, too, are unable to withstand IT's power; they escape only at the last minute, when Mr. Murry appears and seizes Meg and Calvin, "tessering" away with them (traveling via another tesseract) to a gray planet called Ixchel inhabited by tall, furry beasts who care for the travelers. Charles Wallace remains possessed by IT, a prisoner of Camazotz.
On Planet Ixchel the three Mrs. W's appear once again, and Meg realizes that she must travel alone back to Camazotz to rescue her brother. Mrs. Which tells her that she has one thing that IT does not have, and this will be her weapon against the evil. However, Meg must discover this weapon for herself. When standing in the presence of IT, Meg realizes what this is: her ability to love. Thus, by concentrating on her love for Charles Wallace, she is able to restore him to his true identity. Meg releases Charles from IT's clutches and tessers with him through time and space, landing in her twin brothers' vegetable garden on Earth, where her father and Calvin stand waiting. The family joyously reunites, and the Mrs. W's visit the happy scene en route to further travels.
Meg Murry -  The book's heroine and protagonist, a homely, awkward, but loving high school student who is sent on an adventure through time and space with her brother and her friend Calvin to rescue her father from the evil force that is attempting to take over the universe. Meg's greatest faults are her anger, impatience, and lack of self-confidence, but she channels and overcomes them, ultimately emerging victorious.
Charles Wallace Murry  -  Meg's extraordinarily intelligent five-year-old younger brother who is capable of reading minds and understanding other creatures in a way that none of the other Murry children can.
Calvin O'Keefe -  A popular boy and talented athlete in Meg's high school who accompanies the Murry children on their adventure. Calvin comes from a large family that does not really care about him, but he nonetheless demonstrates a strong capacity for love and affection, and shows a burgeoning romantic interest in Meg.
IT -  The disembodied brain that controls all the inhabitants of Camazotz with its revolting, pulsing rhythm. IT, identified with the Black Thing, is the embodiment of evil on this planet.
The Black Thing  -  A cold and dark shadow that symbolizes the evil forces that Meg, Calvin, and Charles Wallace must fight against in order to rescue their father.
Mrs. Whatsit -  The youngest of the three celestial beings who accompany the children on their adventure. Meg initially comes to know Mrs. Whatsit as the tramp who stole bed-sheets from their neighbors and then sought shelter from a storm in the Murrys' warm kitchen. She later learns that Mrs. Whatsit gave up her existence as a star in order to fight the Dark Thing.
Mrs. Which -  The oldest of the three celestial beings who accompany the children on their adventure. Mrs. Which has difficulty materializing and is usually just a shimmering gleam. Her unconventional speech is usually rendered in capitalized words, with the first consonants repeated several times.
Mrs. Who -  The second of the three celestial beings who accompany the children on their adventure. She usually speaks in quotations from famous thinkers and writers because she finds it too difficult to craft her own sentences. When the children first meet Mrs. Who, she is sewing sheets in the haunted house in their neighborhood.
Mr. Murry  -  Meg's father and a physicist who works for a top-secret government agency on experiments with travel through space-time in the fifth dimension. In trying to tesser to Mars (i.e., travel through a tesseract, or wrinkle in time), he is captured and imprisoned on the dark planet of Camazotz. When the plot begins, no one on Earth has heard from him for over a year.
Aunt Beast -  This tall, furry, many-tentacled inhabitant of the planet Ixchel cares lovingly for Meg after she is nearly destroyed by the Black Thing. Aunt Beast, like all the creatures on Ixchel, lacks eyes and has no concept of light or vision.
Happy Medium -  A jolly, clairvoyant woman in a silk turban and satin gown who shows the children a vision of Earth through her crystal ball. The Medium is reluctant to show them anything unpleasant, but the Mrs. W's insist that they see what they are up against.
Man with the Red Eyes  -  A robot-like inhabitant of Camazotz who tries to hypnotize Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin in the CENTRAL Central Intelligence building. The Man, like all of Camazotz, is totally controlled by the power of IT.
Mrs. Murry  -  Meg's mother and an experimental biologist who works out of a lab in the Murry home. She is at once a brilliant scientist and a loving mother who cooks meals for her family on her Bunsen burner. She also writes loving letters to her absent husband every night.
Mr. Jenkins -  Meg's cold and unfeeling high-school principal who calls her "belligerent and uncooperative" and implies that her family is in denial about Mr. Murry's true whereabouts.
Mrs. Buncombe -  The wife of the constable in Meg's hometown, who has twelve bed-sheets stolen from her at the beginning of the novel.
Sandy and Dennys Murry  -  Meg's athletic and socially successful ten-year-old twin brothers who encourage her to let them fight off the bullies who make fun of Charles Wallace. The twins do not accompany Meg and Charles Wallace on their interplanetary adventure.

<doc id="305321" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305321" title="Rocket candy">
Rocket candy

Rocket candy is a type of fuel that pushes model rockets. The fuel burns and pushes air out of the rocket's nozzle (the narrowest part of the motor), which pushes the rocket in a forward direction. Rocket candy is not really a type of candy. It is made of sugar, but it is used to power rockets. Rocket candy is made of three different parts. The three parts are the fuel, the part that uses oxygen (air) to make the fuel burn more completely, and the extra chemicals. The fuel is made of a sugar. Sucrose is the most commonly used type of sugar. Sucrose is known as table sugar. The most common part that uses oxygen to make the fuel burn more completely is potassium nitrate (KNO). This part is also called an oxidizer. The extra chemicals can be many different things. They can change the speed of the fuel burning. Extra chemicals can also make the liftoff and flight more exciting and interesting to watch. A normal rocket candy ‘recipe’ is made of 65% oxidizer and 35% fuel. 
Rocket candy is made in different ways. One of these ways is ‘dry compression’. For dry compression, the rocket candy does not need to be heated. The parts need to be ground into small particles. Then the mixture is packed into the motor. Another way to make rocket candy is called ‘dry heating’. Dry heating does not actually melt the KNO (chemical used as the oxidizer), but it melts the sugar and then the KNO is mixed into the sugar. There is also a third way of making rocket candy called ‘dissolving and heating’. In dissolving and heating, the mixture of fuel ingredients is heated, and both the oxidizer and the fuel are melted and then combine together. 
Rocket candy should never be made right above a flame. This is for safety reasons. If the mixture of ingredients is heated over direct heat, it could explode. It could also cause the fuel to be weaker. Making rocket candy in a microwave oven is also dangerous. This can cause the fuel to catch on fire. Rocket candy catches on fire very easily. Therefore, it should be made in small amounts. It should also be made outside or in another safe place. One should also use safety eye glasses.
Rocket candy does not perform as well as some other kinds of fuel used in model rockets. The total amount of power is lower. The amount of power based on the amount of fuel is also lower. However, rocket candy costs a lot less to make than many other fuels.
Rocket candy is made of three main parts. It is made out of the fuel, the oxidizer, and the extra chemicals. The fuel is the part that burns. When it burns, it makes hot gases that move quickly out of the rocket motor. These quickly moving gases push the rocket as they exit the motor. The oxidizer helps to add oxygen, which the fuel needs to burn. The extra chemicals can do a few things. Some can speed up the burning. Some can also make the fuel burn more completely. Some extra chemicals make the rocket look better when it is launched. They can add sparks and flames to liftoff. They can also add smoke when the rocket flies.
Many different sugars can be used as the fuel for rocket candy. Sucrose, which is the sugar used in home kitchens, is the most common type of sugar used. Sorbitol, a common sugar substitute, is also used. Sorbitol makes the rocket candy break less easily. It also causes the fuel to burn more slowly. Fructose and glucose are harder to use. They make the rocket candy more likely to explode. Fructose and glucose do not have to be heated as much. This makes preparation easier. There are more sugars that can be used. They are not as well known, including erythritol, xylitol, lactitol, maltitol, or mannitol. 
The oxidizer helps there be more oxygen in the rocket candy when the fuel is burning. The most common oxidizer is a chemical called potassium nitrate. Its chemical formula is KNO. Other oxidizers can be used instead. Potassium nitrate can be bought from stores that carry garden supplies. 
There are two problems that people often have when they use potassium nitrate. The most important thing is to make sure that the potassium nitrate used is pure potassium nitrate. It is possible to buy potassium nitrate. However, potassium nitrate for sale may not be pure potassium nitrate. Another important thing about the oxidizer is the size of the particles. Many people who make rocket candy have an exact size that they want the potassium nitrate to be. This can be done using a coffee grinder. 
Extra chemicals are often added to rocket candy. They are used to change the way the fuel burns. These extra chemicals can make the rocket candy burn faster or slower. Some are used to change the color of the flame. Other chemicals are used to make smoke when the rocket flies. Some extra chemicals are used to change the way the fuel feels and acts. They can make the fuel less likely to break. They can also make the fuel more like a flowing liquid. This can make it easier to put the rocket candy into the motor. 
People use many different extra chemicals. These are just the ones that are used the most. Metal oxides are one group of extra chemicals. These make the rocket candy burn faster. Metal oxides work best at levels from 1 to 5 percent. This means between one and five grams of extra chemical for every one hundred grams in the fuel. The most common metal oxide is called iron oxide. The most common type of iron oxide is red iron oxide. There are also other colors. Red is the most easy to buy. There is also yellow, brown, and black iron oxide. 
Another extra chemical that is sometimes added to rocket candy is carbon. Carbon is found in charcoal or graphite. It is sometimes used as a fuel. It is used more often as an extra chemical. It makes the rocket leave a smoke trail in the sky. When the fuel burns, it makes heat. The heat usually goes to the case of the motor. The carbon keeps some of the heat in the fuel instead. 
A metal called titanium is sometimes used as an extra chemical. It is added in flakes to the rocket candy. Titanium makes the rocket make sparks and flames when it is launched.
Rocket candy is normally made with 65% oxidizer and 35% fuel. This has a little more fuel than one needs. This way allows the rocket candy to be more liquid when it is melted. Extra chemicals can take the place some of the fuel. When extra chemicals are added the recipe can change. It might change to 65% oxidizer, 25% fuel, and 10% extra chemicals. These are not the only combinations that work. There are many different combinations that will still make a rocket fly. 
There are a number of different ways to make rocket candy. Most of the ways include heating the rocket candy. The different ways to make rocket candy are called: dry compressed, dry heated, and dissolved and heated. 
In dry compression, the sugar and potassium nitrate are chopped. They should be ground as small as possible. Some people use a mortar and pestle to grind them. Others use a coffee grinder. Then they are mixed. They can be mixed in something called a ball mill or a tumbler. These machines make sure that the two are mixed completely. Then the mixture is pressed into the motor tube. Most people who are serious about experiments do not use this method. People should think carefully before they choose this method. 
Another way to make rocket candy is called dry heating. This is more common than dry compression. First, the potassium nitrate is ground or milled. It needs to be made into a powder. Then the potassium nitrate is mixed with powdered sugar in a pot. When the heat is turned on, the sugar melts. However, this method does not actually melt the potassium nitrate. Potassium nitrate needs to be very hot before it melts. Its melting temperature is 613 degrees Fahrenheit. So instead of melting, the grains of potassium nitrate are coated with the melted sugar. 
Dissolving and heating is another way to make rocket candy. James Yawn is a well known person who experiments on rockets. He uses dissolving and heating. This method completely combines both the sugar and the potassium nitrate. First, the potassium nitrate and sugar are placed in a pot. Then a little bit of water is added. The sugar and the potassium nitrate combine with the water and make a liquid. When this happens, you cannot see the particles anymore. This is called dissolving. Then the pot is heated. It is heated until the water is hot enough to become a gas and leave the mixture. The mixture will go through several steps. First it will boil. Then it will bubble and ‘spit’. Spitting means that the fuel might splatter. After that it becomes creamy. Dissolving and heating is good for several reasons. The potassium nitrate and sugar do not have to be powder. This is because they both end up together as part of a liquid. This way to make rocket candy also means that the person preparing the fuel has more time to pack it into the motors. 
Performance of a model rocket is shown by two or three things:
1. Highest force: How much force the gases make when they move out of the rocket motor is different at different times. People often want to know what is the highest force a rocket motor makes. Highest force is measured in Newtons (N).
2. Impulse: Impulse is a measurement of how much force a rocket motor makes, and for how long. A motor that makes a low force for a long time can sometimes have a higher impulse than a motor that makes a high force for a short time. Impulse is measured in Newtons times seconds (N*s).
3. Specific Impulse: If a motor has more fuel, then it will have a higher impulse. There is a way to find out if one fuel makes the same impulse as another fuel. When the number for impulse is divided by the number for the weight of the fuel that was burned, it is called 'specific impulse.' To find out how much fuel was burned, the rocket motor must be weighed before and after firing. The specific impulse can be compared for different fuels and different sizes of rocket motors. Specific impulse is measured in seconds (s).
Sugar based rocket fuels have an average I(specific impulse) of between 115 and 130 seconds. Compare that to the average I of an APCP (Ammonium perchlorate composite fuel), which is 150 to 180 seconds. The most force that sorbitol and KNO based fuel with a typical 65:35 ratio can make is 110 N, an I of between 110 and 125 seconds, and may have an average force of about 40 N. However, sorbitol and KNO rockets with extra chemicals have been recorded as having average forces of up to 100N, total impulses of up to 735 Ns, and specific impulses of up to 128 seconds.
Xylitol and KNO based rocket fuels can make a specific impulse of ~ 100 seconds and can have a total impulse of up to 230Ns.
Dextrose and KNO based fuels can make an average force of about 80N, a total impulse of 144 Ns, and an I of 118 seconds.
Rocket candy is also sometimes called “caramel candy”. Rocket candy was used in some of the model rockets created by Homer Hickam. He describes these in his best-selling, true book, "Rocket Boys". 
Rocket candy might have been made well known to beginning rocket enthusiasts by Lt. Col. Charles M. Parkin in a long magazine (Electronics Illustrated) article. It continued over several issues. The article was published in July 1958. Parkin wrote about how to make rocket candy by using an electric frying pan. Parkin also wrote a book. It was called "The Rocket Handbook for Amateurs". It was published in 1959. 
Today there is a program called the Sugar Shot to Space Program. This program is trying to make a very powerful rocket powered by rocket candy. The goal is to get this kind of rocket into space. Space is defined as 100 kilometers high. This is the same as 60 miles from the earth’s surface. One of the rockets is called the “Double Sugar Shot rocket”. It has reached 33 kilometers, or twenty miles from the earth’s surface. This means that it is one third of the way to space. The “Mini Sugar Shot rocket” is another rocket. It is a smaller version of the “Extreme Sugar Shot rocket”. The “Mini Sugar Shot Rocket” reached a height of about seven miles. Then it exploded. The “Extreme Sugar Shot rocket” is the rocket that might get into space. It is not yet finished being built.

Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9

Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 was a comet. It broke apart and crashed into Jupiter, in July 1994. The event was special because people could see, for the first time, how objects in the Solar System, outside Earth, collided. It caused a large amount of coverage in the media. The comet was carefully watched by astronomers worldwide. The crash gave new information about Jupiter. It also showed up its role in reducing space debris in the inner Solar System. The name came out of the discovers' last names.
The comet was discovered by astronomers Carolyn and Eugene M. Shoemaker and David Levy on March 24, 1993. It was found in a picture taken by the Schmidt telescope at the Palomar Observatory, in California. When it was discovered, it was orbiting Jupiter. It was the first comet seen to be orbiting a planet. Scientists think that it had been orbiting the planet for 20 - 30 years before its discovery. 
Calculations showed that its unusual broken up form was due to a previous closer approach to Jupiter in July 1992. At that time, the orbit of Shoemaker-Levy 9 passed within Jupiter's Roche limit. Jupiter's tidal forces had acted to pull the comet apart. The comet was later observed as a series of pieces up to in diameter. These fragments collided with Jupiter's southern hemisphere between July 16 and July 22, 1994. The pieces were moving at a speed of approximately 60 km/s. The impact scars were more easily seen than the Great Red Spot and they stayed for many months.

<doc id="305331" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305331" title="Division by two">
Division by two

In mathematics, division by two is when a number is divided by two. Some cultures, like the ancient Egyptians, thought this was a different operation than division. Some mathematicians up until the 16th century (1500-1599) thought this too. Today division by two is handled specially in modern computer programming.
Division by two is also called halving, mediation, and dimidiation.
In a binary number system, there are only two digits: 0 and 1. All other numbers are represented with those two digits. For example, "one" is 1, "two" is 10, "three" is 11, "four" is 100, and so on. Most of the time people use a number system with ten digits (the numbers 0 through 9.) This is called the decimal number system.
Division by two in binary is very easy. It is done by dropping the last digit on the right of the number. This is called a "bit shift operation." For example, if we performed a bit shift operation on the binary number 100, we'd get 10. Since binary 100 is decimal 4, and binary 10 is decimal 2, this makes sense.
Another example is performing a bit shift operation on 1101. This would leave us with 110, but we dropped a 1 from the end, not a zero. This also makes sense because 1101 in binary is 13 in decimal. If we divide 13 by 2, we get 6 with a remainder of 1 (we have 1 left over.)
Computers use the binary number system to store information. Information is broken up into tiny pieces called "bits". Each bit is either a 0 or a 1. Because of this, the fastest and easiest way for a computer to do division is by a bit shift operations -- division by two. Replacing regular division with bit shifts is a way to do program optimization. (Program optimization is trying to make a program faster and more efficient.)
In computer programming, the symbol codice_1 is sometimes used to show a bit shift operation. In Java, we can ask the computer to do the problem formula_1 by writing codice_2. This is the same as writing codice_3. Both of these versions will give us the answer codice_4. There is a problem when trying to do something a problem like formula_2. In Java, if we write codice_5, the computer will tell us the answer is codice_6. But if we try to do codice_7, the computer will say the answer is codice_8. This will happen every time we try to do a bit shift operation with one negative number. The reason for this is complicated, and has to do with the way negative binary numbers are saved by the computer.
Even though it is fastest for computers to do division using bit shift operations, most computer code does not do it this way. This is because programmers want their programs to be "portable" and "readable". Portable means that a program can be run on many different kinds of computers and operating systems. Readable means that the source code is easy to read and understand. Most of the time, the compiler (a program that changes source code into 0's and 1's that the computer can understand) will change the division into bit shifts automatically.

Imprinting

Imprinting is a term used in ethology and psychology to describe a special type of automatic learning.
It usually occurs early in life, during a critical period. The animal fixes on a particular signal (sound or sight), which is said to be 'imprinted' onto the subject. The process of imprinting is caused by an inherited instinct.
The best-known form of imprinting is the imprinting of the newly-hatched (or born) on one or both parent. Its function is to keep the young near their parent(s) during the early learning period. It is most obvious in birds, such as ducks and geese, after the fledglings have left the nest. They imprint on their parents and then follow them around, often in a long line, on land and on water. 
It was first reported in domestic chickens, by the 19th-century amateur biologist Douglas Spalding. It was rediscovered by the early ethologist Oskar Heinroth, and studied extensively and popularised by his disciple Konrad Lorenz, and by Niko Tinbergen. 
Lorenz showed how incubator-hatched geese would imprint on the first suitable moving stimulus they saw within what a 'critical period' of 13–16 hours after hatching. For example, the goslings would imprint on Lorenz himself (to be more specific, on his wading boots). He is often shown in photographs being followed by a gaggle of geese who had imprinted on him. 
In child development, the term is used to refer to the process by which a baby learns who its mother and father are. The process is recognised as beginning in the womb, when the unborn baby starts to recognise its parents' voices.
The filial imprinting of birds was a primary technique used to create the movie "Winged Migration (Le Peuple Migrateur)", which contains footage of migratory birds in flight. The birds imprinted on handlers, who wore yellow jackets and honked horns constantly. The birds were then trained to fly along with a variety of aircraft, usually ultralights.

Vienna Secession

The Vienna Secession (also known as the "Union of Austrian Artists", or "Vereinigung Bildender Künstler Österreichs") was formed in 1897 by a group of Austrian artists who left the Association of Austrian Artists, housed in the Vienna Künstlerhaus due to its conservatism. This movement included painters, sculptors, and architects. The first president of the Secession was Gustav Klimt, and Rudolf von Alt was made honorary president.
It was founded on 3 April 1897 by artists Gustav Klimt, Koloman Moser, Josef Hoffmann, Joseph Maria Olbrich, Max Kurzweil, and others. Although the architect Otto Wagner is one of the most important members he was not a founding member. The first exhibition was held in 1898. In 1898, the group's exhibition house was built near Karlsplatz. It was designed by Joseph Maria Olbrich, the exhibition building soon became known simply as "the Secession" (die Sezession). Their work was also published in a magazin called "Ver sacrum".
1903 Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser founded the Wiener Werkstätten, a union of artists who wanted to reform the applied arts (arts and crafts). 1905 Klimt and other artists left the group due to different opinions about art.

Ken Olsen

Kenneth Harry Olsen (February 20, 1926 — February 6, 2011) was an American engineer and entrepreneur. He started Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1957 with Harlan Anderson.
Olsen was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut. He grew up in nearby Stratford, Connecticut. His father's parents came from Norway and his mother's parents came from from Sweden. Olsen began his career working summers in a machine shop. Olsen fixed radios in his basement as a child.
He served in the United States Navy between 1944 and 1946. Then Olsen studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He earned a Bachelor of Science in 1950 and a Master of Science degree in 1952. Both degrees were in electrical engineering.
While he was studying at MIT, the Office of Naval Research of the United States Department of the Navy asked Olsen to help build a computerized flight simulator. Also while at MIT, Olsen directed a project to make the first transistorized research computer. Olsen also worked as an engineer at MIT Lincoln Laboratory on the TX-2 project.
In 1957, Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson, decided to start their own company. Harlan was also at MIT. They asked American Research and Development Corporation (ARDC) for money. ARDC was an early venture capital company started by Georges Doriot. In the 1960s, Olsen received patents for a saturable switch, a diode transformer gate circuit, an improved version of magnetic core memory, and the line printer buffer. Their company's headquarters was in an old wool mill in Maynard, Massachusetts. In 1992, the company had their best sales of $14,000,000,000. DEC was sold to Compaq for $9,600,000,000 in 1999. It later became a part of Hewlett-Packard.
Ken Olsen was known throughout his career for his fatherly management style and for supporting new ideas in engineering. He thought new ideas and technical excellence were very important. He used engineering matrix management. This management approach is used throughout many industries today.
He was awarded the Vermilye Medal in 1980.
In 1986, "Fortune Magazine" named Olsen "America's most successful entrepreneur", and the same year he received the IEEE Engineering Leadership Recognition Award.
In 1987 he gave the first of his "snake oil speeches". Some people thought he was talking about the "Unix Conspiracy". Olsen believed VMS was a better operating system for DEC customers than UNIX. He said why VMS was good. Yet, he did approve and encourage a plan inside DEC to make a UNIX for VAX computers based on BSD. This version of UNIX was called Ultrix. However, Ultrix never got good support from within DEC.
Olsen retired from DEC in 1992. He then became the chairman of Advanced Modular Solutions. Olsen was also a major contributor to The Family, a religious and political organization. Olsen also was a trustee of Gordon College in Wenham, Massachusetts. The college named a science center after him.
Olsen died while in hospice care in Indianapolis, Indiana on February 6, 2011, aged 84. The cause of death was not announced. His family also did not speak publicly about how he died.
Two things Olsen said are often repeated but without information to help people understand what he really meant.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz

Debbie Wasserman Schultz (born September 27, 1966) is the U.S. Representative for since 2005. She was the Chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, the leader the Democratic Party from 2011 until she resigned in 2016. From 1993 to 2004, she served in the Florida House of Representatives and the Florida Senate.
Her district covers parts of Broward and Miami-Dade counties. Her district includes the cities of Fort Lauderdale and Miami Beach.
She was born Deborah Wasserman in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City. She grew up on Long Island. She received a Bachelor of Arts in 1988 and a Master of Arts with certificate in political campaigning in 1990, both in Political Science, from the University of Florida, in Gainesville.
At the University of Florida, Schultz was in student government. She was President of the Student Senate as well as founder and President of the Rawlings Area Council Government. She was also a member of the Omicron Delta Kappa honor society, the James C. Grimm chapter of the National Residence Hall Honorary, and the union Graduate Assistants United. She served as President of the Graduate Student Council. She said that student politics developed her "love for politics and the political process."
In 1988 Schultz became an aide to Peter Deutsch at the beginning of his state legislative career. In 1992, Deutsch won election to the United States House of Representatives, which made his Florida post vancant. Schultz recalled getting a call from Deutsch at the time: "It was really amazing. He called me at home one day in the middle of the legislative session and he said, 'You could run in my race, your house is in my district.'" She had lived in the district for only three years. Schultz then won 53 percent of the vote in a six-way Democratic primary and avoided a runoff. She went on to win the general election and succeeded Deutsch in Florida's House of Representatives. At the age of 26, she became the youngest female legislator in Florida's history.
She served in the Florida State House of Representatives for eight years. State term limits required Schultz to leave the House. In addition to her work as a state legislator, she became an adjunct instructor of political science at Broward Community College. She also worked as a public policy curriculum specialist at Nova Southeastern University. She was elected to the Florida State Senate in 2000. She was considered one of the most liberal members of Florida's state legislature. She supported legislation requiring gender price parity for dry cleaning. She supported bills to require that an equal number of men and women were appointed to state boards. She pushed through several bills including the Florida Residential Swimming Pool Safety Act and one creating a Children's Services Council for Broward County. The Save The Manatee Club gave Schultz an award for her work in the state senate to protect manatees.
She serves on the following committees:
She is Chief Deputy Whip for the House Democrats. Schultz is a member of the New Democrat Coalition.
Schultz was appointed to the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee in her first term in Congress. During the 2006 elections, she raised over seventeen million dollars in campaign contributions for her Democratic colleagues. The only two congressmen to raise more money that year were Nancy Pelosi and Rahm Emanuel. Democrats in the House of Representatives chose her to be Chief Deputy Whip. They appointed her to the Appropriations Committee. (This was a very good job for a congresswoman with only two years of experience.)
She is a member of Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's "30 Something" Working Group, which consists of congressional Democrats under age 40. The group concentrates on issues affecting young people, including Social Security. She also has joined the bipartisan Congressional Cuba Democracy Caucus. According to the "Congress.org" 2008 Power Rankings, she was the 24th most powerful member of the House and 22nd most powerful Democratic representative (also most powerful Florida representative).
In April 2011, Tim Kaine resigned as Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman in order to run for the United States Senate. On April 5, 2011, President Barack Obama chose Schultz to succeed Kaine as the 52nd Chairman of the DNC. Between Kaine's resignation and the next DNC meeting, current DNC Vice-Chair Donna Brazile served as the interim Chair of the Democratic National Committee. On May 4, 2011, the DNC met and elected Schultz as its chair. Schultz became the third female DNC chief in history and the first in over 15 years.
On July 24, 2016, it was announced that she would resign her position as chairperson of the Democratic National Committee following the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Leaked emails provided by WikiLeaks showed Schultz and other members of the DNC staff mocking and attempting to sabotage the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders in favor of Clinton's campaign. 
The Clinton campaign announced the same day that Wasserman Schultz would act as honorary chair of an effort to elect Democrats across the United States in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. 
Schultz currently lives in Weston outside Fort Lauderdale. She has three children and is married to Steve Schultz. She is an active member of the National Jewish Democratic Council, Planned Parenthood and Hadassah.
In March 2009, she said that she went through seven surgeries related to breast cancer in 2008, while remaining a member of the House. That year, she promoted efforts for early screening for breast cancer.

Midnight

The time 12:00 at night, or 24:00 is called midnight. On computer clocks, the day changes to the next day the minute after midnight.
Solar midnight is the opposite of solar noon, which is when the sun is highest in the sky
In the world, midnight is the start of one day and the end of the last day. It's the dividing point between two days.
In the United States and Canada, digital clocks and computers usually show 12 a.m. right at midnight. However, people have to remember that any time is actually an instant. The "a.m." shown on clock displays means the 12-hour period after the instant of midnight. So when a clock says "12:00 a.m.", midnight has already passed and a new day has started. In other words, 11:59 p.m. shows until midnight; at the instant of midnight, it changes to 12:00. At the same time, the p.m. changes to a.m., but a.m. does not mean the instant of midnight which separates p.m. and a.m.

Rottnest Island

Rottnest Island (also known as Rotto or just Rottnest) is 18 kilometres from the mainland of Western Australia. It is called Wadjemup by the Noongar tribe, which means "land across the water". Rottnest is a popular tourist attaction.
Aboriginal people originally occupied Rottnest around 30,000 years ago. The island was originally connected to the mainland, but it eventually became separated with the Indian Ocean, and so it became an island. As Aboriginal people did not have boats, the island had no one living on it until the Europeans arrived. Dutch sailor Willem de Vlamingh named the island "Rattenest", meaning "Rat's nest". The 'rats' he was referring to was actually a Quokka, a native animal on the island. 
After the Swan River Colony was established in 1830, Robert Thomson settled on the island with his family. He made a living selling salt, which is naturally found on the island. Before refrigeration, salt was very important, as it kept food fresh.
The island became a prison for Aboriginals, during the periods of 1838-1849 and 1855-1931. Around 3,700 Aboriginal men and boys were imprisoned for crimes such as spearing livestock, burning the bush and digging vegetables.
Rottnest Island was also used during World War I and II. 
Rottnest is home to the Quokka, and is one of the few places in the world where they live.
Rottnest Island is now a very popular tourist destination, due to its beaches, wildlife and natural environment. Nearly 500,000 people visit the island each year, mostly by ferry but others by aircraft (Rottnest has its own airport). The island is looked after by the Rottnest Island Authority (RIA). A fee is charged when people enter the island, which goes to help maintain it.
Motor vehicles are prohibited on the island, except for use by the RIA, Police or other emergency services. Additionally, only certain individuals are allowed to permanently live on the island.

International Ice Hockey Federation

The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) ("French": "Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace") is the worldwide governing body for ice hockey and in-line hockey. It is based in Zurich, Switzerland, and has 70 members. It is responsible for the management of international ice hockey tournaments, and maintains the IIHF World Ranking.
Despite its worldwide authority, the IIHF has little control of hockey in North America, where the National Hockey League (NHL) is the highest hockey organization. Its base of power rests in Europe with the respective national governing bodies and leagues. Canada (Hockey Canada) and the United States (USA Hockey) are the only members who have their own rulebooks.
Decisions of the IIHF can be appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.
The IIHF museum was located within the International Hockey Hall of Fame Museum located in Kingston, Ontario from 1992 to 1997. After terminating the partnership with the International Hockey Hall of Fame, the IIHF signed an agreement with the NHL to house their museum within the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1998, the IIHF museum relocated to Toronto, Ontario, occupying over within the Hockey Hall of Fame.
As part of the centennial celebrations of the IIHF's founding, the 2008 IIHF World Championship was held in Canada, the perennial leaders of the sport. This was the first time the championships were hosted in Canada. Russia went on to win the 2008 Championship.
The main functions of the IIHF are to govern, develop and organize hockey throughout the world. Also to promote friendly relations among the member national associations and to operate in an organized manner for the good order of the sport.
The federation may take the necessary measures in order to conduct itself and its affairs in accordance with its statutes, bylaws and regulations as well as in holding a clear jurisdiction in what concerns to ice hockey and in-line hockey at the international level. The IIHF is the body responsible with arranging the sponsorships, license rights, advertising and merchandising in connection with all IIHF competitions.
Another purpose of the federation is to provide aid in the young players' development and in the development of coaches and game officials. On the other hand, all the events of IIHF are organized by the federation along with establishing and maintaining contact with any other sport federations or sport groups. The IIHF is responsible for processing the international players' transfers. It is also the body that presides over ice hockey in the Olympic Games as well as over all levels of the IIHF World Championships. The federation works in collaboration with local committees when organizing its 25 World Championships, at five different categories.
Even though the IIHF runs the world championships, it is also responsible for the organization of several European club competitions such as the Champions Hockey League or the Continental Cup. With its 100 anniversary, the federation launched a new annual club competition in 2008, the Victoria Cup, named after the Montreal Victoria Skating Rink, the site of the first organized indoor ice hockey match.
The federation is governed by the legislative body of the IIHF which is the General Congress along with the executive body, which is the Council. The Congress is entitled to make decisions with regard of the game's rules, the statutes and bylaws in the name of the federation. It is also the body that elects the president and the council or otherwise known as board.
The president of the IIHF is basically the representative of the federation. He represents the federation's interests I all external matters and he is also responsible that the decisions are made according to the federation's statues and regulations. The president is assisted by the General Secretary who is also the highest ranked employee of the IIHF.
The International Ice Hockey Federation was founded on May 15, 1908 at 34 Rue de Provence in Paris, France, as Ligue International de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG). The founders of the federation were representatives from Belgium, France, Great Britain, Switzerland and Bohemia (now Czech republic). Louis Magnus, the French representative, was the fifth member to sign the founding document and also the first president of the LIGH. A year later, the first congress was held in Paris and then another one during the same year in Chamonix, France.
The Federation has 51 full members: Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Chinese Taipei, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, DPR Korea, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Mongolia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and United States. Full members have a national body dedicated to the sport, and participate annually in the international championships. Only full members have voting rights.
In addition, there are 16 associate members and 3 affiliate members.
Associate members either do not have a national body dedicated to the sport, or do not regularly participate in the international championships. They are Andorra, Armenia, Brazil, Georgia, Greece, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Liechtenstein, Macau, Macedonia, Malaysia, Moldova, Morocco, Portugal, Singapore and United Arab Emirates.
Affiliate members participate only in the inline championships. They are Argentina, Chile and Namibia.

Strudel is made of a thin, elastic pastry. The filling contains sliced apples, sugar, cinnamon, raisins, and bread crumbs. Preparing the strudel dough is a difficult process, so you can also buy strudel pastry. Apple strudel can also be made with puff pastry. Traditionally, the strudel is served warm with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Also, vanilla sauce is popular in many countries.

Ostreidae are the true oysters. The family includes most species eaten under the name "oyster". Pearl oysters are not true oysters because they belong to a different order, the Pterioida.
Like scallops, true oysters have a central adductor muscle. This causes a scar in the middle of the shell. It is the point of attachment. The shell is often irregular because oysters attach to substrates.

Lens (eye)

The crystalline lens is a transparent, biconvex structure in the eye. With the cornea it helps to refract light to be focused on the retina. The lens changes shape. This changes the focal distance of the eye so that it can focus on objects at various distances. This adjustment of the lens is called accommodation. It is similar to the focusing of a photographic camera when it focuses its lenses. The lens is flatter on the inside.
The lens is also called the "aquula" (Latin, "a little stream", dim. of "aqua", "water") or "crystalline lens". In humans, the refractive power of the lens in its natural environment is approximately 18 dioptres. This is about one-third of the eye's total power.

Lake Ülemiste

Lake Ülemiste () a lake in Estonia. It is the largest of the lakes near Tallinn, the capital city. Tallinn takes its drinking water from this lake. The lake gets its water mostly from the small Kurna stream and the larger Pirita River (through the Vaskjala-Ülemiste canal).
There is a legend about this lake. The legend says that the "Old Man of Lake Ülemiste" () lives in the lake. When anyone meets him, he always asks: "Is Tallinn ready yet?". If the other person answers "Yes, the city is ready.", then the old man will send the lake waters out to cover the city of Tallinn. In this way, if anyone meets this old man, they should answer: "No, the city is not ready. There is a lot of work to do still." In this way the city can be saved.

Sachertorte

The Sachertorte (Sacher cake) is a chocolate cake with a chocolate icing and a apricot jam filling. It is a typical sweet from Vienna. It is named after Franz Sacher, who invented the recipe.
The first cake was made by Franz Sacher in 1832 when Klemens Fürst Metternich ordered the kitchen to create a new sweet for his evening guests. The chef was ill so Sacher, who was apprentice in his second year, invented the first Sachertorte. After this the cake was nearly forgotten. Sacher worked in Budapest and Presburg and opened in 1848 a high-class delicatessen and winery in Vienna. His son Eduard Sacher, who learned in the Demel bakery which supplyed the court, brought the recipe in the form we know today. First the cake was sold by Demel, but after Eduard bought the Hotel Sacher also there.
In the 20th century there was a legal battle between the Sacher and the Demel about selling the "Original Sacher Torte". In 1963 the both parties agree, that the Hotel Sacher is allowed to use the name "Original Sacher Torte". The Demel could now sell a "Eduard Sacher Torte".
The Sachertorte consists of a chocolate sponge cake with a thin layer of apricot jam in the middle and dark chocolate icing on the top and sides. The main difference between the cake from the Hotel Sacher and from the Demel bakery is that the Original Sacher Torte has a layer of apricot jam under the icing and in the middle of the cake. The cake from Demel has only jam under the icing.
You can buy the "Original Sacher Torte" only at the Vienna and Salzburg locations of the Hotel Sacher, at the Cafes Sacher in Innsbruck and Graz, at the Sacher Shop in Bozen, in the Duty Free area of the Vienna airport and via the web at the Hotel Sacher's online shop. The recipe is a secret but it is known that the icing consists of three different types of choclate which are produced exclusively by different producers for this single purpose.
Most of the time the cake is served with whipped cream without sugar.

Salzburger Nockerl

Salzburger Nockerl is a sweet dessert from Salzburg, Austria.
The dessert is made of egg yolk, flour, sugar, salt, vanilla, and milk mixed into a thin dough. It is always freshly prepared. It is served warm with powdered sugar on it. The powdered sugar is said to represent the snow-covered peaks of the Gaisberg, Moenchsberg and Nonnberg.
In the operetta "Saison in Salzburg" (Season in Salzburg) by Fred Raymond, the dessert is praised in a song as "“Suess wie die Liebe und zart wie ein Kuss” (meaning Sweet as love and tender as a kiss in German). A legend says that they were invented by Salome Alt, the concubine of Salzburg′s Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau in the early 17th century.

Thermochemistry

Thermochemistry is the study of the energy and heat to do with chemical reactions and physical transformations (physical changes). Physical transformations are when a state of matter (a solid or liquid, for example) changes to another state. Examples of transformations include melting (when a solid becomes a liquid) and boiling (when a liquid becomes a gas).
A reaction gives out or takes in energy. A physical transformation also gives out or takes in energy. Thermochemistry looks at these energy changes, particularly on a system's energy exchange with its surroundings. Thermochemistry is useful in predicting reactant and product quantities at all times during a given reaction. Thermochemists do this by using data, including entropy determinations. Thermochemists will tell if a reaction is spontaneous or non-spontaneous, favorable or unfavorable. 
Endothermic reactions take in heat. Exothermic reactions give out heat. Thermochemistry combines the concepts of thermodynamics with the idea of energy in the form of chemical bonds. It includes calculations of such quantities as heat capacity, heat of combustion, heat of formation, enthalpy, entropy, free energy, and calories.
Thermochemistry started with two ideas:
These discoveries came before the first law of thermodynamics (1845). They helped scientists understand this law.
Edward Diaz and Hess investigated specific heat and latent heat. Joseph Black developed the concept of latent energy changes.
Gustav Kirchhoff showed in 1858 that change in the heat of reaction is given by the difference in heat capacity between products and reactants: <math>

Kurt Schuschnigg

Kurt Alois Josef Johann Schuschnigg (1897–1977, until 1919, "Edler von Schuschnigg") was the 15th Chancellor of Austria. He was in office between the assassination of his predecessor, Engelbert Dollfuss in 1934, and the annexation of Austria in 1938. The time of Dollfuss' and Schuschnigg's reign is known as Austrofascism today. He survived the war as a prisoner. After the war, he took US citizenship, and became a professor for state law in the United States. In 1968, he returned to Austria, where he died in 1977. 
Schuschnigg studied law in Freiburg im Breisgau and Innsbruck. The nazi Otto Planetta killed Dollfuss, in 1934, in an event that is known as July putsch today. During the war, the NSDAP saw Planetta as a hero. Schuschnigg became the next Chancellor, and at age 36, is the youngest person to become chanellor to this date. 
Schuschnigg was a conservative and an Austrian nationalist. He also supported the idea of Austria as a catholic nation. During his time in office, he was opposed to the idea of Austria becoming a part of Germany. Adolf Hitler began to make show aggression towards Austria in the later 1930s. Schuschnigg planned a referendum on the issue, and this was strongly opposed by the Nazis. In his last major speech, he gave an emotional appeal to Austrian independence and nationalism, finishing with the line "Red White Red, until we're dead!" (referring to the colors of the Austrian flag). Schuschnigg was forced to step down on 11th March 1938, and to hand power to Dr. Arthur Seyß-Inquart. One day later, Austria was annexed to Germany. 
Schuschnigg was arrested by the Gestapo soon after this. He was sent to the infamous Dachau Concentration Camp, where he spent most of the war. After Dachau was liberated by allied armed forces he moved to the United States. He wrote books on his political career and worked in academia in the US. In 1968 he retired from being a professor and retired to Austria, where he died of natural causes in 1977.

Diario Frontera

Diario Frontera is a Venezuelan regional newspaper, headquartered in Ejido, in the state of Mérida. Founded in 1978, its slogan is "El diario del occidente del país" (The Daily of the occident of the country).
The newspaper is distributed as standard colored format. It contains regional, national, and international news. It has two supplements, issued every Sunday: "Aquí entre Nos" magazine, and a supplement for children, "Chipilín". It has special editions for occasions like "Feria del Sol" and "Día del Trabajador".
"Diario Frontera" was founded by José Benedicto Monsalve, along with the writer Rafael Ángel Gallegos, who was the first director, on 12 August 1978. At the beginning, it was printed in black and white using a rotary owned by "Diario Critica".
In the eighties, "Diario Frontera" became a generalist newspaper, printed in black and white, and with 20 pages. Since 1989, it has printed a page or a section dedicated to the University of the Andes, due to the great amount of students and the importance of the University in the life of the city.
In June 2005, it printed an inquiry about a student of the university killed by the police. "Diario" wrote that the student had been hit by the policemen, but also revealed his belonging to an armed political group. The headquarter of the newspaper was attacked by groups of students; it was the beginning of riots that then spread all over the city. The pleas of Reporters Without Borders remained unheard.
In 2008, on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary, "Diario" has revamped graphics (logo, typeface).

Charles Doolittle Walcott

Charles Doolittle Walcott (March 31, 1850 – February 9, 1927) was an American geologist and invertebrate paleontologist. He became known for his discovery in 1909 of well-preserved fossils in the Burgess Shale of British Columbia, Canada.
Walcott became Director of the U.S. Geological Survey 1894–1907, and Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 1907–1927. He discovered a number of important fossil sites. At the Walcott Quarry, the lowest (earliest) of the Burgess Shale deposits, Walcott collected 65,000 specimens between 1910 and 1924. The site dates to the Middle Cambrian, and is in the Canadian Rockies.
The Walcott-Rust quarry is near Russia, New York. This site has produced some of the best preserved trilobites ever found, including enrolled specimens with soft body parts.

Hydrography is divided into two basins of the Orinoco River (Atlantic) and Lake Maracaibo (Caribbean Sea): In the Orinoco River basin major rivers are: Santo Domingo, Canaguá, Escagüey, Ticopoto, Bumbúm and Carapo; in the In the Lake Maracaibo basin major rivers are: Chama, Motatán, Mucujepe, Capaz, Torondoy, Mocotíes and Nuestra Señora.
In the state there are a lot of gaps between them are: La Mucuy, Los Patos, Negra, Mucubaji, Santo Cristo, El Arco, Los Anteojos, Suero, Encierro, La Sangre, El Gallo, Don Pedro, Laguna Grande, campanario, La Honda, La Negra, Fría y La Carbonera. Other gaps: Laguna Brava, Los Lirios and Urao 
The climate is cold but in the relatively small area of Mérida state, there are usually several dramatic climatic changes that occur daily. The climate in Mérida city is between 19 °C and 20 °C, temperatures between 5 °C and 9 °C at El Bolivar Peak, or below zero when it snows and 28 °C in the El Vigía area. Its rains almost every late afternoon in January–February that is the coldest months an August–September and in August and September it often rains at night. The vegetation is exuberant and there are many lakes and rivers, a great number of which are well stocked with trout, one of the delicacies of Mérida. The most important river in the state is the "Chama" because a large part of the water resources of Venezuela originates in the Mérida mountains. The state tree is the "Bucare" and the state flower is the "Frailejón" and in the "Coloradito" is found the tree at the highest altitude in the world. In this mountains habitat the "Oso Frontino" bear and the majestic Condor flies through the skies of the páramos and in the lagoons there are many trout.

Microsoft Agent

Microsoft Agent is the technology created by Microsoft which uses animated characters Text to speech engines, and Speech recognition software to improve interaction with computer users. It comes pre-installed with Windows 2000 through to Windows Vista but not on Windows 7.
Microsoft Agent characters are stored in files of the .ACS file format, and can be stored in a number of compressed .ACF files for better World Wide Web distribution. Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft Bob Actor characters are stored in files of the .ACT format.
The speech engine itself is driven by the Microsoft Speech API (SAPI), version 4 and above. Microsoft SAPI provides a control panel for easily installing and switching between various available Text to Speech and Speech to Text engines, as well as voice training and scoring systems to improve the quality and accuracy of both engines.
Microsoft provides four agent characters for free, which can be downloaded from the Microsoft Agent website. These are called Peedy, Merlin, Genie, and Robby. Some characters also shipped with Microsoft Office up to version 2003 as the Office Assistants and with Windows XP as search assistants. New Agent characters can also be created using Microsoft's development tools, including the Agent Character Editor. Agents can be embedded in software with Visual Basic for Applications and in web pages with VBScript, and automated tools for the purpose of simplifying this exist. However, web page agents are only compatible with Internet Explorer, since alternative browsers like Opera or Mozilla Firefox do not support ActiveX. Additionally, users of Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and above or owners of Microsoft Office 2000 and up are the only ones who have Agent software pre-loaded on their computers; others have to download the software and install it manually.

Keble College, Oxford

Keble College is one of the colleges of the University of Oxford in England. Its main buildings are on Parks Road, opposite the University Museum and the University Parks. Keble is one of the larger colleges, with 435 undergraduates and 245 graduate students. The head of the college is the Warden (currently Sir Jonathan Phillips) and senior academic members are Fellows.
Keble was founded in 1870, having been built as a monument to John Keble, a leading member of the Oxford Movement. As originally constituted it was for men only and the fellows were mostly bachelors resident in the college. In the period after the second World War the trends were towards scientific courses (the major area devoted to science east of the University Museum influenced this) and eventually co-education for men and women from 1979 onwards.
It remains distinctive for its once-controversial neo-gothic red-brick buildings designed by William Butterfield. During the 20th century the college has been extended several times by new buildings.

I would like to create an alternative account. I believe I can assure everyone that it is for a legitimate purpose, but it doesn't quite fit neatly under the .
Background: I recently did a presentation about SEWP at a teaching conference. There was lots of interest, but the room did not allow a hands-on workshop, so few people actually went ahead on their own later and tried it. I may have a chance to do some workshops in computer rooms with teachers in the future.
I'd like to create a separate account for demonstration purposes: show relatively non-techie language teachers how to create an account, user page, talk page, history, make a few edits, etc. To really make a good demo, I kind of need to start from scratch. I hope that would be fine. There are two issues I see already. One, at times I would like to use my current account and the demo account at the same time to show how to use Talk, undo others edits, etc. Also, if possible, I'd like to not put a huge notice on the alternate account userpage with a lot of bureacratese or technical Wikipedia jargon. That kind of thing can really put off new users and non-techies. If one of the first things they see is "This is not a sockpuppet", some are likely to lose interest. I'd like to keep it minimal, like "This account is also used by Gotanda for teaching purposes." I could put a more substantial notice on my main user page. I could also notify admins in advance if I planned to use both accounts simultaneously. This would happen quite rarely-a few times per year at most.

Hello, I created an account for a bot that I was GOING to request approval for, but I aborted it. The account is , and I was going to run it on Pywikipedia. However, I ran into some installation problems, so I am not going to make a bot after all. I deleted Python and all related files from my computer, so the bot is basically just an unused account that does absolutely nothing. The reason I brought it here was because I didn't want anyone to think that I was running an un-approved bot. Heck, you can even re-name it, block it or just delete it. I couldn't care less, to be honest. Thanks, 14:47, 18 October 2011 (UTC)

I have been trying to make sure that all templates have appropriate categories. For protected templates, I can take care of them if they use documentation subpages, but I need help with those that don't. I'd like to request the following:
Add codice_1 to the end of these
Change codice_1 to codice_1 to make it easier to work with these
Unprotect these; they are subpages and shouldn't need protection
Move documentation off of template and onto doc subpage; add codice_1 to end of template. ("Documentation" would include categories, interwikis, and information about the template and how to use it.) If desired, I could create doc subpages and put what the changed templates should look like in each template's sandbox, and all I'd need help with is replacing each template with the contents of the sandboxes (except you'd need to keep the protection template on the template page).

Arrows

"This article is about the Formula One racing team. For other uses of the term "arrow," see Arrow.
Arrows Grand Prix International was a Formula One team active from 1978 to 2002. The team was also known as Footwork.
The Arrows Grand Prix International team was founded in 1977, by Italian financier (someone who handles lots of money) Franco Ambrosio, Alan Rees, Jackie Oliver, Dave Wass and Tony Southgate when Rees, Oliver, Wass and Southgate left the Shadow team. They named the team after the first letter of each person's last name in order, spelling out AROWS. The name was then changed to the correct spelling of Arrows.
The team earned their first podium at the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix, with future Williams driver Riccardo Patrese earning second. The rest of the season consisted of him earning points occasionally. Arrows fielded Patrese until 1981. In 1984 the team used BMW M12 turbo engines, and later Megatron turbos, and results improved as the turbo era moved along, going at its peak in 1988 when the team finished fifth in the constructors' championship. In between 1984 and 1988 the team had gotten two podium positions. Eventually when turbo engines were banned from the regulations, making them illegal to run in a race, Arrows' performance dropped, despite a third place podium finish at the 1989 USA Grand Prix in Phoenix.
The team was renamed Footwork in 1991 until being changed back to Arrows after the 1996 season. Arrows' performance dropped with the usage of the Porsche engines. Footwork eventually changed to Mugen Honda engines. The team also ran Ford and Hart engines as well.
In 1997, Tom Walkenshaw bought a part of Arrows, and hired 1996 Drivers' Champion Damon Hill and Pedro Diniz. Diniz was very rich and helped pay for Hill's salary, placing Diniz as the role of a pay driver. Hill nearly won the Hungarian Grand Prix but a component failure meant that Hill had slowed down and fell to second place, where Hill would finish. In the next few years Walkenshaw would buy out what Jackie Oliver had owned.
As the seasons went on Arrows started to go in debt. In 2002 at times the two drivers, Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Enrique Bernoldi deliberately failed to qualify for a couple of races in an attempt to save some money. The team could not finish the season and went into liquidation and folded at the end of the season. However, Phoenix Finance purchased the team's assets and tried to enter in the 2003 season but was not allowed.

Bella Thorne

Annabella Avery "Bella" Thorne (born October 8, 1997) is an American actress, dancer, singer, and model. She started as a child model and actress who has appeared in more than 20 movies and television series and more than 60 commercials. She is best known for her role as the young dancer CeCe Jones on the Disney Channel series "Shake It Up!".
Bella Thorne was born on October 8, 1997 in Pembroke Pines, Florida. She is the youngest of four children. Her older siblings are Kaili (born in 1992), Dani (born in 1993), and Remy (born in 1995), who are also actors and models. When Thorne was growing up, Spanish was her first language, but she has forgotten it from not using it.
Thorne's first movie appearance was as a sidelines fan in the 2003 movie "Stuck on You", but she was not credited for it. Since then, she has appeared in movie and television projects including "Jimmy Kimmel Live!", "Entourage", "The O.C." (as a younger version of Taylor Townsend), the third-last episode of "October Road", and five episodes of "Dirty Sexy Money" (as Margaux Darling). In 2007, Thorne appeared as a young girl who saw visions in "The Seer".
In 2008, Thorne starred alongside Christian Slater and Taylor Lautner in the drama series "My Own Worst Enemy". She won a Young Artist's Award for her portrayal of the character Ruthy Spivey in this series. She then appeared in the ten-episode web series "Little Monk", which showed characters from the series "Monk" as children. In 2009, she played the antagonist in the horror movie "Forget Me Not".
In 2010, Thorne joined the cast of HBO's "Big Love" in its fourth season. She replaced Jolean Wejbe in the role of Bill Henrickson's daughter Tancy 'Teeny' Henrickson, even though she had actually auditioned for a different role. She also guest starred on "Wizards of Waverly Place", as Max's girlfriend Nancy Lukey. Thorne also took on a supporting role in the family drama "Raspberry Magic".
Thorne was also a child model. Since appearing in her first picture for a parenting magazine at the age of 6 weeks, Thorne has starred in television ad campaigns for Digital Light Processing, Publix, and KFC, and appeared in print ads for brands including Barbie, ALDO K!DS, JLO by Jennifer Lopez, Kaiya Eve Couture, LaSenza Girl, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, Guess?, Target, Justice and Mudd for Kohls. She also modelled for Sears Back to School. In an interview with Seventeen magazine, Thorne said that her appointment as the spokesperson for Texas Instruments was her big break. She also said that she has lost much more projects than she has booked and said that the support of her family helped her get over disappointments.
Thorne currently co-stars on the Disney Channel sitcom "Shake It Up!", (originally titled "Dance, Dance Chicago"). Thorne plays Cecelia "CeCe" Jones, a dancer who dreams of a career in the spotlight. While she had done a lot of work in television and movie, Thorne had no experience in professional dancing before being cast in this show. After signing onto the show in October 2009, she began taking three dance classes every night.
Thorne is from Pembroke Pines, Florida, but has been living with her family in California since early 2006. Her interests include dancing, playing soccer, spending time with her family and playing with her two dogs, six cats and a turtle. She also says that she collects hardcover books, listens to 80s music, and uses YouTube as a research tool for getting into character. Thorne is a strong supporter of the Humane Society, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and The Nomad Organization, which provides education, food and medical supplies to children in Africa.
Thorne lost her father to a vehicle accident in 2007.
Thorne was diagnosed with dyslexia in second grade. She is currently being home-schooled. She used to go to a public school, but was abused by other students. Thorne improved in her learning after attending a Sylvan Learning center and is currently reading and writing a grade ahead. Thorne also talked about her dyslexia in an April 2010 interview with American Cheerleader Magazine, and explained that she overcame her dyslexia by reading everything she could find, including the labels of cereal boxes.
Thorne is currently dating YouTuber Sam Pepper. In August 2016, Thorne came out as bisexual.

Burgenland

The Burgenland is one of the nine federal states of the Federal Republic of Austria. It is the youngest of the nine states and came to Austria after the First World War in 1921. The name Vierburgenland (Land of Four Castles) was created in 1919. It was derived from the name of the four vármegye of the Kingdom of Hungary (in German Komitate, 'counties') known in Hungarian as Pozsony, Moson, Sopron and Vas, or in German as Pressburg, Wieselburg, Ödenburg and Eisenburg. Because Pressburg was given to Czechoslovakia, the number was dropped. In 1922 the name was adopted by the province assembly.
Burgenland has an area of 3961.80 km². It is divided into 3 regions (districts):
Sometimes Mittelburgenland is seen as a part of southern Burgenland.
The highest point of the state is the Geschriebenstein at 884 m, the lowest point is near Apetlon at 114 m. Burgenland and Hungary share the Neusiedler See. Leitha, Pulka and Raab are important rivers.
Burgenland has Croatian (29,000 - 45,000) and Hungarian (5,000 - 15,000) populations. The Burgenland Croatian language is an 16th-century dialect which is different from standard Croatian. In former times there was also a Roma and Jewish population, but the Nazis destroyed them.
In 1043 a peace treaty between Henry III and King Samuel Aba of Hungary fixed the western border of the Kingdom of Hungary along the Leitha and Lafnitz rivers, among others. The territory of the present-day Burgenland became the western border-zone of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary until the 16th century. The majority of the population was Germanic. There was also immigration in the Middle Ages from the neighbouring Austria. During occupation of Hungary by the Ottoman Empire some parts of today's Burgenland stayed within Habsburg rule. After the Austro-Hungarian empire was formed in 1867 Burgenland was part of the Hungarian part of the monarchy. Because 74% of the inhabitants were of German origin the area came to the new formed Republic of Austria. In the time till the Second World War many people emigrated to the United States. It is said that Chicago is the largest town of the Burgenland.
During the Nazi occupation the state was part of Styria and Lower Danube. In addition to the oppression of the Jews, the ethnic groups Roma and Sinti also suffered under the Nazi regime. The Lackenbach concentration camp for Gypsies was in the area.
After the Second World War Burgenland was part of the Soviet occupation zone. After the Staatsvertrag it had a long border to the communist area in eastern Europe. The economic development was very slow. After joining the European Union this development became faster.
Burgenland's provincial assembly (Landtag) has 36 seats. The provincial government is a combination of Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) and the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP). The voting age for regional elections in Burgenland was reduced to 16 in 2003.
The area's main attractions are the Neusiedler See (the lake), the hot springs at Lutzmannsburg, Stegersbach and Bad Tatzmannsdorf. There is also over 500 km of bicycle tracks in Also.
There are several events in summer:

<doc id="305534" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305534" title="Organometallic chemistry">
Organometallic chemistry

Organometallic chemistry is the study of chemical compounds containing bonds between carbon and a metal. It combines aspects of inorganic chemistry (the study of non-carbon bonds) and organic chemistry (the study of carbon bonds).
Examples of organometallic compounds are tetraethyllead; it was used as a fuel (leaded gasoline) additive in the past. Also Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B) is a common organometallic compound.
Organometallic compounds are compounds that have chemical bonds between an one or more metal atoms and one or more carbon atoms of an organyl group (an organic ligand). They have the prefix "organo-" (for example, organopalladium compounds). Organometallic compounds include subgroups like the metalloproteins such as haemoglobin. 
The term "metalorganics" usually refers to metal-containing compounds lacking direct metal-carbon bonds but which contain organic ligands which bind them to an organic compound. Metal beta-diketonates, alkoxides, and dialkylamides are members of this class.
In addition to the traditional metals, elements such as boron, silicon, arsenic, and selenium form organometallic compounds.
Many complexes have coordination bonds between a metal and organic ligands. The organic ligands often bind the metal through a heteroatom such as oxygen or nitrogen, in which case such compounds are called "coordination compounds". 
Many organic coordination compounds occur in nature. For example, hemoglobin and myoglobin contain an iron center coordinated to the nitrogen atoms of a porphyrin ring; magnesium is the center of a chlorin ring in chlorophyll. The field of such inorganic compounds is known as bioinorganic chemistry. However, methylcobalamin (a form of Vitamin B), with a cobalt-methyl bond, is a true organometallic complex, one of the few known in biology. 
The metal-carbon bond in organometallic compounds is half way between being ionic and covalent. Organometallic compounds with bonds that have characters in between ionic and covalent are very important in industry. They are both relatively stable in solutions but ionic enough to undergo reactions. Two important classes are organolithium and Grignard reagents. 
Organometallics find practical uses in stoichiometric and catalytic processes, especially processes involving carbon monoxide and alkene-derived polymers. All the world's polyethylene and polypropylene are produced with organometallic catalysts. Acetic acid is produced using metal carbonyl catalysts in the Monsanto process and Cativa process. The bulk of the synthetic alcohols, at least those larger than ethanol, are produced by hydrogenation of hydroformylation-derived aldehydes. Similarly, the Wacker process is used in the oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde.
Organomettalic are highly basic and highly reducing. They catalyze many polymerization reactions. They are also useful stoichiometrically.
Organometallic compounds may be found in the environment. Environmentalists worry about organo-lead and organo-mercury compounds. They are toxic hazards.
Research is currently underway using organometallic catalysis. The energy crisis has initiated increased interest in more efficient ways of working with the remaining fossil fuels we have left. While many agree that lowering oil dependence is safer for the environment as well as politically wise. The new interest in “green” technologies has also helped increase research. Many examples of organometallic research can be found in the petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. Some current methods of chemical production are wasteful and produce toxic waste, while many organometallic catalysts show promise to change that.
Louis Claude Cadet synthesized methyl arsenic compounds related to cacodyl. William Christopher Zeise made platinum-ethylene complex. Edward Frankland discovered dimethyl zinc. Ludwig Mond discovered Ni(CO). Victor Grignard worked with organomagnesium compounds. The abundant and diverse products from coal and petroleum led to Ziegler-Natta, Fischer-Tropsch, hydroformylation catalysis which employ CO, H, and alkenes as feedstocks and ligands.
Years ago, Tetraethyllead was added to gasoline as an antiknock agent. Because lead is toxic, it is no longer used in gasoline. Instead, other organometallic compounds such as ferrocene and methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) are now added to gasoline to prevent knocking.
The 1973 Nobel Prizes to Ernst Fischer and Geoffrey Wilkinson for work on metallocenes made organometallic chemistry more popular. In 2005, Yves Chauvin, Robert H. Grubbs and Richard R. Schrock shared the Nobel Prize for metal-catalyzed olefin metathesis.

Coniston Water

Coniston Water (usually called just Coniston) is a lake in Cumbria. It is the third largest lake in the Lake District. It is long and wide. The lake has an elevation of 143 feet (44 m) above sea level. It drains to the sea via the River Crake.
In the 20th century Coniston was the scene of many attempts to break the world water speed record. On August 19, 1939 Sir Malcolm Campbell set the record at 141.74 miles per hour (228.108 km/h) in Bluebird K4. Between 1956 and 1959 Sir Malcolm's son Donald Campbell set four successive records on the lake in Bluebird K7, a hydroplane.
In 1966 Donald Campbell decided that he needed to get over 300 miles per hour (483 km/h) to keep the record. On January 4, 1967 he achieved a top speed of over 320 miles per hour (515 km/h) in Bluebird K7 on the return leg of a record-breaking attempt. He then lost control of Bluebird, which somersaulted and crashed, sinking rapidly. Campbell was killed instantly on impact. The attempt could not be counted as a record-breaking run because the second leg was not completed.
In recent times, Coniston Water has become known for a controversial murder case. Mrs Carol Park was dubbed the "Lady in the Lake" after the Raymond Chandler novel of the same name.

Delirium tremens

Delirium tremens (often called DTs or the DTs) is a medical emergency. It is the worst form of alcohol withdrawal, which can happen when a person who drinks a lot of alcohol suddenly stops drinking. "Delirium" means very bad confusion that comes on quickly; "tremens" means "shaking."
Scientists think the DTs happen because the autonomic nervous system gets too excited. It works too hard and will not shut off.
DTs were first described in 1813.
Most people who stop drinking alcohol do not get the DTs. But some people are more likely to get the DTs if they suddenly stop drinking. DTs are more likely in people who:
About 5% of people who have alcohol withdrawal symptoms get the DTs. About 5-10% of chronic (long-term) alcoholics get the DTs at some point in their life.
DTs cause symptoms that can be very bad and very dangerous. Even though not many people get DTs when they stop drinking, many people that do get DTs die from them. Others get permanent brain damage or other problems.
Symptoms usually start within 2 to 3 days after the person had their last drink. But in some people, DTs can happen up to a week or 10 days after their last drink.
Most people who die from DTs die from one or more of these symptoms:
Other body symptoms caused by DTs include:
DTs can cause changes to thinking and feelings that can be very scary for the patient:
DTs can cause major changes to the senses, especially what a person sees, hears, and feels. For example:
DTs always need to be treated in a hospital. If a person starts having symptoms of DTs at home, 9-1-1 (or their local emergency number) should be called for an ambulance right away.
Several types of medicines can be used to treat DTs:
People with DTs are also often given thiamine (vitamin B1), an important vitamin, because alcoholics often do not have enough thiamine. If thiamine levels are low enough, this can cause brain damage.

Darwinopterus

Darwinopterus (meaning "Darwin's wing") is a genus of pterosaur, discovered in China and named after Charles Darwin. It is the first known pterosaur to display features of both long-tailed (rhamphorhynchoid) and short-tailed (pterodactyloid) pterosaurs. "Darwinopterus" is a transitional fossil between the two groups. 
Between 30 and 40 fossil specimens have been found, all collected from the Tiaojishan Formation, which dates to the Middle Jurassic, 160 million years ago (mya). The type species, "D. modularis", was described in February 2010. 
Two additional species, "D. linglongtaensis" and "D. robustodens", were described from the same fossil beds in December 2010 and June 2011, respectively.
The specimens showed sexual dimorphism: the males had crests on their heads, and narrower hips than the females.
This genus, and its near relatives, show a combination of 'primitive' (basal) and 'advanced' (derived) pterosaurian features. This is characteristic of transitional fossils ('missing links'), and is called modular evolution or mosaic evolution.
"Darwinopterus" had long tails and other features of rhamphorhynchoids, they also had distinct pterodactyloid features, such as long vertebrae in the neck and a single skull opening in front of the eyes.
The specimen preserved along with an egg gave information on the reproductive strategies of "Darwinopterus" and pterosaurs in general. 
Like the eggs of later pterosaurs and modern reptiles, the eggs of "Darwinopterus" had a parchment-like, soft shell. In modern birds, the eggshell is hardened with calcium carbonate, completely shielding the embryo from the outside environment. Soft-shelled eggs are permeable to water, and allow significant amounts to be absorbed into the egg during development. Eggs of this type are more vulnerable to the elements and are typically buried in soil. 
David Unwin, a co-author of the paper, suggested that "Darwinopterus" probably laid many small eggs at a time and buried them. Juveniles could fly upon hatching, and required little to no parental care. 
These results imply that reproduction in pterosaurs was more like that in modern reptiles and significantly differed from reproduction in birds.

Transitional fossil

Transitional fossils (or missing links) are the fossilised remains of lifeforms that show features typical of two distinct groups. It may be a rare fossil, such as "Archaeopteryx", which shows early features of a group which later becomes widespread.
The rarity of transitional forms is interesting. It suggests the new forms are not yet dominant in the ecology of their time, and their populations are relatively small. It follows that their fossils would be scarce. In the Solnhofen limestone where "Archaeopteryx" was found, there are more examples of pterosaurs of several genera than there are of the proto-bird. In the Jurassic, the pterosaurs were dominant in the air. 
But in the Lower Cretaceous the situation is reversed. The pterosaurs are in decline, and large numbers of different bird species are found in the famous Chinese lagerstatten deposits such as the Jehol biota. The Lower Cretaceous birds are clearly more bird-like, and the features they developed evidently evidently enabled them to invade habitat niches which had been the preserve of pterosaurs, or maybe were not previously exploited at all.
Typical of transitional fossils is that some features are clearly basal or primitive. Other features are advanced ('derived'). With "Archaeopteryx", the front legs are derived, and show clearly the capacity for flight. Also, the feathers had the rachus (stem) off-centre, a feature of all bird flight feathers. The rest of the skeleton was just like any other small carnivorous dinosaur. 
When transition takes place between one group and another, not all features change at the same time. This is called mosaic evolution. Transitions between higher groups would involve a series of transitional species, only a few of which may be found as fossils.

Cornish cookery

Cornish cookery denotes the cooking styles, traditions and recipes associated with Cornwall. It has been heavily influenced by the geography of the county as well as its social history.
Being a peninsula, fish dishes form a major part of the historical and modern recipes in Cornwall, with the fishing industry playing a major part in its economy. The iconic dish of Cornwall, the pasty, has its roots in the mining industry. 
Cornwall's cookery has influenced and been influenced by other British cuisine, as well as having similarities with the cuisine of its neighbour, Devon.
Much of Cornwall's farming land is suitable for milk production and one of the by products is clotted cream (cream thickened by cooking). This forms the basis for many local specialities including Cornish fudge and Cornish ice cream and is used in Cornish cream teas. Cornish clotted cream is protected under EU law, and cannot be made anywhere else. 
Cornwall is perhaps best known for its pasties, a savoury baked dish made from pastry. Today's pasties usually contain a filling of beef steak, onion, potato and swede with salt and white pepper, but historically pasties had a variety of different fillings. Pasties are often locally referred to as "oggies".

I believe under the current quick deletion policy, admins are entitled to delete very short stubs, usually referred to as "one-liners". I propose this limit be raised, to anything which is three lines or less. By clicking "show any page" a few times, I came up with Uremia (I said so on IRC, WoO expanded it, kindly): it has been there for two years, was not correctly formatted or long enough, but still was included at SEWP in this sate (NVS added a template, so it is not as if nobody had seen it (no offense to him, many people, including my self, might have done the same and ignored the state in which it was)). Although it may be a notable subject, how does this help the encyclopedia's image? Say someone does the exact same thing as me, and clicks the "random page" button. What will he think, if one in five, one in four, one in three articles is only a few lines long? A non-formatted one-liner is not a sign of quality, even a "formated" two-liner is not, and that is not what we want to achieve; we can not accept to have so many very short articles. I am sure there are lots more. has over 10,000 articles in it, and I'm sure there are more which are not tagged. If anyone has a better solution, please, do not hold back. 22:03, 16 August 2011 (UTC)
I think that one of the problems is that too many editors spend too much time creating craptacular articles on not-particulary notable things (a problem we wouldn't have if we had agreed to stick to narrower perameters, as I had had urged). I think that common sense needs to be taken when considering of short pages. For example, Pasta and Pocatello, Idaho, keep; Red Bow Tie Pasta and Avoca, Iowa, throw. I am perfectly fine with craptacutular pages on nonimportant (i.e. they pass a notability guideline, but wouldn't be on a 10,000 or even 100,000 Meta articles list) being QDed, RFDed, or PRODded ≈≈≈≈ 03:55, 18 August 2011 (UTC)

Hello all,
The template is used to signal foreign characters in an article that are equivalent. That way, ß can be replaced by ss, ö by oe,ä by ae, and ü by ue, for the German language. The problem is that the template links the second name with the replaced character. In most cases, this will result in a link to the original article, as there should be a redirect. As this does not provide additional info, I think we should change the template to not link the second (target) name. Any thoughts? -- () 11:33, 20 August 2011 (UTC)

I'm sure I must be missing something simple, but I'm trying to find a list of all demoted GAs and VGAs. There are two reasons why. One, they may be easier to bring back to GA or VGA status and thus improve the appearance of the wiki. Two, and more important, I'm doing a presentation at a conference in September about Simple for a group of language teachers and want to make it very easy for them to find a wide range of "pretty good" articles. Yes, we have the current GAs and VGAs, but not enough of them. I figure any page that was once good enough to be V/GA is probably still reasonably good, or at least has some substantial content. It may have been demoted for lack of citations etc, but still be worth reading. If send them wading through the Demotions Archives, they'll lose interest. Any chance the former V/GAs are gathered or listed somewhere? Thanks, () 08:19, 26 August 2011 (UTC)

For 150 years, there has been a struggle for civil rights in the United States. This focused upon the rights denied and discrimination against people on the basis of race, religion, gender and national origin. It is a very complicated political, sociological, and legal area of research. On the English Wikipedia, there are articles with these current names and length in bytes:
It seems to me that rather than a very short stub for each of these, it would be better to summarize them all in an single Simple English article entitled "United States Civil Rights Movement." I would be willing to do that, but wanted to learn the consensus of the group before we start on such a task. Thanks, () 17:18, 29 August 2011 (UTC)

The discussion at seems to have dropped off. It is worth noting that Barras proposed a kind of compromise about half way through the comments. Maybe not everyone saw that.

Would it make sense to limit peer review nominations, DYK nominations, GA nominations, and VGA nominations to registered users? This would give IP users a reason to register. (See "Improving" above.) Thanks, () 11:49, 16 September 2011 (UTC)
I respect all of the above views and reasoning. The counter argument is that a signon develops a reputation and credibilty. One would hope that DYK, GA, VGA involve the nominator placing his credibility on the line. Hence, a signon would facilitate that role. I agree that Wikipedia should be something that anyone can edit, and that the anonymity of signons should be protected. But of coures, anyone can get a signon without revealing a real world identity. I will not press the point and we will see what happens in the ongoing IP nominated peer reviews. Thanks, () 03:59, 17 September 2011 (UTC)

Hi. :) I just wanted to let you all know that we are testing a new way for people to ask questions about the Wikimedia Foundation or ask for their help. If people like it and it helps, we'll keep it up. If not, we may stop using it.
You probably know already how the Wikimedia Foundation works, but in case you don't I want to let you know that they don't control Simple English Wikipedia or any other project. They can't help people settle arguments here or help if you are here. If you find a software bug or want to ask for a software feature, you do that at ). These are questions about the Wikimedia Foundation itself or that only its can answer.
What happens to your question depends on what type of question it is. A lot of them will get answered for everyone to read at . (So far, we've answered questions about money and what staff members do.) Some of them may get sent to other people who work for the Wikimedia Foundation or answered in email. If it's the kind of question that regular volunteers should handle, you might be sent to them instead.
If you want to ask a question, send it to codice_1. The terms and more information are available at . Thanks! -- () 19:30, 29 September 2011 (UTC)

Hi everyone, I have a suggestion. Get rid of soft redirects. As I have been told multiple times, the Simple English Wikipedia is another Wikipedia in it's own right! The whole point in this wiki is to have the articles in Simple English. Soft redirects to the English Wikipedia defeat the purpose of this entire wiki. They are formally written and are not even close to simple. Pretty much all the pages with soft redirects are pages such as and . They should be written again here in simple form. The reason I haven't used my initiative and done it by myself is because I don't know if regular editors are permitted to make these pages... Other user's input on this suggestion would be appreciated. 15:40, 4 October 2011 (UTC)

The article on Josip Broz Tito is often the target of POV edits. There are some new IP edits today which I find a bit suspicious. There are citations to books on google, but the relevant page numbers are not available for viewing, and a couple where the content is available seem to be quite extreme. A "fact" template put on a sentence that Tito was a member of the NKVD was removed without evidence being provided. My quick internet search suggests this is a highly dubious claim.

Couple of comments from me. Most importantly, I'd actually oppose anything being done to the Main Page at the moment simply because content is getting ignored and it's yet another excuse to stop doing what we're here to do and for people to just comment on this or work on an MP instead. Not what we need right now when there are plenty of articles in the P(V)GA queues, one article up at PAD and DYK struggling once more. I'd also be opposed to using GAs on the Main Page simply because it will likely create confusion and is also not our 'best' content - VGAs are. GAs have never been intended for going on the front page and so may not be up to standard, and I doubt we have the time nor manpower to go through every single one to get it up to scratch that would be required. As for the actual mockup, it looks plain, bland and boring - not really inviting into the site. I'm still a fan of the current main page, and think it suits the site even more since Vector was made the default skin for all users. The mockup is - for my liking, at least - too MonoBookish, and that's something to leave behind if the WMF are wanting to give the place a new look. But just my 2p. 22:59, 6 October 2011 (UTC) 
I don't like the header alignment. I think it leaves a bit too much white to the right-hand-side. Maybe if you want to align the header like that, you could put in ? It will at least fill up some space... I agree with the change of colour and the removal of the borders, but maybe it makes it look a bit... Boring? That's all my input. 13:32, 9 October 2011 (UTC)

Hi, I just wanted to bring attention to the huge amount of copy-pasted articles here. The reason I am bringing this up is because today alone, I have QD'd about 5, 6, 7, which is not very good. The only way I can see of reducing these is maybe blocking users who repeatedly copy-paste articles, because if this continues, we run the risk of having the entire wiki deleted for basically being a copy of EN. Don't get me wrong, a vast majority of articles here "are" actually simple, but the amount of copy-pasted articles is a bit too high for my liking. 18:26, 9 October 2011 (UTC)

Complexity class

A Complexity class is a concept from theoretical computer science and mathematics: All problems that have the same complexity are in the same complexity class. This means, that for a given input, they need about the same amount of resources, such as compute time, or memory. The most often used models for complexity are time complexity, which measures the time needed to calculate a result, or space complexity, which looks at the amount of memory or storage needed. When talking about complexity classes, a "worst case scenario" is usually assumed.

Mariner 2 was a NASA spacecraft. It was the second spacecraft in the Mariner program. Mariner 2 was the first successful mission from Earth to another planet.
Mariner 2 was launched on August 27, 1962 aboard an Atlas-Agena B rocket at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The aim of the Mariner 2 mission was to fly-by the planet Venus and return information on the planet's atmosphere, magnetic field, charged particle environment, and mass. Mariner 2 was at its closest to Venus, at a distance of 34,773 km, on December 14, 1962. The spacecraft then went into orbit with the Sun on Secember 27, 1962, 105,464,560 km away. The last transmission from Mariner 2 was received on January 3, 1963. Mariner 2 is still orbiting around the Sun today.
The spacecraft's design was exactly the same as that of Mariner 1. Mariner 1 was the first spacecraft in the Mariner program, but it had to be destroyed shortly after launch because its trajectory was wrong.
The spacecraft found out that the surface temperature on Venus was at least 425 °C (797 °F), on both the day and night sides. It discovered that Venus rotates in the opposite direction from most planets in the Solar System. The spacecraft also found that the atmosphere of Venus is mostly of carbon dioxide and that there is a very high pressure at the planet's surface. Continuous cloud cover was detected but no magnetic field was, however. It also found that solar wind is continuous and that the density of cosmic dust between planets is much lower than it is near Earth.

<doc id="305685" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305685" title="Period 1 element">
Period 1 element

A period 1 element is an element in the first period (row) of the periodic table. The periodic table is arranged in rows to show repeating properties of the elements. When the atomic number increases, the element have different properties. A new row begins when chemical properties repeat. It means that elements in the same group have similar properties. The first period has less elements than any other periods in the periodic table. There are only two elements in the first period: hydrogen and helium. We can explain why "there is less elements in the first row" in modern theories of atomic structure. This is because in quantum physics, this period fills up the 1s orbital. Period 1 elements follows the duet rule, they only need two electrons to complete their valence shell. These elements can only hold two electrons, both in the 1s orbital. Therefore, period 1 can have only two elements.
As period 1 only has two elements, there are no remarkable periodic trends.
Although both hydrogen and helium are in the s-block, they do not behaves similarly to other s-block elements. There is argument over where these two elements should be placed in the periodic table.
The position of hydrogen is sometimes above lithium, sometimes above carbon, sometimes above fluorine, sometimes above both lithium and fluorine (appearing two times), or float above the other elements and not belongs to any group in the periodic table.
The position of helium is almost always above neon (which is in the p-block) in the periodic table because it is a noble gas. However, sometimes the position of it is above beryllium because they have similar electron configuration.
Hydrogen (symbol:H) is a chemical element. Its atomic number is 1. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen has no color, no smell and no taste. It belongs to nonmetal, and it is highly flammable. It is a diatomic gas with the molecular formula H. Its atomic mass is 1.00794 amu, making hydrogen the lightest element.
Hydrogen is the most abundant of the chemical elements. The abundance of hydrogen is roughly 75%. Stars in the main sequence are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state. However, there are less hydrogen on Earth. Therefore, hydrogen is industrially produced from hydrocarbons (e.g. methane). We use elemental hydrogen locally at the production site. The largest markets almost equally divided between fossil fuel upgrading, such as hydrocracking, and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. Hydrogen may be produced from water using the process of electrolysis, but this process is significantly more expensive commercially than hydrogen production from natural gas.
The most common naturally occurring isotope of hydrogen, known as protium, has a single proton and no neutrons. In ionic compounds, it can take on either a positive charge, becoming a cation composed of a bare proton, or a negative charge, becoming an anion known as a hydride. Hydrogen can form compounds with most elements and is present in water and most organic compounds. It plays a particularly important role in acid-base chemistry, in which many reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. As the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and spectrum of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.
The interactions of hydrogen with various metals are very important in metallurgy, as many metals can suffer hydrogen embrittlement, and in developing safe ways to store it for use as a fuel. Hydrogen is highly soluble in many compounds composed of rare earth metals and transition metals and can be dissolved in both crystalline and amorphous metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the metal crystal lattice.
Helium (He) is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert monatomic chemical element that heads the noble gas series in the periodic table and whose atomic number is 2. Its boiling and melting points are the lowest among the elements and it exists only as a gas except in extreme conditions.
Helium was discovered in 1868 by French astronomer Pierre Janssen, who first detected the substance as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in light from a solar eclipse. In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in the natural gas fields of the United States, which is by far the largest supplier of the gas. The substance is used in cryogenics, in deep-sea breathing systems, to cool superconducting magnets, in helium dating, for inflating balloons, for providing lift in airships, and as a protective gas for industrial uses such as arc welding and growing silicon wafers. Inhaling a small volume of the gas temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. The behavior of liquid helium-4's two fluid phases, helium I and helium II, is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics and the phenomenon of superfluidity in particular, and to those looking at the effects that temperatures near absolute zero have on matter, such as with superconductivity.
Helium is the second lightest element and is the second most abundant in the observable universe. Most helium was formed during the Big Bang, but new helium is being created as a result of the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars. On Earth, helium is relatively rare and is created by the natural decay of some radioactive elements because the alpha particles that are emitted consist of helium nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations of up to seven percent by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation.

2011 Virginia earthquake

The 2011 Virginia earthquake was a magnitude 5.8 (M) earthquake in the U.S. state of Virginia on August 23, 2011, at 1:51 PM EDT (17:51 UTC). The focus was northwest of Richmond and from the town of Mineral, Virginia. The earthquake was along the Spotsylvania Fault, an ancient fault line that now sits in the middle of the North American plate. Four aftershocks happened within twelve hours of the main earthquake. The aftershocks had magnitudes 2.8, 2.2, 4.2 and 3.4. About 35 hours after the main earthquake, a sixth aftershock of magnitude 4.5 occurred. As of August 30, there have been 19 aftershocks, most of them minor.
There are very few strong earthquakes east of the Rockies in the U.S. This was only the second magnitude 5.8 in the last last 114 years. The other was the 1944 quake on the NY-Ontario border.
Press reports show that the earthquake could be felt a long distance away from its center. To the south, the earthquake reached Atlanta, Georgia; and to the north, the earthquake reached Quebec City, Quebec. To the west, the earthquake reached Illinois and to the east, the earthquake reached Fredericton, New Brunswick. Damage was reported as far away as Burlington, New Jersey.
Many buildings in the eastern United States are not built strongly enough that earthquakes cannot damage them. In Washington, D.C., the White House, the Capitol building and other buildings were evacuated. In Arlington County, Virginia, a pipe in the Pentagon broke. The pipe flooded two corridors. The Pentagon used an emergency plan put into place after the September 11 attacks to evacuate. Other buildings were evacuated in Philadelphia, Boston and New York City.
Soon after the earthquake, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered airplanes to stop flying along the East Coast. The Air Traffic Control tower at John F. Kennedy International Airport was evacuated. Flights were late at several airports, including John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Dulles International Airport, and Philadelphia International Airport. At the National Airport, ceiling tiles in the airport terminal fell to the ground, and flights stopped. Washington Metro trains were delayed and run at reduced speeds of 15 miles per hour. This allowed engineers to see if the rails were damaged. Just after the earthquake, many people made cell phone calls. This tied up the AT&T and Verizon Wireless networks. People could not start phone calls for at least 20 minutes.
Buildings in the Washington, D.C. area were damaged, but not severely. The quake damaged three of the Washington National Cathedral's four pinnacles (corner spires) and cracked some of the Episcopal church's flying buttresses. However, buttresses that support the central tower, a prominent part of the city skyline, look normal. The National Park Service found cracks near the top of the Washington Monument. The monument is closed indefinitely. The earthquake knocked off four of the six spires atop the Washington D.C. Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The pieces fell to the ground along with several pieces of marble from the temple's outside wall.
The two nuclear reactors at the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station, from the epicenter, shut down automatically. 
Damage in the northeastern United States was minor. In New York state, Governor Andrew Cuomo said the State Office of Emergency Management had no reports of damage to buildings or infrastructure. There were some disruptions, including building evacuations and delays at airports. Amtrak trains arriving and departing from Penn Station were also delayed.
In New Jersey, the state Emergency Management office reported two gas leaks in Gloucester County, with no reports of injuries from either leak. Buildings such a the Temple B'nai Israel in Burlington and a home in Camden were damaged. Government buildings were evacuated, and city workers could go home.
In Boston, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency reported no injuries or damage. The U.S. District Court in South Boston was evacuated and the University of Massachusetts Boston cut summer classes short and sent all workers home early.
In West Virginia, the Kanawha County Courthouse, the West Virginia State Capitol campus, and several other buildings in downtown Charleston were evacuated. Kanawha County dispatchers received more than 350 calls in 45 minutes but there were no reports of damage to buildings and infrastructure other than minor plaster cracking in the old . Part of a chimney collapsed at the county courthouse in Philippi in Barbour County. The West Virginia Office of Miners' Health Safety and Training stated that West Virginia coal mines were safe following the tremors.
In Delaware, the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington and Family Court in Georgetown were evacuated. The press said that blocks fell to the street from the steeple of St. Thomas the Apostle Church. DelDOT crews were sent to all parts of the state to inspect many bridges and roadways including interstate highways and the Indian River Inlet Bridge.
In Pennsylvania, people were told to get out of office buildings in Philadelphia. People were also told to get out of the Bucks County Courthouse in Doylestown. Also, SEPTA Regional Rail trains could only go while tracks were checked for damage and PATCO Speedline trains were also stopped for a short time even though there was no damage. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation checked bridges for damage. There was no damage to the bridges over the Delaware River owned by the Delaware River Port Authority.
People in eastern Canada also felt the earthquake, mostly in Southern Ontario, as well as parts of Quebec and the Maritimes. A few buildings in Toronto were evacuated. No accidents or damage from the earthquake were reported in Canada.
According to Facebook, the word "earthquake" appeared in the status updates of 3 million users within four minutes of the quake. Twitter said users were sending up to 5,500 tweets per second. This rate of messages was faster than during the death of Osama bin Laden. It was almost the same rate as the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

Candidatus

Candidatus is a term in the taxonomy (scientific classification) of bacteria.
It is a label put before the name of a bacterium which cannot be grown on an agar plate or in any other bacteriology culture. An example would be ""Candidatus" Phytoplasma allocasuarinae". Candidatus status may be used when a species or genus is well studied but cannot be cultured. Nowadays much information is got by 16S ribosomal RNA sequence analysis.
For correct publication of a species, bacteria must be isolated, cultured, described, and deposited in a bacteriology culture collection. However, some bacteria require special tissue culture conditions and cannot be maintained in Bacteriology Culture Collections. This includes bacteria which live inside other organisms or cells. These include obligately intracellular pathogens and endosymbionts, insect symbionts, and populations from oceans or sludge. 
In 1994, Murray and Schleifer published a taxonomic note. They recommended that the new category of indefinite rank (Candidatus) be established for certain putative taxa that could not be described in sufficient detail to warrant establishment of a new taxon. It was also recommended that a Candidatus list should be established in the "International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology".
According to the "IRPCM Phytoplasma/Spiroplasma Working Team – Phytoplasma taxonomy group" the abbreviation for Candidatus should be Ca.

In 2006 the genome of one strain of "Ca." C. ruddi was sequenced at RIKEN in Japan and the University of Arizona. The genome is a circular chromosome of 159,662 base pairs and has a high coding density (97%) with many overlapping genes and reduced gene length. The number of predicted genes was 182, also the lowest on record (NCBI-Genome). Numerous genes considered essential for life seem to be missing, suggesting that the species may have achieved organelle-like status.
In comparison, "Mycoplasma genitalium", which has the smallest genome of any free-living organism, has a genome of 521 genes.

<doc id="305725" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305725" title="French Civil Aviation University">
French Civil Aviation University

The French Civil Aviation University (French: "École nationale de l'aviation civile"), also known as ENAC, is a French public aeronautical "grande école" created the 28th of August 1949 and located at Biscarosse, Carcassonne, Castelnaudary, Château-Arnoux-Saint-Auban, Grenoble, Melun, Montpellier, Muret, Saint-Yan and Toulouse, in France. It is member of the "Conférence des Grandes Écoles", University of Toulouse, Aerospace Valley and is one the fifth founder of France AEROTECH.
ENAC provides training in civil aeronautics. The university has around 25 courses, including aerospace engineers, technicians, Masters, "Mastères Spécialisés", airline pilots, air traffic controllers, managers and flight instructors.
Air travel grew rapidly in France after World War II. Safe air transport required staff trained specifically for this activity. It also required people in different sectors of the aviation world to work together and understand each other. That is why ENAC was started. Max Hymans, the secretary general of civil and commercial aviation was the chief organizer.
ENAC is created the 28th of August 1949 (Decree 49-1205) in Paris. The university was located at Orly, south of Paris. René Lemaire considers ENAC as "a university of aviation safety". This priority given to safety is natural for ENAC, being the first reason for the training of future technicians and future airmen in a single university.
A report of the "Inspection générale de l'aviation civile" said "It was in the minds of the creators of the univerisity, to develop between the crew and the ground staff a community of ideas, reciprocal knowledge, and esteem, that are essential for the teamwork required by air transport." Training courses were longer or shorter depending on specialty. 
The decree of the 13th of October 1959 announces the first partner of the university: Air France. It results in a sharing of tasks and establishes a recruitment for airline pilots students with no previous flight experience. Previously, on an experimental basis, the university welcomed in 1958 the first airline pilots students. The university trained them for the preparation of the Airline Transport Pilot Licence theory exam. As for the practical training in flight, it is done at the SEFA center of Saint-Yan, created in 1949, until the commercial pilot licence, and at the Air France school for the advanced training. ENAC, in addition to his official task related to the preparation of the Airline Transport Pilot Licence theory, has some tasks of theoretical training for pilots of various airlines. There is also the question of the financial aspect of the training for airline pilots in private airlines. This training, which the cost is not paid by the French state, is too expensive for airlines and students, particularly because of the flight training part. Private airlines decided to pay the cost, which makes possible the free education for student pilots.
Meanwhile, ENAC developed cooperation with the "École nationale de la météorologie" and promoted the training of this subject for air traffic controllers. After World War II, when civil aviation is developing, soldiers can help its expansion. A lot of pilots, but also radios, navigators and mechanics are coming from the army to airlines. ENAC starts to be part of this movement, and help the conversion of military aircrew. It is in this spirit that is signed the 9th of June 1951 a memorandum specifying its duties in the training of military pilots for civil aviation. The university is the general contractor of the operations and provides the theoretical training. The "Service de l'aviation légère et sportive" (SALS), under the decree of the 31th of March 1951, is providing for free the flight training for airline pilots candidates coming from the army.
From 1949 to 1959, the number of courses held increase from 6 to 64 and the number of students from 49 to 800. The causes of rapid development are multiple. There is no doubt that ENAC has benefited from the spectacular development of air transport in the postwar years. But it would not have taken such an advantage if its teachings were not good. Finally, one can not ignore the presence of a significant contingent of students from either foreign countries or - in even larger numbers - which territories would gain independence in the near future. In the early 1960s, the university is beginning to welcome its first students and trainees from foreign civil aviation authorities. Along with development, new courses are created regularly. This creation is often a direct result of an administrative decision, as it is the case when a new rating is introduced. Thus, in 1956 was created the navigation instructor rating, with the opening of the corresponding training. Sometimes a course is simply set to meet a need. The same year 1956, for example, is introduced a speaking techniques course for instructors. Still in 1956, appears the first engineering students called "civilians", that is to say, not officials. The openings of new training graduate courses, of course, is much less frequent than those of new continuous training, which occurs fairly regularly. In 1958, the airline pilots theoretical training course is starting.
Life at ENAC Orly is then punctuated by the yearly trip for all the students, undoubtedly one of the highlights of the studies. It has its share of unexpected, but its rites, as the reception in full uniform of the university officials and the students by local authorities, on arrival at a new location.
The years 1960 - 1975 are those of a transition during which two major events happens: the move to Toulouse in 1968 where is now located the main campus and the change in status of the university, from external department of the French civil aviation administration to a public Administration institution in 1970.
When it is created, the French Civil Aviation University is located on the close to Paris-Orly Airport. This location near the largest French airport offers many advantages :easy use of the airplanes for a lot of activities - navigation flights, promotional trips, ... and the proximity with many airlines and aircraft manufacturers or related to the aviation industry, whose managers are likely to be called for lectures, conferences, ...
However, the very rapid growth of traffic at Paris-Orly Airport brought disadvantages. The aircraft used by ENAC, to have to be used in heavy air traffic. In the mid-1950s the first projects to implement ENAC on a new location starts to born. All involve are close cities of Parisian airports. Decentralization was among the motives. The plans for ENAC in the very close to Paris are irremediably condemned, studies are moving towards farther locations. The potential locations are all part of a 150 km radius around Paris, among other Melun, Pontoise, Coulommiers, Étampes, Reims, Évreux, Chartres, Orleans, etc.. Meanwhile, a report dated the 20th of May 1959, lists the disadvantages of a location too far from Paris: difficulties of transporting personnel, the possible increase of duration of the courses, increased operating costs... It is in this context that René Lemaire analysis, in its report dated the 14th of June 1960, the possibility of a transfer to Toulouse. It is its aeronautical and university aspects that have made the choice for this city as a new location (Toulouse 1 University Capitole, created in 1229, is one of the oldest university in the world, the "École nationale supérieure d'ingénieurs de constructions aéronautiques" had settled in Toulouse since 1961 and the "École nationale supérieure de l'aéronautique et de l'espace" was going to move from Paris to the city). It is the 15th of June 1961 that the transfer of the university in Toulouse is validated by an official decision of Prime Minister Michel Debré. It is confirmed by his successor Georges Pompidou in a letter dated the 23th of July 1963.
It was in April 1966 that began the construction of new buildings on the campus of Rangueil. The project ends the 19th of August 1968 when the staff is invited to be at the university. The academic year starts the 16th of September 1968. 500 students are expected, including 325 who start their training. These are as follows: 15 air navigation engineering students, drawn largely from "École Polytechnique", 70 engineering students in air navigation from two-years studies after French Baccalaureate, 60 airline pilot students, 100 air traffic controllers students, 40 electronics students, 20 commercial pilot students and 20 flight dispatcher students.
Although it thought it is better not to decide about the status of ENAC before the university opened its doors to its new campus, the "Commission permanente" has taken into consideration the problem of an inadequate legal status . This problem is old : identified shortly after the creation of the university, he has resurfaced many times, as the inspection reports that relate to the management of the institution shown. ENAC is closely followed by its supervisory authority. Inspection reports are occurring at a rapid cadence, in average one every two years, sometimes more. The judgment focused on the management of the institution is sometimes severe. These same reports, in the mid-1950s, contest the existence of the university, which was not the case in the previous years. As an example, the report (confidential) of Brancourt Controller the 12th of March 1952, based on the organization and operation of ENAC. We learn that the university has "a lack of doctrine", that "there is a certain tension with the training center of Air France", and even that "ENAC is madness".
In reality, the weaknesses can be largely explained by the difficulties caused by the inadequacy between the status of ENAC and the nature of its business, which requires it to provide courses for students and trainees who are not all officials from its supervisory authority, or to use teaching staff from very different origin. The heavy process for allocating university budget is in trouble as soon as other types of income are reduced, such as non-public resources. This happens more in the years 1958-1964. In 1962, the management of ENAC is thinking about increasing tuition fees, courses prices and fees for customers outside from the French civil aviation authority. However, the status of the institution submits the necessary prices adjustments to an approval process so difficult that finally is blocked. That's why, another type of status, "public administrative institution", appears much more appropriate. The final decision is taken by Decree No. 70-347 of the 13th of April 1970, with application the 1st of January 1971. Become a public administrative institution, ENAC is endowed with a board of directors. René Lemaire is the first president.
From 1975 a new thing is starting. It consists of an increase of the proportion of engineering students called "civilians" in opposition to the "officials" (civil servants) engineering students. ENAC is becoming a major player in the training for aerospace industry (civilian personnel), while its primary goal was only the training of officials for "direction générale de l'aviation civile". It is true that the existence of students for the private sector is not new at the university : it was in 1956 that are trained the first of them. At the end of 1950s, however, this recruitment affects only a minority of students. It is primarily done to compensate the disadvantage which consists of the highly different number of students to work in the administration and to prevent the size of successive promotions with a too great difference. However, this second source tends to become more and more important, to finally become the first one. This results in an revision of the teachings. ENAC engineering education, particularly that of the specialty called "facilities" - it focuses on electronics - seduce the industrial sectors of electronics and information technology. Without having particularly desired, the university has progressively the role of a National University of Engineers.
Industry oriented university, research appeared in 1984, following the law on Higher education which provides that "engineering education [...] has a research activity, basic or applied," and is organized around four areas: electronics, automation, computer and air transport economy. The university then feels interest for future engineers to learn research methods: while the method of deductive reasoning, for a long time favored by teachers in the two-years studies after French high school diploma and universities, shows its limitations, the method of inductive reasoning, characteristic of research, appears progressively better adapted to the nature of functions performed by today's engineers. The most recent manifestation of the growing interest in research at ENAC is the creation of the air transport economics laboratory, which designation reflects the desire to study, in addition to air transport itself, certain related activities such as air navigation.
The mid 1980s saw the emergence of "mastères spécialisés" programs. They are born for most of them from an industrial demand, including the "groupement des industries françaises aéronautiques et spatiales", in order to support the export contracts by training. Indeed, while filling the needs of many French students or professionals, they can train in a relatively short period some foreign executives. The same period saw the diversification of continuing education at the university. The continuing education courses are organized in five main areas: air traffic systems, electronics, computer, aeronautics and languages/humanities.
The international dimension of the university grew in the 1990s. It is constrained, however, by the design and implementation of the new cycle for air traffic controllers. The effort required a specifically European component. It consists first in the participation in European projects such as EATCHIP (European Air Traffic control Harmonization and Integration Program), then in joining mobility programs for students such as Erasmus or Socrates. Under these programs, the university welcomes a growing number of foreign students. In doing so, it forges close relations with foreign universities, including those of Berlin and Darmstadt in Germany, as well as the one of Tampere in Finland. Since 1990, the university has new missions. Thus, ENAC negotiates new contracts for studies and research abroad. The 2000s are the years of the creation of courses entirely taught in English language and the development of activities focused on air navigation. In 2009, the university and its alumni association organize the first edition of the "salon du livre aéronautique" (aeronautical literary festival) in Toulouse. In December 2010, ENAC becomes an ICAO center for training in aviation security.
Meanwhile, the university develops new teaching facilities: the air traffic control simulator "CAUTRA", the aerodrome control simulator "AERSIM", an Airbus A320 flight management system simulator, a static model of the Airbus A321' s engine and the laboratory of telecom networks.
Since the 1st January 2011 and the merging of ENAC with the SEFA, the university is the biggest European aviation university.
The current head of the university is Marc Houalla, who was SEFA director from 2006 till the 1th of January 2011. It is the seventh person to be director since 1949. He was elected in 2008 after the departure of Gérard Rozenknop, his predecessor. The directors since 1949 are given in the following table.
As all the equivalent universities in France, ENAC is managed by a President elected by a board of directors. He is member of the three councils of the university :
In addition to these three councils, the university has a director's office which includes communication and cultural affairs, a division of information systems and a general secretariat dedicated to legal management, logistics, financial and human resources.
The university has spent for its operation 126 million euros in 2011. The budget is up 61.12% compared to 2010 as a result of its merger with the SEFA and consists of:
In consideration for several months, a corporate foundation has been established in September 2011. It aims to guide the training and research council on the changes to be made to the training "Ingénieur ENAC" (ENAC engineer) and to the corporate partnerships.
It consists of technical and human resources managers from aerospace companies such as Air France, Airbus, Aéroport de Paris, Rockwell Collins, Thalès, "Aéroconseil"...
ENAC has eight campuses and can provide accommodation. It also has a canteen, cafeteria, library, computer rooms, sports halls including a fitness room, a sports field, a rugby field, five tennis courts, a beach volleyball and a golf driving range. Its main campus is located at Rangueil (Toulouse).
Since its merger with the SEFA, ENAC has eight locations :
ENAC has a fleet of 130 aircraft of different types: CAP-10, Socata TB-10, Socata TB-20, Beechcraft Baron 58, Beechcraft 200, ATR 42, Diamond DA40 (to replace the Socata TB-20) and Diamond DA42 (to replace the Beechcraft Baron 58).
On its Toulouse campus, the university has flight simulator Robin DR400 and Socata TB-20, and also some static simulators of Airbus A320 and Airbus A340.
In the air navigation department, it has control tower simulators (at 120 or 360 degrees).
ENAC has four Bachelor's degree courses to train pilots and aerospace technicians.
ENAC provide theoretical training for pilot students in eight months in its campus of Toulouse, and the practical training of 16 months, is given in the other campuses of the university in Montpellier, Carcassonne, Saint-Yan or Muret. Since 1992, graduates of this training are represented by an alumni association called AGEPAC. In parallel, the university propose a preparation for the Airline Transport Pilot Licence theory different by its purpose, allow high school students from low income families to become airline pilot, and its level of recruitment (End of high school). After that, students can prepare the Commercial pilot licence or going to he course "technicien aéronautique d'exploitation" (in English, aeronautical operations technician), training also accessible from two other recruitment. With a similar name but preparing for a different job, the curriculum "technicien supérieur de l'aviation" (in English, higher aviation Technician) allows the integration of the "techniciens supérieurs des études et de l'exploitation de l'aviation civile" (in English higher civil aviation operations Technicians) civil servant department or the one of the "techniciens supérieurs de l'aviation civils" ().
In addition, the university has seven Master's degree programs to train people for both aerospace industry and French civil aviation authority.
Going only to the civil aviation authority, the courses of Air traffic controller and Air Traffic Safety Electronics Personnel are done by the university. the "Ingénieur ENAC" course trains aerospace engineer in three sectors : electronics and aeronautical telecommunications (L), computer systems and air traffic (S) and aeronautical engineering (T). A small part (10 %), are civil servant engineering students. They become "ingénieurs des études et de l'exploitation de l'aviation civile" (civil aviation operations engineer) after the university. Since 1949, ENAC is a specialization university for "École Polytechnique" students.
Thus, since the 16th of April 2002 and the merger of the "corps des ingénieurs de l'aviation civile" (civil aviation engineer department) and thus of " géographie et de la météorologie" (geography and meteorology) into the Corps of Bridges and Roads, the training of managers of the French civil aviation authority has changed. The Corps of Bridges and Roads are trained at the "École des Ponts ParisTech" and part of the course (about 300 hours) is organized in cooperation with ENAC for students who wants to join the French civil aviation authority. Furthermore, the university has created in 2007 a Master's degree in International Air Transport Opération Management, in 2011 the course Master's degree in Global Navigation Satellite System supported by the European Commission and in 2012 the training Master's degree in Air Traffic Management in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Master's degree in Human–computer interaction (IHM) is realized in cooperation with the Paul Sabatier University.
Finally, the French Civil Aviation University provides seven "Mastères Spécialisés" courses in the fields : airport management, air transport management (in partnership with Toulouse Business School), communication - navigation - surveillance and satellite applications for aviation, aviation safety aircraft airworthiness (in partnership with other "grandes écoles"), air-ground collaborative systems engineering, aviation and air traffic management and aerospace project management (APM) (in partnership with other "grandes écoles").
The former students of the three Master programs, the "Ingénieur ENAC" course, as well as those of the Corps of Bridges and Roads and those of the "Mastères Spécialisés" courses was represented by an association, INGENAC, created in 1988, member of the CNISF (French scientific and engineer council) and in Toulouse. The 16th of March 2012, INGENAC decided to represent all the former students of the university and changes its name to « ENAC Alumni ».
Each course of the university has its own recruitment process.
By hosting each year more than 7,500 students who participate to more than 600 courses annually organized by the university, with a turnover of 15 million of euros, ENAC is now the largest organization in Europe for aeronautical continuing education. The continuing education of ENAC has been developed in areas which ENAC is well recognized : air traffic, electronics, computer science, aeronautical engineering, aircraft control, ...
Students of the aerospace engineer course can study at the two other "grandes écoles" members of the "groupement des écoles d'aéronautique", and also at the National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse and at Nantes business school. Moreover, as part of France AEROTECH, an exchange of third year engineering students is under elaboration with the "grandes écoles" of this network.
In another country, students have access to the Erasmus programme and to Pegasus. In the aerospace engineer course, the university welcomes 8% of foreign students in 2011. Considering all the courses, this number is 46% in 2010.
The university has also agreements with : Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Florida Institute of Technology, University of California, University of Washington, "École africaine de la météorologie et de l'aviation civile". It also educates people of the "Agence pour la sécurité de la navigation aérienne en Afrique et à Madagascar".
Also, ENAC is a founder of the "Institut sino-européen d'ingénierie de l'aviation" of Tianjin. On this city, the university has four "Mastères Spécialisés" courses at the Civil Aviation University of China only for Chinese students : airport management, aviation safety management - airworthiness, aviation safety management - flight operations and aviation safety management - aeronautical maintenance.
Finally, in December 2011, the university has signed a partnership with the "École des Ponts ParisTech" and the "Académie internationale Mohammed VI de l'aviation civile" to start an Executive MBA in aviation management for aerospace people in March 2012 at Casablanca.
Research is a growing business at ENAC. Industry oriented university, it appears in 1984, following the law on higher education which provides that « engineer training...contains a research activity, pure or applied ». It was originally organized around four areas : electronics, automation, computer and air transport economy. Mid-2009, the research teams was in the following laboratories : automation - operational research (LARA), economy - air econometrics (LEEA), study - optimization of telecommunications networks architectures (LEOPART), electromagnetism for aeronautical telecommunications (LETA), interactive computer (LII), applied mathematics (LMA), air traffic optimization (LOTA) and signal processing for the aeronautical telecommunications (LTST).
ENAC also has, since 2005, a team specializing in UAVs that maintains and develops "Paparazzi", a free system for automatic control of UAVs, unmanned aerial vehicle laboratory. The infrastructure includes also a planetarium and an air traffic control simulator. ENAC is a founding member of the European academy for aviation safety (EAFAS), network of the key training organizations in the field of air safety.
During the Paris Air Show of 2005, the university announces a partnership with "Office National d'Études et de Recherches Aérospatiales" in the fields of air traffic management, air safety, satellite navigation, sustainable development and air transport economy.
End of 2011, the university has established a new research organization that are six transverse programs : UAVs and air traffic management, airports, aircraft and air operations, human-computer interaction, air/ground communications and sustainable development, everything is now based on four laboratories : applied mathematics - optimization - optimal control - control engineering operations research (MAIAA), signal processing - satellite positioning system - electromagnetism - networks (TELECOM), architecture - modeling - engineering of interactive systems (LII) and economics - air transport econometrics (LEEA).
Several famous pilots have studied at the French Civil Aviation University like Émile Allegret, soldier and member of the French Resistance during the World War II, Xavier Barral (Promotion 1966), former President of the "association des professionnels navigants de l'aviation" (Professional aircrew association), Noël Chevrier (Promotion 1970), antistress center manager at Air France, Gérard Feldzer (Promotion 1971), former President of the "Aéro-Club de France", Bernard Pestel (Promotion 1972), vice president of the "société française de droit aérien" (French Air Law company), Béatrice Vialle (Promotion 1981), one of the two female Concorde pilot and the first French female pilot on a supersonic airliner.
Particularly because of its status of a French civil servant university, some civil servant has been student at ENAC like Jean-Marc de Raffin Dourny (Promotion 1966), President of the "organisme pour la sécurité de l'aviation civile" (organization for the safety of civil aviation), Michel Bernard (Promotion 1967), former head of the "Agence nationale pour l'emploi" and former President of "Air Inter", Paul-Louis Arslanian (Promotion 1968), former head of the French "Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile", Jean-Paul Troadec (Promotion 1970), head of the "Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile", Michel Wachenheim (Promotion 1975), French ambassador.
Some alumni of the university became managers like Yves Lambert (Promotion 1959), former head of Eurocontrol, Gérard Mestrallet (Promotion 1971), CEO of GDF Suez., Jean-Michel Vernhes (Promotion 1971), head of the Toulouse-Blagnac Airport, Jean-Charles Corbet (Promotion 1974), former head of "Air Lib", Olivier Colaïtis (Promotion 1977), President of Galileo, Lionel Guérin, founding President of Airlinair, Franck Goldnadel (Promotion 1990), head of the Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, Méziane Idjerouidène (Promotion 2003), general manager of Aigle Azur.
Few intellectuals graduate from the university like Jacques Villiers (Promotion 1948), founder of the "Centre d'études de la navigation aérienne" (French air navigation center), Jean Peyrelevade (Promotion 1961), politician and business leader, Hamza Ben Driss Ottmani (Promotion 1963), Moroccan economist and writer, Alain Lefebvre (Promotion 1970), Journalist, Solenn Colléter (Promotion 1993), novelist.
In science, personalities like Gabriel Weishaupt (Promotion 1948), founding member of the "Académie de l'air et de l'espace", Jean Robieux, Physicist, Georges Maignan (Promotion 1955), former director of the experimental center of Eurocontrol, Gérard Desbois (Promotion 1979), younger flight engineer graduate and crew member during the first flight of the Airbus A380, have studied at the university.
Some aerospace personalities teach at the university such as Hervé Hallot, meteorology teacher and co-author of "Météorologie aéronautique", Joel Laitselart (TAE 87), air operations teacher and former operations manager of Aeris airline, Patrick Lepourry, head of the engine department and co-author of "Propulseurs aéronautiques", "Instruments de bord" and "Initiation à l'aéronautique", Félix Mora-Camino, head of the control engineering department and co-author of "Avionique - Tome 2, Système de conduite automatique et gestion du vol" or Yves Plays (IENAC S71), head of the specialized master in air transport and co-author of "Initiation à l'aéronautique".

Institut Polytechnique des Sciences Avancées

The Institut polytechnique des sciences avancées, often called IPSA, is a private aeronautical university localized next to Paris and Toulouse in France, in the Île-de-France and Midi-Pyrénées,
The university is part of IONIS Education Group and has been created in 1961.
IPSA was founded in 1961 in Paris by Michel Cazin (private secretary to Louis de Broglie and teacher at the mechanical department of "Conservatoire national des arts et métiers"), Maurice Pradier (aerospace engineer) and Paul Lefort (engineer and professor of helicopter). Twenty students started the training. At that time, the course was in four years and the first promotion is graduated in 1965. The same year, the Alumni association is created in Paris by Maurice Ribonnet. In 1982, the first trip for students is organized in Guyana at the European Space Agency center. The year 1987 saw the university bought by Henri Hertert (IPSA 1976 and pilot at Air France). The institute moved in 1989 into the towers "Les Mercuriales" at Bagnolet, in which it stayed for ten years. Then, beset by financial difficulties, the university is bought by IONIS Education Group in 1999 and moved at Le Kremlin-Bicêtre close to the university EPITA.
In 2005, the Master issued by IPSA is recognized by French State at the higher level, after accreditation by the "Commission nationale de la certification professionnelle". The year 2006 sees the institute hosting the 6th European Congress of the Mars Society to promote the exploration of Mars. In 2007, IPSA opens a second campus in Toulouse, joins the Erasmus programme and concludes double degree agreements with foreign universities. Following its establishment in Toulouse, the university joins the "Institut au service du spatial, de ses applications et technologies" during the year 2008. The next year, IPSA joins Aerospace Valley and moved in Ivry-sur-Seine close to the university ESME-Sudria, before being recognized by the French State in 2010.
In 2011, the university is accredited by the "Commission des titres d'ingénieur". In January 2013, IPSA became member of the "Conférence des directeurs des écoles françaises d'ingénieurs".
The current director is Hervé Renaudeau, who was director of ESTACA university from 2007 to 2009. This is the seventh person to hold that function since 1961. He was appointed director of IPSA in September 2009.
Member of IONIS Education Group, the group President, assisted by a general manager, is the President of the university. He is a member of the four directorates of the university:
IPSA wants to be close to other universities with a strong theoretical training for research and development jobs in order to graduate engineer in aeronautical and space engineering with a good general knowledge in aerospace.
The course is in five years with five possibilities in the fourth year: "energy, spacecraft propulsion and engine", "mechanics and aircraft structure", "telecommunications, radar and radio navigation", "embedded system", "mechatronics". The students choose also one minor from ten: "Entrepreneurship", "business marketing", "association management", "Research Management", "Conduct of an international project", "project personnel development", "Board and consulting", " human resource management", "cultural management", "financial management".
In the fifth year, four options are available independently of the choice made in the fourth year: "Avionics", "Aeronautical Systems Design", " Space Systems Design" and "Management and Industrial Logistics".
The particularity of the university is to offer from the first year lessons relating to aeronautics in addition to basic scientific education and to provide a large part in project-based teaching throughout the curriculum.
Students also have the opportunity to attend a technical and managerial course sanctioned by a Master of Business Administration in "business and international negotiation" of the "Institut supérieur de gestion" in addition to the diploma of the university, or to make the last year of studies in a foreign university in partnership with IPSA. Eleven months of internship are planned in the curriculum.
After graduation, graduates are represented by the association "AAEIPSA" (IPSA Alumni association). They work, for 70% of them, in the aerospace industry, mainly in research and development (46%) and in the Île-de-France region (57%).
Admission to the university is possible after a "Baccalauréat" by succeeding to the competition "Advance" organized in partnership with EPITA and ESME-Sudria. In total, the three universities offer approximately 900 places. It is also possible to integrate the university in the second, third or fourth year studies for students coming from a two-years degree after the "Baccalauréat", Bachelor or Master.
Partnerships allowing students to obtain a Master of Science with the degree of IPSA exist with Shenyang University in China, Cranfield University in UK, Moscow State University in Russia, the "Université Laval" in Canada and the National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan.
Students can also use the Erasmus programme.
The university has also other partnerships with Arizona State University, San Diego State University, University of California at Davis and Monash University.
Research at IPSA is realized in 2011 by three laboratories : 3D computer graphics - calculation, mechatronics and fluid mechanics applied to aerodynamics.
The laboratory of 3D computer graphics and calculation creating new algorithms to solve problems of processing and analysis of signals and images. It works in partnership with the "laboratoire des signaux et systèmes" (L2S) (signals and systems laboratory) (agreement signed in 2010), a laboratory of the French National Centre for Scientific Research based at "Supélec".
"IPS'action" association has launched in 2006 the « UNIV'air » challenge in order to present to people research projects in partnership with the "Association Aéronautique et Astronautique de France" and other universities such as the "École nationale supérieure de l'aéronautique et de l'espace" or EPF.
In 2008, an aircraft without pilot project named « Hélitronix » and realized by students and researchers of the mechatronics laboratory was selected during the « "Minidrone" » challenge funded by the General Directorate for Armament and organized by the "Office National d'Études et de Recherches Aérospatiales". The same laboratory works on the « Perseus project » which consists of the development of rockets from the "Centre national d'études spatiales", in partnership with « "AéroIPSA" » student association.
Moreover, IPSA participates to « "ASTech Paris Région" ». It contributes at its development in many sectors : aircraft engine, onboard energy, aircraft design, material, training and research, and maintenance.
In November 2011, the fluid mechanics applied to aerodynamics laboratory created in 2009 has adopted a new calculation tool allowing for the end of 2011 the commissioning of a digital wind tunnel.
Several managers have studied at the university, like Cyril Bourlon de Rouvre (1965), French businessman and politician, Philippe Harache (1976), former Executive Vice-President "customers" Eurocopter, Christian Gras (1983), Executive Vice-President "customers" Eurocopter or Éric Boullier (1999), Team principal Renault F1.
Stéphane Gaillard (1997), Technical Assistant to Vice President development flight test Airbus and Julien Simon-Chautemps (2002), race Engineer Kimi Räikkönen Renault F1, are also alumni of IPSA.

Büsingen am Hochrhein

Büsingen am Hochrhein is a German town. It is part of the German state "(Bundesland)" of Baden-Württemberg. The town belongs to the district "(Kreis)" of Konstanz. Büsingen has an area of about . As of December 2010, about 1,400 people live there. This town is the only exclave of Germany. It is located in Switzerland. Büsingen is surrounded by the Swiss Cantons of Schaffhausen, Zürich and Thurgau. In the south, its border is the river Rhine.
About 700m of Swiss land are between the town and German mainland. The village next to Büsingen is the Swiss village of Dörflingen.
Because Switzerland signed the Schengen Agreement, there are no border controls between Büsingen and Switzerland and the rest of Germany.
Because the town is in the Swiss territory, but German, many things exist twice in there. Büsingen has for example two postal codes and area codes. The official currency is the Euro. However, most things like electricity and water come from Switzerland and have to be paid in Swiss Francs. Büsingen belongs politically to Germany, but depends on Switzerland in economics.
Büsingen only has one elementary school. Pupils can attend the school there up to the fourth grade. After this, the parents have to decide whether the children should attend a German or a Swiss school.
The oldest finds in the area of Büsingen date back to the Bronze Age. The town was first officially mentioned in 1090.

Mastère Spécialisé

A Mastère Spécialisé (MS) also called Specialized Master or Advanced Master is the French degree (created in 1986) that a person gets after he completes his Master's degree and continues to study in a Grande École in some specific field. In other words, a person must first get his Master's degree before he can get a Mastère Spécialisé. These people are considered to possess more advanced knowledge of the field that they had studied, as compared to those who only get a Master's degree. 
The course has a duration of one year including at least four months of internship.
The history of the Mastère Spécialisé starts in 1986. During the end of the 1980s, the "Commission des titres d'ingénieur" required that a student spend two years in a school to graduate with the French Master's degree. But a lot of foreign students sometimes came one entirely year in the French schools and came back to their own country without a degree. Also, the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System was not yet adopted by all the schools.
Otherwise, companies in France was looking for graduated students with specialized skills, for jobs in key sectors.
For these two reasons, the French "Conférence des Grandes Écoles" has created the Mastère Spécialisé.

Beaumaris Castle

Beaumaris Castle (, Literal translation: "beautiful marsh") was a castle built in Beaumaris, Anglesey, Wales by King Edward I of England. King Edward built the castle to help him take over North Wales. It was one of several castles built along the North Wales coast.
The castle was started in 1295 and work stopped in 1330. The castle was left unfinished. Small amounts of money were spent in the 1330s and 1400s to maintain (keep up) the castle. However, these payments were stopped. By 1609, the castle was a ruin. In 1642, money was spent on repairs. No more work was done and it became a ruin again. In 1925, Richard Williams-Bulkeley placed Beaumaris Castle in state care. Since then, it has been fixed and maintained. In 1986, the castle was placed on the World Heritage List.

Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines

Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines is a French public university created in 1991, in the department of Yvelines and since 2002, in Hauts-de-Seine. It is mainly in the cities of Versailles, Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, Mantes-en-Yvelines and Vélizy-Villacoublay and Rambouillet. It has eight campuses.
It has 19,000 students, 752 staff people and 1389 teachers and researchers. 285 teachers outside of the university come each year to give courses.
The subjects taught are the sciences, the social sciences, the political sciences, engineering, technology and medicine. It also has courses about the relationship between economy, ethics, natural environment and sustainable development.
Some Parisian universities had anticipated the decree of the French Ministry of National Education and had relocated part of their activities outside of Paris. In fact, experiencing a significant increase of their numbers, they begin to open new locations to alleviate their main campuses. Thus, an antenna of the Pierre and Marie Curie University is created in Versailles in 1987. Dedicated to Sciences, it joined in the Yvelines the law annex of Nanterre established two years earlier at Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.
In the mean time, the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research program as part of French higher education modernization plan called "Université 2000" the creation of new universities.

At the end of 1996, the university changes its special status to join the regime of the law of 1984, as well as other French universities. UVSQ elects its instances and its first President, Michel Garnier, at the beginning of 1997. He sets up the final structure (board of directors, scientific council, student life council) which then proceeded to his election. It is then the turn of Dominique Gentile to be at the President of the university, from 1997 to 2002.
This period is marked by a strong evolution of the French higher education and the university took the opportunity to consolidate : creation of the Doctoral colleges and prefiguration of UniverSud Paris.

Cuthbert

Saint Cuthbert (c. 634 – 20 March 687) was an Anglo-Saxon monk, bishop and hermit associated with the monasteries of Melrose and Lindisfarne in the Kingdom of Northumbria, at that time including, in modern terms, northern England as well as south-eastern Scotland as far north as the Firth of Forth. Afterwards he became one of the most important medieval saints of England, his cult being centred at Durham Cathedral. Cuthbert is regarded as the patron saint of northern England. His feast day is 20 March.
In 676 he began the life of a hermit and retired to a cave on Lindisfarne. After a time he settled on one of the Farne Islands, south of Lindisfarne, and made his life more simple. 
In 684, Cuthbert was chosen to be bishop of Lindisfarne, at a synod at Twyford (believed to be present-day Alnmouth), but was unwilling to leave his retirement and take up his charge. It was only after a visit from a large group, including King Ecgfrith, that he agreed to return and take up the duties of bishop. He was consecrated at York on 26 March 685. After Christmas, 686, however, he returned to his cell on Inner Farne Island, which was where he eventually died on 20 March 687 AD. He was buried at Lindisfarne, and his remains later moved to Durham Cathedral.

Lofoten is an archipelago and a traditional district in the county of Nordland, Norway. Though lying within the Arctic Circle, Lofoten has one of the world's largest higher temperature anomalies relative to its high latitude.
Lofoten is well known for its natural beauty within Norway. Lofoten includes the municipalities of . The main islands, running from north to south, are
whilst further to the south are the small and isolated islands of Værøy and Røst. The total land area amounts to 1,227 km², and the population totals 24,500.
Between the mainland and the Lofoten archipelago is the vast, open Vestfjord, and to the north is Vesterålen. The main towns in Lofoten are Leknes in Vestvågøy and Svolvær in Vågan.
The islands have for more than 1,000 years been the centre of great cod fisheries, especially in winter, when the cod migrate south from the Barents Sea and gather in Lofoten to spawn. In the lowland areas, particularly Vestvågøy, agriculture is important and has been so since the Bronze Age.

Black hole information paradox

The black hole information paradox is a phenomenon in astrophysics. It is when quantum mechanics and general relativity are put together. 
This phenomenon states that the information a physical system has can be lost when it enters a black hole. The object that falls into a black hole, only keeps information about its spin, mass and charge. However, the quantum mechanics says that information cannot be lost. This makes it a paradox.

Sabena Flight Academy

CAE Global Academy Brussels Sabena Flight Academy is a Belgian flight school created in 1953. It is in Steenokkerzeel (Brussels Airport). The school trains airline pilot and is part of CAE Global Academy.
The origins of the creation of a school providing training for future airline pilots start in 1953, when the Belgian government, which owns the aircraft, contracted the operation thereof to Sabena under the name "École d’aviation civile" (EAC). The theoretical and flight training parts are conducted at the airfield of Grimbergen in a building which no longer exists. Basic training is done through the De Havilland DH82A "Tiger Moth" replaced in 1968 by Siai Marchetti SF260, while the advanced training is entrusted to the Saab Safir 91B, replaced in 1958 by the Cessna 310B and in 1981 by the Embraer Xingu.
In 1991, the government gives the "École d’aviation civile" to Sabena airline. It is renowned first Belgian Aviation School and then Sabena Air Training Center, and the school moved into a new building at Brussels National Airport. It was decided to carry out practical training in flight to Phoenix in U.S.A because the weather in Arizona allows flights 365 days per year in a high and complex air traffic. Despite the bankruptcy of Sabena in 2001, the activities didn't stop. In 2004, the school was sold to two former managers of Sabena and became the Sabena Flight Academy.
It is finally absorbed in 2008 by the Canadian group CAE. The acquisition of SFA by CAE was conducted as part of a larger program to complete a global training network: the CAE Global Academy.

Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty

An Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) is an area of countryside considered to have significant landscape value in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. Natural England designates them on behalf of the United Kingdom government. The Countryside Council for Wales designates them on behalf of the Welsh Government. The Northern Ireland Environment Agency designates them on behalf of the Northern Ireland Executive.
The chief purpose of the AONB designation is to conserve and enhance the natural beauty of the landscape, with two secondary aims: meeting the need for quiet enjoyment of the countryside and having regard for the interests of those who live and work there. To achieve these aims, AONBs rely on planning controls and practical countryside management.
As they have the same landscape quality, AONBs may be compared to the national parks of England and Wales. AONBs are created under the same legislation as the national parks, the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. Unlike AONBs, national parks have their own authorities, have special legal powers to prevent unsympathetic development, and are well known to many inhabitants of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. 
There are 35 AONBs in England, four in Wales, one (Wye Valley) that is in both England and Wales and nine in Northern Ireland. The first AONB was awarded in 1956 to the Gower Peninsula, south Wales. The most recently confirmed is the Tamar Valley AONB in 1994. The smallest AONB is the Isles of Scilly (1976), , and the largest AONB is the Cotswolds (1966), . The AONBs of England and Wales together cover around 18% of the countryside in the two countries.

Chaturanga

Chaturanga is the earliest known form of chess, 6th century AD. 
This precursor of modern chess originated in the northern Indian subcontinent during the Gupta empire. 'Chaturanga' translates as 'the four divisions', meaning infantry, cavalry, elephantry, and chariotry. They were the four divisions of an Indian army at the time, and no doubt the game was thought of as a war-game. At that time the game had no female piece: what we now call the queen was called "Mantri", meaning a minister or advisor. 
The game eventually spread to the rest of the world after the Muslim conquest of Persia. It was then called Shatranj.
From the beginning until the end of the 15th century the pieces we call bishops and queens had limited movement, and it took longer to get the pieces into action. In modern chess, the original pieces evolved into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.<ref name="H/W">Hooper, David and Whyld, Kenneth 1992.

Shatranj

Chatrang, or Shatranj, was the name given to the early game of chess when it travelled to Persia and then to the Arab world.
In Sassanid Persia around 600 the name became Chatrang and the rules were developed further, and players started calling "Shāh!" (Persian for 'King') when threatening the opponent's king, and "Shāh māt!" (Persian for 'the king is finished') when the king could not escape from attack. These exclamations persisted in chess as it traveled to other lands.
The game was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia, with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names; in Arabic "māt" or "māta" مَاتَ means "died", "is dead". In Arabic, the game became Shatranj. In all other languages, the name of the game is derived either from "shatranj" or from "shah".
One interesting fact is that the Arabs divided their game into the same three stages which we do today: opening, middlegame and endgame.
At the start of a game, the Arabic masters took a number of moves before the pieces were in contact with the other side.
The following table provides a glimpse of the changes in the names and character of chess pieces, as they passed from one culture to another, from India through Persia to Europe:

Carbon–hydrogen bond activation

Carbon–hydrogen bond activation or C-H activation is a reaction that breaks a carbon–hydrogen bond. Most times, the reaction involves organometallic complexes. The reaction path has coordination of a hydrocarbon to the inner-sphere of the metal atom (“M”). The reaction path includes either an intermediate “alkane or arene complex” or as a transition state leading to a "M-C" intermediate. The reaction path makes C-H activation different from other reactions. During the C-H breaking event the hydrocarbyl group remains linked in the inner-sphere and under the influence of the metal atom.
Chemists study C-H activation because for many years chemists believed that C-H bonds were unreactive. Both theoretical studies as well as experiments now show that C-H bonds can be broken. This is done by a nearby metal atom changing the electron distribution of the C-H bond (coordination). Much chemical research looks at the design and synthesis of new reagents and catalysts that can affect C-H activation. The goal of this research is the conversion of cheap and abundant alkanes into valuable functionalized organic compounds.
Historians say that Otto Dimroth discovered the first C-H activation reaction. In 1902, he reported that benzene reacted with mercury(II) acetate (See: organomercury), but some scholars do not view this reaction as being a C-H activation. Goldman & Goldberg later wrote, C-H activation looks like H-H activation: both can be achieved by electrophilic or oxidative addition. The first true C-H activation reaction was reported by Joseph Chatt in 1965 with insertion of a ruthenium atom ligated to dmpe in the C-H bond of naphthalene.

Egyptian literature

Egyptian literature is some of the earliest known literature. The Egyptians were the first culture to develop the book.
The ancient Egyptians wrote on papyrus. They also wrote on walls, tombs, pyramids, obelisks, and more. A well-known example of ancient Egyptian literature is the Story of Sinuhe;
Alexandria became an important center of early Christianity from around the 1st to 4th century CE. Writing by Coptic Christians was important to Christian literature at that time.The Nag Hammadi library protected some books from being lost or destroyed.
Muslim Arabs controlled Egypt by the eighth century. Libraries and literature were important in Arab Egypt. Several important changes for writers happened at this time. Cloth paper replaced papyrus. Writers began using calligraphy. Also, writers began to write mostly about Islam. The earliest novel written in Egypt was Ibn al-Nafis' "Theologus Autodidactus". It was an early science fiction and religious novel.
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Arab world experienced a cultural change like the Renaissance. This was called al-Nahda movement. It touched nearly all areas of life, including literature. One of the most important people from this time was Naguib Mahfouz. He was first Egyptian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Another important modern writer was Muhammad Husayn Haykal. He wrote "Zaynab" in 1914. It is an Islamic novel and is called the first modern Egyptian novel.

Phormium tenax

Phormium tenax ("harakeke" in Māori, New Zealand flax) is an evergreen perennial plant from New Zealand and Norfolk Island. It is an important fibre plant and also a popular garden plant. 
The plant grows as a clump of long, straplike leaves up to two meters long. It grows a much taller flowering shoot, with dramatic yellow or red flowers.
The fibre from the plant was used by the Māori of New Zealand to make baskets. It was also used in rope and sail making. after the arrival of Europeans up until at least WWII
In other countries "Phormium tenax" is an invasive species. On Saint Helena it is taking over the land from the critically endangered species "Elaphoglossum dimorphum". 
The jumping spider "Trite planiceps" lives in the rolled-up leaves of this species. "Phormium tenax" grows on the coast where it is important in the breeding habitat for the endangered Yellow-eyed Penguin.
Several forms of this species have been selected for cultivation as decorative garden plants including: The Royal Horticultural Society in England gave an Award of Garden Merit to the plant.

Extensive reading

Extensive reading is a way of learning a language, especially a second or foreign language.
"Free voluntary reading" is one name for extensive reading in first language education. Learners can choose a book that they like and to read it quickly or slowly. A free voluntary reading program is to help students to enjoy reading, so there are often no grades. In some schools this approach is also called "Drop Everything and Read" (DEAR).
In 1988, Day and Bamford described extensive reading for learning a second or foreign language. Students read as much as possible. Reading materials should use simple grammar and vocabulary so learners feel comfortable. Learners should read many different kinds of writing about different subjects. 
Many extensive reading programs use special series of books. These books use simplified grammar and vocabulary. They may be original stories, but many are shorter, easier versions of classic books.
Many teachers and some learners believe that extensive reading alone is enough to improve vocabulary. McQuillan and Krashen also believe this.However, other researchers say that extensive reading alone is not enough. Cobb and Parry have done research to show that there is a limit. Extensive reading may not improve vocabulary as much as people thought, especially for less common words.

Chemical education

Chemistry education is the study of the teaching and learning of chemistry. Topics in chemistry education include understanding how students learn chemistry and how best to teach chemistry. Researchers in chemistry education try to improve learning results by improving teaching methods and training chemistry teachers. Researchers study many teaching modes, including: classroom lecture, demonstrations, and laboratory activities.
There is a world-wide shortage of chemistry teachers. This is because people with science training can get jobs that pay more outside of teaching. It is hard to keep science teachers. More than 45,000 math and science teachers left teaching in the United States just after the 1999–2000 school year.
There are several different ways of thinking about chemistry education. One is a "practitioner’s perspective". The people who teach chemistry define chemistry education by their actions.
Another is defined by a self-identified group of "chemical educators" (faculty members and instructors who focus on teaching rather than focus on chemical research). Dr. Robert L. Lichter, then-Executive Director of the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation, speaking in a plenary session at the 16th Biennial Conference on Chemical Education (recent BCCE meetings: ,), posed the question “why do terms like ‘chemical educator’ even exist in higher education, when there is a perfectly respectable term for this activity, namely, ‘chemistry professor.’" One criticism of this view is that few professors bring any formal preparation in education or background about education to their jobs. Most chemistry professors do not have a professional perspective on teaching and learning efforts. They may not know about effective teaching methods and how students learn.
A third perspective is "chemical education research" (CER). Following the example of physics education research (PER), CER tends to take the theories and methods developed in pre-college science education research and applies them to understanding comparable problems in post-secondary settings. (CER also tries to improve pre-college chemistry instruction). Like science education researchers, CER practitioners tend to study the teaching practices of others as opposed to focusing on their own classroom practices. Chemical education research is typically carried out "in situ" using human subjects from secondary and post-secondary schools. Chemical education research collects both quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative methods typically involve collecting data that can then be analyzed using various statistical methods. Qualitative methods include interviews, observations, journaling, and other methods common to social science research.

He started with minor clubs in Vienna and came to First Vienna FC in 1937. He played in this team until 1952. During the occupation of Austria by Nazi-Germany he and his team were very successful. They won three times the Gauliga Donau-Alpenland of the Ostmark, as Austria was called at this time (1942, 1943, 1944), and the Tschammer-Pokal (German Cup) in 1943. 8 times he played for the German football national team. After the end of the war he played 25 matches for the Austrian team between 1945 and 1952. 1944 and 1950 he was the top scorer of the league. He also played for S.K. Sturm Graz, then for Sochaux in France and for Grenchen in Swizerland.
He was coach of Sturm Graz (1952–1954),FC Grenchen (1956–1958) and SK Rapid Wien (1968–1970). With Rapid he reached the Quarterfinals of the European Champion Cup and won in the third round against Real Madrid. In the quarterfinals they lost versus Manchester United.
Between 1958 and 1964 he was coach of the Austrian national football team. In this time the team was very successful. They won versus Scotland(4:1), UdSSR (3:1 and 1:0), Spain(3:0 in front of 90.726 visitors-this is the record in Austria), Italy(2:1), England (3:1) and Hungary(2:1 and 2:1). They qualified for the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile but the ÖFB had not enough money to send the team to the competition. Nevertheless the era Decker was one of the best for Austria's national football team.

<doc id="306054" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=306054" title="Bisphenol A">
Bisphenol A

Bisphenol A (BPA) is an organic compound which has two phenol functional groups. It is used to make polycarbonate plastic, epoxy resins, and other things.
Scientist discovered in the mid 1930s that people and animals react to BPA in the same way that they react to hormone (oestrogen-like effects.) Some stores stopped selling products made with BPA in 2008 because government reports said BPA was not safe for humans. Many news stories wrote about BPA safety. 
A 2010 report from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said that contact with BPA could hurt fetuses (unborn children), infants and young children. In September 2010, Canada became the first country to say that BPA was a toxic substance. In the European Union and Canada, BPA cannot be used to make baby bottles.
Bisphenol A damages the way hormones regulate (control) the human body (endocrine disruptor). BPA can pretend to be the body's own hormones. BPA may cause health problems. Very young children are most sensitive to BPA. Some studies have shown that there is a link (connection) between BPA exposure before birth (prenatal) and later problems of the nervous system. Health organizations have decided how much BPA (in a substance) is safe for people. But new studies have caused other scientists and health organizations to disagree with these decisions. A 2011 study that investigated the number of chemicals to which pregnant women in the U.S. are exposed found BPA in 96% of women.
In 2009, The Endocrine Society said it was worried about current human exposure to BPA.
In 2011, the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency's chief scientist said "the evidence [is] that BPA is rapidly absorbed, detoxified, and eliminated from humans – therefore is not a health concern."
In 2007, 38 experts on bisphenol A wrote a consensus statement which said average levels in people are above those that cause harm to many animals in laboratory experiments. However, the experts noted that 1) BPA is not persistent in the environment or in humans, 2) biomonitoring surveys indicate that exposure is continuous, 3) it is hard to use acute animal exposure studies to estimate daily human exposure to BPA, and 4) no studies that had examined BPA pharmacokinetics in animal models had followed continuous low level exposures. The measurement of BPA levels in human serum and other body fluids suggests that either BPA intake is much higher than previously thought or that BPA can bioaccumulate in some conditions such as pregnancy, or both. A 2011 study, the first to examine BPA in a continuous low level exposure throughout the day, did find an increased absorption and accumulation of BPA in the blood of mice.
In 2007, 153 government-funded BPA experiments on lab animals and tissues found adverse effects and 14 did not. In contrast, all 13 studies funded by chemical corporations reported no harm. The studies indicating harm reported a variety of deleterious effects in rodent offspring exposed in the womb: abnormal weight gain, insulin resistance, prostate cancer, and too much mammary gland development. 
A panel convened by the U.S. National Institutes of Health in 2007 determined that there was "some concern" about BPA's effects on fetal and infant brain development and behavior. The concern over the effect of BPA on infants was also heightened by the fact that infants and children are estimated to have the highest daily intake of BPA. A 2008 report by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) later agreed with the panel, expressing "some concern for effects on the brain, behavior, and prostate gland in fetuses, infants, and children at current human exposures to bisphenol A," and ""minimal" concern for effects on the mammary gland and an earlier age for puberty for females in fetuses, infants, and children at current human exposures to bisphenol A." The NTP had ""negligible" concern that exposure of pregnant women to bisphenol A will result in fetal or neonatal mortality, birth defects, or reduced birth weight and growth in their offspring."

Islamic State's West Africa Province

Boko Haram is a branch of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. It has been active in Nigeria since 2009. The name of the group means "Western" or "non-Islamic" education is a sin. The group is active in the north of Nigeria, and wants to impose Islamic law as the only law in Nigeria. It also wants to outlaw education that is not based on Islam in the country. The group sees itself as similar to the Taliban, which are active in Afghanistan. Locally, the group is known as the "Taliban". The official name of the group is "Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad", which in Arabic means "People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet's Teachings and Jihad."
The group was formed in Maiduguri in 2002. They follow Sunni Islam. Local residents of the area soon called the group Boko Haram. Loosely translated from the local Hausa language, this means Western education is forbidden. Residents gave it the name because of its strong opposition to Western education, which it sees as corrupting Muslims. The term "Boko Haram" comes from the Hausa word 'boko' meaning "Animist, western or otherwise non-Islamic education" and the Arabic word 'haram' figuratively meaning "sin" (literally, "forbidden").
Boko Haram opposes not only Western education, but Western culture and modern science as well. The group also forbids the wearing of shirts and pants and the act of voting in elections. In its view, the Nigerian state is run by non-believers.
In a 2009 BBC interview, Mohammed Yusuf, the group's leader at the time, stated that he rejects the fact that the earth is a sphere and views it as contrary to Islam, along with Darwinism and the fact that rain comes from water evaporated by the sun.
There are a number of terrorist activities for which Boko Haram have claimed responsibility: 
Boko Haram is not associated with the group Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta which fights against the oil industry in the Niger Delta, since 2006.
On April 14 2014, Boko Haram kidnapped 200 schoolgirls. Boko Haram killed at least 100 people in Baga in January 2015. About 620 buildings were damaged or destroyed by fire.
Boko Haram became part of Islamic State in March 2015.

Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta

The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta is one of the largest militant groups in the Niger delta. Many people in the delta are poor. The Nigerian government has contracts that allow international companies to extract crude oil in the delta. This extraction causes massive damage to the environment. According to the magazine "The Economist", the organization wants more of the profit of the oil extraction to go to the poor region, where the oil is extracted.. 
According to the magazine, the organisation is used by several armed groups; these groups are sometimes paid to launch attacks. The payment is done either with weapons or with money.
MEND has been linked to attacks on petroleum operations in Nigeria as part of the Conflict in the Niger Delta, engaging in actions including sabotage, theft, property destruction, guerrilla warfare, and kidnapping.
MEND's stated goals are to localize control of Nigeria's oil and to secure reparations from the federal government for pollution caused by the oil industry. In an interview with one of the group's leaders, who used the alias Major-General Godswill Tamuno, the BBC reported that MEND was fighting for "total control" of the Niger Delta's oil wealth, saying local people had not gained from the riches under the ground and the region's creeks and swamps." 
In a January 2006 email, MEND warned the oil industry, "It must be clear that the Nigerian government cannot protect your workers or assets. Leave our land while you can or die in it... Our aim is to totally destroy the capacity of the Nigerian government to export oil." Additionally MEND has called upon President Olusegun Obasanjo to free two jailed Ijaw leaders — Mujahid Dokubo-Asari, who is jailed and charged with treason, and Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, a former governor of Bayelsa State convicted of corruption. Obasanjo's successor, President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua authorised the release of Dokubo-Asari and Alamieyeseigha in 2007.

Urbanization

Urbanization (or urbanisation) is a term from geography. The base of the word is the Latin "urbs", which means city. The term urbanisation means that lifestyle that is common in a city becomes prevalent. This can happen in two different ways:
Physical urbanization has been observed for centuries. In developing countries this is the main form of urbanization. In developed countries, functional urbanization is the main form of urbanization. With functional urbanization, people living in the city center move to the countryside, next to the city; this is known as suburbanization.
Environmental scientists are studying the urban heat island. The urban heat island is made when industrial and urban areas are developed and heat becomes plentiful. In country areas, a large part of the incoming solar energy goes to evaporate water from vegetation and soil. But cities have less vegetation and soil. In cities, most of the sun’s energy is absorbed by urban building and asphalt paving. During warm daylight hours, there is less evaporative cooling in cities than in country areas. So, surface temperatures rise higher in cities than in country areas. 
Also, vehicles, factories, and industrial and domestic heating and cooling units give off more heat in cities. This problem is growing. This effect causes the city to become 2 to 10 F (1 to 6 C) warmer than surrounding rural areas. Environmental impacts also include reducing soil moisture and intensification of carbon dioxide emissions.
Stewart Brand's book "Whole Earth Discipline" argues that urbanization helps the environment overall. First, the birth rate of new urban dwellers falls immediately to replacement rate, and keeps falling. This can prevent overpopulation in the future. Secondly, it puts a stop to destructive subsistence farming methods, like slash and burn agriculture. Finally, it reduces land use by humans, leaving more for nature.

You Suffer

"You Suffer" is a song by the British grindcore band Napalm Death. It is from their debut album, "Scum". "Guinness Book of Records" has mentioned the song as the shortest recorded song ever. It is precisely 1.316 seconds long.
The song was written by band members Nicholas Bullen and Justin Broadrick. This was during the sessions for the "From Enslavement to Obliteration" demo recording in March 1986. The song is featured on the album "Scum", released in 1987.
According to Broadrick, "You Suffer" was meant as a joke. He called it "retarded", "ridiculous" but "hilarious". He added that they played the song "in front of 30 local kids, like, every weekend." for about thirty times.
Nic Bullen said that the short length of the song was inspired by Wehrmacht's 1985 song "E!"
Zak Smith quotes the lyrics to the song, which he describes as the ""shortest" punk song on the subject of suffering (or any subject)" at the conclusion of his memoir "We Did Porn".
A music video produced by Earache records was released for the song in March 2007. This was on the same day that the "Scum" dualdisc was released.

Jagged Little Pill

Jagged Little Pill is the third studio album and the first to be released internationally by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. The album saw Morissette changing her style and genre. Morissette's sound in the album was rock, but her previous songs were dance pop. The title is a metaphor for lessons of life that are hard to accept. The album was Morissette's breakthrough album, and contained six hits, "You Oughta Know", "Ironic", "You Learn", "Hand in My Pocket", "Head over Feet", and "All I Really Want". The album spent twelve weeks at number one on the U.S. "Billboard" 200 albums chart. By 2009, the album had sold 33 million units worldwide. It was ranked by the "Billboard" 200 as the number one selling album of the 1990s.
During the three consecutive years in the late 1990s of Grammy Awards, Morissette received five wins out of nine nominations from the album. In 1996, she won the Album of the Year & Best Rock Album. Her 1997 nominations such as "Ironic" for Record of the Year & Best Music Video in Short Form did not win her an award. But in 1998, she won again for Best Music Video in Long Form from her release of "Jagged Little Pill, Live". In October 2002, "Rolling Stone" ranked it number 31 on its "Women In Rock - The 50 Essential Albums" list, and in 2003 the magazine ranked it number 327 on its list of "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time".

Jack Layton

John Gilbert "Jack" Layton, PC (July 18, 1950 – August 22, 2011) was a Canadian politician and the Leader of the Official Opposition. He was the leader of the New Democratic Party from 2003 to 2011, and previously sat on Toronto City Council. He was the Member of Parliament for the constituency of Toronto—Danforth from 2004 until his death.
He was a son of Progressive Conservative cabinet minister Robert Layton (1925-2002). He was born in Montreal and raised in Hudson, Quebec. He rose to prominence in Toronto municipal politics where he campaigned tirelessly for the needs of ordinary citizens and for environmental issues. Eventually, he became head of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. In 2003, he was elected leader of the NDP on the first ballot of the convention, and the NDP almost doubled its popular vote in the 2004 election.
Thirty seven NDP MPs were elected under Layton in the 2008 election. In the 2011 federal election, he led the NDP to a historic total of 103 seats and formed the Official Opposition. Although recovering from illness, Layton campaigned tirelessly, and inspired many people. Importantly, the NDP had increased its number of Quebec MPs from one to fifty-nine seats, almost eliminating the previous Bloc Québécois MPs. 
Layton died at his home in Toronto on August 22, 2011, aged 61, after suffering from an undisclosed type of cancer. Layton's body had a lying-in-state before a state funeral was held in Toronto. He was married to fellow MP Olivia Chow.

QRpedia is a web system for mobile devices, like mobile phones. It uses QR codes to show Wikipedia articles to people. The articles are shown in the user's own language.
A user uses their mobile device to scan a QRpedia QR code. The device decodes the QR code into a web address. The address has the domain name "qrwp.org". The last part of the web address is the title of a Wikipedia article.
The device sends a request for the article to the QRpedia web server. It also transmits the name of the language used by the device.
The QRpedia server then uses Wikipedia's API to find out if there is a version of the specified Wikipedia article in the language used by the device. If there is, it sends back the article in a mobile-friendly format. If there is no translation of the requested article, then the QRpedia server offers a choice of the available languages. It also offers a Google translation.
In this way, a single QRcode can be used to find the same article, in many languages. QRpedia also records usage statistics.
QRpedia was invented by Roger Bamkin, who is chairman of Wikimedia UK, and Terence Eden. who is a mobile web consultant. It was unveiled on 9 April 2011 It was unveiled at Derby Museum's "Backstage Pass" event. The event was part of the GLAM/Derby collaboration between Derby Museum and Art Gallery and Wikipedia. During the collaboration, over 500 Wikipedia articles were also created. The articles were in several languages. The project's name is a made-up word, using the initials "QR" from "QR (Quick Response) code" and "pedia" from "Wikipedia".

Conrotatory and disrotatory

These terms describe two classes of an electrocyclic reaction (a type of organic chemical reactions). In a conrotatory mode, the substituents located at the ends of a conjugated double bond system move in the same (clockwise or counterclockwise) direction during ring opening or ring closure. In a disrotatory mode, they move in opposite directions.
An example is the conversion of trans-cis-trans-2,4,6-octatriene to cis-dimethylcyclohexadiene (top of figure). The orbital mechanics of the reaction needs a disrotatory mode. The orbital symmetry of the octatriene's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) requires for the end pi orbitals to move in opposite directions to form the correct symmetry found in the sigma bond. 
Thermal rearrangements of all conjugated systems containing 4n + 2 pi electron are stereospecific. This is based on preservation of orbital symmetry in the highest occupied molecular orbital. Systems containing 4n pi electrons show the opposite conrotatory mode. This is also true for rearrangements of 4n + 2 pi (where n is a whole number) electrons driven by light (photoinduced). Photoinduced rearrangements of 4n pi electron systems (where the number of electrons is divisible by 4) follow the disrotatory rule.
The Woodward–Hoffmann rules summarize the above different reactions.
The following picture also shows the difference between conrotatory and disrotatory reactions:

The Odontoceti are a suborder of the cetaceans. They are the toothed whales.
The Odontoceti includes all the whales which eat prey larger than plankton. Examples are: sperm whales, beaked whales, dolphins, and others. As the name suggests, the suborder has teeth rather than the baleen of Mysticeti whales. This means they are predators of small to large sized prey. 
The Sperm Whale "Physeter", the Killer Whale "Orca" and the Pilot Whale "Globicephala" all take large prey. By means of co-operation, Killer Whales can take prey larger than themselves, up to and including Blue Whale calves. Sperm Whales are specialist feeders on giant squid.

Herring gull

The herring gull ("Larus argentatus" or European herring gull) is a large gull (up to 26 inches or 66 cm long). It is the most abundant and best known of all gulls along the shores of western Europe. It breeds across Northern Europe, Western Europe, Scandinavia and the Baltic states. 
Some herring gulls, especially those resident in colder areas, migrate further south in winter, but many are permanent residents, e.g. in the British Isles, Iceland, or on the North Sea shores. European herring gulls are also abundant around inland garbage dumps, and some have even adapted to life in inland cities.
The taxonomy of the herring gull / lesser black-backed gull group is very complicated, with different authorities recognising between two and eight species.
This group has a ring distribution around the northern hemisphere. Differences between adjacent forms in this ring are fairly small, but by the time the circuit is completed, the end members, herring gull and lesser black-backed gull, are clearly different species.

Lesser black-backed gull

The lesser black-backed gull ("Larus fuscus") is a large gull that breeds on the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is migratory, wintering from the British Isles south to West Africa. It is a regular winter visitor to the east coast of North America, probably from the breeding population in Iceland.
This species breeds in colonies on coasts and lakes. It makes a lined nest on the ground or a cliff. Normally, three eggs are laid. In some cities the species nests in towns and cities, often with herring gulls.
They are similar in size but slightly smaller than the herring gull. The taxonomy of the herring gull / lesser black-backed gull group is very complicated. Different authorities recognise between two and eight species. This group has a ring distribution around the northern hemisphere. Differences between adjacent forms in this ring are fairly small, but by the time the circuit is completed, the end members, herring gull and lesser black-backed gull, are clearly different species.
The only species it might be confused with in Europe is the great black-backed gull. Lesser is a smaller bird, with slimmer build, yellow rather than pinkish legs, and smaller white "mirrors" at the wing tips. 
The bill is yellow with a red spot. When the young peck the red spot, The adults feed them by regurgitation. This is an inherited behaviour called a fixed action pattern or releaser.

Arab Indonesians

Arab Indonesians are citizens of Indonesia. Their origin is Arab, and they are mainly from Hadrami. Until 1919, they were part of Dutch East Indies' law. Some people later gained economic power through real estate investment and trading. Currently, most of them can be found in Java and South Sumatra. They are almost all (generally orthodox) Muslims.
Indonesia has had contact with the Arab world for hundreds of years. This was even before the development of Islam in Indonesia. Most contact was with spice traders. The first Arab settlements in the archipelago may have started in the fifth century. These early communities took over much of the local culture. Some of them disappeared completely while others formed ethnic groups. 
Modern Arab Indonesians are descended from Hadramis, who came to Indonesia during the Dutch colonial period. The men often married native women. They were classified as "foreign orientals" along with Chinese Indonesians. This class stopped them from going to certain schools and also restricted their travel. They were also only allowed to live in special Arab districts, called "kampung Arab" in Indonesian. These laws were removed in 1919.
The community elites began to build economic power through trade and real estate investment. They bought large amounts of real estate in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta), Singapore and other parts of this area. Arab Indonesians did charity work, and built and protected their social capital. Eventually, some Arab Indonesians joined the "Volksraad", the people's council of the Dutch East Indies.
During the Indonesian National Awakening, Arab Indonesians began to oppose native Indonesians and the Dutch. This caused the formation of organizations which were only for Arab Indonesians in 1913. These organizations viewed the Arabian peninsula as their homeland. In 1934, Abdurrahman Baswedan founded an Arab Indonesian nationalistic movement, Persatoean Arab Indonesia.
Azyumardi Azra described Arab Indonesians as people who wish to remove local religious elements from Indonesian Islam. Indonesian critics of Arab influence in Indonesia point to the founding of the radical group Jemaah Islamiah (JI). Their leader is Laskar Jihad (LJ). After the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001 and the 2002 Bali bombing, the community came under suspicion.
First generation immigrants are called "wulāytī" or "totok". They are a small minority of the Arab Indonesian population. The majority, "muwallad" (plural form: "muwalladīn"), were born in Indonesia and may be of mixed heritage.
The majority of Arab Indonesians live on Java, mostly in East Java. Some live in South Sumatra.
Arab Indonesians are almost all Muslim. According to the 2000 census, 98.27 percent of Arab Indonesians are Muslim, compared to 88.22 percent of the whole population. Historically, most have lived in "kauman", or the area around mosques, but this has changed in recent years. The majority are Sunni, people who follow the Shafi'i school of Islamic law. The Shia are a growing minority. Children are often sent to madrasahs.
The Islam practiced by Arab Indonesians is more orthodox than the local, indigenous-influenced forms like "abangan". Many Arab Indonesians try to convince local Muslims to follow a more orthodox form of Islam as well.

Cuckoo (Mineral, Virginia)

Cuckoo is a Federal style house in the small unincorporated area Cuckoo, Virginia near Mineral, Virginia. The house was built in 1819 for Henry Pendleton. On August 19, 1994, Cuckoo was added to the list of National Register of Historic Places. The house is near the U.S. Route 33, which curves around the house. Cuckoo has Federal details and Colonial Revival elements from the early 20th century. The house is known for its design, prominence and its association with the Pendleton family of doctors. The house was named for the Cuckoo Tavern. The Pendleton family owns the house since its construction.
The first construction had a two storied front section with a one-story extension to the rear. The dining room and the winter kitchen were in the one-story section. Between 1839 and 1907 the house was owned by Dr. Philip Barbour Pendleton. He added a second floor to the rear part of the house and extended the main roof to cover the new rooms of the house. A later generation of Pendletons rebuilt the house in the Colonial Revival style after 1910. They added the present Neoclassical portico. The next owners, Anne Pendleton Forrest and Dr. William Mentzel Forrest, added to the back a design by architect Stanislaw J. Makielski of Charlottesville. The complex includes a number of outbuildings, including two separate doctor's office buildings, a garage, barn, a house for smoking, and the Pendleton family cemetery.
Cuckoo is a house made of bricks. It has two floors and a center-hall which is divided into three parts. Single rooms are flanking the stair hall. The house has a porch on its entire front. A semicircular closet with a small window is between the fireplaces of the rooms to the right of the center hall. The fireplaces and chimneys are on both sides of the elevation. The Makielski addition to the back of the house has a porch that echoes the curve of the closet. The addition includes a back stairway.
The small doctor's office was probably built in the early-to-mid 19th century for Dr. Robert Barret. It is to the north of Cuckoo, and was moved to Cuckoo by Dr. Philip Barbour Pendleton before the American Civil War. The large doctor's office was built around 1888 for Dr. Eugene Pendleton. It was expanded to also include his son's practice around 1908. It was moved to Cuckoo in 1910 when Eugene moved there. The office was moved again in 1972 when the highway was built, and was used as a medical office by Dr. Eugene Barbour Pendleton until 1979. A house for smoking was built in the late 19th century, and a barn in the early 20th century. A garage was built in the 1930s. 
The Pendleton cemetery is in an oak grove at the top of a small rise about 1/4 mile from the house. It is surrounded by a low stone wall. The cemetery has three gravestones and several unmarked graves.
Cuckoo was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 19, 1994. The house was damaged in the 2011 Virginia earthquake. The tall chimneys broke down.

Maria Anna of Austria

Maria Anna of Austria (Maria Anna Josepha; 7 September 1683 – 14 August 1754) was an Archduchess of Austria as she was a daughter of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. She would become Queen consort and regent of Portugal by her marriage to John V of Portugal. She was the Regent of Portugal from 1742 until 1750 during the illness of her spouse. In Portugal she was commonly known as "Mariana". 
The fifth of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperors children by Eleonore Magdalene of Neuburg, she was baptised "Maria Anna Josepha". She was born in Linz as the Austrian royal family had to flee Vienna from the Turkish army which destroyed the capital. Maria Anna was a sister of two future Holy Roman Emperors Joseph I and Charles VI. Through Charles VI, she was an aunt of Empress Maria Theresa. Her first cousins included Elisabetta Farnese as well as Charles II of Spain. 
On 27 October 1708 she married her first cousin John V of Portugal. Both of their mothers were sisters. Maria Anna thus became Queen of Portugal as the wife of the ruling king. She was the mother of six children:
In 1742 Maria Anna took over power as regent after her husband suffered a stroke, which left him partially paralyzed. When John V died on 31 July 1750 she gave up power to their eldest son Joseph I of Portugal. She died at he Palace of Belém in 1754. Her body was buried in Lisbon, her heart was brought to Vienna and buried there in the imperial crypt.

English poetry

The history of English poetry stretches from the middle of the 7th century to today. Over this period, English poets have written some of the longest-surviving poems in Western culture. The language and its poetry have spread around the world.
The earliest surviving poetry from the area now called England was probably transmitted orally (or passed from person to person by mouth, without being written down). It was then written down in versions that do not now survive. Because of this, it is difficult to say which poems were the earliest. There is a lot of controversy over this issue.
A number of major national poetries have developed. These include American, Australian, New Zealand, Canadian and Indian poetry. It may be controversial to describe Irish literature as English or British, even though it is in the English language.

Rearrangement reaction

A rearrangement reaction are organic reactions where the carbon skeleton of a molecule is rearranged. The result is a structural isomer of the original molecule. Often a substituent moves from one atom to another atom in the same molecule. In the example below, the substituent R moves from carbon atom 1 to carbon atom 2:
Intermolecular rearrangements also take place. 
Sometimes chemists draw diagrams with arrows that show how electrons are transferred between bonds during a rearrangement reaction. Many organic chemistry text books have such diagrams. But they do not tell the full story of the reaction mechanism. The actual mechanism of a rearrangement with an alkyl group moving is for the group to slide smoothly along a bond, not ionic bond-breaking and forming. One example of this is the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement:
In pericyclic reactions, the orbital interactions are important. The reactions can not be explained by a series of simple discrete electron transfers. But, the curved arrows showing a sequence of discrete electron transfers can give the same result as a rearrangement reaction. Yet, the diagrams are not necessarily realistic. In allylic rearrangement, the reaction is ionic.
Three important rearrangement reactions are 1,2-rearrangements, pericyclic reactions and olefin metathesis.
A 1,2-rearrangement is an organic reaction where a substituent moves from one atom to another atom in a chemical compound. In a 1,2 shift, the substituent moves between two adjacent atoms. But moves over larger distances are possible. Examples are the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement:
and the Beckmann rearrangement:
A pericyclic reaction is a type of reaction with multiple carbon-carbon bond making and breaking. The transition state of the molecule has a cyclic geometry. The reaction progresses in a concerted fashion. Examples are hydride shifts
and the Claisen rearrangement:
Olefin metathesis is a formal exchange of the alkylidene fragments in two alkenes. It is a catalytic reaction with carbene. It has transition metal carbene complex intermediates.

Computational chemistry

Computational chemistry is a branch of chemistry that uses computer science to help solve chemical problems. These programs calculate the structures and properties of molecules and solids. Computational chemistry normally complements the information obtained by chemical experiments. It can predict chemical phenomena that have not yet been observed. It is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials.
Computational chemistry can predict structure (that is, the expected positions of the molecule's atoms), absolute and relative (interaction) energies, electronic charge distributions, dipoles and higher multipole moments, vibrational frequencies, reactivity or other spectroscopic quantities, and cross sections for collision with other particles.
Computational chemistry looks at both static and dynamic systems. In all cases, as the size of the system being studied grows, the computer time and other resources (such as memory and disk space) used also grows. That system can be a single molecule, a group of molecules, or a solid. Computational chemistry methods range from highly accurate to very approximate. Highly accurate methods are typically feasible only for small systems.

Polymer chemistry

Polymer chemistry (also called macromolecular chemistry) is the science of chemical synthesis and chemical properties of polymers or macromolecules. According to IUPAC recommendations, macromolecules refer to the individual molecular chains and are the domain of chemistry. Polymers describe the bulk properties of polymer materials and belong to the field of polymer physics (a part of physics).
The different kinds of macromolecules include:
Polymers are formed by polymerization of monomers. Chemists describe a polymer by its degree of polymerization, molar mass distribution, tacticity, copolymer distribution, the degree of branching, by its end-groups, crosslinks, and crystallinity. Chemists also study a polymer's thermal properties such as its glass transition temperature and melting temperature. Polymers in solution have special characteristics for solubility, viscosity and gelation.
Polymer chemistry started by studying the long fibers in plants. The work of Henri Braconnot in 1777 and the work of Christian Schönbein in 1846 led to the discovery of nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose treated with camphor makes celluloid. Chemists dissolve celluloid in ether or acetone to make collodion. Doctors have used collodion as a wound dressing since the U.S. Civil War. Cellulose acetate was first prepared in 1865. In 1834, Friedrich Ludersdorf and Nathaniel Hayward independently discovered that adding sulfur to raw natural rubber (polyisoprene) helped prevent the material from becoming sticky. In 1844 Charles Goodyear received a U.S. patent for vulcanizing rubber with sulfur and heat. Thomas Hancock had received a patent for the same process in the UK the year before.
In 1884, Hilaire de Chardonnet started the first artificial fiber factory based on regenerated cellulose, or viscose rayon, as a substitute for silk, but it was very flammable. In 1907 Leo Baekeland invented the first synthetic polymer, a thermosetting phenol-formaldehyde resin called Bakelite. Around the same time, Hermann Leuchs reported the synthesis of N-carboxyanhydrides and their high molecular weight products upon reaction with nucleophiles. But Leuchs did not call them polymers, possibly due to the strong views held by Emil Fischer, his direct supervisor, denying the possibility of any covalent molecule exceeding 6,000 daltons. Cellophane was invented in 1908 by Jocques Brandenberger who squirted sheets of viscose rayon into an acid bath.
In 1922, Hermann Staudinger (a German chemist) proposed that polymers were long chains of atoms held together by covalent bonds. He also proposed to name these compounds "macromolecules". Before that, scientists believed that polymers were clusters of small molecules (called colloids), without definite molecular weights, held together by an unknown force. Staudinger received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1953.
Wallace Carothers invented the first synthetic rubber called neoprene in 1931. Neoprene was the first polyester. Carothers went on to invent nylon, a true silk replacement, in 1935. Paul Flory was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 for his work on polymer random coil configurations in solution in the 1950s. Stephanie Kwolek developed an aramid, or aromatic nylon named Kevlar, patented in 1966.
There are now a large number of commercial polymers. They include composite materials such as carbon fiber-epoxy, polystyrene-polybutadiene (HIPS), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS). Chemists design commercial polymers to combine the best properties of their various components. For example, special polymers used in automobile engines are designed to work at high temperatures.
It took a long time before universities introduced teaching and research programs in polymer chemistry. 
An "Institut fur Makromolekulare Chemie was founded in 1940 in Freiburg, Germany under the direction of Hermann Staudinger. In America a "Polymer Research Institute" (PRI) was established in 1941 by Herman Mark at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now Polytechnic Institute of NYU). Several hundred graduates of PRI played an important role in the US polymer industry and academia. Other PRI's were founded in 1961 by Richard S. Stein at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 1967 by Eric Baer at Case Western Reserve University and in 1988 at the University of Akron.

Chemical synthesis

In chemistry, chemical synthesis means using chemical reactions to get a product, or several products. This happens by physical and chemical manipulations. Often, several different chemical reactions are used; one after another. In modern laboratory usage, a chemical synthesis is reproducible (if the experiment is done a second time, it will have the same results as the first time), reliable (not broken by small changes in conditions), and established to work in multiple laboratories.
Chemists start to design a chemical synthesis by selecting compounds to combine. These starting compounds are known as reagents or reactants. Chemists use various reaction types to these to synthesize the product, or an intermediate product. This requires mixing the compounds in a reaction vessel. (The vessel can be a chemical reactor or a simple round-bottom flask.) Many reactions require some form of work-up procedure before the final product is isolated.
The amount of product in a chemical synthesis is the reaction yield. Typically, chemical yields are expressed as a weight in grams or as a percentage of the total theoretical quantity of product that could be produced. A side reaction is an unwanted chemical reaction taking place that reduces the yield of the wanted product.
The chemist Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe was the first to use the word "synthesis" in its present-day meaning.
In most cases, a single reaction will not convert a reactant (starting chemical) into the desired reaction product. Chemists have many strategies to find the best sequence of reactions to make the desired product. In cascade reactions multiple chemical changes take place within a single reactant. In multi-component reactions up to 11 different reactants form a single reaction product. In a telescopic synthesis, one reactant goes through multiple transformations without isolating intermediates after each step.
Organic synthesis is a special type of chemical synthesis. Only organic compounds are created in organic synthesis. The total synthesis of a complex product may take many steps to reach the goal product. These steps can take too much time. Chemists want to have skill in organic synthesis and being able to find a synthesis path with the least number of steps. The synthesis of very valuable or difficult compounds has earned chemists, such as Robert Burns Woodward, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
If a chemical synthesis starts from basic laboratory compounds and yields something new, it is a "purely synthetic process". If it starts from a product isolated from plants or animals and then proceeds to a new compounds, the synthesis is called a "semisynthetic process".
Most times, chemical synthesis means the overall, many step procedure for making a desired product. Sometimes, chemists use "chemical synthesis" to mean just a "direct combination reaction". In a direct combination reaction, two or more reactants combine to form a single product. The chemical equation for a direct combination reaction is:
where A and B are elements or compounds, and AB is a compound consisting of A and B. Examples of combination reactions include:
Four special synthesis rules are:

Organic synthesis

Organic synthesis is a special part of chemical synthesis. It builds organic compounds using organic reactions. Organic molecules can have a higher level of complexity compared to inorganic compounds. So, the synthesis of organic compounds has developed into one of the most important parts of organic chemistry. There are two main areas of research fields within the general area of organic synthesis: "total synthesis" and "methodology".
A total synthesis is the complete chemical synthesis of complex organic molecules from simple, commercially available (petrochemical) or natural precursors. In a "linear" synthesis—often used for simple structures—several steps are performed one after another until the molecule is complete. The chemical compounds made in each step are usually called "synthetic intermediates". For more complex molecules, a different approach may be preferable: convergent synthesis involves the individual preparation of several "pieces" (key intermediates), which are then combined to form the goal product.
Robert Burns Woodward, who received the 1965 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for several total syntheses (for example, his 1954 synthesis of strychnine), is regarded as the father of modern organic synthesis. Some latter-day examples of total synthesis include Wender's, Holton's, Nicolaou's and Danishefsky's synthesis of Taxol.
Each step of a synthesis involves a chemical reaction, and reagents and conditions for each of these reactions need to be designed to give a good yield and a pure product, with as little work as possible. A method may already exist in the literature for making one of the early synthetic intermediates, and this method will usually be used rather than "trying to reinvent the wheel". However most intermediates are compounds that have never been made before. These will normally be made using general methods developed by methodology researchers. To be useful, these methods need to give high yields. They must also be reliable for a broad range of substrates. For practical applications, additional requirements include industrial standards of safety and purity. Methodology research usually involves three main stages: "discovery", "optimization", and studies of "scope and limitations". The "discovery" requires extensive knowledge of and experience with chemical reactivities of appropriate reagents. "Optimization" is where one or two starting compounds are tested in the reaction under a wide variety of conditions of temperature, solvent, reaction time, etc. Researchers try different conditions until they find the best conditions for product yield and purity. Finally, researchers try to extend the synthesis method to a broad range of different starting materials, to find its scope and limitations. Total synthesis (see above) are sometimes used to highlight the new method and demonstrate its value in a real-world application. Major industries focused especially on polymers (and plastics) and on pharmaceuticals have used this research.
Most complex natural products are chiral. Each enantiomer can have a different bioactivity. Traditional total syntheses targeted racemic mixtures, i.e., as an equal mixture of both possible enantiomers. The racemic mixture might then be separated via chiral resolution.
In the latter half of the twentieth century, chemists began to develop methods of asymmetric catalysis and kinetic resolution. These reactions could be directed to produce only one enantiomer rather than a racemic mixture. Early examples include Sharpless epoxidation (K. Barry Sharpless) and asymmetric hydrogenation (William S. Knowles and Ryōji Noyori). For their achievement, these workers went on to share the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2001. Such reactions gave chemists a much wider choice of enantiomerically pure molecules to start an organic synthesis. Previously only natural enantiomer starting materials could be used. Using techniques pioneered by Robert Burns Woodward and other new synthetic methods, chemists became more able to make complex molecules without unwanted racemisation. This is called stereocontrol. This allowed the final target molecule to be synthesised as one pure enantiomer without any resolution being necessary. Such techniques are referred to as asymmetric synthesis.
Elias James Corey brought a more formal approach to synthesis design, based on retrosynthetic analysis, for which he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1990. In this approach, the research is planned backwards from the product, using standard rules. The steps are shown using retrosynthetic arrows (drawn as =>), which in effect means "is made from". Computer programs have been written for designing a synthesis based on sequences of generic "half-reactions".

Gali Akish

ALI AKISH (January 14, 1918, Hailar, China - July 17, 2011, Ankara, Turkey) is a famous journalist, one of the leaders of the Tatar nationalist movement, the Honorary President of the World League of Tatars.
Ali Aksih was a preeminent leader of the Tatar nationalist movement in diaspora. He was born in the city of Hailar (Manchuria), where he attended a local Tatar elementary school before entering a Russian lycee. After completing the lycee in 1936, he went to study at Al-Azhar University in Cairo (Egypt), and in 1938, along with another young nationalist, Ahat Ginish, went to Poland. Akish and Ginish served as technical assistants to Ayaz Iskhaki at the Idel-Ural National Center, where the newspaper “Yanga Milli Yul" (New National Path) was published. Their work was interrupted by the invasion of Poland by the Nazi and Soviet forces.
Akish lived from 1940 to 1966 in Turkey where he was involved with the diaspora national movement. His pamphlet “Problems of Idel-Ural and Soviet Imperialism” printed in 1963 received great attention and provoked repercussions in the USSR in the form of two books, one ostensibly written by the President of the Tatar ASSR, Salikh Batiyev in 1977. In 1966 Ali Akish joined the Tatar-Bashkir Service of Radio Liberty, Inc. In 1983, he retired from this position and went again to Ankara. Over the years he wrote numerous articles in emigree publications and other forums such as Turk Kulturu, and in 1985 published a 59 page booklet, similar to his first, called "Idel-Ural'da Hurriyet Mucadelesi" (Struggle for Freedom in Idel-Ural).
In 1994, after reading Vladimir Zhirinovsky's book "Last Thrust to the South," he wrote an article for the Turkish newspaper "Milliyet" in which he denounced the Russian nationalists' imperial and anti-Turkish aspirations. The article was highly significant as one of the first published in Turkey critical of Zhirinovsky and his views.
He was able to visit Kazan, the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan in Russia. On his first visit to Kazan he brought, at his own expense, a computer that he donated to the Tatar Public Center. Akish dedicated his whole life to the liberation of the Tatar people from colonial oppression. The World Tatar League named him honorary president in recognition of his achievements. A school was named in his honor in the city of Chally (Naberezhniye Chelny) in Tatarstan.

Yield (chemistry)

In chemistry, yield (also called chemical yield or reaction yield) is the amount of product resulting from a chemical reaction. The "absolute yield" gives the weight in grams, and the "molar yield" gives the number of moles.
The "fractional yield", "relative yield", or "percentage yield" shows how completely a synthetic procedure worked. It is calculated by dividing the amount of product by the "theoretical yield" (the unit of measurement for both must be the same):
formula_1
To get the "percentage yield", one must multiply the fractional yield by 100% (e.g., 0.673 × 100% = 67.3%).
The ideal percentage yield of a chemical reaction is 100%, but it cannot be achieved because measurements are never completely accurate. Yields around 100% are "quantitative", yields above 90% are "excellent", yields above 80% are "very good", yields above 70% are "good", yields below 50% are "fair",however yields below 40% are "poor".

Dry cleaning

Dry cleaning (or dry-cleaning) is any cleaning process for clothing and textiles using a chemical solvent (a chemical that can dissolve certain compounds) rather than water. The solvent used is usually tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene). The solvent is called "perc" in the industry and "dry-cleaning fluid" by the public. It is often used instead of hand washing delicate fabrics. People use dry cleaning because it takes less work than hand washing.
The ancient Romans used a chemical called ammonia (derived from urine) and fuller's earth (a clay that can absorb grease and oil.) to clean their woolen togas. "Fullonicae" were very famous, with at least one in every town of any notability, and frequently the largest employer in a district. These laundries got their urine from farm animals, or from special pots situated at public bathrooms. The workforce made so much money that fuller's guilds (a group that works in solely one job, in this case, making fuller's earth, this special clay.) were an important political force. Also, the government taxed the collection of urine.
Modern dry cleaning uses solvents that do not use water to remove dirt and stains from clothing. Jean Baptiste Jolly discovered that petroleum-based solvents (chemicals based on fuel like gasoline or kerosene.) can be used for dry-cleaning in the mid-19th century. Jolly was a French dye-works owner. He noticed that his tablecloth became cleaner after his maid spilled kerosene on it. Because of this, he developed a service cleaning people's clothes this way, which became known as "nettoyage à sec," or "dry cleaning".
Early dry cleaners used petroleum-based solvents, such as gasoline (petrol) and kerosene. Fire concerns led William Joseph Stoddard, a dry cleaner from Atlanta, to develop Stoddard solvent as a slightly less flammable alternative to gasoline-based solvents. The government started to control dry cleaners because the highly flammable petroleum solvents caused many fires and explosions.
After World War I, dry cleaners began using chlorinated solvents. These solvents were much less flammable than petroleum solvents and had improved cleaning power. By the mid-1930s, the dry cleaning industry had adopted tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene), widely called "perc," as the best solvent. It has excellent cleaning power and is stable, nonflammable, and gentle to most clothing. However, perc was also the first chemical to be classified as a carcinogen (a chemical that can cause cancer.) by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (a classification later withdrawn). In 1993, the California Air Resources Board adopted regulations to reduce perc emissions from dry cleaning operations. The dry cleaning industry is in the process of replacing perc with other chemicals and/or methods.
Traditionally, the actual cleaning process was carried out at centralized "factories"; high street cleaners shops received garments from customers, sent them to the factory, and then had them returned to the shop, where the customer could collect them. This was due mainly to the risk of fire or dangerous fumes created by the cleaning process. At this time, dry-cleaning was carried out in two different machines — one for the cleaning process itself and the second to dry the clothing.
Machines of this era were called "vented"; their fumes and drying exhausts were sent into the air, in the same way as with modern tumble dryer exhausts. This added to environmental contamination. Also much potentially reusable perc was lost to the atmosphere. Much stricter controls on solvent emissions have ensured that all dry cleaning machines in the western world are now fully enclosed. No solvent fumes are vented to the atmosphere. In enclosed machines, solvent recovered during the drying process is returned condensed and distilled. So, it can be reused to clean further loads, or safely thrown away. The majority of modern enclosed machines also incorporate a computer-controlled drying sensor, which automatically feels when most traces of perc have been removed from the load during the drying process. This system ensures that only the smallest amount of perc fumes will be released when opening the door at the end of the cycle.
A dry-cleaning machine is similar to a combination of a domestic washing machine, and clothes dryer. Garments are placed into a washing/extraction chamber (referred to as the basket, or drum). The chamber is the core of the machine. The washing chamber contains a horizontal, perforated drum that rotates within an outer shell. The shell holds the solvent while the rotating drum holds the clothing. The basket can hold between about 10 and 40 kg (20 to 80 lb).
During the wash cycle, the chamber is filled approximately one-third full of solvent and begins to rotate, agitating the clothing. The solvent temperature is maintained at 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), as a higher temperature may damage it. During the wash cycle, the solvent in the chamber is filtered and then fed back into the chamber. This is known as the cycle and is continued for the wash duration. The solvent is then removed and sent to a distillation unit that has both a boiler and condenser. The condensed solvent is fed into a separator unit where any remaining water is separated from the solvent and then fed into the 'clean solvent' tank. The ideal flow rate is one gallon of solvent per pound of garments (roughly 8 litres of solvent per kilogram of clothing) per minute, depending on the size of the machine.
Operators also check clothing for foreign objects before placing them into the machine. Items such as plastic pens will dissolve in the solvent bath and may damage textiles beyond recovery. Some textile dyes are "loose" (red being the main problem), and will release dye during solvent immersion. Operators will dry clean red clothing separately from lighter-color textiles to avoid color transfer. The solvent used must be distilled to remove impurities that may transfer to clothing. Operators checked clothing for dry-cleaning compatibility, including fasteners. Many fasteners that decorate clothing either are not dry cleaning solvent proof or will not withstand the mechanical action of cleaning. Operators will remove them and restitched them after the cleaning. Or, operators will wrap them in a small padded protector. Fragile items, such as feather bedspreads or tasseled rugs or hangings, may be enclosed in a loose mesh bag. The density of perchloroethylene is around 1.7 g/cm³ at room temperature (70% heavier than water), and the sheer weight of absorbed solvent may cause the textile to fail under normal force during the extraction cycle unless the mesh bag provides mechanical support.
Many people believe that all marks or stains can be removed by dry cleaning. Not every stain can be cleaned just by dry cleaning. Some need to be treated with spotting solvents; sometimes by steam jet or by soaking in special stain remover liquids before garments are washed or dry cleaned. Also, garments stored in soiled condition for a long time are difficult to bring back to their original color and texture. Natural fibers such as wool, cotton, and silk of lighter colors should not be left in dirty or soiled condition for long amounts of time as they absorb dirt in their texture and are unlikely to be restored to their original color and finish.
The main reason that washing in water has a different result than dry cleaning is that water is a polar solvent while dry cleaning uses a non-polar solvent.
A typical wash cycle lasts for 8–15 minutes depending on the type of garments and degree of soiling. During the first three minutes, solvent-soluble soils dissolve into the perchloroethylene and loose, insoluble soil comes off. It takes approximately ten to twelve minutes after the loose soil has come off to remove the ground-in insoluble soil from garments. Machines using hydrocarbon solvents require a wash cycle of at least 25 minutes because of the much slower rate of solvation of solvent-soluble soils. A dry-cleaning surfactant "soap" may also be added.
At the end of the wash cycle, the machine starts a rinse cycle wherein the garment load is rinsed with fresh distilled solvent from the pure solvent tank. This pure solvent rinse prevents discoloration caused by soil particles being absorbed back onto the garment surface from the "dirty" working solvent.
After the rinse cycle, the machine begins the extraction process, which recovers dry-cleaning solvent for reuse. Modern machines recover approximately 99.99% of the solvent that was used. The extraction cycle begins by draining the solvent from the washing chamber and accelerating the basket to 350 to 450 rpm, causing much of the solvent to spin free of the fabric. Until this time the cleaning is done in normal temperature, the solvent is never heated in dry cleaning process. When no more solvent can be spun out, the machine starts the drying cycle.
During the drying cycle, the garments are tumbled in a stream of warm air (60-63°C/140-145°F) that circulates through the basket, evaporating any traces of solvent left after the spin cycle. The air temperature is controlled to prevent heat damage to the garments. The exhausted warm air from the machine then passes through a chiller unit where solvent vapors are condensed and returned to the distilled solvent tank. Modern dry cleaning machines use a closed-loop system in which the chilled air is reheated and recirculated. This results in high solvent recovery rates and reduced air pollution. In the early days of dry cleaning, large amounts of perchlorethylene were vented to the atmosphere because it was regarded as cheap and believed to be harmless.
After the drying cycle is complete, a deodorizing (aeration) cycle cools the garments and removes even more of the solvent, by circulating cool outside air over the garments and then through a vapor recovery filter made from activated carbon and polymer resins. After the aeration cycle, the garments are clean and ready for pressing/finishing.
In fact, dry cleaning does not remove all of the solvent. There are no government standards for how much solvent is allowed to remain in the fabric. Detectable amounts of the solvent remain in clothes, with wool clothes retaining the most solvent.
Working solvent from the washing chamber passes through several filtration steps before it is returned to the washing chamber. The first step is a button trap, which prevents small objects such as lint, fasteners, buttons, and coins from entering the solvent pump.
Over time, a thin layer of filter cake (called muck) accumulates on the lint filter. The muck is removed regularly (commonly once per day) and then processed to recover solvent trapped in the muck. Many machines use "spin disc filters," which remove the muck from the filter by centrifugal force while it is back washed with solvent.
After the lint filter, the solvent passes through an absorptive cartridge filter. This filter is made from activated clays and charcoal and removes fine insoluble soil and non-volatile residues, along with dyes from the solvent. Finally, the solvent passes through a polishing filter, which removes any soil not previously removed. The clean solvent is then returned to the working solvent tank.
To enhance cleaning power, small amounts of detergent (0.5%-1.5%) are added to the working solvent and are essential to its functionality. These detergents help dissolve hydrophilic soils and keep soil from redepositing on garments. Depending on the machine's design, either an anionic or a cationic detergent is used.
Since the solvent recovery is less than 100%, and because dry-cleaning does not remove water-based stains well, entrepreneurs have developed the wet cleaning process, which is, in essence, cold-water washing and air drying, using a computer-controlled washer and dryer. In general, wet cleaning is still being improved and developed, although low-tech versions of it have been used for centuries.
People who make clothes have special symbols to say how they should be cleaned. The international GINETEX laundry symbol for dry cleaning is a circle. It may have a letter P inside to indicate perchloroethylene solvent, or a letter F inside to indicate a hydrocarbon solvent. A bar underneath the circle means that only mild cleaning processes should be used. A crossed-out empty circle means the clothes should not be dry cleaned.
Cooked Powder Residue — the waste material generated by cooking down or distilling muck. Cooked powder residue is a hazardous waste and will contain solvent, powdered filter material (diatomite), carbon, non-volatile residues, lint, dyes, grease, soils, and water. Laws say how this material can be discarded.
The waste sludge or solid residue from the still contains solvent, water, soils, carbon, and other non-volatile residues. Material removed from the bottom of the stills at chlorinated solvent dry cleaning operations are hazardous wastes.
Perc is classified as a hazardous air contaminant by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and must be handled as a hazardous waste. To prevent it from getting into drinking water, dry cleaners that use perc must take special precautions against site contamination. Landlords are becoming increasingly reluctant to allow dry cleaners to operate in their buildings. When released into the air, perc can contribute to smog when it reacts with other volatile organic carbon substances. California declared perchloroethylene a toxic chemical in 1991, and its use will become illegal in that state in 2023.
Some alternatives such as CO avoids the toxic risks of perc. But, CO does not clean some forms of grime as well as perc.
Various commercial products on the marketplace today, such as Procter & Gamble's Dryel, allow elements of the dry cleaning process to be performed in the household using home laundry machines. Though not the complete process that would be performed by a professional dry cleaner, they allow the convenience of home laundry and work for certain types of garments.

Evolution of cetaceans

The Cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) are mammalian marine descendants of land mammals. Their terrestrial origins are indicated by:
The question of how land animals evolved into ocean-going leviathans was a mystery until recent discoveries in Pakistan revealed several stages in the transition of cetaceans from land to sea.
After many years when palaeontologists thought whales had evolved from mesonychids, DNA sequence analysis showed the closest relationship was with artiodactyls, the even-toed ungulates. A new clade was created to include Cetacea and their nearest relatives, the hippopotamus family. This clade is called the Cetartiodactyla.
Hippo fossils are not found until the Miocene, but whale ancestors have been found from the Eocene. This leaves a gap of nearly 30 million years where no hippo ancestors are found. The most recent hypothesis is that hippos and whales shared a common semi-aquatic ancestor which branched off from other Artiodactyls around 60 million years ago (mya). This ancestral group probably split into two branches around 54 mya. One branch evolved into cetaceans, possibly beginning with the proto-whale "Pakicetus" from 52 mya. These early cetaceans gradually became adapted to life in the sea. They became the completely aquatic cetaceans. 
"Indohyus" is a small deer-like creature, which lived about 48 million years ago in Kashmir. It belongs to the artiodactyls family "Raoellidae", and is believed to be the closest sister group of Cetacea. 
About the size of a raccoon or domestic cat, this herbivorous creature shared some of the traits of whales. It also showed signs of adaptations to aquatic life, including a thick and heavy outer bone coating. This is similar to the bones of modern creatures such as the hippopotamus, and reduces buoyancy so that they can stay underwater. This suggests a similar survival strategy to the African mousedeer or water chevrotain which, when threatened by a bird of prey, dives into water and hides beneath the surface for up to four minutes.

Coal ball

Coal balls are permineralised life forms that are full of calcium. They generally have a round shape. Coal balls are not made of coal, even though they have the name "coal ball". 
In 1855, two English scientists, Joseph Dalton Hooker and Edward William Binney, found coal balls in England. Because of that, the initial research on coal balls was done in Europe. Coal balls were found and identified in North America in 1922. Since then, coal balls have been found in other countries and several theories on their formation have been proposed.
Marie Stopes and D.M.S. Watson also examined coal ball samples. They agreed that coal balls formed "in situ". They also added that interaction with a marine environment was necessary for a coal ball to form.
Coal balls are in coal seams across North America and Eurasia. North American coal balls are in more places than in Europe. The oldest coal balls were found in Germany and former Czechoslovakia.
In 1962, Sergius Mamay and Ellis Yochelson found signs of marine animal remains in North American coal balls. 
The quality of the preservation of organic material depends on the speed of the burial process and the degree of compression before undergoing permineralisation. Generally, coal balls resulting from remains that have a quick burial with little decay and pressure have a higher preservation degree. However, plant remains in most coal balls show various signs of decay and collapse.
Thin sectioning was an early procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls. The ball was cut into thin sections with a diamond saw. Then it was flattened and polished with an abrasive. Then it was examined under a microscope. This is the procedure which was carried out by Hooker and Binney. The time needed, and the poor quality of samples produced, led to a more convenient method.
The new method, first used in 1928, is called the "liquid peel technique".

Paul Flory

Paul John Flory (June 19, 1910 – September 9, 1985) was an American chemist and Nobel laureate. He worked in the field of polymers, or macromolecules. He was a leading pioneer in understanding how polymers dissolve in solutions. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 "for his fundamental achievements, both theoretical and experimental, in the physical chemistry of macromolecules."
He graduated from Elgin High School in Elgin, Illinois in 1927. Flory received a bachelor's degree from Manchester College (Indiana) in 1931 and a Ph.D. from the Ohio State University in 1934. His first position was at DuPont with Wallace Carothers.
Flory's earliest work in polymer science was in the area of polymerization kinetics at the DuPont Experimental station. Most chemists studying condensation polymerization believed that the reactivity of the end group decreased as the macromolecule grew. Flory argued that the reactivity was independent of the polymer's size. He showed that the number of polymer chains present decreased with size exponentially.
Flory introduced the important concept of chain transfer to the study of addition polymerization. This improved chemists' understanding of the kinetic equations. It also helped chemists to understand the distribution of the polymer sizes.
In 1938, after Carothers' death, Flory moved to the Basic Science Research Laboratory at the University of Cincinnati. There he developed a mathematical theory for the polymerization of compounds with more than two functional groups. He also developed the theory of polymer networks or gels.
In 1940, he joined the Linden, NJ laboratory of the Standard Oil Development Company. He developed a statistical mechanical theory for polymer mixtures there.
In 1943, he left to join the research laboratories of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company as head of a group on polymer fundamentals. In the Spring of 1948 Peter Debye, then chairman of the chemistry department at Cornell University, invited Flory to give the annual Baker Lectures. He then was offered a position with the faculty in the Fall of the same year. At Cornell, Flory expanded and refined his Baker Lectures into his best work (magnum opus), "Principles of Polymer Chemistry" which was published in 1953 by Cornell University Press. This quickly became a standard text for all workers in the field of polymers, and is still widely used to this day.
Flory introduced the concept of excluded volume to polymers. (Werner Kuhn had already invented the term in 1934 for molecules in general.) "Excluded volume" refers to the idea that one part of a long chain molecule can not occupy space that is already occupied by another part of the same molecule. Excluded volume causes the ends of a polymer chain in a solution to be further apart (on average) than they would be were there no excluded volume. The recognition that excluded volume was an important factor in analyzing long-chain molecules in solutions provided an important conceptual breakthrough. Excluded volume explained several puzzling experimental results of that time. It also led to the concept of the theta point, the set of conditions at which an experiment can be conducted that causes the excluded volume effect to be neutralized. At the theta point, the chain reverts to ideal chain characteristics - the long-range interactions coming from the excluded volume are eliminated. This allows experimenters to more easily measure short-range features such as structural geometry, bond rotation potentials, and steric interactions between near-neighboring groups. Flory taught another advantage of performing the experiment at the theta point: the chain dimension in polymer melts would have the size computed for a chain in ideal solution. This works because excluded volume interactions are neutralized at the theta point.
He also invented an original method for computing the probable size of a polymer in good solution. He invented the Flory-Huggins Solution Theory. He derived the Flory exponent, which helps characterize the movement of polymers in solution.
Flory won the Perkin Medal and the Priestley Medal.
In modeling the position vectors of atoms in macromolecules it is often necessary to convert from Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) to generalized coordinates. The Flory convention for defining the variables involved is usually employed. For an example, a peptide bond can be described by the x,y,z positions of every atom in this bond or the Flory convention can be used. Here one must know the bond lengths formula_1, bond angles formula_2, and the dihedral angles formula_3. A three-dimensional structure can be described using the Flory convention by applying a vector conversion from the Cartesian coordinates to the generalized coordinates.
He became a professor at Stanford University in 1961. He became the Jackson-Wood Professor there in 1966. He retired from Stanford in 1975. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 "for his fundamental achievements, both theoretical and experimental, in the physical chemistry of macromolecules." He remained active after his retirement, and consulted for IBM for some years. He and his wife Emily Catherine Tabor (now dead) had three children, Susan, Melinda and John. Susan has two children, Elizabeth and Mary. Elizabeth has three children, Katy Greer, Margaret Greer, and Sam Greer. Paul J Flory died of a heart attack in Big Sur, California in 1985.

Informal economy

The informal economy is that part of economy which does not show up in official statistics. The informal economy is not taxed, and does not contribute to the gross domestic product of a country. In developing countries over 70% of the people work in this form of economy. They are self-employed, because it is difficult to find someone to hire them. The people working in this form of economy have no social benefits or social security, which are usually only given by the state to those who have made tax contributions. 
Usually, most people working in this form of economy are women; they work in the most erratic and corrupt segments of the job market.
Sixty percent of female workers in developing countries are employed by the informal sector. There are two main reasons why this is the case: First, the kind of employment that is available caters most to women. Secondly, most women either work from home, because they also have to take care of children, or they work as street vendors; both of these kinds of work are classified in the informal sector. 
What is more, most people at the top positions of the sector are men, and most people in the bottom positions are women.
For example, very few women are employers who hire others and more women are likely to be involved in smaller scale operations. Labor markets, household decisions, and states all propagate this gender inequality. The gender gap in terms of wage is even higher in the informal sector than the formal sector.

The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 movie)

The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a 1996 American animated movie made by Walt Disney Feature Animation and first released to movie theaters on June 21, 1996 by Walt Disney Pictures and Buena Vista Pictures. The movie is the thirty-fourth movie in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, and is inspired by Victor Hugo's classic novel "Notre Dame de Paris" ("The Hunchback of Notre-Dame"). The story is about Quasimodo, the deformed bellringer of Notre Dame.
The movie is directed by Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale, directors of "Beauty and the Beast", and produced by Don Hahn, producer of "Beauty and the Beast" and "The Lion King". The songs for the movie were composed by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, and the movie features the voices of Tom Hulce, Demi Moore, Kevin Kline, Paul Kandel, Jason Alexander, Charles Kimbrough, David Ogden Stiers, Tony Jay, and Mary Wickes. The movie received a G rating by the Motion Picture Association of America, and was rated U by the British Board of Film Classification in the UK. But despite these ratings, the movie is considered to be one of Disney's darkest animated movies similar to movies such as "The Black Cauldron".

Sorption

When two chemical substances come in contact with each other, through what is called a phase, they will interact with each other in that phase. They may also have an interface. If a substance accumulates within a phase this is called absorption, if the same process happens on the interface, it is called adsorption. In the year 1909, James William McBain introduced the word Sorption to describe such a process, in the case where it is not easy or meaningful to make a difference between absorption and absorption. 
Examples of where the concept of sorption is important are measuring the pollution of the environment; using sorption it is possible to bind pollutants to small particles in the air (called aerosols), or in the soil (where they bind to colloids). Sorption makes these bindings possible. In much the same way, polluants can be transported over long distances. 
Machines and processes that use sorption include the absorption refrigerator and solar air conditioning.

Materials science

Materials science studies the properties of matter to solve science and engineering problems. It uses applied physics and chemistry. Supersmall nanotechnology has got attention in recent years. There are many inventions of new material. Work on why structures fail or break down is very important to engineering.
The important material of a given era is often its defining point. Examples are the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age.
Materials science originally studied ceramics and metallurgy. These ancient crafts make materials science one of the oldest forms of engineering and applied science. A major breakthrough in the understanding of materials occurred in the late 19th century, when the American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs showed that the physical properties of a material were related to its atomic structure. As the phases changed, so did the physical properties of the material. 
Important elements of modern materials science are a product of the space race: the understanding and engineering of the metallic alloys, and silica and carbon materials, used in the construction of space exploration vehicles. 
Materials science is now linked to the development of plastics, semiconductors, ceramics, polymers, magnetic materials, medical implant materials and biological materials.
The material scientist/engineer also deals with the extraction of materials and their conversion into useful forms. So, ingot casting, foundry techniques, blast furnace extraction, and electrolytic extraction are all part of the required knowledge of a metallurgist/engineer. Often the presence, absence or variation of minute quantities of secondary elements and compounds in a bulk material will have a great impact on the final properties of the materials produced, for instance, steels are classified based on 1/10 and 1/100 weight percentages of the carbon and other alloying elements they contain. Thus, the extraction and purification techniques employed in the extraction of iron in the blast furnace will have an impact of the quality of steel that may be produced.
The study of disasters in the 19th and 20th century led to some important discoveries. A.A. Griffith (1893–1963) discovered that real materials never get near their theoretical strength. This was a groundbreaking discovery which led to changes in many industries. As an example, steel gets almost 1/10th of its theoretical strength, but most solids are 100 to 1000 times weaker than expected.
Griffith's insights were developed further by J.E. Gordon (1913–1998). Gordon said that all simple solids are by their nature brittle. Toughness – resistance to fracture – has to be designed into materials. The usual way is to add other material to the pure substance. This makes its structure more complex, and that makes it less likely to fail. A good example is bulletproof glass, where a plastic layer stuck to glass make it many times stronger than either material would be separately. The personal armour based on Kevlar is another example. Biological materials have this feature naturally. Bones do bend a little before they reach breaking point, and tree trunks also have some "give".
The industrial study of metal alloys is a large part of materials science. Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of iron (steel, stainless steel, cast iron, tool steel, alloy steels) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low, mid and high carbon steels. An iron carbon alloy is only considered steel if the carbon level is between 0.01% and 2.00%. For the steels, the hardness and tensile strength of the steel is related to the amount of carbon present. Increasing carbon levels leads to lower ductility and toughness. Heat treatment processes such as quenching and tempering can significantly change these properties however. Cast Iron is defined as an Iron-Carbon alloy with more than 2.00% but less than 6.67% carbon. Stainless steel is defined as a regular steel alloy with greater than 10% by weight alloying content of chromium. Nickel and molybdenum are also found in stainless steels.
Other significant metallic alloys are those of aluminium, titanium, copper and magnesium. Copper alloys have been known for a long time (since the Bronze Age), while the alloys of the other three metals have been relatively recently developed. Due to the chemical reactivity of these metals, the electrolytic extraction processes required were only developed relatively recently. The alloys of aluminium, titanium and magnesium are also known and valued for their high strength-to-weight ratios and, in the case of magnesium, their ability to provide electromagnetic shielding. These materials are ideal for situations where high strength-to-weight ratios are more important than bulk cost, such as in the aerospace industry and certain automotive engineering applications.
Polymers are also an important part of materials science. They are the raw materials used to make what we commonly call plastics. Plastics are really the final product. They are made when polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing. The mixture is then shaped into a final form. Common polymers are, include polyethylene, polypropylene, PVC, polystyrene, nylons, polyesters, acrylics, polyurethanes, and polycarbonates. 
PVC (polyvinyl-chloride) is widely used, inexpensive, and annual production quantities are large. It lends itself to an incredible array of uses, from artificial leather to electrical insulation and cabling, packaging and containers. It is simple to make. It accepts a wide range of plasticisers and other additives, which give it differing properties.
Another application of the material sciences is the structures of glass and ceramics, typically associated with the most brittle materials. Ceramics and glasses use covalent bonds and ionic-covalent bonds with SiO, silica or sand, as a fundamental building block. Ceramics are as soft as clay and as hard as stone and concrete. Usually, they are crystalline in form. Most glasses contain a metal oxide fused with silica. At high temperatures used to prepare glass, the material is a viscous liquid. Glass forms into an amorphous structure when it is cooled. Windowpanes and eyeglasses are important examples. Fibers of glass are also available. Diamond and carbon in its graphite form are considered to be ceramics. 
Engineering ceramics are known for their stiffness, high temperature, and stability under compression and electrical stress. Alumina, silica carbide, and tungsten carbide are made from a fine powder of their constituents in a process of sintering with a binder. Hot pressing provides higher density material. Chemical vapor deposition can place a film of a ceramic on another material. Cermets are ceramic particles containing some metals. The wear resistance of tools is derived from cemented carbides with the metal phase of cobalt and nickel typically added to modify properties.
Another application of material science in industry is the making of composite materials. Composite materials are structured materials composed of two or more macroscopic phases. Applications range from structural elements such as steel-reinforced concrete, to the thermally insulative tiles which play a key and integral role in National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Space Shuttle thermal protection system which is used to protect the surface of the shuttle from the heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. One example is Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC), The light gray material which withstands re-entry temperatures up to 1510 °C (2750 °F) and protects the Space Shuttle's wing leading edges and nose cap. RCC is a laminated composite material made from graphite rayon cloth and impregnated with a phenolic resin. After curing at high temperature in an autoclave, the laminate is pyrolized to convert the resin to carbon, impregnated with furfural alcohol in a vacuum chamber, and cured/pyrolized to convert the furfural alcohol to carbon. In order to provide oxidation resistance for reuse capability, the outer layers of the RCC are converted to silicon carbide.
Other examples can be seen in the "plastic" casings of television sets, cell-phones and similar objects. These plastic casings are usually a composite material. It is a thermoplastic matrix such as acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) in which calcium carbonate chalk, talc, glass fibers or carbon fibers have been added for added strength, bulk, or electro-static dispersion. These additions may be referred to as reinforcing fibers, or dispersants, depending on their purpose.
A new magnetic material has been discovered. It could transform computer hard drives and energy storage devices. 
A highly sensitive metal bilayer needs only a small shift in temperature to dramatically alter its magnetism. This is a very useful property in electronic engineering. "No other material known to man can do this. It's a huge effect. And we can engineer it", said Ivan Schuller, of the University of California, San Diego.
The material combines thin layers of nickel and vanadium oxide. This is a structure which is surprisingly responsive to heat. "We can control the magnetism in just a narrow range of temperature without applying a magnetic field. And in principle we could also control it with voltage or current", said Prof Schuller.
Materials science encompasses various classes of materials, each of which may constitute a separate field. Materials are sometimes classified by the type of bonding present between the atoms:

Catwalk

A catwalk is a raised walkway. The term is most often used for fashion shows, where models walk along showing off the clothes. A catwalk on a ship is a passageway above decks. A similar term is runway, but that need not be off the ground.

The movie followed models Christy Turlington, Naomi Campbell, Yasmin Le Bon, Kate Moss, and Carla Bruni as they jetted around London, Milan, Paris, and New York during Spring Fashion Week, including behind-the-scenes footage. The movie was shot in black and white and colour, and featured many top designers at work, like a young John Galliano, Justin Thomas, Karl Lagerfeld, and Gianni Versace four years before his death.

<doc id="306744" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=306744" title="Thames Barrier">
Thames Barrier

The Thames Barrier is the world's second-largest movable flood barrier, after the Oosterscheldekering in the Netherlands. It is downstream of central London. Its purpose is to prevent London from being flooded by exceptionally high tides and storm surges moving up from the North Sea. It is raised (closed) only during high tide; at ebb tide it is lowered to release the water which backs up behind it.
The barrier's northern bank is in the London Borough of Newham and its southern bank is in the London Borough of Greenwich. The report of Hermann Bondi into the North Sea flood of 1953 affecting parts of the Thames Estuary and parts of London was instrumental in the building of the barrier.
London is vulnerable to flooding. A storm surge generated by low pressure in the Atlantic Ocean sometimes tracks eastwards past the north of Scotland and may then be driven into the shallow waters of the North Sea. The surge tide is funnelled down the North Sea which narrows towards the English Channel and the Thames Estuary. If the storm surge coincides with a spring tide, dangerously high water levels can occur in the Thames Estuary. This situation combined with downstream flows in the Thames tells engineers when to operate the barriers.
The threat has increased over time due to the slow but continuous rise in high water level over the centuries (20 cm (8 inches) / 100 years) and the slow "tilting" of Britain (up in the north and west, and down in the south and east) caused by post-glacial rebound.
Fourteen people died in the 1928 Thames flood, and after 307 people died in the UK in the North Sea Flood of 1953 the issue gained new prominence.
Early proposals for a flood control system were stymied by the need for a large opening in the barrier to allow for vessels from London Docks to pass through. When containerization replaced older forms of shipping and a new port was opened at Tilbury, a smaller barrier became feasible with each of the four main navigation spans being the same width as the opening of Tower Bridge.
A Thames Barrier flood defence closure is triggered when high tides are forecast in the North Sea "and" river flows are high at the tidal limit at Teddington weir. If water levels might exceed in central London, that is the trigger.
Closure begins about 9 hours before a dangerous high tide reaches the barrier. Messages give orders to stop river traffic, close subsidiary gates and alert other river users. As well as the Thames Barrier, the smaller gates along the Thames Tideway must be closed. Once river navigation has been stopped and all gates closed, then the Thames Barrier itself can be closed. The smaller gates are closed first, then the main navigable spans in succession. The gates remain closed until the tide downstream of the barrier falls to the same level as the water level upstream.
After heavy rain west of London, floodwater flows down the Thames upstream (before London). Because the river is tidal from Teddington weir all the way through London, "this is only a problem at high tide", which prevents the floodwater from escaping out to sea. From Teddington the river is opening out into its estuary, and at low tide it can take much greater flow rates the further one goes downstream. 
When the river is in flood upstream, if the gates are closed shortly after low tide, a huge empty volume holds behind the barrier which can act as a reservoir to hold the floodwater coming over Teddington weir. Most river floods will not fill this volume in the few high tide hours when the barrier needs to be closed. If the barrier was not there, the high tide would fill up this volume instead, and the floodwater could then spill over the river banks in London. About a third of the closures up to 2009 were to prevent flooding caused by heavy rain to the west of London.
In the 1980s there were four closures, 35 closures in the 1990s, and 75 closures in the first decade of this century. The rate of closures is above that predicted, and is increasing rapidly.
An incident that was potentially catastrophic for London occurred on 27 October 1997. The dredger, MV "Sand Kite", sailing in thick fog, collided with one of the Thames Barrier's piers. As the ship started to sink she dumped her 3,300 tonne load of aggregate, finally sinking by the bow on top of one of the barrier's gates where she lay for several days. Initially the gate could not be closed as it was covered in a thick layer of gravel. A longer term problem was the premature loss of paint on the flat side of the gate caused by abrasion. One estimate of the cost of flooding damage, had it occurred, was around £13 billion. The vessel was refloated in mid-November 1997.
The barrier was closed twice on 9 November 2007 after a storm surge in the North Sea which was compared to the one in 1953. The main danger of flooding from the surge was on the coast above the Thames Barrier, where evacuations took place, but the winds abated a little and, at the Thames Barrier, the 9 November 2007 storm surge did not completely coincide with high tide.
The barrier was originally designed to protect London against a big flood level. The defence level included long-term changes in sea and land levels as understood at that time (~1970). Despite global warming, and a higher predicted rate of sea level rise, recent analysis suggested the barrier could last until around 2060–2070.
Released in 2005, a study by four respected academics contained a proposal to replace the Thames Barrier with a more ambitious 16 km (10 mi) long barrier across the Thames Estuary from Sheerness in Kent to Southend in Essex.

Environmental chemistry

Environmental chemistry is the scientific study of the chemical and biochemical phenomena that occur in natural places. Environmental chemistry can be defined as the study of the sources, reactions, transport, effects, and fates of chemical species in the air, soil, and water environments; and the effect of human activity on these. Environmental chemistry is an interdisciplinary science that includes atmospheric, aquatic and soil chemistry, as well as uses analytical chemistry. It is related to environmental and other areas of science. It is different from green chemistry, which tries to reduce potential pollution at its source.
Environmental chemistry starts by understanding how the uncontaminated environment works. It identifies the chemicals that are present naturally. It studies the concentration and effects of those chemicals. Then, it accurately study the effects humans have on the environment through the release of chemicals.
Environmental chemists draw on a range of concepts from chemistry and various environmental sciences to assist in their study of what is happening to a chemical in the environment. Important general concepts from chemistry include understanding chemical reactions and equations, solutions, units, sampling, and analytical techniques. Chemists study compounds with biological activity such as pheromones.
A contaminant is a substance present in nature at a level higher than typical levels or that would not otherwise be there. This may be due to human activity. The term contaminant is often used interchangeably with "pollutant", which is a substance that hurts the surrounding environment. While a contaminant is sometimes defined as a substance present in the environment as a result of human activity, but without harmful effects, it is sometimes the case that toxic or harmful effects from contamination only become apparent at a later date.
The "medium" (for example, soil) or organism (for example, fish) affected by the pollutant or contaminant is called a "receptor". A "sink" is a chemical medium or species that retains and interacts with the pollutant.
Chemical measures of water quality include dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total dissolved solids (TDS), pH, nutrients nitrates and phosphorus), heavy metals (including copper, zinc, cadmium, lead and mercury), and pesticides.
Environmental chemistry is used by the Environment Agency (in England and Wales), the Environmental Protection Agency (in the United States) the Association of Public Analysts, and other environmental agencies and research bodies around the world to detect and identify the nature and source of pollutants. These can include:
Quantitative chemical analysis is a key part of environmental chemistry, since it provides the data that frame most environmental studies.
Common analytical techniques used for quantitative determinations in environmental chemistry include classical wet chemistry, such as gravimetric, titrimetric and electrochemical methods. More sophisticated approaches are used in the determination of trace metals and organic compounds. Metals are commonly measured by atomic spectroscopy and mass spectrometry: Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission (ICP-AES) or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometric (ICP-MS) techniques. Organic compounds are commonly measured also using mass spectrometric methods, such as gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Non-MS methods using GCs and LCs having universal or specific detectors are still staples in the arsenal of available analytical tools.
Other parameters often measured in environmental chemistry are radiochemicals. These are pollutants which emit radioactive materials, such as alpha and beta particles, posing danger to human health and the environment. Particle counters and Scintillation counters are most commonly used for these measurements. Bioassays and immunoassays are utilized for toxicity evaluations of chemical effects on various organisms.
Peer-reviewed test methods have been published by government agencies

Joseph-Louis Lagrange

Joseph-Louis Lagrange (born Giuseppe Lodovico [Luigi] Lagrangia, Turin, Piedmont, 25 January 1736 – Paris, 10 April 1813) was a mathematician and astronomer. According to one authority, he was "the greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century".
He lived part of his life in Prussia and part in France. He made significant contributions to mathematical analysis, from number theory, to classical and celestial mechanics. 
On the recommendation of Euler and d'Alembert, in 1766 Lagrange succeeded Euler as the director of mathematics at the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. He stayed there for over twenty years, producing a large body of work and winning several prizes of the French Academy of Sciences. 
Lagrange's treatise on analytical mechanics, first published in 1788, was the best treatment of classical mechanics since Newton, and helped the development of mathematical physics in the nineteenth century.
Lagrange's parents were Italian, although he also had French ancestors on his father's side. In 1787, at age 51, he moved from Berlin to France and became a member of the French Academy, and he remained in France until the end of his life. Therefore, Lagrange is alternatively considered a French and an Italian scientist. 
Lagrange survived the French Revolution and became the first professor of analysis at the École Polytechnique upon its opening in 1794. Napoleon appointed Lagrange to the Legion of Honour and made him a Count of the Empire in 1808. Lagrange is buried in the Panthéon and his name appears as one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

Homeless World Cup

The Homeless World Cup is an football competition for homeless people all over the world. Starting in 2003 in Graz, Austria, the competition brings together homeless people with the aim to end homelessness.
Anyone can play, male or female, as long as they are at least 16 years old. They must also have been homeless at some point after the previous year's World Cup, work as a street newspaper seller to earn money or be asylum seekers.
A team of 4 players play, with 3 outfield players and 1 goalkeeper. 4 substitution players are allowed. 
A team gets 3 points for a win. If a match ends in a draw, it is decided by penalty shootout and the winning team gets three points and the losing team gets one point. Games are 14 minutes long, in two seven-minute halves. The field is 22m (long) x 16m (wide).
Since 2003 the competition has taken place in:
Mexico are the current champions of both the female and male tournaments after beating the Chilean women's team and the Ukrainian men's team in the 2015 finals in Amsterdam.
The 2006 Homeless World Cup was the filmed as part of a documentary called "Kicking It". directed by Susan Koch and Jeff Werner focusing on the experiences of seven homeless people at the Homeless World Cup football (soccer) game. Residents of Afghanistan; Kenya; Dublin, Ireland; Charlotte, North Carolina; Madrid, Spain and St. Petersburg in Russia were in the documentary which was narrated by actor Colin Farrell. The movie was released in January, 2008 at the Sundance Film Festival and is being distributed by Liberation Entertainment, Netflix and ESPN.

Amu Darya

The Amu Darya (, "Āmūdaryā"; , "Jihôn" or "Jayhoun"; , "Gozan" ), also called Oxus and Amu River, is a major river in Central Asia. It is formed by the junction of the Vakhsh and Panj. In ancient times, the river was regarded as the boundary between Iran and Tūrān.
In antiquity, the river was known as "Vaksu" to Indo-Aryans.
In ancient Afghanistan, the river was also called "Gozan", descriptions of which can be found in the book "The Kingdom of Afghanistan: a historical sketch By George Passman Tate".
In classical antiquity, the river was known as the "Ōxus" in Latin and Ὦξος "Oxos" in Greek. 
The name "Amu" is said to have come from the medieval city of "Āmul", (later, Chahar Joy/Charjunow, and now known as "Türkmenabat"), in modern Turkmenistan. "Darya" is the Persian word for "river".
Amu Darya is a river almost in reverse. It gets its water from a powerful glacier fed stream high in the Pamir Knot at the eastern end of Afghanistan's "Wakhan Corridor", and does not end at the sea but spreads out into the sands of Turkmenistan's" Kyzyl Kum" desert instead of the inland Aral Sea as it did in former times.
In the traditions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (ahadith), the river is called by the name Jayhan (Arabic form of its ancient name Gozan).
Historians tell us that one of the most ancient names for the Oxus or Amu in ancient Afghanistan was Gozan. A name used by Greek, Mongol, Chinese, Persian, Jewish and Afghan historians. However, this name is no longer used.
The river's total length is and its drainage basin totals in area. The river is navigable for over . All of the water comes from the high mountains in the south where annual precipitation can be over . Even before large-scale irrigation began, high summer evaporation meant that not all of this discharge reached the Aral Sea - though there is some evidence the large Pamir glaciers provided enough melt water for the Aral to overflow during the 13th and 14th centuries A.D.
Historical records state that in different periods, the river flowed into the Aral Sea (from the south), the Caspian Sea (from the east) or both, similar to the "Syr Darya" (Jaxartes, in Ancient Greek).
About of land is drained by the Amu Darya into the Aral Sea endorheic basin. This includes most of Tajikistan, the southwest corner of Kyrgyzstan, the northeast corner of Afghanistan, a long narrow portion of western Turkmenistan and about half of Uzbekistan. About 61% of the drainage lies within Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, while 39% is in Afghanistan.
Of the area drained by the Amu Darya, only about actively contribute water to the river.
This is because many of the river's major tributaries (especially the "Zeravshan River") have been diverted, and much of the river's drainage is dominated by outlying desert and steppe. 
The abundant water flowing in the Amu Darya almost entirely comes from glaciers in the Pamir Mountains and "Tian Shan",
which, standing above the surrounding arid plain, collect atmospheric moisture which otherwise would probably have escaped somewhere else. Without its mountain water sources, the Amu Darya would not contain any water because it rarely rains in the lowlands that characterize most of the river. Throughout most of the steppe, the annual rainfall is about .
The Amu Darya was called the "Oxus" by the ancient Greeks. In ancient times, the river was regarded as the boundary between Irān and Tūrān. The river's drainage lies in the area between the former empires of Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great, although they occurred at much different times. One southern route of the Silk Road ran along part of the Amu Darya northwestward from Termez before going westwards to the Caspian Sea.
It is believed that the Amu Darya's course across the Kara-Kum Desert has gone through several major shifts in the past few thousand years. Much of the time, the most recent period being in the 13th century to the late 16th century, the Amu Darya emptied into both the Aral and the Caspian Seas. Sometimes, the flow through the two branches was more or less equal, but often, most of the Amu Darya's flow split to the west and flowed into the Caspian. 
People began to settle along the lower Amu Darya and the Uzboy in the 5th century A.D., establishing a thriving chain of agricultural lands, towns, and cities. 
The first British explorer who reached the region was a naval officer called John Wood. He was sent on an expedition to find the source of the river in 1839. He found modern day Lake Zorkul, called it Lake Victoria and proclaimed he had found the source. Then, the French explorer and geographer Thibaut Viné collected a lot of informations about this area during five expeditions between 1856 and 1862.
The Soviet Union became the ruling power in the 20th century. The Soviet Union fell in the 1990s and Central Asia split up into the many smaller countries that lie within or partially within the Amu Darya basin. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya were first used by the Soviets to irrigate extensive cotton fields in the Central Asian plain. Before this time, water from the rivers was already being used for agriculture, but not on this massive scale. The Qaraqum Canal, Karshi Canal, and Bukhara Canal were among the larger of the irrigation diversions built. The Main Turkmen Canal was a proposed project that would have diverted water along the dry Uzboy River bed into central Turkmenistan, but was never built.
The Oxus river, and Arnold's poem, provide a literary background for the 1930s children's book The Far-Distant Oxus.

Founding Fathers of the United States

The Founding Fathers refers to certain men who lived during the American Revolutionary War era. These men signed the Declaration of Independence, helped write the Constitution of the United States, or helped win the American Revolutionary War. Many of these men were members of the Continental Congress at some point. The term was first applied to these people in 1916.
There were many people who were Founding Fathers. Some scholars like to limit them to a small number, such as seven: George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison.
Most of the Founding Fathers were large landowners or rich merchants. The majority owned slaves. After the Constitution, many of the Founding Fathers became leaders in the federal government.

It is both 1) a method for learning key facts about molecular orbitals as well as 2) the name of a particular set of computer programs. CNDO is based on quantum chemistry. It is one of the first semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods. It uses two approximations:
CNDO builds a mathematical model of a molecule. CNDO starts with the position of the positively charged nuclei of the atoms and the negatively charged electron clouds surrounding them. Quantum chemistry tells the model the probability distribution of electron locations based on atomic orbitals. From this information, CNDO computes data about the resulting molecular orbitals.
CNDO/2 is the main version of CNDO. John Pople and coworkers first wrote CNDO/2.

Selena (movie)

Selena is a biographical drama movie. It was released on March 21, 1997, by Warner Bros. Gregory Nava was the director and the screenwriter. The movie is about the singer Selena. She was murdered at age 23 by her friend, an ex-employee of her clothing stores. The movie also describes how Selena started in the music business and her family's problems. Jennifer Lopez starred as Selena, and many music critics believe this movie made Lopez famous. "Selena" was produced by Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. (Selena's father), Moctesuma Esparza and Robert Katz. 
Lopez was given $1 million for her role as Selena, making her the highest-paid Hispanic woman ever, at the time. The contained two unreleased songs, two tribute songs and two melodies. It reached number seven on the US "Billboard" 200 chart. It was certified platinum for shipments of one million copies in the United States.bagamash
Nava had a budget of $20 million to make this movie. They filmed the movie in Corpus Christi, San Antonio and Houston, Texas. Over 35,000 fans participated in the Houston Astrodome scene. The movie made $15,599,598 on its first week, the number one movie for that week. In total, it made $35,281,794 in 101 days. "Selena" had mostly good reviews from critics, though many thought the movie did not tell the true story of Selena. The movie won several ALMA Awards and Imagen Foundation Awards. It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, MTV Movie Awards and a Young Artist Award.
The movie starts with Selena (Jennifer Lopez) getting ready for her Houston Astrodome concert on February 26, 1995. After her performance, the movie goes back in time to 1961. Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. (Edward James Olmos) and his band Los Dinos are at band practice. After band practice, they went to see a promoter in the other side of town. Los Dinos are then discriminated for being Americans of Mexican heritage. Los Dinos then performed at a Spanish nightclub, and are booed off stage by Mexicans for not knowing any Mexican music. The movie goes forward in time to 1981. Abraham had quit his dreams of becoming a music star and began helping his family. After work, Abraham sat down on his chair and began playing the guitar. His youngest child, Selena (Rebecca Lee Meza) was playing a football game in the backyard. She noticed her father and was curious to know what he was doing. She started to sing in front of Abraham. Abraham was surprised, he started a family band, and named it Selena y Los Dinos. He puts A.B. Quintanilla III (Rafael Tamayo) on base and Suzette Quintanilla (Victoria Elena Flores) on drums. Selena became the singer of the group. 
The movie is now set in 1989, where Selena is performing at a Houston, Texas festival as an adult. In the next scene, Selena began talking to her cousin (Seidy Lopez) about her dreams of becoming a fashion designer. Suzette (Jackie Guerra) ran upstairs and told them that a rock guitarist is in their kitchen. The three of them began spying to see what's going on. Chris Perez (Jon Seda) began to audition as the band's new guitarist in front of Abraham. Abraham tells A.B. (Jacob Vargas) that he does not like Chris. This is because he is a rocker. However, A.B. tries to tell Abraham that Chris will change his style and look. The next day, Selena asks Chris to eat with her at a pizzeria. In the next scene, Selena's song "Como La Flor" reached number one on "Billboard" which made the group come together and celebrate. Selena is asked to perform in Mexico where 50,000 fans are waiting on her to sing. Selena came out to perform "La Carcacha". However, the crowd became very excited and started pushing people inside of the stage. Selena is later asked by her father to calm down the crowd. She performed a slower version of "Como La Flor" and calmed everyone down. After her performance, she and Chris walked on a pier. Selena told him that she was scared for the first time, while Chris tells Selena that he loves her.
While on the bus, Abraham found out that Chris liked Selena. Abraham tells Chris and Selena that their relationship is over. He then fires Chris and orders him to leave. Selena tried to run after him, however, her father told her that if she did that he will disband the group. After this, Selena and Chris began to meet secretly and they eloped. Selena went to her father's house the next day. Abraham began crying and told Selena that he was sorry. He then accepted Chris into the family. In the next scene, Selena won a Grammy Award and opened her clothing stores. She hired Yolanda Saldivar (Lupe Ontiveros) as the manager. Yolanda began to steal money from these places. After this, Selena started recording songs for her crossover album. Abraham later finds out that Yolanda was stealing money, and holds a meeting to hear Yolanda's side. Yolanda tells Abraham that if given time, she will prove her innocence. Later that night, Selena performed "Si Una Vez" at the Houston Astrodome on February 26, 1995. After that night, Selena asked her mother to scratch her head and that she and Chris are thinking of starting a family. Selena then dreams of the crossover tour and sings "Dreaming of You". After Selena sings the opening of the song, a rose is thrown at her. Selena is seen being rushed to the hospital. Reporters tells everyone that Selena was shot by Saldívar during an argument over the missing financial records. In the next scene, a doctor walks towards Selena's parents. He tells them that Selena has died. "Dreaming of You" is played again, while her fans are seen holding pictures of her during a candlelight vigil. The movie ends with a picture of Selena waving goodbye reading "April 16, 1971 – March 31, 1995".
This is a list of the actors and their roles in "Selena":
Selena's family wanted to make a movie about Selena's life. They searched Hollywood, California for movie producers. Abraham then contacted Moctesuma Esparza and Robert Katz. They chose Gregory Nava as the movie director. Abraham told Esparza and Katz that he did not like Nava because of his "ego". The two producers told Abraham that everyone in Hollywood had an "ego problem". They also told him that Nava was the right guy.
Nava spent one month with the Quintanilla family. He wrote down everything that the family said about Selena. By the fifth week, Nava had written the movie and showed Abraham the draft. Abraham was not happy — he did not want Selena's fans to think that eloping was a right thing to do. He also did not like the conflict between his character and Chris Perez. Nava responded that the information was "life events". He also said that even though he may seem like a "bad guy" in the movie, his actions after the marriage would make people see him differently. Abraham agreed and allowed the two stories in the movie. Salma Hayek was originally asked to play the role of Selena in the movie, but she turned it down. She felt that it was "too early" to base a movie on Selena and that it would be too emotional since Selena's death was still being covered on television. 
Filming took place in Corpus Christi, San Antonio and Houston, Texas from May to October 1996. Nava posted fliers in Texas asking Selena fans to attend the Houston Astrodome scene. News of this event spread throughout the United States and Mexico. Over 35,000 people attended, some coming from as far as Japan and South America. It took over 3 hours to put makeup on everyone who attended. Producing the Astrodome scene cost about $2 million. The budget of the movie was $20 million.
The movie's trailer was released worldwide in December 1996. Nava spent $1 million on promotions for "Selena".
The soundtrack of the movie was released on March 11, 1997 by EMI Latin. The soundtrack included two songs that Selena did not release when she was alive: "Is It the Beat?" and "Where Did the Feeling Go?". It included two medleys — "Disco Medley" and the "Cumbia Medley". They are live versions Selena sang during her Houston Astrodome concert. Two tribute songs were also in the album. "Viviras Selena" includes Tejano singers and the Barrio Boyzz. "One More Time", which was composed by Olmos is performed by Lil'Ray. The "Oldies Medley" was performed by the Vidal Brothers. The soundtrack reached at number seven on the US "Billboard" 200 chart and number 36 on Canada's "RPM". It was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies in the United States. The album was produced by Selena's brother, Quintanilla III.
Chuck Eddy of "Entertainment Weekly" gave the soundtrack an "A" rating and stated that the soundtrack had everything a "right posthumous" album should have. Eddy also stated that listening to the album reveals why Selena's death impacted many Americans. Enrique Lopetegui of the "Los Angeles Times" wrote that "One More Time" was a "corny but effective" tribute to Selena. Lopetegui commented that "Viviras Selena" was the "weakest track" of the album and that "Is It the Beat?" was one of the "best songs" of "Selena". He believed that "Where Did the Feeling Go?" was one of the "strongest". Lopetegui also stated that "Where Did the Feeling Go?" was similar to "Vision of Love" which was recorded by Mariah Carey. Lopetegui compared "Is It the Beat?" to the song "I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)" by Whitney Houston, which had similar beats and sounds. A "Miami Herald" writer believed the soundtrack was "uneven" and stated that Selena's unreleased recordings "outshines" the rest of the songs on the album. A score was released in the summer of 1997 and had music by Dave Grusin.
Before the movie was released, Selena fans were not happy that a Puerto Rican would play the part of a Mexican American singer. Many fans changed their views on Lopez after the Houston Astrodome scene was done filming. The movie opened in 1,850 theaters worldwide. "Selena" was released on March 21, 1997, and grossed $11,615,722, making it the second-highest debut for that week. It grossed $15,599,598 during its first week and became the number-one movie for that week. The next week, the movie grossed $24,285,142. In total, "Selena" grossed $35,281,794. It became the first and only movie directed by Nava to reach the 30 millionth mark. "Selena" was in theaters for 101 days, and Lopez's portrayal of Selena became the "breakthrough role" (becoming very important) for her career. She became very popular after the movie was released. "Selena" was released on VHS and DVD in fall 1997. On September 18, 2007, Warner Bros. released a 10th anniversary of the movie. It featured unreleased "behind the scenes" and extras.
The movie had mostly positive feedback from critics. Enrique Fernandez of the "Sun Sentinel" wrote that Nava did a great job in "catching the audience" with "Selena". Fernandez also stated that Lopez had a "terrific characterization" of Selena. Steve Persall of the "St. Petersburg Times" believed that Nava did not do a good job in retelling Selena's murder. Persall believed Nava was under pressure by Selena's family and fans to tell a more "fairy tale" movie then a "real life event". Daisann McLane of "Sun Sentinel" agreed that the movie was more of a "fairy tale" and that "the movie is the family's version of the story". McLane believed that "Selena" "lie[d]" about Selena's "real life". Stuart Elliott of "Austin American-Statesmen" wrote that "Selena" became a "breakthrough success" in Selena's career. Elliott believed that Nava had "perfect[ed]" every scene and that female Hispanics in America can relate to the conflicts and the climax of the story.

Grignard reaction

The Grignard reaction (pronounced ) is an organometallic chemical reaction in which alkyl- or aryl-magnesium halides (Grignard reagents) attack electrophilic carbon atoms that are present within polar bonds (for example, in a carbonyl group as in the example shown below). Grignard reagents act as nucleophiles. The Grignard reaction produces a carbon–carbon bond. It alters hybridization about the reaction center. The Grignard reaction is an important tool in the formation of carbon–carbon bonds. It also can form carbon–phosphorus, carbon–tin, carbon–silicon, carbon–boron and other carbon–heteroatom bonds.
It is a nucleophilic organometallic addition reaction. The high pK value of the alkyl component (pK = ~45) makes the reaction irreversible. Grignard reactions are not ionic. The Grignard reagent exists as an organometallic cluster (in ether).
The disadvantage of Grignard reagents is that they readily react with protic solvents (such as water), or with functional groups with acidic protons, such as alcohols and amines. Atmospheric humidity can alter the yield of making a Grignard reagent from magnesium turnings and an alkyl halide. One of many methods used to exclude water from the reaction atmosphere is to flame-dry the reaction vessel to evaporate all moisture, which is then sealed to prevent moisture from returning. Chemists then use ultrasound to activate the surface of the magnesium so that it consumes any water present. This can allow Grignard reagents to form with less sensitivity to water being present.
Another disadvantage of Grignard reagents is that they do not readily form carbon–carbon bonds by reacting with alkyl halides by an S2 mechanism.
François Auguste Victor Grignard discovered Grignard reactions and reagents. They are named after this French chemist (University of Nancy, France) who was awarded the 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work.
The addition of the Grignard reagent to a carbonyl typically proceeds through a six-membered ring transition state.
However, with steric hindered Grignard reagents, the reaction may proceed by single-electron transfer.
Grignard reactions will not work if water is present; water causes the reagent to rapidly decompose. So, most Grignard reactions occur in solvents such as anhydrous diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran (THF), because the oxygen in these solvents stabilizes the magnesium reagent. The reagent may also react with oxygen present in the atmosphere. This will insert an oxygen atom between the carbon base and the magnesium halide group. Usually, this side-reaction may be limited by the volatile solvent vapors displacing air above the reaction mixture. However, chemists may perform the reactions in nitrogen or argon atmospheres. In small scale reactions, the solvent vapors do not have enough space to protect the magnesium from oxygen.
Grignard reagents are formed by the action of an alkyl or aryl halide on magnesium metal. The reaction is conducted by adding the organic halide to a suspension of magnesium in an ether, which provides ligands required to stabilize the organomagnesium compound. Typical solvents are diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. Oxygen and protic solvents such as water or alcohols are not compatible with Grignard reagents. The reaction proceeds through single electron transfer.
Grignard reactions often start slowly. First, there is an induction period during which reactive magnesium becomes exposed to the organic reagents. After this induction period, the reactions can be highly exothermic. Alkyl and aryl bromides and iodides are common substrates. Chlorides are also used, but fluorides are generally unreactive, except with specially activated magnesium, such as Rieke magnesium.
Many Grignard reagents, such as methylmagnesium chloride, phenylmagnesium bromide, and allylmagnesium bromide are available commercially in tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether solutions.
Using the Schlenk equilibrium, Grignard reagents form varying amounts of diorganomagnesium compounds (R = organic group, X = halide):
Many methods have been developed to initiate Grignard reactions that are slow to start. These methods weaken the layer of MgO that covers the magnesium. They expose the magnesium to the organic halide to start the reaction that makes the Grignard reagent.
Mechanical methods include crushing of the Mg pieces "in situ", rapid stirring, or using ultrasound (sonication) of the suspension. Iodine, methyl iodide, and 1,2-dibromoethane are commonly employed activating agents. Chemists use 1,2-dibromoethane because its action can be monitored by the observation of bubbles of ethylene. Also, the side-products are innocuous:
The amount of Mg consumed by these activating agents is usually insignificant.
The addition of a small amount of mercuric chloride will amalgamate the surface of the metal, allowing it to react.
Grignard reagents are produced in industry for use in place, or for sale. As with at bench-scale, the main problem is that of initiation. A portion of a previous batch of Grignard reagent is often used as the initiator. Grignard reactions are exothermic; this exothermicity must be considered when a reaction is scaled-up from laboratory to production plant.
Grignard reagents will react with a variety of carbonyl derivatives.
The most common application is for alkylation of aldehydes and ketones, as in this example:
Note that the acetal function (a masked carbonyl) does not react.
Such reactions usually involve a water-based (aqueous) acidic workup, though this is rarely shown in reaction schemes. In cases where the Grignard reagent is adding to a prochiral aldehyde or ketone, the Felkin-Anh model or Cram's Rule can usually predict which stereoisomer will form.
In addition, Grignard reagents will react with electrophiles.
Another example is making salicylaldehyde (not shown above). First, bromoethane reacts with Mg in ether. Second, phenol in THF converts the phenol into Ar-OMgBr. Third, benzene is added in the presence of paraformaldehyde powder and triethylamine. Fourth, the mixture is distilled to remove the solvents. Next, 10% HCl is added. Salicylaldehyde will be the major product as long as everything is very dry and under inert conditions. The reaction works also with iodoethane instead of bromoethane.
The Grignard reagent is very useful for forming carbon–heteroatom bonds.
A Grignard reagent can also be involved in coupling reactions. For example, nonylmagnesium bromide reacts with methyl "p"-chlorobenzoate to give "p"-nonylbenzoic acid, in the presence of Tris(acetylacetonato)iron(III), often symbolized as Fe(acac), after workup with NaOH to hydrolyze the ester, shown as follows. Without the Fe(acac), the Grignard reagent would attack the ester group over the aryl halide.
For the coupling of aryl halides with aryl Grignards, nickel chloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) is also a good catalyst. Additionally, an effective catalyst for the couplings of alkyl halides is dilithium tetrachlorocuprate (LiCuCl), prepared by mixing lithium chloride (LiCl) and copper(II) chloride (CuCl) in THF. The Kumada-Corriu coupling gives access to [substituted] styrenes.
The oxidation of a Grignard reagent with oxygen takes place through a radical intermediate to a magnesium hydroperoxide. Hydrolysis of this complex yields hydroperoxides and reduction with an additional equivalent of Grignard reagent gives an alcohol.
A reaction of Grignards with oxygen in presence of an alkene makes an ethylene extended alcohol. These are useful in synthesizing larger compounds. This modification requires aryl or vinyl Grignard reagents. Adding just the Grignard and the alkene does not result in a reaction, showing that the presence of oxygen is essential. The only drawback is the requirement of at least two equivalents of Grignard reagent in the reaction. This can addressed by using a dual Grignard system with a cheap reducing Grignard reagent such as n-butylmagnesium bromide.
Grignard reagents are nucleophiles in nucleophilic aliphatic substitutions for instance with alkyl halides in a key step in industrial Naproxen production:
In the Boord olefin synthesis, the addition of magnesium to certain β-haloethers results in an elimination reaction to the alkene. This reaction can limit the utility of Grignard reactions.
Grignard degradation at one time was a tool in structure identification (elucidation) in which a Grignard RMgBr formed from a heteroaryl bromide HetBr reacts with water to Het-H (bromine replaced by a hydrogen atom) and MgBrOH. This hydrolysis method allows the determination of the number of halogen atoms in an organic compound. In modern usage, Grignard degradation is used in the chemical analysis of certain triacylglycerols.
An example of the Grignard reaction is a key step in the industrial production of Tamoxifen. (Tamoxifen is currently used for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer in women.):

Giant Magellan Telescope

The Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) will be the world's largest telescope when it is completed in 2018. Instead of one large mirror, the GMT will have seven separate mirrors working together. This will mean its collecting area is bigger than the actual mirror surfaces. It will be made of seven diameter mirror parts. It will have a the resolving power of a mirror. Its collecting area will be the same as a mirror. The telescope will have over four times the ability to gather light than existing telescopes. It will produce images up to ten times clearer than the Hubble Space Telescope. It will cost $700 million.
The location of the telescope is the Las Campanas Observatory, which is also the site of the Magellan Telescopes, some northeast of La Serena, Chile. This area has clear weather for most of the year. The night sky in most of the surrounding Atacama Desert region is free from atmospheric pollution. With few cities nearby this is probably one of the places least affected by light pollution. All of this makes the area one of the best spots on Earth for long-term astronomical observation.
The telescope is unique because it will use seven mirror sections, each in diameter. These segments will then be arranged to form a single optical surface. This is difficult as the surface of the outer six mirror segments is not radially symmetrical (that is, they are off-axis). This requires a small change in the way mirrors are usually polished. All seven mirrors will be arranged so that the reflecting surface of each of them is on a common axis. One mirror will be in the center and the other six arranged symmetrically around the center. A focal plane will be on-axis with the entire assembly. The plan is to build seven identical off-axis mirrors. The spare mirror has been made to replace a mirror when it needs recoating, a 1–2 week (per segment) process required every 1–2 years.
The Steward Observatory, at the University of Arizona, is making the mirrors in a laboratory beneath the university's football stadium. It is using a rotating furnace to make the mirror. The casting of the first mirror was completed on November 3, 2005. But the time-consuming shaping and polishing will be completed in the autumn of 2011.
The telescope will make use of adaptive optics.
The following is a list of the group which is developing the telescope.
George P. Mitchell, founder of Mitchell Energy & Development Corp., and The Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation are giving $25 million to help pay for the telescope.

Mass spectrum

A mass spectrum is an intensity versus "m/z" (mass-to-charge ratio) plot that represents a chemical analysis. The mass spectrum of a sample is a pattern representing the distribution of ions by mass (more correctly: mass-to-charge ratio) in a sample. It is a histogram usually made using an instrument called a mass spectrometer. Not all mass spectra of a given substance are the same. It can depend on the operating conditions of the instrument. For example, some mass spectrometers break the analyte molecules into many pieces; others observe the intact molecular masses with little fragmentation. A mass spectrum can represent many different types of information based on the type of mass spectrometer and the specific experiment; however, all plots of intensity vs. mass-to-charge are called "mass spectra".
Common fragmentation processes for organic molecules are the McLafferty rearrangement and alpha cleavage.
In the past, chemists with PhD degrees were needed to interpret mass spectra. Today, computer programs read the data and identify the compounds in a sample.

<doc id="306927" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=306927" title="SN2 reaction">
SN2 reaction

The S2 reaction (also known as bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) is a substitution reaction in organic chemistry. It is a type of nucleophilic substitution, where a lone pair from a nucleophile attacks an electron deficient electrophilic center and bonds to it. This expels another group called a "leaving group". So, the incoming group replaces the leaving group in one step. Since two reacting species are involved in the slow, rate-determining step of the reaction, this leads to the name "bimolecular nucleophilic substitution", or "S2". Among inorganic chemists, the S2 reaction is often known as the "interchange mechanism".
The reaction most often occurs at an aliphatic sp carbon center with an electronegative, stable leaving group attached to it - 'X' - frequently a halide atom. The breaking of the C-X bond and the formation of the new C-Nu bond occur simultaneously to form a transition state in which the carbon under nucleophilic attack is pentacoordinate, and approximately sp hybridized. The nucleophile attacks the carbon at 180° to the leaving group, since this provides the best overlap between the nucleophile's lone pair and the C-X σ* antibonding orbital. The leaving group is then pushed off the opposite side and the product is formed.
If the substrate under nucleophilic attack is chiral, this can lead, although not necessarily, to an inversion of stereochemistry, called the Walden inversion.
In an example of the S2 reaction, the attack of OH (the nucleophile) on a bromoethane (the electrophile) results in ethanol, with bromide ejected as the leaving group:
A S2 reaction occurs if the backside route of attack is not blocked by other atoms in the molecule (sterically hindered by substituents on the substrate). So, this mechanism usually occurs at an unhindered primary carbon center. If there is steric crowding on the substrate near the leaving group, such as at a tertiary carbon center, the substitution will use an S1 rather than an S2 mechanism, (an S1 would also be more likely with blocked molecules because a sufficiently stable carbocation intermediary could be formed.)
In coordination chemistry, associative substitution proceeds by a similar mechanism as S2.
Four factors affect the rate of the reaction:
The rate of an S2 reaction is second order, as the rate-determining step depends on the nucleophile concentration, [Nu] as well as the concentration of substrate, [RX].
This is a key difference between the S1 and S2 mechanisms. In the S1 reaction, the nucleophile attacks after the rate-limiting step is over. But in a S2 reaction, the nucleophile forces off the leaving group in the limiting step. In other words, the rate of S1 reactions depend only on the concentration of the substrate while the S2 reaction rate depends on the concentration of both the substrate and nucleophile. In cases where both mechanisms are possible (for example at a secondary carbon center), the mechanism depends on solvent, temperature, concentration of the nucleophile or on the leaving group.
S2 reactions are generally favored in primary alkyl halides or secondary alkyl halides with an aprotic solvent. They occur at a negligible rate in tertiary alkyl halides due to steric hindrance.
S2 and S1 are two extremes of a sliding scale of reactions. It is possible to find many reactions which exhibit both S2 and S1 character in their mechanisms. For instance, it is possible to get a contact ion pairs formed from an alkyl halide in which the ions are not fully separated. When these undergo substitution the stereochemistry will be inverted (as in S2) for many of the reacting molecules but a few may show retention of configuration. S2 reactions are more common than S1 reactions.
A common side reaction taking place with S2 reactions is E2 elimination: the incoming anion can act as a base rather than as a nucleophile, removing a proton and leading to formation of the alkene. This effect can be demonstrated in the gas-phase reaction between a sulfonate and a simple alkyl bromide taking place inside a mass spectrometer:
With ethyl bromide, the reaction product is predominantly the substitution product. As steric hindrance around the electrophilic center increases, as with isobutyl bromide, substitution is disfavored and elimination is the predominant reaction. Other factors favoring elimination are the strength of the base. With the less basic benzoate substrate, isopropyl bromide reacts with 55% substitution. In general, gas phase reactions and solution phase reactions of this type follow the same trends, even though in the first, solvent effects are dropped.
A development attracting attention in 2008 concerns a S2 roundabout mechanism observed in a gas-phase reaction between chloride ions and methyl iodide with a special technique called "crossed molecular beam imaging". When the chloride ions have sufficient velocity, the energy of the resulting iodide ions after the collision is much lower than expected, and it is theorized that energy is lost as a result of a full roundabout of the methyl group around the iodine atom before the actual displacement takes place.

SN1 reaction

The S1 reaction is a substitution reaction in organic chemistry. "S" stands for nucleophilic substitution and the "1" represents the fact that the rate-determining step involves only one molecule (unimolecular). The reaction involves a carbocation intermediate. Some common S1 reactions are of secondary or tertiary alkyl halides under strongly basic conditions or, under strongly acidic conditions, with secondary or tertiary alcohols. With primary alkyl halides, the alternative S2 reaction occurs. Among inorganic chemists, the S1 reaction is often known as the "dissociative mechanism". Christopher Ingold et al. first proposed the reaction mechanism in 1940.
An example of a reaction taking place with an S1 reaction mechanism is the hydrolysis of tert-butyl bromide with water to form tert-butyl alcohol:
This S1 reaction takes place in three steps:
Because the first step is the bottleneck or "rate-determining step" chemists classify the entire reaction mechanism as S1. Only one molecule is needed for that step.
Sometimes a molecule can react using either an S1 or an S2 mechanism.
The S1 mechanism will win this competition when the central carbon atom is surrounded by bulky groups because such groups sterically hinder the S2 reaction. Additionally, bulky substituents on the central carbon increase the rate of carbocation formation because of the relief of steric strain that occurs. The resultant carbocation is also stabilized by both inductive stabilization and hyperconjugation from attached alkyl groups. The Hammond-Leffler postulate says that this too will increase the rate of carbocation formation. The S1 mechanism therefore dominates in reactions at tertiary alkyl centers and is further observed at secondary alkyl centers in the presence of weak nucleophiles.
An example of a reaction proceeding in a S1 way is the synthesis of "2,5-dichloro-2,5-dimethylhexane" from the corresponding diol with concentrated hydrochloric acid:
As the alpha and beta substitutions increase with respect to leaving groups, the reaction is diverted from S2 to S1.
The carbocation intermediate formed in the reaction's rate limiting step is an "sp" hybridized carbon with trigonal planar molecular geometry. This allows two different paths for the nucleophilic attack, one on either side of the planar molecule. If neither path is preferentially favored, these two paths will be used equally, yielding a racemic mix of enantiomers if the reaction takes place at a stereocenter. This is illustrated below in the S1 reaction of S-3-chloro-3-methylhexane with an iodide ion, which yields a racemic mixture of 3-iodo-3-methylhexane:
However, an excess of one stereoisomer can be observed, as the leaving group can remain close to the carbocation intermediate for a short time and block nucleophilic attack. This is very different than the S2 mechanism, which does not mix the stereochemistry of the product (a stereospecific mechanism). The S2 mechanism always inverts the molecule's stereochemistry.
Two common side reactions are elimination reactions and carbocation rearrangement. If the reaction is performed under warm or hot conditions (which favor an increase in entropy), E1 elimination is likely to predominate, leading to formation of an alkene. At lower temperatures, S1 and E1 reactions are competitive reactions. So, it becomes difficult to favor one over the other. Even if the reaction is performed cold, some alkene may be formed. If an attempt is made to perform an S1 reaction using a strongly basic nucleophile such as hydroxide or methoxide ion, the alkene will again be formed, this time via an E2 elimination. This will be especially true if the reaction is heated. Finally, if the carbocation intermediate can rearrange to a more stable carbocation, it will give a product derived from the more stable carbocation rather than the simple substitution product.
Solvents will change the reaction rate. Since the S1 reaction involves formation of an unstable carbocation intermediate in the rate-determining step, anything that can help this will speed up the reaction. The normal solvents of choice are both "polar" (to stabilize ionic intermediates in general) and "protic" (to solvate the leaving group in particular). Typical polar protic solvents include water and alcohols, which will also act as nucleophiles.
The Y scale correlates solvolysis reaction rates of any solvent (k) with that of a standard solvent (80% v/v ethanol/water) (k) through
formula_1
with "m" a reactant constant ("m" = 1 for tert-butyl chloride),
For example 100% ethanol gives Y = −2.3, 50% ethanol in water Y = +1.65 and 15% concentration Y = +3.2.

SC Austria Lustenau

SC Austria Lustenau is a football club from Lustenau, Vorarlberg. The club is playing in the Erste Liga, the second division in Austria.
The club was founded in June 1914 as football department of Turnerbund Lustenau and was named FA Turnerbund Lustenau. This name had the club till 1936. For not having a football assosiation in Vorarlberg the club only played friendly matches. During the time of First World War there were no matches. In 1920 the club started in a regular championship. The first success was the Vorarlberg championship in the 1929/30 season. They were qualified for the Austrian Amateur Championship and reached the final versus Kremser SC. 
In 1936 the club left the Turnerbund Lustenau and became a club of its own. The were renamed to SC Austria Lustenau. In the following years they reached several titels. In 1994 they won the Regionalliga West and were promoted to the First League, the second division in Austrian football. From 1997 to 2000 they played in the Bundesliga, the top division of Austrias football.
The biggest success so far was the Cup final in 2010/11. Austria Lustenau was the first club from Vorarlberg which ever reached a Cup final. The match was lost against SV Ried.
"As of 12 August 2011."

Cradle of Humankind

The Cradle of Humankind is a World Heritage Site. It was first named by UNESCO in 1999. The site is about 50 kilometres northwest of Johannesburg, South Africa in the Gauteng province, and occupies . 
The site's limestone caves, including the Sterkfontein Caves, were where fossils were found. A 2.3-million year-old fossil "Australopithecus africanus" (nicknamed 'Mrs. Ples') was found in 1947 by Robert Broom and John T. Robinson. The find followed the 1924 discovery of the juvenile "Australopithecus africanus" skull, 'Taung Child', by Raymond Dart, at Taung in the North West Province of South Africa, where excavations still continue.
The name "Cradle of Humankind" reflects the fact that the site has produced a large number, as well as some of the oldest, hominid fossils ever found, some dating back as far as 3.5 million years ago. Sterkfontein alone has produced more than a third of early hominid fossils ever found.
The remains of several partial skeletons of a previously unknown Australopithecan species were found in 2008 near Johannesburg. They have been dated to about two million year ago (mya). A recent re-examination of two partial skeletons of "Australopithecus sediba" has led to its identification as close to the origin of the genus "Homo". Not all palaeoanthropologists agree this is a new species.
A new analysis shows this species had a human-like pelvis, hands and teeth, and a chimpanzee-like foot. In six separate research reports, palaeontologists reported on the anatomy of a juvenile male skeleton, MH1, a female skeleton, known as MH2, and an isolated adult tibia or shinbone, known as MH4. The findings suggest that some species of australopithecine climbed trees, some walked on the ground, and some did both. 
Colleagues in England investigated the teeth. Like other parts of the skeleton, the teeth are a mosaic of primitive and human-like features.

Marie Joséphine of Savoy

Marie Joséphine of Savoy (Maria Giuseppa Luisa Benedetta; 2 September 1753 – 13 November 1810) was the wife of the future Louis XVIII of France. She was a princess of Savoy by birth, became the titular Queen consort, and was known by her title: Her Royal Highness, Countess of Provence ("comtesse de Provence").
She was born at the Royal Palace of Turin on 2 September 1753 and was the third child and second daughter of Victor Amadeus and his wife the Spanish Infanta Maria Antonia of Spain. At the time of her birth her grandfather, Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, was the King of Sardinia. 
Maria Giuseppina was engaged to the French Prince Louis Stanislas of France. He was known as the Count of Provence. They were married on 16 April 1771 "by proxy" in the Turin. They were married in person on 14 May 1771 at the Palace of Versailles. A luxurious ball followed the wedding on 20 May. She was considered to be ugly. Louis Stanislas hated his wife. We know today that these rumors were created by those who supported Marie Antoinette as a rivalry soon emerged after the youngest brother 'comte d'Artois', married the Comtesse's sister, thereby bringing yet another Savoyard princess to Versailles and creating an Italian party at court. 
In France she was known as Marie Joséphine de Savoie. She had a high rank at court as her husband was a grandson of the reiging king. She was a cousin of the ill-fated "Princess of Lamballe" who was instrumental in the arrangement of the marriage. At the death of her husband’s grandfather Louis XV in 1774, her brother-in-law succeeded as Louis XVI. She became pregnant in 1774 and 1781, but both pregnancies ended in miscarriage. In 1791 Marie Joséphine went to Germany. During the period of exile, the Count and Countess fought constantly. Some historians have suggested Marie Joséphine's possible lesbian relationship with a lady-in-waiting as the primary cause for discord between the couple. The Countess of Valentinois was a lady-in-waiting of hers. 
Marie Joséphine died of an edema at Hartwell House, English residence of the exiled French royal family. Marie Joséphine was laid to rest in the Lady Chapel of Westminster Abbey. Her body was removed a year later on Louis's orders and buried in the Kingdom of Sardinia; today in Cagliari Cathedral.

Islam is the religion of the majority of the Palestinian population residing in the Palestinian territories, with Muslims comprising 75% of the population of the West Bank, and 99% of the population of the Gaza Strip.
Jerusalem is Islam's third holiest city after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. The "Haram al Sharif" (Temple Mount) of Jerusalem is believed by Muslims to be the location from which Muhammad ascended to Jannah (paradise); there is no mention of Jerusalem in the Koran, however.
This widely accepted Islamic belief raises the religious and spiritual importance to them of the Dome of the Rock and the adjacent al-Aqsa Mosque.

<doc id="307033" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307033" title="Specific impulse">
Specific impulse

Specific impulse (often shortened to "I") is a way to describe how well a rocket performs. It is also used to describe how well a jet engine performs. It can be used to compare rockets of different sizes. It is a way to know how much force a given engine makes for each bit of fuel. To do this, one needs to know how much fuel is in the engine. A high specific impulse means that a rocket needs less fuel to perform as well. If the specific impulse is lower, it means that the rocket needs more fuel to perform as well. 
Specific impulse is a useful value to compare rocket or jet engines. It is used much like "miles per gallon" or "litres per 100 kilometres" is used to compare cars. An engine with a higher specific impulse uses fuel better. This means that the same amount of fuel lets the rocket go faster after all fuel is depleted.
A rocket engine with a higher specific impulse doesn't mean it's 'more powerful'. That is, it will not make the rocket accelerate harder. In fact, the designs for engines with the highest specific impulse, like ion engines, are the 'weakest' of all types of engines. They accelerate the rocket slowly but steadily over a long period of time using only a tiny amount of fuel. In a race between two rockets with the same amount of fuel and two different engines the one with the more powerful engine will take an early lead, but when it burns down all its fuel, the rocket with higher specific impulse will still have some fuel left and will continue to accelerate. Eventually it will overtake its counterpart and will win the race if the distance is big enough for it to use its long-term advantage.
There are two ways people find the number for specific impulse. To find the specific impulse, one divides the impulse by the amount of fuel. Impulse is a measurement of how much force a rocket motor makes and for how long. A motor that makes a low force for a long time can sometimes have a higher impulse than a motor that makes a high force for a short time. Impulse is measured in Newtons times seconds (N*s). 
The amount of fuel used to find specific impulse can be measured in different ways. It is sometimes measured in mass and sometimes in weight. When the amount of fuel is measured in mass, the specific impulse is expressed as a speed. This is usually in meters per second. When specific impulse is measured as a speed, it has another name. It is also called the "effective exhaust velocity". The other way to measure the amount of fuel is weight. If weight is used, the specific impulse is in units of time, usually in seconds. These two ways are both common. They both compare the performance of engines.
When the specific impulse is higher, less fuel is needed to make the rocket perform at a certain level. So, a fuel is more efficient if the specific impulse is higher.
Be careful not to confuse thrust and specific impulse. Thrust is only the force made by a rocket at one point in time. Specific impulse is a measure of the force based on how much fuel there is.
When people find specific impulse, the only fuel counted is in the rocket before it gets fired. This includes the fuel and the oxidizer (the part of the fuel that helps the fuel burn). The oxidizer is sometimes oxygen, or often something else (see Rocket engine#Liquids, solids and hybrids).
Jet (airplane) engines use fuel better than rocket engines. This is because the gases do not escape as fast. Because they do not escape as fast, the exhaust does not carry away as much energy. This means that the jet engine uses a lot less energy to push the jet. It is also because the air that goes through the engine as the jet flies through the air helps the fuel to burn faster.
Specific impulse is also used to describe how well model rocket motors work. In the table below are some of Estes' claimed values for specific impulses for several of their rocket motors: Estes Industries is a large, well known American seller of model rockets and rocket parts. The specific impulse for model rocket motors is much lower than for many other rocket motors because the black powder is used as a fuel. Black powder is used in model rocket motors because it costs less. 
Here are some example numbers for larger rocket engines:
The most common way to measure specific impulse today uses seconds. This is used both in the SI (metric system) world as well as where English units are used. This way the units are identical everywhere. This means specific impulse can be used to compare engine performance in any country. Most companies that make rocket motors or jet engines use seconds to advertise their product’s performance.
The other common way to measure specific impulse is in meters per second (m/s), which is also called effective exhaust velocity. For many engines the effective exhaust velocity is different from the speed that the gases actually come out of the nozzle.

Aromatic hydrocarbon

An aromatic hydrocarbon, or arene, is a hydrocarbon ring compound. It has alternating double and single bonds between carbon atoms forming rings. Many of the compounds have a sweet scent, hence the term 'aromatic'. The ring of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds is known as a benzene ring, after the simplest possible hydrocarbon ring, benzene. Aromatic hydrocarbons can be "monocyclic" (MAH) or "polycyclic" (PAH). 
Some non-benzene-based compounds called heteroarenes, which follow Hückel's rule, are also aromatic compounds. In these compounds, at least one carbon atom is replaced by one of oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur.
Benzene, CH, is the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon and was recognized as the first aromatic hydrocarbon, with the nature of its bonding first being recognized by Kekulé in the 19th century. 
Each carbon atom in the hexagonal cycle has four electrons to share. One goes to the hydrogen atom, and one each to the two neighboring carbons. This leaves one to share with one of its two neighboring carbon atoms, which is why the benzene molecule is drawn with alternating single and double bonds around the hexagon.
The structure is also illustrated as a circle around the inside of the ring to show six electrons floating around in delocalized molecular orbitals the size of the ring itself. This also represents the equivalent nature of the six carbon-carbon bonds each equivalent to ~1.5. The electrons are visualized as floating above and below the ring with the electromagnetic fields they generate acting to keep the ring flat. 
General properties:
The circle symbol for aromaticity was introduced by Sir Robert Robinson and his student James Armit in 1925 and popularized starting in 1959 by the Morrison & Boyd textbook on organic chemistry. The proper use of the symbol is debated; it is used to describe any cyclic pi system in some publications, or only those pi systems that obey Hückel's rule on others.
A reaction that forms an arene compound from an unsaturated or partially unsaturated cyclic precursor is simply called an aromatization. Many laboratory methods exist for the organic synthesis of arenes from non-arene precursors. 
Aromatic compounds play key roles in the biochemistry of all living things. The four aromatic amino acids histidine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine each serve as one of the 20 basic building blocks of proteins. Further, all 5 nucleotides (adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil) that make up the sequence of the genetic code in DNA and RNA are aromatic purines or pyrimidines. As well as that, the molecule heme contains an aromatic system with 22 π electrons. Chlorophyll also has a similar aromatic system.
Aromatic compounds are important in industry. Key aromatic hydrocarbons of commercial interest are benzene, toluene, "ortho"-xylene and "para"-xylene. About 35 million tonnes are produced worldwide every year. They are extracted from complex mixtures obtained by the refining of oil or by distillation of coal tar. They are used to produce a range of important chemicals and polymers, including styrene, phenol, aniline, polyester and nylon.
Almost all aromatic compounds are compounds of carbon, but they need not be hydrocarbons.
In heterocyclic aromatics one or more of the atoms in the aromatic ring is of an element other than carbon. Examples include pyridine, pyrazine, imidazole, pyrazole, oxazole, thiophene, for example).
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are molecules with two or more simple aromatic rings fused together by sharing two neighboring carbon atoms. Examples are naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene.
Many chemical compounds are aromatic rings with other things attached. Examples include trinitrotoluene (TNT), acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), paracetamol, and the nucleotides of DNA.

Erich Probst

Erich Probst (5 December 1927 – 16 March 1988) was an Austrian footballer.He played as striker for different teams in Vienna and also abroad.
He started with Admira Wien being only 17 years old. After a year with Vienna he signed with SK Rapid Wien. In this time he won the Austrian Championship four times. In his first season with Rapid he scored 28 goals in 23 matches. Although he was always a top scorer he never shot the highest number of goals in the league.
After his time with Rapid he went to Wuppertaler SV in Germany. After the relegation of Wuppertal he went on to Switzerland playing for FC Zürich. In winter 1959 he came back to Austria to SV Austria Salzburg. The club paid 90 000 Austrian schillings, which was the highest till this time. He shot 15 goals and the team could stay in the top league. During his time with Salzburg he played his last match in the national football team. He was the first player of SV Austria Salzburg who ever played for the team.
In the 1960/61 season he was coach of SV Austria but not successful. So he went on to play as striker again. His last clubs were the SAK 1914 in Salzburg and First Vienna FC in Vienna. At all he scored 150 goals in Austrias top league.
He played 19 times for the Austrian national football team and scored 17 goals. His first match was on 27 May 1951 (4:0 versus Scotland) In the qualification match for the FIFA World Cup 1954 versus Portugal he scored 5 goals for the 9:1 win. He was member of the 1954 FIFA World Cup squad which reached the third place. During the tournament he scored six goals and was together with Max Morlock of Germany and Josef Hügi of Switzerland second in the scorer list. During his time abroad he was not player of the team. But in 1960 he played his last match versus France (2:4) where he also scored his last goal for the team. So he was the first national football team player coming from SV Austria Salzburg.

Yabasic (Yet Another BASIC) is an interpreter program for a version of BASIC. BASIC is a programming language. BASIC was designed by John George Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz, in 1964. However, Yabasic was born in 1995, 32 years later. Pedro Sá and Thomas Larsen are now developing version 3 of Yabasic. Yasbic is very compact at about 250 kilobytes total length.
To write something on the monitor, like Hello World, type print then "YOUR TEXT HERE".
Study this bit of code:
The result of this code is:
An audible beep is generated
The program waits for 1 second before going onto the next instruction
It then goes back to the start of the program creating an infinite loop.
This programming language can also be used to create rather complex programs such as one that calculates prime numbers
The "input" command asks the user to input a value which in this case is number that tells the program what number to stop finding prime numbers at.
The 
commands create a loop that can be repeated infinitely.
The
commands hold instructions as to what the program is to do while in the loop. 
The
commands tell the program to look for something and if the thing it is looking for is there then it reports back that it is there.

Isolobal principle

The isolobal principle (also known as isolobal analogy) is way to predict bonding properties of organometallic compounds. In organometallic chemistry, it relates the structure of organic ligands that can bind to inorganic molecular fragments. Roald Hoffmann described molecular fragments as isolobal "if the number, symmetry properties, approximate energy and shape of the frontier orbitals and the number of electrons in them are similar – not identical, but similar." One can predict the bonding and reactivity of a lesser-known pieces from that of a better-known pieces if the two molecular fragments have similar frontier orbitals, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Isolobal compounds are analogs to isoelectronic compounds that share the same number of valence electrons and structure. A graphic representation of isolobal structures, with the isolobal pairs connected through a double-headed arrow with half an orbital below, is found in Figure 1.
For his work on the isolobal analogy, Hoffmann was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1981, which he shared with Kenichi Fukui. In his Nobel Prize lecture, Hoffmann stressed that the isolobal analogy is a useful, yet simple, model. It does fail in certain instances.

Alcibiades

Alcibiades, son of Clinias, "c." 450–404 BC), was a prominent Athenian statesman, orator, and general. He was the last famous member of his mother's aristocratic family, which fell from power after the Peloponnesian War. He played a major role later in that conflict as a strategic advisor, military commander, and politician. 
During the course of the Peloponnesian War, Alcibiades changed sides on several occasions. In his native Athens in the early 410s BC, he advocated an aggressive foreign policy, and spoke in favor of an invasion of Sicily. He fled to Sparta after his political enemies brought charges of sacrilege against him. 
In Sparta, he served as a strategic adviser, proposing or supervising several major campaigns against Athens. In Sparta too, however, Alcibiades soon made powerful enemies and was forced to defect to Persia. There he served as an adviser to the satrap Tissaphernes until his Athenian political allies brought about his recall. He then served as an Athenian general for several years, but his enemies eventually succeeded in exiling him a second time.
The Sicilian Expedition was Alcibiades' idea and, had that expedition been under Alcibiades' command instead of Nicias', the expedition might not have met its disastrous fate. In the years that he served Sparta, Alcibiades played a role in Athens' undoing; the capture of Decelea and the revolts of several critical Athenian subjects occurred either at his suggestion or under his supervision. 
Once restored to his native city, however, he played a crucial role in a string of Athenian victories that eventually brought Sparta to seek a peace with Athens. He favored unconventional tactics, frequently winning cities over by treachery or negotiation rather than by siege. Alcibiades' military and political talents frequently proved valuable to whichever state he worked for. His talent for making powerful enemies ensured that he never remained in one place for long. By the end of the war (which he had helped rekindle in the early 410s) his days of political power were a bygone memory.
In his youth Alcibiades had been a pupil of Socrates. This was something which told against Socrates at his trial.

Enamorada de Ti

"Enamorada de Ti" () is a song recorded by American singer Selena. The song was written by Selena's brother who was the producer of her music A.B. Quintanilla III. The song was also written by a Selena y Los Dinos band member Pete Astudillo. It was for her second studio album "Ven Conmigo" (1990). The song is about a women who has strong emotions for a man. She exclaims that without him, she will have nothing.
The song was not an official single. However, it did peak at number 32 on the Mexican Singles Chart. The song also appealed to a younger crowd. This helped Tejano music to be liked by many young adults. Many LGBT Selena fans had done many cover versions of "Enamorada de Ti", who had been performed the song during many drag shows across America. "Enamorada de Ti" was given positive feedback from music critics. Many of them wrote about how the song was the first freestyle song to be mixed with Tejano. Selena had promoted the song on her Ven Conmigo Tour, which lasted from 1990-1992. 
"Enamorada de Ti" was recorded at JAG Records in San Antonio, Texas. The studio was rented for two days by EMI Latin for Selena to record several songs. Selena's brother, A.B. Quintanilla III had written the song. Quintanilla III had help from Pete Astudillo, who once was a backup dancer for Selena y Los Dinos. A family friend Brian "Red" Moore remixed the song. Quintanilla III had to name the song "Enmorada de Ti". By doing this, "Enamorada de Ti" became the second song by Selena to have this title. The first song that was titled "Enamorada de Ti" was on Selena's independent album "Muñequito de Trapo" (1986), which had a different meaning.
The song is about a women who is in love with a man and can not control her feelings for him. She is in love with a man who is no longer near her, she tells him that she can't live without him and that his love helps relive her depression that she has. The song is a mid-tempo song that is performed in C major with 112 beats per minute. It uses the electronic keyboard and the electric guitar as its main musical instruments. 
The song had became the first Tejano song to be in freestyle. Selena had wanted to sing songs that could appeal to younger audiences. Quintanilla III had introduced a new "type" of sound into Tejano music. This helped to attract younger people to Tejano, which was not liked before by young adults. Quintanilla III was credited and awarded for this at the Tejano Music Awards.
The song was not released as an official single, however it managed to peak at number 32 on the Mexican Singles Chart. It stood on the chart for only ten weeks. The song failed to impact any other music chart. Quintanilla III was awarded "Songwriter of the Year" for "Baila Esta Cumbia", "No Quiero Saber", "Ya Ves" and "Enamorada de Ti"; at the 1991 Tejano Music Awards. Selena promoted "Enamorada de Ti" during her Ven Conmigo Tour, which lasted from 1990-1992. She had first performed the song during the 1990 Tejano Music Awards. Javier Lopez, who is an editor for "TVyNovelas", stated that Selena's performance of the song was one of best performed dance-moves that night. 
Selena had choreographed dance moves. Selena also copied Micheal Jackson's moonwalk. She also had copied Janet Jackson's "Rhythm Nation" dance move. That night she had won "Female Vocalist of the Year" and "Female Entertainer of the Year". Selena had performed the song on the Spanish-language television show called "Bailando" in October 1992. She also had performed the song during the 1992 Lo Nuestro Awards in Miami, Florida. Her final performance was at her Los Angeles, California concert. She performed the song as her first number in November 1993.
The song has been covered by LGBT Selena fans. The song was also performed in many drag shows across the United States.
Carla Manuela Dejesus, who is an editor for "Furia Musical", stated that "Enamorada de Ti" was one of the "best freestyle-tejano songs" in Tejano history. Sebastian Rodriguez, who is an editor for "TVyNovelas", wrote that "Enamorada de Ti" was one of the best songs composed for "Ven Conmigo". He also stated that it showed people where Tejano music was heading into. Mario Tarradell, who is an editor for "The Dallas Morning News", stated that "Enamorada de Ti" is a catchy "dance-pop croker".

Maginot Line

The Maginot Line (, ) was a long line of walls, forts, and armed defenses that the French built after the First World War. It is named after André Maginot, who was the French Minister of war when it was built. The Maginot Line was made of a number of fortifications and bunkers, close to the French border to Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and Italy. Today, the fortifications towards Italy are commonly called Alpin Line. The Maginot Line was built between 1930 and 1940.
During the First World War, the German Army had built the Hindenburg Line, which is similar. 
The plan was that the French army would have time to get ready and go north to Belgium and win any battle with the German army there. In the Second World War the German army and French army met in Belgium, but the French army lost.

Alpha cleavage

Alpha cleavage, (α-cleavage) in organic chemistry, refers to the act of breaking the carbon-carbon bond, next to the carbon bearing a specified functional group.
In mass spectrometry, an α-cleavage occurs when molecules break apart within a mass spectrometer. A mass spectrum tells the size and elements found in each molecule fragment. Chemists use their understanding of how molecules break apart to guess the structure of the original molecule. Many different molecules break apart with α-cleavage inside the mass spectrometer. Many times, α-cleavage explains the resulting mass spectra.
As an example of a mechanism of alpha cleavage, an electron is knocked off an atom (usually by electron collision) to form a radical cation. Electrons are most likely to be removed in the following order: 1) lone pair electrons, 2) pi bond electrons, 3) sigma bond electrons.
One of the lone pair electrons moves down to form a pi bond with an electron from an adjacent (alpha) bond. The other electron from the bond moves to an adjacent atom (not one adjacent to the lone pair atom) creating a radical. This creates a double bond adjacent to the lone pair atom (oxygen is a good example) and breaks (cleaves) the bond that lost the two electrons that were removed.
In molecules containing carbonyl groups, alpha cleavage often competes with a McLafferty rearrangement.
In photochemistry, it is the homolytic cleavage of a bond adjacent to a specified group.

Diabetic ketoacidosis

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a medical emergency that can happen in people with diabetes mellitus. DKA happens mostly in people with Type 1 diabetes, although it may happen in some people that have Type 2 diabetes.
DKA happens when a person does not have enough insulin in their body. All of the cells in the body need glucose (sugar) to survive, because the body needs sugar to make energy. Insulin breaks down glucose into a form that the body can use for energy. Without insulin, sugar stays in the blood and cannot get into the cells. This causes high blood sugar levels and makes it impossible for the cells to use glucose to make energy.
DKA can be caused by not having enough insulin, eating too many carbohydrates, and sometimes physical or mental stress. DKA can also be a sign that a person has diabetes that has not been discovered, or is not being controlled well.
DKA is diagnosed through blood and urine testing. These tests will show high blood sugar, which does not happen with other forms of ketoacidosis.
DKA was first discovered around 1886. Before insulin therapy was first used in the 1920s, DKA almost always caused death.
Symptoms of DKA include:
As DKA gets worse, it can cause these symptoms:
Without proper treatment, DKA can cause death.
First, because there is not enough insulin to bring glucose into the cells, glucose builds up in the blood. This causes there to be too much sugar in the blood and not enough in the cells. The cells start starving, because they do not have insulin to break down glucose into a form that the cells can use for energy.
To try to create energy for the cells, the liver breaks down fat into fatty acids and ketones. These create a little bit of energy, but they are also acidic. The blood starts to get too acidic, and the body starts to get poisoned.
Because the cells still do not have enough glucose to create the energy they need, the liver also breaks down glucagon to make more glucose. (The body stores sugar in different forms in case it needs energy later. Glucagon helps break down some of these sugar stores into glucose.) However, there is still not enough insulin in the blood to break down the glucose into energy. Because of this, the glucose stays in the blood (making the blood sugar levels get even higher) and the cells keep starving.
Next, the body begins to break down protein. (When the body cannot create enough energy by breaking down fat and glucagon into sugar, it breaks down protein.) This causes the tissues in the body to lose nitrogen.
Now there is much more glucose in the bloodstream than in the cells. The body always tries to stay in homeostasis. In homeostasis, there would be an equal amount of sugar in the bloodstream and the cells. To try to make this happen, the cells (which have very little sugar in them) give up water to the blood (which is very sugary). The goal is to try to dilute the sugar in the blood, and decrease the high levels of hyperglycemia. If the cells give up too much water, they can get dehydrated (not have enough fluid left in them). Because DKA also causes a person to urinate often, a person with DKA can get dehydrated very quickly. This dehydration can be a medical emergency.
The kidneys try to filter out the extra glucose in the bloodstream. This causes glucosuria (too much sugar in the urine). The extra glucose going through the kidneys causes more urine to be created. When a person urinates more, they lose more electrolytes, like sodium and potassium. Without enough electrolytes, the heart, muscles, and nerve cells cannot work properly. Also, eventually, the kidneys can fail because they are overworked by the amount of glucose they are trying to filter.
People with DKA need to be treated in a hospital. Usually, treatment involves:

Simple aromatic rings

Simple aromatic rings, also known as simple arenes or simple aromatics, are aromatic organic compounds. They consist only of a conjugated planar ring system with delocalized pi electron clouds. Many simple aromatic rings have trivial names. They are usually found as substructures of more complex molecules ("substituted aromatics"). Typical simple aromatic compounds are benzene, indole, and cyclotetradecaheptaene.
Simple aromatic rings with non-carbon ring atoms are called "heterocyclic". For example, rings can include oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. Molecules with one ring are called monocyclic as in benzene. Molecules with two rings are called bicyclic as in naphthalene. Molecules with more than two rings are called polycyclic as in anthracene. Simple monocyclic aromatic rings are usually five-membered rings like pyrrole or six-membered rings like pyridine. Fused aromatic rings consist of monocyclic rings that share their connecting bonds.
The nitrogen (N)-containing aromatic rings can be separated into basic aromatic rings that are easily protonated, and form aromatic cations and salts (e.g., pyridinium), and non-basic aromatic rings.
In the oxygen- and sulfur-containing aromatic rings, one of the electron pairs of the heteroatoms contributes to the aromatic system (similar to the non-basic nitrogen-containing rings). The second lone pair extends in the plane of the ring (similar to the basic nitrogen-containing rings).
All of these molecules meet the following criteria:
In contrast, molecules with 4n pi electrons are antiaromatic.

Antiknock agent

An antiknock agent is added to gasoline. It reduces engine knocking and increase the fuel's octane rating.
Gasoline is a fuel mixture. High compression internal combustion engines place gasoline under great pressure. The pressure can cause the gasoline to ignite early ("pre-ignition" or "detonation") causing a damaging knocking sound, also called "pinging" or "pinking". 
Originally, organic compounds with lead were added to petrol to prevent knocking: "tetraethyllead" (TEL). This is now banned because the lead affects people's health. Various alternatives have been tried. 2,2,4-"trimethylpentane", an isomer of octane, is one example.

Adaptive Combat Rifle

The Adaptive Combat Rifle (ACR) is a fully automatic assault rifle. It was designed by Magpul Industries of Erie, Colorado. In late January 2008, Bushmaster made a licensing agreement with Magpul. In this agreement, Bushmaster would take over the making, development and sales of the ACR.
The rifle was developed over five months. It was supposed to replace the M16 rifle completely. It was also supposed to do this without money from the government. Prototypes were shown at the 2007 SHOT Show in Orlando, Florida. It was supposed to be released some time in 2008. However, Bushmaster said on May 16, 2008 that the ACR would not be released to the public until 2009. This is because Bushmaster were focusing more on military projects. On November 18, 2008, Bushmaster released a statement saying, "The ACR is being redesigned to be a superior offering to compete for the next generation US Army infantry carbine and subcompact weapon requirement and will be available to select customers in 2009."
The ACR was one of the weapons shown to the U.S. Army during an Industry Day on November 13, 2008. This Industry Day happened so that modern carbines could be looked at before it was decided what the weapon that would replace the M4 Carbine had to be like.
The first design is many recent rifle designs combined. Its designers say that it takes the best parts of each and puts them into a light, modular rifle. Some features from the Armalite AR-18, the FN SCAR, the Heckler & Koch G36/XM8, the M16/AR-15, and the M16 can be seen clearly. Experts from Magpul have said many times that depending on how long the barrel is, the amount of bullets fired is around 600-800 rounds every minute. (This is an estimate). The weapon's caliber can easily be changed by changing the bolt head, magazine and barrel.
The United States was designing a carbine to replace the M4 carbine.
Bushmaster Firearms, with help from Remington Arms (a sister company) has made many design changes. These were made to meet what the U.S. military needed. The ACR can be bought by both the military and civilians. Bushmaster says that they will soon have kits which can change the caliber of the rifle. It is expected that the ACR will be able to be bought with a choice of: 10.5″, 12.5″, 14.5″, 16″ (commercial), and 18″ barrels. One kind of ACR made by Remington has been shown as part of the Army's Individual Carbine competition.
The magazine for the 5.56mm version of the ACR rifle is called the Magpul PMag. It can hold 30 rounds. Magpul says that it is much more difficult to break or damage than other magazines. The PMag can also fit the rifles in the M16 rifle family.
The ACR was made not to break if it was exposed to things like sand, dirt, mud, and water.
It is said that the ACR will be available some time in 2010. It will be able to be bought by military, government and civilian customers. The ACR will be available in larger numbers in 2010. Bushmaster says that the rifle should cost between $2,685–$3,061.00 Semi-automatic versions will be available to civilians from Bushmaster. Remington will sell selective fire versions for the police and military.
On October 15, 2010, Bushmaster asked customers for all the ACRs back. They said: "Please immediately discontinue the use of your ACR rifle" (please immediately stop using your ACR). They also said to contact customer support. Bushmaster said that they recalled the rifles because "Bushmaster discovered a design flaw which could result in multiple rounds firing continuously when the trigger is pulled" (Bushmaster discovered a fault in the design that could mean that many rounds could be fired when the trigger is pulled). Bushmaster said that it would pay for the repairs on the rifles.

Río Alseseca

The Alseseca River is a short river in the interior part of Mexico. It is in the state of Tlaxcala. The Alseseca runs through the city of Puebla de Zaragoza. It is one of the many rivers that come from the dormant volcano La Malinche. The Alseseca river runs south-east until it enters the lake of Valsequillo.
Between 1960 and 1980, several companies set up factories in Puebla. With no protection of the river and the increasing urban growth, many companies and people threw waste into the river, which gradually became a stream of sewage. Today the pollution in the river has decreased considerably, and using it as a "garbage dump" is illegal.
Due to illegal logging in the area, deforestation has caused the river to flood in the rainy season. Since 2000, about 100 families have been affected by the overflowing of the river in villages like Aleseca and Lopez Portillo. In addition to the floods, the existing pollution in the water has caused cases of cholera and salmonella in some of the houses closest to river. Since 1995, the city government has taken action to reduce the flooding of the river. It has built barriers and dikes.

An LP record (or long-play record) is a type of gramophone record. It is a 33⅓ rpm vinyl disc with little lines called grooves that go around the center. It is generally either 10- or 12-inches in diameter. They are played by a turntable. A turntable spins the record while a lever with a small needle on the bottom. The needle goes in between the little grooves. When this happens, music is played.
The LP record was introduced by Colombia Records in 1948. It then became the new way the music industry released recordings. In the 1960s, cassettes were introduced. This was a cheaper way to record music and not hear the noise that came from the LP record. However, the LP record continued to be more popular until the 1970s when the compact disc was introduced.
The long-playing record is an analog recording format. The digital recording of sound was only made practical by the technical advances in microprocessors and computing which occurred in the 1970s and 1980s. LP's sound quality, it contains more distortion than many other modern music formats.

Always Mine

"Always Mine" is a song by American Tejano pop singer Selena. Her brother and music producer A.B. Quintanilla III wrote the song. It was for her last LP record "Dulce Amor" (1988). The song's lyrics are about teenage love and negative peer pressure from friends.
"Always Mine" was the third single off of the album. It was also released as a maxi single for "Anthology" (1998). The version found on "Anthology" was remixed with freestyle music and electronic dance music, while the version on "Dulce Amor" was Latin pop. The remix version reached number four on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart and number 94 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart in 1998.
"Always Mine" was written by Selena's brother and music producer A.B. Quintanilla III. Quintanilla III had written "Always Mine" while he was in his home in Corpus Christi, Texas. His girlfriend, at the time, told Quintanilla III that she wanted to be with him forever. She also said to him: "I want you to be always mine 'till the end of time". After Quintanilla III had finished his conversation on the phone, he then started to write down lyrics of what his girlfriend had told him.
It took Quintanilla III several hours to complete the song and presented it to Selena, who liked the lyrics of the song and had wanted to record it. Selena recorded the song in San Antonio, Texas, where most of the songs on "Dulce Amor" were recorded. During the recording sessions, Roger Garcia, a guitarist from Selena y Los Dinos, had helped Quintanilla III with writing the melody part of the song. At the time of recording, Selena was only 17 years old.
"Always Mine" was released as the third single off of "Dulce Amor" in 1988. "Always Mine" is an uptempo Latin pop song that has influences of freestyle and electronic dance music. It is written in the key of B minor with 100 beats per minute. "Always Mine"'s lyrics are about teenage love and negative peer pressure from friends. Josh Kuun of "Salon" believed the song was "'80s synth-happy freestyle" and added that "if Selena was Debbie Deb or Lisa Lisa".
The song opens with the hi-hat and drums playing at the same time to make an uptempo beat. When Selena sings the first verse of the song, the electric piano begins playing. In the opening part of "Always Mine", Selena sings that all her friends are telling her that she is a fool for liking a guy, and that she should give up on him. She then sings that many times she have indeed tried, however, because she is in love she can not go through with it. After the first melody of "Always Mine", Selena sings the second verse of the song. She sings that she had spent some time trying to think of her relationship and her friends' comments towards the relationship. However, she continues to sing that she always ends up wanting to be with him. After this, Selena sings in Spanish "Como una flor que necisita el agua/sin tu amor/se marchita mi alma" (English: Just like a flower that needs water, without your love, I have an empty soul). After the second melody part, Selena sings the chorus: "You will always be/ always mine/ be mine 'till the end of time/ always mine". Selena sings the first and second verse and the chorus once more before the song concludes.
Jose Behar, president of EMI Latin, had wanted to release an "Anthology" box-set. An "Anthology" is an album that contains a mixture of unknown songs and popular/famous songs in an artists career. Quintanilla III had remixed most of the songs included in "Anthology" and gave them a modern beat to them. "Always Mine" was chosen for the first disc entitled "Pop/English" and was chosen as an "unknown song". Quintanilla III had used electronic dance and freestyle music to mix the song. After the release of "Anthology" in 1998, Behar released a maxi single to promote the album. "Always Mine" as well as four other remixes of songs on "Anthology" were included in the maxi single.

Joseph Serchuk

Joseph Serchuk (1919 - 6 November 1993) was the commander of the Jewish partisan unit in the Lublin area in Poland during the Holocaust. After the war, he testified at trials of Nazis and he received special recognition from the State of Israel.
After his parents and other family members were killed in the ghetto in 1941, Joseph and his brother David were taken to Sobibor extermination camp. After one day in the camp, he fled with his brother to the nearest forest and together with others fleeing he founded the core of the partisan group. During the war, the group led by Jews who had escaped from the ghettos caught nearby and from Sobibor. The group also included the writer Dov Freiberg.
After the war, Joseph took part in locating fleeing Nazi war criminals in Europe, and served as a witness in the Nuremberg Trials. Then he returned to Poland and applied to emigrate to Israel, but was declined.
In 1950, Serchuk obtained a passport and went to Israel. Immediately upon arrival in Israel, he was drafted as a soldier in the army. After service, he married, settled in Yad Eliyahu in Tel Aviv and began business industry and entrepreneurship.
Over the years, Serchuk went to Europe several times to testify in the trials of Nazi war criminals. In one, the trial of Oberscharführer Hugo Raschendorfer, he was the only prosecution witness. After Raschendorfer was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, Serchuk was awarded a special award from Nazi Crimes Investigation Department of the Israel Police.
In 1967, Levi Eshkol, the Israeli Prime Minister, gave him the Fighters against Nazis Medal, and in 1968 he received in addition the State Fighters Medal.
He saw the establishment and strengthening of the Israel Defense Forces and the State of Israel and the Jewish birthrate - his revenge against the Nazis who slaughtered all of his extended family.
Joseph Serchuk died in 1993 in Tel Aviv at age 74. He was married, and left behind nine children and more than one hundred grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Angry Birds

Angry Birds is a puzzle video game developed by Rovio Mobile from Finland. In the game there are wingless birds. The player uses a slingshot to launch them at pigs that are on or in different structures. The player has to destroy all the pigs in the map to unlock another level. A spin off game, in which you play as the pigs, was also released called Bad Piggies.
There are several kinds of wingless birds and green pigs in "Angry Birds":
There are pigs with and without helmets, small and big pigs, pigs with and without moustaches, and the pig’s king. They are all green.
Rovio Mobile has supported their games with many free updates that add more features and levels. There are 7 themed groups of levels. Every group has a simple story, the pigs stole the birds’ eggs so they try to get them back.The birds eventually get the eggs back in every part.
Types of Birds:
Types of Pigs (strongest to weakest):
The first version of this game was released in December 2009 for Apple’s mobile operating system iOS (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch). That release was a huge success so they decided to make versions for other mobile platforms (Maemo, webOS, Android, Symbian, Series 40 and Windows Phone). They also made versions even for computer operating systems (Mac OS, Windows) and gaming consoles (PlayStation, Xbox 360). There is also a version for Google’s social network Google Plus.
Because so many people liked this game, Rovio Mobile released special editions of "Angry Birds" called "Angry Birds Seasons", "Angry Birds Rio" and "Angry Birds Magic". The special versions are basically the same game with some differences. In "Angry Birds Seasons" there are levels inspired by holidays or seasons. "Angry Birds Rio" is set in Rio de Janeiro and instead of pigs and wingless birds there are monkeys and birds from the movie "Rio". "Angry Birds Magic" is just a special edition for Nokia and for more levels you have to use NFC.
From December 2009 to November 2011 people downloaded more than 500 million copies of this game. It is the number one game in 79 countries. People played 266 billion levels and shot 400 billion birds. They played 200,000 years of "Angry Birds" in total and 300 million minutes daily.

<doc id="307223" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307223" title="Fishmonger">
Fishmonger

A fishmonger is someone who sells fish and seafood. Fishmongers can be wholesalers or retailers. In many places there are fewer fishmongers than there used to be. Supermarkets have often replaced independent seafood sellers. Female fishmongers used to have a separate name, fishwife.
The fishmongers guild, was started in the City of London by a Royal Charter from Edward I soon after he became king in 1272. Guild members could not have foreign partners. Selling fish was tightly controlled to make sure it was fresh and to keep profits low. However, the guild grew rich. After Edward's victory over the Scots, they put on a great show, including one thousand mounted knights.
While Edward II was king, the fishmongers lost political power. Parliament made a rule that a fishmonger could not become mayor of the city. This rule was soon canceled, though. The fishmongers guild became richer so that while Edward III was king the guild could give £40 to the war against the French. This was a large amount of money at that time.
The guild was then reformed as the "Mystery of the Fishmongers of London". They were the only ones allowed to advertise or sell fish. They also regulated catching fish in the Thames. The river had many fish such as salmon at that time. The guild still continues today as one of the Great Twelve City Livery Companies.
Some believe that the word fishmonger in Shakespeare's "Hamlet" was a euphemism for a "fleshmonger," or pimp. 
In the English translation of the Asterix series, the village fishmonger is called Unhygienix. 
In the film "The Beach", the island's chef has only fish for meat, and is named Unhygienix after to the Asterix character.
Charles Fort included the story of the Mad Fishmonger or "St. Fishmonger" in his book "Lo!" According to the story St. Fishmonger made crabs and periwinkles fall from the sky. The story later appears in the "Schrödinger's Cat Trilogy" by Robert Anton Wilson. 
Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger is a writer and artist active in the Church of the Subgenius.
In many countries, the fishwife had a reputation for speaking boldly. In Medieval France, fishwives in Paris were allowed to speak honestly and directly to the King himself when he went into the marketplace. They could be critical without fear of punishment.

<doc id="307224" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307224" title="Deep frying">
Deep frying

Deep frying is a way of cooking food by putting it in hot oil or fat. Deep frying cooks food very quickly.
If done well, deep-frying does not make food too greasy, because the moisture in the food repels the oil. The hot oil heats the water in the food, steaming it from the inside out. The water vapor pushes the bubbles toward the surface of the oil. As long as the oil is hot enough and the food is not in the oil for too long, oil will only enter the surface of the food. However, if the food is cooked in the oil for too long, much of the water will be lost and the oil will begin to penetrate the food. The correct frying temperature depends on the thickness and type of food, but is usually between 175 and 190 °C (345–375 °F). 
Some fried foods are given a coating of batter or breading prior to frying. This makes the outside of the food crispy and browned, while the inside becomes tender, moist, and steamed. Some foods – such as potatoes or whole, skin-on poultry – have a natural coating and do not require breading or battering.
Deep frying makes large amounts of waste oil. Getting rid of the oil properly may be a problem. Waste oil is increasingly being recycled into biodiesel.
Some deep fry shortenings contain trans fat.
Cooking oil can burn well and may catch fire if it is used at too high a temperature. Trying to put out an oil fire with water makes the fire worse. Instead, oil fires must be put out with a fire extinguisher or by smothering.

George Andrew Olah

George Andrew Olah (born May 22, 1927 in Budapest, as Oláh György) is an American chemist. His research involves the generation and reactivity of carbocations using superacids. For this research, Olah was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1994. The American Chemical Society gave him its highest honor, the Priestley Medal.
Olah was born in Budapest, Hungary, on May 22, 1927. He studied high school at Budapesti Piarista Gimnazium (Scolopi fathers). He studied, then taught, at what is now Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Following the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, he and his family moved briefly to England, They then moved to Canada. He joined Dow Chemical in Sarnia, Ontario, with another Hungarian chemist, Stephen J. Kuhn. During Olah's eight years with Dow, he started to study carbocations. In 1965, he left Dow for Case Western Reserve University. He joined the University of Southern California faculty in 1977. In 1971, Olah became a naturalized citizen of the United States.
Olah is currently a distinguished professor at the University of Southern California and the director of the Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute. In 2005, Olah wrote an essay promoting the methanol economy.
The Olah family formed an endowment fund (the George A. Olah Endowment). It grants annual awards to outstanding chemists. The American Chemical Society selects and administers the awards.
The search for stable carbocations led to the discovery of protonated methane. (Protonated methane is a methane molecule (CH) with an extra proton giving it a positive charge.) Protonated methane was stabilized by superacids, like FSOH-SbF ("Magic Acid"). 
Olah also studied how hydrocarbons are used as fuel.
Olah also disagreed for many years with Herbert C. Brown of Purdue University over the existence of so-called "nonclassical" carbocations – such as the norbornyl cation. They can be shown as cationic character shared (delocalized) over several bonds.
In recent years, his research has shifted from hydrocarbons (including hydrocarbon fuel) to the methanol economy. He has joined with Robert Zubrin, Anne Korin, and James Woolsey in calling for a Flexible-fuel vehicle mandate initiative.

<doc id="307247" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307247" title="Eigenvalues and eigenvectors">
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

Linear algebra talks about functions, which are often called transformations. In that context, an eigenvector is a vector—different from the null vector—which does not change direction in the transformation (except if it turns the vector exactly around). The vector may change its length, or become null. The value of the change in length of the vector is known as eigenvalue.
If there exists a square matrix called A, a scalar "λ, and a non-zero vector v, then λ" is the Eigenvalue and v is the Eigenvector if the following equation is satisfied:
In other words, if matrix "A" times the vector v is equal to the scalar "λ" times the vector v, then "λ" is the eigenvalue of v, where v is the eigenvector.
An eigenspace of "A" is the set of all eigenvectors with the same eigenvalue together with the zero vector. However, the zero vector is not an eigenvector.
These ideas often are extended to more general situations, where scalars are elements of any field, vectors are elements of any vector space, and linear transformations may or may not be represented by matrix multiplication. For example, instead of real numbers, scalars may be complex numbers; instead of arrows, vectors may be functions or frequencies; instead of matrix multiplication, linear transformations may be operators such as the derivative from calculus. These are only a few of countless examples where eigenvectors and eigenvalues are important.
In cases like these, the idea of "direction" loses its ordinary meaning, and has a more abstract definition instead. But even in this case, if that abstract "direction" is unchanged by a given linear transformation, the prefix "eigen" is used, as in "eigenfunction", "eigenmode", "eigenface", "eigenstate", and "eigenfrequency".
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors have many applications in both pure and applied mathematics. They are used in matrix factorization, in quantum mechanics, facial recognition systems, and in many other areas.
For the matrix "A"
the vector 
is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. Indeed,
On the other hand the vector 
is "not" an eigenvector, since
and this vector is not a multiple of the original vector x.

Superacid

A superacid is an acid with an acidity greater than that of 100% pure sulfuric acid. According to the modern definition, a superacid has a chemical potential of the proton higher than that of pure sulfuric acid.
Chemists use strong acids to break down other molecules. Some molecules are so strong (held together with strong chemical bonds) that they resist attack by common acids. Supercids can break down molecules that stand up to most other acids.
Commercially available superacids include trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (CFSOH), also known as triflic acid, and fluorosulfonic acid (FSOH). Both acids are about a thousand times stronger (that is, have more negative "H" values) than sulfuric acid. The strongest superacids are prepared by the combination of two components, a strong Lewis acid and a strong Brønsted acid. The strongest known superacid is fluoroantimonic acid.

Sick building syndrome

Sick building syndrome (SBS) is a combination of illnesses (a syndrome) associated with a human's place of work (office building) or dwelling. A 1984 World Health Organization report into suggested up to 30% of new and remodeled buildings around the world may be linked to symptoms of SBS. Most of the sick building syndrome is related to poor indoor air quality.
SBS can be caused by flaws in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Other causes have been contaminants produced by outgassing of some types of building materials, volatile organic compounds (VOC), molds (see mold health issues), improper exhaust ventilation of ozone (byproduct of some office machinery), using light industrial chemicals in the building, or lack of adequate fresh-air intake/air filtration (see Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value).
People try to fix SBS symptoms by increasing the overall turn-over rate of fresh air exchange between the building's air and the outside air. But the new green building design goals should be able to avoid most of the SBS sources in the first place. Janitors should minimize the ongoing use of VOC cleaning compounds, and eliminate conditions that encourage allergenic, potentially-deadly mold growth.
Building occupants complain of symptoms such as irritation of the eyes, nose, throat; neurotoxic or general health problems; skin irritation; nonspecific hypersensitivity reactions; and odor and taste sensations.
Several sick occupants may report individual symptoms which do not appear to be connected. The key to discovery SBS is if a number of people first experience their illnesses within a period of weeks. In most cases, SBS symptoms will be relieved soon after the occupants leave the particular room or zone. However, there can be lasting effects of various neurotoxins, which may not clear up when the occupant leaves the building. Sensitive individuals can have long-term health effects.
The following steps can avoid SBS:
There might be a gender difference in reporting rates of sick building syndrome because women tend to report more symptoms than men. Along with this, some studies found that women have a more responsive immune system and are more prone to mucosal dryness and facial erythema. Also, women are alleged by some to be more exposed to indoor environmental factors, because they have a tendency to have more clerical work where they are exposed to unique office equipment and materials (example: blueprint machines), while men may more often have jobs based outside of offices.

Automatic firearm

An automatic firearm is a firearm which will keep firing as long as the trigger is being pulled and there is still ammunition in the magazine.
An automatic weapon works by firing, automatically removing the cartridge case from the chamber, ejecting it from the side of the gun, and then loads a new cartridge into the chamber.
An "automatic pistol" or "automatic shotgun" usually means that it has a semi-automatic design. However, fully automatic pistols (for example the Steyr TMP) and shotguns (such as the Daewoo USAS-12) exist. "Automatic rifle" usually means that the rifle has a fully automatic design, not semi-automatic.
In large countries, automatic firearms can usually only be used by the military and police. In countries where automatic firearms can be used by the public, there are usually very strict rules on their use.
A fully automatic weapon (a machine gun) is one that keeps firing bullets as long as the trigger is pulled. It stops when the trigger is let go or the ammunition runs out. Also, any weapon that shoots more than one shot at a time when the trigger is pulled once is legally called a machine gun.
Submachine guns are fully automatic weapons that fire a pistol cartridge. They can also be used by only one person. Sometimes they are called machine pistols.

Player-coach

A player-coach, in sports, is a member of a sports team who simultaneously holds both playing and coaching duties. The term can be used to refer to both players who serve as head coaches, or as assistant coaches.
Player/manager is a sports term used to described a manager of a team who is also registered to play for the team. In association football, this situation usually arises when a manager leaves a team suddenly, and the chairman has to make a quick decision to appoint someone new as a caretaker manager. The chairman will usually either ask a coach to take temporary charge or turn to the club's most senior player. If this particular player gains good results for the team during his time in charge, he may be appointed full-time manager, which leaves him a player/manager.
However, there are instances when a free agent is signed by a new team as a manager and offers his playing abilities.
In the United States, player/managers and player-coaches were once common, especially in the early days of baseball. The last player-manager in Major League Baseball was Pete Rose, who began managing the Cincinnati Reds in 1985, the second-to-last season of his playing career. Fred Clarke spent the longest time as a player-manager.

Top batsmen will have separate averages for test cricket, first class cricket, one-day cricket and so on. The highest batting average is by Sir Donald Bradman which is 99.96.
In baseball, the batting average (BA) is defined as the number of hits divided by at bats. For example, if a player had 50 hits over 175 at bats, their batting average would be .286.

New World rats and mice

The New World rats and mice are a group of rodents from the family Cricetidae. They are mammals with fur and long tails. These animals live in the wild in North and South America. The group is very large, with about 500 different species. Biologists are not sure whether the group is descended from a common ancestor, so there is no scientific name for it. There are three subfamilies, Neotominae, Sigmodontinae and Tylomyinae.
Members of the New World rats and mice have occupied different ecological niches. Because of this, they have developed different forms. Most of them resemble rats or mice in appearance, but some look like voles, moles, gerbils or shrews. The biggest of them are Kunsia, with about 16–30 cm body length, and about 8–16 cm tail. Among the smallest are Baiomys, with about 5–8 cm body length, and about 5 cm tail.
Most of the New World rats and mice live on the ground, but are good climbers. Some live in trees. Others dig holes in the ground, or live part of their life in the water. New world rats and mice do not hibernate, but on cold days in winter, they sometimes fall into a torpor.
The New World rats and mice have many predators, and usually live only a short time. In the wild, these animals usually live for less than a year, but they have reached ages of up to five years old when kept indoors and protected by people. Some species have adapted to humans, and are hemerophile. This has also shown in some common names, such as the Cotton rat, Marsh rice rat, Brown Cane Mouse or Short-tailed Cane Mouse.

INDO stands for Intermediate Neglect of Differential Overlap. It is a semi-empirical quantum chemistry method that is a development of the complete neglect of differential overlap (CNDO/2) method developed by John Pople. Like CNDO/2 it uses zero-differential overlap for the two-electron integrals. Integrals for over orbitals centered on the same atom are included in the INDO method.
The method is now rarely used in its original form. But it is the basis for several other methods, such as MINDO, ZINDO and SINDO.

Wiswesser Line Notation, also referred to as WLN, was the first line notation that precisely describes complex molecules. The notation is simple, so that trained chemists as well as computers can translate it. It was invented by William J. Wiswesser in 1949.
The keypunch was the main data entry device when WLN was developed. Keypunches could only type capital letters, numbers, and a few special characters. So, the symbols used in WLN were limited so that they could be stored on punched cards.

The Winter's Tale

The Winter's Tale is a play by William Shakespeare, published in the First Folio, in 1623. It was grouped among the comedies, but some modern editors have relabelled the play as one of Shakespeare's late romances. Some critics, among them W. W. Lawrence, consider it to be one of Shakespeare's "problem plays", because the first three acts are filled with intense psychological drama, while the last two acts are comedic and supply a happy ending. 
Despite this, the play has been popular, and there are different adaptations of it to the stage. The first was done by David Garrick in his adaptation called "Florizel and Perdita"; first performed in 1754 and published in 1756. "The Winter's Tale" was revived again in the 19th century, when the third "pastoral" act was widely popular). In the second half of the 20th century "The Winter's Tale" was often performed as a whole. The text was usually taken from the First Folio.

Remipedia

Remipedia is a class of blind crustaceans found in coastal aquifers. So long as the water is salty, these little animals can be found.
They are found in almost every ocean basin so far explored, including in Australia, the Caribbean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean. 
The first described remipede was a fossil called "Tesnusocaris goldichi" (early Pennsylvanian). Since 1979 at least 17 living species have been identified. They live in the neo-tropical zone.
Remipedes are long. They have a head and a long trunk of up to forty-two similar body segments. The swimming appendages are on the sides of each segment, and the animals swim on their backs. They are generally slow-moving. 
They have fangs connected to secretory glands; it is still unknown whether these glands secrete digestive juices or poisonous venom, or whether remipedes feed primarily on detritus or on living organisms. They have a primitive body plan in crustacean terms, and may be a basal, ancestral crustacean group. 
At least one species, "Godzilliognomus frondosus", has an organised brain, with a particularly large olfactory area. Species which live in dark environments need to detect scents in the water. The size and complexity of the brain suggested that Remipedia might be the sister taxon to Malacostraca, regarded as the most advanced of the crustaceans.

Maxillopoda

Maxillopoda is a diverse class of crustaceans which includes the barnacles, copepods and a number of related animals.
It does not appear to be a monophyletic group, and no single character unites all the members.
With the exception of some barnacles, maxillopodans are mostly small, including the smallest known arthropod, "Stygotantulus stocki". They often have short bodies, with the abdomen reduced in size, and generally lacking any appendages  This may have arisen through paedomorphosis.
Apart from barnacles, which use their legs for filter feeding, most maxillopodans feed with their maxillae. Their bodyplan has 5 head segments, 6 thoracic segments and 4 abdominal segments, followed by a telson (tailpiece).
The fossil record of the group extends back into the Cambrian, with fossils of barnacles and tongue worms known from that period.
Six subclasses are generally recognised, although many works have included the ostracods among the Maxillopoda. Of the six groups, only Mystacocarida are entirely free-living; all the members of the Tantulocarida, Pentastomida and Branchiura are parasitic, and many of the Copepoda and Thecostraca are parasites.

Cephalocarida

Cephalocarida is a class inside the subphylum Crustacea that has only twelve shrimp-like benthic species. They were discovered in 1955, and are commonly referred to as horseshoe shrimps. 
All cephalocaridans are in just one family: Hutchinsoniellidae. Even though there is no fossil record of cephalocaridans, most specialists believe them to be basal (primitive) among crustaceans.
These crustaceans are from in length, with a long body. They have no eyes, and live in a muddy natural habitat.
The structural and functional similarity between the maxillae and the legs may be a sign of primitive organization; the maxillae are not specialized, as they are in other crustaceans.
The thorax consists of 10 segments, and the abdomen bears a telson but no other appendages.
Cephalocaridans are found from the intertidal zone down to a depth of 1500 metres, in all kinds of sediments. They feed on marine detritus. To bring in food particles, they make water currents with the thoracic appendages like the branchiopods and the malacostracans. Food particles are passed forward along a ventral groove, leading to the mouthparts.

Dulce Amor Tour

The Dulce Amor Tour was the seventh small concert tour by American singer Selena. The tour was to promote her seventh independent LP record "Dulce Amor" (1988). The tour began on November 26, 1988 in Corpus Christi, Texas. The concert ended on July 26, 1989 in Houston, Texas. Selena had sung a lot of covers during this tour. She also had begun designing her own clothing. 
Selena was inspired by Janet Jackson, Madonna and Paula Abdul for designing her own clothing. Selena was inspired by Michael Jackson for dance moves that she could perform. In some concerts, Selena was underpaid by venues across Texas. She was not paid fairly because she was a female lead-singer in a male-dominated genre. Selena had food thrown at her by Tejano fans at one of her concerts. 
The concert tour had grossed only $4,500. The concert ended because of angry fans and because Selena was being promoted to EMI Latin.
The Dulce Amor Tour started on November 26, 1988 in Corpus Christi, Texas, Selena's hometown. The tour was also her last independent tour before signing a contract with EMI Latin. Selena had asked her father, Abraham Quintanilla Jr, if she could design the band's clothing. Her father did not want her to choose the band's clothing. However, he did give her permission to design her own clothing. 
Selena had inspiration from Madonna, Paula Abdul and Janet Jackson. She also had inspiration for dance moves from Micheal Jackson and other popular 1980s singers. When the tour had begun, Selena had performed more cover versions then her own songs. Selena felt that she should sing popular music to help the band become more popular. The concerts had usually lasted for an hour and a half. 
Selena was paid only $150 for each concert. However, some venues underpaid Selena because she was a female lead-singer in a male-dominated genre. Venues who booked Selena felt that she would never become a huge successful singer. Some even laughed at Selena's father for even promoting her. During several concerts, food was thrown at Selena by Tejano fans. 
Selena was discriminated against and was not allowed to perform at some venues. However, the Dulce Amor Tour became the most successful tour in Selena's early career. This was because, more venues had booked Selena to perform and attendance to her concerts were growing. The Dulce Amor Tour had grossed $4,500. 
In some concerts such as the December 10, 1988 Dallas, Texas concert, Selena had performed "Tú Solamente Tú", "Qué", "Soy Amiga", "Dame Tu Amor", "Dame Un Beso" and "A Million To One". In this concert, she only had done two covers that night. 
On February 20, 1989, Selena performed in Odessa, Texas. Her concert had ended early because Tejano fans were throwing food at Selena. Selena only got to perform "Costumbres", "Quisiera Darte", "I Like It", "No More Lies" and "Dulce Amor". Selena and her band were taken back to their tour bus. The club owner did not pay Selena. He felt that he now needed the money to clean up the mess. He also banned Selena to ever perform again at his venue until 1994, after she had won a Grammy Award.

PPSh-41

The PPSh-41 ("Pistolet-Pulemyot Shpagina"; ; "Shpagin machine pistol") is a Soviet submachine gun. It was designed by Georgi Shpagin. The PPSh-41 was supposed to be a cheaper, simpler gun to use than the PPD-40. The PPD-40 was in Soviet service at that time. The PPSh-41 officially replaced the PPD-40 in 1941. The PPSh-41 was supposed to be used by conscripted soldiers with very little training. The PPSh-41 got its ammunition from a magazine. It was also a selective fire submachine gun. It was made mostly of stamped steel. It fired the 7.62×25mm pistol round. The PPSh-41 was used a lot during World War II and the Korean War, as it was the most produced SMG throughout the wars. It was still in use in Vietnam with the Viet Cong as late as 1970 as the Chinese Type 50 (a copy). There were even some PPSh-41's captured by US soldiers as late as the Iraq War.
The idea for the development of the PPSh-41 came partly from the Winter War against Finland. It was found in this war that submachine guns were good weapons for close-quarters combat. The PPSh-41 was developed in mid-1941. It was made in many factories in Moscow. Local Party members were made responsible for making sure enough PPSh-41s were made.
A few hundred weapons were made in November 1941. Another 155,000 were made over the next five months. By spring 1942, PPSh-41 factories were making around 3,000 weapons a day. The PPSh-41's design was good, as it allowed many weapons to be made in a short amount of time (mass production). Other examples of this kind of design were the M3 submachine gun, MP40 and the Sten. Its parts (except the barrel) could be made by unskilled workers. The PPSh-41 used 87 parts, and the PPD-40 used 95. The PPSh-41 could be made in 7.3 hours. However, the PPD-40 took 13.7 hours. The making of the barrel was often made simpler by using barrels made for the M1891 Mosin–Nagant rifle. The rifle barrel was cut in half. From this one rifle barrel, two PPSh-41 barrels were made. The barrel was then altered for the 7.62mm Soviet submachine gun cartridge. 
The PPSh-41 was popular in the German armies as well. Captured PPSh-41s were often used by the Germans against their enemies. It was so popular among German soldiers, in fact, that it was the second most used SMG among German forces in WWII. 
After the German Army captured a lot of PPSh-41s during World War II, a program was started. In this program, the weapons would be altered to fire the German submachine gun bullet, the 9mm Parabellum. The Wehrmacht officially called these PPSh-41s the MP41(r). PPSh-41s which were not altered were called the MP717(r). They were given 7.63x25mm Mauser ammunition instead of the Soviet 7.62x25mm bullet. The German military made German-language manuals to teach soldiers how to use the PPSh-41. These were printed and given out across the Wehrmacht.
The Soviet Union also tried the PPSh-41 in close air support. They put dozens of PPSh-41s on some of their planes.
Over 6 million PPSh-41s were made by the end of the war. After the Battle of Stalingrad, they became the most used small arms in the Red Army. The Soviets would often give whole regiments or even divisions the PPSh-41. This gave them excellent close-range power.
After the war, a large number of PPSh-41s were given to Soviet client states. They were also handed out to communist guerillas. The North Korean People's Army (NKPA) and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) fighting in Korea got huge amounts of PPSh-41s. They were also given the North Korean Type 49 and the Chinese Type 50. These were copies of the PPSh-41s with small changes. The PPSh-41 was used a lot during the entire Korean War. Though it was not very accurate, the PPSh-41 did well in close-range battles because of its extremely high rate of fire and its high ammo capacity. These often happened in the Korean War, especially at night. United Nations forces often had trouble with returning enough bullets when they were attacked by communists with the PPSh-41. Some U.S. infantry officers said that the PPSh-41 was the best gun of the war. It was not as accurate as the U.S. M1 Garand or M1 carbine. However, it gave more power at close range.
The PPSh-41 fired the 7.62x25mm (Tokarev) bullet. The 7.62x25mm was the main Soviet pistol and submachine gun bullet. The PPSh-41 weighed around 12 pounds (5.45 kg) with a full 71-round magazine. It weighed 9.5 pounds (4.32 kg) with a loaded 35-round magazine. The PPSh-41 could fire 900 rounds per minute. This was very high compared to other submachine guns of World War II. The PPSh-41 did not have a grip on it. Because of this, the soldier usually had to hold the PPSh-41 behind the drum magazine. The soldier could also hold the bottom of the drum. 35-round box magazines could have been used from 1942. However, Soviet soldiers in World War II usually kept the 71-round drum magazine.
The PPSh-41 drum magazine was a copy of the Finnish M31 Suomi magazine. It held 71 rounds. The drum magazine was slower and more difficult to load with ammunition than the box magazine. The box magazine began to be used more after 1942. Even though it had less bullets in it, the box magazine made it easier to hold the weapon. It was possible that the PPSh-41 would fire bullets if it was dropped on a hard surface. This was because of its open bolt design.
Because the Germans had captured so many PPSh-41s, a program was started. In this program, the weapons would be altered to fire the German submachine gun bullet. This bullet was called the 9mm Parabellum. The Wehrmacht officially called these PPSh-41s the MP41(r). PPSh-41s which were not altered were called the MP717(r). They were given 7.63x25mm Mauser ammunition instead of the Soviet 7.62x25mm bullet. The German military made German-language manuals to teach soldiers how to use the PPSh-41. These were printed and given out across the Wehrmacht.
During World War II, an even simpler submachine gun was brought in to service. It was called the PPS-43. However, it did not replace the PPSh-41 during the war.

Die Deutschen Inschriften

The Academies of Sciences in Mainz and Göttingen planed and carried the project "Deutsche Inschriften Online" (English: German Inscriptions Online) out. The project's ambition was to digitalize the volumes DI 66/45/56/58/61 and make them available online. The realisation is based on a database who was developed by the Inscription-offices in Greifswald and Mainz. The venture has an innovative character. It is seeing itself as a broadening of the project "Inschriften Mittelrhein-Hunsrück (IMH)" (English: Inscriptions of the Middlerhine-Hunsrück). The IMH-Project was worked out in 2008. The "Institut für Geschichtliche Landeskunde an der Universität Mainz" (English: Institute for Regional History at the University of Mainz) took part in working out the IMH-Project. The project digitalized the volume "Die Inschriften des Rhein-Hunsrück Kreises I (DI 60)" (English: The Inscriptions of the Rhine-Hunsrück District) edited by epigraphist Eberhard J. Nikitsch. In the meantime the website of the IMH-Project has merged into the DIO-Web portal. In the long run digitalization and making available online of further volumes is scheduled. Also a translation of the DIO-Website into the English language is projected.
Besides the digitalized volumes DIO features an elaborated search interface, news concerning epigraphy and series of articles. The series featured are "Epigraphischer Tipp" (English: Epigraphical Hint) and "Inschrift im Fokus" (English: Focused on Inscription). There are also a glossary and a list of topical weblinks. Additionally the site presents a wide array of photographs and pictures of inscriptions or things alike. By this means the publishers try to interweave different alternatives of presenting information to the public.
Today twelve volumes including more than 4170 items and more than 4000 illustrations and photographs can be retrieved by the user. Currently online available are the volumes DI-19 Göttingen (City), DI-28 Hameln, DI-36 Hannover, DI-42 Einbeck, DI-45 Goslar, DI-56 Braunschweig, DI-58 Hildesheim, DI-60 Rhein-Hunsrück-Kreis I, DI-61 Helmstedt, DI-66 Göttingen (District), DI-46 Minden, The Inscriptions of the City of Mainz.

Bidi Bidi Bom Bom

"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" is a song by American singer Selena.
Before "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" was written, Selena had performed cover versions of popular songs while on tour. While touring on the Entre A Mi Mundo Tour, Selena had decided to perform a song she had recently written. The song was called "Little Bidi Bubbles", "Little Bubbles" and "Swim Swim Swim!" The song was in English and had talked about a fish swimming in the ocean happily. The fish was given only one wish and had decided to give that wish away to another fish she had really liked. The song was performed in the style of roots reggae mixed with cumbia music. The song had became a sound check for Selena y Los Dinos, after Selena had written the song. Initially, Selena had wanted to perform the song to her fans and see their reactions before she would professionally record it. The song was not recorded even though it was given positive feedback from fans. 
A.B. Quintanilla III, Selena's brother, was short on songs to be recorded for Selena's next studio album. A.B had wanted to record an "exotic progressive" album that would help Selena to expand her fan base even bigger. He then decided to finish writing "Little Bidi Bubbles" and turn it into a Caribbean reggae song mixed with Colombian cumbia to attract fans from the Caribbean. Pete Astudillo, a former back-up dancer for the band, also helped with writing the song. Chris Perez, the widower of Selena, had brought Rock fusion and guitar solos into the song. The song was written in Spanish and was produced by A.B., Selena's father Abraham Quintanilla Jr and Bebu Silvetti. Brian "Red" Moore, a family friend, had mixed the song. Roger Emerson became the music arranger for the song. "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" was recorded in Q-Productions in Corpus Christi, Texas.
Around the early months of 1994, the lyrics of the song was finished. Selena had recorded the song a few weeks afterwards. A.B. told interviewers that he was afraid and nervous about releasing the song because of its mixed music genres. He also said that the use of mixed genres had never been done before for a Tejano singer. After "Amor Prohibido" (1994) was released, EMI Latin had a hard time choosing a lead single. Selena and the record company had wanted "Amor Prohibido" as the lead single, whereas A.B. had wanted "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom". A.B. had tried to convince his sister and EMI, but was unsuccessful. "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" had then became a promotional single for the album.
When Selena was killed on March 31, 1995, she was in the middle of releasing a crossover album. EMI Latin and Selena's family had decided to release it on July 18 of that same year. However, since the album was not finished, they were short on songs. A.B. had then made a few remix versions of Selena's most popular and famous songs, one of them being "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom", which were included in "Dreaming of You" (1995).

A Boy Like That

"A Boy Like That" is a popular Broadway song. "A Boy Like That" (originally "A Boy Like That/I Have A Love") was written by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim for the musical play, "The West Side Story" (1957). The song was performed by Chita Rivera (Anita) and Carol Lawrence (Maria). In the 1960 movie version the roles were played by Rita Moreno and Natalie Wood, but the songs were dubbed by Betty Wand and Marni Nixon (as both Anita and Maria). 
In 1995, after attending the Grammy Awards, Selena was asked to participate in the AIDS Project Los Angeles. She accepted because she had loved to do charity work and give back to her community, for which she was famous for being "down-to-Earth". Selena recorded the song as a rhythm and blues, funk song. It was released after Selena was murdered for the various artists album in 1997.

Biophysical chemistry

Biophysical chemistry studies biological systems. It is a relatively new branch of chemistry. It looks for explanations of the various phenomena in biological systems in terms of either the molecules that make up the system or the supra-molecular structure of these systems. 
Biophysical chemists employ various tools used in physical chemistry to probe the structure of biological systems. These tools include spectroscopic methods like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray diffraction. For example, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2009 was based on x-ray diffraction studies of ribosomes.
Biophysical chemists study protein structure and the functional structure of cell membranes. For example, enzyme action can be explained in terms of the shape of a pocket in the protein molecule that matches the shape of the substrate molecule or its modification due to binding of a metal ion. Similarly, biophysical chemists study the structure and function of the biomembranes using model supramolecular structures. These include liposomes or phospholipid vesicles of different compositions and sizes.
The oldest well-known institute for biophysical chemistry is Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen. The Biophysics Department of King's College London is where the X-ray crystallography studies of DNA was done in the early 1950s.

Bioinorganic chemistry

Bioinorganic chemistry studies the role of metals in biology. It also studies natural phenomena such as the behaviour of metalloproteins and artificially introduced metals in medicine and toxicology. Many biological processes such as respiration depend on some inorganic molecules. Bioinorganic chemistry also includes the study of inorganic models or mimics that imitate the way metalloproteins work.
It is a mix of biochemistry and inorganic chemistry. Bioinorganic chemistry studies the implications for biology of electron-transfer proteins, substrate bindings and activation, atom and group chemistry as well as metal properties.
Paul Ehrlich used organoarsenic (“arsenicals”) for the treatment of syphilis. This demonstrated the relevance of metals, or at least metalloids, to medicine. Then Rosenberg discovered the anti-cancer activity of cisplatin (cis-PtCl(NH)). The first protein ever crystallized was urease. This has nickel at its active site. Vitamin B, the cure for pernicious anemia, was shown by crystallography by Dorothy Hodgkin to have a cobalt atom in a corrin macrocycle. The Watson-Crick structure for DNA demonstrated the key structural role played by phosphate-containing polymers.

Her parents allowed Madea to party at this age. Around this time, Madea became a stripper and was given the name "Delicious". At 18, Madea was charged with illegal gambling, check fraud and identity theft. Around this time, Madea had at least two or three children. She supported herself and her children by pool dancing, stripping and professional wrestling. Madea graduated her high school in May 1959. That night, she had an affair with Thoedure Leroy Brown (also known as "Mr. Brown"). Madea became pregnant and had given birth to Cora Jean Simmons Brown. However, in the movie Madea's Big Happy Family, Mr. Brown had a DNA test which confirmed that he was not the father. Madea was diagnosed with type one diabetes and depression in her early 20s. She had became a bitter women around this time.
Madea's appearance is an elderly women who is not afraid to threaten anybody with her pistol. Madea usually helps her family through life situations, struggles and helping her family cope with one another. She teaches them wisdom; which helps them in their everyday life. Madea is also a forceful women who teaches young adults to act mature. Madea has been locked up in prison several times. She has outlived several of her husbands and lives off of their life security checks. Madea uses bad language and tone to speak to her family when they are disrespectful. She also has a bad temper and bad way of dealing with anger. Madea is known to be half African American and quarter-Cherokee Indian. She likes going to the casino on Sunday, rather than going to the church. Although Madea does not read the bible, she uses it to manipulate situations in order to justify what she had done.

Habituation

Habituation is a basic activity whereby an animal responds less to repeated stimuli. It is a primitive kind of learning.
The learning that underlies habituation is a basic process of biological systems. Animals do not need conscious motivation or awareness for it to occur. Habituation enables organisms to distinguish meaningful information from background stimuli.
Habituation occurs in all animals, as well as in the large protozoan "Stentor coeruleus". The decrease in responding is specific to the habituated stimulus. For example, if one was habituated to the taste of lemon, their responding would increase significantly when presented with the taste of lime. 
Two factors that can influence habituation include the time between each stimulus, and the length of time the stimulus is presented. Shorter intervals and longer durations increase habituation, and "vice versa".
Habituation need not be conscious. For example, a short time after a person dresses, the stimulus clothing creates disappears from our nervous systems and we become unaware of it. In this way, habituation is used to ignore any continual stimulus. This sort of habituation can occur through changes in sensory nerves themselves, and through negative feedback from the brain to peripheral sensory organs.

Nasal consonant

A nasal consonant is a type of consonant produced with a lowered velum in the mouth, allowing air to come out through the nose, while the air is not allowed to pass through the mouth because something (like the tongue or the lips) is stopping it. Examples of nasal consonants in English are and , in words such as "nose" and "mouth".
Nearly all nasal consonants are nasal stops (or nasal continuants), where air comes out through the nose but not through the mouth, as it is blocked by the lips or tongue. 
Most nasals are voiced, and, in fact, the nasal sounds and are among the most common sounds used in languages of the world. Voiceless nasals are used in a few languages, such as Burmese and Welsh. 
In terms of acoustics, nasal stops are sonorants, meaning that they do not significantly stop the flow of air (as it can come out the nose). However, nasals are also stops in their articulation because the flow of air through the mouth is blocked completely. So nasal consonants sound both like sonorants and like obstruents.
Acoustically, nasal stops have bands of energy at around 200 and 2,000 Hz.
Examples of languages containing nasal consonants:
The voiced retroflex nasal is [ɳ] is a common sound in Indic languages.
The voiced palatal nasal [ɲ] is a common sound in European languages, such as: Spanish "ñ"; or French and Italian "gn"; or Catalan, Hungarian and Luganda "ny"; or Czech and Slovak "ň"; or Polish "ń"; or Occitan and Portuguese "nh"; or Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian and Montenegrin "nj".
English, German and Cantonese have , and . Tamil possesses distinct letters to represent , , , , and (ம,ந,ன,ண,ஞ,ங).
Catalan, Occitan, Spanish, and Italian have , , as phonemes, and and as allophones. (In several American dialects of Spanish, there is no palatal nasal but only a palatalized nasal, , as in English "canyon". In Brazilian Portuguese nh is frequently pronounced as a nasalized [ j ], that is, as a nasal glide. This vowel also exists in Guaraní.)
The term 'nasal stop' will often be abbreviated to just "nasal". However, there are also nasal fricatives, nasal flaps, nasal glides, and nasal vowels, as in French, Portuguese, Catalan (dialectal feature), Yoruba, Gbe, Polish, and Ljubljana Slovene. In the , nasal vowels are indicated by placing a tilde (~) over the vowel. : French "sang" .
A select few languages use voiceless nasal consonants. Among them are Icelandic, Burmese, Jalapa Mazatec, Kildin Sami, Welsh, and Central Alaskan Yup'ik.

Term (mathematics)

A term is a mathematical expression which may form a separable part of an equation, a series, or another expression.
In elementary mathematics, a "term" is either a single number or variable, or the product of several numbers or variables. Terms are separated by a + or - sign in an overall expression. For example, in
3, 4"x", and 5"yzw" are three separate terms.
In the context of polynomials, "term" can mean a monomial with a coefficient. To 'collect like terms' in a polynomial is the basic operation of making it a linear combination of distinct monomials. For example,
A series is often represented as the sum of a sequence of terms. 
In general mathematical use, however, "term" is not limited to additive expressions.
Individual factors in an expression representing a product are multiplicative terms. Indeed, individual elements of any mathematical expression may be referred to as "terms".
Terms also appear in logic.

<doc id="307565" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307565" title="FG 42">
FG 42

The FG 42 (German: "Fallschirmjägergewehr" 42 or "paratrooper rifle 42") was a battle rifle. It was made in Nazi Germany during World War II. The weapon was made for use by Fallschirmjäger airborne infantry in 1942. It was used in small amounts until the war ended.
The FG 42 had the power of a light machine gun. It was light and was no larger than the Kar 98k bolt-action rifle. The FG 42 is thought to be one of the most advanced weapons of World War II. It helped shape the modern assault rifle idea.
At the time of the Battle of Crete (Operation Mercury), German "Fallschirmjäger" had the same weapons as the regular army. When they jumped from aircraft, they only had pistols and hand grenades. Submachine guns, rifles and other heavier weapons were dropped in crates. The design of the German parachutes meant that it was not safe to carry heavier weapons like rifles on jumps. At Crete, Commonwealth defenders killed or injured many German soldiers. This is because the German paratroopers had to go and collect their weapons from containers. These could be all over the battlefield. This showed that the weapons the regular army used were not good for air operations.
In 1941, the German Air Force ("Luftwaffe"), asked for a selective fire weapon for the paratroopers. Senior Staff Air Secretary Ossenbach at the "Luftwaffe" Weapons Development Branch (at Tarnewitz near Lübeck) was asked to develop this new weapon. The Reich Air Ministry ("Reichsluftfahrtministerium" or RLM) wanted to develop an automatic rifle which would be fired from the shoulder. It would replace the bolt-action rifle, submachine gun and light machine gun for air assault. The weapon would also make logistics simpler and give more firepower to a normal paratrooper.
The RLM tried to start a formal development program using the "Heereswaffenamt" (the HWaA, or Army Ordnance Department). The HWaA was in charge of German small arms development. However, the HWaA and the "Luftwaffe" had different priorities. Also, there were some disagreements between the "Luftwaffe" and the Army (the HWaA said no to the program because they thought it was not realistic. They tried to give their G 41(W) semi-automatic rifle instead). This meant that the "Luftwaffe" had to develop the weapon by itself. The engineers who would develop the weapon were skilled at developing light automatic weapons (they managed to change the MG 15 aircraft machine gun so that it could also be used on the ground). However, the paratroopers had many casualties during Operation Mercury. Because of this, Hitler decided that air assaults were not important, and the plans for the weapon were cancelled. However, Hermann Göring, head of the "Luftwaffe", secretly ordered the program to continue.
The RLM went straight to German companies with its plans. The first plan was the LC-6. It was given out on 14 December 1941. It said that the weapon should not be longer than , that it should not be longer than the Kar 98k rifle, fire single shots from a closed bolt, fire fully automatically from an open bolt, take its bullets from a 10 or 20-round magazine and be able to fire rifle grenades. Although the 7.9mm "Kurz" cartridge used by the "Heer" (the main army) (developed for the MP 43 assault rifle) was in service, the "Luftwaffe" decided to use the 7.92 x 57mm Mauser rifle round. This was because it had long range. This caliber was also mentioned in the plans for the design.
Six companies were asked to design prototypes. These were: Gustloff-Werke, Mauser, Johannes Großfuß Metall- und Lackierwarenfabrik, C.G. Hänel, Rheinmetall-Borsig and Heinrich Krieghoff Waffenfabrik. Several contracts were given out, but only a few prototypes are known to have been given. Mauser gave a version of the MG 81. However, it was turned down because it was too heavy and got its bullets from a belt. There was one design, made by Louis Stange at Rheinmetall-Borsig, that was accepted. It was tested at a test station at Tarnewitz in mid-1942. This prototype was called Gerät" 450 ("device 450") or Ausführung" "A" ("type A"). It was supposed to be a sheet metal design. The type "A" was never made (except for some models). However, the basic design was kept for more development.
The basic parts of the LC-6 were accepted. A group of changes to the design came afterwards. The improved version of the LC-6 was called the "Ausführung" "B". This improvement changed the hand guard so that it gave better protection against heat and a better grip when it was wet.
These tests showed many problems. They were fixed by Stange in April 1942. This other improved version was called the LC-6/II. The prototype was then given many tests. These tests were set up by the HWA. The prototype was changed even more, and finally it became the LC-6/III prototype. This became the FG 42.
50 rifles were made in early 1943. Six of these were sent away to be tested more. These weapons had some serious faults. One rifle failed after firing only 2,100 rounds. Also, a soldier was injured when he tried to fire a rifle grenade.
Several other changes were made to the FG 42 before it was allowed to be made. The first Rheinmetall design used chrome-nickel steel a lot. It was used on many parts which were needed to make the weapon work. There was not much of this material around. When the "Luftwaffe" was allowed to make 3,000 rifles for some more testing, the weapon was changed and manganese steel was used instead of chrome-nickel steel. The Heinrich Krieghoff company was asked to make some FG 42s. This was because Rheinmetall was not large enough to make lots of FG 42s. The weapon was first used by commandos during "Operation Eiche" in 1943. "Operation Eiche" was the dangerous mission that some "Fallschirmjäger" went on. During this mission, they had to rescue Benito Mussolini. The "Fallschirmjäger" team was led by Otto Skorzeny.
The weapon kept being changed. Because its first design was changed many times and the "Luftwaffe" needed different things, many different types of FG 42 were made. Papers and books written after World War II usually say that there were three main versions of FG 42. However, the Germans never said that they were different models. The "Model I", "Model II" and "Model III" were never officially mentioned. German papers just call the weapon the "FG 42". It was always the latest version of FG 42 that was mentioned.
The BD 42/I is a semi-automatic copy of the early FG 42 rifle. The BD 42/II is a semi-automatic copy of the later FG 42. Both of these were made by HZA Kulmbach GmbH.
The FG 42 was a selective fire weapon. It was cooled by the air. The FG 42 also had its magazine at the side. It was quite easy to control if it was being fired on fully automatic mode.
The FG 42 got its bullets from a box-shaped magazine. This magazine could hold 10 or 20 rounds.
The FG 42 was semi-automatic when it was being fired from a closed bolt. There was not very much movement when the weapon was being fired. This meant that firing single shots was more accurate. When the weapon was being fired in automatic mode, it was fired from an open bolt. When automatic mode was on, the bolt stayed open to keep the weapon cool.
The FG 42 was supposed to give some useful firepower to Nazi Germany. However, only a small amount were made. When it was tested, the paratroopers quite liked it. However, the FG 42 did have some issues. The FG 42 had a 20, or sometimes 10, round magazine which was put into the left side of the rifle. It was quite usual for submachine guns to have magazines on the side, but the bigger magazine with the heavier cartridges of a rifle quite unbalanced. Also, the end of the FG 42 rose into the air quite quickly when it was being fired in automatic mode. This made accurate automatic fire difficult. It also meant that automatic fire was not very useful. The U.S. M14 rifle had problems similar to these.
The American M41 Johnson LMG has many things that are similar to the FG 42. Both of these had their magazines on the left side. They also fired from an open bolt in automatic mode and closed bolt in semi-automatic mode. Although there are some things that are similar, there is no evidence that the designers of one weapon copied the design of another.
The last known weapons that were based on the FG 42 are the Sturmgewehr 52 and M60 machine gun.
After around 2,000 FG 42s were made by Krieghoff, the manganese steel that many important parts were made from were moved away to be used for other things. This meant that the weapon had to be redesigned to use stamped steel. Soldiers using the FG 42 asked for many small changes to be made to the design. These changes can be seen on later FG 42s. The FG 42 also had a simple bayonet under the barrel. It was hidden by the bipod. In the later version of the FG 42, the bayonet was shortened. Before the update, it was .

I've worked a lot on this article in the last few days. I simplified all the content, which came from enwiki, and referenced it extensively. The only issue I see, is the number of red links, but this can be fixed quickly. Any comments are welcome. 22:11, 16 August 2011 (UTC)
Extended for one week: Not really any consensus either way as yet, and to give time to fix the comments that came quite late in the day. 12:01, 6 September 2011 (UTC) 
Closed as not promoted: Your wish is my command - I was just thinking the same thing. Closed per Macdonald's comments and Barras' link. 15:48, 11 September 2011 (UTC) 
This article currently meets all the requirements for a GA. It is in simple English, fully referenced, comprehensive, and no red links. It is also about an important topic which is used in Australia's new National Curriculum. Please leave any concerns on the articles talk page. -- () 00:17, 7 September 2011 (UTC)

Extended for "two" weeks until 11 October 2011: Your wish is my command. Longer than usual extension to note that it had feedback arrive after the initial 'deadline' had passed - anything less would be unfair, as experience shows that the nominator does tend to address concerns that are raised promptly. 23:41, 28 September 2011 (UTC)

Nowhere near good enough I'm afraid - quick comments on the first few paragraphs.
It seems that you need help from a native English speaker. Your grammar isn't good enough I'm afraid for Simple English readers. Seriously, and I mean this, don't just fix these points and say "is there anything else?" because I haven't got the energy to read the rest of the article if it's as poor as the lead. Ask some good copyeditors to look at your work. Don't expect this nomination to last more than a few more days if you don't make massive corrections. () 18:15, 11 October 2011 (UTC)
What you must do is to ask a few people to copyedit the article for you. At its current level of quality, I am not prepared to give you comments on every single sentence, which is what has happened thus far. () 08:54, 13 October 2011 (UTC)
I personally agree with Goblin. The Rambling Man is a bureaucrat for a reason. He is one of the most helpful users on this wiki, and i'm sorry, but I won't stand for people saying otherwise. If you need a review, leave someone a message. It's pretty much what talk pages are for. Requesting help (which reviews fall into). Yes, you are correct that the rules don't state that articles "have" to be well written enough to be taken here, but again, it's something that common sense should tell you. Reviews aren't given "here". More often than not, you are informed that they have been reviewed here, but the review will (should) be on the article talk page. () 15:16, 13 October 2011 (UTC)
I'm pretty sure the article will fail because of word choices. I tried to keep the article as simple as possible by only adding basic information about the singer. However, even though its basic information, I did not leave any major aspects out of the article per WP:MoS.

Comments many issues. A sample from first para of the lead:
 () 12:33, 10 October 2011 (UTC)
I'm actually almost frightened that you might have "too many" sources. Do some of these statements really need to have 7-9 sources? The excess of numbers in superscript interferes a bit with the reading flow. Most of the issues in this article are on account of the English being slightly awkward in areas. Here are a few quick comments relating to that, although this isn't an exhaustive list in any way.
There are more problems, but I'm a bit short of time right now. I would suggest that you fix these and proofread the article a bit, because a few of these are quite obvious. Hope that helps. 01:29, 12 October 2011 (UTC)
As per above, you need to ask for someone to copyedit the whole article. I can find problems with just about every sentence in the article and I don't have time to (a) fix it all for you (b) comment on it all for you. It's just not ready. () 09:09, 13 October 2011 (UTC)

Suggestion : Since there seem to be a lot of issues/collaboration going on here, might I suggest closing this and moving this talk to the talk page? It makes more sense since this clearly needs a lot of work for GA status. () 19:22, 15 October 2011 (UTC)

Main outstanding concern was a few unreferenced statements; but now, with the exception of the lede and topic sentences, a reference for just about anything can be found within a few sentences.

Comment just a quick couple on a first glance, don't mix date formats in the references (all MDY or YYYY-MM-DD, but no mixture; compare refs 233, 234 and 235), be consistent, page numbers either have pp. or no pp., but not a mixture (compare ref 144 with ref 146) and ensure all online refs have codice_1. Much more to come I'm sure. () 13:59, 28 October 2011 (UTC)
Suggest closure since the nominator has been given a minimum one-month block from the Wikipedia. () 15:45, 31 October 2011 (UTC)
Comment: This has been nominated and closed several times. Issues that were raised at the previous nominations remain. In particular, not just the dates of references, but the relevance of some references remains an issue. I did a spot check of two online refs that had problems in previous noms and they have not been changed at all. I haven't re-checked all of them yet, but these are substantive problems, not just cosmetic ones. Agree with TRM's suggestion. () 21:29, 1 November 2011 (UTC)

The article is only a list of songs recorded by Selena herself. The only written content of the article is its lead. It is well sourced and I believe checking against the criteria would be very easy. Best, 21:18, 18 October 2011 (UTC)
Comment I haven't really looked at the subject list (but don't worry, I will...), but as long as it's referenced, well-written with decent prose, illustrated nicely, sortable (where applicable) and accessible, then I don't really have a problem with it being at PGA. But it "does" raise a question of precedence and it's probably worth a quick discussion and maybe a glance at en.wiki's featured list process for some guidance on whether we should crowbar lists into GA or develop a separate concept. () 06:52, 19 October 2011 (UTC)
Comment The question of whether lists should be GA or not may be a separate question. However, this article has several issues. It is almost entirely the work of one editor. It needs better formatting; there are no headings to organize the content. There are several grammatical errors (see "had became", "had wrote"). GAs usually have at least one image. I know that may difficult in this case because of copyright, but it is usual to have something visual. A sidebar or infobox outlining her career by album would probably be helpful too. Finally, for a list of songs, songwriter and producer information is probably needed to make it really complete. () 22:16, 31 October 2011 (UTC)

Closed as not promoted: This one has gone on for long enough now, I think: around 6 weeks or thereabouts, when the normal time is 3. Furthermore, there is no consensus to promote the article, nor is there any consensus nor criteria for having 'Good Lists'. All in all, stacks for a no-promote. 15:12, 5 December 2011 (UTC) 
This article is a simplified version of an En. good article that I expanded a bit with some extra sourcing. I've already had several grammar reviews of it. I have about 5 more redlinks to fulfill (3 in text and 2 in the infobox), and there are a few redlinks in the reference section as well (I don't know if those "count" so to speak). What else needs to be done to raise this to a GA? The lead looks skimpy, but I'm not sure what else can be included there. I think this only misses criteria 6 (redlinks) of the GA criteria in its current form. () 20:41, 31 October 2011 (UTC)

Are there any more concerns at this time? I have fixed all issues brought up here and at the talk page except for the date format on reference 7. I do not know how to fix that without changing the template or rewriting every single reference in the article to match the one there (I think it'd be really ridiculous to change the format of 20 references to match the style of 1). There are still some redlinks (West Virginia Division of Highways, Semi-trailer trucks, and Interstate 470 (Ohio–West Virginia) in the body; plus redlinks in the references).

Bioorganic chemistry

Bioorganic chemistry is a science that combines organic chemistry and biochemistry. Bioorganic chemistry expands organic chemistry towards biology. This differs from biochemistry, which studies biological processes using chemistry. When investigating enzymes and cofactors, bioorganic chemistry overlaps bioinorganic chemistry.
Biophysical organic chemistry is a term used when attempting to describe intimate details of molecular recognition by bioorganic chemistry. 
Bioorganic chemistry is that branch of life science, which deals with the study of biological processes using chemical methods.

<doc id="307599" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307599" title="Carbocation">
Carbocation

A carbocation () is an ion with a positively-charged carbon atom. The charged carbon atom in a carbocation is a "sextet" (that is, it has only six electrons in its outer valence shell instead of eight valence electrons.) Carbon atoms with eight valence elections have the maximum stability (octet rule). Therefore, carbocations are often reactive, seeking to fill the octet of valence electrons as well as regain a neutral charge. Logic would say that carbocation have sp hybridization with an empty sp orbital giving positive charge. However, the reactivity of a carbocation more closely resembles sp hybridization with a trigonal planar molecular geometry.
A carbocation was previously often called a "carbonium ion" but chemists questions the exact meaning. In present-day chemistry, a carbocation is any positively charged carbon atom. Two special types have been suggested: carbenium ions are trivalent and carbonium ions are pentavalent or hexavalent. University level textbooks only discuss carbocations as if they are carbenium ions, or discuss carbocations with a fleeting reference to the older phrase of carbonium ion or carbenium and carbonium ions. One textbook to this day stays with the older name of carbonium ion for carbenium ion and reserves the phrase "hypervalent carbenium ion" for CH.
In 1891, G. Merling reported that he added bromine to tropylidene (cycloheptatriene) and then heated the product to obtain a crystalline, water soluble material, . He did not suggest a structure for it; however Doering and Knox convincingly showed that it was tropylium (cycloheptatrienylium) bromide. This ion is predicted to be aromatic by the Hückel Rule.
In 1902, Norris and Kehrman independently discovered that colorless triphenylmethanol gave deep yellow solutions in concentrated sulfuric acid. Triphenylmethyl chloride similarly formed orange complexes with aluminium and tin chlorides. In 1902, Adolf von Baeyer recognized the salt-like character of the compounds formed.
He called the relationship between color and salt formation halochromy of which malachite green is a prime example.
Carbocations are reactive intermediates in many organic reactions. This idea, first proposed by Julius Stieglitz in 1899 was further developed by Hans Meerwein in his 1922 study of the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. Carbocations were also found to be involved in the S1 reaction, the E1 reaction, and in rearrangement reactions such as the Whitmore 1,2 shift. The chemical establishment was reluctant to accept the notion of a carbocation and for a long time the "Journal of the American Chemical Society" refused articles that mentioned them.
The first NMR spectrum of a stable carbocation in solution was published by Doering et al. in 1958. It was the heptamethylbenzenonium ion, made by treating hexamethylbenzene with methyl chloride and aluminium chloride. The stable 7-norbornadienyl cation was prepared by Story et al. in 1960 by reacting norbornadienyl chloride with silver tetrafluoroborate in sulfur dioxide at −80 °C. The NMR spectrum established that it was non-classically bridged (the first stable non-classical ion observed).
In 1962, Olah directly observed the tert-butyl carbocation by nuclear magnetic resonance as a stable species on dissolving tert-butyl fluoride in magic acid. The NMR of the norbornyl cation was first reported by Schleyer et al. and it was shown to undergo proton-scrambling over a barrier by Saunders et al.
In organic chemistry, a carbocation is often the target of nucleophilic attack by nucleophiles like hydroxyl (OH) ions or halogen ions.
Carbocations are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary depending on the number of carbon atoms bonded to the ionized carbon. Primary carbocations have one or zero carbons attached to the ionized carbon, secondary carbocations have two carbons attached to the ionized carbon, and tertiary carbocations have three carbons attached to the ionized carbon.
Stability of the carbocation increases with the number of alkyl groups bonded to the charge-bearing carbon. Tertiary carbocations are more stable (and form more readily) than secondary carbocations; primary carbocations are highly unstable because, while ionized higher-order carbons are stabilized by hyperconjugation, unsubstituted (primary) carbons are not. Therefore, reactions such as the S1 reaction and the E1 elimination reaction normally do not occur if a primary carbocation would be formed. An exception to this occurs when there is a carbon-carbon double bond next to the ionized carbon. Such cations as "allyl" cation CH=CH–CH and "benzyl" cation CH–CH are more stable than most other carbocations. Molecules which can form allyl or benzyl carbocations are especially reactive.
Carbocations undergo rearrangement reactions from less stable structures to equally stable or more stable ones with rate constants in excess of 10/sec. This fact complicates synthetic pathways to many compounds. For example, when 3-pentanol is heated with aqueous HCl, the initially formed 3-pentyl carbocation rearranges to a statistical mixture of the 3-pentyl and 2-pentyl. These cations react with chloride ion to produce about 1/3 3-chloropentane and 2/3 2-chloropentane.
Some carbocations such as the norbornyl cation exhibit more or less symmetrical three centre bonding. Cations of this sort have been referred to as non-classical ions. The energy difference between "classical" carbocations and "non-classical" isomers is often very small, and there is generally little, if any activation energy involved in the transition between "classical" and "non-classical" structures. The "non-classical" form of the 2-butyl carbocation is essentially 2-butene with a proton directly above the centre of what would be the carbon-carbon double bond. "Non-classical" carbocations were once the subject of great controversy. One of George Olah's greatest contributions to chemistry was resolving this controversy.
Cyclopropylcarbinyl cations can be studied by NMR:
In the NMR spectrum of a dimethyl derivative, two nonequivalent signals are found for the two methyl groups indicating that the molecular conformation of this cation not perpendicular (as in A) but is bisected (as in B) with the empty p-orbital and the cyclopropyl ring system in the same plane:
In terms of bent bond theory, this preference is explained by assuming favorable orbital overlap between the filled cyclopropane bent bonds and the empty p-orbital.

Isodesmic reaction

An isodesmic reaction is a chemical reaction where the type of chemical bonds broken in the reactant are the same as the type of bonds formed in the reaction product. This type of reaction is often used as a hypothetical reaction in thermochemistry.
An example of an isodesmic reaction is 
Equation 1 describes the deprotonation of a methyl halide by a methyl anion. The energy change associated with this exothermic reaction can be calculated using a computer. The energy change increases going from fluorine to chlorine to bromine and iodine. This shows that the CHI anion is the most stable and least basic of all the halides. Each of these reactions are isodesmic. The energy change in each example also depends on the difference in bond energy of the C-X bond in the base and conjugate acid. In other cases, the difference may be due to steric strain (the blocking of atoms by other atoms). The steric strain is small in fluorine (which is a small diameter atom) but large in iodine (in favor of the anion). So, the energy change grows between each example halide despite the fact that C-F bonds are stronger than C-I bonds.
The related term homodesmotic reaction also takes into account orbital hybridization. Homodesmotic reactions also have the same number of carbon to hydrogen (C-H) bonds. An example of a homodesmotic reaction is:

Spit

A spit is a depositional landform found off coasts. Spits connect to the beach, and extend into the sea. A spit forms because the sand on the beach is moved by the waves along the shore, and the sand collects at the end to form a spit. The process of the waves moving the sand along the shore is known as longshore drift.

Sawfish

The Sawfish are a family of rays which have a long body, like a shark. One feature that separates a sawfish from other rays is its long, saw-like snout. On either side of this "rostrum" are little teeth like a saw. 
Sawfish have a mouth, nostrils, and gill slits under their body, just like a ray. Also, their pectoral fins are enlarged, like those of a ray. Also like rays, when they settle on the bottom, they take in water through two spiracles just behing the eyes. This gets water for the gills, without sand.
Several species can grow to about .
The sawfish's most distinctive feature is the saw-like rostrum. The rostrum is covered with motion- and electro-sensitive pores. These allow sawfish to detect movement and even heartbeats of prey hiding under the ocean floor. The rostrum serves as a digging tool to unearth buried crustaceans. 
If a suitable prey swims by, the normally lethargic sawfish springs from the bottom and slashes at it with its saw. This generally stuns or injures the prey sufficiently for the sawfish to devour it. Sawfish also defend themselves with their rostrum, against predators such as sharks and intruding divers. The 'teeth' protruding from the rostrum are not real teeth, but modified tooth-like structures called "denticles".

Eagle ray

Eagle rays are cartilaginous fish in the ray family Myliobatidae. They are mostly large species living in the open ocean rather than on the sea bottom.
Eagle rays feed on molluscs and crustaceans, crushing their shells with their flattened teeth, while devil rays and manta rays filter plankton from the water. 
They are excellent swimmers and are able to breach the water up to several metres above the surface. Compared with other rays, they have long tails, and well-defined diamond-shaped bodies. They are ovoviviparous, giving birth to up to six young at a time. They range from to in length.
The tail looks like a whip and may be as long as the body. It is armed with a sting. Eagle rays live close to the coast in depths of 1 to 30 metres and in exceptional cases they are found as deep as 300 m. The eagle ray is commonly seen cruising along sandy beaches in very shallow waters.
In Nelson's "Fishes of the World", the eagle rays are a subfamily, and are joined by the manta rays and the eagle rays. As Nelson sees it, there are seven genera in the family, in three subfamilies. In our classification, the three groups are families in the suborder Myliobatoidei.

Glasgow Prestwick Airport

Glasgow Prestwick Airport is the second airport serving Glasgow. It also serves the Greater Glasgow area. It is northeast of the town of Prestwick in South Ayrshire. It is 32 miles from the city centre of Glasgow.
Prestwick is Scotland's largest airport by size. However, Edinburgh Airport, Glasgow International and Aberdeen Airport all handle more passengers. The year with the most passengers passing through Prestwick was 2007. Since 2007, a lot less passengers pass through Prestwick. 1.3 million passengers passed through the airport in 2011. This was 22% reduction from 2010.
Douglas Fowler McIntyre and the Duke of Hamilton owned the airport at first. These people were the first to fly a plane to the top of Mount Everest in 1933. During and after World War II it was a Royal Air Force base. In 1952 it was made a United States Air Force base.
The airport was made bigger in the early 1960s: the runway was made longer and a new terminal building was made. The new, bigger airport opened in 1964. Today, Glasgow Prestwick is mostly used by Ryanair.
On 8 March 2012, Infratil, the company which owns Prestwick, said that they had placed the airport up for sale. The Chief Executive Marco Bogoievski said that he does not regret selling the airport.
The Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm uses part of the airport. It has 3 Sea King helicopters there for search and rescue. They cover Ben Nevis, the Lakes, Northern Ireland and 200 NM (370 km; 230 mi) past the Irish coast. This force is often called 'HMS Gannet'. 15 officers, 11 ratings, 28 civil servants and 50 civilian staff work at the base.

Iodine deficiency

Iodine deficiency is when there is not enough iodine in the body. Iodine is an essential trace element. The thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodotyronine have iodine. In areas where marine food is not eaten, there is low iodine in the diet. This causes iodine deficiency which gives rise to
goiter (so-called endemic goiter), as well as cretinism, which results in developmental delays and other health problems.
"The Lancet" has said, "According to WHO, in 2007, nearly 2 billion individuals had insufficient iodine intake, a third being of school age. ... Thus iodine deficiency, as the single greatest preventable cause of mental retardation, is an important public-health problem." Iodine deficiency causes diseases of the oral and salivary glands.
In these areas,small amounts of iodine to table salt in form of sodium iodide, potassium iodide, and/or potassium iodate is added. This helps preventing iodine deficiency. This product is known as "iodized salt". Iodine compounds have also been added to other foods. This includes flour, water and milk in areas of deficiency. Seafood is also a well known source of iodine. Thus, iodine deficiency is more common in mountainous regions of the world where food is grown in soil poor in iodine.

Trachea

The trachea, or windpipe, is the bony tube that connects the nose and mouth to the lungs, and is an important part of the vertebrate respiratory system. The trachea begins at the lower part of the larynx and continues to the lungs, where it branches into the right and left bronchi. Inflammation of the trachea can lead to other conditions, such as tracheitis, which is the inflammation of the linings of the trachea.
The invertebrate trachea refers to the open respiratory system of terrestrial arthropods. It consists of spiracles, tracheae, and tracheoles that take metabolic gases to and from tissues. The distribution of spiracles varies, but in general each segment of the body has only one pair of spiracles, each of which connects to an atrium and has a relatively large tracheal tube behind it. 
The smallest tubes, tracheoles, penetrate cells and diffuse water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. Gas may be moved actively or by passive diffusion. Unlike vertebrates, insects do not generally carry oxygen in their haemolymph.
This is one of the factors that may limit their size.
A tracheal tube may contain ridge-like circumferential rings of taenidia in various geometries such as loops or helices. In the head, thorax, or abdomen, tracheae may also be connected to air sacs. Many insects, such as grasshoppers and bees, which actively pump the air sacs in their abdomen, are able to control the flow of air through their body. In some aquatic insects, the tracheae exchange gas through the body wall directly, in the form of a gill, or function as normal, via a plastron. Despite being internal, the tracheae of arthropods are shed during moulting (ecdysis).

Peter John Smith (born February 27, 1966 in Abington, Massachusetts) is a former Major League Baseball starting pitcher. He was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1st round (21st overall pick) in the amateur draft of 1984. Smith was signed on June 14, 1984 to play Minor League Baseball in the Philadelphia Phillies organization. He batted and threw right-handed during his baseball career.
The Philadelphia Phillies traded Smith to the Atlanta Braves, along with Ozzie Virgil, Jr., for Steve Bedrosian and Milt Thompson. Smith made his major league debut on September 8, 1987 with the Atlanta Braves at age 21. In 1988, Smith pitched 3 shutouts, the season after his rookie year. The Atlanta Braves hoped Smith would turn into an ace pitcher as John Smoltz and Tom Glavine were becoming. But in 1989, Smith's earned run average (ERA) was at 4.75 at the end of the season, higher than his ERA in 1988 when it was at 3.69. He played the 1987-1993 seasons with the Atlanta Braves before being traded to the New York Mets for Dave Gallagher. With the New York Mets, Smith only played the 1994 season before being granted free agency on October 25 of that year. On December 1, 1994, Smith was signed as a free agent with the Cincinnati Reds. He played with the Cincinnati Reds for only half of the 1995 season before being traded to the Florida Marlins on July 1, 1995 as a free agent. On December 23, 1995, Smith signed as a free agent with the San Diego Padres playing one season with them.
On June 9, 1998, Smith was traded to the Baltimore Orioles organization for minor leaguer, Eric Estes. He played his final game on September 24, 1998. He earned a career ERA of 4.55, striking out 640 batters. Smith also pitched 4 shutouts throughout his major league career.

Electric ray

The electric rays are a group of rays, flattened cartilaginous fish with enlarged pectoral fins. They are the order Torpediniformes. 
They can produce an electric discharge, ranging from as little as 8 volts up to 220 volts depending on species. There are 69 species in four subfamilies.
These rays have battery-like electric organs on both sides of their heads, which can make a powerful electric shock. They use this shock to stun their prey and for their own self defense.
Electric rays are found from shallow coastal waters down to at least depth. They are sluggish and slow moving, propelling themselves along with their tails, rather than using their disc-shaped bodies, as other rays do. They feed on invertebrates and small fish. They lie in wait for prey below the sand or other substrate, using their electricity to stun and capture it.
The electric rays are regarded as monophyletic, though in detail the group has been classified in several ways. This is one way the order can be classified.
The word torpedo comes from a genus of electric rays in the sub-family Torpedininae, namely "Torpedo", which in turn comes from the Latin "torpere" (to be stiff or numb).

While selling all types of doughnuts, Krispy Kreme's signature is a glazed doughnut that is traditionally served warm.
Loblaws supermarkets and Petro-Canada gas stations in Canada have Krispy Kreme. In the United Kingdom Tesco supermarkets, Tesco Extra and Moto service stations carry Krispy Kreme products.
On May 6, 2008, the first Krispy Kreme shop in Puerto Rico opened, followed by two additional places in 2010 and one location in 2011.
In 2002, Krispy Kreme opened a restaurant-style shop in the Amarillo area in Texas.
The 18 stores that opened in Canada were reduced to four. Two of them are in Quebec while the other two stores are in Mississauga, Ontario and Delta, British Columbia. A small seasonal shop was recently opened in Wasaga Beach, Ontario. The Wasaga Beach receives its doughnuts from the Mississauga shop every morning. Another small store recently opened on November 3, 2010 in Toronto at Bathurst and Harbord Streets in the city's Harbord Village neighborhood. This store got shipments from the Mississauga store. Krispy Kreme's Canadian assets were put up for sale in 2005 seven weeks after the U.S.-based doughnut company had the firm that owns the stores in Canada placed under bankruptcy protection.
In Japan, over 27 shops of Krispy Kreme doughnuts opened around the country.

Demersal

Demersal animals live on or near the bottom of the sea or lakes. The term is usually applied to fish. 
They occupy the sea floors and lake beds, which usually consist of mud, sand, gravel or rocks. In coastal waters they are found on or near the continental shelf, and in deep waters they are found on or near the continental slope or along the continental rise. They are not generally found in the deepest waters, such as abyssal depths or on the abyssal plain, but they can be found around seamounts and islands. The word "demersal" comes from the Latin "demergere", which means "to sink".
Demersal fish are bottom feeders. They can be contrasted with pelagic fish which live and feed away from the bottom in the open water column. Demersal fish fillets contain little fish oil (one to four percent), whereas pelagic fish can contain up to 30 percent.

Contigo Quiero Estar

"Contigo Quiero Estar" () is a song by American singer Selena. It was released as the lead single from "Selena" (1989). The single was released by EMI Latin on May 27, 1989. The song "Quiero Ser" (English: "I Want To Be") is the b-side track. The song's lyrics are about a women who wants to be near her lover. It was written by Mexican songwriter Alejandro Montealegre. "Contigo Quiero Estar" is a Tejano song mixed with folk and ranchera music.
The song did not get good reviews from music critics. "Contigo Quiero Estar" was nominated for Single of the Year at the 1990 Tejano Music Awards. Selena performed "Where Did the Feeling Go?", which was a demo she recorded. Many critics liked the song more than "Contigo Quiero Estar". "Contigo Quiero Estar" reached number eight on the US "Billboard" Hot Latin Songs chart in 1989. Many other artists have made cover versions of the song.
In 1989, Selena signed a recording contract with EMI Latin. That same year, she began recording songs for her debut album with them. Selena's record producer—brother A.B. Quintanilla III—was not allowed to produce any songs for her new album. Quintanilla III was interviewed for the "Selena: 20 Years of Music" series. This was recorded by Brian "Red" Moore, a family friend. Quintanilla III told Moore that EMI Latin did not want the family to be involved. He then said that they were already gambling on releasing a Latin division. Quintanilla III said that EMI Latin believed that the family could hurt the sales of the album. 
Selena's father and manager, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. tried to persuade EMI Latin to give Quintanilla III a chance. Quintanilla Jr succeeded and Quintanilla III was allowed to produce the album, including the song "Contigo Quiero Estar". Mexican songwriter Alejandro Montealegre, sent in lyrics to EMI Latin. They then wanted Selena to record it. They believed it was similar with her other recorded songs.
The song is a mid-tempo Tejano song. It is mixed with folk and ranchera music. The song's instruments includes the drums, an electric keyboard, a french horn and the piano. The song's lyrics are about a women who wants to be next to her lover all the time. "Contigo Quiero Estar" was released as the lead single from "Selena" (1989). The b-side track included the song "Quiero Ser". They were released on May 27, 1989 by EMI Latin. 
The song did not get good reviews from music critics. A writer for "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution" believed "Contigo Quiero Estar" is one of the worst songs Selena ever recorded. Sally Jacobs of "The Boston Globe" wrote that Selena made a "mistake with this song." Carmina Danini of the "San Antonio Express-News" liked the Tejano sounds on "Contigo Quiero Estar". Dave Hoekstra of the "Chicago Sun-Times" called "Contigo Quiero Estar" a "weak ranchera song". A writer for the "Austin American-Statesman" gave the song a score of 2 out of a possible 5 star rating.
"Contigo Quiero Estar" was nominated for Single of the Year at the 1990 Tejano Music Awards. Selena performed "Where Did the Feeling Go?" rather than "Contigo Quiero Estar", which was a demo she recorded. Many critics liked "Where Did the Feeling Go?". They believed it was a better choice for a single. Ben Tavera King of the "San Antonio-Express News" liked "Where Did the Feeling Go?" more than "Contigo Quiero Estar".
The song reached number eight on the US "Billboard" Hot Latin Songs chart in 1989. Mexican band Los Reyes de Mexico recorded a mariachi version of the song. It was included on their album "Reyes De Mexico Lo Lindo Ti". Puerto Rican band Orquesta Armonia Show recorded both a merengue and a cumbia version. It was included on their album "Merengues y Cumbias".
Credits were taken from the single's booklet.

Alice Stokes Paul (January 11, 1885 – July 9, 1977) was an American suffragist and activist. Along with Lucy Burns and others, she led a successful campaign for women's suffrage. Her work resulted in the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920. 
Paul was the original author of a proposed Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the Constitution in 1923. The ERA would not get to the Senate for a vote until 1972. That year, it was approved by the Senate and submitted to the state legislatures for ratification. Approval by 38 states was required to ratify the amendment. Not enough states — only 35 — voted in favor before the deadline. However, people still work to have the states pass the ERA passed by Congress in the 1970s. Other people are working to add a new equality amendment to the US Constitution. Also, almost half of the U.S. states have adopted the ERA into their state constitutions.

Feathered dinosaur

A feathered dinosaur is a dinosaur with feathers. It is now thought that all coelurosaurs, and perhaps all theropods, had feathers. 
The possibility that dinosaurs are closely related to birds raised the possibility of feathers. Fossils of "Archaeopteryx" include well-preserved feathers, but it was not until the early 1990s that clearly non-bird dinosaur fossils were discovered with preserved feathers. About 40 genera of theropods are now known to be feathered. 
Most of these fossils come from the Yixian formation in China. The fossil feathers of one specimen, "Shuvuuia deserti", have been tested positive for beta-keratin in immunological tests. This is the main protein in bird feathers.
After a century without clear evidence, well-preserved fossils of feathered dinosaurs were discovered during the 1990s, and more continue to be found. The fossils were preserved in a Lagerstätte — a sedimentary deposit exhibiting remarkable richness and completeness in its fossils — in Liaoning, China. 
The area had repeatedly been smothered in volcanic ash by eruptions in Inner Mongolia 124 million years ago, during the Lower Cretaceous. The fine-grained ash preserved the living organisms that it buried in fine detail. The area was teeming with life, with millions of leaves, angiosperms (the oldest known), insects, fish, frogs, salamanders, mammals, turtles, lizards and crocodilians discovered to date.
The most important discoveries at Liaoning have been a host of feathered dinosaur fossils, with a steady stream of new finds filling in the picture of the dinosaur-bird connection and adding more to theories of the evolutionary development of feathers and flight. Quill knobs were found an ulna of "Velociraptor mongoliensis". These are associated with large, well-developed secondary feathers.
Behavioural evidence, in the form of an oviraptorosaur on its nest, showed another link with birds. Its forearms were folded, like those of a bird. Although no feathers were preserved, it is likely that these would have been present to keep eggs and juveniles warm.
The feathered tail of a non-avialan (non-bird) theropod has been found preserved in mid-Cretaceous (∼99 mya) amber from Kachin State, Myanmar (Burma). The BBC describe it as "perfectly preserved". Lida Xing found it at an amber market in Myitkina, Myanmar. The amber was already polished for jewellery: the seller thought it was plant material. However, it was the tail of a feathered dinosaur about the size of a sparrow. The feathers were not flight feathers. Dr Paul Barrett, from London's Natural History Museum, called the specimen a "beautiful fossil", describing it as a "really rare occurrence of vertebrate material in amber".
In 2011, samples of amber were discovered to contain preserved feathers from the Cretaceous period, with evidence that they were from both dinosaurs and birds. Initial analysis suggests that some of the feathers were used for insulation, and not flight.
A number of non-avialan dinosaurs are now known to have been feathered. Direct evidence of feathers exists for the following genera, listed in the order currently accepted evidence was first published. 
The evidence consists of feather impressions, or convincing skeletal or chemical evidence. Skeletal evidence would be the presence of quill knobs (the anchor points for wing feathers on the forelimb) or a pygostyle (the fused vertebrae at the tail tip which often supports large feathers).
For comparison: "Archaeopteryx" (1861; avialan) definitely had working flight feathers with off-centre rachis (stem). Otherwise, apart from the front limbs, it was a typical small carnivorous dinosaur.

Monoculture

Monoculture is growing a single crop in a large area. This is very common in modern agriculture, as it allows relatively few people to harvest large amounts. Monocultures have problems, however: It is easier for pests and diseases to spread in a monocultrure than when crop rotation is used. Growing the same crop also puts a strain on the soil, which may need to be fertilized to support a monoculture. Farmers who don't understand these problems may ruin their farm.

<doc id="307854" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307854" title="Rahonavis">
Rahonavis

Rahonavis is a genus of bird-like feathered dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous, 70–65 million years ago (mya) of what is now northwestern Madagascar. 
It is known from a partial skeleton found in a quarry. "Rahonavis" was a small predator, at about long, with the typical "Velociraptor"-like raised sickle claw on the second toe.
"Rahonavis" has quill knobs on its ulna (forearm bone), which led at first to its inclusion among the birds. However, the rest of the skeleton is rather typically dromaeosaurid. 
Makovicky and colleagues consider "Rahonavis" to be closely related to the South American dromaeosaurids "Unenlagia" and "Buitreraptor", and thus a member of the subfamily Unenlagiinae. Norell and colleagues (2006) also found "Rahonavis" to lie within the Unenlagiinae, as the sister taxon to "Unenlagia" itself. A 2007 study by Turner and colleagues again found it to be closely related to "Unenlagia".
"Rahonavis" was one-fifth larger than the closely related "Archaeopteryx", about the size of a modern raven.
Although numerous artists' reconstructions of "Rahonavis" show it in flight, it is not clear that it could fly. There is even been some doubt that the forearm material, which includes the quill knobs, belongs with the rest of the skeleton. Some researchers have suggested that "Rahonavis" represents a chimaera, with the forelimb of a bird mixed with the skeleton of a dromaeosaurid. 
The nearby discovery of the primitive bird "Vorona berivotrensis" shows that the possibility of a mix-up cannot be entirely excluded. However, many other scientists, including the original describers of "Rahonavis", think its remains belong to a single animal. The wing bones are close to the rest of the skeleton. All the bones attributed to "Rahonavis" were buried in an area "smaller than a letter-sized page", according to co-describer Luis M. Chiappe in his 2007 book "Glorified Dinosaurs". Chiappe maintained that "Rahonavis" could probably fly, noting that its ulna was large and robust compared to "Archaeopteryx", and that this fact, coupled with the prominent quill knobs, suggest that "Rahonavis" had larger and more powerful wings than that earlier bird. In addition, "Rahonavis" shoulder bones show evidence of ligament attachments allowing the independent mobility needed for flapping flight. Chiappe concluded that "Rahonavis" was capable of flight, though it would have been more "clumsy in the air than modern birds".

It takes elements from the "Mario Party" series, which is another video game series that is made by Nintendo. It has over 80 minigames, like Spin-Off, and House Party.
Board Game Island
In the beginning the players play a minigame to set an order. The winner gets a normal dice plus a gold dice,the second placed 
gets a silver dice, the 3rd place is playing with the bronze dice and the last one does not get anything. He has to play with only one normal dice. The gold dice has the numbers 1 - 6,the silver dice has the numbers 1 - 3,the bronze dice has the numbers 1 - 2 while the normal dice the normal 1 - 6. After the minigame the winner starts first. Then it is the turn of the second place. Place 3 plays as third one and the loser as last one. The object of the game is to reach the mountaintop as first. On the way to the goal there are many happening spaces which makes it harder or easier to win. After each player rolled the dices a minigame appears. 
Globe Trot
The players go on a journey around the world. But in contrast to the other game the player has to take card to move. He can go 
1,2 or 3 spaces. Each player gets 10 coins in the beginning, an Easter egg from the Mario Party series.The object is to reach special points on the globe (as example: Buy a fan in Japan or eat a Hamburger in the USA.)The visiting of a point costs 10 coins. With any visiting the player collects photos. The player who has the most at the end wins. 
Bingo
A game that makes always fun while playing. As a parody to the famous gambling Bingo. Each player chooses a card with Mii's faces on it. Then the game begins. A huge bingo machine drops balls in every round. The balls show Mii's faces. If a player has 3 faces in a row a voice calls 'Bingo!' and the player wins. So called Minigame balls make the players play a minigame. The winner can choose which face we wants to choose.
Mii of a kind
The players swap their Miis against Miis in the middle. The player who has two rows with 3 same Miis in it wins. It is a parody of the card game Thirty-one. 
Spin Off
Players spin a wheel and get money. The player who has the surpreme amount of money wins.

Its formation was based on the basis of Islamic nationalism. However, due to rampant corruption within the ranks of the government and bureaucracy, economic inequality between the country's two wings caused mainly by a lack of representative government and the government's indifference to the efforts of fierce ethno-nationalistic politicians like Mujeeb-ur-Rehman, colonial East Bengal (Eastern Pakistan) Civil war of and Partition of Pakistan the Bhola cyclone and the 1970 elections were the major factors, resulting in the formation of a new linguistic state of the People's Republic of Bangladesh.

Pallas () was a Titan from Greek mythology. He was associated with war, killed by Athena in the contest to fight for Zeus. Most sources say he was the son of Crius and Eurybia, the brother of Astraeus and Perses, and the husband of Styx. He was the father of Zelus, Nike, Kratos, and Bia. In addition, he has been named as the father of Scylla, Fontes, and Lacus. Some say he was the son of Megamedes and father of Selene, and is also recorded as the father of Eos.
The city Pellene, in Achaea, was named after Pallas, as was the asteroid 2 Pallas.

Childhood obesity consists of excess body fat that adversely affects children's health and well being. Obesity for children is "especially" dangerous because many overweight children will become overweight adults. Health problems related to overweight kids include but are not limited to Type 2 diabetes in adolescence and young adulthood, heart disease, stroke and high blood pressure, diseases which until recently were not common in children and teenagers.

Fricative consonant

A fricative consonant is a consonant that is made when you squeeze air through a small hole or gap in your mouth. For example, the gaps between your teeth can make fricative consonants; when these gaps are used, the fricatives are called sibilants. An example of a sibilant in English is , , , and . 
This is a list of sibilant fricatives. 
In many languages, such as English, the glottal "fricatives" like the in English "hat", ia not really a fricative because there are just vowels that are not voiced. However, in languages such as Arabic, they are true fricatives.

Central limit theorem

The central limit theorems are theorems for probability theory. They say that given a large number of independent random variables, their sum will follow a stable distribution. If the variance of the random variables is finite, a Gaussian distribution will result. This is one of the reasons why this distribution is also known as "normal" distribution. 
The best known and most important of these is known as "the central limit theorem". It is about large numbers of random variables with the same distribution, and with a finite variance and expected value. 
There are different generalisations of this theorem. Some of these generalisations no longer require an identical distribution of all random variables. In these generalisations, another precondition makes sure that no single random variable has a bigger influence on the outcome than the others. Examples are the Lindeberg and Lyapunov conditions. 
The name of the theorem is based on a paper George Pólya wrote in 1920, "About the Central Limit Theorem in Probability Theory and the Moment problem".

MG 42

The MG 42 (shortened from German: "Maschinengewehr 42", or "machine gun 42") was a general-purpose machine gun. It was developed in Nazi Germany. It began being used by the "Wehrmacht" in 1942. It was used with (and sometimes replaced) the MG 34 general-purpose machine gun in the German Armed Forces. However, both weapons were made and used until the end of the war.
The MG 42 was known for being reliable, simple and easy to use. However, it is best known for its very high rate of fire. There were other automatic weapon designs with similar firepower. Some examples of these are the French Darne, the Hungarian-Gebauer, the Russian 7.62mm ShKAS and the British Vickers K machine gun. However, because the MG 42 got its ammunition from a belt and its barrel was easy to change, it could fire for longer than these weapons.
The MG 42 was used to design new weapons after Nazi Germany surrendered. The MG1 (MG 42/59) was nearly exactly the same as the MG 42. The MG1 became the MG1A3, which in turn became the MG 3. The Swiss MG 51, SIG MG 710-3, Austrian MG 74, and the Spanish 5.56mm Ameli light machine gun were all designed from the MG 42. The M60 and Belgian MAG also copied some features. The MG 42 was still used by many armed groups after the war.
During the 1930s, the German Army began using the MG 34. The MG 34 was thought to be the first general-purpose machine gun. The MG 34 had a barrel that could be changed quickly. It was also able to fire from big magazines or a belt. This meant that the MG 34 could fire for much longer than weapons like the Browning Automatic Rifle, Japanese Type 11, British Bren and French Châtellerault LMG. It was also much lighter than weapons like the Vickers machine gun and M1917 Browning machine gun. The MG 34 was also very changeable. It was able to fire from a belt and a drum magazine. It could also be fired from tripods or from armoured vehicles. It even became one of the main defensive guns for the "Luftwaffe" as the MG 81. It was also used as a second gun on tanks as the MG 34 Panzerlauf. However, the MG 34 did have some problems. An example of this is that the MG 34 broke easily if it was exposed to dust. It was also quite expensive to make. The MG 34S was made as an improvement to the design. 
So that these problems could be fixed, a contest was started to find a replacement for the MG 34. Three companies were asked to design this replacement. These were: Metall und Lackierwarenfabrik Johannes Großfuß AG, Rheinmetall-Borsig, and Stübgen. Großfuß AG's design turned out to be the best. Strangely, Großfuß did not make weapons. They mostly made metal lanterns. Ernst Grunow was one of the head design engineers with Großfuß. He did not know anything about machine guns when he was told he would be involved in the project. However, he knew a lot about the machines used to make a lot of a product (mass production). Grunow went to an army machine gunner's training course to help him understand machine guns more. He also asked some soldiers for information. He then used some ideas used by Mauser and added some features he learned about from talking to army machine gunners and things that happened early on in World War II. The new design was much easier to build. It took 75 hours to make the new gun. However, the MG 34 took 150 hours. The new gun cost 250 RM. However, the MG 34 cost 327 RM. The MG 42 was made out of stamped metal. This made it easier to make than other machine guns.
This gun ended up being called the MG 39. It was similar to the MG 34 overall. To the gunner, the only large change was that it could not fire from drum magazines anymore. This meant that the weapon had to fire from a belt or from a drum-shaped magazine that attached to the side of the gun and had a belt inside it. 
The weapon was officially brought into service. The weapon began being made in 1942 as the MG 42. Großfuß, Mauser-Werke, Gustloff-Werke and some others were given contracts to make the MG 42.
The MG 42 had a very high rate of fire. It could fire about 1,200 rounds per minute. This was twice the rate of the British Vickers machine gun and American Browning. Soldiers were so terrified of the MG 42 that the United States Army made training movies to help the soldiers deal with the fear of going against the MG 42 in battle. At such a high rate, the human ear can not easily hear the sound of a single bullet being fired. This meant that the gun made a sound similar to "rrrrp". Allied soldiers nicknamed the MG 42 "Hitler's Buzzsaw".
When the MG 42 was fired for a long amount of time, it used a lot of ammunition. Because of this, a German MG 42 gunner would usually only fire the weapon in short bursts.
Because of the way the barrel was changed, the MG 42 could not be used on World War II German tanks. However, it could be used on one tank. This tank was called the Jagdpanzer IV. 
During World War II, every German machine gun squad had an MG 42.
The MG 42 weighed 11.8 kg. This was lighter than the MG 34. 
The MG 42 usually had a crew of six. These people were: the gun commander (the person who told the No.1 what to do with the gun), the No.1 who carried and fired the gun, the No.2 who carried the tripod, and Nos.3, 4, and 5 who carried ammunition, extra barrels and tools to dig foxholes in the ground. This big team was often cut to just three: the gunner, the loader (who loaded ammunition into the weapon and carried the barrels), and the spotter (the person who spotted targets for the gunner to shoot at). The leader of the squad and his assistant were given MP-40 submachine guns.
The MG 42 was used on nearly all German armoured vehicles. In combat, the gun's barrel could be changed in seconds.
The MG 42 was also very durable. To keep the gun working, all that was needed was some oil. The MG 42 could be dropped in mud or water and still work.
The job of many German riflemen was to support the machine gun. If the MG 42 and its crew moved, the riflemen would cover them to keep them safe. When the crew set up the MG 42, the riflemen would dig holes in the ground for the MG 42 crew to sit in. While the MG 42 was firing, the riflemen would carry ammunition to the gunners.
An MG 42 being used in a battle would usually use 3,000 rounds per day.
The MG 42 fires belt fed 7.92mm cartridges from an open bolt.
The MG 42 can only fire fully automatically. Single shots are very difficult even for people who are experienced with the MG 42. This is because of the weapon's high rate of fire.
The MG 42 barrel can be changed quickly. It has a device in the barrel to make this easier. This feature is similar to the Thompson Light Rifle.
In 1944, the Third Reich were getting short of materials. This led them to develop the MG 45 (or MG 42V). It had an even higher rate of fire and was easier to make.
The American military tried to copy the MG 42 during the war. They thought it could be a possible replacement for the Browning Automatic Rifle and the M1919A4 for foot soldiers. Saginaw Steering Gear made a prototype and called it the T24 machine gun. However, it was realised that the .30-06 cartridge that the gun would fire might be too long. There was also a design problem with the prototype. These problems meant that the project was ended.
Yugoslavia built the MG 42 at the Zavodi Crvena Zastava company as the M53 machine gun. They did this under a license. This gun still fired the 7.92 x 57mm Mauser cartridge. By doing this, the M53 was nearly an exact copy of the German MG 42. The only big difference is that the rate of fire is lower than the MG 42. Some M53s were sent to Iraq in the 1980s. They were also used a lot during both of the Gulf wars. M53 was known under nickname "Šarac".
The Beretta MG 42/59 was just the MG 42 with some small changes. This is still used by the Italian Army. The Rheinmetall MG 3 is also just the MG 42 with some changes. The MG 3 is used with the German armed forces ("Bundeswehr").
The last type of MG 42 is called the MG 74. It was developed in Austria. It has been the main machine gun of the Austrian Armed Forces since 1974.

Waziristan (/, "land of the Wazir") is a mountainous region of northwest Pakistan, bordering Afghanistan and covering about . It is part of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, which is not part of any of the country's four provinces.
Though declared by the rebels as a "state" or "emirate", there are questions whether the region being should be called such. Those who support that the region is a state point to the facts that the federal government has little to no power in the region and that the area is ruled mostly by tribal elders. The Taliban are reported to control most of the region with its own style of Sharia rule, which the Pakistan government has been unable to stop. Such bold show of autonomy has led one writer in the "Wall Street Journal" to remark that Waziristan was a "state within a state."

Chemical biology

Chemical biology is a science that combines the fields of chemistry and biology. It involves the application of chemical techniques and tools, often compounds produced through synthetic chemistry, to the study and manipulation of biological systems.
This is a slightly different from biochemistry. Biochemistry is the study of the chemistry of biological molecules. For example, a biochemist studies the three-dimensional structure of a protein and how that structure relates to the chemistry of the protein. Also, biochemistry studies the way enzymes work. Chemical biologists use chemical principles to modulate systems. They do this to either investigate biology relationships or create new functions. In this way, the research done by chemical biologists is often closer to that of cell biology than biochemistry. In short, biochemists deal with the chemistry "of" biology, chemical biologists deal with chemistry "applied to" biology.

Solid-state chemistry

Solid-state chemistry, (also called materials chemistry) is the study of the synthesis, structure, and properties of solid phase materials. It focuses on non-molecular solids. It has much in common with solid-state physics, mineralogy, crystallography, ceramics, metallurgy, thermodynamics, materials science and electronics. It focuses on the synthesis of new materials and their characterization.
Technology helps solid-state inorganic chemistry. Solid-state chemistry works to make materials used in commerce. Researchers serve industry, as well as answering academic questions. There were many important discoveries in the 20th century: zeolite and platinum-based catalysts for petroleum processing in the 1950s, high-purity silicon as a core component of microelectronic devices in the 1960s, and “high temperature” superconductivity in the 1980s. William Lawrence Bragg invented X-ray crystallography in the early 1900s, which brought further discoveries.
Carl Wagner's worked on oxidation rate theory, counter diffusion of ions, and defect chemistry. This work showed how reactions proceed at the atomic level in the solid state. Because of this, he has sometimes been referred to as the "father of solid state chemistry".
A diverse variety of syntheic methods are used to make solid-state compounds. For organic materials, such as charge transfer salts, the methods operate near room temperature and are often similar to the methods of organic synthesis. Redox reactions are sometimes conducted by electrocrystallisation. For example, Bechgaard salts can be made from tetrathiafulvalene.
For materials that can withstand heat, chemists often use high temperature methods. For example, chemists use tube furnaces to prepare bulk solids. This allows reactions to be conducted up to around . For higher temperatures up to , chemists use special equipment such as ovens made with a tantalum tube through which an electric current is passed. Such high temperatures are at times required to induce diffusion of the reactants. But this depends strongly on the system studied. Some solid state reactions already proceed at temperatures as low as .
Chemists often melt the reactants together and then later anneal the solidified melt. If volatile reactants are involved, the reactants are often put in an ampoule and then all air is removed. Often, the chemists keep the reactant mixture cold (for example, by keeping the bottom of the ampoule in liquid nitrogen) and then seal the ampoule. The sealed ampoule is then put in an oven and given a specified heat treatment.
Solvents can be used to prepare solids by precipitation or by evaporation. At times the solvent is used under pressure at temperatures higher than the normal boiling point (hydrothermally). Flux methods add a salt of relatively low melting point to the mixture to act as a high temperature solvent in which the desired reaction can take place.
Many solids react readily with reactive gases such as chlorine, iodine, oxygen or others. Others solids form adducts with other gases, (for example CO or ethylene). Such reactions are often carried out in a tube with open ended on both sides and through which the gas flows. A variation of this is to let the reaction take place inside a measuring device such as a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In that case stoichiometric information can be obtained during the reaction. That information helps identify the products. (By accurately measuring the amount of each reactant, chemists can guess the ratio of the atoms in the final products.)
A special case of a gas reaction is a chemical transport reaction. These are often carried out by adding a small amount of a transport agent (for example, iodine) to a sealed ampoule. The ampoule is then placed in a zone oven. This method can be used to obtain the product in the form of single crystals suitable for structure determination by X-ray diffraction (XRD).
Chemical vapor deposition is also a widely used high temperature method for the preparation of coatings and semiconductors from molecular precursors.
Many solids attract water (hygroscopic) and/or sensitive to oxygen. For example, many halides absorb water and can only be studied in their anhydrous form if they are handled in a glove box filled with dry (and/or oxygen-free) gas, usually nitrogen.
Because a new synthetic method produces a mixture of products, it is important to be able to identify and characterize specific solid-state materials. Chemists try changing the stoichiometry to find which stoichiometries will lead to new solid compounds or to solid solutions between known ones. A prime method to characterize the reaction products is powder diffraction, because many solid state reactions will produce polycristalline ingots or powders. Powder diffraction will help the identification of known phases in the mixture. If a pattern is found that is not known in the diffraction data libraries an attempt can be made to index the pattern, that is to identify the symmetry and the size of the unit cell. (If the product is not crystalline the characterization is much more difficult.)
Once the unit cell of a new phase is known, the next step is to establish the ratio of the elements (stoichiometry) of the phase. This can be done in a number of ways. Sometimes the composition of the original mixture will give a clue, if one finds only one product (a single powder pattern) or if one was trying to make a phase of a certain composition by analogy to known materials. But this is rare.
Often chemist work hard to improve the synthetic methodology to get a pure sample of the new material.
If chemists can separate the product from the rest of the reaction mixture, then chemists can use elemental analysis on the isolated product. Other ways involve Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the generation of characteristic X-rays in the electron beam. The easiest way is to solve the structure is by using single crystal X-ray diffraction.
Improving the preparative procedures requires chemists to study which phases are stable at what composition and what stoichiometry. In other words, the chemists draw the phase diagram of the substance. An important tools in finding the phase diagram data are thermal analysis such as DSC or DTA and increasingly also, thanks to the advent of synchrotrons temperature-dependent power diffraction. Increased knowledge of the phase relations often leads to further refinement in synthetic procedures which repeats the cycle. New phases are thus characterized by their melting points and their stoichiometric domains. Identifying stichiometric domains is important for the many solids that are non-stoichiometric compounds. The cell parameters obtained from XRD are particularly helpful to characterize the homogeneity ranges of non-stoichiometric compounds.
In many cases new solid compounds are further characterized by a variety of techniques from solid-state physics.
For non-metallic materials, chemists try to get ultra-violet/visible spectra. In the case of semiconductors that will give an idea of the band gap.
Four-point (or five-point) probe methods are often applied either to ingots, crystals or pressed pellets to measure resistivity and the size of the Hall effect. This gives information on whether the compound is an insulator, semiconductor, semimetal or metal and upon the type of doping and the mobility in the delocalized bands (if present). So, important information is obtained on the chemical bonding in the material.
Magnetic susceptibility can be measured as function of temperature to establish whether the material is a para-, ferro- or antiferro- magnet. This tells the bonding in the material. This is particularly important for transition metal compounds. In the case of magnetic order, neutron diffraction can be used to find the magnetic structure.

Odontochelys

Odontochelys is the oldest known turtle to have been discovered. It was first described from three 220 million year-old specimens excavated in Upper Triassic rocks in Guizhou, China.
As a primitive turtle, "Odontochelys" differed from modern turtles in several ways. Modern turtles possess a horny beak without any teeth in their mouth. In contrast, "Odontochelys" fossils had teeth in their upper and lower jaws. 
One of the most striking features of turtles, both modern and prehistoric alike, are their dorsal shells, forming an armored carapace over the body of the animal. "Odontochelys" only had the bottom portion of a turtle's armor, the plastron. It did not yet have a solid carapace as most other turtles do. Instead of a solid carapace, "Odontochelys" had broadened ribs like those of modern turtle embryos that still have not started developing the ossified plates of a carapace.
In a comparison of skull proportions, the skull of "Odontochelys" is far more elongated in front of the eyes compared to other turtles. The tail of the prehistoric turtle was longer in proportion to its body than other turtles. In addition, the transverse processes found in the tail are not fused such as in later turtles. 
Taken together, these anatomical differences mean that "Odontochelys" has some of the most primitive features ever seen in a turtle and is somewhat of a transitional fossil. Some scientists, however, are skeptical of this idea. Reisz and Head suggest that "Odontochelys" does not represent a turtle with a partly evolved shell, but that it is a descendant of an older, land–living turtle, and that the shell became reversed. Such shells can be seen on modern turtles, like the leatherback turtles (the genus "Dermochelys").
It is likely that "Odontochelys" was aquatic, as the fossil specimens were found in marine deposits full of conodonts and ammonites. The primitive turtle swam in shallow marine waters close to shore.
The species' name, "Odontochelys semitestacea" literally means "toothed turtle with a half-shell" - an apt description of its most striking physical characteristics.

Band gap

A band gap, also called a bandgap or energy gap, is an energy range in a solid where no electron states can exist. The term is used in solid-state physics and chemistry.
Band gaps can be found in insulators and semiconductors. In graphs of the electronic band structure of solids, the band gap is the energy difference (in electron volts) between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band. This is the same as the energy needed to free an outer shell electron from its orbit about the nucleus to become a mobile charge carrier. The free electron is able to move freely within the solid material. So the band gap is a major factor determining the electrical conductivity of a solid. Substances with large band gaps are generally insulators, those with smaller band gaps are semiconductors. Conductors either have very small band gaps or no band gap if the energy levels of valence and conduction bands overlap.
Scientist use the band gap to predict if a solid will conduct electricity. Most electrons (called valance electrons) are attracted to the nucleus of just one atom. But if an electron has enough energy to fly away from its nearest nucleus, it can join in the flow of electric current across the many atoms that make up the solid. The electrons that are not tightly attached to just one nucleus are called the conduction band.
In semiconductors and insulators, quantum mechanics show that electrons are only found in a number of bands of energy. Electrons are forbidden from other energy levels. The term "band gap" refers to the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band. Electrons are able to jump from one band to another. However, an electron needs a certain amount of energy to jump from a valence band to a conduction band. The amount of energy needed differs with different materials. Electrons can gain enough energy to jump to the conduction band by absorbing either a phonon (heat) or a photon (light).
A semiconductor is a material with a small but nonzero band gap which behaves as an insulator at absolute zero temperature (0 K) but allows heat to excite electrons enough to jump into its conduction band at temperatures which are below its melting point. In contrast, a material with a large band gap is an insulator. In conductors, the valence and conduction bands may overlap, so they may not have a band gap.
The conductivity of intrinsic semiconductors is strongly dependent on the band gap. The only available carriers for conduction are the electrons which have enough thermal energy to be excited across the band gap.
Band gap engineering is the process of controlling or altering the band gap of a material by controlling the composition of certain semiconductor alloys, such as GaAlAs, InGaAs, and InAlAs. It is also possible to construct layered materials with alternating compositions by techniques like molecular beam epitaxy. These methods are used in the design of heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs), laser diodes and solar cells.
It is hard to draw a line between semiconductors and insulators. One way is to think of semiconductors as a type of insulator with a narrow band gap. Insulators with a larger band gap, usually greater than 3 eV, are not put into the semiconductor group and generally do not exhibit semiconductive behavior under practical conditions. Electron mobility also plays a role in determining a material's informal grouping as a semiconductor.
The band gap energy of semiconductors tends to decrease with increasing temperature. When temperature increases, the amplitude of atomic vibrations increase, leading to larger interatomic spacing. The interaction between the lattice phonons and the free electrons and holes will also affect the band gap a little. The relationship between band gap energy and temperature can be described by Varshni's empirical expression,
In a regular semiconductor crystal, the band gap is fixed owing to continuous energy states. In a quantum dot crystal, the band gap is size dependent and can be altered to produce a range of energies between the valence band and conduction band. It is also known as quantum confinement effect.
Band gaps also depend on pressure. Band gaps can be either direct or indirect, depending on the electronic band structure.
Classically, the ratio of probabilities that two states with an energy difference "ΔE" will be occupied by an electron is given by the Boltzmann factor:
where:
At the Fermi level (or chemical potential), the probability of a state being occupied is ½. If the Fermi level is in the middle of a band gap of 1 eV, this probability is "e" or about 2.0⋅10 at the room-temperature thermal energy of 25.9 meV.
Electrons can be excited by light as well as by heat. The band gap determines what portion of the solar spectrum a photovoltaic cell absorbs. A luminescent solar converter uses a luminescent medium to downconvert photons with energies above the band gap to photon energies closer to the band gap of the semiconductor comprising the solar cell.
In photonics band gaps or stop bands are ranges of photon frequencies where, if tunneling effects are neglected, no photons can be transmitted through a material. A material exhibiting this behaviour is called a "photonic crystal".
Similar physics applies to phonons in a phononic crystal.

Deal or No Deal (UK game show)

Deal or No Deal is the British version of the game show franchise of the same name. It is presented by Noel Edmonds, and produced by Endemol. It began showing in 2005. Players can win £250,000 (US$388,800). The odds of winning it is only 4 in 1715 (1 in 429, or 2 in 858). This is because a player might take a offer from the banker.
The show is on Channel 4 at 4p.m. on weekdays. It runs for 60 minutes, including adverts.
Before the game starts, different amounts of money are packed randomly into 22 suitcases. A player is selected, and the case that they have is randomly selected.
In front of the player is a game board with all the possible amounts that could be in his/her box. The player then opens 5 boxes. Five possible amounts that could be in the player's box are gone. Based on the amounts left (that could be in the players box), the "banker" may make an offer to buy the box from the player. The offer depends on the possible amounts that could be in the player's box according to what is left on the board. So if there are high amounts that are on the board (that could be in the person's box), the banker will pay more to buy the box. He might offer £10,000 instead of £3,500 or £1500. The player may take the offer by saying "deal" of refuse it by saying "no deal".
The player then opens 3 more boxes, and the banker will make another offer. If after 6 offers, the player says "no deal", they win whatever is in their box. If they says "deal" at an offer, the player takes home the offer. The game ends, but they play on to see what would have happened otherwise.

Moves Like Jagger

"Moves Like Jagger" is a dance pop single released by American pop rock band Maroon 5 on June 22, 2011 internationally and digitally. The single features pop singer-songwriter Christina Aguilera and was produced by Shellback, Benny Blanco, and Ari Levine. The song was later put on the Maroon 5 album "Hands All Over" in July of 2011 for the re-release. The song peaked at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 singles' chart for four weeks and number-one on the Billboard Digital Songs chart for three weeks. The song will not feature on the upcoming fourth studio album "Overexposed", which is scheduled for release on June 26, 2012.
The song's lyrics refer to a male protagonist's ability to impress a female with his dance moves, which he compares to those of The Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger. The song received a positive critical appreciation, many of them complimented the vocal chemistry between Levine and Aguilera and labeled it "an irresistible summer hit".
The music video for "Moves Like Jagger" was directed by Jonas Åkerlund and filmed in Los Angeles, California on July 8, 2011. On July 9, Aguilera posted an image of herself from the video shoot via Twitter, saying, "Always great to see Jonas Akerlund. He created the perfect feel for the song. Expect a fun video." The image showed Aguilera performing with a band in front of a background of the American flag. Four shirtless images of Levine from the shoot were also released online the same day. More images from the video shoot were released online on July 11, showing Levine and Aguilera performing in front of an American and British-themed backdrop with confetti falling from the ceiling. Another image showed Aguilera performing in front of a black backdrop with her name "Christina" shown in pink. Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger made an appearance in the video "via archive footage." The music video premiered on August 8 on E!

David Edward Walliams (born Williams; 20 August 1971) is an English comedian, writer and actor, known for his partnership with Matt Lucas on the TV sketch show "Little Britain" and its predecessor "Rock Profile". More recently he and Lucas wrote and starred in "Come Fly with Me".
In September 2011, he swam the entire 140 mile length of the River Thames, raising over £1,000,000 for a charity called Sport Relief.
Born in the London Borough of Merton on 20 August 1971 to Peter, a London Transport engineer, and Kathleen Williams, a lab technician, Williams was brought up in Banstead. His parents appeared on "The Friday Night Project" when he was the guest star on the show. He was educated at Collingwood Boys' School in Wallington (now Collingwood School) and the independent Reigate Grammar School (where he was a contemporary of Robert Shearman). He was a member of the National Youth Theatre, where he met Matt Lucas. Williams studied drama at the University of Bristol from 1989 to 1992, one year below Simon Pegg.
Williams changed his name to Walliams () when he joined the actors' trade union, Equity, as there was already a member named David Williams. This was spoofed in a mock interview on "Rock Profile", when Robbie Williams was continuously referred to as 'Robbie Walliams'.

Superbase

In chemistry, a superbase is an extremely strong base. It is a compound that has a high affinity for protons.
Hydroxide ion is the strongest base possible in water (aqueous) solutions, but superbases are much stronger than aqueous bases. Such bases are useful in organic synthesis and are fundamental to physical organic chemistry. 
Superbases have been described and used since the 1850s. Reactions involving superbases often require special techniques since they are destroyed by water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen in the air. Inert atmosphere techniques and low temperatures minimize these side reactions.
IUPAC defines superbases simply as a "compound having a very high basicity, such as lithium diisopropylamide".

Chemical species

Chemical species are atoms, molecules, molecular fragments, ions, etc., being subjected to a chemical process or to a measurement. Generally, a chemical species can be defined as an ensemble of chemically identical molecular entities that can explore the same set of molecular energy levels on a defined time scale. Chemists also use chemical species to mean a set of chemically identical atomic or molecular structural units in a solid array.
For example, when molecules of NaCl dissolve in water we don't really have any NaCl as such in the solution. We have Na and Cl ions because NaCl dissociates. We say the species present in solution are Na(aq) and Cl(aq). In this case, the species present in solution are the ions. In other cases, where the molecules don't dissolve in water, we would have molecular species in solution rather than ionic species.
In supramolecular chemistry, chemical species are those supramolecular structures whose interactions and associations are brought about by forming or breaking intermolecular bonds. Studying these actions is the main topic of supramolecular chemistry.

Blind spot (vision)

A blind spot is a part of the visual field our brains get no information from. It is the place in the visual field that corresponds to the lack of light-detecting photoreceptor cells where the optic nerve passes through the optic disc of the retina. Since there are no cells to detect light on the optic disc, a part of the field of vision is not perceived. The brain fills in with surrounding detail with information from the other eye, so the blind spot is not normally perceived.
Although all vertebrates have this blind spot, cephalopod eyes, which are superficially similar, do not. In them, the optic nerve approaches the receptors from behind, so it does not create a break in the retina.
The first documented observation of the phenomenon was in the 1660s by Edme Mariotte in France. At the time it was generally thought that the point at which the optic nerve entered the eye should actually be the most sensitive portion of the retina; however, Mariotte's discovery disproved this theory.
As to why the blind spot is normally not seen, there are two theories. One, less favoured, is that it is simply ignored by the brain. The other is that they are 'filled in' by the brain with information from surrounding areas. Perception theorists have generally favoured this second hypothesis. The filling-in works with quite complex and unusual visual patterns, suggesting an active brain process works to mimic patterns surrounding the blind spot.
These natural blind spots are present only in the eyes of vertebrates. Cephalopods have their optic nerves attached to the back of the retina, so they are not a problem. The vertebrate eye is illogical because light must go through and past the nerve fibres before getting to the retina.
This comes about because vertebrate eyes are outgrowths from the brain; they grow outward from the embryological tissue which forms the brain.

<doc id="308068" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=308068" title="Chondroitin sulfate">
Chondroitin sulfate

Chondroitin sulfate is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG). It is a chain of alternating sugars (N-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid). It is usually found attached to proteins as part of a proteoglycan. A chondroitin chain can have over 100 individual sugars, each of which can be sulfated in variable positions and quantities. Chondroitin sulfate is an important structural component of cartilage and provides much of its resistance to compression. Along with glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate has become a widely used dietary supplement for treatment of osteoarthritis. It is commonly extracted from shark cartilage.
Chondroitin sulfate was originally isolated well before chemists learned its structure. So, its name changed over time. Early researchers identified different types of the substance with letters.
"Chondroitin sulfate B" is an old name for dermatan sulfate, and it is no longer classified as a form of chondroitin sulfate.
"Chondroitin", without the "sulfate", has been used to describe a type with little or no sulfation. However, this distinction is not used by all.
The name "chondroitin sulfate" sounds like a salt with a sulfate counter-anion. This is not the case. The sulfate is attached to the sugar with a covalent bond. Since the molecule has multiple negative charges at physiological pH, a cation is present in salts of chondroitin sulfate. Commercial preparations of chondroitin sulfate typically are the sodium salt. Barnhill et al. have suggested that all such preparations of chondroitin sulfate be referred to as "sodium chondroitin" regardless of their sulfation status.
Chondroitin sulfate chains are unbranched polysaccharides of variable length containing two alternating monosaccharides: D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc). Some GlcA residues are epimerized into L-iduronic acid (IdoA); the resulting disaccharide is then referred to as dermatan sulfate.
Chondroitin sulfate chains are linked to hydroxyl groups on serine residues of certain proteins. Exactly how proteins are selected for attachment of glycosaminoglycans is not understood. Glycosylated serines are often followed by a glycine and have neighboring acidic residues. But this does not always predict glycosylation.
Attachment of the GAG chain begins with four monosaccharides in a fixed pattern: Xyl - Gal - Gal - GlcA. Each sugar is attached by a specific enzyme, allowing for multiple levels of control over GAG synthesis. Xylose begins to be attached to proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, while the rest of the sugars are attached in the Golgi apparatus.
Each monosaccharide may be left unsulfated, sulfated once, or sulfated twice. In the most common case, the hydroxyls of the 4 and 6 positions of the N-acetyl-galactosamine are sulfated, with some chains having the 2 position of glucuronic acid. Sulfation is mediated by specific sulfotransferases. Sulfation in these different positions gives specific biological activities to chondroitin GAG chains.
Chondroitin's functions depend largely on the properties of the overall proteoglycan of which it is a part. These functions can be broadly divided into structural and regulatory roles. Some proteoglycans have both structural and regulatory roles (see versican).
Chondroitin sulfate is a major component of extracellular matrix, and is important in maintaining the structural integrity of tissue. This function is typical of the large aggregating proteoglycans: aggrecan, versican, brevican, and neurocan, collectively termed the lecticans.
As part of aggrecan, chondroitin sulfate is a major component of cartilage. The tightly packed and highly charged sulfate groups of chondroitin sulfate generate electrostatic repulsion that provides much of the resistance of cartilage to compression. Loss of chondroitin sulfate from the cartilage is a major cause of osteoarthritis.
Chondroitin sulfate readily interacts with proteins in the extracellular matrix due to its negative charges. These interactions are important for regulating many cellular activities. The lecticans are a major part of the brain extracellular matrix, where the chondroitin sugar chains function to stabilize normal brain synapses as part of perineuronal nets. The levels of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are vastly increased after injury to the central nervous system where they act to prevent regeneration of damaged nerve endings. Although these functions are not as well characterized as those of heparan sulfate, new roles continue to be discovered for the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans.
In cortical development, chondroitin sulfate is expressed by the Sub Plate and acts as a stop signal for neurons migrating from the Ventricular Zone. Neurons stopping here may then be programmed for further migration to specific layers in the cortical plate.
Chondroitin is in dietary supplements used as an alternative medicine to treat osteoarthritis and also approved and regulated as a symptomatic slow-acting drug for this disease (SYSADOA) in Europe and some other countries. It is commonly sold together with glucosamine. Chondroitin and glucosamine are also used in veterinary medicine.

Walter Gilbert (born March 21, 1932) is an American physicist, biochemist, molecular biology pioneer, and Nobel laureate. He helped develop DNA sequence analysis.
Gilbert was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on March 21, 1932. Gilbert attended Harvard University for undergraduate and graduate studies, earning a first degree in chemistry and physics in 1953 and a master's degree in physics in 1954. 
Gilbert's doctoral work was done at the University of Cambridge, where he earned his PhD in mathematics under the mentorship of Nobel laureate Abdus Salam in 1957.
Gilbert returned to Harvard in 1957 and promoted in 1968 to professor of biochemistry. In 1969, Gilbert was given Harvard's Ledlie Prize. In 1972, Gilbert was named American Cancer Society Professor of Molecular Biology.
He is a co-founder of the biotech start-up companies Biogen and Myriad Genetics. Gilbert is currently the chairman of the Harvard Society of Fellows.
Together with Allan Maxam, Gilbert developed a new DNA sequencing method in 1976. With George Church he developed the first direct genomic sequencing method in 1984. 
Gilbert first proposed the existence of introns and exons and explained the evolution of introns in a seminal 1978 "News and Views" paper published in "Nature". In 1986, Gilbert used the phrase RNA world hypothesis for the origin of life. 'RNA World' was a concept first proposed by Carl Woese in 1967.
Gilbert was given the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, shared with Frederick Sanger and Paul Berg. Gilbert and Sanger were recognized for their pioneering work in devising methods for determining the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid.
Among many other awards, Gilbert was made a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1987.

The optic chiasma, or 'optic chiasm', is the part of the brain where the optic nerves (CN II) partially cross. The optic chiasm is located at the bottom of the brain immediately below the hypothalamus.
The images on the nasal (inner) sides of each retina cross over to the opposite side of the brain via the optic nerve at the optic chiasm. The temporal (outer) images, on the other hand, stay on the same side. This allows the images from either side of the visual field to go to the appropriate side of the brain, combining the sides together. 
Beyond the optic chiasm, with crossed and uncrossed fibers, optic nerves become optic tracts. 
This system allows for parts of both eyes that attend to the right visual field to be processed in the left visual system in the brain, and vice versa.

Chimaera (fish)

Chimaeras are cartilaginous fish in the order Chimaeriformes. They are sometimes known informally as 'ghost sharks'.
They may be the "oldest and most enigmatic groups of fishes alive today. Their closest living relatives are sharks, though in evolutionary terms they branched off from sharks nearly 400 million years ago and have remained isolated ever since.
At one time they were a "diverse and abundant" group, based on the fossil record. They are now confined mainly to deep water. There are 50 living species in six genera and three families. The evolution of these species has been problematic given the paucity of good fossils. DNA sequences have become the preferred approach to understanding speciation.
The order appears to have originated about 420 million years ago during the Silurian. The three living families appear to have diverged during the late Jurassic to early Cretaceous (170–120 million years ago.
They do not have shark-like skin or teeth. They have smooth scales on their bodies, and three pairs of grinding tooth plates. They have a poisonous spine on their backs between the head and the dorsal fin.
Otherwise, they are rather like other Chondrichthyes. They have skeletons are made of cartilage. They use claspers for internal fertilization of females. They lay eggs with leathery cases. They use electroreception to find their prey, which is also common in rays.

Mainframe computer

Mainframes (also called "big iron") are powerful computers used for large data processing jobs. They are mainly used by government institutions and large companies for tasks such as census, industry and consumer statistics, enterprise resource planning, and financial transaction processing. The mainframe computers are specially used as servers on the World Wide Web (WWW).
The term originally referred to the large cabinets that housed the central processing unit and main memory of early computers. Later the term was used to distinguish very big computers from less powerful ones ("minicomputers" or "personal computers").

Youth

Youth is the opposite of elderly. When something is new, it can be called young. Sometimes "young" is only for living things, and things that are not alive are"new". 
Old can refer to someone or something's age.
Young can mean that something is current to date or well before its "best by" date.
Different things lose their youth or grow old at different rates. For example, technology has a short life span and can only be considered young for roughly one year. In many countries, humans are no longer young at 18 or 20 years old.
For some people, youth is an obsession. They want to look young. Because of this, they use various products like face cream and plastic surgery, to stop or slow their looking older. The "Fountain of Youth" was a popular myth, and people thought that if you took water from the fountain, you would never be old. Now however, we know that this "was" a myth, and it was not magical at all.

Simplified molecular input line entry specification

The simplified molecular input line entry specification or SMILES is a line notation for the chemical structure of molecules. It uses a short series ASCII characters to represent structures. Most molecule editor computer programs can draw a two-dimensional diagram or a three-dimensional model of a molecule based on its SMILES code.
Arthur Weininger and David Weininger wrote the original SMILES specification in the late 1980s. It has since been modified and extended by others, including by Daylight Chemical Information Systems Inc. In 2007, the Blue Obelisk open-source chemistry community developed an open standard called "OpenSMILES".
In July 2006, the IUPAC introduced the InChI as a standard line notation for representing chemical structures. People think that it is easier for humans to understand SMILES than InChI. Some chemists argue that SMILES is better than InChI because many different software programs support it. SMILES also has theoretical (for example, graph theory) backing.
SMILES can be converted back to 2-dimensional representations using Structure Diagram Generation algorithms. This conversion can sometimes be ambiguous. Because SMILES just says which atoms are connected without any information about the angles between chemical bonds, computer programs use energy minimization to convert SMILES to 3-dimensional representations. There are many downloadable and web-based conversion utilities.
Here are some examples of the SMILES for molecules:

Insulin resistance

Insulin resistance is a serious condition in which insulin becomes less able to lower the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Usually, insulin helps sugar move out of the blood and into the body's cells. In the cells, the body can use sugar to make energy. If this does not happen correctly, too much sugar stays in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia. If the blood glucose level is above normal for a long time, this can lead to major health problems. 
Insulin resistance often causes certain types of diabetes mellitus, especially type 2 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes of adults. A condition called 'metabolic syndrome' is strongly tied to insulin resistance.

Cheminformatics

Cheminformatics (also known as chemoinformatics and chemical informatics) is the study of large amounts of chemical information. It is done mostly with the help of computers. These tools are used by pharmaceutical companies to discovery new drugs. 
Cheminformatics uses computer science and information technology to help solve chemistry problems. Cheminformatics deals with algorithms, databases and information systems, web technologies, artificial intelligence and soft computing, information and computation theory, software engineering, data mining, image processing, modeling and simulation, signal processing, discrete mathematics, control and system theory, circuit theory, and statistics, for generating new knowledge of chemistry. 
The term chemoinformatics was defined by F.K. Brown in 1998: 
Cheminformatics combines the scientific working fields of chemistry and computer science.
Cheminformatics can also be applied to data analysis for the paper, pulp and dye industries.
The primary application of cheminformatics is in the storage of information relating to compounds. The efficient search of such stored information includes topics that are dealt with in computer science as data mining and machine learning.
Computers represent chemical structures in specialized formats such as the XML-based Chemical Markup Language or SMILES. While some formats are suited for visual representations in 2 or 3 dimensions, others are more suited for studying physical interactions, modeling and docking studies.
Chemical data can pertain to real or virtual molecules. Virtual compounds may be used to explore chemical space and predict new 
compounds with desired properties.
Virtual libraries of classes of compounds (drugs, natural products, diversity-oriented synthetic products) were recently generated using the FOG (fragment optimized growth) algorithm.
Instead og testing the actual chemicals, virtual screening involves
screening compounds by computer, to identify members likely to possess desired properties such as biological activity against a given target. 
This is to predict the activity of compounds from their structures. These studies link cheminofrmatics to chemometrics. Chemical expert systems are also relevant. They represent parts of chemical knowledge in computers.

Alexander Oparin

Alexander Ivanovich Oparin (Uglich, Russia, – Moscow, 21 April 1980) was a Soviet biochemist.
He was notable for his ideas on the origin of life, and for writing an early book "The Origin of Life". One of his ideas was that oxygen would tend to destroy organic molecules essential for the evolution of early life. It was later found that the earth's atmosphere at first had almost no oxygen in it.
He also studied the biochemistry of plants, and enzyme reactions in plant cells. He developed the foundations for industrial biochemistry in the USSR.
These were some of the main ideas in his first book:
1. There is no fundamental difference between a living organism and lifeless matter. Life must have arisen as a natural evolution of matter. 
2. Methane is in the atmospheres of Jupiter and the other giant planets. Oparin thought the infant Earth had a strongly reducing atmosphere, containing methane, ammonia, hydrogen, and water vapor. In his opinion, these were the raw materials for the evolution of life.
3. At first there were the simple solutions of organic substances. Their behaviour was governed by their atoms and by the arrangement of those atoms in molecules. Gradually, as the result of the growth and increased complexity of the molecules, structures with new properties developed. These newer properties were determined by the spatial and mutual arrangement of the molecules. 
4. In this process biological orderliness already exists. Competition, speed of cell growth, survival of the fittest, struggle for existence and, finally natural selection produced the characteristics of living things. 
Oparin outlined a way in which basic organic chemicals might form into microscopic localized systems. These would be precursors of the cell from which primitive living things could develop. He cited work done with organic chemicals which, in solution, form droplets and layers. Oparin suggested that different types might have formed in the Earth's primordial ocean. They were subject to a selection process leading eventually to life.

Sy Oliver

Melvin "Sy" Oliver (17 December 1910 in Battle Creek, Michigan – 28 May 1988 in New York City) was a jazz arranger, trumpeter, composer, singer, and band leader. His mother was a piano teacher and his father was a multi-instrumentalist who made a name for himself demonstrating saxophones at a time that instrument was little used outside of marching bands.
Oliver left home at 17 to play with Zack Whyte and his Chocolate Beau Brummels and later with Alphonse Trent. He sang and played trumpet with these bands, becoming known for his "growling" horn playing.
Sy arranged and conducted many songs for Ella Fitzgerald from her years with Decca Records. As a composer, one of his most famous songs was "T'ain't What You Do (It's the Way That You Do It)" which he co-wrote with Trummy Young.
He joined Jimmie Lunceford's band in 1933 and contributed many hit arrangements to the band, including "My Blue Heaven" and "Ain't She Sweet". In 1939, he became one of the first African Americans with a prominent role in a white band when he joined Tommy Dorsey as an arranger, though he stopped playing trumpet at that time. (Fletcher Henderson joined the Benny Goodman orchestra as the arranger in the same year.) He led the transition of the Dorsey band from Dixieland to modern big band. His joining was instrumental in Buddy Rich's decision to join Dorsey. His arrangement of "On the Sunny Side of the Street" was a big hit for Dorsey, as were his own compositions "Yes Indeed" (a gospel-jazz tune that was later recorded by Ray Charles), "Opus One," "The Minor is Muggin'," "T.D.'s Boogie Woogie," and "Well, Git It."
After leaving Dorsey, Oliver continued working as a free-lance arranger. One of his more successful such efforts was the Frank Sinatra album "I Remember Tommy", a combined tribute to each man's former boss---and as music director for Decca Records.
In later years, up until 1980, he led his own jazz band, for which he took up the trumpet again.

Aristolochiaceae

The Aristolochiaceae, or Birthwort family, are a family of flowering plants with seven genera and about 400 species belonging to the order Piperales. The type genus is "Aristolochia" L.
They are mostly perennial, herbaceous plants, shrubs, woody vines or even lianas.
The membranous, cordate simple leaves are spread out, growing alternately along the stem on leaf stalks. The margins are commonly entire. There are no stipules.
The bizarre flowers are large to medium-sized, growing in the leaf axils. They are bilaterally or radially symmetrical.
The Aristolochiaceae are magnoliids, a basal group of angiosperms which are not part of the large categories of monocots or eudicots.
Some newer classification schemes place the family Aristolochiaceae in the order Piperales.
Many members of "Aristolochia" and some of "Asarum" contain the toxin aristolochic acid, which defence against predators, in this case herbivores. It is known to be carcinogenic in rats. "Aristolochia" itself is carcinogenic to humans.
Pipevine swallowtail butterflies lay their eggs on pipevine ("Aristolochia" species), and the larvae dine on the plant but are not affected by the toxin, which then offers the adult butterfly protection against predators.

Context (language)

Context is what surrounds a word or piece of text. Context can be used to understand words which people do not know the meaning of.
In print, a word, phrase or sentence has other text around it. This helps the reader to understand the piece in question. In speech, the social setting as well as the language help the listener to understand what is said.
Something like: "You can take it whenever you need to" might refer to almost anything. However, if it is said by a doctor to a patient, then the context is clear, and the listener can guess it refers to some kind of medication. So the context is what goes with a text (written or spoken) which helps the reader (or listener) understand the communication.

2011 Sindh floods

The 2011 Sindh floods started during mid-August 2011 because of a lot of rain in Sindh, Eastern Balochistan, and Southern Punjab. The floods have caused a lot of damage. 270 people died, and 5.3 million people were affected. 1.2 million homes were sunk. Sindh is considered a "good" region and often called the "breakfast" of the country. The damage caused by the floods in the area is large. At least 1.7 million acres of land have been ruined because of the flooding. The flooding is the worst since the 2010 floods in Pakistan.
In the month of July, Pakistan had low monsoon rains, however in August and September the country received "above normal" monsoon rains. A strong weather pattern entered the areas of Sindh from the Indian states of Rajasthan and Gujarat in August and gained strength with the passage of time and caused heavy downpours. The four-week long continuous rains have created floods in Sindh that have never been seen before.

Rohypnol

Rohypnol is the common name for a drug called flunitrazepam. A slang term for it is roofies. The drug is sold legally, and it has many medical uses. It is a strong hypnotic (a drug that causes sleep); a sedative (causing relaxation and sleepiness); an anticonvulsant (fighting seizures); an anxiolytic (relieving anxiety); amnestic (causing forgetfulness); and skeletal muscle relaxant. Most often, it is used as a treatment for sleep disorders like insomnia. It is thought to be one of the most effective hypnotic medications.
Like other hypnotics, flunitrazepam should be used only on a short-term basis or in those with serious insomnia on an occasional basis.
Flunitrazepam is often called a date rape drug because it is very powerful, has strong effects, and can cause strong amnesia (causing a person to forget what happened after taking the drug). 
Benzodiazepines were created in 1957 by Roche, a healthcare and pharmaceutical company. Roche started selling flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) in 1975. At first, hospitals used the drug when a patient needed a deep sleep. It was sold commercially in 1975 in Europe, and in the 1990s in the United States. The drug was given the brand name Rohypnol.
Rohypnol is usually taken by mouth. It has a long active period its effects can last 18 to 26 hours, and it can be found in urine and blood tests. This means that the day after taking the drug, a person may keep feeling tired and having trouble with thinking and balance. Even after a full day, driving a car may still be dangerous. 
The drug is often involved in drug intoxication, including overdoses. Overdose of flunitrazepam may cause long-term sedation, poor balance, and poor speech. In serious overdoses, people may have breathing problems, coma, and possibly death. The overdose will be worse if flunitrazepam is taken with depressants, like alcohol or opiates. Flunitrazepam overdose can be treated with flumazenil. 
Rohypnol has become widely known in the USA for its use as a date rape drug. However, people more commonly use it as a recreational drug. It is used by high school and college students, rave party members, and heroin and cocaine users (who call a tablet of flunitrazepam a "roofie").
Some of the street names for Rohypnol are:

Sponge cake

Sponge cake is a cake made of flour (usually wheat flour), sugar, and eggs.
Some people thought that the sponge cake was one of the first non-yeasted cakes.
The Victoria sponge cake was named after Queen Victoria, who ate a slice of sponge cake with her afternoon tea. It is usually called simply "sponge cake". A traditional Victoria sponge cake has raspberry jam and whipped double cream or vanilla cream. If there is only jam, it is called 'jam sponge' and not a Victoria sponge. The jam and cream are between two sponge cakes; the top of the cake is not iced or decorated.
Other names for the Victoria sponge are Victoria Sandwich and Victorian Cake, although 'Victorian Cake' is not used often.
Although they are simple to make, bakers must be careful when it comes to cooking times and temperatures. Because of that, oven factories often use a Victoria sponge recipe to test their ovens.

Metabolic syndrome

Metabolic syndrome is a combination of medical issues which increase the risk for heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. Twenty five percent of United States population have metabolic syndrome.
The term "metabolic syndrome" dates back to at least the late 1950s, but came into common usage in the late 1970s to describe various associations of risk factors with diabetes mellitus that had been noted as early as the 1920s.

A palatal consonant is a consonant that is pronounced with the body (the middle part) of the tongue against the hard palate (which is the middle part of the roof of the mouth). There is only one palatal consonant in English which is , which is the sound for "y" in the English word "yes". The most common palatal consonant used in the world is .

Approximant consonant

An approximant consonant is a consonant that sounds in some ways like a vowel. For example, lateral approximants like the sound for "l" in the English word "like", the sound for "r" in the English word "right", and semivowels like the sound for "y" in "yes" and the sound for "w" in "wet" are all approximants. These sounds are pronounced by bringing two parts of the mouth, for example the tongue and the roof of the mouth, close to each other. However, it is not close enough to cause the air to be blocked, like in a fricative consonant. Also, the parts are not far apart enough to become a vowel.
Semivowels are a type of approximant consonant, which sound like vowels if you pronounced them alone. However, many languages use them as consonants. Here are the common semivowels in the International Phonetic Alphabet. 
In lateral approximants, only the centre of the tongue touches the roof of the mouth. So, air can only flow through the sides of the tongue, like the sound "l" in "like".

Windows 8

Windows 8 (Windows 8.x) is a version of Microsoft's Windows computer operating system. The final version for everyone was released everywhere on October 26, 2012. The president of the Windows Division, Steven Sinofsky, said: "With this system we shall make the biggest change from Windows 95", as they have removed the "Start" button and designed a new tile-based user interface to replace the "Start" menu (which first appeared in Windows 95).
Several versions of Windows 8 were made available to software developers well before the final release. The first of these, the Developer Preview, came out in September 2011. On February 29, 2012, Microsoft released a beta version of Windows 8.0 known as the Consumer Preview. Anyone could register online to download this version for free. After the Consumer Preview, a final preview named "Release Preview" was released on May 31, 2012. On October 26, 2012, Windows 8, as well as a version for devices using ARM processors, called Windows RT, both became available to the general public. On the same day, Microsoft also put new devices running Windows 8, including its newly-created Surface tablets up for sale in stores and online.
An update for Windows 8 with new features, such as the return of the "Start" button, was released on October 17, 2013 and is called Windows 8.1. During development, it was known as "Windows Blue", while the original version, Windows 8.0, was codenamed "Midori".
Windows 10 was developed to replace Windows 8 and 8.1, and came out on July 29, 2015. For the first year, users of Windows 8.1, as well as Windows 7, can get a free upgrade to this latest OS.
New features include a Windows Store where users can buy Metro style computer programs or download them for free. Windows To Go allows users to run the complete Windows system from a USB drive.
Windows 8 provides a new graphic user interface – Modern (also called Metro) UI (suitable for phone, tablet, notebook and classic PCs). This interface shows “tiles” which work as links and also as interactive widgets (RSS, weather, e-mails). Modern UI is optimized for touchscreen, but can be controlled by mouse and keyboard. Windows 8 still offers the classic desktop interface as an option.
Microsoft reworked the booting process, replacing classic BIOS with a new system called UEFI. This provides secure boot, which is protection against viruses.
Although Windows 8 is lighter than Windows 7, it demands more pixels on the screen. The minimum is 1366 x 768 pixels, which affects many users of laptops that have a maximum resolution of 1024 x 600 pixels. Some users with old hardware have for that reason continued to use windows 7. Windows 8 will work on resolutions lower than this, but some features will be unavailable.
File Explorer, formerly called Windows Explorer, has a new ribbon bar interface. It can pause and resume a file transfer, and has an improved method to resolve conflicts when two files have the same name.
In Windows 8 will enable logging in through face detection and voice control or especially hand gestures, using a camera.
Two months after Windows 8 was released, there were rumors that Microsoft were making a major update to be codenamed "Blue". In May 2013, Microsoft announced that "Windows Blue" was the codename for the forthcoming Windows 8.1.
On June 26 2013, Microsoft released build 9431 as the Windows 8.1 Preview, which could be downloaded.
On August 14 2013, Microsoft announced that Windows 8.1 would be released digitally on October 17 and released at retail and in new computers on October 18. It included greater customization and new bundled apps such as a calculator, sound recorder, and file manager.
In April 2014, Microsoft released an update for Windows 8.1 with improvements for keyboard and mouse users. The update pins the Windows Store on the task bar. Each modern app has a bar at the top, and can be closed the same way desktop apps are closed.

M25 motorway

The M25 motorway, or London Orbital, is a orbital motorway around Greater London.
The motorway was first suggested early in the 20th century, and a few sections were built in the early 1970s. The M25 was completed in 1986: is one of the world's longest orbital roads.
It is one of the busiest and most congested parts of the British motorway network. 196,000 vehicles were recorded in a single day near London Heathrow Airport. The M25 is a cruclial link between the four main London airports: Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton.
Bearing in mind that no motorways go through the centre of London, the M25 is a main route connecting north with south, and east with the west of England.
The motorway was originally built with only six lanes (three each way), despite research which suggested eight lanes were necessary. Now a fourth lane exists over most of the motorway, and more in special sections (see diagram). Plans were scaled back in 2009 in response to rising costs, but work is still going on.
Public enquiries continued through the 1970s and 1980s. Each section had its own enquiry, where local citizens and interest groups could question the plans. In all, "39 public inquiries before independent Inspectors were held, taking over 700 sitting days – with many more working days (and nights) preparing evidence". Objectors could put forward alternatives, and each of these had to be answered with presentation of evidence. Evidence included predictions of traffic and events which would affect growth of traffic. Enquiries and evidence were open to public scrutiny and debate.
Some enquiries lasted a day, and one one lasted 97 sitting days over 13 months. Proposals had to go before Parliament, and a special Act was needed to authorise the crossing of the northern tip of Epping Forest by the route in tunnel.
As predicted by research, soon after the motorway opened in 1986 traffic levels exceeded maximum designed capacity. In 1990 the Secretary of State for Transport announced plans to widen the whole of the M25 to four lanes. By 1993 the motorway that was designed for a maximum of 88,000 vehicles per day was carrying 200,000. 15% of UK motorway traffic volume was on the M25 and there were plans to add 6 lanes to the section from Junction 12 to 15 as well widening the rest of the motorway to 4 lanes.
In 1995 a contract was awarded to widen the section between junctions 8 and 10 from six to eight lanes for a cost of £93.4 million and a 'Motorway Incident Detection and Automatic Signalling' (MIDAS) system was introduced to the M25 from junction 10 to junction 15 at a cost of £13.5m in 1995 and then extended to junction 16 at a cost of £11.7m in 2002. This consists of a distributed network of traffic and weather sensors, speed cameras and variable-speed signs that control traffic speeds with little human supervision. The system has improved traffic flow slightly, and reduced the amount of start-stop driving. The use of variable speed limits makes this a "controlled motorway", and if hard shoulders are used at peak times it becomes a "managed motorway".
In 1995 there was a proposal to widen the section close to Heathrow Airport to 14 lanes. This attracted fierce opposition from road protesters opposing the Newbury Bypass and other schemes, and it was cancelled shortly afterwards. However, in 1997 the Department of Transport announced new proposals to widen the section from junction 12 (M3) and junction 15 (M4) to 12 lanes. At the Terminal Five public inquiry a Highways Agency official said that the widening was needed to accommodate traffic to the proposed new terminal, however the transport minister said that no such evidence had been given. Environmental groups objected to the decision to go ahead without holding a public inquiry. A decision to go-ahead was given for a 10-lane scheme in 1998, and the £148 million 'M25 Jct 12 to 15 Widening' contract was awarded to Balfour Beatty in 2003. The scheme was completed in 2005 as dual-five lane between junctions 12 to 14 and dual six lanes from 14 to 15.
The road cost £1 billion (in 1980s money) and took 11 years to build. It used two million tons of concrete and 3½ million tons of asphalt.
Traffic bottleneck at the Dartford Crossing in the east is the greatest problem on the motorway at present, even though the crossing is technically not part of the M25. At present the crossing is by bridge from the north, and by tunnel from the south. There are usually long tailbacks in both directions.
On its 25th birthday the BBC listed some of its effect on life near the capital:

Harold Urey

Harold Clayton Urey (April 29, 1893 – January 5, 1981) was an American physical chemist. His pioneering work on isotopes earned him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934. He played a significant role in the development of the atom bomb, and he had ideas on the development of organic life from non-living matter.
Urey earned a degree in zoology from the University of Montana and a Ph.D. in chemistry, studying thermodynamics under Gilbert N. Lewis at the University of California, Berkeley. 
At Berkeley, Urey was influenced by the work of physicist Raymond T. Birge and soon joined Niels Bohr in Copenhagen to work on atomic structure at the Institute for Theoretical Physics. 
On his return to the U.S. and between 1924 and 1928, he taught at The Johns Hopkins University as 'Associate in Chemistry', and then at Columbia where he assembled a team of associates. He wrote (with Arthur Ruark), "Atoms, quanta and molecules", one of the first English texts on quantum mechanics and its applications to atomic and molecular systems. 
He discovered deuterium, isolating it by repeatedly distilling a sample of liquid hydrogen. In 1931, he and his associates went on to demonstrate the existence of heavy water. Urey was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934 for this work.
During World War II, Urey's team at Columbia worked on a number of research programs that contributed towards the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb for the United States. Most importantly, they developed the gaseous diffusion method to separate uranium-235 from uranium-238. In autumn 1941, Urey, with G.B. Pegram, led a diplomatic mission to England to establish co-operation on the development of the atomic bomb.
Isaac Asimov, a student at Columbia at this time, remembers Urey lamenting, perhaps too strongly, how pained he was that he could do nothing to help the war effort. Asimov pointed out innocently that perhaps the enriched uranium kept at Columbia may have had something to do with the war effort. Urey reddened and changed the subject. Urey had worried about the German atomic bomb while working on uranium separation at Columbia during the war, and now referred to "the most dangerous situation that humanity has ever faced in all history".
After the war, Urey became professor of chemistry at the Institute for Nuclear Studies, then Ryerson professor of chemistry at the University of Chicago before moving to the University of California, San Diego. A UCSD building was named in his honor in the early 1960s, during a time when nearly all buildings other than student dormitories had only generic names. The name of the building is actually the "Frieda and Harold Urey Hall". Urey would have rejected the honor, he hated the architecture of the building, but since it also honored his wife he accepted.
In later life, Urey helped develop the field of 'cosmochemistry' and is credited with coining the term. His work on oxygen-18 led him to develop theories about the abundance of the chemical elements on Earth and of their abundance and evolution in the stars. This work was among the pioneering paleoclimatic research. Urey summarised his work in the book "The planets: their origin and development" (1952). Urey speculated that the early terrestrial atmosphere was probably composed of ammonia, methane and hydrogen; it was one of his Chicago graduate students, Stanley L. Miller, who showed that, if such a mixture be exposed to electric sparks and to water, it can interact to produce amino acids, commonly called the "building blocks of life" ("see Miller-Urey experiment").
Urey died at La Jolla, California, and is buried in the Fairfield Cemetery in DeKalb County, Indiana. While working at Columbia University, Urey was a resident of Leonia, New Jersey.

The Constituent Assembly of Pakistan was Pakistan's first parliament and first met on 10 August, 1947. The next day Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah (1876-1948), was elected as the President of the assembly and the new national flag was approved. On 14 August, 1947, Jinnah gave a speech which outlined the important principles of the future government of an independent Pakistan. Jinnah was chosen as the first Governor-General of Pakistan. The assembly's main task was to write a new constitution for Pakistan.
This was a difficult task, however the assembly did agree on the "Objective Resolution" on 12 March, 1949. A special committee of 24 members of the Constituent Assembly worked on a constitution based on the ideas in the Objective Resolution. The Governor-General, Ghulam Muhammad, shut down the assembly on 24 October 1954, before the draft constitution could be presented. The President of the Assembly, took legal action as he believed that shutting down the assembly was illegal. He lost the case in the Federal Court.
A second Constituent Assembly of Pakistan was formed on 28 May 1955. They wrote the new constitution which came into force on 23 March 1956.

Metric system

The metric system is a system of measurement with length based on the meter, mass or weight on the gram, and capacity (volume) based on the liter. This system is used around the world. It was developed in France and first introduced there in 1791, 2 years after the beheading of King Louis XVI. The metric units are based on decimal groups (multiples of ten). At first the metric system was based on two quantities: length and weight. The basic units were called the "metre" and the "gramme".
In 1866 the United States started to use the metric system, but it still is not the main US system of measurement. By 1875 many countries in Europe and in Latin America had changed to using the metric system. In 1875 seventeen countries signed the Metre Convention agreeing to share responsibility for defining and managing the metre and kilogram standards. The prototype copies of the metre and of the kilogram were called the "international prototype metre" and "international prototype kilogram". A new organization called the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) was set up. The international prototype metre and kilogram was kept at the BIPM headquarters. In 1960 the rules for the metric system was revised. The revised system was called the "International System of Units" (which is often written "SI" for short). The definition of SI also included rules for writing SI quantities. These rules are the same for all languages. In the 1970s many people in the United Kingdom and the rest of the Commonwealth started using the metric system at their places of work.
The metric system is a decimal-based system of measurement. The system has units of measure for each quantity. The names of most units of measure in the metric system have two parts. One part is the unit name and the other part is the prefix. For example, in the name "centimetre", the word "centi" is the prefix and the word "metre" is the unit name. Sometimes, as with metre, litre and gram, there is no prefix.
In the metric system, all units have a "symbol". Symbols are a shorthand way of writing the names of units. All the countries in the world use the same symbol for a unit, even though they might have different ways of writing out the unit name in full. For example
The metric system was first developed in France during the French Revolution. A French law passed in 1795 defined five units of measure. Three of these names are still in use today. They are the metre which is the unit of length, the gram which is the unit of mass and the litre which is the unit of volume. Since then many other units of measure have been developed and many definitions changed. The metric system now has units of measurement for energy, power, force, electric current, radioactivity and many others. The most commonly used units of measure in the metric system are listed below.
The definitions of the units are often being changed. In 1960 the definition of the metre was changed. Since then it has been defined in terms of the speed of light. At the current time (2014) it is proposed that the kilogram be redefined in terms of the Planck constant.
If the numbers are too big or too small, the metric system uses prefixes to make it easier to understand the numbers. 
milli
centi
kilo
There are a lot of other prefixes. Some of them are:
These tables will help you to estimate the size of different lengths or masses in the metric system. In these tables:
Some names in the metric system are spelt differently in British English and in American English.
In 1875 representatives from the governments of twenty different countries met in Paris to discuss weights and measures. Seventeen of the countries signed a treaty about weights and measures. The treaty was called "The Convention of the Metre". The countries that signed were: Argentine Confederation, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, United States and Venezuela. They agreed: 
The United Kingdom and the Netherlands went to the conference but did not sign the treaty at that time. After further consideration, the United Kingdom did sign the treaty in 1884 and the Netherlands became a member in 1929.
In 1889 the copies of the kilogram and the metre were ready to be given to the different countries that signed the treaty.
The United States Congress ratified the treaty in 1878. The United Kingdom signed the treaty 1884. Neither country passed laws making it compulsory to use the metric system.
In 1921 the Metre Convention was extended to include all physical measurements including time, electricity and temperature.
In 1960 the BIPM published the "International System of Units" (or SI). SI clarified a number of areas of the metric system, particularly in science and in engineering. The BIPM also standardized the way in which SI was written making it the same for all languages.
There are 16 US fluid ounces in a US pint but there are 20 imperial [UK] fluid ounces in an imperial pint. The US fluid ounce is larger than the imperial fluid ounce, but the imperial pint is larger than the US pint. In the 1700's this type situation was common across Europe. Each country measured length, weight/mass and volume in its own way. Sometimes different countries or cities used the same name for different measurements. Sometimes different cities in the same country had different ways of measuring things. In 1789 there were a quarter of a million different units of weight and measure in France.
During the French Revolution the French scientists decided that it would be better to have a new system of weights and measure. The system would be the same in all French provinces and cities. They also decided that it would easier if the new system used 10's instead of 12's, 16's or 20's. This is because people normally count in 10's. The new system became the official system of measurement in France in 1799. One of the French leaders, the Marquis de Condorcet declared that "[the metric system] is for all people for all time".
They decided that the new system would be for everybody on earth and that the new unit of length would be called a "metre". They decided to there would be 10,000,000 metres between the North Pole and the equator. Between 1791 and 1798 two surveyors, Pierre Méchain and Jean-Baptiste Delambre, measured the distance from Dunkirk to Barcelona using old French units. They used the stars to measure the latitude of these cities. They used this information to work out that the length of the metre should 443.296 "lignes". In 1798 the French scientists made a bar of platinum that was exactly one metre long. They stored this bar in the French archives. It was called the "metre des archives". People who made one metre rulers were able to check that their rulers were the same length as the "metre des archives". Other scientists made a kilogram weight from platinum which was also put in the archives. This weight was called the "kilogram des archives".
In 1799 the metric system was made compulsory, meaning people were made to use it by law, in the region around Paris. This caused a lot of confusion because the police enforced the new measures but customers preferred the old ones. So shopkeepers had to have both. People became worried the new measures were used to cheat them. Politicians tried to educate and convince people to use metric, but the people rejected the metric system. In 1800 the government tried to make the system acceptable by changing the names of the units back to the simpler names used before metrication. For example, the decimetre, centimetre, and millimetre were renamed to "palme" (hand), "doigt" (finger) and "trait" (trace).
In 1799 Napoleon became the leader of France. By 1812 he had conquered most of Europe. He introduced the metric system to the countries that he conquered. In 1815 he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo. After Napoleon was defeated, most of the countries started using their old systems of measurement again.
During this time, the metric system was still the official system of measurement in France. And it still had simplified unit names. But the French people continued to use the measures they were used to. The French government tried to persuade the people to convert. They mass-produced metric rulers, they tried to teach the people to use metric measures, and commanded the police to punish people who would not cooperate. Eventually the government stopped trying and withdrew the metric system.
On 12 February 1812, France stopped using the metric system and started using a new system called "mesures usuelles". The new system was based on many of the old pre-metric units. The old units were redefined to be round numbers or fractions of the withdrawn metric units. For example the "livre" (pound) was reintroduced and changed from 489 grams to 500 grams. The "toise" was redefined as 2 metres. The "toise" contained 6 "pied" (feet), changed from 324.8 mm to of a metre (333.33 mm). The "pied" had 12 "pouces" (inches) and the "pouce" had 12 "lignes".
In 1837 the metrication laws were revived in France. And in 1840, the system did become compulsory throughout France, almost 50 years after it was first introduced.
During the nineteenth century many small countries started cooperating with each other. In 1815 the Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed from seventeen small states. Each state had its own system of measurement. In 1820 they decided that it would be better if everybody used the metric system.
In 1815 the German Confederation was formed. It was an association of 39 different states. Each state had its own system of measurements. In 1834 the German Confederation formed a customs union called the "Zollverein". In 1851 the "Zollverein" decided to use metric units for trade between the various states. In 1871, most of the states in the German Confederation were joined together to form the German Empire. The German Empire continued to use the metric system. 
In the same year, Italy was also formed from a large number of small states. Italy also decided to use the metric system rather than choosing one of the old systems of measurement.
By 1875 many European and Latin American counties were already using the metric system. These countries included France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Peru and Columbia. Between 1875 and 1914 many more countries including Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Paraguay, Philippines and Vietnam started to use the metric system. In 1917, during the Bolshevik Revolution, the USSR (now Russia) adopted the metric system. By the start of the Second World War most non-English speaking countries had adopted the metric system.
In 1866, after most of the South American countries started to use the metric system, the United States passed a law that allowed people to use either the metric system or United States customary units for trade. Before 1893 the yard was defined as the length of the "standard yard" which was kept by the United States Treasury. The pound was defined as being the mass of the "standard pound". In 1893 the United States Congress passed the Mendenhall Order. This order defined the yard as being exactly metres and the pound as being exactly 0.4535924277 kilogram. The order only changed the definitions of the pound and the yard. It had no other effect on people's lives.
In 1975 the Metric Conversion Act started a formal metrication process. Metrication was to be voluntary. It was to be coordinated by the U.S. Metric Board. In 1988 the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act said that metric units had to be used for all federal projects. The Act did not apply to state projects. Some states demanded that metric units be used but other states did not. Some industries changed to using metric units but others did not. Soft drinks are sold in metric quantities. Milk is sold in customary units. Metric units are widely used in the design of motor cars. Aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner were designed using mainly customary units.
Some people in the United States want to complete the change-over to the metric system. They say that it will make things easier for everybody. Other people say that it will cost too much money.
Some people want to use the metric system because it will make it easier to export goods. Other people say that metrication can only work if all fifty states metricate at the same time. This will not happen unless the Federal Government takes the lead.
In 1897 the United Kingdom passed a law allowing people to use either the metric system or Imperial units for trade. By the late 1960s three quarters of British exports were to countries that used the metric system. However people in the United Kingdom still used imperial units. The Metrication Board was set up in 1969 to help Britain change to the metric system. Each company had to pay their own expenses. Some companies saved a lot of money by changing to the metric system because they could make the same goods for export as they made for sales in the United Kingdom. For example, almost all motor cars use metric-sized nuts and bolts. Other companies lost money because they had to make many changes but did not have any benefit from the changes. 
When the Metrication Board was closed down in 1981 most of government and industry had changed to the metric system but a lot of everyday things like road signs had not been changed. A survey taken in 2013 showed that metric units and imperial units were both widely used by British people in their private lives.

Woolly rhinoceros

The woolly rhinoceros ("Coelodonta antiquitatis") was a large mammal species of rhinoceros, now extinct. It was widespread throughout the tundra of northern Eurasia during the Pleistocene epoch, about 1.8 million years ago until about 10,000 years ago (the end of the last ice age). 
Recently, the earliest known woolly rhino fossil was discovered from 3.6 million years in the Himalayas on the cold Tibetan plateau. It lived there during a period of general climate warmth around the earth. It is believed that they migrated from there to other parts when the ice age developed.
It was well adapted to the cold; it had thick, shaggy fur, small ears, short legs, and a massive body (all to lessen heat loss). Fossils of this early rhino have been found, in addition to well-preserved corpses, which were found in frozen gravel in Siberia. Stone Age humans hunted woolly rhinos; they drew pictures of the rhinos on cave walls 30,000 years ago, giving us even more information about these large mammals.
