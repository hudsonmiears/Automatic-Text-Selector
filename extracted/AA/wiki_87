Fridtjof Nansen

Fridtjof Wedel-Jarlsberg Nansen (10 October 1861 – 13 May 1930) was a Norwegian explorer, historian, scientist, diplomat, humanitarian and a Nobel Peace Prize winner. 
In his youth a champion skier and ice skater, he led the team that made the first crossing of the Greenland interior in 1888, and won international fame after reaching a record northern latitude of 86°14′ during his North Pole expedition of 1893–96. Although he retired from exploration after his return to Norway, his techniques of polar travel and his innovations in equipment and clothing influenced a generation of subsequent Arctic and Antarctic expeditions. 
Nansen studied zoology at the Royal Frederick University, and later worked as a curator at the Bergen Museum where his research on the central nervous system of lower marine creatures earned him a doctorate and helped establish modern theories of neurology. After 1896 his main scientific interest switched to oceanography; in the course of his research he made many scientific cruises, mainly in the North Atlantic, and contributed to the development of modern oceanographic equipment. As one of his country's leading citizens, in 1905 Nansen spoke out for the ending of Norway's union with Sweden, and was instrumental in persuading Prince Charles of Denmark to accept the throne of the newly independent Norway. Between 1906 and 1908 he served as the Norwegian representative in London, where he helped negotiate the Integrity Treaty that guaranteed Norway's independent status.
In the final decade of his life Nansen devoted himself primarily to the League of Nations, following his appointment in 1921 as the League's High Commissioner for Refugees. In 1922 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on behalf of the displaced victims of the First World War and related conflicts. Among the initiatives he introduced was the "Nansen passport" for stateless persons, a certificate recognised by more than 50 countries. 
He worked on behalf of refugees until his sudden death from a heart attack in 1930, after which the League established the Nansen International Office for Refugees to ensure that his work continued. This office received the Nobel Peace Prize for 1938. Nansen was honoured by many nations, and his name is commemorated in numerous geographical features, particularly in the polar regions.

Joubert syndrome

Joubert syndrome is a genetic birth defect. The cerebellum of people with the disorder is not developed normally. The disorder does not occur very often. Since its first description in 1969, a few hundred cases have been described. It is a ciliopathy. 
Mutations at 21 different loci have been found to cause Joubert syndrome. 
Research has shown that a number of genetic disorders may be related as to their root cause. Joubert syndrome is one such disease. It is a member of a class of diseases called ciliopathies.
The underlying cause of the ciliopathies may be defects in the mechanism of cilia in the cell. Cilia are organelles which are present in many cell types in the body. The cilia defects damage "critical developmental signaling pathways" essential to cell development. This explains the multi-symptom nature of many syndromes and diseases.
Currently about nine ciliopathies are known, including Joubert syndrome.

He later died at the hospital.
People started getting angry. They came to Anna Drive and started protesting. Soon most of east Anaheim was fighting police. Trash cans were burnt while people went crazy and broke shop windows. The fourth night was the most violent. Police had to shoot people with fake bullets. Two reporters were hurt.
The mayor had the FBI look at the shooting carefully. Another man, Joel Acevedo, was shot the next day and died too, making it the sixth deadly police shooting in one year.

Mast cell

A mast cell is like a white blood cell (leukocyte) which lives and acts in tissues. It is made in bone marrow, and matures in tissues, where it defends against parasites.
Mast cells have many granules rich in histamine and heparin. Mast cells play an important protective role in wound healing and defence against pathogens. They are a part cause of allergy and anaphylaxis, 
The mast cell is very similar in both appearance and function to the basophil, a type of white blood cell. However, they are not the same. 
Mast cells were first described by Paul Ehrlich in his 1878 doctoral thesis. He noted the large granules visible once they were stained. They are now considered to be part of the immune system.

A total of 113 athletes, 63 men and 50 women, competed in 17 sports, although two other athletes played as team reserves. Handball was the only sport in a team in which Denmark took part in these Olympic games.
The Danish team included several past Olympic champions, one of them defending (the men's lightweight coxless fours team, led by veteran rowers Eskild Ebbesen and Morten Jørgensen). Notable athletes featured tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, and swimmer Lotte Friis, who won the bronze medal in Beijing. Kim Wraae Knudsen, silver medalist in the men's sprint kayak doubles in Beijing, was the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony.
Team Danmark and the Danish Sports' Union ("Dansk Idræts-Forbund", DIF) set a goal of eight medals to be targeted in the medal standings. Team Danmark and DIF also believed Denmark had the best chances of winning a medal in wrestling, shooting, cycling, handball, the equestrian events, rowing, athletics, badminton and sailing.

Chain rule

The chain rule is a way of finding the derivative of a function. It is used where the function is in another function. This is called a composite function. 
If F(x) equals two functions that we can take a derivative of, such as:
then the derivative, F prime, is
1. Find the derivative of the outside function (all of it at once).
2. Find the derivative of the inside function (the bit between the brackets).
3. Multiply the answer from the first step by the answer from the second step. This is basically the last step in solving for the derivative of a function.
In this example, the cubed sign () is the outside function and formula_7 is the inside function. The derivative of the outside function would be formula_8, where the inside function is plugged in for x. The derivative of the inside function would be 2x, which is multiplied by formula_9 to get formula_10.

The Russet Sparrow, also called the cinnamon sparrow or cinnamon tree sparrow, is a bird that is part of the sparrow family. It is a small bird with a thick beak. The russet sparrow is 14 to 15 centimeters long. Its feathers are mainly rufous (reddish-brown) above and grey below. Its sounds are made up of short chirps. These chirps are put together to form a song. There are 3 subspecies of the russet sparrow, "rutilans" (the main species), "intensior", which, along with the main species, lives in parts of eastern Asia and "cinnamomeus", which lives in the Himalayas and is commonly seen around areas of terrace cultivation. The sparrow mainly eats seeds from herbs and grains. The russet sparrow is the common sparrow of towns and cities where the house sparrow is not present.

Oscar II of Sweden

Oscar II (21 January 1829 – 8 December 1907), baptised Oscar Fredrik, was King of Sweden from 1872 until his death and King of Norway from 1872 until 1905. The third son of King Oscar I of Sweden and Josephine of Leuchtenberg, he was a descendant of Gustav I of Sweden through his mother.
When he was born on January 21, 1829 in Stockholm, Oscar Fredrik was created Duke of Östergötland. He entered the navy at the age of eleven, and was appointed junior lieutenant in July 1845. Later he studied at Uppsala University, where he distinguished himself in mathematics. On 13 December 1848, he was made an honorary member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
From 1859, when his father died, he was first in line to the Swedish throne after his oldest brother King Charles, who then had no male heirs (his son had died in infancy in 1854). His middle brother Gustaf had died in 1852.
He succeeded his brother Charles XV and IV on 18 September 1872, and was crowned as king of Norway in the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim on 18 July 1873. At the accession he adopted as his motto "Brödrafolkens väl" / "Broderfolkenes Vel" ("The Welfare of the Brother Peoples"). While the King and the Royal Court resided mostly in Sweden, Oscar made the effort of learning to be fluent in Norwegian and from the very beginning he realized the essential difficulties in the maintenance of the union between the two countries.
The political events which led up to the peaceful dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 could hardly have been attained but for the tact and patience of the king himself. He was dethroned on 7 June 1905 by the Norwegian Parliament and renounced the Norwegian throne on 26 October. 
On 6 June 1857 he married in Wiesbaden-Biebrich, Germany, Princess Sophia Wilhelmina, youngest daughter of Duke William of Nassau. 
His health declined, indeed, to permit any prince of his house to become king of Norway, but better relations between the two countries were restored before his death in Stockholm on 8 December 1907 from unknown causes.

Gumbel distribution

The Gumbel distribution is a probability distribution of extreme values.
In probability theory and statistics, the Gumbel distribution is used to model the distribution of the maximum (or the minimum) of a number of samples of various distributions. 
Such a distribution might be used to represent the distribution of the maximum level of a river in a particular year if there was a list of maximum values for the past ten years. It is also useful in predicting the chance that an extreme earthquake, flood or other natural disaster will occur. 
The Gumbel distribution is a continuous probability distribution. Gumbel distributions are a family of distributions of the same general form. These distributions differ in their "location" and "scale" parameters: the mean ("average") of the distribution defines its location, and the standard deviation ("variability") defines the scale.
One recognizes the Gumbel "probability density function" (PDF) and the Gumbel "cumulative distribution function" (CDF).
In the PDF, the probability P of a value V to occur between limits A and B, briefly written as P(A<VP(V \leq A) = CDF(A) </math>.
The mathematical expression of the CDF is:
where μ is the "mode" (the value where the probability density function reaches its peak), "e" is a mathematical constant, about 2.718, and β is a value related to the "standard deviation" (σ) :
where π is the Greek symbol for Pi whose value is close to 22/7 or 3.142, and the symbol formula_3 stands for the square root.
The "mode" μ can be found from the "median" M, being the value of A where CDF(A)=0.5, and β:
where "ln" is the natural logarithm.
The "mean", E(x), given by:
where formula_6 = "Euler constant" formula_7 0.5772.
In a data series, the parameters "mode" (μ) and β can be estimated from the average, median and standard deviation. The calculation of the last three quantities is explained in the respective Wiki pages. Then, with the help of formulas given in the previous section, the factors μ and β can be calculated. In this way, the CDF of the Gumbel distribution belonging to the data can be determined and the probability of interesting data values can be found.
In hydrology, the Gumbel distribution is used to analyze such variables as monthly and annual maximum values of daily rainfall and river discharge volumes, and also to describe droughts.
The blue picture illustrates an example of fitting the Gumbel distribution to ranked maximum one-day October rainfalls showing also the 90% "confidence belt" based on the binomial distribution.

Lipid bilayer

Lipid bilayers are important in biological cells. They are the basis of cell membranes, and they surround most cell organelles. Lipid bilayers form automatically from phospholipids by self-assembly.
The phospholipids have heads which mix with water and tails which reject water. So the tails come together in the centre of the double layer, and the heads on the outside are surrounded by water. 
The lipid bilayers stop most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules passing through. They also stop most ions.
In cells, proteins are put in the bilayer by enzymes. The proteins decide which molecules come in and which go out of the cell. For example, cells control salt concentrations and pH by pumping ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.

Mycobacterium

Mycobacterium is a genus of bacteria, with about 100 species.The genus includes pathogens known to cause serious diseases in mammals, including tuberculosis ("Mycobacterium tuberculosis") and leprosy ("Mycobacterium leprae"). 
Mycobacteria can colonize their hosts without the hosts showing any adverse signs. Many people around the world have infections of "M. tuberculosis" without showing any signs of it.
Mycobacterial infections are difficult to treat. The organisms are tough due to their cell wall. In addition, they are naturally resistant to a number of antibiotics that disrupt cell-wall building, such as penicillin. With their unique cell wall, they can survive long exposure to acids, alkalis, detergents, oxidative bursts, lysis by complement, and many antibiotics. 
Most mycobacteria are susceptible to the antibiotics clarithromycin and rifamycin, but antibiotic-resistant strains have emerged.
The Greek prefix "myco" means "fungus". When they are cultured on the surface of liquids, mycobacteria growth is similar to that of moulds, a kind of fungus.

<doc id="366243" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=366243" title="Thutmose II">
Thutmose II

Thutmose II (sometimes "Thutmosis", or "Tuthmosis II", which means "Born of Thoth") was the fourth Pharaoh of the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt. He built some small monuments and began two small military campaigns but did little else during his rule and was probably strongly influenced by his wife, Hatshepsut. He ruled from 1493 BC to 1479 BC. Thutmose II's body was found in the Deir el-Bahri Cache above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut with many other pharaohs. It can be viewed today in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Thutmose II was the son of Thutmose I and a minor wife, Mutnofret. He may married his fully royal half-sister, Hatshepsut, in order to secure his kingship. His armies stopped rebellions in Nubia and the Levant and defeated a group of nomadic Bedouins. But these campaigns were led by the king's Generals, and not by Thutmose II himself. This is often seen as evidence that Thutmose II was still a child at his when he became king. Thutmose II fathered Neferure with Hatshepsut, and a male heir, the famous Thutmose III, by a lesser wife named Iset before his death.
Some archaeologists believe that Hatshepsut was the real power behind the throne during Thutmose II’s rule. Domestic and foreign policies were similar and she claimed that her father wanted them to rule together. She is pictured in several scenes from a Karnak gateway dating to Thutmose II's reign, both together with her husband and alone. She later had herself crowned Pharaoh several years into the rule of her husband's young successor Thutmose III. "The queen's agents actually replaced the boy king's name in a few places with her own cartouches" on the gateway.
The ancient historian Manetho wrote that Thutmose II ruled for 13 years. This figure is highly disputed among scholars. Some modern historians believe he ruled for only three years.
Most pharaohs are remembered because of the number of monuments and buildings they created. However Hatsehput had his name removed replaced with her own. Thutmose III had Thutmose II's name added to all kinds of monuments. This makes it hard for people studying Thutmose II to know what he really created.
There are several surviving buildings built for the king at Semna, Kumma, and Elephantine. His biggest monument was a limestone gateway at Karnak that was once at the front of the Fourth Pylon's forecourt. But this monument was not completed in Thutmose II's reign but in the reign of his son Thutmose III. This suggests that Thutmose II did not rule for very long. The gateway was later pulled down and its building blocks used for the foundation of the Third Pylon by Amenhotep III.
When Thutmose II became king, there was a rebellion by the Kush. The Egyptians retreated into the fort built by Thutmose I. Thutmose II was too young for battle, but he sent an army into Nubia. The rebellion was easily crushed with the help of his father's military generals. 
Thutmose also seems to have fought against the Shasu Bedouin in the Sinai. This was a minor raid, but the army went as far as Upper Retenu, or Syria. This quite possibly indicates that the raid against the Shasu was only fought on the way to Syria.
Thutmose II's mummy was discovered in the Deir el-Bahri cache, in 1881. He was in a tomb with other 18th and 19th kings including Ahmose I, Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Thutmose III, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses IX.
The mummy was unwrapped by Gaston Maspero on July 1, 1886. The face and shape of the head was very similar to the mummy of Thutmose I, his likely father. The body of Thutmose II been badly damaged by ancient tomb robbers. His left arm was broken off at the shoulder-joint, the forearm separated at the elbow joint, and his right arm chopped off below the elbow. His abdomen and much of his chest looked as if it had been hacked with an axe. His right leg had been cut from his body. All of these injuries had taken place after his death. The body also showed signs that Thutmose II did not have an easy life:

Mantoux test

The Mantoux test is a test developed to detect tuberculosis. In the year 1890, Robert Koch developed tuberculin, as a treatment for tuberculosis. The substance proved ineffective to treat the disease, today it is commonly used to detect it, though. Tuberculin is a substance based on the pathogen that causes tuberculosis. Charles Mantoux, a French physician, developed a test method, based on the work of Koch. 
A positive test result simply says that the immune system came in contact with Mycobacteria - this does not necessarily mean that people with a positive test result have been infected with tuberculosis. Such a result, which shows as positive, even though the outcome should be negative is called "false positive". 
The test shows the reaction of the immune system to tuberculin. This requires an intact immune system: People whose immune system is weakened, for example those with a HIV infection, may also show a "false negative": Their immune system may simply be too weak to react. Similarly, the use of certain substances, such as steroids may lead to false negatives.

Mobutu Sese Seko

Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu wa Za Banga (born Joseph-Desiré Mobutu; 14 October 1930 – 7 September 1997) () was the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country was known as Zaire for much of his rule.
Mobutu is commonly known as Mobutu or Mobutu Sese Seko. While in office, he formed an authoritarian regime, amassed vast personal wealth, and attempted to purge the country of all colonial cultural influence. He was an anti-communist.
During the Congo Crisis, Mobutu led a coup against the nationalist government of Patrice Lumumba. He wanted to take control of the government of Congo-Léopoldville. He soon became the army chief of staff. In 1965 he led a second coup to be Prime Minister. Then in 1967 he established a presidential form of government headed by himself. As part of his program of “national authenticity,” Mobutu changed the Congo's name to Zaïre in 1971. He changed his own name to Mobutu Sese Seko in 1972. Mobutu established a one-party state and a cult of personality. 
During his reign, Mobutu built a highly centralized state. He amassed a large personal fortune through economic exploitation and corruption. Because of this some people called his rule “kleptocracy.” The nation suffered from uncontrolled inflation, a large debt, and massive currency devaluations. By 1991 economic deterioration and unrest led him to agree to share power with opposition leaders. He used the army to stop this change. In May 1997 rebel forces, led by Laurent Kabila, removed him from the country. 
Mobutu Sese Seko is notorious for the corruption, nepotism, and embezzlement of billions of dollars that took place during his reign. He also had extravagances such as Concorde-flown shopping trips to Paris. Mobutu presided over the country for some four decades, despite many reports of abuses and human-rights violations. As such, many have described him as the "archetypal African dictator".
Mobutu died in 1997 of prostate cancer in Morocco.

Polio vaccine

Two polio vaccines are used throughout the world against poliomyelitis (or polio).
The first was developed by Jonas Salk and first tested in 1952. Announced to the world by Salk on April 12, 1955, it is an injection of inactivated (dead) poliovirus. An oral vaccine was developed by Albert Sabin using attenuated poliovirus. Human trials of Sabin's vaccine began in 1957 and it was licensed in 1962. 
There is no long term carrier for poliovirus, and polioviruses have no non-primate reservoir in nature. The virus cannot survive in the open environment for a long time. Therefore, interruption of person to person transmission of the virus by vaccination is the key step in removing polio entirely. The two vaccines have eliminated polio from most countries in the world. Polio worldwide has dropped from about 350,000 cases in 1988 to 1,652 cases in 2007.

Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (August 8, 1605 – November 30, 1675), was a member of the English nobility who started the colony of Maryland in the British colonies. He was the first Proprietary Governor of the Province of Maryland. Before that, he was the ninth Proprietary Governor of the Colony of Newfoundland (in what is today Canada). His father was George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore. George Calvert was supposed to be the proprietary governor of both Maryland and Newfoundland, but he died before he could take the position. 
He was called "Cecil Calvert." Cecil was a Roman Catholic and the colony of Maryland was officially Catholic. He managed Maryland from his home in England. Maryland was known for its religious tolerance. At the time, there was a lot of religious persecution in England. Many Catholics fled (ran away to) Maryland because their religion was accepted there. Calvert was governor of Maryland for forty-two years. He died in England on November 30, 1675, aged 70 years. The city of Baltimore is named for him.

Tchoukball

Tchoukball is an indoor team sport. It was created in the 1970s by Swiss biologist Hermann Brandt. Brandt believed that "The objective of all physical activities is not to make champions, but make a contribution to building a harmonious society". His wanted to create a team sport which did not involve the injuries which he saw as being a problem in other sports.
The sport is usually played on an indoor court that is by }. At each end, there is a 'frame' (a device similar to a trampoline off which the ball bounces). This frame measures . There is also a semicircular D-shaped area measuring in radius around the frame which players can not enter. The game is played with two teams of 12 players on each team. Of the twelve players on a team, seven may be on the court at any one time. Each team can score on both ends on the field. In order to score a point, the ball must be thrown by an attacking player, hit the frame and bounce outside the 'D' without being caught by the defending team. Physical contact is not allowed. Also, and defenders may not try to stop the attacking team's passes. Players may take three steps with the ball and can hold the ball for at most three seconds. Teams may not pass the ball more than three times before shooting at the frame.
Tchoukball has become an international sport. It is played in Brazil, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Great Britain, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Macau, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United States. It is governed by the Féderation Internationale de Tchoukball (FITB, founded in 1971). Taiwan hosted the 2004 World Championships and won both the women's and junior championships. The Swiss won the men's championship. The 2006, European Championships were held in Switzerland. Great Britain won both the Men's and Under-18's titles. Switzerland won the Ladies event.

Mirage

A mirage is an image that is distorted by the atmosphere so that its form and location can look very different from the actual object. It is caused by the way light bends as it passes through layers of air of different temperatures.
The words "mirage" and "mirror" come from the same root word, which means "to look at."
Normally, light travels in a straight line, but it will change direction depending on what it passes through. This bending is called "refraction." Gases, such as air, become thinner as they get warmer. As a result, light tends to curve (or refract) towards the colder layer of air. This makes the image appear to come from a different direction than the original object.
There are two basic types of mirage, depending on which direction the temperature changes, inferior and superior.
An inferior mirage is arguably the most common type seen over land. Air near solid ground is typically warmer than the air above it. When light from the sky passes through it, a shimmering, fragmented image of the sky may appear to come from the ground, resembling water.
Sometimes a mirage can appear to come from higher up than the original object. When the colder air is lower (called an inversion layer), as it often is over large bodies of water or ice, the apparent direction of the mirage will be opposite that of an inferior mirage. For example, the distorted image of a ship or an island may appear on or above the surface, even if the original object is hidden below the horizon.
A "Fata Morgana" is a complex superior mirage whose appearance can change quickly and dramatically. Its name refers to Morgan le Fay, a mythical enchantress strongly associated with Arthurian legends. In times past, the disturbing images seen as part of the mirage were attributed to illusions created by magic.
A mirage-like effect can be achieved by allowing a soluble substance like sugar or salt to slowly dissolve in a deep container of water, so that there is more sugar in the water near the bottom than in the water above it. This can refract the image of an object seen through it in a similar manner as a superior mirage often seen over open water.

Titus Salt

Sir Titus Salt, first baronet (20 September 1803 – 29 December 1876), was born in Morley near Leeds. He was a manufacturer, politician and a phillanthropist in Bradford, West Yorkshire. 
His father Daniel Salt was a dry salter and then he decided to become a farmer. His mother died when he was quite young. Titus Salt had 11 children. 
After working as a woolen stapler for two years at a mill near Wakefield he became his fathers business partner-Daniel Salt and son. The company used Russian Donskio wool, which was widely used in the woollens trade, but not in worsted cloth. Titus visited the millers in Bradford.
After working for two years as a wool-stapler in Wakefield he became his father's partner in the business of Daniel Salt and Son. He set up as a spinner and manufacturer.
In 1836, Titus came upon some bales of Alpaca wool in a warehouse in Liverpool and, after taking some samples away to experiment, came back and bought the consignment. Though he was not the first in England to work with the fibre, he was the creator of the lustrous and subsequently fashionable cloth called 'alpaca'. (The discovery was described by Charles Dickens in slightly fictionalised form in "Household Words").
In 1833 he took over his father's business and within twenty years had expanded it to be the largest employer in Bradford. In 1848 Titus Salt became mayor of Bradford. Smoke and pollution came from mills and factory chimneys. Salt tried unsuccessfully to clean up the pollution using a device called the Rodda Smoke Burner.
Around 1850, he decided to build a mill large enough to consolidate his textile manufacture in one place, but he "did not like to be a party to increasing that already over-crowded borough". So he bought land three miles from the town in Shipley next to the River Aire, the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the Midland Railway and began building in 1851. He opened it with a grand banquet on his 50th birthday, 20 September 1853, and set about building houses, bathhouses, an institute, hospital, almshouses and churches, that make up the model village of Saltaire. He built the Congregational Church which is now Saltaire United Reformed Church, at his own expense in 1858–59, and donated the land on which the Wesleyan Chapel was built.

Insei

, also known as "cloistered rule," is an ancient Japanese term which means a special form of Imperial government. 
In the "Insei" system, the monarch abdicated or retired and a new emperor was named; however, the old emperor held on to significant power and influence in the court and in the nation. The emperors who withdrew from public life did not give up any of their many powers. In practice, the retired emperor only gave up the time-consuming burden of his ceremonial roles and formal duties.
There were emperors who abdicated before and after the Heian period; however, the term "Insei" is most often used to mean the kind of Imperial system put in place by Emperor Shirakawa in 1086. This system was very important in the years before the rise of the Kamakura shogunate in 1192. 
The succession of power in the "Insei" system was complex.
The last retired emperor with an "Insei" title was Emperor Reigen in the Edo period.

Fingerspelling is making an alphabet with your hands. Many deaf people learn fingerspelling. They use it when they want to sign a word but there is no sign in the sign language, or when they don't understand what the sign means. Other people also use fingerspelling to talk in secret, to help remember something, or to talk without making sound (for example in a church).
Fingerspelling is a part of some sign languages. Writing systems are not the same everywhere, and fingerspelling is also different. Different countries have different ways of fingerspelling. Some alphabets use one hand, some use two hands.

<doc id="366401" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=366401" title="Siege of Sidney Street">
Siege of Sidney Street

The Siege of Sidney Street, or the "Battle of Stepney", was a notorious gunfight in London's East End on 3 January 1911. 
It happened after a jewellery robbery went bad two weeks before. Three policemen had been killed, and others wounded, and one of the gang was also killed. This event is known as the Houndsditch murders.
The gang were said to be international anarchists led by Peter Piatkow, a.k.a. "Peter the Painter". It is still not clear who their leader actually was.
The end took place at a house in Sidney Street, where word came that a gang of foreigners had moved in. In the fire that ended the siege, one fireman and two robbers died. The fates of other members of the gang, and its leader, are not known.
On 16 December 1910, a gang of Jewish immigrants attempted to break into the rear of a jeweller's shop at 119 Houndsditch. A nextdoor shopkeeper heard their hammering, and told the City of London Police (in whose area the shop was). Nine unarmed officers — three sergeants and six constables (two in plain clothes) — moved towards the jewellers.
Sergeants Bentley and Bryant knocked at the door of No. 11 Exchange Buildings, behind the jeweller's shop. The gang's leader, George Gardstein, opened the door, but when he did not answer their questions they assumed he did not understand English and told him to fetch someone who did. Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared.
The house had a single ground-floor room, into which the front door directly opened, with a staircase leading to the upper floors on the left, and a door to the open yard at the back on the right. 
Growing impatient, the two sergeants entered the house to find the room apparently empty, before they became aware of a man standing in the darkness at the top of the stairs. After a short conversation, another man entered through the yard door, rapidly firing a pistol, while the man on the stairs also started shooting.
Both officers were hit, with Bentley collapsing across the doorstep, while Bryant managed to stagger outside. In the street, Constable Woodhams ran to help Bentley, but was himself wounded by one of the gang firing from the cover of the house, as was Sergeant Tucker, who died almost instantly.
The gang then attempted to break out of the cul-de-sac, Gardstein being grabbed by Constable Choate almost at the entrance. In the struggle Choate was wounded several times by Gardstein, before being shot five more times by other members of the gang, who also managed to hit Gardstein in the back. They then dragged Gardstein ¾ of a mile to 59 Grove Street, where he died the next day. Constable Choate and Sergeant Bentley died in separate hospitals the same day. An intense search followed, and a number of the gang or their associates were soon arrested.
On 2 January 1911, an informer told police that two or three members of the gang, possibly including Peter the Painter, were hiding at 100 Sidney Street, Stepney. The police were worried the suspects were about to flee, but expected heavy resistance to any attempt to capture them. On 3 January, two hundred police officers cordoned off the area and the siege began. At dawn the battle started.
The defenders, though heavily outnumbered, had better guns and stores of ammunition. The Tower of London was called for backup, and word got to the Home Secretary, Winston Churchill. Churchill arrived on the spot to see the situation at first hand, and to offer advice. Churchill authorised calling in a detachment of Scots Guards to assist the police. 
Six hours into the battle, and just as the field artillery piece that Churchill had authorised arrived, a fire began in the building. When the fire brigade arrived, Churchill refused them access to the building. The police stood ready, guns aimed at the front door, waiting for the men inside to attempt their escape. The door never opened. Instead, the remains of two members of the gang, Fritz Svaars and William Sokolow (both were also known by numerous aliases), were later discovered inside the building. 
No sign of Peter the Painter was found. Besides the three policemen, a London firefighter also died of his injuries.

The city is along the coast where the flows into the Pacific Ocean. It is connected to Morioka by an east-west train line and highway and the coastal highway also goes through the town. The city has a port but much of the shipping traffic is taken by larger cities along the coast.
On June 6, 2005, the old Miyako absorbed the town of Tarō and village of Niisato from Shimohei District to form the new city of Miyako, more than doubling the old city's size. As of 2008, the new city had an estimated population of 57,874 and a density of 83.1 persons per km². The total area is 696.82 km².
On January 1, 2010, the city absorbed another Shimohei District village, Kawai.
On March 11, 2011, the city was devastated by a tsunami caused by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake.
At least 401 lives were lost.
Only about 30–60 boats survived from the town's 960 ship fishing fleet. A study by the University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute found that the waters had reached at least above sea level. This was almost as high the record of the 1896 Meiji-Sanriku earthquake tsunami.
Some of the most well known scenes of the 2011 Japanese tsunami, broadcast worldwide, were shot in Miyako. It shows a dark black wave cresting and overflowing a floodwall and tossing cars, followed by a fishing boat capsizing as it hit the floodwall and then crushed as it was forced under a bridge.

Winfield Scott

Winfield Scott (June 13, 1786 – May 29, 1866) was a United States Army general, and unsuccessful presidential candidate of the Whig Party in 1852.
A national hero after the Mexican-American War, he served as military governor of Mexico City. Such was his stature that, in 1852, the United States Whig Party passed over its own incumbent President of the United States, Millard Fillmore, to nominate Scott in that year's United States presidential election. Scott lost to Democrat Franklin Pierce in the general election, but remained a popular national figure, receiving a brevet promotion in 1856 to the rank of lieutenant general, becoming the first American since George Washington to hold that rank.
Scott was born to William Scott and Anna Mason in Dinwiddie County, Virginia, near Petersburg, Virginia, on June 13, 1786. He briefly attended College of William and Mary, studied law in the office of a private attorney, and served as a Virginia militia cavalry corporal near Petersburg in 1807.
Scott was married to Lucy Baker from 1812 until her death in 1816. They had one son. Then he was married to Maria De Hart Mayo from 1817 until her death in 1862. They had six children.
He died in West Point, New York on May 29, 1866 from unknown causes, aged 79. He is buried in West Point Cemetery.
The saying "Great Scott" was named after his last name.

Vaporizer (cannabis)

A vaporizer or vapouriser is a device used to extract the active ingredients of plant material so that they can be breathed. It is often used for cannabis, tobacco, or other herbs such as chamomile.
Vaporization is an alternative to smoking. It doesn't make smoke or other cancer-causing by-products. It does that by heating the material so that the active compounds boil into a vapor. Nothing actually burns, so there is no smoke or taste of smoke. Vapor ideally contains almost no particulate matter or tar, and much less noxious gas such as carbon monoxide. The vapor can be collected in a jar or inflatable bag, or inhaled directly.
Vaporizers are sometimes used by chefs. They use them to heat herbs and spices to release flavors that are otherwise difficult to extract, or that might be spoiled by overheating during cooking. Chicago's Achatz uses the aroma-filled bags as place-mats, punctured when plates are placed in front of the customer.

Sirimavo Bandaranaike

Sirimavo Ratwatte Dias Bandaranaike (17 April 1916 – 10 October 2000) was a Sri Lankan politician. She served as prime minister three times and was the leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. She was the first female to be elected head of government in the world. Bandaranaike was the widow of a previous prime minister, Solomon Bandaranaike, who was murdered in 1959. Her policies were based in socialism and similar to her husband's. All three of their children later served in the Sri Lankan government.
She spent 40 years in political office. She resigned on 10 August 2000. Exactly two months later she died, aged 84, of a heart attack.
Sirimavo Bandaranaike was born on 17 April 1916, as Sirimavo Ratwatte. Her family was part of the aristocracy. She was a Buddhist, but went to school at a convent in Colombo, where she was taught by Roman Catholic nuns. In 1940, she married Solomon Bandaranaike, who was a member of parliament at the time. He became prime minister in 1956 as the leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), eight years after Sri Lanka's became independent from Britain. Sirimavo and Solomon had three children, Chandrika, Sunethra and Anura.
Sirimavo did not form a career in politics until her husband was shot dead on 26 September 1959. She was named successor to her husband's leadership of the party. She led that party to win elections in July 1960, promising to continue her husband's policies. Bandaranaike became Prime Minister on 21 July 1960. She was the first female prime minister in the world, and the first woman to be elected head of government. 
Bandaranaike was a socialist. She continued her husband's policies of nationalising major sectors of the economy. She also brought all schools that were owned by the Roman Catholic Church under the government's control. The most famous of her early policies was the Sinhala Only Act, also started by her husband but never finished. This included a plan to Tamil residents to India (get them Indian citizenship and deport them). It also made Sinhala the state's only official language by removing English. This was seen as discriminatory and was the beginning of human rights protests and Tamil militancy.
The government's takeover of foreign businesses, particularly petroleum companies, upset Britain and the United States, who both ended aid to Sri Lanka. As a result, Bandaranaike made a closer relationship with China and the Soviet Union. In 1962, Christian officers of the military made an unsuccessful attempt at a coup d'état. Bandaranaike lost a vote of confidence in 1964, and her party was defeated in the resulting elections in 1965. Before she was replaced, Bandaranaike's government signed an agreement with India over the status of about one million Tamils: 600,000 were to be granted Indian citizenship and repatriated, and 375,000 were to be granted Sri Lankan citizenship.
Bandaranaike became prime minister again in the 1970 elections. She led a coalition of three parties. Just over a year later, another group tried a coup d'état and created a brief insurgency. The government was saved by military aid from India and Pakistan.
A new constitution was introduced in 1972. The monarchy was abolished, and the Commonwealth realm known as Ceylon was replaced by the modern republic of Sri Lanka. The President of Sri Lanka replaced Queen Elizabeth II as head of state.
During her second term, Bandaranaike became more and more intolerant of criticism. She forced critical media outlets to shut down. She also nationalised the country's largest newspaper, "Lake House". Bandaranaike was chosen chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1976. Despite success in foreign affairs, she was losing popular support in Sri Lanka very quickly. Her government was accused of corruption while the economy was quickly declining. Elections were scheduled to be held in 1975, but Bandaranaike used a clause of the new constitution to delay them indefinitely. The elections took place in 1977, and her party was defeated severely. In 1980, Bandaranaike was charged with abusing her power for delaying the elections. She was forced out of her seat in parliament and banned from public office for seven years.
Bandaranaike stayed as leader of the SLFP despite losing every general election in the next ten years. Her party led a coalition (the People's Alliance) to win the general elections in 1994. Bandaranaike's daughter, Chandrika, became prime minister, and was then elected president the same year. Bandaranaike became prime minister again, but the constitution had changed since her last term. As prime minister she was now subordinate to her daughter, the President. She stayed in office until a few months before her death, but had little real power. She resigned on 10 August 2000. Exactly two months later she died, aged 84, of a heart attack.

<doc id="366488" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=366488" title="Protein folding">
Protein folding

Protein folding is the process by which a protein gets its functional shape or 'conformation'. It is mainly a self-organising process. Starting from a random coil, polypeptides fold into their characteristic working shape. The structure is held together by hydrogen bonds.
The stages are:
Without its correct three-dimensional structure a protein does not work. However, some parts of proteins may not fold: this is normal. 
If proteins do not fold into their native shape, they are inactive and are usually toxic. Several diseases are believed to result from misfolded proteins. Many allergies are caused by the folding of the proteins, for the immune system does not produce antibodies for all possible protein structures.
Chaperonins are large proteins which help the folding of some proteins after synthesis. Chaperones in general were first discovered helping histones and DNA join up to form nucleosomes. Nucleosomes are the builing blocks for chromosomes. It is now clear that this is the way many cell organelles are built up.

Anfinsen's dogma

Anfinsen's dogma is a hypothesis in molecular biology suggested by Christian Anfinsen. The idea is that a protein folding into its native structure is done automatically by the protein's amino acid sequence. It is only true for some proteins. For other proteins, chaperones are needed.
Anfinsen shared the 1972 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his work on the structure of the enzyme ribonuclease A. The dogma suggests that, in the conditions at which folding occurs, the native structure is a unique and stable state.
There are three conditions:
How the protein reaches this structure is the subject of the field of protein folding, which has a related dogma called Levinthal's paradox. The Levinthal paradox states that the number of possible conformations available to a given protein is astronomically large, such that even a small protein of 100 residues would require more time than the universe has existed to explore all possible conformations (10 seconds) and choose the appropriate one.
Prions are an exception to Anfinsen's dogma. Prions are stable conformations of proteins which differ from the native folding state. In Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (Mad Cow Disease), native proteins re-fold into a different stable conformation, which causes fatal amyloid buildup. Other amyloid diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are also exceptions to Anfinsen's dogma.

All Smiles Dental Centers

All Smiles Dental Centers is a company that manages dental offices in Texas. Its headquarters are in Farmers Branch, Texas. In September 2012 All Smiles had 20 clinics in Texas. The people who go to the clinics are mostly poor Hispanic children.
Dr. Richard Malouf started All Smiles in 2002. After the U.S. Supreme Court told the State of Texas that it did not give enough money to give dental care to poor children, five years before 2012 the State of Texas began spending $1.4 million more money on dental care for poor children. All Smiles began a braces program and began spending a lot of money, given by the Texas government, on braces for children. The Medicaid program only allowed braces if the braces helped a major problem like cleft lip and palate, or if it helps a problem caused by an illness, like Down's syndrome or muscular dystrophy. Malouf and his wife, Leanne, had a lot of rich things, like a mansion, two fancy cars, and two company jets.
In 2012 the State of Texas began trying to find out if All Smiles lied and took too much government money. The federal government accused All Smiles of cheating in the dental program, and so All Smiles promised to be honest in a contract written with the federal government. In July 2012 the company closed many braces offices and told patients that they could no longer go to All Smiles for braces.

Leaf-cutter ant

Leafcutter ant is the general name for any of 47 species of leaf-chewing ants of the two genera Atta and Acromyrmex. 
These species of tropical, fungus-growing ants are all endemic to South and Central America, Mexico and parts of the southern United States. Leafcutter ants "cut and process fresh vegetation (leaves, flowers, and grasses) to serve as nutrition for their fungal cultivars".
The "Acromyrmex" and "Atta" ants have much in common anatomically; however, the two can be identified by their external differences. "Atta" ants have three pairs of spines and a smooth exoskeleton on the upper surface of the thorax, while "Acromyrmex" ants have four pairs and a rough exoskeleton.
Next to humans, leafcutter ants form the largest and most complex animal societies on Earth. In a few years, the central mound of their underground nests can grow to more than across, with smaller, radiating mounds extending out to a radius of , taking up and containing eight million individuals.
Winged females and males leave their respective nests "en masse" and engage in a nuptial flight known as the "revoada". Each female mates with multiple males to collect the 300 million sperm she needs to set up a colony.
Once on the ground, the female loses her wings and searches for a suitable underground lair in which to found her colony. The success rate of these young queens is very low, and only 2.5% will go on to establish a long-lived colony. To start her own fungus garden, the queen stores bits of the parental fungus garden mycelium in a pocket in her mouth. 
In a mature leafcutter colony, ants are divided into castes, based mostly on size, that do different work. "Acromyrmex" and "Atta" show a high degree of biological polymorphism, with four castes in established colonies - minims, minors, mediae and majors. Majors are also known as soldiers. "Atta" ants are more polymorphic than "Acromyrmex", meaning there is comparatively less difference in size from the smallest to largest types of "Acromymex".
"Leaf-cutter ants are the major forest herbivores in Central America and consume more plant matter than all the vertebrate herbivores put together. Their subterranean nests can be vast and home to many millions of ants and they have a really neat defence system where minor workers ride shotgun on top of the leaf loads carried by the major workers and fend off the attacks of parasitic flies". George McGavin.

Governor of Michigan

The Governor of Michigan is the chief executive of the U.S. State of Michigan. The current Governor is Rick Snyder, a member of the Republican Party.
From the time the state was created until the election of 1966, governors were elected to two-year terms. Elections are held in November and the governor took office the next January. Until 1851, elections were held in odd-numbered years. A new state constitution was created in 1850 and took effect in 1851. Because of this, there was a single one-year term of governor in 1851. After this, elections were held on even years.
The constitution adopted in 1963 changed the governor's term to four years, starting in 1967. Since then, elections for governor have been two years before U.S. Presidential elections (for example, Presidential elections were in 2000 and 2004, elections for governor were in 1998 and 2002). The winner of the election takes office at noon on January 1 of the year after the election.
In 1992, a change to the Michigan constitution said that a person could only be governor for two terms. Before this, they were not limited as to how many terms they could serve. John Engler, the governor at the time, served three terms as his first term took place before the change was made. Engler was reelected in 1994 and 1998 before being term limited in 2002.
Forty-eight people have been governor of the state. Before becoming a state, there were five governors of the Michigan Territory. Stevens T.

Demographics

Demographics are statistical information about human populations (groups of people). The fields of sociology, demography, marketing, business, and others use the information that people who study demographics get. Some demographics that many demographers study are gender, race, jobs, and location (where people live).
"Demographic trends" are changes in those areas. For example, if a city was half women and half men in 1940 and was more than half women in 1980, and the number of women kept going up, that would be a demographic trend.

The Emperor's New Groove

The Emperor's New Groove is a 2000 American animated family movie. It was produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures through Buena Vista Distribution on December 15, 2000. The title refers to the fairy tale "The Emperor's New Clothes" by Hans Christian Andersen. The movie is not very much like the fairy tale.
The movie received an Academy Award nomination for Best Song for "My Funny Friend and Me" performed by Sting. It lost against "Things Have Changed" by Bob Dylan from "Wonder Boys".
A direct-to-video sequel, "Kronk's New Groove", was released in December 2005. There was also an animated television series, "The Emperor's New School", in January 2006.
Kuzco is the mean eighteen year old emperor of the South American Inca Empire. One day, he summons Pacha the leader of a nearby village and tells him that on his birthday, he intends to destroy Pacha's village to make way for "Kuzcotopia", his enormous summer home, consequently rendering Pacha and his family homeless. Meanwhile, Yzma, Kuzco's ancient and sour advisor, whom he has recently fired, decides to get revenge on him by poisoning him. She and her dimwitted lackey Kronk set up a feast for Kuzco as part of the plan. The plan goes awry when Kuzco is transformed into a llama. Yzma orders Kronk to dispose of the body, but Kronk, driven by conscience, accidentally loses the body on Pacha's cart.
When Pacha arrives home, he discovers Kuzco on the back of his cart. When the emperor realizes he is a llama, he asks Pacha to take him back to his palace and be reverted to human form. The peasant refuses, unless Kuzco builds his summer home somewhere else. Kuzco then decides to take a shortcut through the jungle, where he is attacked by jaguars and saved by Pacha. The two then spend the night in the jungle.
Meanwhile, at the palace, Yzma holds a fake-and rather halfhearted-funeral for Kuzco, before having the palace redecorated and taking the throne. When Kronk accidentally reveals that Kuzco is alive, he and Yzma go out searching for him. Meanwhile, Kuzco and Pacha are on their way to the palace. They cross a rope bridge, which nearly collapses. He then goes back on his word to build his summer home on top of Pacha's house. The two fight, consequently collapsing the bridge and end up stranded above a river filled with crocodiles. Working together, they escape and soon have to take a longer route to the palace.
Meanwhile, Kronk and Yzma are searching the jungle for Kuzco when Kronk uses his outdoor skills to ask a squirrel called Bucky for directions. Kuzco and Pacha meanwhile arrive at a diner, with Kuzco disguised as a woman. Yzma and Kronk also arrive, and Pacha overhears them talking about destroying the emperor. Pacha tries to warn Kuzco, but he does not believe him and the two angrily go their separate ways. When Kuzco overhears Yzma talking about killing him. He calls out for the peasant, but finds that Pacha has left.
After spending the night alone in the jungle, Kuzco is reunited with Pacha. They arrive at Pacha's house and enlist his family to distract Yzma and Kronk who are searching for them. The two villains pursue them to the palace, and the chase seemingly ends when they fall off a cliff and are struck by lightning, however they still inexplicably reach the palace first. Yzma orders Kronk to kill Kuzco, but he is driven once again by conscience and is unable to do so, which leads to Yzma insulting Kronk and his cooking, before deciding to finish the job herself. She then calls the palace guards-who think that Kuzco has been murdered-and attack him and Pacha, before they are transformed into animals and chase them.
Pacha and Kuzco take all the vials they can carry and Kuzco is transformed into a tortoise, parrot, whale and back to a llama. They end up down to two potions-one of which will turn Kuzco into a human. Yzma uses the first one to turn herself into a cat. Pacha and Kuzco try to retrieve the vial, which Yzma steals but she is unintentionally foiled by Kronk. Kuzco is then transformed back to a human, and resolves to becoming more selfless. He builds himself a modest summer cabin and moves in with Pacha and his family. Meanwhile, Yzma-still as a cat-reluctantly becomes a member of Kronk's Junior Chipmunk troop.

Small Smiles Dental Centers

Small Smiles Dental Centers (called Church Street Health Management and previously called FORBA) is a company that manages dental offices in the United States for poor people. Small Smiles has 70 centers in 22 states and Washington, DC. It has its headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee. The clinics are called many names, including Children's Dental Clinic, Indian Springs Dental Clinic, Oklahoma Smiles, Small Smiles Dentistry, Texas Smiles, and Wild Smiles.
The clinic comes from a dental clinic in Pueblo, Colorado that was started in 1928. The DeRose family and Dr. William Mueller owned the company.
In 2003 Michael DeRose, one of the DeRoses, bought a very expensive house in Pueblo for $3.4 million. When they owned the clinics, they put children in "papoose boards" to stop them from moving so they could quickly do dental work. The State of Colorado made a law to limit how much they could use the papoose boards. The offices also did lots of dental work on the children and put a lot of crowns on the children's teeth, so the Colorado government said that the clinics could only place a specified number crowns for each day. In 2006 the DeRose family sold the company to new owners.
In 2007 a news reporter named Roberta Baskin filmed the inside of a Small Smiles clinic. The film showed children screaming as the dentists did work on them, as the children were held in papoose boards. The main dentist said that, in one time, they often did six or more baby root canals on a child. He also said the clinic had goals to do a certain amount of dental work so the clinic could make money. The news report went on television and people began filing lawsuits against Small Smiles. A woman from Kentucky named Debbie Hagan started a blog that was against Small Smiles and what it did. Journalists and people from the New York State government talked to Hagan to learn about what was happening. On November 14, 2008, Small Smiles sued Hagan, saying that she published their documents without their permission. On April 16, 2009 the company stopped the lawsuit.
The US government filed a lawsuit against Small Smiles for cheating it of money that was to be spent on dental work for poor children. Small Smiles agreed to pay $24 million to the US government so the lawsuit would be ended. In February 2012 Small Smiles asked for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection.

Athletes at the Paralympics in 1972 were all afflicted by spinal cord injuries and required the use of a wheelchair. This is different from later Paralympics that include events for participants that fit into any of five different disability categories; amputation, either congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing.

Ernest Frederick I, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen

Ernst Frederick I, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen (Gotha, 21 August 1681 – Hildburghausen, 9 March 1724), was a duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen. He was the oldest son of Ernst, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen and Countess Sophie Henriette of Waldeck.
When he was younger, he served in the Netherlands army. He was wounded in the Spanish Succession War at Höchstädt. In 1715, after the death of his father, he left the Army and governed the duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen.
Like many German princes, He wanted his duchy to have the splendor of the court of the King Louis XIV of France. This caused him to be ruined financially.
Because he always needed money, he raised taxes and sold towns. He sold the county of Cuylenburg which was the dowry of his wife. The county was sold in 1720. He did not sell it to pay any money he owed to others. It was sold so that a garden and a channel could be built in his palace. In 1723 the Schalkau was sold to the duchy of Saxe-Meiningen. At the time, Schalkau had city privileges, and the right to hold a market. What was sold was an administrative division, much like a county, only smaller, which included Schalkau. The sale without the agreement of his wife was illegal. This led to a war with Saxe-Meiningen. At the end of the war, all of the county was ruined.
Because of his very bad taxes, in 1717 an open revolt took place in the duchy.
Ernst Frederick married Countess Sophia Albertine of Erbach-Erbach in Erbach on 4 February 1704. They had fourteen children:

Espadrilles are flat casual shoes or high heel sandals usually consisting of canvas or cotton fabric uppers and flexible sole made of jute, a natural fiber with vulcanized rubber underneath. These are worn primarily by women, although men wear the shoes also. These shoes are usually manufactured in Bangladesh and Spain. The soles of an espadrille are usually flat or platform wedge shape. These shoes are usually closed toed and closed backed, although some are open. Espadrilles can be easily slipped on the foot.
Closed toe canvas upper with flat wedge sole made of jute braids are the most popular casual espadrilles known as "Classic" or "Cotheeka Basic" espadrilles in the world. Different colored cotton or jute canvas uppers are used for this style of espadrille that made it very popular among the women as well as men. Striped canvas uppers are also used for these shoes.
High wedge jute sole with uppers of different materials like fabrics, leather etc. are used to make "Fashion espadrilles" which are also very popular among the women. Super models put on these style of espadrilles at fashion shows. These espadrilles are also known as "Party espadrilles". Almost all the designer brands of Europe and North America design these styles of espadrilles.

ReachOut Healthcare America

ReachOut Healthcare America (RHA) is an American company that manages dental clinics. Its headquarters are in Phoenix, Arizona. Under the name "Big Smiles," it coordinates dentist vans that go to American schools and do dental checkups and dental work on poor children. In 2011 the dentists that do business with the company went to 8,700 schools and screened and/or worked on 488,000 children.
Michael Howell and Daniel Goldsmith started the ReachOut company in 1997. At first the company coordinated dental checkups and dental work for people in nursing homes in Michigan. The company began coordinating services to schools. It later began doing coordination for schools, foster programs, group homes, homeless shelters, and mental health facilities by late 2003.
In October 2011 a Camp Verde, Arizona boy who had dental work done by a dentist linked with ReachOut complained of pain. His mother, Stacey Gagnon, said that the dentist did dental work on the boy without asking the parents if it was okay. Darren and Stacey Gagnon, the parents of the boy, sued the dentist and the Reachout company. In November 2011, Dan Brown, then the superintendent of the Camp Verde Unified School District, signed a letter saying that ReachOut cannot go to the district's schools anymore.
At one time ReachOut had dentists go to schools in the Clark County School District, the biggest school district in the state of Nevada. In December 2011 the district stopped working with ReachOut.
Ken Tucker, a reporter for the newspaper "Arizona Republic", said said that some parents at the schools said that ReachOut dentists did dental work without telling the parents. He said that the main reason was that ReachOut did not give good care after the dental work was done because the dentists only came to the school two times per year. A mobile dentist who worked with ReachOut, Derryl Brian, said that the dentists under ReachOut had, since 2006, done screenings and work on 80,000 children. Brian said that a lot of people liked what they did.
Several school districts in Arizona, as of August 2012, still work with ReachOut. ReachOut gave care for over 2,000 students of the Peoria Unified School District in Greater Phoenix. ReachOut gave care to twenty Peoria USD schools that have lots of poor children. The ReachOut website has leters from a school nurse in Tucson, Arizona and an elementary school principal of the Deer Valley Unified School District in Greater Phoenix which say good things about ReachOut.

Self-organization

Self-organization is a process where some form of order arises out of a random system. The process is spontaneous: it happens on its own. It is not directed or controlled by any agent inside or outside the system.
Self-organization occurs in a variety of physical, chemical, biological, social and cognitive systems. A common example is crystallization. An example from biological chemistry is the lipid bilayer, which is the basis of the cell membrane, and so is of great importance.
Many self-organising things have properties which are "emergent". What this means is that one can't predict what will happen, usually because the possibilities are too many to study. Some examples:

Peer Gynt is a dramatic poem by Henrik Ibsen, written in 1867. Ibsen based this work on Norse fairy tales written by Peter Christen Asbjørnsen. Asbjørnsen had written these stories about 1848-1850. Ibsen wrote the poem to analyse and criticize the romantic nationalist movement that was present in Norway during that time. 
Originally, Peer Gynt was a poem, but Ibsen later adapted it to be a stage play. Edvard Grieg composed the original music for the stage. The first performance was on 24 February 1876, in Christiania, modern-day Oslo. The musical score for the play is made of 26 pieces. In 1888 and 1891, Grieg took eight pieces, and comined them into two suites, of four pieces each. These are known as the Peer Gynt Suites today, and are widely known.
Many movies were made about the subject, the first in 1915.

Klara Hitler

Klara Hitler (born Klara Pölzl, 12 August 1860 - 21 December 1907) was an Austrian woman. She was the widow of Alois Hitler and the mother of German dictator Adolf Hitler.
Klara was born in the Austrian village of Spital, Weitra, Lower Austria. Her father was Johann Baptist Pölzl and her mother was Johanna Hiedler. Either Hiedler's father, Johann Nepomuk Hiedler, or his brother, Johann Georg Hiedler, was the biological father of Alois Hitler, the man she would later marry. It is presumed and accepted by most that the father was Johann Georg Hiedler. Klara and Alois were first cousins once removed. 
In 1876, three years after Alois Hitler's first marriage to Anna Glasl-Hörer, Klara's uncle Alois had hired her as a household servant. She was 16 years old at the time. After the death of his second wife, Franziska Matzelsberger, in 1884, Alois and Klara were married on 7 January 1885 in a wedding held early in the morning at Hitler's rooms on the top floor of the Pommer Inn in Braunau. Alois then went to work for the day at his job as a customs official. Klara still called Alois "uncle" after the marriage. Their first son, Gustav, was born four months later, on 15 May 1885. Their second child, Ida, was born on 23 September 1886. Both infants died of diphtheria during the winter of 1886-1887. A third child, Otto, was born and died in 1887.
Adolf was born 20 April 1889, followed by Edmund on 24 March 1894 and Paula on 21 January 1896. Edmund died of measles on 28 February 1900, at the age of five. Klara's adult life was spent keeping house and raising children. According to Smith, Alois had little understanding or interest in raising children. Historian Alice Miller later wrote, "The family structure could well be characterized as the prototype of a totalitarian regime. Its sole, undisputed, often brutal ruler is the father. The wife and children are totally subservient to his will, his moods, and his whims; they must accept humiliation and injustice unquestioningly and gratefully. Obedience is their primary rule of conduct."
Klara was very devoted to her children. According to William Patrick Hitler, she was a typical stepmother to her stepchildren, Alois Jr. and Angela.
Klara was a devout Roman Catholic. She worshipped at church regularly with her children. Of her six children with Alois, only Adolf and Paula survived childhood.
Alois's and Klara's children were:
When Alois died in 1903, he left her a government pension. She sold the house in Leonding and moved with young Adolf and Paula to an apartment in Linz. Three or four years later, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. After many painful iodoform treatments given by her doctor, Eduard Bloch, Klara died at home in Linz from the toxic medical side-effects on 21 December 1907. Adolf and Paula were at her side. Klara was buried in Leonding near Linz.
Adolf Hitler had a close relationship with his mother. He was crushed by her death and carried the grief for the rest of his life. Bloch later recalled that, after Klara's death, he had seen in "one young man never so much pain and suffering broken fulfilled". Decades later, in 1940, Hitler showed gratitude to Bloch (who was Jewish) by letting him and his wife to leave Austria and go to the United States.

Tamil was one of the dominant language of trade during the pre-colonial era by people like Ainnurruvar and such as Tamil inscriptions and coins found on many parts of Asia and Africa such as on China, Cambodia, Egypt and Indonesia.
During 18th Century, the British and French rules brought the Tamils to the many parts of Asia and Africa which makes many countries with significant Tamil speakers and cultural impact such as there are more than 2,100,000 speakers of Tamil language in the Malaysia itself.
There are also claims for to make Tamil as official language of India and UN.

Thomas Cech

Thomas Robert Cech (born December 8, 1947 in Chicago) is an American chemist who shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Sidney Altman. They discovered that RNA was a catalyst. Cech discovered that RNA could itself cut strands of RNA, which showed that life could have started as RNA. 
Cech also studied telomeres, and his lab discovered an enzyme, TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase), which helps to restore telomeres after they are shortened during cell division. 
As president of Howard Hughes Medical Institute, he promoted science education, and he teaches an undergraduate chemistry course at the University of Colorado.
Cech's main research area is transcription in the nucleus of cells. He studies how the genetic code of DNA is transcribed into RNA. In the 1970s, Cech discovered that an unprocessed RNA molecule could splice itself. In 1982, Cech became the first to show that RNA molecules are not restricted to being passive carriers of genetic information they can have catalytic functions and can take part in cellular reactions. RNA-processing reactions and protein synthesis on ribosomes are catalysed by RNA. RNA enzymes are known as ribozymes and are now used for gene technology. They also cut and destroy invading viral RNAs.

Reverse transcriptase

A reverse transcriptase is an enzyme which works 'backwards' from RNA to DNA. Normal transcription involves the synthesis of RNA from DNA; reverse transcription is the "reverse" of this. It is a DNA polymerase enzyme that transcribes single-stranded RNA into single-stranded DNA. It also synthesizes a second strand of DNA complementary to the reverse-transcribed single-stranded cDNA. 
Well studied reverse transcriptases include:
Reverse transcriptase was discovered by Howard Temin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in a cancer virus. It was independently isolated by David Baltimore in 1970 at MIT from two RNA tumour viruses. For their achievements, they shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (with Renato Dulbecco).
The idea of reverse transcription was very unpopular at first because it contradicted the central dogma of molecular biology. This states that DNA is transcribed into RNA which is then translated into proteins. However, in 1970 when Howard Temin and David Baltimore both independently discovered the enzyme responsible for reverse transcription, the possibility that genetic information could be passed on in this manner was finally accepted.
Out of this work has come the idea that the first genomes were made of RNA genes. The RNA genes surviving today might be all that remain of this early condition. Reverse transcriptase might be the remnant of a stage when DNA genes were made by copying RNA genes. This theory is relevant to the earliest stages of evolution. Reverse transcription is also used by various semi-independent elements called transposons.

Under this law, no U.S. State or political subdivision is required to recognize same-sex marriage from outside States. However, the Obama Administration, in 2011, announced that Section 3 was declared unconstitutional and would no longer defend it in courts. The Section 3 part of DOMA has been marked as not constitutional by eight federal courts as of 2012. Currently, 16 states and the District of Columbia perform same sex marriage, although that could change in upcoming years. On June 26, 2013, Section 3 of the act was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States.

Transfection is the process of deliberately introducing DNA or RNA into cells. The word is formed from
transformation and infection. 
The term is used for: 
Transfection can result in unexpected morphologies and abnormalities in target cells. Transfection with RNA molecules produces changes which cannot be permanently transmitted down a line of cells.
A DNA construct is an artificially constructed bit of nucleic acid which is going to be 'transplanted' into a target tissue or cell. It may include a DNA insert, which contains the gene sequence coding for a protein of interest. 
The DNA insert is the heart of the molecular biology vector. This is a general term for a vehicle used to transfer foreign genetic material into another cell. Transfection of animal cells usually involves opening temporary pores (holes) in the cell membrane, to allow the cells to take up the vector.

<doc id="366966" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=366966" title="Antibiotic resistance">
Antibiotic resistance

Antibiotics can kill certain kinds of microorganisms. Over time, those microorganisms often develop resistance to the anitibiotics. Called antibiotic resistance, this is one of the most serious problems facing modern surgery and medicine. It is also one of the best examples of evolution in action.
Antibiotic resistance spreads very quickly, far faster than microbiologists expected. "As long as new drugs keep coming, resistance is not a problem. "But there has not been a new class of antibiotics discovered since the 1980s"". It is now known that bacteria have a special mechanism, the integron, which speeds up the spread of resistance.
A well-known example of natural selection in action is the development of antibiotic resistance in microorganisms. Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Alexander Fleming, antibiotics have been used to fight bacterial diseases. Natural populations of bacteria contain, among their vast numbers of individual members, considerable variation in their genetic material, as the result of mutations. When exposed to antibiotics, most bacteria die quickly, but some may have mutations that make them slightly less susceptible. If the exposure to antibiotics is short, these individuals will survive the treatment. This selective elimination of maladapted individuals from a population is natural selection.
In Fleming's 1945 Nobel Prize lecture he said:
Maclyn McCarty explained what it was like before antibiotics:
All surgery that involves cutting open the body poses massive risks of infection. Antibiotics given before and after surgery allow surgeons to do operations that would have been deadly before. Open-heart surgery is one obvious example.
Cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy damage the immune system. Antibiotics are prescribed to boost the body's natural defences. Patients with organ transplants always use drugs to suppress the immune system, otherwise it attacks the transplant. Therefore, antibiotics are used to protect the body. Without effective antibiotics, both sets of patients might die from infections which their immune systems could no longer control.
Medical uses are also threatened. The number of tests coming back with resistance to carbapenems, one of the most powerful groups of antibiotics, has soared from a handful of cases in 2003 to more than 300 cases by 2010. "My lab is seeing an increasing number of resistant strains year on year," said Prof Neil Woodford, of the Health Protection Agency's antimicrobial resistance unit. Most cases are resistant to some drugs. Even worse, there are a few cases of strains which "no antibiotic can touch".
Many infections which were almost eliminated are coming back. The sexually transmitted disease gonorrhoea is becoming increasingly difficult to treat. Around the world, multi-drug resistant and extremely-drug resistant tuberculosis is a growing problem. Only a couple of drugs still work.
Infections that hit the elderly when they are in hospital are one of the main concerns. The greatest threat in the UK is opportunistic bugs which live in the gut such as "E. coli" and "Klebsiella".
They are now the most common form of infection which patients get in hospital. They show rising levels of resistance to antibiotics.
The UK Cabinet Office has issued a warning by the National Risk Register for Civil Emergencies. It says "the number of infections complicated by antimicrobial resistance could increase markedly over the next 20 years".
"Without effective antibiotics, even minor surgery and routine operations could become high-risk procedures, leading to increased duration of illness and ultimately premature mortality".
The WHO has issued similar assessments:
Given enough time, and repeated exposure to the antibiotic, a population of antibiotic-resistant bacteria will emerge. This leads to what is known as an evolutionary arms race, or co-evolution, in which bacteria continue to develop strains that are less susceptible to antibiotics, while medical researchers continue to develop new antibiotics that can kill them. In response, doctors use different, stronger antibiotics. However, new strains of Methicillin-resistant "Staphylococcus aureus" (MRSA) have emerged that are resistant even to these drugs. A similar situation occurs with pesticide resistance in plants and insects, and with malarial resistance to quinine.
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. It is caused by various types of mycobacteria, usually "Mycobacterium tuberculosis". The disease usually attacks the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body. The pathogen can travel through the air, and spread from one person to the next. Experts believe that one third of the world population is infected with "M. tuberculosis". New infections occur at a rate of one per second.
Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. "Extensively drug-resistant TB" is also resistant to three or more of the six classes of second-line drugs.
Totally drug-resistant TB was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012. It is resistant to all currently used drugs.
Malaria infections are not caused by bacteria: they are caused by a protozoan parasite injected into the blood by a mosquito. They are normally treated by a 
combination of two drugs, artemether-lumefantrine. Now four cases have occurred in Britain where the drugs have failed. The patients got the disease in Africa. A doctor said "It is an early sign and we need to take it quite seriously as it may be snowballing into something with greater impact".
The first new antibiotic in forty years has been discovered. It is called "teixobactin", and researchers say it is very promising. It has not yet been developed and tested, so it will be some time before it is in doctors' hands. It only works on gram-positive bacteria. However, that does include MRSA and "Mycobacterium tuberculosis".

Welcome to the of the Cégep de Saint-Hyacinthe. This project aims to bring English as a second language students from Cégep de Saint-Hyacinthe to edit Wikipedia articles in a fun way! We will first open an account and do some introduction exercises such as wiki-races to get familiar with Wikipedia. Second, students will choose subjects to work on and find reliable sources on the Web or in library. Finally, each student will have to add content to existing articles or create a new one (a stub).
Wiki-race: For this exercise, you must start the race on an article and finish on another by clicking on the least blue links possible. For example, you must start the race on the article "Ice hockey" and finish on the article "Gas" by clicking on the least blue links. Example: Ice hockey > Ice > Liquid > Gas (3 clicks)

Can somebody explain why it is so?

I see "(one-case-only article)" after some new articles. I'm guessing it's from an Edit filter or something, since it's used fairly often. Also, I really don't know what "one-case-only" is supposed to mean. So ... where does it come from and what does it mean? --"  07:34, 6 October 2012 (UTC)
I've been working on the Baltimore article and finally got around to the sports teams. I was just working on the Baseball section and I couldn't, for the life of me, figure out a better way to say "inducted into the Hall of Fame." An example sentence would be: "Cal Ripken, Jr. was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame."
"Induction" is a funny verb, and it's not one I'd consider particularly simple. You don't get "inducted" into other places, or record books. Personally the verb's connotations from physics and chemistry are more familiar to me than this other use. Unfortunately, I couldn't think of any other way to phrase this. I wanted, at minimum, to set aside the meaning in parentheticals -- eg. "was inducted into (admitted to) the Hall of Fame" -- but I couldn't think of a good way of saying it. "Admitted to", which was the best I could come up with, seems to indicate that the Hall of Fame is a physical building that only the best ball players are allowed into.

"Please translate for your local community"
Hello All,
The Wikimedia Foundation's Fundraising team have begun our 'User Experience' project, with the goal of understanding the donation experience in different countries outside the USA and enhancing the localization of our donation pages. I am searching for volunteers to spend 30 minutes on a Skype chat with me, reviewing their own country's donation pages. It will be done on a 'usability' format (I will ask you to read the text and go through the donation flow) and will be asking your feedback in the meanwhile. 
The only pre-requisite is for the volunteer to actually live in the country and to have access to at least one donation method that we offer for that country (mainly credit/debit card, but also real-time banking like IDEAL, E-wallets, etc...) so we can do a live test and see if the donation goes through. "All volunteers will be reimbursed of the donations that eventually succeed" (and they will be low amounts, like 1-2 dollars)
By helping us you are actually helping thousands of people to support our mission of free knowledge across the world. Please sing up and help us with our 'User Experience' project! :)
If you are interested (or know of anyone who could be) please email ppena@wikimedia.org. All countries needed (excepting USA)!
Thanks!

Dear Wikipedians,
I would like to announce that I will start a little school project, something very small and simple. I will assist an English teacher, , to introduce students to the wonderful world of Wikipedia. I'm from the , experienced editor, working on WP/Commons since 2003 and I have 50,000 edits overall. 
It was that the community on Simple English is small, and past school projects were bad experiences for this community. I'd like to reassure you; they are a small group of students who will be supervised by the teacher and myself. We will keep an eye on every single edit from each student. 
At first, students will be on "Read only" mode, doing some exercises. Then they will have to find sources about a subject they chose. And then only, they will have to add only couple of sourced phrases on their personnal userpages. It is nothing big, only to make them practice English, being able to find reliable sources, and eventually edit Wikipedia a little.
These young fellows are studying English at the and the project page is .
If you have any advice for me or the teacher miss Pearson, please do so. We are very open to any suggestions. Best regards. () 22:16, 20 October 2012 (UTC)
Hello,
As previously mentionned, I'm starting a school project. First course was this afternoon and we had a little problem. The Wiki software stopped accepting new inscription after 6... Yes the school is sharing the same IP address, but is there a way to prevent this? Tomorrow, there's another class and we'd like have all students subscribed. Thank you for your tips.

Most country articles have a list of all countries sharing the border with it in the lead paragraph, which makes everything somewhat confusing on the larger scale for the reader. I propose having a new section/ dropbox/infobox with just a list of 'countries sharing the border with Country X' in the country X article for clearer understanding
I think it will be best if we add an infobox or something at the top of the article linking it to the English wikipedia page [Sort of what uncyclopedia does to Wikipedia articles at the end]. 
It is very cumbersome to figure out how to go to the original Wiki page for further reading, if I am reading the simple version. Also, most of the times when I browse simple, I find it more than useful to go to the original wikipedia article for further reading on most not-so-gigantic articles. This ought to provide a quick and convenient way to travel through wikis..

I think I have already pointed out that translations of the week can give us visibility, if someone actually takes the time to do a good translation. We do have the comfortable positrion that we provide "another view" of the English-languguage Wikipedia, which is hopefully easier to understand. That way, people with limited English skills might use our "page" as a reference for their translation. I have started a stub on the current Translation of the week, Cult suicide, but it still needs a category. The annex page Destructive cult needs simplification. I am also not sure to what extent discussion of groups that have used cult suicides in the past is helpful to our readers. Anyway, please simplify & extend, if you have the time, as such exercises might result in new editors in the future. -- () 10:08, 8 November 2012 (UTC)

Hello Simple Wikipedians, I'd like to attract your attention to our recently published research paper A Practical Approach to Language Complexity: A Wikipedia Case Study. In this paper we focus on linguistic features of Simple WP and compare it to the main English WP. We provide some conclusions and suggestions to the WP community. Comments and questions are very welcome. () 16:23, 8 November 2012 (UTC)
An interesting and very complex article (would that be difficult to write in simple English!). If I understand it, it says we are doing well in making sentences shorter, and less complex. But we need to make more effort to make the actual words simple. So let us look forward to valuable help from this study to make the Simple English Wikipedia really simple.

How can I edit the pages well? I am a student french who learns english. Also, I have placed a Template on my discussion page.
Hi all, some may still remember the Pakistan POV editor (which is not that accurate nowadays, because he/she edits some articles not exactly related to Pakistan). There have been many discussions both on this page and in the past (a few here: , , , ). Administrators past and present, including , , and myself have been adopting a block on sight approach.
Considering that there have been no improvements in the editor's disruptive editing and the fact that not many people seem to be willing to clear up after his edits, I am letting everyone know here that I have, over the last few days, gone one step further and applied several relatively major range blocks that are being used by the editor:
These blocks are all anon only, with account creation enabled. I ask that anyone who wishes to challenge this decision look at previous edits before going further.     16:37, 12 November 2012 (UTC)
A range of small related questions are suggested by .
A discussion about format consistency is trivial, but it may have consequences in large classes or categories of articles, for example
As explained at , format consistency is relevant in many articles which each have a similar succession box format.
For example, see . The succession box format which is used in this Japanese era class or category dates from May 2012. The is made clear in serial edit summaries.
Currently, the consistency of format across the range of Japanese era ("nengō") articles is a common feature of this class or category . 
The consistent navbox graphics at the bottom of the page are intended to draw a helpful visual connection among the related articles.
The repeating format is also mirrored in non-standard succession boxes which are necessary in articles about a few Japanese eras of the late-7th and early-8th centuries. 
Comments and discussion are invited on the articles' talk pages, 
It is not easy or obvious to guess how to work through these kinds of graphics issues. 
For example, the current succession box at Taika (era) works well enough, but would a change be better across the of 200+ articles? 
Looking forward, I wonder what is better? best? 
In our , this thread begs a couple of other questions: "What is to be done next? What is to be learned from this?" -- () 18:34, 15 November 2012 (UTC)
This could be templated to ease its use. The table class could also be tweaked for changes in color or borders, but for the most part the basic wikitable class is often a good choice. -- 19:55, 16 November 2012 (UTC)
Côte d'Ivoire is not the common name used in English sources. Sources like The New York Times The Washington Post, Bloomberg Reuters The International Business Times The Associated Press Businessweek ESPN Voice of America and The Guardian to name a few, prefer Ivory Coast by an order of magnitude. is also the name chosen for the English Wikipedia article version. Côte d'Ivoire is only used by very minor news outlets like AllAfrica.com and in national sports news. () 09:11, 24 November 2012 (UTC)
I don't think we should always take the PoV of anyone. But, I do think what any entity chooses as its own name should have more weight than what a foreign media chooses to name it. This is more the case when the name chosen is seen as troublesome to the entity's identity such as a connection to illegal activity. In this case, the globally banned ivory trade. Other countries have chosen to change their name for various reasons and while there are some public holdouts to the old name, generally the new name is the one used. As time goes on, the holdouts grow smaller. In this case, (mainly American) media refuses to accept the change and forces their PoV on the world. I'm not choosing the PoV of the political elite, I'm shying away from the PoV of the media elite. As to every day speech, I'm willing to bet over 75% of the English speaking population has never used either name.. probably couldn't even tell you were the country was.. same with many of the names I listed above (and many others). I don't see either name choice having any real impact outside of people from that area. -- 13:23, 24 November 2012 (UTC)
That move request on enwiki could have gone either way in my opinion, and then it was "barely" held up at Move review (it didn't look like a consensus to me, but then I didn't read the whole discussion). I do note from a few quick searches on Google that, yes, the vast majority of Western media seems to prefer the historical English name. African and local media in English appear to use the official name (which sees "Cote d'Ivoire" with more than double the amount of hits as "Ivory Coast", but from a smaller number of news sources). A ngram of books on Google shows that usage of "Ivory Coast" is more common, but has been declining, steadily, since they changed the name. Governments of major English-speaking countries appear to use the official name (Australia, Canada, South Africa, UK, U.S.). () 03:20, 25 November 2012 (UTC)
I have recently migrated "Xerochrysum bracteatum", a featured article in the English Wikipedia, to Simple. It needs a bit of work though to meet the standards for VGA here.

Any help that can be provided would be greatly appreciated. () 15:24, 27 November 2012 (UTC)

Why are you refusing my augscend page?
It doesn't conflict with anyone else's usage and it is just intended to explain an idea.
Neither Wikipedia or Google can find 'augscend' so why can't I use it to name an idea?
Also, why is it so hard to insert images - it makes it impossible to illustrate a concept.
How can one talk about an new idea if it is so hard to cite the idea? 
After reading the page that I had mention in the title, I suspect that the sentence "...largest possible number..." should be alter to "...smallest possible number...". no reply please.

Does anyone have any problem with this or additional suggestions for changes? () 00:30, 7 December 2012 (UTC)
As I use the AWB app more here I notice that some of the logic is a little buggy for how things are done in Simple and I think in addition to the See also and External links suggestions above there are a few additional things that we may want to look at:
I'm sure there are more and if I write these up I would submit them as individual changes to make it easier to comment and discuss them each on their own merits rather than as a group.[[User:Kumioko|Kumioko]] ([[User talk:Kumioko|talk]]) 18:50, 8 December 2012 (UTC)
Since it seems that most folks are agreeable to making some of these changes to AWB so the app is a little more useful here, I went ahead and submitted some here for a feature request and here for some bugs in the logic for this site.

There are alternatives to deletion also. Off the top of my head, one would be turning it into a stealth template, so that it still categorises but doesn't show anything (although that might result in some other technical issues). It "is" far too much distraction for such a small issue, but it does serve purposes in many situations, and for editors (like me) who routinely go through the maintenance backlog, its placement helps identify pages that have had issues for far too long.

Hello all! My name is Elvis Chirinos Jr, I'm a film major and wanted to contribute wiki's for films and incoming projects. The first one I saught out was a project called boiling pot. It has an interesting cast (which is what caught my attention) and premise. However, reading all the guidelines, im not sure im "allowed" to write an article on this (I've already written it on word, and its sitting in my computer). Anyways, if anyone could throw any tips my way... such as how to start an article ( i think i "have" most of the formatting down) but i still need help, as learning all this stuff from the ground up is fairly difficult. Anyways, let me know what you guys think!

I just wanted to let everyone know that there is a discussion at the English WP to add a more pronounced link here for articles that are common between the 2. This is primarily due to input from the Article feedback tool, where many users have voiced their frustrations at the complicated articles there. The links to those discussions are (here) and at the English Wikipedia Village pump (idea lab) (here).
As a side note, I think it would be good to do something here that could load the readers to the corresponding English WP article if they want more details about the article they read here. [[User:Kumioko|Kumioko]] ([[User talk:Kumioko|talk]]) 22:57, 2 December 2012 (UTC)
How would you feel about putting the English Interwiki link non the top here also if applicable? It seems this would be a useful thing to do here as well. That way if the reader wanted to learn more about the subject they could clikc that and jump over to EN. [[User:Kumioko|Kumioko]] ([[User talk:Kumioko|talk]]) 14:55, 3 December 2012 (UTC)
Since it seems that there is a general agreement that some additional promotion of the project on En is good, does anyone have any suggestions for what to say?

Below is a blurb I wrote up to add to the Sign post at English Wikipedia to promote this site. 
Are you interested in expanding your role in other MediaWiki projects outside the English Wikipedia? Do you find that the the English Wikipedia is too hard to read, use or edit? Try the [[:simple:|Simple English Wikipedia]] version of Wikipedia. It uses fewer words and easier grammar. At the start, it was designed for people learning English. Its style may help readers understand difficult concepts. With less that 90, 000 articles, less rules and easier to read articles it offers possibilities to editors who may feel limited in what they can do in the English Wikipedia.
I anyone has any suggestions please feel free. [[User:Kumioko|Kumioko]] ([[User talk:Kumioko|talk]]) 18:33, 8 December 2012 (UTC)

At the same time, I would like to ask that these links be included only if Commons actually has something on the topic. I've seen several new pages recently with Commons links where the link doesn't go anywhere. It's good to include the Commons link when Commons has something related, but not all articles need Commons links.

Hi, I just found my way here upon noticing an edit summary in main wikipedia article Elks Temple (Boise, Idaho), an article I had created. The version of that article here in simple Wikipedia doesn't show any much attribution of the Wikipedia article's authors is edit history, seeming to show a brand new article creation. A bot adding a link to the Wikipedia article does not convey authorship credit, any more than the corresponding bot adding to the Wikipedia article conveys authorship to the new simple one.
Was this one article started correctly here, or not? What are guidelines/policy for showing attribution here?
In general, this seems like a great project. Cheers, --[[User:Doncram|Doncram]] ([[User talk:Doncram|talk]]) 17:50, 31 December 2012 (UTC)

The proposal for listing Simple at the top of the language links on English Wikipedia is now being voted on. It is not going well. I'm surprised at some of the things that have been said. Anyway, even if you joined in with the earlier discussion, you will need to plunge in again. Nothing you said before will count, only what is on the voting page.

Hello,
I added a configuration to [[:Wikipedia talk:How to write Simple English pages]], for Miszabot to archive the page. Most of the discussions are over 6 months old. Archival settings are to leave 4 threads on the page, no matter what, and to create a new archive once 125k content is reached. Currently, the whole page is about 50-60k, but discussions go back a few years. Does anyone have an opinion on automatically archiving (low traffic) project talk pages? --[[User:Eptalon|Eptalon]] ([[User talk:Eptalon|talk]]) 15:29, 4 January 2013 (UTC)
It came up to me while I was adding some links to articles. Why do we call minor changes like that? "Minor" can be quite a difficult word: it is not [[Wikipedia:Basic English ordered wordlist|here]] for example. Can't we change it into "Small changes" instead? --[[User:Mark91|Mark91]] 11:45, 8 January 2013 (UTC)
Thank you to everyone who volunteered last year on the Wikimedia fundraising 'User Experience' project. We have talked to many different people in different countries and their feedback has helped us immensely in restructuring our pages. If you haven't heard of it yet, the 'User Experience' project has the goal of understanding the donation experience in different countries (outside the USA) and enhancing the localization of our donation pages. 
I am (still) searching for volunteers to spend some time on a Skype chat with me, reviewing their own country's donation pages. It will be done on a 'usability' format (I will ask you to read the text and go through the donation flow) and will be asking your feedback in the meanwhile. 
The only pre-requisite is for the volunteer to actually live in the country and to have access to at least one donation method that we offer for that country (mainly credit/debit card, but also real time banking like IDEAL, E-wallets, etc...) so we can do a live test and see if the donation goes through. **All volunteers will be reimbursed of the donations that eventually succeed (and they will be very low amounts, like 1-2 dollars)**
By helping us you are actually helping thousands of people to support our mission of free knowledge across the world. If you are interested (or know of anyone who could be) please email ppena@wikimedia.org. All countries needed (excepting USA)!!
Thanks!

Hello everybody, I hope I'm writing on the right page, otherwise I apologize.
I'm an italian student and I'm working in the field of computational semantics (for a university project, no money around it :D). In particular, I tried to collect some statistics about Simple English Wikipedia pages, and particularly about terms that belong to the list shown in this page:
[[Wikipedia:Basic_English_combined_wordlist]]
As you can see, a lot of these words do not own a content page in the encyclopedia. Others have instead a link to a wiktionary page. My simple request is as follows: could anyone of you, writers of simple wikipedia articles, fill this gap? The main target should be to cover all the terms that are names or adjectives (i.e. not conjunctions), for example: accessory, trouble, seat,comfort...all the words that are very important in the english language should have a content page with at least a simple description and 2-3 links to other articles.
My research will go further anyway, but even 10 more page for terms in this list could be a great gain in precision. I know you are volunteers and I thank you for the great work you are doing on this project. And a special thanks to those who will find some minutes to perform this task.
Best regards.
Giorgio

Mitch McConnell

Addison Mitchell "Mitch" McConnell, Jr. (born February 20, 1942) is the senior United States Senator from Kentucky. A member of the Republican Party, he is the Majority Leader of the Senate, succeeding Harry Reid. He is the longest serving U.S. Senator in Kentucky history. 
Mitch McConnell was born in Sheffield, Alabama on February 20, 1942. He was raised in southern Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Julia (née Shockley) and Addison Mitchell McConnell. He attended the duPont Manual High School. In 1964, he graduated with honors from the University of Louisville with a B.A. in political science. He graduated in 1967 from the University of Kentucky College of Law. 
In 1984, McConnell ran for the United States Senate against two-term Democratic incumbent Walter "Dee" Huddleston. The election race wasn't decided until the last polls returned came in, and McConnell won by a thin margin—only 5,200 votes out of more than 1.8 million votes cast, just over 0.4%. 
McConnell was the only Republican Senate challenger to win that year, despite Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in the presidential election. Part of McConnell's success came from a series of television campaign spots called "Where's Dee", which featured a group of bloodhounds trying to find Huddleston, implying that Huddleston's attendance record in the Senate was less than stellar. It is likely that he was helped by Ronald Reagan's 21-point win in Kentucky that year. His campaign bumper stickers and television ads asked voters to "Switch to Mitch".
McConnell is a member of the Baptist Church. His first wife was Sherrill Redmon, from whom he was later divorced; they have three daughters. His second wife, whom he married in 1993, is Elaine Chao, the current Secretary of Transportation under Donald Trump and the former Secretary of Labor under George W. Bush (the first Asian American woman to serve in the Cabinet).
Senator McConnell's personal fortune was between $9,839,049 to $44,587,000 in 2010 and he was ranked as the 10th wealthiest member of the U.S. Senate.

<doc id="367021" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367021" title="Leopard gecko">
Leopard gecko

The Leopard gecko, also known as the Panther gecko or the Common Leopard gecko, is a medium-sized lizard of the genus "Eublepharis". They can be found in the southern part of Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, northwest India, and parts of Iran; living mostly in dry rocky regions, dry grasslands and deserts.
Leopard geckos are around 7-9 inches (17.8-22.9 cm) long, with large heads, big eyes with oval-shaped pupils, thin toes, and, unlike other reptiles, they have eyelids. They have thick tails that narrow to a point and, like their bodies and heads, are slightly flattened from top to bottom. Most of their scales are small and rough. Spaced rows of larger, bumpy scales give them a knobby, rough look, but they are actually soft when touched.
Baby Leopard geckos are 85 mm long when they hatch, and when they hatch they have dark bands which go around their bodies.These bands lighten as the babies grow into adults which have spots instead of bands. Leopard geckos are normally lavender or yellow in colour, but pet Leopard geckos come in different "colour morphs" like albino, "Banana blizzard", "Blizzard", "Ghost", "High Yellow", "Hyper Xanthic", "Jungle", "Leucistic", "Normal" or "Wild", "Patternless", "Red-stripe", "Snow", "Tremper Albino" and many more.
Like many lizards, the Leopard gecko has a tail that breaks off when grabbed by a predator. The tail breaks at a crack in the vertebra, and the surrounding muscles are arranged so that they separate neatly and instantly. A muscle closes around the artery in the tail at the point of the break and stops blood loss. Normally a new tail grows back. This method helps the Leopard gecko to escape when attacked. 
The Leopard gecko is found in dry rocky regions, dry grasslands and deserts of southern Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, northwest India, and parts of Iran.
The temperatures of these areas during winter can be quite low, below , forcing the animals underground into semi-hibernation, called "brumation", and they live on fat reserves. Leopard geckos are crepuscular reptiles; during the day they hide in burrows, but they are active at dawn and dusk when the temperature is favorable.
Leopard Geckos are friendly, docile creatures by nature, but they sometimes bite. If held in a human hand they will only bite if they mistake a finger for food, or if the person is holding the gecko too tightly.
In the wild, Leopard geckos feed mainly on insects, fruits, spiders, snails, small lizards, birds, and bird eggs. In captivity they feed on mealworms, crickets, and sometimes baby mice.
Leopard geckos reach sexual maturity at the age of one to three years. Mating usually happens during the rainy season. During courtship, the male walks alongside the female, licking and lightly biting her side. He then grasps her neck in his mouth. If she accepts to mate with him, she lifts her tail allowing the male to insert one of his paired copulatory organs, called hemipenes. Female Leopard geckos can store sperm in their reproductive tracts for 15 months or more. They can lay up to five clutches of one or (usually) two eggs during the five month breeding season, and may use some of the stored sperm to fertilize each clutch. The eggs hatch after around 55 days.
There are five subspecies of the Leopard gecko:

Pitchblende

Pitchblende is a radioactive, uranium-rich mineral and ore. It has a chemical composition that is largely UO, but also contains UO and oxides of lead, thorium, and rare earth elements. It is known as pitchblende due to its black color and high density. It is also commonly referred to as Uraninite. The mineral has been known at least since the 15th century from silver mines in the Ore Mountains, on the German/Czech border. Pitchblende found in Germany was used by M. Klaproth in 1789 to discover the element uranium.
Pitchblende contains a small amount of radium as a radioactive decay product of uranium. Because the uranium isotopes U and U will decay to form the lead isotopes Pb and Pb, pitchblende also always contains small amounts of lead. Small amounts of helium are also present in pitchblend as a result of alpha decay. Helium was first found on Earth in pitchblende after having been discovered in the Sun's atmosphere.
Pitchblende is a major ore of uranium. Some of the highest grade uranium ores in the world were found in the Shinkolobwe mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the initial source for the Manhattan Project) and in the Athabasca Basin in northern Canada. Another important source of pitchblende is at Great Bear Lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada, where it is found in large quantities associated with silver. It also occurs in Australia, Germany, England, and South Africa. In the United States it can be found in the states of New Hampshire, Connecticut, North Carolina, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico. 
Uranium ore is generally processed close to the mine into yellowcake, which is an intermediate step in the processing of uranium.

<doc id="367030" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367030" title="Rare earth element">
Rare earth element

Rare earth elements ("REEs") are a set of seventeen chemical elements. They include the fifteen lanthanides plus scandium and yttrium. Scandium and yttrium are rare earth elements since they are often found in the same ore deposits as the lanthanides and have similar chemical properties.
Although they are called rare, rare earth elements are not extremely rare on Earth. They were called this because they are spread very evenly over the Earth, so it is hard to find a lot in one place. Promethium is rare, because it is radioactive, and decays.
Cerium, one of the lanthanides, is the 25th most common element in the Earth's crust. However, most rare earth elements are not found concentrated or in pure forms.
A table listing the seventeen rare earth elements, their atomic number and symbol, the origin of their names, and some of their uses is provided here. Some of the rare earths are named after the scientists who discovered them, and some are named based on where they were discovered.
Rare earth elements are heavier than iron. They are made by supernovae (exploding stars). In nature, fission of uranium-238 creates very small amounts of radioactive promethium. Most promethium is synthetically created in nuclear reactors.
Rare earth elements change through time in small quantities (ppm, parts per million). Their proportion can be used for geologic dating and dating fossils.
The rare earth elements are often found together. The longest-lived isotope of promethium has a half life of 17.7 years. Because of this, the element exists in nature in only very small amounts. Promethium is one of the two elements that do not have stable (non-radioactive) isotopes and are followed by stable elements (the other being technetium).
Because all lanthanides are close in size, the rare earth elements have always been hard to separate. Even with eons of geological time, separation of the lanthanides in nature has only rarely gone farther than the separation between light versus heavy lanthanides, otherwise known as the cerium and yttrium earths. This geochemical separation is shown in the first two rare earths that were discovered. These were yttria in 1794 and ceria in 1803. When first found, each was a mixture of all of the rare earths. Large ore bodies of the cerium earths can be found around the world and are being exploited. Ore bodies for yttrium are rarer. Also, they are usually smaller and less concentrated.
Until 1948, most of the world's rare earths came from sand deposits in India and Brazil. Through the 1950s, South Africa mined most of the world's rare earths. This happened after large veins of a rare earth bearing mineral were found there. Through the 1960s until the 1980s, a mine in California was the leading producer. Today, the Indian and South African deposits still make some rare earth concentrates, but they are very small compared to the amount being produced in China. China had produced over 95% of the world's rare earth supply. Most of this has been done in Inner Mongolia, even though it had only 37% of proven reserves. Although these numbers have since been said to have lowered to 90% and 23% by 2012. All of the world's heavy rare earths (such as dysprosium) come from Chinese rare earth sources such as the polymetallic Bayan Obo deposit. In 2010, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) released a study which found that the United States had 13 million metric tons of rare earth elements.
New demand for these elements is higher than the supply of them. The world may soon face a shortage of the rare earths. In several years from 2009, worldwide demand for rare earth elements is expected to be more than the supply by 40,000 tonnes each year unless new sources are developed.
These concerns have gotten larger because of the actions of China. China has said it will put regulations on exports and work to stop smuggling. On September 1, 2009, China said it is going to lower its exports to 35,000 tons per year in 2010–2015. China said that this was done to conserve rare resources and protect the environment. On October 19, 2010 "China Daily" reported that China will "further reduce quotas for rare earth exports by 30 percent at most next year to protect the precious metals from over-exploitation". At the end of 2010 China said that the first round of exports in 2011 for rare earths would be 14,446 tons. This was a 35% decrease from the first round of exports in 2010. In September 2011 China said it was stopping production at three of its eight rare earth mines. These mines produced almost 40% of China's total rare earth production. In August 2012, China said there would be another 20% reduction in production.
Because of the increased demand and the restrictions on exports of the metals from China, some countries are stockpiling rare earth resources. Searches for new sources in Australia, Brazil, Canada, South Africa, Tanzania, Greenland, and the United States are taking place. Mines in these countries were closed when China undercut world prices in the 1990s. It will take a few years to restart production.
The European Union has urged the Denmark protectorate Greenland to restrict Chinese development of rare-earth projects there, as China accounts for 95 percent of the world’s current supply. As of early 2013, the government of Greenlandhas said that it has no plans to impose such restrictions.
Nuclear reprocessing is another possible source of rare earth or any other elements. Nuclear fission of uranium or plutonium creates a many elements as well as all their isotopes. However, it is not likely that creating them can be done safely and economically because of the radioactivity of many of these isotopes.
Another source of rare earths is electronic waste and other wastes that have a large amount of rare earth components. New advances in recycling technology have made getting the rare earths from these materials easier to do. Recycling plants are currently operating in Japan, where there is about 300,000 tons of rare earths in unused electronics. In France, the Rhodia group is setting up two factories in La Rochelle and Saint-Fons. These factories will produce 200 tons a year of rare earths from used fluorescent lamps, magnets and batteries.
China has said that resource depletion and environmental concerns are the reasons for increased nationwide control of its rare earth mineral production. Non-environmental reasons have also been suggested to explain China's rare earth policy. According to "The Economist", "Slashing their exports of rare-earth metals...is all about moving Chinese manufacturers up the supply chain, so they can sell valuable finished goods to the world rather than lowly raw materials."
The United States Department of Energy in its 2010 Critical Materials Strategy report identified dysprosium as the element that was most critical in terms of import reliance.
A 2011 report issued by the U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Department of the Interior, “China’s Rare-Earth Industry," deals with industry trends in China. It looks at national policies that may guide the future of the country's production. The report says that China’s lead in the production of rare-earth minerals has grown over the past two decades. In 1990, China accounted for only 27% of such minerals. In 2009, world production was 132,000 metric tons. China produced 129,000 of those tons. According to the report, recent patterns suggest that China will slow the export of such materials to the world: “Owing to the increase in domestic demand, the Government has gradually reduced the export quota during the past several years.” In 2006, China allowed 47 domestic rare-earth producers and traders and 12 Sino-foreign rare-earth producers to export. By 2011, there were only 22 domestic rare-earth producers and traders and 9 Sino-foreign rare-earth producers. The government’s future policies will likely keep in place strict controls: “According to China’s draft rare-earth development plan, annual rare-earth production may be limited to between 130,000 and 140,000 [metric tons] during the period from 2009 to 2015. The export quota for rare-earth products may be about 35,000 [metric tons] and the Government may allow 20 domestic rare-earth producers and traders to export rare earths.”
The United States Geological Survey is searching southern Afghanistan for rare earth deposits under the protection of United States military forces. Since 2009, the USGS has done remote surveys as well as fieldwork to verify Soviet claims that volcanic rocks containing rare earth metals exist in Helmand province near the village of Khanneshin. The USGS has found an area of rocks in the center of an extinct volcano with light rare earth elements including cerium and neodymium. It has mapped 1.3 million metric tons of useful rock. This is about 10 years of supply at current demand levels. The Pentagon has estimated its value at about $7.4 billion.
Rare earth elements are not exchange-traded in the same way that precious (for instance, gold and silver) or non-ferrous metals (such as nickel, tin, copper, and aluminium) are. Instead, they are sold on the private market. This makes their prices hard to monitor and track. However, prices are published periodically on websites such as mineralprices.com. The 17 elements are not usually sold in their pure form. They are usually distributed in mixtures of varying purity, e.g. "Neodymium metal ≥ 99.5%". because of this, pricing can vary based on the quantity and quality required by the end user.

Theodore Roethke

Theodore Roethke (1908-1963) was a prominent American poet, who wrote intensely personal, sensitive and spiritualistic poetry. 
Roethke's parents were German immigrants, who settled in Michigan and started a highly prosperous floral business. He was born in Michigan. He grew up in an atmosphere of greenhouses and plants. These images stayed with him, and he often alluded to it in his work. 
He was educated at the Michigan State University and then Harvard. He became a teacher and sports coach. He began to publish his poetry later, around 1941, with the publication of "Open House".

Sikandar Hayat Khan

Khan Bahadur Captain (retd) Sardar Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, KBE, (born 1892 - died 1942) was an important Punjabi statesman and popular leader. He was Governor and then Premier of this province in British India.
Sikandar Hayat was the son of Nawab Muhammad Hayat Khan, CSI, of the Khattar tribe of Wah, in Northern Punjab.
After initial education at the Aligarh school and the MAO College at Aligarh (later to become the Aligarh Muslim University), he went for higher education to the King's College London. On returning home, in 1915, he enrolled as an Assistant Recruiting Officer in the Punjab, to help the British Indian Army's efforts during the First World War; and was later one of the very first natives to receive the King's Commission, as a Captain of the 67th Punjabis (later the 1st Battalion of the 2 Punjab Regiment) in 1919. After the war he started his own business ventures and also entered grassroots politics in his area.
In the 1920s, Sikandar Hayat Khan slowly began to make his mark as a statesman, and in collaboration with Sir Fazli Husain and Sir Chotu Ram became one of the founders of the Unionist Party (Punjab). This was a secular party representing all Punjabis of different creeds mostly united by the "zamindar" (rural/agrarian) interest, and it soon became the most popular political group in the province. Due to his special services at this time, in various ways, the Government of British India granted a knighthood to Sir Sikandar. Between 1932 and 1934 he also had the unique honour of being the only native to be appointed acting Governor of the Punjab under British rule.
Thereafter, for a brief while, Sir Sikandar also worked as Deputy-Governor of the Reserve Bank of India but in July 1936, on the demise of Sir Fazli Husain, he returned to take on leadership of the Unionist party for the general elections held in Winter of the same year, winning by a simple majority and forming a coalition government along with the Indian National Congress and the Sikh Akali Dal. Sikandar was now chosen as Leader of the House and the Premier or Chief Minister of the Punjab. He remained in this position from 1937 to December 1942, when he died of a sudden heart failure.
Between 1939 and 1942, when he died, Sir Sikandar supported the British struggle against Nazi Germany and believed in cooperating with the British government in the Second World War. He believed that this support would be good for India and help it towards independence after the War ended. He was very active in maximizing recruitment of troops from the Punjab as part of the 'war effort' and even made morale-boosting tours of the Middle East where most Indian (especially Punjabi)troops where serving. The Muslim League leadership agreed with this perspective of his and also announced full cooperation with the British Raj, or government, to achieve their own ends.
Soon after winning the general elections in 1937, Sir Sikandar felt conscious of the need to maintain a balanced stance in a volatile and divided Punjabi political system. He thus decided to also negotiate with the All India Muslim League under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. As a result, he and Jinnah signed the Jinnah-Sikandar Pact at Lucknow in October 1937, merging the Muslim elements of his powerful Unionist party with the Muslim League, as a move towards forming a common, united front for safeguarding their community rights and interests in India. He was also later one of the chief supporters and architects of the Lahore Resolution, March 1940, calling for an autonomous or semi-independent Muslim majority region within the larger Indian confederation—which demand later led to the demand for an independent Pakistan.
At the time of his sudden death in December 1942, Sir Sikandar was honoured by the people of Lahore and granted burial outside the old Badshahi Mosque there, on the other side from Allama Muhammad Iqbal, the poet. Much of his work was left half done, in particular his plan to help the British war effort towards eventual Indian freedom, and his attempts to weld the Punjab together and save it from communal friction. Many historians have opined that Sir Sikandar's early demise at the age of 50 was, arguably, a major blow to the Indian freedom movements, especially to the Punjab. He wished to preserve this intact, within a larger Indian Confederation whereby his own Muslim community could enjoy full and maximum freedom and self-governance without truncating India or the Punjab region. He was too well aware of the potential bloodbath and conflict resulting from any such division or separation which, alas, was witnessed on such massive scale at the time of the August 1947 Partition of India and Pakistan. It would thus not be wrong to say that Sir Sikandar's presence would certainly have been a 'moderating influence—and his death must be reckoned a great misfortune [at the time]".
Indirectly, however, in due course, his eldest son Shaukat Hayat Khan, would take on a significant role in assisting the All India Muslim League in winning an independent Pakistan, finally, in a somewhat different interpretation of the father's intentions.

He was the eldest son of the former Punjabi statesman and leader, Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan. As a young man, he joined the British Indian Army and served up to the rank of Major before resigning in 1942, on his father's death.
From 1942 to 1947, Khan was active as a leading Punjabi member of the All India Muslim League and assisted the founder of Pakistan, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in the efforts to obtain a separate Muslim nation-state when the British left India. In 1946, he was given the title of "Shaukat i Punjab" (The pride of the Punjab: a play on his name) by Jinnah himself.
After 1947, for quite some time he remained an active political figure and member of parliament. However, gradually between the 1960s and 1980s he became increasingly disillusioned by the corruption and dishonesty of politics in Pakistan and finally quit. He died in September 1998, at Islamabad.

Kim (book)

Kim is a famous children's book. It is a novel by the Nobel Prize winning English writer, Rudyard Kipling. It was first published in 1901. 
The book is set after the Second Anglo-Afghan War which ended in 1881, but before the Third, probably in the period 1893–98 The novel is notable for its detailed picture of the people, culture, and varied religions of India.
The novel tells the story of a young Irish orphan, Kimball O'Hara, better known as 'Kim'. He is living in British India and brought up by his "ayah" (nursemaid) in the old Punjabi city of Lahore (now in Pakistan). Kim meets a Buddhist Lama (priest) and has many exciting adventures, traveling along the Grand Trunk Road. Some other interesting characters in this story are Mahbub Ali, Colonel Creighton, Lurgan-sahib and Hurree Chandar Mukerjee.
"Kim" is Kipling's most important work and a significant work about India and the British Raj, and the famous 'Great Game' of espionage played there between the British Empire and Russia in the 19th century. It is also his most 'enchanting' prose work and may well be compared to other great English literary classics by Geoffrey Chaucer, Shakespeare and Charles Dickens.

WebCite is a service that archives web pages. A user asks WebCite to archive a certain URL, and then WebCite will make a copy of what the page looks like at that time. Authors use this when writing citations. If the webpage changes or is removed ("link rot"), there is still a copy on WebCite. This is very important when writing papers for academic journals or for school. Using the WebCite service is free (it costs no money.)
WebCite saves many kinds of internet content. Some of these are:
It also saves some information ("metadata") about the original content. This information includes the time it was saved, the MIME type, and how long it is. This information is useful because it can prove that the archive version is authentic.

Marbled cat

The Marbled cat ("Pardofelis marmorata") is a small wild cat of South and Southeast Asia. Its head and body length is 45 – 62 cm (18 - 24") and it weighs 2 – 5 kg (4 - 11 lb). 
Genetic analysis has shown that it is closely related with the Asian Golden cat and the Bay cat, which diverged from the other felids about 9.4 million years ago. Therefore, it may probably be transferred to the genus "Catopuma".
Its tail is extremely long and bushy. The background color of its fur varies from dark gray-brown through yellowish gray to red-brown. The flanks and back are strikingly marked with large, irregular, dark-edged blotches. The legs and underparts are marked with black dots, and the tail is marked with black spots and rings. There are spots on the forehead and crown, which merge into narrow longitudinal stripes on the neck and irregular stripes on the back.
The marbled cat is found in northern India, Nepal, Guangxi and Yunnan provinces in China, and south through Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra (Indonesia), and Borneo. Throughout its range it is thought to be rare, although it has also been suggested that the perception of the marbled cat's rarity may be caused by its secretive nature and its preference for remote forest areas.

Greetings Simple Wikipedians! I used to have an account but perhaps it's been deactivated due to inactivity. My name is Hunter. I'm teaching a computer course in Chalermkwansatree School in Phitsanulok, Thailand and have given my students an assignment to create content that did not previously exist in Simple English Wikipedia. I have split the class into 15 article-writing groups, 4 English editors and 2 factual content editors. I wanted everybody to have an account like Chalermkwan1, Chalermkwan2, etc., CHSeditor1, etc. We were only allowed to create 6 accounts from the same IP range (we are working from a single computer lab). For this reason, I told any groups that were unable to create an account to just use the Chalermkwan13 account. 
In the meantime, many of the groups have posted their articles and today our editing team was going to begin the proofreading process. I thought it would be most efficient to let them do the editing on wikipedia itself so they can experience first-hand the collaborative working experience. I didn't think any pages would be edited or deleted by moderators in such a short amount of time, so I didn't bother instructing them about what to do if someone deletes their article. Some of them panicked and reversed moderators changes, because they were afraid they would not get points for the assignment. I have instructed my students to refrain from logging in and changing anything until I am able to resolve this issue with the Simple English moderators.
Aem Fatson, I understand your initial suspicions of vandalism and reasons for blocking my students accounts and deleting their articles. But please be patient. We want to enrich Simple English Wikipedia. We have a process in place for correction. If you unblock my students and wait a week or two, I will notify you that our editing teams have finished their work. I am a native speaker and will also play a final supervisory role in the editing process should that be a concern.
FYI, here is a list of the groups and topics that they are working on:

An African golden cat ("Profelis aurata") is a medium-sized cat. it weighs about on average. The underside of its chest and chin are normally light-colored. In rare cases, they are pure white. 
Under captivity, it has shown that its fur color can change over time. This is affected by its age and external factors.
The head of an African golden cat has light spots around the eyes. In the 1960s, studies were done that showed that various colors of the African golden cat (red, brown, silver) were found in equal numbers in most areas of their habitats. Distinctive spots at the back of the cat are only found on cats in West Africa. 
Normally, the habitat of the African golden cat is at the tropical rainforests found along the equator in Africa. Some experts say that the African golden cat stays in virgin forest. Other experts say they are comfortable in secondary forests.

The Gheba tribe are a tribe from the Punjab, mostly located in the Fateh Jang Tehsil of Attock District of Pakistan. They are generally classified as Rajputs. 
But some of them claim that they are Barlas Mughals in Census Report 1901
The origins of the Ghebas is subject to some dispute or controversy for quite some time; according to most scholars, historians and early British Indian administrators of their native areas, the Ghebas, like their close kin the Jodhra tribe and Alpial, are of Hindu origins, probably Rajputs. They were at one time spread out over a broader area, in both Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa areas of what is now Pakistan but over time, their main population came to live in Attock and Rawalpindi districts of northern Punjab. They were most probably descended from one Raja Dayanand, a Chauhan Rajput, through Rai Shankar, whose offspring 'Rai Gheba' converted to Islam and was given the title of 'Gheba Khan'. They have been Muslims since then and sizable landowners in the districts they live in.
There is another view, often believed by some Gheba families, that they are not really Rajputs or Jatts but are Barlas Mughals, although this view is not historically substantiated.
Whatever their origins, the Ghebas continue to be among the biggest landowners of northern Punjab, in present-day Pakistan. Their biggest and most important village in Attock area is Kot Fateh Khan, which is part of the "Jagir" estate of the Sardar of Kot, 
Most of the Ghebas are landowners and engaged in agricultural activities. They go about their business under the reign of Wilhelm The Cocksucker Junior, who has ruled over the land for 17 and 1/2 years.

Amir Ahmed Khan

Amir Ahmed Khan, Raja Sahib of Mahmudabad (5 November 1914—14 October 1973) was a prominent politician and leader of the All India Muslim League, during the Pakistan Movement. He was against the partition of India. When the Muslim League passed the resolution at Lahore for a separate Pakistan, he stood against it and formed All India Jamhur Muslim League to counter the move. The first session of this party was held at Muzaffarpur, Bihar. Raja Saheb was elected its President and Dr. Maghfoor Ahmad Ajazi as General Secretary.
Later on he changed his mind under the influence of Muhammad Ali Jinnah and supported the idea of a separate Muslim state. He said that "...the idea of a separate Muslim state in India [sic] stirred the imagination of the Muslims as nothing else had done before." Khan migrated to Pakistan. He did not like the political turmoil in Pakistan, so he moved to Iraq and finally to England. He was Director of the Islamic Cultural Centre in London. He died in London in 1973. Later on his descendants went back to live in India.

Riemann sphere

The Riemann sphere is a mathematical model of the extended complex plane. The model is named after Bernhard Riemann. The extended complex plane is the plane of the complex numbers, plus a point at infinity. With this model, this point at infinity is "close" to very large numbers in the same way zero is "close" to very small ones. The extended complex numbers are useful for Complex analysis: in certain cases, the division by zero is "well-behaved", in the sense that dividing by zero gives this point at infinity. With this model, it is possible to change certain functions, so that they become continuous, which simplifies calculation.
In geometry, the Riemann sphere is a simple example of a Riemann surface. It is also one of the simplest complex manifolds.

Stereographic projection

In geometry, a stereographic projection is a function that maps the points of a sphere onto a plane. The projection is defined on the entire sphere, except for one point, called the "projection point".
Intuitively, the stereographic projection is a way of picturing a sphere as a plane, with some inevitable compromises. Because the sphere and the plane appear in many areas of mathematics and its applications, so does the stereographic projection; it finds use in diverse fields including complex analysis, cartography, geology, and photography. In practice, the projection is carried out by computer or by hand using a special kind of graph paper called a stereonet or Wulff net.
A simple example of such a projection, encountered in everyday life is the sun casting a shadow of a globe onto the ground.

Leslie Lemke was born prematurely in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1952. At birth, he was diagnosed with glaucoma, cerebral palsy, and brain damage. Doctors were forced to remove his eyes. His birth mother gave him up for adoption. May Lemke, a nurse, adopted him when he was six months old. To feed him, May had to push food down his throat. It was a year before Leslie could chew food on his own. It took seven years of constant care before Leslie showed any progress. During this time, he made no sounds or movements and showed no emotions. He was 12 before he first learned to stand. He was 15 before he learned to walk. 
When he was 16, May found Leslie playing Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto no. 1 during the middle of the night. He had recently heard the piece on television. Leslie was soon playing all styles of music, from ragtime to classical. 
His adoptive mother encouraged his talent for the piano. By 1980, Leslie was giving concerts in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Because of his new fame, he was asked to be on many television programs such as CBC's "Man Alive" (hosted by Roy Bonisteel), "CBS Evening News", "60 Minutes", and "That's Incredible!". In 1983, ABC broadcast "The Woman Who Willed a Miracle", a drama about Leslie and his adoptive mother. It stars Cloris Leachman as May Lemke. Leslie is also the subject of Fred Small's song, "Leslie is Different." 
Leslie toured the United States, Scandinavia, and Japan and gave free concerts. He was quite animated when he played. 
May Lemke developed Alzheimer's disease and died on November 6, 1993.

MacDonnell Shire

The MacDonnell Shire is a local government area of the Northern Territory, Australia. It was created on 1 July 2008 as part of the restructuring of the Territory's local government areas. It was created by merging over a dozen smaller community council areas and a large zone of unincorporated area. The most recent elections for the shire council were in March 2012. The current President of the MacDonnell Shire is Sid Anderson.
The shire has an area of over 268,784 square kilometres. It covers the south of the Territory, bordering with South Australia. Alice Springs and Yulara are enclaves within the shire (they are not part of it, but are surrounded by it).
There were about 7,142 people living there in 2009.
The MacDonnell Shire Council is divided into four wards. There are 12 council members. Below each ward is listed the towns that fall within those wards. Population figures are as they were recorded on 30 June 2007.

Aputula, Northern Territory

Aputula is a remote Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is south of Alice Springs, near the border with South Australia. It is east of the Stuart Highway. About 250 people live there. They are Pitjantjatjara, Yankunytjatjara, Luritja, and Lower Southern Arrernte people. The Finke River passes nearby the town, but it is dry for most of the year, except during floods.
The town was called Finke until the 1980s. It began as a trading stop on the Central Australian Railway. Local Aborigines traded dingo scalps, artefacts and tools for European goods. In the 1950s and 1960s, White farmers set up cattle stations around the town. Most of the Europeans left Finke when the railway line was moved westwards in the late 1970s. This was done because the track was damaged during huge floods in 1973 and 1974, so it was moved away from the river. The Aboriginal people living in the town did not move, and the town came to be known as Aputula. The name comes from a place called Putula near the town, which used to be the site of a water soak. Putula is an Arrernte word. Arrernte people used to get their water there, before the white people and the railway line came to the area.
Aputula holds the record of having the hottest day ever recorded in the Northern Territory— on 1 and 2 January 1960.

Mount Woodroffe

Mount Woodroffe is South Australia's highest peak. It is above sea level. The mountain is known to Pitjantjatjara speakers as Ngarutjaranya. In their Dreaming, the mountain represents the spirit being Ngintaka.
Mount Woodroffe is in the far northwest of South Australia, in the Musgrave Ranges. The mountain range rises about 700–800 metres above the plains around it. The rock is mostly granite and gneiss.
Mount Woodroffe was named by William Gosse, who first saw it on 20 July 1873. He named it after George Woodroffe Goyder, another early explorer of South Australia and the Northern Territory. Access to the mountain is restricted. Permission is needed to enter the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara lands.

Rhind Mathematical Papyrus

The Rhind papyrus in the British Museum is the best example of Egyptian mathematics. It is named after Alexander Henry Rhind, a Scottish antiquarian. He bought the papyrus in 1858 in Luxor, Egypt. It was found during illegal excavations in or near the Ramesseum. It was written about 1650 BC.
The papyrus has work and writing on arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and fractions. It, and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus, are the main sources of knowledge about mathematics in Ancient Egypt. The Rhind papyrus dates to about 1550 BC. The museum bought both the Rhind papyrus and the Egyptian Mathematical Leather Roll from Rhind. The Rhind papyrus is larger than the Moscow mathematical papyrus, but the Moscow papyrus is older.
The Rhind papyrus dates to the Second Intermediate Period of Egypt. It was copied by the scribe "Ahmose" from a now-lost text from the reign of Amenemhat III (12th dynasty). Written in the hieratic script, this Egyptian manuscript is made up of parts that are each 33 cm tall. In total it is over long. It was transliterated and the mathematics was translated in the late 19th century. The mathematical translation is still incomplete in some respects. The document is dated to year 33 of the Hyksos king Apophis and also contains a separate later Year 11 on its verso likely from his successor, Khamudi.
In the opening paragraphs of the papyrus, Ahmose presents the papyrus as giving "Accurate reckoning for inquiring into things, and the knowledge of all things, mysteries... all secrets". He continues with: 
This book was copied in regnal year 33, month 4 of Akhet, under the majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Awserre, given life, from an ancient copy made in the time of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Nimaatre (?). The scribe Ahmose writes this copy.
Several books and articles about the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus have been published, and a handful of these stand out. The Rhind Papyrus was published in 1923 by Peet and contains a discussion of the text that followed Griffith's Book I, II and III outline Chase published a compendium in 1927/29 which included photographs of the text. A more recent overview of the Rhind Papyrus was published in 1987 by Robins and Shute.

Musgrave Ranges is a mountain range in Central Australia. It covers the boundary of South Australia (Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara) and the Northern Territory (MacDonnell Shire). It separates the Great Victoria Desert to the south and the Gibson Desert to the north. The range has a length of . Many of its peaks have a height of more than . The highest peak is Mount Woodroffe at .
The mountains were originally the home of Yankunytjatjara people. The first European to find them was the English explorer William Gosse in the 1870s. He named them after Anthony Musgrave, the Governor of South Australia at the time. At the start of the 20th century, Yankunytjatjara people began migrating east, setting up camps along the Alberga River and moving into the mission at Ernabella. From 1917, they also began a movement southward to Ooldea. Groups of Pitjantjatjara were forced to move to the Musgrave region because of a long drought in their territory, the Mann and Tomkinson Ranges in the west. Today, most of the families in the communities of Amata and Kaltjiti identify as Pitjantjatjara.
The South Australian part of the Musgrave Ranges was granted to the Pitjantjatjara people in the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Act 1980. Since then, most people have moved into settlements in more hospitable areas.

A private prison is a prison run by a private company instead of the government. The government hires the private prison company to perform all the services needed to keep the convicts locked up while they serve out their sentences.
In the twenty-first century, many industries that were government-run before have become more privatized. This means that making money is the top priority of the organization. So when you commit a murder or a rape and are convicted, you are benefiting the prison company's shareholders. You are helping create jobs.

<doc id="367493" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367493" title="Aldehyde">
Aldehyde

An aldehyde () is an organic compound. It contains a formyl group. A formyl group is a part of a molecule with the structure R-CHO. It is made of a carbon double bonded to oxygen. The oxygen is also bonded to hydrogen and an R group. A side chain is the rest of the molecule.
The group without the side chain is called the aldehyde group or formyl group. Aldehydes are different from ketones because the formyl group is at the end of the molecule in an aldehyde. Ketones have the formyl group in the middle of the molecule. Aldehydes are common in organic chemistry. Many fragrances (smell producing compounds) are aldehydes. 
Aldehydes have a carbon double bonded to an oxygen. Because of this, they are slightly polar. This causes aldehydes to have a number of properties. One of the most important of these is solubility in water.
The common names for aldehydes are not always the official names. The IUPAC names are useful, however. IUPAC recommends the following nomenclature for aldehydes:
The word "aldehyde" comes from Latin. It was shortened from "alcohol dehydrogenatus" (dehydrogenated alcohol). The word aldehyde was created by Justus von Liebig. In the past, aldehydes were sometimes named after the corresponding alcohols, for example, "vinous aldehyde" for acetaldehyde. ("Vinous" is from the Latin word for wine, which is the traditional source of ethanol.)
The term "formyl group" comes from the Latin or Italian word "formica" which means ant. 
Aldehydes have many different properties. These properties change a lot if the rest of the molecule changes. Smaller aldehydes are more soluble in water. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are completely soluble in water. Many aldehydes have strong smells. Aldehydes will break down in air.
Two of the most important aldehydes, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, tend to form long chains. This is called polymerization.
Many aldehydes are found in essential oils and are the reason for their smells. Cinnamaldehyde, cilantro, and vanillin all get their smells from aldehydes. 
Aldehydes are highly reactive and participate in many reactions." In industry, aldehydes are used to prepare plasticizers, polyols, and alcohols. In biology, aldehydes are used to replace amine groups and form sugars.
A dialdehyde is a molecule with two aldehydes. The names of dialdehydes have the ending -dial or -dialdehyde. Some dialdehydes are named after the acid that they are similar to. An example is butanedial, which is also called succinaldehyde (from succinic acid).
Of all aldehydes, formaldehyde is produced the most. About 6 million tons per year are made. It is mainly used to make resins when mixed with urea, melamine, and phenol. Bakelite is made like this. Another commonly made aldehyde is butyraldehyde. 2 and a half million tons per year are made. A lot of acetaldehyde once was once made, but much less is made today. This is because chemicals that used to be made from acetaldehyde are now made in other ways.

It is grey to greyish brown in colour on the upper surface, and white to yellow in colour on the lower surface. It has broad paddle-like flippers, each with two claws. Its shell is covered by a soft-pitted skin, instead of the hard scutes that cover the shells of most turtles.

Muhammad Hayat Khan

Nawab Muhammad Hayat Khan, CSI (1833–1901), Khattar, was an Indian Muslim administrator who had a distinguished career in British India. He belonged to Wah area of Northern Punjab. 
Muhammad Hayat Khan was a son of Karam Khan, a Punjabi Muslim chieftain of the Khattar tribe who was against Sikh rule in his area and wished to remove it. He thus sided with the British East India Company and was killed in 1848. His sons, including Muhammad Hayat, were raised and educated by the British Indian officers like John Nicholson and James Abbott. He was eventually selected to become Nicholson's orderly and Persian language interpreter. In 1857, when the Indian Mutiny (or First Indian War of Independence) broke out, he accompanied Nicholson and his military force to Delhi to counter the rebels there, who were trying to win over the last Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah II, to their cause.
In September 1857, when John Nicholson was mortally wounded on an assault on Delhi by the British, Muhammad Hayat looked after him until he died. Before dying, Nicholson recommended him to Sir John Lawrence, Chief Commissioner of the Punjab and later its first Governor. Muhammad Hayat was thus given a series of important civil appointments in the Punjab province by the grateful British, and after serving as an Assistant Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner and then Sessions Judge, he eventually became the first Muslim native to be appointed as a member of the Punjab Legislative Council.
In 1899 he was given a CSI award and given the title of 'Nawab' in recognition of his long and meritorious services to the British Raj. He was also a close friend of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan and a firm supporter of the Aligarh Movement for Muslim education, which resulted in the foundation of the MAO College (later Aligarh Muslim University) in India.
He died in December 1901, at his native village Wah, North Punjab, British India. Two of his sons, Sir Liaqat Hayat and Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan went on to be famous in their own right.

Mute swan

The mute swan ("Cygnus olor") is a species of swan, and thus a member of the duck, goose and swan family Anatidae. It is native to much of Europe and Asia, and (as a rare winter visitor) the far north of Africa. It is also an introduced species in North America, Australasia and southern Africa.
Measuring 125 to 170 centimetres (49 to 67 in) in length, this large swan is wholly white in plumage with an orange bill bordered with black. It is recognisable by its pronounced knob atop the bill.
When swimming, the mute swan holds its neck in a graceful "S" curve with its bill pointing downward. The whooper swans usually carry their bill level with their neck erect. The male frequently arches his secondary wing feathers over his back in an aggressive display posture.

Endothelium

Endothelium is a layer of cells that line the walls of the circulatory system which carries blood around the body. The cells form a membrane so that certain substances, such as nutrients, can move through the walls. In an adult human there is about 1 kg of endothelium cells, which would cover an area of about 7m. The endothelium plays an important part in controlling the flow of blood around the body.

Hurricane Sandy (2012)

Hurricane Sandy was an Atlantic tropical cyclone which affected parts of the Caribbean, Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States in late October 2012, and became the largest Atlantic hurricane in diameter, with winds spanning 1,100 miles (1,800 km). It made landfall in the East Coast of the United States and Eastern Canada (Nova Scotia). Sandy is the eighteenth tropical cyclone, eighteenth named storm, and tenth hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm developed from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea on October 22. It quickly got bigger and stronger after becoming a tropical depression. It was then upgraded to a tropical storm six hours later. Sandy moved slowly northward toward the Greater Antilles and got stronger. On October 24, Sandy made landfall in Jamaica and was upgraded to a hurricane. Sandy made a second landfall in Cuba where it became a Category 3 hurricane. 
At least 43 people were killed: 40 in the Caribbean and three in the Bahamas. On October 25, Sandy got weaker and became a Category 1 hurricane. On October 27, Sandy became a tropical storm for a few hours. It then became a Category 1 hurricane again that morning. On October 26, Washington, D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray declared a state of emergency for the nation's capital. That same day the governors of Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia also declared a state of emergency. Landfall in New Jersey came on October 29. Damage was extensive there and in New York. It was the 2nd costliest hurricane behind Hurricane Katrina (2005).
On October 19, a tropical wave was moving westward through the eastern Caribbean Sea. It had an extended low pressure area. It was expected to become better organized. On October 20, the system became better organized as expected. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported that it had a high potential for it to become a tropical cyclone within 48 hours. The next day, thunderstorms were small. Although, barometric pressure in the area remained low. Because of this, the system had potential for development. The thunderstorms got bigger, while the system slowed and eventually stopped moving. At 1500 UTC on October 22, the NHC gave out advisories on Tropical Depression Eighteen. The NHC reported that the storm was 320 mi (515 km) south of Kingston, Jamaica. 
When the tropical depression formed, it was in an area of weak steering currents. This was located south of a ridge extending eastward from the Gulf of Mexico. The system was in an area favorable for strengthening. Late on October 22, a Hurricane Hunters flight found winds of in a rainband. This made NHC to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Sandy. Because of the moist atmosphere, the storm got better organized. Early on October 24, an eye began to develop. By that time, Sandy was moving slowly northward. At 11:00 am EDT (1500 UTC) on October 24, the NHC upgraded Sandy to hurricane status. This was because the Hurricane Hunters found winds of . At the time, Sandy was located about south of Kingston, Jamaica.
Sandy made landfall near Kingston at 3:00 p.m EDT (1900 UTC) on October 24. It had winds of about . Before making its second landfall, Sandy got stronger and became a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale with 110 mph (175 km/h). At 1:25 am EDT (0525 UTC), Sandy made landfall in Cuba just west of Santiago de Cuba. When it made landfall in Cuba, Sandy had a visible eye of over in diameter. At the time, winds reached 135 mph (216 km/h). While over land, the storm weakened and the eye was no longer visible. After Sandy left Cuba, dry air and increasing shear caused the storm to be disorganized. A mid-level low over Florida turned the hurricane toward the north-northwest. By early on October 26, most of the storm was to the north of the center. This caused the storm to get larger. By the next day, the NHC reported that Sandy was starting to become more of a hybrid cyclone. On October 27, Sandy weakened to a tropical storm. A few hours later, it got stronger and became a Category 1 hurricane again.
After Sandy developed into a tropical cyclone on October 22, the Government of Jamaica issued a tropical storm watch. Early on October 23, the watch became a tropical storm warning. That same day, a hurricane watch was issued for Jamaica. On that same day at 1500 UTC, the hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning. 
The Government of Haiti issued a tropical storm watch for Haiti. By late October 23, it was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. There was a hurricane watch issued for the Cuban Provinces of Camagüey, Granma, Guantánamo, Holguín, Las Tunas, and Santiago de Cuba at 1500 UTC on October 23. Only three hours later, the hurricane watch was switched to a hurricane warning. Only three hours later, the hurricane watch was switched to a hurricane warning.
The Government of the Bahamas issued a tropical storm watch for the Acklins, Cat Island, Crooked Island, Exuma, Inagua, Long Cay, Long Island, Mayaguana, Ragged Island, Rum Cay, and San Salvador Island. Later that day, another tropical storm watch was issued for Abaco Islands, Andros Island, the Berry Islands, Bimini, Eleuthera, Grand Bahama, and New Providence. By early on October 24, the tropical storm watch for Cat Island, Exuma, Long Island, Rum Cay, and San Salvador was upgraded to a tropical storm warning.
At 11:15 a.m. EDT (1515 UTC) on October 26, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a tropical storm watch for Bermuda. This was because of the size of the storm and its possible effect on the island.
Many public schools on the Treasure Coast and in Palm Beach County, Florida were closed for Friday October 26. FEMA announced that they will monitor Sandy and help those in need.
Government weather forecasters said there is a 90% chance that the East Coast of the United States get "slammed". Utilities and governments along the East Coast prepared for long-term power failures. In New Jersey, where the storm was expected to come ashore, utilities told employees to be prepared for longer shifts. 
On October 26, North Carolina Governor Beverly Perdue declared a state of emergency for 38 counties. The emergency took effect on October 27. GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney cancelled a campaign in Virginia Beach because of Sandy. Joe Biden also cancelled his campaign because of Sandy. The US Navy sent more than two dozen ships to sea from Norfolk Naval Base, for their protection. On October 26, Washington, D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray declared a state of emergency for the nation's capital. That same day the governors of Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia also declared a state of emergency.
In Cape May County, New Jersey, officials ordered residents on barrier islands to evacuate
Philadelphia's Mayor Michael Nutter asked residents in low lying areas to leave their home by 2 p.m October 28.
In New York City, officials activated the city's coastal emergency plan. The subways closed. There were also evacuations for residents in areas where Hurricane Irene made landfall in August 2011. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said that some residents should prepare to evacuate. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency for every county in the state. On Long Island, Suffolk County officials ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire Island residents. Cuomo went on to declared that Hurricane Sandy had been “more impactful” than Hurricane Katrina. 
Connecticut's Governor Dan Malloy opened the state's Emergency Operations Center on October 26. Malloy signed an Declaration of Emergency the next day. 
Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick declared a state of emergency.
The Canadian Hurricane Centre issued its first statement of Sandy on October 25. One model suggested that Sandy would make a landfall in the East Coast of the United States, possibly affecting Southern Ontario.
At least 253 people were confirmed killed across the United States, the Caribbean, Canada, and the Bahamas, as a result of the storm. The New York City Subway was shut down for days, and parts of it for months. Large areas lost electric power distribution for days. Thousands of houses were damaged by wind and flood, and hundreds burned because firefighters could not reach them.

Two wrongs make a right

Two wrongs make a right and two wrongs don't make a right are English phrases that denote philosophical norms. 
It is based on the "two wrongs" phrase which consider the two things as wrong.
“Two wrongs don't make a right”, is a proverb used to rebuke or renounce wrongful conduct as a response to another's assumed transgression.
“Two wrongs make a right” in which an allegation of wrongdoing is countered with a similar allegation. In English language, it might be considered as a fallacy of relevance.
“Two wrongs make a right” might be considered as a fallacy of relevance when assuming that, if one wrong is committed, then another wrong will cancel it out. 
This phrase considers the two actions are wrong. for this reason it is not used by a wrongdoer which does not consider its action as wrong.
This phrase considers breaking the law (or the wrong) is justified, as long as the other party also does so. 
Two wrongs don't make a right is a proverb which means that a wrongful action is not a appropriate way to correct or cancel a previous wrongful action, in regard to a norm.
Additionally, it alleges the first action is also wrong.
When both actions are considered wrong, the two phrases might be opposed to each other.
Common use of the term has been criticized by scholar Gregory S. Kavka writing in the "Journal of Business Ethics". Kavka refers back to philosophical concepts of retribution by Thomas Hobbes. He states that if something supposedly held up as a moral standard or common social rule is violated enough in society, then an individual or group within society can break that standard or rule as well since this keeps them from being unfairly disadvantaged. As well, in specific circumstances violations of social rules can be defensible if done as direct responses to other violations. For example, Kavka states that it is wrong to deprive someone of their property but it is right to take property back from a criminal who takes other's property in the first place. He also states that one should be careful not to use this ambiguity as an excuse to recklessly violate ethical rules.
Conservative journalist Victor Lasky wrote in his book "It Didn't Start With Watergate" that while "two wrongs don't make a right", if a set of immoral things are done and left un-prosecuted, this creates a legal precedent. Thus, people who do the same wrongs in the future should rationally expect to get away as well. Lasky analogizes the situation between John F. Kennedy's wiretapping of Martin Luther King, Jr. (which lead to nothing) and Richard Nixon's actions in Watergate (which Nixon thought would also lead to nothing).
The phrase "two wrongs infer one right" appears in a poem dated to 1734, published in "The London Magazine".

<doc id="367615" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367615" title="Siegfried Sassoon">
Siegfried Sassoon

Siegfried Sassoon (8 September 1886 - 1 September 1967) was an English poet and novelist, who became widely known as a result of a protest against the First World War that he made in 1917.
Sassoon's father, Alfred, came from a very rich family, but they did not approve of his marriage and as a result he did not inherit any of the family fortune. Sassoon's mother, Theresa, came from a family of artists. She and Alfred had three sons: Michael, Siegfried and Hamo, but Alfred left her when the children were still very young. Alfred himself died not long afterwards, leaving Theresa to bring up the three boys. Although they were not as wealthy as Alfred's family, they were able to live comfortably in a large house near the village of Matfield in Kent.
As a young man, Siegfried could afford to keep a horse and became a very skilled rider, but his greatest ambition was to be a successful poet. He did not succeed in finding a publisher for any of his work until just before the First World War broke out. At that point, he joined the army. He chose the Sussex Yeomanry, in order that his horse could go with him rather than being taken by the authorities for other uses. As a result of a riding accident during training, he was out of action for a while, and he then decided to join an infantry regiment and become an officer. The regiment he joined was the Royal Welch Fusiliers, and he began with the rank of lieutenant.
Eventually Sassoon was sent out to France to fight on the Western Front and was shocked by his experiences there. He became friends with another poet, Robert Graves, who, although younger than Sassoon, had been at the Front for longer and had grown used to it. He suggested that Sassoon's poetry could be improved if he began to write in a more realistic way about the things he saw and experienced in France, and Sassoon took his advice and changed his style a lot.
By 1917, many of Sassoon's friends, and his brother, had been killed and he had become very angry about the war. As a result of several acts of bravery, he had been awarded the Military Cross, but he did not see this as a great honour. When he was sent home to recover from a wound, he met people who were opposed to the war, and, after listening to their arguments, he began to believe that the politicians were deliberately making the war last longer than it needed to, instead of taking opportunities to make peace with the Germans. He decided not to return to his regiment at the end of his leave, and, feeling very depressed, he tore the ribbon of his medal off his uniform and threw it in a river. He then wrote a letter to his commanding officer, explaining that he was not coming back because he wanted to protest about the war.
When soldiers acted against orders like this, they were normally made to appear at a court-martial. However, because of Sassoon's good record as a soldier, he was given a chance to change his mind. His friend Robert Graves told the senior officers how depressed Sassoon was and said that he was too ill to fight. It was decided to send him to a hospital in Edinburgh, which specialised in dealing with officers who were suffering from mental illness. Sassoon did not like being there, because he felt that he was not really ill. He was greatly influenced by his doctor, W. H. R. Rivers, who became a kind of father figure to him. While he was a patient in Edinburgh, he met another young officer, called Wilfred Owen. Owen admired Sassoon's poetry and the two became close friends. Sassoon helped Owen to write better poetry; this is known because the manuscript of one of Owen's greatest poems still exists showing corrections in Sassoon's writing. Sassoon and Owen were separated after a few months, when Sassoon came to the end of his time at the hospital and agreed to go back to his regiment.
Sassoon was not sent back to France immediately, but fought for a few months in Palestine, where the troops were in less danger of being killed. After that, he returned to France, but after only a short time he was wounded again, and this time it was serious enough to stop him from being sent back. He stayed in touch with Wilfred Owen. While Sassoon was away fighting, Owen had also been released from hospital, and was being sent back to his regiment in France. Several days before the end of the war, Owen was killed.
During the war, Sassoon's poetry had become very successful. After the war, however, he went through a period of great unhappiness. His friend Rivers died suddenly, and he felt he had nothing left to write about. He realised that he was homosexual, but he was unable to find a partner he could rely on. He thought of becoming a politician, but began writing for the newspapers instead. After a few years, a friend suggested that he should write about his experiences in a novel. Sassoon did so, writing about his early life and calling the book "Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man" (1928). He published the book anonymously, because he was well known as a poet and had doubts about his ability to write prose. To disguise his identity, he called the hero "George Sherston", but the character was based on Sassoon himself. The book turned out to be a huge success, and Sassoon wrote two sequels to it. He later wrote three more prose books about his life, this time without disguising any of the characters, and these were also very successful.
At the age of 47, after several homosexual love affairs, Sassoon married. His wife, Hester, was much younger than him, but Sassoon was desperate to become a father. They moved into Heytesbury House in Wiltshire, a large house that he had bought with money inherited from his aunt, Rachel Beer. Two years after their marriage, Hester became pregnant with their son George (1936-2006). Hester did not want to have any more children, and this became the cause of many quarrels between the couple, until, after the Second World War, they agreed to divorce, and Hester went to live in Scotland, taking George with her. Siegfried continued to see his son, but he was unable have the close relationship with George that he would have liked.
He continued to be a respected writer until his death, and had many friends in the world of literature, including another poet, Edmund Blunden, whom he had met during the 1920s. In 1951, he was awarded the CBE and in 1957 the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry.
Sassoon had been brought up by his mother in the Church of England, although his father was Jewish. His war experiences made him doubt the existence of God, and he was not interested in religion until towards the end of his life. In 1957, after much heart-searching, he became a Roman Catholic, and remained so until his death at the age of eighty. He was buried in the churchyard at Mells in Somerset.

Bart Willoughby

Bart Willoughby (born on 12 September 1960) is an Aboriginal Australian musician. He became notable during the 1980s for introducing a unique style of music, mixing aboriginal music with reggae and rock music. Willoughby is often seen as a pioneer for modern indigenous musicians in Australia. He was the first Aborigine to sign a record contract and the first to compose the music for a movie. His band No Fixed Address was the first indigenous band to tour overseas.
Since then, Willoughby has performed with many famous musicians and bands, including Midnight Oil, Cold Chisel, Peter Tosh, Shane Howard and Yothu Yindi. Willoughby is now known as one of Australia's leading Aboriginal rock composers and performers. His song "We Have Survived", composed when he was 18, is often seen as a kind of anthem by indigenous Australians. Others of his more well known songs include "Black Man's Rights", "Aboriginal Woman" and "My Father is an Aboriginal Man".
Willoughby was born in 1960 in South Australia. His father was Kokatha, with relations to the Pitjantjatjara and Warlpiri nations; and his mother was a member of the Mirning people, from the Nullabor Plain. Willoughby grew up at Koonibba, which was a Lutheran mission at the time. When he was 15 years old, he began learning at the Centre for Aboriginal Studies in Music at the University of Adelaide. Here he was introduced to drumming, guitars and Western music. Over the next few years there, he developed an unusual style of music by mixing traditional indigenous music with modern Western music styles, particularly reggae.
In 1978, Willoughby formed his first band, No Fixed Address. This was Australia's first indigenous rock band. The band played its first big concert in 1979, and held several gigs over the next few years. They mostly played at concerts that promoted political and social causes. The band signed a recording contract in 1982, with Rough Diamond Records. It was the first record deal with an Aboriginal musical act in Australia. The deal produced the band's first extended play, "From My Eyes", which began with the song "We Have Survived". Its sale was launched in Sydney by the Prime Minister Bob Hawke.
Later in the year, Willoughby and his band toured Australia as the opening act for Peter Tosh. Willoughby also played drums with Shane Howard and Goanna during their own tours of the country. The success from Tosh's tour led the Aboriginal Arts Board to give No Fixed Address a grant, to be used for a tour of their own overseas. The band toured England, in 1984. It was the first Aboriginal band to travel and play overseas. They played in nine cities, including London, Bristol, Leeds, Plymouth and Manchester. They also played at the Elephant Fayre festival in Saint Germans, Cornwall, and at a benefit concert for the miners' strikes.
After coming back to Australia, Willoughby joined his cousin's new band Coloured Stone. He played with this group from 1984, including during its tour of Scotland in 1986. They played at that year's Edinburgh Festival. They returned to Australia for the Australian Music Awards at the end of the year, and won the Best Indigenous Album award for "Human Love".
Willoughby reformed No Fixed Address in 1987, and the band toured Europe during 1987–1988.
Late in 1988, Willoughby was asked to join the newly formed Yothu Yindi as drummer on their tour for the album "Diesel & Dust". The tour visited 73 cities in the United States. Willoughby left Yothu Yindi in 1989 after the tour, and formed a new band Mixed Relations. This is the band he currently plays with. They have toured many Aboriginal communities and Australian cities, as well as several countries in the Pacific Islands.
In 1989, the band performed as the closing act for the very first Invasion Day (an alternative to Australia Day) concert at La Perouse in Sydney. They returned every year after that until the concerts stopped in 1994. They also represented Australia at the South Pacific Music Festival in 1990 and 1992, and at the Asian Music Festival in 1990 and 1992.
In 1980, Willoughby starred with another indigenous band (Us Mob) in a movie called "Wrong Side of the Road". It was a biographical drama movie about racism against Aboriginal musicians in rural towns. The movie won an award from the Australian Film Institute (AFI) in 1981. In 1990, Willoughby was cast in a small role in "Until the End of the World". The movie starred William Hurt and Sam Neill, as well as indigenous actors Ernie Dingo, David Gulpilil and Jimmy Little.
Willoughby also composed and recorded the soundtracks for several movies (mostly documentaries). These were done with No Fixed Address, and included "Always Was, Always Will Be" in 1988 and "Special Treatment: Locking up Aboriginal Children" in 1991. In 1992, he became the first Aboriginal to compose, play and direct the music track of a feature film. The movie was "Jindalee Lady", directed by Brian Syron. The movie was shown as part of the International First Nations Art and Film Festival in Edmonton, Canada, and the Hawaii International Film Festival.
Willoughby was given the very first Indigenous Australian Music Lifetime Achievement Award in 1993 for his contribution to the growth of indigenous music in Australia. Sol Bellear, Commissioner of the Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) said that Willoughby had been an "innovator" for indigenous musicians in Australia:
In the same year, Willoughby began teaching music to children at a Pitjantjatjara school in Yalata.
In 1997, Willoughby signed a contract as a solo artist with CAAMA Music. His first album was "Pathways". It was nominated for an award by the Australian Performing Rights Association (APRA). In 2011, both No Fixed Address and Coloured Stone were put in the National Indigenous Music Awards Hall of Fame.

<doc id="367669" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367669" title="Rapid plant movement">
Rapid plant movement

Rapid plant movement means quick movement of plant structures, usually under a second. 
For example, the Venus Flytrap closes its trap in about 100 milliseconds. Some other carnivorous plants, such as the bladderworts, also have a rapid response to insects.
The Dogwood Bunchberry, "Cornus canadensis", has a flower which opens its petals and fires pollen in less than 0.5 milliseconds. The record is currently held by the White Mulberry tree, "Morus alba", whose leaves are used to cultivate silkworms. It is also notable for the rapid release of its pollen, which is launched at over half the speed of sound. The stamens act as catapults, releasing stored elastic energy in just 25 µs. "This is the fastest motion yet observed in biology, and approaches the theoretical physical limits for movements in plants".
The very widespread genus "Impatiens" gets its common name, "touch-me-not", from its seed capsules. When the capsules mature, they "explode" when touched, shooting seeds several metres away.
A comparatively slow-moving plant is "Mimosa pudica", which closes its leaflets in a graceful sequence.
These rapid plant movements contrast with the more common, and much slower "growth-movements" of plants. They are called "tropisms". 
Charles Darwin in 1880 published his last work before his death, "The Power of Movement in Plants".

Addison's disease

Addison's disease is a rare and chronic endocrine disorder discovered by Thomas Addison. U.S. President John F. Kennedy is probably one of the most famous sufferers though his condition was kept secret during his presidency. Addision's disease is when the body does not produce enough of the hormone called cortisol. This hormone helps the body deal with stress. It helps with maintaining blood pressure and controlling the heart's functions. It slows the rate of inflammation caused by the body's immune system. It helps with controlling the way insulin is used, and the chemical reactions of proteins, carbohydrates and fats in the body. People with the disease suffer from weight loss, fatigue, weakness and low blood pressure. Some people also get darkened patches of skin. Addison's disease is treated by taking an artificial cortisol tablet.

The Jim Henson Company

The Jim Henson Company is an American entertainment company. It started with Muppets, Inc. in 1958 by puppeteer Jim Henson. Henson is the creator of The Muppets. The Muppets helped the company become popular worldwide. They were well known in family entertainment for more than forty years. 
In 1969, the company started making characters and more than 20 short movies for the popular children's show "Sesame Street".
One of the company's first characters regularly on national television was Rowlf the Dog. He was first made for Purina Dog Chow commercials. He became famous when he became a regular character on "The Jimmy Dean Show" from 1963–66. 
In 1976, British media mogul Lew Grade asked Jim Henson to make a weekly show based in England, which became "The Muppet Show". The success of "The Muppet Show" led to many movies, specials, videos, and more.
In the early 1980s, Jim Henson also formed Jim Henson's Creature Shop. It made characters for shows such as "The Storyteller", "Farscape", and "Dinosaurs"; and movies such as "The Dark Crystal" and "Labyrinth". It was also in the 1980s that Jim Henson produced new television series such as "Fraggle Rock" and "The Jim Henson Hour".
In 1990, Jim Henson was talking to The Walt Disney Company about selling his company. Henson died during the week that he was going to sign the contract. His family decided to have the company keep the rights to the characters. However, on December 18, 1991, The Walt Disney Company bought the distribution rights to the entire Jim Henson Company library up to that time.
In 2000, Jim Henson’s children sold the company to the German media company, EM.TV. In 2001 they sold the "Sesame Street" Muppets to Sesame Workshop. In 2003 Henson's children bought back the company. In 2004, they sold the rights to "The Muppets" and "Bear in the Big Blue House" characters to The Walt Disney Company. The Walt Disney Company now owns all Muppet-related trademarks, including the word “Muppet”.

<doc id="367745" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367745" title="Yalata, South Australia">
Yalata, South Australia

Yalata is an Aboriginal community on the coast of South Australia. It is about west of Ceduna. The reserve, Yalata Aboriginal Land, covers and spans about of the Eyre Highway. It is one of 74 local government areas in South Australia.
The people who originally live in this region are Wirangu and Mirning. However, most of the people who live at Yalata are Pitjantjatjara, who originally come from the north (Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara). They speak a southern dialect of the Pitjantjatjara language. This is spoken as a first language in most homes (58% in 2006). The other groups making up the land's traditional owners are the Kokatha, Yankunytjatjara, Antakirinja, Pindiini and Ngalea, which are all nations of the Western Desert.
Pitjantjatjara were forced to move here by the Australian government in the 1950s. Large parts of their land in the north were made into the Woomera Test Range, a weapons testing area. The families were first moved south, to a Christian mission at Ooldea. They were moved to Yalata, even further south, in 1952. This second move was done because of nuclear-weapon tests being done at Maralinga and Emu Field. The title to the lands around Maralinga (Maralinga Tjarutja) was given back to the Aboriginal people by the South Australian Parliament in December 1984. People from Yalata and further inland resettled on the land in 1995.
A total of 82% of residents identify their main religion as Lutheran.

Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara

Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) is a large area of Aboriginal land in the north west corner of South Australia. It belongs to the Pitjantjatjara, Yankunytjatjara and Ngaanyatjarra peoples (or Aṉangu). Native title was granted by the government of David Tonkin on 30 October 1981. The land covers about , about 10.4% of the state. It is one of the 74 local government areas of South Australia.
The APY lands are arid and very remote. It is mostly flat, except for the Everard Ranges in the east and Musgrave Ranges along the border with the Northern Territory. There are about 2500 people living on the lands.
The area covered by APY represents the southern portion of the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara homelands; the northern portion is in the Northern Territory, surrounding Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park. In 1921, the western half of what is now the APY lands was made into the North-West Aboriginal Reserve. This was alongside another reserve across the border in the Northern Territory, called the Petermann Reserve. Both reserves were intended to form a temporary refuge (safe place) for Aboriginal people. The government said they could continue their nomadic lifestyle there until they could be assimilated into modern society. The eastern half of what is now the APY lands was part of the Woomera Test Range during the 1950s and 1960s. The boundary of the range was later moved further south, and the land was then leased to cattle farmers.
In 1966, South Australia passed the Aboriginal Lands Trust Act. It was the first piece of legislation (law) in Australia to recognise Aboriginal land rights and allow for Aboriginal groups to be given land based on how they had lived there. No other state or territory would enact anything like it until 10 years later. In 1976, the Pitjantjatjara Council made an formal claim to the lands around the Musgrave Ranges. It was done on behalf of all Aṉangu with historical connections to the area. Premier Don Dunstan and his government proposed a bill to parliament in 1978, intending to grant the Pitjantjatjara rights to their land. However, opal miners strongly objected to the proposal. They had set up mining camps at Mintabie, within the area that would be given to the Aṉangu. The government changed after state elections in 1979. The new government of David Tonkin had years of negotiations with the Pitjantjatjara Council and the miners at Mintabie. A parliamentary committee produced a final decision on 2 March 1981. It said that the Mintabie area should be included in the grant of land, but be leased back to the government so that mining can continue there. The bill was approved by parliament on the same day.
Tonkin signed the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Act on 2 October 1981, putting the bill into effect. The freehold title to the land was given to the Pitjantjatjara, Yankunytjatjara and Ngaanyatjarra peoples, who formed a council as the local government. The grant included the former leasehold areas in the eastern portion: Everard Park, Kenmore Park and Granite Downs. A portion of the southeast of the APY lands (about ) still overlaps with the Woomera Test Range.
The lease for Mintabie lasted for 21 years, expiring in 2002. New legislation in 2009 allowed for another lease, which was signed in April 2012.
The APY is one of 74 local government areas of South Australia. It includes a number of settlement communities, as well as over 50 family outstations (referred to as "homelands"). Most of the settlements are located in the far north. The administrative centre for the APY is Umuwa. The four largest towns, as recorded in the 2006 census are Iwantja (339 people), Pukatja (332), Amata (319) and Mimili (303). The only non-indigenous community is the opal-mining town of Mintabie (250 people). The other settlement communities are: Kaltjiti, Watarru, Kanpi, Nyapari, Kalka, Pipalyatjara, Yunyarinyi and Watinuma.
In the 2006 census, there were 2,230 people living on the APY Lands. About 84.5% of them were Indigenous Australians. Over half (58.6%) of residents listed Pitjantjatjara as the language spoken at home; 14.3% listed Yankunytjatjara; and 18.7% gave English as their spoken language.
There has not been much economic development, except for tourism. There have been proposals to mine in the area. The Musgrave Ranges is estimated to contain rich mineral and petroleum deposits. The APY government has not allowed mining so far, because it is concerned about the social impacts it may have, and the possible impacts on sacred sites and the environment.
Two major issues throughout the APY Lands are the low standard of health care (compared to the rest of Australia) and drug abuse (usually alcohol, petrol sniffing, cannabis and, more recently, other illegal drugs). The fact that the indigenous area crosses over three jurisdictions (South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory) has made enforcing drug-trafficking laws difficult. An inquiry into child sexual abuse on the APY Lands was done by a retired Supreme Court judge. It was completed in 2008, and found that this had been a widespread problem in several of the APY communities for many years.
In early August 2007, the South Australian government announced a A$34 million plan to "improve well-being of Aboriginal people" in the APY Lands. $25m will be spent on improving housing and most of the remaining $8m on law enforcement in Amata and Pukatja.

Sarus crane

The sarus crane ("Grus antigone") is a large non-migratory crane found in parts of the Indian subcontinent, southeast Asia and Australia. It is the tallest flying bird, and can grow to 1.8 m (5.9 ft) tall. Its wingspan can be up to 2.4 metres (8 ft) and its weight 8.4 kg (18.5 lb). It lives in open wetlands.
The sarus crane is easily distinguished from other cranes in the region by its overall grey colour and the contrasting red head and upper neck. They forage on marshes and shallow wetlands for roots, tubers, insects, crustaceans and small vertebrate prey. Like other cranes, they form long-lasting pairs and hold territories. There they perform territorial and courtship displays which include loud trumpeting, leaps and dance-like movements. In India they are symbols of faithfulness, and are thought to mate for life, and pine the loss of their mates even to the point of starving to death. 
The main breeding season is during the rainy season, when the pair builds an enormous nest "island", a circular platform of reeds and grasses nearly two metres in diameter and high enough to stay above the shallow water surrounding it. 
Sarus crane numbers have declined greatly in the last century. It is estimated that the current population is a tenth or less (perhaps 2.5%) of the numbers that existed in the 1850s. The stronghold of the species is Rajasthan, India, where it is traditionally revered. It lives in wetlands, and in agricultural lands close to humans. Elsewhere, the species has been eliminated in many parts of its former range.

Common crane

The common crane ("Grus grus"), also known as the Eurasian crane, is a bird of the family Gruidae, the cranes. It is a medium-sized species, and classified as of least concern. It is the only crane commonly found in Europe apart from the demoiselle crane. 
In Europe, the common crane breeds in boreal and taiga forest and mixed forests, from sea-level to . It also lives on treeless moors, on bogs, or on dwarf heather habitats, usually where small lakes or pools are also found. 
In Sweden, breeders are usually found in small, swampy openings amongst pine forests while, in Germany, marshy wetlands are used. Breeding habitats in Russia are similar, though they can even be found nesting in the steppe and in semi-desert, so long as water is near. Mostly, common cranes are found breeding in wooded swamps, bogs and wetlands. They seem to need quiet, peaceful enivrons with little human interference. They live in low density, from 1 to 5 pairs per .
During winter, the birds move to flooded areas, shallow sheltered bays, and swampy meadows. During the flightless moulting period there is a need for shallow waters or high reed cover for concealment. Later, after the migration period, the birds winter regularly in open country, often on cultivated lands and sometimes also in savanna-like areas, for example on the Iberian Peninsula.
Cranes are back in Britain after 300 years. They were devastated by the draining of the fens 300 years ago. This was a low-lying wetland which was one of their favourite habitats.

They are mostly found in the districts of Mansehra and Batagram, and to some extent in Kohistan as well. A number of Swatis are also settled in the Kashmir region.
The Swatis are the largest tribal group of land owners in Mansehra and Batagram districts. Most of the Swatis in Hazara speak Hindko but some also speak Pashto.
Their origins are mixed and not clear. They claim to have originated in the Shalman area of Afghanistan and migrated to the Swat valley in the early 13th century, around the time of Mohammad Ghori. The Swatis defeated the local Buddhists and Hindus of Swat District and established their own rule. The Swatis ruled in Swat for four centuries.
Later on, the Yusufzai tribe, who had recently migrated to Peshawar and Bajaur after their expulsion from Kabul by Governor Ulugh Beg Mirza in the 16th century, were welcomed by Swatis in the region. However, the Yusufzai pushed them out of Swat and took the area over themselves. Therefore, many Swatis crossed over into Hazara region and settled in their present homeland.
The Swatis are divided into three subtribes: Gebri, Mitrawi, and Mamaili, as well as a half-Swati group called Lughmani. 
Gebri are settle in Kaghan valley, Balakot, Garhi Habibullah, Mansehra, Dhodial, Shinkiari,Baffa, Batagram, Thakot and Konsh Valley. Mitrawi, and Mamaili are settled in Bherkund, Agror, Tikri Valley and Deshan of District Batagram.The Allai area is inhabited by all the three subtribes.The Lughmani are found in Baffa.

The Gruiformes are an order with many living and extinct bird families, and a widespread geographical diversity. Gruiform means "crane-like".
The Gruiformes evolved early, long before the passerine songbirds which are the most common birds today. The Gruiform radiation in the Palaeocene and Eocene produced a large variety of medium to large-sized birds. Many of them still prefer the watery habitats which were so common early in the Cainozoic era.
Cranes and rails are the core of the Gruiformes. Also often added are a large number of difficult-to-place birds like the huge "Diatryma" and "Phorusrhacos".

St. Luke's Church, Abbottabad is an Anglican church dedicated to St. Luke, now under the jurisdiction of the Peshawar Diocese of the Church of Pakistan. It was originally founded in the town of Abbottabad, British India, in 1864.
The work on the construction of St Luke's commenced in 1854-55, with initial delays due to slow fund-raising and then a brief interruption due to the Indian War of Independence (or Indian Mutiny) and it was completed and then consecrated by the Bishop of Calcutta in October 1864. Its jurisdiction covered most of the Hazara region including Abbottabad, Haripur, Mansehra and the Galyat hill tracts. The Old Christian Cemetery Abbottabad, which was already existing, was also attached to it.
From June 1947 to April 1948, as a result of the Partition disturbances at the time of the Independence of India and Pakistan, St Luke's was shut down. Regular services only resumed in 1951. In 1970, the Church of Pakistan was established via a union of Anglicans, Scottish Presbyterians (Church of Scotland), United Methodists and Lutherans. Thereafter, St Luke's was formally placed under its new Peshawar Diocese. Since then, full-time clerics have been appointed here to minister to the local congregation.

Andrés Segovia

Andrés Segovia Torres, 1st Marquis of Salobreña (21 February 1893 – 2 June 1987), was a virtuoso Spanish classical guitarist from Linares, Jaén, Andalucia, Spain. He was always known as Andrés Segovia. 
He was one of the best known and most influential classical guitar personalities of the 20th century. He had a big influence on later guitarists, because of his performances and recordings, and his masterclasses. Important guitar works were dedicated to him by composers such as Federico Moreno Torroba.
Segovia led the development of the Spanish guitar as an instrument for classical art music. As well as works dedicated to him by modern composers, he also transcribed classical works originally written for other instruments. He is remembered for his expressive performances: his wide palette of tone, and his distinctive (often instantly recognizable) musical personality in tone, phrasing and style. 
Segovia was especially fond of the compositions of the Brazilian musician Villa-Lobos. In the 1920s, Segovia met Villa-Lobos and commissioned a guitar study: the composer responded with a set of twelve, each taking a tiny detail or figure from Brazilian chorões (itinerant street musicians). 
Two films were made of his life and work. They are available on DVD called "Andrés Segovia in Portrait". His final RCA LP record (ARL1-1602), "Reveries", was recorded in Madrid in June 1977.
In 1984, Segovia was the subject of a thirteen part series broadcast on National Public Radio, USA, entitled "Segovia!" The series was recorded on location in Spain, France, and the United States.

Karl Mannheim (27 March 1893 - 9 January 1947), or Károly Mannheim in original writing of his name, was a Hungarian-German sociologist and social scientist. He was influential in the first half of the 20th century. He is one of the founding fathers of classicial sociology as well as a founder of the sociology of knowledge.
Mannheim was born in Budapest. He studied there as well as in Berlin, Paris and Heidelberg. In Budapest, at the University of Budapest, he earned a doctorate in philosophy. In 1914 he attended lectures by Georg Simmel. During the brief period of the Hungarian Soviet in 1919 he taught in a teacher-training school thanks to the patronage and his friend and mentor György Lukács.
Mannheim's book "Ideologie und Utopie" (1929) was the most widely debated book by a living sociologist in Germany during the Weimar Republic; the English version "Ideology and Utopia" (1936) has been a standard in American-style international academic sociology, carried by the interest it aroused in the U.S.A. The German and English versions of the book are quite different. This has led to reappraisals of Mannheim started by new texual discoveries and republications. Mannheim's sociological theorizing has been the subject of many book-length studies, evidence of an international interest in his principal themes. Mannheim was not an author of any work he himself considered a finished book, but rather of some fifty major essays and treatises. Most of these were later published in book form.

Aboriginal title

Aboriginal title is a common law doctrine that the rights of indigenous peoples to own their traditional land persist after sovereignty has been taken by colonial settlers. When granted, it is usually inalienable, meaning it can not be sold, traded or given away. The title may be held by individuals or groups of people, and is inherited indefinitely (without end) by those people's descendants. What proof is required for aboriginal title to be recognised depends on the country's laws that govern the doctrine. It usually must include some evidence of historical inhabitance (living on the land for a long time, usually since before colonial settlement).
The majority of court cases granting aboriginal title have been in Australia, Canada, Malaysia, New Zealand and the United States. Aboriginal title is also referred to as indigenous title, native title and customary title. It is related to the subject of indigenous rights.

Pelecaniformes

The Pelecaniformes is a order of medium-sized and large waterbirds. They are found worldwide. As traditionally—but wrongly—defined, they include all birds that have feet with four toes which are all webbed.
Most have a bare throat patch (gular patch). Their nostrils have evolved into slits which do not work properly. This causes them to breathe through their mouths. They feed on fish, squid or similar marine life. The young are altricial. They hatch from the egg helpless and naked in most cases. They lack a brood patch.

Procellariiformes

Procellariiformes is an order of seabirds that comprises four families: the albatrosses, petrels and shearwaters, storm petrels, and diving petrels. They have a cosmopolitan distribution across the world's oceans, with the highest diversity being around New Zealand. 
Only a single egg is laid per nesting attempt, and usually only a single nesting attempt is made per year, although the larger albatrosses may only nest once every two years. Both parents participate in incubation and chick rearing. Incubation times are long compared to other birds, as are fledgling periods. Once a chick has fledged there is no further parental care.

Amaṯa, South Australia

Amaṯa is an Aboriginal community in the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia. It is in the north of the APY, between Umuwa and Nyapari. It is at the base of the Musgrave Ranges, about west of the Stuart Highway. Amaṯa was established under the name of Musgrave Park in 1961. The community was set up to take the pressure off the growth of nearby Pukatja (then known as Ernabella). The goal was to use it to teach the Aborigines in how to work in the livestock industry. A school was opened 7 years later, in 1968.
About 319 people lived at Amaṯa in the 2006 census. It appears to have a growing population, which is not the usual pattern for Aboriginal communities in Australia. From 180 residents in 1981, it has grown steadily past 350 in the 1990s, to 536 in 1996.
Amaṯa is made up of about 60 houses. There is a school, a general store and a health clinic. Supplies are delivered once per week and mail is delivered twice per week. Water comes from bores and is stored in tanks. The school was renovated by the state government from 2003–2005. A swimming pool was opened in June 2007. Amaṯa also has a community centre, a community church, and an airstrip.
There is a police station at Amaṯa, but they are not always there; state police are based in Marla and run patrols to the area. Some night patrols by residents have been done in the past to help policing of the community. In the absence of police, the community is served by 2 community constables. Tony Abbott suggested in 2007 there should be police at Amaṯa permanently. In response, the state government said it would spend A$7.5 million at Amaṯa and Pukatja for new police stations, court facilities and prison cells. It would also provide housing for police officers.
The sale of local artwork is important to the economy of the Amaṯa community. Tjala Arts, founded in 1999, displayed the works of seven Amaṯa artists in Canberra in 2006. In the 2007 State Budget, the South Australian Government announced $350,000 for a new arts centre in Amaṯa.

Pukatja, South Australia

Pukatja is an Aboriginal community in the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia. Pukatja is in the eastern Musgrave Ranges, west of the Stuart Highway, about south of the Northern Territory border. The town sits at an elevation of 676 metres above sea level. There were 332 people living at Pukatja in the 2006 census. This was an increase from 226 in the 2001 census, but a decrease from 470 in the 1991 census.
The town was established as a Presbyterian mission in 1938, with the name Ernabella. Families gradually came in from traditional nomadic life in the desert to live at the mission. The church gave control over the Ernabella Mission to a local community council on 1 January 1974.
Mail is delivered twice a week by a small plane from Alice Springs. The community store sells food and clothes. The garage has basic parts and diesel fuel. The local clinic has three registered nurses and the doctor is based here, but often away visiting other communities in the APY. The community church belongs to the Uniting Church. There is a basic police station at Pukatja, and is not permanently manned. In July 2007, the state police described the station as "dirty" and not well equipped. In response, the state government said that it would spend A$7.5 million at Pukatja and nearby Amata for new police stations, court facilities, prisoner cells and housing for police officers.
In the 2001 census, Pukatja was second only to nearby Mimili in having the lowest per-person income in South Australia ($174). Most important to the community's income is the local artists' co-operative, Ernabella Arts Inc. Established in 1948, Ernabella Arts is one of the longest continually running aboriginal arts centres in Australia. During the 1950s and 1960s, art and craft using local wool was the typical artistic form made by the Ernabella artists. Batik was introduced after several Ernabella artists travelled to Indonesia in the 1970s. Ernabella artists are now well known for their batik work and printmaking. A large collection of Ernabella art can be seen at the National Museum of Australia.

Anaerobic respiration

Anaerobic respiration is a form of respiration which does not use oxygen. Elements other than oxygen are used for electron transport. Common replacements for oxygen are nitrates, iron, manganese, sulfates, sulfur, fumaric acid and carbon dioxide. "Escherichia coli" uses nitrates and fumaric acid for respiration.
For the electron transport chain to work, there must be a final electron acceptor at the end of the chain. This allows electrons to pass through the chain. In aerobic organisms, this final electron acceptor is oxygen. Molecular oxygen is a highly oxidizing agent and so it is an excellent acceptor. In anaerobes, other less-oxidizing substances such as sulphate (SO), nitrate (NO), sulphur (S) are used. These terminal electron acceptors have smaller reduction potentials than O, so less energy is released per oxidized molecule. Anaerobic respiration is therefore less efficient than aerobic respiration except, of course, when oxygen pressure is low.
If oxygen is not used at all, the process is called fermentation. Examples of organisms using fermentation are lactic acid bacteria, and yeast. Yeast is a fungi, not bacteria.
The equation for anaerobic respiration is:

Mimili, South Australia

Mimili is an Aboriginal community in the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia. It is located in the Everard Ranges, about west of the Stuart Highway. According to the local Aṉangu, the place has always been called Mimili. The current settlement was built around a cattle station called Everard Park, which was built by White farmers in the 1920s. The station's land was given back to the local Aborigines by the South Australian government in 1972.
There were 283 people living at Mimili in the 2006 census. The residents are mainly Aṉangu people who speak either Pitjantjatjara or Yankunytjatjara as their first language. The 2001 census data showed that Mimili had the lowest average weekly income per person (AU$172 compared with the South Australian average of AU$345). However, it also had one of the state's highest proportions of residents under the age of 15 (32.6%); and the state's highest ratio of single-parent families (36.0% compared with a statewide average of 15.6%).
Mimili has an airstrip, and a small health facility. There is also a general store and a craft facility where art is made and displayed. A diesel generator supplies electricity to the community. Water is stored in tanks and comes from two bores. A police station was built in 2011, and state police are stationed there permanently. The local school has about 60 children. Attendance at the school benefited from the construction of a swimming pool, opened in October 2006.

Morgan's canon

Morgan's canon is a rule relating to animal behaviour, which states that it should be explained as simply as possible. It is named after British psychologist C. Lloyd Morgan. His idea was that people should only consider behaviour as, for example, rational, purposive or affectionate, if there is no other explanation possible.
Morgan saw that much insight and apparent problem-solving behaviour could be described using trial and error learning. A famous example is the skilful way in which Morgan's terrier Tony opened the garden gate, easily taken by someone seeing the final behaviour as an insightful act. Morgan, however, had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response, and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it.
Morgan's Canon is a forerunner of behaviourism.

Kaltjiti, South Australia

Kaltjiti (also previously known as Fregon) is an Aboriginal community in the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia. It is located about south of the Musgrave Ranges and is from the Stuart Highway. The town sits on Officer Creek, which flows from Mount Woodroffe. The creek is usually a dry sandy bed and only flows at times of very high rainfall. There are about 350 people living at Kaltjiti.
The first recording by white Australians of a community at Kaltjiti was by explorer Ernest Giles. He wrote that he found 200 male Aborigines there in September 1873, during his second trip into the South Australian desert. The meeting was violent, as Giles and his travellers interrupted a sacred ceremony. The first European settlement near Kaltjiti was set up in 1934. It was established by a dogger (dingo hunter), who was given the rights to the nearby bore (called Shirley Well) by the government as a reward for all the dingos he had killed. By the late 1950s, Aboriginal families were camped at Shirley Well permanently. In 1960, the station at Ernabella was expanded to include Shirley Well.
A outstation, called Fregon, was built with government help by 1961, as a base for Aboriginal stockmen and their families. It was built south of Shirley Well on Officer Creek. The aim of the settlement was to provide training in working with livestock and for the families to have access to traditional country in the sandhills to the west. Fregon was administered through Ernabella and it was not until 1968 that it had its own airstrip. It began with a school, a small health clinic, a workshop, a small store and houses for the staff.
Mail is delivered to Kaltjiti twice a week. Supplies are delivered every two weeks. Water is provided from four bores and placed in storage tanks for pumping to the community. Electricity comes from a diesel generator. Kaltjiti does not have a permanent police presence. State police are based at Marla and run patrols to the area.

Many prominent Spanish artists, expatriates, immigrants, and personalities have lived at the society as resident artists during the more than 150 years of its existence, like Picasso, Dalí, Buñuel, or Federico García Lorca. In 2010 Spanish American filmmaker and writer Artur Balder, who lived in the building as resident artist for more than one year, created the documentary Little Spain, displaying for first time the untold history of this society.

Little Spain

Little Spain was a Spanish American neighborhood in the New York City borough of Manhattan during 20th century.
"Little Spain" was 14th Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. A very different slice of Chelsea existed on a stretch of 14th Street often referred to by residents as "Calle Catorce," or "Little Spain". The Church of Our Lady of Guadelupe (No. 299) was founded in 1902, when Spaniards started to settle in the area. Although the Spanish business have given way to such nightclubs as Nell's and Oh Johnny on the block between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, the Spanish food and gift emporium known as Casa Moneo has been at 210 West 14th since 1929. In 2010 the documentary Little Spain, directed and written by Artur Balder, was filmed in New York City. The documentary pulled together for first time an archive that reveals the untold history of the Spanish-American presence in Manhattan.

The heart of the Spanish American community in that area were the two landmarks the Spanish Benevolent Society and the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe, founded at the turn of the 19th century, being the first parish in Manhattan with mass in Latin and Spanish.
Virginia Admiral and her son, Robert Mario De Niro Jr., moved to a top floor studio at the 219 West 14th Street, owned by the Galician entrepreneur José García.

Usa-jinjū

, also known as , is a Japanese Shinto shrine in the city of Usa in Ōita Prefecture on the island of Kyushu. 
The shrine was founded in the Wadō era (708-714). 
A Buddhist temple called "Miroku-ji" was built next to it in 779, making it what is believed to be the first shrine-temple ("jingū-ji") ever. The shrine-temple complex, called , lasted until 1868.
"Usa" first appears in the chronicles of Imperial history during the reign of Empress Shōtoku.
"Usa jingū" was designated as the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") for the old Buzen Province. It serves today as one of the "ichinomiya" of Oita and Fukuoka Prefectures.
From 1871 through 1946, Usa was officially listed among the first rank of government supported shrines.
"Usa" is today the center of over 40,000 branch Hachiman shrines. In Shinto belief, the many Hachiman shrines have extended the reach of the "kami" at Usa.

C. Lloyd Morgan

Conwy Lloyd Morgan, FRS, usually known as Lloyd Morgan, (6 February 1852 – 6 March 1936) was a British ethologist and psychologist. He is best remembered for the experimental approach to animal psychology now known as 'Morgan's canon', which is a specialised form of Occam's razor. His idea played a role in the later growth of behaviourism in psychology. 
Lloyd Morgan was born in London and studied at the Royal School of Mines and under T.H. Huxley. He taught in Cape Town, but in 1884 joined the staff of University College, Bristol as Professor of Geology and Zoology. He quickly became interested in the field he called 'mental evolution', the borderland between intelligence and instinct. In 1901 he became the college's first Professor of Psychology and Education.
In 1909 Lloyd Morgan became the first Vice-Chancellor of Bristol University. He held the office for a year, then was Professor of Psychology and Ethics until his retirement in 1919. 
Under Lloyd's canon, animal behaviour should be explained in the simplest possible way. For example, an animal should be considered conscious only if there is no other explanation for its behaviour. Where behaviour seems to imply higher mental processes, it might be explained by trial and error learning. An example is the skilful way in which his terrier Tony opened the garden gate, easily misunderstood as an insightful act by someone seeing the final behaviour. Lloyd Morgan, however, had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response, and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it.
W.H. Thorpe commented as follows:
This kind of study throws light not only on inherited behaviour but on the maturation of sense organs and the central nervous system. Behaviour changes in most animals during the first hours and days of life. The causes of those changes in behaviour may be developmental maturation, or learning, or some combination of the two. This is a primary area of research in ethology.

Dutch Empire

The Dutch Empire owned several territories that were in control by the Dutch Republic (also known as the United Provinces). The Dutch had created colonial empires. These were similar to Portugal and Spain. The Dutch Empire used their skills in shipping and trade with other empires. However, they were trying to be independent from Spain. With the British, the Dutch first built up colonies. The colonies were based on state capitalist corporate colonialism. This was done by the Dutch East and West India companies. The Dutch explored and went on voyages. Some of these were led by Willem Barents, Henry Hudson and Abel Tasman. These men found new places for Europeans.
The Dutch naval power were getting bigger. The Netherlands became the dominated global commerce during the second half of the 17th century. This was called the Dutch Golden Age. The Netherlands lost many colonials and its global power to the British. This happened when the metropole fell to French armies during the Revolutionary Wars. The rest of the Dutch Empire (such as the Dutch East Indies) were in control of the Dutch until the decline of European imperialism following World War II.
Today, the Netherlands are part of a federacy called the Kingdom of the Netherlands. These countries, the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten are part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Kaṉpi is part of the Murputja Homelands, which also includes the family outstations Angatja and Umpukulu. The residents are mostly Pitjantjatjara people with their traditional country nearby. The settlement started as an outstation for the Baker family, who moved here from other parts on the APY lands to be closer to the country of their ancestors.
Because both Kaṉpi and nearby Nyapaṟi are small communities, there are only basic services and most of them are shared between the two towns. In Kaṉpi there is a work shop, a garage, a day care centre and an art centre. It also has a community store, built in 1996, which has a pump for petrol. Food and supplies are delivered once every two weeks. The store services both Kaṉpi and Nyapaṟi, as well as nearby outstations. Local health services are based at the clinic in Nyapaṟi. Both Kaṉpi and Nyapaṟi had their own schools from 1987, but these joined together in 1993. The new school, Murputja Education Centre, was built between the two communities, east of Kaṉpi and 6 km west of Nyapaṟi.

"Dokkyo Saitama Junior & Senior High School" is a private co-ed school. It consists of junior and senior high school students. The high school is in Koshigaya City,Saitama, Japan. Dokkyo Saitama High School was founded in 1982. About half of the students enter at the beginning of junior high school and the other half enter at the beginning of senior high school. Their classes are separate at the freshmen and junior grades. Then, students study in the same class during their senior year. About 15% of students that graduate from Dokkyo Saitama High School enter Dokkyo University to complete their education. Dokkyo has been a popular top private school in Saitama due to their small class sizes, more individual teaching and their international exchange program with other schools around the world.
In 1881, the Doitsu Gaku Kyokai (German Education Association) was established for people to study German culture and sciences to help with Japan's modernization into a developed country. In association, the Doitsu Gaku Kyokai Gakko (German Education Association School) was founded in 1883. It was the first junior high school in Japan to teach German.
In 1947, after World War II, the Doitsu Gaku Kyokai was renamed Dokkyo Gakuen(Dokkyo Educational Institution) and both Dokkyo junior and senior high schools were established in Mejiro in Tokyo.
In 1980, Dokkyo Saitama High School was established in Koshigaya City inSaitama, and in 2000 Dokkyo Saitama Junior High School was also established at the same campus. At that time, more than 4,200 students took the entrance exam.
In 2005, Dokkyo Saitama High School celebrated their 25th anniversary.
Dokkyo Saitama High School mission statement is Reclamation, Creation, Love and Faith.
Dokkyo Saitama Junior & Senior High School has a long tradition of providing educating to students that helps develop character using physical, moral and intellectual training. The school’s curriculum is made up of three basic goals to teach and encourage students to:
Because of the popular curriculum, high expectations and teaching styles of Dokkyo Saitama Junior & High School, getting into the High School can be difficult for the average student. The negative side to this is that after graduating from Dokkyo Saitama Junior & Senior High School it is difficult to get accepted into the top Japan colleges. 
The traditional event that takes place every year is the Ameisai (school festival), the athletic meet, where the student of the executive committee plays a key role and administration is accomplished.

Byte order mark

Byte order mark is an abstract character used to declare and recognize Unicode encoding of a text file. It is encoded as Unicode character U+FEFF byte order mark (BOM).
BOM use is optional, and, if used, should appear at the start of the text stream. The BOM gives the producer of the text a way to describe the text stream's endianness, and so its encoding such as UTF-8, or UTF-16.
The need for a BOM arises in the context of text interchange, rather than in normal text processing within a closed environment.
A leading BOM can defeat some legacy software, including Unix shebang, PHP and Java.
A BOM is commonly inserted by many software tools including Notepad and Visual C++,or Google Docs.

WWE Hell in a Cell

WWE Hell in a Cell is a professional wrestling event produced every year by WWE, a Connecticut–based professional wrestling promotion, and broadcast live only on pay-per-view (PPV). The event began in 2009, replacing No Mercy in the early October slot of WWE's PPV calendar. In 2012, WWE announced that Hell in a Cell would move to late October, leaving only one pay-per-view in October.
The show's concept is based on WWE's well-known Hell in a Cell match, in which wrestlers fight inside a 20-foot (6-metre) high roofed cell structure surrounding the ring and ringside area. Each main event match of the card is contested as a Hell in a Cell match. "Hell in a Cell" was chosen over "No Escape", "Locked Up" and "Rage in a Cage".
Since it began, the event has been held only in indoor arenas in the United States. Championship bouts are scheduled on every card. Under the former Brand Extension, WWE assigned its performers to either Raw or SmackDown, which in the 2009 and 2010 events caused matches to be set up between wrestlers on the same show.
In this PPV, all main events are fought as Hell in a Cell matches, in which the ring and ringside area are surrounded by a 20-foot high roofed cell structure. This type of match has no disqualifications or countouts, and also no escape. The only way to win is by pinfall or submission inside the ring.

Impatiens

Impatiens is a genus of about 850–1,000 species of flowering plants, widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere and tropics. Together with "Hydrocera triflora", they make up the family Balsaminaceae. 
These plants derives their scientific name "Impatiens" (Latin for "impatient") and the common name "touch-me-not" in reference to their seed capsules. When the capsules mature, they 'explode' when touched, sending seeds several metres away. This mechanism is also known as "explosive dehiscence"; see also rapid plant movement.
Impatiens have become one of the most popular garden annuals. Hybrids, typically derived from "Busy Lizzie" (the well-known "I. walleriana") and the New Guinea Impatiens ("I. hawkeri"), have commercial importance as garden plants. "I. walleriana" is native to East Africa, and was bred through selection by Claude Hope. The original series of impatiens bred by Hope was the 'Elfin' series of cultivars, later improved as the 'Super Elfin' series. Double-flowered cultivars also exist. But in tropical islands, such as Hawaiʻi, Busy Lizzie can also become a noxious weed.

Child-headed family

A child-headed family or child-headed household is a family in which a minor (child or adolescent) has become the head of the household. They are most common in developing countries and areas of war, where the children's parents have been killed by conflict or disease. In some cases, relatives of the children adopt them after the parents die. Situations where a child, usually the eldest, has to provide for the family happen when there are no adult relatives to take the children or the relatives can not afford to support more children. Whether and how much the government helps the orphaned family depends on the country. Most help comes from charity and aid organisations like UNICEF.
Child-headed families are most common in Africa. The HIV/AIDS epidemic has led to many situations where both parents have died and left behind a family of orphans. The children may begin taking over their parent's responsibilities before the last surviving parent has died, when the parent is sick or too weak to work. The eldest children often have to stop going to school and get a job instead in order to gain income for the family. A study by Cornell University in 2005 showed that, in Namibia, the average age of the children acting as parents in their families was 17; some were as young as 9 years old. The number of children heading households in sub-Saharan Africa is reported to be growing. A survey in South Africa in 2006 showed that 122,000 (0.67%) of the country's children were living in child-headed households.
In Rwanda, it is estimated that the 1994 genocide left at least 60,000 households to be run by children. Many of the girls who were raped during the conflict are left to raise both their siblings and their own children.

Ali al-Hajvery

Hazrat Sheikh Abul Hassan Ali Ibn Usman al-Jullabi al-Hajvery al-Ghaznawi, or Abul Hassan Ali Hajvery (sometimes also spelt as Hujwiri, Hajweri, Hajveri), more popularly known as Hazrat Daata Ganj Bakhsh (Persian/Punjabi, lit. The master who bestows treasures) or even simply as Daata Sahib (Persian/Urdu), was a famous Afghan Sufi mystic, saint and scholar during the 11th century. He made a significant contribution both to the spreading of Islam in South Asia and to promoting a more liberal, tolerant society in the region.
He was born around 990 AD near Ghazni, Afghanistan during the era of the Ghaznavid Kingdom and moved to "Hindustan" (or India) to settle in Lahore (now in present-day Punjab (Pakistan)) in 1077 AD.
His most famous written work is the "Revelation of the Veiled" (Kashf Al Mahjub) (کشفُ المحجوب), written in the Persian language. This is one of the earliest and most respected treatises of Sufism in Persian, and it debates Sufi doctrines of the past.
Al-Hajvery was interred in a famous mausoleum in Lahore, which is surrounded by a large marble courtyard, a mosque and other buildings. It is the most frequented of all the shrines in that old city, and indeed one of the most famous in Pakistan and the entire region. He is venerated as the Patron Saint of Lahore, where his name is a household word, and his mausoleum the object of pilgrimage from distant places, by people of all religious beliefs. Along with Khwaja Moin-ud-din Chishti, Farid-ud-din Ganj Shakar, Lal Shahbaz Qalandar and Jalal-u-din Surkh Bukhari, he is deemed in popular Punjabi literature and culture, as one of the "Panj Peer" (Five Sages/Holy Ones) who exert mystic control and authority over all of the South Asia. These five saints or sages are thus invoked for help by many people, too.

Mount Conner

Mount Conner (also called Atila) is a mountain in central Australia. It is in the southwest corner of the Northern Territory, southeast of Lake Amadeus. It is above sea level and above the ground around it. The mountain was named by William Gosse in 1873 after South Australian politician Mountifort Longfield Conner. It can be seen from the road towards Uluṟu when coming from Alice Springs.
Mount Conner is a flat-topped inselberg, shaped like a horseshoe. The rock is sedimentary. Its layers were left behind when the area was an inland sea, during the Neoproterozoic era (1Ga to 542Ma). The rock of Mount Conner is 200 to 300 million years older than the rock of nearby Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa. The younger layers of sedimentary rock eroded over millions of years leaving the inselberg that is seen today.
The mountain is known as Atila (also sometimes spelled "Artila", "Atula", "Attila" or "Artilla") in the native Yankunytjatjara and Pitjantjatjara languages. The country around it is called Atilanya. It is associated with "Tjukurpa" (Dreaming) stories about the "" (means "ice people"; commonly spelled "ninya"). The "nyiṉya" are ancestral spirits who bring cold weather.
For the native Yankunytjatjara people, Mount Conner has long been associated with the Wanambi Dreaming. ' is a ancestral spirit who is said to live in the springs in and around the mountain. Legends relating to this Dreaming were recorded by Charles Mountford when he visited the area in 1940. He wrote that a very dangerous one was said to live in , a spring that used to exist halfway up the southern slopes. When the spring dried up, the men of Atilanya believed that the ' was stolen from them by the people to the south, who placed the spirit in a spring of their own country so that they would have more water.
About southwest of Mount Conner is another water source, a rock hole called (in English, "Aneri Well" or "Mount Conner Well"). Mountford camped there in 1940 on his way to Uluṟu, and recorded the name as "Anneri". He wrote that this was said to be the home of a harmless ' that had travelled north to Anari from the Musgrave Ranges. He also wrote about ceremonies relating to the ' being performed by the women here.
Mountford also recorded another legend associated with the mountain, of a fight between two boys who were hunting in the area. According to the legend, one of the boys discovered the spring at Anari by chance. He refused to tell the other boy where he had found water and, as a result, the second boy nearly died of thirst. They duelled together and slowly made their way to the top of the mountain, where they died. Their bodies are said to be preserved as boulders.
Anari was used as the site of the first homestead of Mount Conner Station. This is now abandoned, and the new homestead is located further north, on the Lasseter Highway. A track leads from here to the base of Mount Conner.
Mount Conner is made up of conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones and mudstones. The summit consists of coarse-grained sandstone with pebble layers and small beds of pebble conglomerate and siltstone. The rock that lies underneath this is composed of dark brown micaceous siltstone, mudstone, and fine-grained sandstone. The lower part of the mountain consists of medium to coarse-grained, grey-brown sandstones, dark-brown siltstones, and cherts. The sides of Mount Conner are also covered by scree (talus) and its top is covered with colluvium. The base of the mountain is surrounded by alluvium.
The summit of Mount Conner, along with the summits of Kata Tjuṯa and Uluṟu, is left over from the erosion of a layer of sediment from the Cretaceous period. It is considered to a classic example of an inselberg created by erosion of surrounding strata.

Crime in Afghanistan

Crime in Afghanistan happens in many ways. Some of the crimes are: corruption, contract killings or assassinations, kidnapping, drug trafficking, money laundering, black marketeering, and other ordinary crimes.
Growing Opium poppy and drug trafficking are important to the political and economic situation of Afghanistan. After the Soviet war in Afghanistan, growing opium poppy increased. Growing opium poppy was taxed. Some members of the military were directly involved in illegal drug trade. The Taliban did not want people to grow drugs. Because it made so much money they were tolerant and taxed the drug growing. 
In 1999, Afghanistan made over 4,581 metric tons of raw and refined opium. This led to more international pressure from places the drugs were sold to. In response, the Taliban said no one could grow opium poppy. The did allow the opium trade to continue. With the ban the opium was reduced to 185 metric tons. This little production of opium continued in areas under the control of the United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan.
Since the downfall of the Taliban in 2001, growing and trafficking of opium has increased significantly. Criminal organizations and corrupt government officials have used drug trafficking as a way to make money. Some anti-government groups make profit from the drug trafficking. 
Afghanistan is world's largest producer of opium. In 2001, Afghanistan was the source of 87% of the world's illegal opium. 80-90% of the heroin consumed in Europe comes from opium made in Afghanistan. According to Antonio Maria Costa "drugs are now a clear and present danger" in Afghanistan. In 2007 the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime said 93% of the opiates on the world market came from Afghanistan.
Unemployment among a large portion of the population is part of the reason for crime. Other forms of crime include robbery as well as kidnappings and assault. Many riots have occurred in the country in response to the political and other issues.
Since the downfall of the Taliban, crime rate has greatly increased in the capital city Kabul. Armed robberies are reported in the western districts of Kabul. Between March 2002 and January 2003, 48 cases of homicide, 80 cases of theft and 12 cases of kidnappings were reported in Kabul municipal boundaries.

Crime in Armenia

Crime in Armenia includes human trafficking, domestic violence, murder, political murder, contract killing, tax evasion, corruption, extortion, money laundering, police brutality, organized crime, and clan or gang violence.
The quick change from a Communism system to a free market capitalist system destroyed the socioeconomic structure of Armenia. 
During the first ten months of 2008, crime in Armenia's capital Yerevan rose nearly 14 percent from the same period in 2007.
Organized crime is a part of the Armenian economy. In Yerevan there are organized, criminal clans known as "akhperutyuns" (or "brotherhoods"). The different groups sometimes battle for rights over their territory. Members are guided by the underworld laws brought from Russian prisons.
Most of the smaller cities, towns, and villages of Armenia are also controlled by a clan or family.
A "well-paid job" is very often the bait used to persuade women in difficult social situations to travel abroad. 
In July 2004, Russia’s Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliev said that growing cooperation between Russian and Armenian law enforcement bodies has prevented more than one hundred Armenian women from being trafficked abroad for sexual exploitation. According to Nurgaliev, "criminal groups" which have been neutralized planned to transport the mostly young women to third countries, mainly the United Arab Emirates, via Russia. On June 24, 2004, members of a criminal group who were intent on forcing 6 Armenian women into prostitution were arrested.
On April 20, 2009, Anoush Martirosyan, the infamous "Madame Pimp" of Dubai, was sentenced to thirteen years in prison by a Yerevan judge. Martirosyan ran a prostitution ring in Dubai to which she lured girls from Armenia.
According to a 2008 study by Amnesty International, more than a quarter of women in Armenia "have faced physical violence at the hands of husbands or other family members." Reporting domestic violence is heavily stigmatized in Armenian society. Many of these women have no choice but to stay in abusive situations.

Crime in Bahrain

There is a low rate of crime in Bahrain. Some petty crime such as pickpocketing and bag snatching are reported especially in the old market areas (souks). Violent crime is uncommon, but increasing. Much of the crime in the nation is committed by the large South Asian population of guest workers. Though small in size, there is a growing underground drug market in the country. According to Emile Nakhleh, about 65% of violent crime and theft are done by foreign citizens living in Bahrain.
Charisse Tia Maria Coston and Freda Adler wrote a book about the reasons behind the low crime rate in Bahrain. The society of Bahrain follows the teachings of the Qur'an; the Qur'an influences political, economic and social environment. Islam, which is most important in the structure of Bahraini society, teaches wrongdoings will result in downfall of societies. 
Bahrain is a destination country for men and women trafficked for the purposes of involuntary servitude and commercial sexual exploitation. Men and women from Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia cine to Bahrain to work as laborers or domestic servants. Some are placed in involuntary servitude such as unlawful withholding of passports, restrictions on movements, non-payment of wages, threats and physical or sexual abuse. Women from Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Southeast Asian country like Thailand and North African nation like Morocco are trafficked to Bahrain for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation.
Threat of terrorist attack is a matter of concern. The Government of Australia advised travelers "to exercise a high degree of caution in Bahrain" due to high threat of terrorism. 
In the Corruption Perceptions Index 2007, Bahrain was ranked 46th out of 179 countries for corruption.

Crime in Bangladesh includes many different crimes. Some of these crimes are done by an individual and some crimes are organized by a group. Examples of crime are: drug trafficking, money laundering, extortion, murder for hire, fraud, human trafficking, robbery, corruption, black market, political violence, terrorism, abduction, etc.
Bangladesh is used to move narcotics made in neighboring countries. A 2007 report said that Bangladesh is now the main point for the movement and trafficking of heroin from Southeast Asia to the European market . 
A total of 10,331 homicides were reported from 2001 to 2003. This is a large increase.
For the Asia Pacific region, Bangladesh is ranked as one of the main countries for software piracy. It is believed that software vendors lose around 102 million US dollars every year to this black market trade. There is no strict law to stop this practice.
In 2011 Bangladesh was ranked 120th for corruption in a list of 182 countries. This means there appears to be a high amount of corruption in the country.

Belgium is considered a mostly safe country compared to its neighbouring countries. Brussels had the fourth highest number of recorded crimes of European capitals (behind Stockholm, Amsterdam, and Berlin). Brussels had a rate of 10 murders or violent deaths per 100,000 citizens. Belgium's second largest city, Antwerp, has crime rates about 20% below those of Brussels. Liège and Charleroi, industrial cities with high unemployment rates, saw higher crime rates than the less industrialized cities of Ghent and Bruges. The rural areas are generally very safe.
Marc Dutroux did many serious crimes and is likely Belgium's worst criminal. He is in prison. 
In November 2005, Brussels was very minorly affected by the spread of the French riots. There has been a steep increase in violent armed robberies carried out by minors. Cybercrime is also growing.
In 2011, a man killed six people, then himself, in Liege.
In the 1990s and early 2000s, attacks were made on vans used to move. They often killed the security agents in charge. The country had several large-scale crime scandals, such as those of the Brabant Wallon killers, the Scarface gang and the Belgian Mafia. More recently, some scandals have been about corruption and misuse of public resources. In addition, petty crimes such as street thefts, purse snatchings, and pickpocketing are in the main city centers. There are not very many of these crimes. Car theft used to happen often.

Crime in Benin is high and targets visitors. Petty crime is common all over the country. Street robbery is a large problem in Cotonou. Robbery and mugging happen near hotels used by international visitors. Many times a gun is used, but there is only minor injury to the victim. These crimes happen even in daylight hours.
Overland travel can be dangerous. Highway bandits block the road. They then steal the car. There is very little security on the roads. The borders between countries are not strong.
Drug trafficking in Benin is growing. The government does not stop drugs from going through the country. Drug use in Benin is low. Marijuana is the drug used most. Marijuana is grown in the central part of Benin. 
There is a high rate of credit card and automated teller machine (ATM) fraud.
In 2011, Transparency International ranked Benin as 100th of 182 countries on perceived corruption. Benin's score was 3, with 10 being the best possible score.

Crime in Bhutan

Bhutan has a low crime rate. Petty crime is sometimes reported in the country. Violent crime is very uncommon. Some cases of drug abuse are reported. alcohol abuse is a problem. In general, drug trafficking is low. The most serious threat to Bhutan's security is terrorism by different groups from India who are staying in the nation.
In June 1999, television was introduced in the country. Bhutan was the last nation in the world to have television. Some people think the introduction of television did not fit with Bhutanese culture. They say it is a reason crime increased.
Violent crime is very low in Bhutan. Levels of theft are low. Petty crime like pickpocketing are sometimes reported in the country. Juvenile crime has increased. The highest rate of juvenile crime was reported in 2003 when 63 youths were convicted across the nation. Rape is not a large problem. In 1999 only 10 rapes were reported in Bhutan. Homicide rate is low. In 1998, homicide rate per 100,000 citizens was 2.78. Bhutan is a source and transit country for human trafficking. Women are trafficked from Bhutan to other countries for commercial sexual exploitation. 
The first case of corruption in Bhutan was reported on April 5, 2002. A man was charged with embezzlement. Four cases of white-collar crime and violent crime were reported in April 2003.
In 2011, Bhutan was ranked 38th out of 182 countries for corruption (least corrupt countries are at the top of the list). Its score was 5.7 with 10 being the highest possible.
Slight drug abuse has appeared in the country. Free trade with neighboring India and the refugees make Bhutan vulnerable to drug trafficking. Bhutan is close to certain areas in Nepal and North-East India where intravenous drug use is high. Because of this, Bhutan has had an increase in intravenous drug use. Marijuana, which grows as a shrub in Bhutan, was only used to feed pigs before the introduction of television. Hundreds have now been arrested for using marijuana. Use of amphetamines and benzodiazepines smuggled from India is rising in Thimpu and in the Southern Bhutan. Drug trafficking and production of opium, cannabis and other drugs is not a large problem in the country.
Alcohol consumption is the most serious addiction related problem in the nation. Alcohol abuse is reported in nearly 80% of domestic violence crimes.
In 2004, selling of tobacco products to Bhutanese citizens was outlawed in the country. This made Bhutan the first nation in the world to ban tobacco sales. Severe punishment was added for selling of tobacco. Karma Tshering of the Bhutanese Customs said, "If any foreigner is caught selling tobacco products to Bhutanese nationals, he will be charged with smuggling. Tobacco will be treated as contraband." However a black market in tobacco has grown in the country.
Many groups from India have set up training camps in the southern part of the country. The United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) and the Bodo Liberation Tigers Force (BLTF) had bases in Bhutan in 2002. Terrorists were involved in murders, extortion and kidnappings. Bhutan told the terrorists they must leave the country by December 2001. In December 2003 there was a military campaign to remove these groups. Many terrorist camps were destroyed. It is thought that terrorists are trying to make retaliatory attacks against Bhutan. On September 5, 2004, a bomb exploded in Gelephu killing two people and injuring twenty seven. The NDFB was suspected behind the attack.

Crime in Brazil

Crime in Brazil has had an increase in violent and non-violent crimes. According to most sources, Brazil has high rates of violent crimes, such as murders and robberies. The homicide rate was getting smaller, but has started going back up from 2006 onwards. In 2010 it was above 25 homicides per 100,000 people. This makes is one of the 20 worst rates in the world.
Kidnappings do still happen. Increased police know-how has helped the problem. Prostitution "per se" is not a crime in Brazil, unlike procuring. The Government of Brazil has increased efforts to combat child prostitution and sex tourism. In 2010, there were 473,600 people in Brazilian prisons and jails. Drugs are responsible for 85,000 of the total.
It is believed that most life-threatening crime in Brazil is linked to drug trade and alcoholism. Brazil is a heavy importer of cocaine. It is part of the international drug route. Arms and marijuana used by criminals are mostly locally produced.
New laws have stricter punishment for domestic abuse and driving under the influence. Thousands of human trafficking and slavery cases are reported each year. These are usually connected to sugarcane plantations or, in the cities, illegal immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Crime rates change greatly across the country, with a higher amount in metropolitan suburbs and in border zones.
The crime of money laundering was introduced in 1998. The Internet is home to many Brazilian hackers. Online hate speech, heavily punished by Brazilian law, is difficult for officers to catch. Land crimes are a problem.
A continuing problem is the human rights violations during capture and custody of suspects. On the other hand, criminal charges have been described as very easy, allowing violent criminals an early return to society. The justice system is slow. This is largely because of loopholes that allow for numerous appeals. According to the U.S. Department of State, a majority of crimes are not solved.
Express kidnappings, where individuals are taken and forced to withdraw money from automated teller machines, are common in major cities including Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Brasília, Curitiba, Porto Alegre, Salvador and Recife. Petty crimes such as pickpocketing and bag snatching are common. Thieves work in outdoor markets, in hotels and on public transport.
Organized crime is a serious problem in Brazil. It is well established in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Organizations include: Comando Vermelho, Amigos dos Amigos, Terceiro Comando Puro, and Primeiro Comando da Capital. There are groups of Punks and Skinheads in São Paulo and Curitiba.
Police brutality and corruption are widespread.
In some areas, current and former members of the police have formed vigilante gangs. These gangs say they are protecting people but are widely thought to be dangerous criminal gangs. They chase out or kill local drug dealers. They then use protection rackets and tax local businesses of all kinds. Rio de Janeiro "militias" have been responsible for murders of journalists and a judge. Areas under "militia" control tend to see a drop in murder rates but a rise in other forms of violent crime.
The National Public Security Force (NPSF) was started in June 2004 by the Ministry of Justice. They are to act in emergency situations. It brings together the best police states and the Federal Police.
BOPE ("Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais", or "Special Police Operations Battalion"), is the elite group of the Military Police. Their missions are: Break barricades made by drug traffickers; get out police officers or civilians injured in fighting; serve high-risk arrest warrants; hostage rescues; stop prison rebellions; and conduct special missions in rough terrain such as swamps or mountainous areas.. They chase out or kill local drug dealers

Student's t-test

A t-test is a statistical hypothesis test. People use it when they want to compare a mean (average) of a measurement from one group A to some theoretical, expected value. People also use it when they want to compare the mean (average) of a measurement of two groups A and B. They want to decide if the mean in group A is different to the theoretical value or to the mean in group B.
For example, pretend there are two groups of people. One group exercises a lot and the other doesn't. Do the people who exercise tend to live longer than those who don't? Then the property of interest is the average life time. Is the average life time of people who exercise different to the average life time of people who don't? A t-test can help answer this question.
The t-test is used when the property's variance in the groups is unknown. When people want to do the t-test they have to calculate the variance from the sample (the collection of data). This calculated variance is almost always different to the true variance in the group. The t-test was created to care about this difference.

Talokar

Talokar is the name of a village in the Haripur District of Hazara, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly North-West Frontier Province) in Pakistan. It is situated at Latitude 33.9852778 degrees; and Longitude 72.9419444 degrees. It is quite closely situated to Haripur town (approx 2 km) the local area headquarters. 
It was originally founded during the 12th or 13th century AD by the Talokar Jatt tribe. They were later removed from the area along with other earlier settlers by a series of Afghan/Pashtun invasions circa the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Since then, it has remained the principal seat of a "Jagir" estate during the British Raj, of a famous aristocratic family which also produced Khan Sahib Abdul Majid Khan Tarin, OBE, Jemadar Abdul Latif Khan Tarin IDSM, and others.
The approximate population of the main Talokar village at the time of the last major national census was about 4800-5000. and it is primarily an agrarian area. It is well known for its fine vegetables, wheat and maize crops and orchards of loquats, oranges and other fruits. Although the majority of the residents are engaged in farming activities, a fairly large number are also in government and military service and some few working in local industries or working abroad as immigrant labour.
The main tribes and ethnic groups include Gurjars, Maliars, Pathans, Syeds, Awans and some others. The principal families and landowners are still mostly Tarin/Tareen Pathans (Pashtuns). In terms of religious practices, the population is overwhelmingly Muslim, mostly of the Sunni Islamic persuasion. The main language spoken here are Hindko, Northern Punjabi language (Chhachi dialect) and some Pashto.
The general level of literacy/education is quite high by Pakistani standards, with schooling for both boys and girls available until high school level and an average literacy rate of 74%. For further education, most students go to colleges in Haripur town or nearby Abbottabad and some even as far as Peshawar, Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
Among popular pastimes here are sports such as Cricket, Football (soccer), Field hockey and Volleyball. Many people also engage in hunting, horse riding and the traditional martial art of Gatka.

Dervish

A dervish or darvesh is a type of Sufi. 
It is someone living a Sufi Muslim ascetic way or "Tariqah". They are poor, and live simply. In this respect, dervishes are most similar to mendicant friars in Christianity, or Hindu/Buddhist/Jain sadhus.
The whirling dance that is associated with dervishes is best known in the West by the performances of the Mevlevi order in Turkey. It is part of a ceremony known as the Sema. It is also done by other orders. The Sema is only one of many Sufi ceremonies performed to try to reach religious ecstasy ("majdhb", "fana"). 
The name "Mevlevi" comes from the Persian poet Rumi, who was a dervish himself. This practice, though not intended as entertainment, has become a tourist attraction in Turkey.

Don Dunstan

Donald Allan "Don" Dunstan AC, QC (21 September 1926 – 6 February 1999) was a South Australian politician. He was the leader of the state's Labor Party from 1967, and was Premier of South Australia between June 1967 and April 1968, and again between June 1970 and February 1979.
Dunstan was born in Fiji to a rich Australian couple. He moved to Adelaide when he was a teenager, to go to school on a scholarship. He later studied law and arts at the University of Adelaide. He entered politics in 1953, getting a seat in the South Australian parliament at the age of 26. He became well known for his campaign against the death penalty during the 1950s, and his status in the Labor Party rose quickly. As a member of the opposition, he was able to get the parliament to pass changes to Aboriginal civil rights. He was also an important figure in his party's abandoning the White Australia Policy.
Dunstan was a socially progressive premier. His government recognised native title over Aboriginal lands, decriminalised (made legal) homosexuality, and abolished the death penalty. Appointed during his term were the first female judge, the first non-British governor, and later, the first indigenous governor. Dunstan also relaxed censorship and drinking laws in the state, created a ministry for the environment, and made laws against discrimination. His nine years in office during the 1970s are remembered as the "Dunstan Decade". However, there were also problems: the state's economic growth began to slow down, and led to major infrastructure plans being abandoned. Unemployment in South Australia began to rise, as well as rumours of corruption. Dunstan became strained after the death of his wife, and he suddenly resigned from the premiership in 1979 after collapsing from illness. He lived for another two decades, and remained very outspoken in public about social policies.

Kings Canyon is a canyon in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is part of Watarrka National Park, about southwest of Alice Springs. The walls of Kings Canyon are over 100 metres high, with Kings Creek at the bottom. The rock is sandstone. At the top of the gorge is a maze of weathered rock domes, a lot like those found in Purnululu.
Kings Canyon and the area around it is Aboriginal land. It is part of the Luritja people's traditional country, and title over the land was granted to them in July 2012. Before the arrival of Europeans in the region, the damp climate at the bottom of the gorge was an important refuge during droughts. Rock engravings at the base of the canyon date are many hundreds of years old. Many of them are sacred sites for Luritja and are closed to visitors. The name "Waṯarrka" refers to the area around the sacred Dreaming path that runs through the park; it comes from the Luritja name for the "Acacia ligulata" tree.

Metabolic rate

Metabolic rate is the amount of energy used by an animal per unit of time. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy used daily by animals at rest. 
About 70% of a human's total energy expenditure is due to the basal life processes within the organs of the body (see table). About 20% of one's energy expenditure comes from physical activity and another 10% from the digestion of food after eating. 
All of these processes require an intake of oxygen and coenzymes to provide energy for survival, usually from macronutrients like carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The Krebs cycle produces energy-rich ATP molecules, and gives off carbon dioxide.
Basal metabolism is usually by far the largest component of total energy used. The release, and using, of energy in this state is sufficient only for the functioning of the vital organs, the heart, lungs, nervous system, kidneys, liver, intestine, sex organs, muscles, and skin.
For the BMR, most of the energy is consumed in maintaining fluid levels in tissues through osmosis, and only about one-tenth is consumed for mechanical work, such as digestion, heartbeat, and breathing.
What enables the Krebs cycle to perform metabolic changes to fats, carbohydrates, and proteins is energy, which can be defined as the ability or capacity to do work. 
The breakdown of large molecules into smaller molecules – associated with release of energy – is catabolism. The breakdown of proteins into amino acids is an example of catabolism. Body heat in warm-blooded animals is produced by chemical reactions of the catabolic type.
The building up process is termed anabolism. The formation of proteins from amino acids is an anabolic process.
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the intermediate molecule that drives the transfer of energy used in muscle contraction. ATP is a high energy molecule because it stores large amounts of energy in the chemical bonds of the two terminal phosphate groups. The breaking of these chemical bonds in the Krebs cycle provides the energy needed for muscular contraction.
The metabolic rate varies between individuals. One study of 150 adults representative of the population in Scotland reported basal metabolic rates from as low as 1027 kcal per day (4301 kJ) to as high as 2499 kcal (10455 kJ). The average was 1500 kcal (6279 kJ) per day. 
The researchers calculated that 62.3% of this variation was explained by differences in the mass (weight) minus the fat reserves. Other factors were the amount of fat (6.7%), age (1.7%), and experimental error including within-subject difference (2%). The rest of the variation (26.7%) was unexplained.
So there are differences in BMR even when comparing two subjects with "the same" lean body mass. The top 5% of people are metabolizing energy 28-32% faster than individuals with the lowest 5% BMR. For instance, one study reported an extreme case where two individuals with the same lean body mass of 43 kg had BMRs of 1075 kcal/day (4.5 MJ) and 1790 kcal/day (7.5 MJ). This difference of 715 kcal (67%) is equivalent to one of the individuals completing a 10 kilometer run every day.
Metabolic rates vary according to animal size, and this has been discussed for over a century.

Kashgar

Kashgar or Kashi is an oasis county-level city with about 350,000 residents in the far west of the People's Republic of China, near the border with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Kashgar is the administrative centre of Kashgar Prefecture of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region which has a population of approximately 3.5 million. The city's urban area covers , though its administrative area extends for .
Kashgar was the meeting point for the southern and northern ancient Silk Routes for 2000 years because of its situation. The Taklamakan Desert is to the east of the city while westwards are the high mountains of Pamir so camels must be exchanged for yaks (or vice versa). Kashgar remains very much a predominantly Uighur city; its market called Sunday Bazaar is resorted to by merchants from nearby countries such as Kazakhstan, Tadjikistan, and Kirghizistan and is reputed the largest in Central Asia.

Programming paradigm

A programming paradigm is a way or style of how computer programs are written. There are four fundamentally different programming paradigms:
The Models of computation are different; Object-oriented and imperative paradigms use a Turing machine, functional programming is based on lambda calculus, and logic programming uses first order logic.
Today, many programming languages support more than one of the paradigms above. The choice of what paradigm to use to solve a problem is left to the software developer. Designers of Object-oriented system think of their program as a collection of interacting objects. People who use functional programming can think of it as a number of mathematical functions being applied. Different software engineers have different opinions on what paradigm is best to use. This is the same for programming languages. Very often, functional programming languages try to keep people from using assignments; in this view, it is better to use recursion to solve a problem. Another example is that of currying, used in functional programming. The idea there is to change a function taking many arguments into a number of functions, each one only taking one argument. These can then be called in turn,to get the same result.

Frank Yamma

Frank Yamma (born 1960s) is an indigenous Australian musician. He writes and sings songs in both English and Pitjantjatjara, and plays them in a mix of country and folk music. He plays guitar, usually an acoustic. He is often classified as a world musician, mixing styles from many different cultures, including traditional indigenous elements. Yamma's music is about the outback, the history of his homeland and the issues faced by his community.
Frank belongs to the Pitjantjatjara nation. He was born at a waterhole near Kaltukatjara, in the Northern Territory. He has seven older brothers. Frank's father was Isaac Yamma, a country singer who was one of the earliest musicians in Australia to become well known singing Western-style songs in a native language. Frank grew up in Alice Springs and played in a band with his brothers from an early age.
As a teenager, Frank would often play in his father's band, the Pitjantjatjara Country Band. In 1988, he played with them at the Festival of Aboriginal Rock in Darwin. He performed his own music for the first time at another festival in Darwin later that year, playing with an acoustic guitar. His biggest hit, though, was "Make More Spear", written by his father. He played it again at the Port Fairy Folk Festival in Victoria later in the year. In 1989, Yamma recorded an album with a project called "Ulpanyali", released through the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA). The song "History" was the biggest success and was later included in CAAMA's 25-year anniversary compilation album.
Frank's father died in 1990. In that year, he began playing in a band called the Secret Admirers, put together by Bill Davis. They travelled and played around the Northern Territory. They played at the Barunga Festival in Darwin in 1992. In 1995, he recorded songs with Bart Willoughby, Warren Williams and Tiddas. His solo song "Everybody's Talking" was recorded in Sydney for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In 1997, Yamma recorded an album with a project called "Terrasphere". He also released his first short solo album, "Solid Eagle". Both albums were released through CAAMA.
During the late 1990s, Frank began playing songs with David Bridie, and formed a new project called Digital Dreaming with Jim Lampi, Simon MacDonald and Zeus B. Held. The band produced the album "Inma Wiru" in January 1998. In 1999, Yamma formed the band Piranpa. The name means "white" in Pitjantjatjara, which is a reference to the fact that all the other band members are "whitefellas". They released the album "Playing with Fire" later in the same year. It included their version of Frank's song "Everybody's Talking". "Playing with Fire" won the "album of the year" award at the Indigenous Music Awards in 1999. It also won an award at that year's Deadlys. In the 2000 Summer Olympics, Yamma performed songs from the album as part of the torch events at Uluṟu. The song "Everybody's Talking" was included on the Games' official soundtrack.
Frank recorded a new version of his song "Coolibah" in 2001. It was produced by Bridie for the "Corroboration" compilation. It was a slowed-down version of Frank's original recording. The song is about the problems of alcoholism in Aboriginal communities, and is one of Yamma's most well-known songs. In the middle of 2001, Yamma went overseas to the United States and played solo in several major cities. He returned to Australia to play at the Yeperenye Festival in September 2001.
Yamma currently performs mainly solo or with Bridie. They won an AGSC Screen Music Award together in 2005 for the song "Pitjantjara", which was produced for a television mini-series, "The Alice". Yamma released his second solo album, "Countryman", in 2010.

The order was founded by Abu Ishaq Shami ("the Syrian") who taught Sufism in the town of Chisht, some 95 miles east of Herat in present-day western Afghanistan.
The Chishti Order is mostly followed in Afghanistan and South Asia. It was the first of the four main Sufi orders (Chishti, Qadiriyya, Suhrawardiyya and Naqshbandi) to be established in this region. Moin-ud-din Chishti was a medieval saint who first introduced the Chishti Order in Lahore (Punjab) and Ajmer (Rajasthan), in the early or middle of the 12th century AD. From these places it spread out throughout medieval India. There are now several branches of the order, which has been the most prominent South Asian Sufi brotherhood since that time. Chapters and branches are also found as far as Europe, North America and Australia, introduced there by immigrants from present India and Pakistan.

Elasticity of substitution

Elasticity of substitution is a measure of how easily something is able to be substituted with something else. It is often used in marketing and economics. A product has a low elasticity if it is unable to raise its price because similar products (substitutes) are available. A product that is unique is able to charge higher prices because there are not as many choices. For example, in a fish market, there are many fishermen selling many fish. The price is not elastic because there is competition between many suppliers of fish.

Tjunkaya Tapaya

Tjunkaya Tapaya (born 1947) is an Aboriginal Australian artist. She is most recognised for her batik work, and is one of the most well-known batik artists in Australia. Her works also include acrylic paintings, weaving, ceramics, wood carving and printmaking. Most of Tapaya's paintings depict places and events from her family's dreaming stories. Her batik work is of the classic Ernabella style, which eschews the Indonesian use of repeated block printed designs in favour of hand-drawn freehand designs or "walka". These "walka" are pure design and do not refer to, or contain reference to, dreamings or "tjukurpa".
Tjunkaya is a member of the Pitjantjatjara people. She was born in the desert in the far northwest of South Australia. Her mother had walked from Walytjitjata, in the Northern Territory, and arrived at Ernabella Mission at Pukatja or Ernabella shortly after Tjunkaya's birth. Ernabella was run by missionaries at the time, and Tjunkaya grew up there. The craft room at Ernabella Mission was established in 1948 and nurtured the artistic talents of Tjunkaya and other children and adults living on the Mission. The craft room taught spinning and weaving originally but later added batik and painting to its activities, and later still became a professionally run Aboriginal-owned incorporated arts enterprise known as Ernabella Arts after the Mission was closed and the land returned to its traditional Pitjantjatjara owners. 
Like most early artists in her community, Tjunkaya's original style came from "milpatjunanyi" – an ancient Western Desert practice of drawing in the sand to tell stories to children. This is the basis of the classic Ernabella "walka".
Ernabella women began to be taught batik making in 1971. In 1974, Ernabella Arts sent Tjunkaya to Yogyakarta with several other Pitjantjatjara women to learn more about making batik from Indonesian artists.
Tjunkaya's work has been shown in several exhibitions in Australia, Europe, North America and Southeast Asia. Tapaya has work in the National Gallery of Victoria, the State Library of South Australia, the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Museum of Australia, and the British Museum.

1968 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1968 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1968, and lasted until November 30, 1968. These dates are conventionally the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin.
Three storms formed in June, making it one of the most active Junes on record. The early part of the season had the most activity, and the season ended quietly compared to the beginning. There were eight named storms, and no major hurricanes. This shows that early season activity has no indication on the entire season. Hurricane Gladys was the costliest storm of the season, causing more than $6 million (1968 USD) in damage as it moved northward through Florida, Cuba, and North Carolina.
The following names were used for named storms (tropical storms and hurricanes) that formed in the North Atlantic in 1968.
The list is mostly the same as the 1964 season, save for Candy, Dolly, Edna, Frances, Hannah, and Ingrid, which replaced Cleo, Dora, Ethel, Florence, Hilda, and Isbell (although Ethel, Florence, and Isbell were not retired). A storm was named Candy for the first time in 1968. Names that were not assigned are marked in .
No names were retired this season. However, the name Edna was later retroactively retired because of the Hurricane Edna of the 1954 season, and has not been used since.

Gurdjieff

George Ivanovich Gurdjieff (13 January 1866 – 29 October 1949), usually known as Gurdjieff, was an Armenian guru and writer. He was an influential spiritual teacher of the first half of the 20th century. He himself was influenced by Sufi, Zen and Yoga mystics he met on his early travels.
Gurdjieff taught that most people live their entire lives in a state of hypnotic "waking sleep":
Gurdjieff developed a method for working towards a higher state of consciousness and achieving full human potential. He called this 
"The Work" or "The Method". 
Gurdjieff's method for awakening one's consciousness is different from that of the fakir, monk or yogi, so his discipline was called originally the "Fourth Way". 
At different times in his life, Gurdjieff formed and closed various schools around the world to teach the work. He claimed that the teachings he brought to the West came from his own experiences and early travels. The teachings expressed the truth found in ancient religions. They were wisdom teachings relating to self-awareness in people's daily lives, and humanity's place in the universe.
There is a 1979 British film, "Meetings with Remarkable Men", directed by Peter Brook. It is based on the book of the same name by Gurdjieff. It was shot on location in Afghanistan (except for dance sequences, which were filmed in England). It starred Terence Stamp as Prince Lubovedsky, and Dragan Maksimovic as the adult Gurdjieff. The film was entered into the 29th Berlin International Film Festival and nominated for the Golden Bear prize.

The first is the census of the population, taken from 1790 to the present. The second is the census of housing, which counts the number of residential housing units, and was taken from 1940 to the present. Among other uses, the count is used to determine how many places in the House of Representatives each state has. It also determines how much government money is spent in different locations. 
The United States Census Bureau is responsible for the United States Census. The first census after the American Revolution was in 1790. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson was responsible for this first census.

South Hampton Roads

South Hampton Roads is a region of the U.S. state of Virginia. It in the most southeastern part of the state. The area is part of the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Area). About 1.7 million people live there. 
Hampton Roads is the common name for the metropolitan area around the body of water of the same name. The land area of Hampton Roads is divided into two regions. These are South Hampton Roads on the south side and the Virginia Peninsula on the north side. People who live there commonly call South Hampton Roads "the Southside". 
As of the 2010 Census, the Hampton Roads MSA is the fifth largest metropolitan area by size in the southeastern United States. It is the second-largest between Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, Georgia.
The decision to call the region "Hampton Roads" was a political one. The area was called "Tidewater" for many years by the people who lived there. The local baseball team was called the Tidewater Tides for years. It is now called the Norfolk Tides. When they first came to Tidewater, they used the popular name to draw more fans.
South Hampton Roads is home to many United States military bases.
Norfolk Naval Shipyard and Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth are in Portsmouth. They are two very important and historic bases. The shipyard was created as the Gosport Shipyard on November 1, 1767. It had the county's first dry dock. The name was changed after the American Civil War. Although it is in Portsmouth, the name Norfolk was chosen because there was another U.S. Navy shipyard at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. There are also many smaller bases in Portsmouth.
Norfolk is the home of Naval Station Norfolk. It is the main base for United States Navy's Atlantic Fleet. The base was created in 1917. It is the largest naval facility in the world.
Virginia Beach is home to the Navy's Naval Air Station Oceana (NAS Oceana) and Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek (NAB Little Creek). NAS Oceana is the largest employer in Virginia Beach. Both bases there, like the Norfolk Navy Base, are said to be the largest of their kinds in the world. Also in Virginia Beach is NAVSEA Dam Neck and the home of Joint Expeditionary Base East
St. Julien's Creek Annex is a U.S. Navy base in Chesapeake. It is on the Elizabeth River. It began in 1849. It is currently part of the Norfolk Navy Base. Chesapeake is also home to U.S. Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Fentress. It is used to help support training for NAS Oceana.
From Colonial times through the first 150 years of the United States, South Hampton Roads was almost always changing. Local governments changed mainly because of growth in population. Counties were divided and towns were created as the population grew. Some towns grew to become cities. in 1871, changes were made to the state constitution. One of these changes made all cities in Virginia independent cities of the counties they had been a part of. 
In the second half of the 20th century, many city-county-town local government joined together in South Hampton Roads and on the Virginia Peninsula. Many small towns and cities joined together to create a small number of larger cities. Nowhere else in Virginia have rural areas and more dense cities been combined in this way. The changes caused the area to have Virginia's cities with the largest land areas and the most farming.
The South Hampton Roads region has five independent cities, two counties, and five incorporated towns.
Other settlements in South Hampton Roads no longer exist. No less than 2 shires, 6 counties, 1 town, and 2 entire cities no longer exist in the South Hampton Roads area. 
The following is a listing of these 11 extinct shire, counties, towns, and cities, with the approximate dates they existed:

<doc id="369039" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=369039" title="Gene therapy">
Gene therapy

Gene therapy means putting in a working gene to a person who has a damaged gene. The European Commission has approved this method for one particular treatment. The treatment by the product "Glybera" uses a virus to infect muscle cells with a working copy of the gene. The European Commission has given "Glybera" marketing authorisation, which means it can be sold throughout the EU.
One in a million people have damaged copies of the lipase gene needed to break down fats. Fat builds up in their blood; this leads to pain and inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). It is life-threatening. Up to now, the only way to manage the condition is to have a very low-fat diet.
When used in this way, a virus is a vector. That means it is a carrier; the gene has been inserted into the viral genome, and the virus sticks it into the human cells. The technique is called transfection. This technique is different from the gene knockout technique, which does not use a viral vector.
China was the first country to approve the commercial production of a gene therapy, in 2003. That gene therapy is for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)—a cancer that occurs in 10% of new cancers in China. There are 2.5 million new cancer patients every year in China.
Sold under the brand name "Gendicine", the world's first commercial gene therapy also uses a virus to insert the gene into the human genome.
The possibility of gene therapy was talked about as soon as the roles of DNA and RNA were known about. The first specific publication was in 1972. 
Many more types of gene therapy are in the trial stage. It is clear that a cycle of events will be part of future clinical medicine: DNA sequence analysis > identify defective genes > fix genes with gene therapy or gene knockout. There are sometimes problems of side-effects; these may be discovered at the trial stage. There is now a database which lists all known clinical trials.

Ruby is a member of the Pitjantjatjara nation. She was born about 1940, at a sacred site near Kata Ala, Western Australia. She grew up with her family in the bushland along the western side of the border with South Australia. Her family spent most of their time travelling between her father's homeland near Pukara and her mother's around Mantamaru. When Ruby was a teenager, they followed other Pitjantjatjara families to settle at Ernabella, far to the east. Ruby grew up and went to school at the mission there until she got married.
Ruby's husband was a stockman whose family came from what is now Amaṯa, west of Ernabella. After they got married, they moved north to Areyonga, where he worked on the cattle station. They later moved back to his homeland, where he got a job on the Musgrave Park station. They had five children together, before her husband died in his early 40s.
In 1999, the senior women of Amaṯa, including Ruby, founded Minymaku Arts (it is now called Tjala Arts). Ruby began working there herself in 2000. Her first solo exhibitions were in Hobart in 2003 and 2005, and then in Melbourne in 2008. Her artwork has been shown alongside works by other Tjala artists in every major city in Australia. She has also had her work shown in group exhibitions in Singapore and the United States. Her work is held in the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Queensland Art Gallery, the National Gallery of Australia, and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory.

Military science

Military science (also military studies) is the science on war, army and military operations.
The general purpose of the military science is to make clear how to win war. The historical root of the military science is the book that was written by Carl von Clausewitz who was a soldier in the Prussian army in the 19th century. In this book, Clausewitz made a discovery that war is an instrument for political act not only a violent action. Clausewitz suggested the relation between policy and war, and made it easy to define the being of the war as the means to enforce our will to the others with physical forces. This realistic view of the war that the political power controls military operations is meeting to the military science. The problem for military scientists is to study how to operate military actions.
Military science has some branches below.
In military science today, there are branches of each kind of military force; the army fights on land, the navy fights in the sea, and the air force fights in the air.
The most basic ideas in military science can be cut down five words; defense, attack, military mean, military aim and political end. In military science, the all form of the battles can be identified with defense and attack. The defense is to destroy enemy attack waiting on own positions, the attack is to destroy enemy going ahead. The result of the battle depends on the amount military means and military aim. Military mean can be called combat power can be followed from the number and quality of military force. Military aim is the specific target to decide how to use military mean with attack or defense. In military science, political end has the idea of the most reason to fight war against enemy. In short, military science generally researches the cause and effects of military operations between attacker and defender in terms of military means and aim, starting from the political end.
In the ancient era, military science started from records on the art of war rather than the science of war. Herodotus and Thucydides wrote the history of the Persian war and Peloponnesian wars. About the same time, Sun Tzu, a strategist in ancient China, wrote "The Art of War". This book showed that war is a serious way for the life and death of nations and surprise is important in the art of war. After the age of the Roman empire, Flavius Vegetius Renatus wrote Roman military theory in his book called "On Military Affairs". Vegetius noted Roman military power was based on discipline, which makes military organizations organized. The Roman way of war that Vegetius recorded had historical influences on military minds of people on Europe for a long time.
However, development of guns and artillery made military revolution that changed the art of war by the beginning of the modern age. Political modernization after religious reform also made important influences to the way of war because states got larger political power to establish modern military forces. The Napoleonic wars was caused by the changes in the way of war. Napoleon Bonaparte, who was one of the most experienced and known generals in military history, made a new idea on how to win wars in the Napoleonic wars. Considering the relations between force, space and time, Napoleon tried to attack the side and back of the enemy forces in battle through strategic movement and tactical surprise. The Napoleonic way of war was to spread out forces by the coming chance of fight, and concentrate forces at the most important time. This made it possible to win wars against the enemy even if his military force was weaker than the enemy force.
In this period, military theory made great progress. Antoine Henri Jomini, who served under Napoleon, wrote Napoleonic art of war as military theory in his "Summary of the Art of War". Jomini said there are few rules in the science of war. Jomini's theory gave reasons on how Napoleon won his wars by keeping the universal rule of war. Clausewitz, who served under Prussia fighting against Napoleon in war, also explained the nature of war through scientific studies on the Napoleonic wars. In his book "On War", Clausewtiz said the nature of war has laws that policy controls military operations in war. He also wrote that the mathematical model called law of number can be used to understand and how many results happen in a fight. In the debate of whether attack or defense was the stronger military action, Clausewitz supported defense because defending forces are able to use positions in a battle.
Napoleonic military theory changed military minds in the Western world in the late 19th century. Dennis Hart Mahan, who was in the United States army, was developed Napoleonic military art in his "Elementary Treatise on Advanced Guard, Outposts, and Detachment Service of Troops" and taught it in military school. Alfred Thayer Mahan, his son, wrote "The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660–1783" and became a naval strategist based on the military theory of Jomini and Clausewitz. In the Prussian army, Helmunth von Moltke lead studies of military theory, and made ideas of "Auftragstaktik" (mission tactics). By Moltke's study, Prussia got theories on how to move forces faster in the field and showed evidence of this theory through victory in the Franco-Prussian War. Alfred von Schlieffen, Prussian general and military theorist, made the plan of a two-front war against France and Russia, using fast strategic movement. In France, Charles J. J. J. Ardant du Picq developed military theory in his "Battle Studies" from the point of mental part of war. Ardnt du Picq thought military action is related to mental situations of military force.
During World War I and World War II, military scientists thought on the nature of total war. In World War I, Germany's general Hindenburg Ludendorff supported the idea of total war, appealing total effort by all nations for war. France's general Ferdinand Foch also said the victory depends on the will of the nation to fight the war. In this war, John Frederick Charles Fuller, who served in British army, found armored warfare important in land operations, because old land tactics could not work under modern firepower. In World War II, the air force started to develop as a military branch like the army and navy. Its military meaning was founded by an Italian soldier Giulio Douhet suggesting the use of strategic bombing to destroy the capital cities and industrial areas, not only the front. From the point of the naval view, aircraft can be used in sea battle with aircraft carriers. Ozawa Jisaburo, who served in Japanese navy, made an idea to put aircraft carriers on the center of naval power.
The end of the World War II in 1945 was the beginning of the Cold War between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It was necessary for military scientists to consider how to control nuclear weapons that superpowers developed in World War II. The nuclear weapons changed the strategic condition of the possible war. Military theorists had to consider how to avoid nuclear war and how to deal with nuclear strategy. Bernard Brodie, a military scientist in the United States, suggested to change the purpose of the military forces to deterrence from victory in his book "The Absolute Weapons". The idea of deterrence is to control enemy nuclear attack by letting the enemy know his risk of nuclear counterattack. Military science is no longer for military operations, but for the whole of the national security policy. Basil Henry Liddell-Hart, British military strategist, also said the old idea of strategy is narrow to use in nuclear age. His discovery was the idea of strategy can be used in matters of national security. This kind of strategy called grand strategy, or national security strategy spread for military theorists today.

Pituitary adenoma

Pituitary adenomas are tumors that occur in the pituitary gland. Pituitary tumors are generally divided into three kinds dependant upon their biological functioning: benign adenoma, invasive adenoma or carcinomas, with carcinomas accounting for 0.1% to 0.2%, appoximately 35% being invasive adenomas and most being benign adenomas. Pituitary adenomas represent from 10% to 25% of all brain tumors and is thought to happen in about 17% to 25% of most people.
Non-invasive and non-secreting pituitary adenomas are considered to be benign [harmless]; but a recent large study (Fernández-Balsells, "et al." 2011) has shown there are few studies to prove if this is true or not.
Adenomas that are bigger than are called "macroadenomas", and those smaller than 10 mm are called "microadenomas". Most pituitary adenomas are microadenomas. Most pituitary microadenomas often remain undiagnosed and those that are diagnosed are often found as an "incidental finding" [which means found by chance], and are called "incidentalomas".
Invasive adenomas may invade the dura mater, cranial bone, or sphenoid bone. It used to be thought that clinically active pituitary adenomas were rare but recent studies have suggested that they may affect about one in 1000 of the general population.

Skull bossing

Skull bossing is when the bones of the skull become bigger than normal which most often occurs in the frontal bones beneath the forehead. Skull bossing may happen from different medical conditions. 
Frontal bossing is when the forehead becomes bigger than normal which may also make the brow ridge stick out more. It happens when the frontal bone becomes bigger because of a medical condition. This often happens when other facial bones of the skull become bigger too, as well as the jaw bone and the bones in the hands and feet. Frontal bossing is usually seen in a few rare medical syndromes such as acromegaly - a chronic medical disorder in which the anterior pituitary gland makes to much growth hormone (GH).
Turricephaly often called "tower skull", may be caused by different medical conditions. In some cases such as Apert and Pfeiffer syndromes, it is caused when sutures in the skull close before they are supposed to.
Turricephaly is also one of the most common problems which affect the bones of the face and skull in those with Sickle-cell disease.

Acromegaly is a medical condition that happens when the anterior (rear) pituitary gland makes too much growth hormone (GH), after a person has passed puberty. If this happens before puberty it causes a condition known as gigantism. A number of medical conditions may cause the pituitary gland to make too much growth hormone, but the most common cause is a tumor on the pituitary gland called a pituitary adenoma'
Acromegaly is most commonly diagnosed in middle aged adults, and can result in severe disfigurement, serious complicating conditions, and early death if not treated. Acromegaly is hard to diagnose when it is just beginning. It is usually not found until 10–12 years after it starts. This is when it causes changes in the way a person looks, especially their face.

Silent stroke

A silent stroke is a kind of stroke that does not cause symptoms that can be seen in a major stroke such as slurred speech. A person who has had a silent stroke usually does not know it. A silent stroke still causes damage to the brain, and places the person at increased risk for both transient ischemic attack and major stroke in the future. 
These strokes are called "silent" because they typically happen in parts of the brain that do not cause problems that can be seen like those in a major stroke. A silent stroke usually happens in parts of the brain that control different thought processes, mood regulation and cognitive functions and is a leading cause of vascular cognitive impairment and may also lead to a loss of urinary bladder control.
In a big study in 1998, more than 11 million people were thought to have had a stroke in the United States. About 770,000 of these strokes had symptoms which could be seen and 11 million were first-ever silent strokes. Silent strokes usually cause lesions which are found by the use of neuroimaging such as MRI. 
There is more of chance of older people having a silent stroke but it may also happen to younger adults. Women appear to be at higher risk for silent stroke, with hypertension and current cigarette smoking being some of the reasons.
These types of strokes include lacunar and other ischemic strokes and minor hemorrhages. They may also include leukoaraiosis (changes in the white matter of the brain): the white matter is more susceptible to vascular blockage because it has less blood vessels than the cerebral cortex. 
In the Cardiovascular Health Study, a study used 3,660 adults over the age of 65, 31% showed evidence of silent stroke in neuroimaging studies using MRI. These people did not know they had a stroke. It is thought that silent strokes are five times more common than strokes that have symptoms.
A silent stroke is different than a transient ischemic attack (TIA). In TIA the symptoms can be seen and may last from a few minutes to 24 hours before getting better. If a person has a TIA there is a bigger chance they may have a major stroke and silent strokes in the future.

Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood

Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPVC for short) is a medical problem that happens in children. "Benign" means "harmless;" "paroxysmal" means something comes and goes suddenly; and "vertigo" means "dizziness." So BPVC is harmless dizziness in children that comes and goes suddenly.
The dizziness usually makes children feel like they are moving or spinning, or that the inside of their head is moving or spinning.
Usually, BPVC starts in children between two and five years old. It often goes away by the age of eight. But in some children, BPVC may start when they are much younger (as young as a few months old) or older (as old as 12 years old). 
BPVC is the most common cause of dizziness in children who do not have hearing loss or a diagnosed ear disease. It is a common problem that happens to about 2.6% of children (26 out of 1,000 children).
Doctors don't know for sure what causes BPVC. Some doctors think it is related to problems of the inner ear that affect balance. For example, some doctors think BPVC is similar to a different disorder which often happens in adults over 50. This disorder is called "benign paroxysmal positional vertigo" (BPPV). BPPV is a "vestibular disorder" - a disorder in the inner ear which affects balance. 
Other doctors believe BPVC is related to migraine headaches, but most children with BPVC do not get headaches.
For a doctor to diagnose Benign Paroxysmal Vertigo of Childhood, all of these things must be true:
"Differential diagnoses" are different medical disorders which may cause the same symptoms. When a doctor asks what the differential diagnoses for BPVC are, she is asking "what other disease could cause these symptoms? What else could this be?" Before a doctor makes a final diagnosis, they must think of what other medical conditions have the same or similar symptoms, and make sure one of them is not the problem.
Some of the differential diagnoses for BPVC are:

However, there are some artists that just start in manga. One way to do this is by applying to contests that magazines run.

<doc id="369102" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=369102" title="Menstrual migraine">
Menstrual migraine

Menstrual migraine (also called "catamenial migraine") is term used to describe both "true menstrual migraines" and "menstrually related migraines". About 7%-14% of women have migraines only at the time of menstruation, these are called "true menstrual migraines". Most female migraneurs experience migraine attacks throughout the menstruation cycle with an increased number perimenstrually, these are referred to as "menstrually related" or "menstrually triggered migraine".
It used to believed that treatments for migraine would work in menstrual migraine but that has not proven to be the case because menstrual migraines are harder to treat. Because of this, menstrual migraines are now considered a separate medical disorder from migraine. In 2008, menstrual migraines were given ICD-9 codes (346.4-346.43) of their own which separate menstrual migraine from other types of migraine.
About 40% of women and 20% of men will get a migraine at sometime in their life; most of them will get their first migraine before they are 35-years-old. Menstrual-related migraines happen in more than 50 percent of women who have migraine headaches.
Menstrual migraine attacks usually last longer than other migraine attacks, [Pinkerman and Holroyd, 2010] and short-term treatments do not work as well with menstrual migraine as they do in other kinds of migraine. They are usually migraines without aura, but in 2012 a case of menstrual migraine with aura was reported, so it is possible. Auras are a kind of condition which affect certain parts of the brain, usually the parts that control vision but they can also affect the parts of the brain which control the other senses like touch, motor control (moving parts of the body) and the parts of the brain that control speech.
Warning symptoms also called "prodrome symptoms" often happen before a migraine attack.
A pounding throbbing headache with the pain being on one side of the head (unilateral). The side of the head that has the pain changes from one headache to the next.
The diagnosis of a menstrual migraine is made by keeping track of when the migraines occur for a period of at least three months. Menstrually related migraine attacks occur usually between 2 days before and 3 days after the start of menstruation in at least 2 out of 3 menstrual cycles (periods) in a row. Pure menstrual migraine and menstrually related migraine are both migraines without auras with one exceptionnally rare case with aura reported in 2012.
The "Menstrual Migraine Assesment Tool" (MMAT) is a simple questionaire with three questions, that has shown to be fairly accurate in diagnosing menstrual migraine (Tepper SJ, 2008). The three questions are:
The answer to the first question has to be yes and there has to be at least one yes answer to either question 2 or question 3.
In order to keep track of what time of the month the migraines happen it is helpful to use a "headache diary". A person uses the headache diary to write down information about their headaches, like when they started, what kind of symptoms they had and how bad the pain was etc.
Often, having one medical condition makes it more likely a person will also have one or more other medical or psychiatric disorders. These other disorders are the "comorbid disorders" or "comorbidities". There are various comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions associated with migraines. The treatment and "prognosis" (if a disease gets better, worse or stays the same over time) of migraine is affected by the comorbid disorders which may be present and/or the chance of getting comorbid disorders.<br>
Comorbid psychiatric conditions
There are treatments which are used for menstrual migraines which may in some cases reduce how many times a woman gets them and how bad they are. This kind of treatment is called "prophylactic therapy" and it is used in the perimenstrual period which is the time between periods.
Prophylactic therapy for menstrual migraine should be tried for at least 3 menstruation cycles to see if that kind of treatment works before it is stopped. Medications used may include:
1. Napraxen sodium such as Aleve
"Acute treatments" (short-term treatment) include drugs called Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) (drugs that help stop "inflammation" which is redness, swelling, pain, tenderness, heat in parts of the body), triptans such as "Frovatriptan", ergotomines which are a kind of drug made from a fungus called ergot, and estrogen transdermal patches, which are patches worn on the skin that have estrogen in them which enters the body through the skin and then into the bloodstream.
The exact causes of menstrual migraine are not known for sure but there is a link between falling levels of the female hormone "estrogen" and the onset of a migraine attack. The estrogen level may fall after bleeding occurs during the menstrual cycle or when external sources of estrogen are no longer taken, like when a woman stops taking birth control pills or hormone pills in hormone replacement therapy.

Army Burn Hall College

Army Burn Hall College (ABHC) formerly Burn Hall School is a school and college in Abbottabad, Pakistan. In 1948, a year after Pakistan gained independence from the British Empire, a few missionary fathers moved to Abbottabad with a handful of students, from Srinagar, Kashmir, where the original school was, and founded a branch here. Between 1948 and 1977, the school was run by these missionary fathers and supervised by the Board of Education of the Rawalpindi Diocese of the Church of Pakistan. However, in 1977 the fathers were forcibly evicted by the Pakistan Army which took over the institution. They made several changes to the school and its spirit and mode of education, gradually bringing it into line with their own goals and objectives. Since 1990-1991, it is no longer a proper public school along the English model but a military-style graduate college, with separate branches for boys and girls.

Rabia Basri

Rābia al-Adawiyya al-Qaysiyya (; 717 – 801 AD) was a female Muslim saint and Sufi mystic. She was born in Basra, and is therefore also called Rābia al-Basrī ().
She was the fourth daughter of her family and therefore named Rābi’a, meaning "fourth". Her family was very poor. She was very devoted to God. When Rābia's father died, she became an orphan. She was captured by thieves and sold into slavery. During the day, she worked for her master. During the night, she prayed to God. Once her master learned about her passionate faith, he immediately released her. He decided to serve her instead.
Rābia became an ascetic. Over time, many came to follow her. Even though Rābia did many favors for them and lived in poverty and hardship, she never asked for anything, even from God.
The name Rābia is used to describe women of the highest type of spirituality. She is considered one of the most devoted Sufi saints. She is highly revered.

Qateel Shifai

Qateel Shifai (real name Aurangzeb) (24 December 1919 - 11 July 2001) () was a Pakistani Urdu poet of controversial reputation and work.
Qateel Shifai was born in Haripur, Hazara Division, British India (now Pakistan). He adopted 'Qateel Shifai' as his pen name in 1938. Due to his father's early death, Qateel was forced to quit his education. Being unsuccessful in his business he decided to move to Rawalpindi, where he started working for a transport company. In 1946, he was called to Lahore to work as the assistant editor of the monthly 'Adab-e-Latif', a literary magazine.
In January 1947, Qateel was asked to help write the songs of a film by a Lahore-based film producer. The first film he helped penned the lyrics for was "Teri Yaad". After that there was no looking back and initially, after working for some time as assistant lyricist to some of the famous poets/lyricists of the time (c.1947-48 to 1956-57), he eventually became a regular full-time film lyricist. Shifai wrote several collections of his poetry but is best known for being a film lyricist. During the 1970s and 1980s, quite some controversy developed regarding his 'misappropriation' of a couple of old poems, which had been adapted as film lyrics/songs in the movie "Gumnaam" (1954). It was later proved that this song, ' Tu lakh chale ri gori thum thum ke', was not Shifai's work and he had to retract his earlier claim and also remove it from a proposed collection of poems and songs he had planned to publish.
Later on after the late 1980s, Shifai settled down to a full-time career in the film industry and also produced new volumes of poems and songs, which were considered good. A few of these were also awarded literary prizes. However, even then, the rumors and criticism of his work and talent never wholly died out and he remained a somewhat dubious figure until the end of his career.
Shifai died in Lahore in July 2001.

Maringka Baker

Maringka Baker is an Aboriginal artist from central Australia. She lives in the Pitjantjatjara community of Kaṉpi, South Australia, and paints for Tjungu Palya, based in nearby Nyapaṟi. Maringka paints sacred stories from her family's Dreaming (spirituality). As well as the important cultural meanings they carry, her paintings are known for being rich in colour and contrast. She often paints the desert landscape in bright green colours, and contrasts it against reds and ochres to depict landforms. She also uses layers of contrasting colours to show the detail of the desert in full bloom.
Maringka was born in outback Western Australia around 1952. She was born at Kaliumpil, an old ceremonial and camping site on the Ngaanyatjarra lands. Her mother and father died when she was a young girl, and Maringka was brought up by Anmanari Brown and her other relatives. She went to primary school on the mission at Warburton, but ran away to join relatives in Ernabella. She later moved to Kaltjiti, where she finished high school and got a job as a teacher.
In the late 1960s, Maringka married a man from Papulankutja. They had a daughter, Elaine, in 1969. Maringka's husband died while Elaine was still a baby. Maringka became a health worker and she moved with her daughter to Irrunytju to work in the local clinic. In the 1980s, Maringka married Douglas Baker (nephew of Jimmy Baker), and they moved back east to live at Kaṉpi.
Maringka began painting in 2004. She paints for Tjungu Palya, a community arts centre based in nearby Nyapaṟi. She has become one of the centre's most well-known painters. Since 2005, Maringka's work has been exhibited in many cities around Australia, including Adelaide, Alice Springs, Broome, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. Overseas, her work has been shown in exhibitions in Singapore, Seattle and London. Her work is held in the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Australian National University, and the National Gallery of Victoria.
In 2007, Maringka was one of thirty artists featured in the first National Indigenous Art Triennial exhibition "Culture Warriors". It showed four of her paintings: "Anmangunga" (2006), "Kata Ala" (2006), "Ngura Mankurpa" (2006), and "Kuru Ala" (2007). The last of these, "Kuru Ala", is a depiction of a sacred women's site near Tjuntjuntjara that is associated with the creation story of the Seven Sisters (called Kungkarrakalpa in Pitjantjatjara). It was chosen as a finalist for the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2009, and is displayed in the National Gallery in Canberra.

Before he ascended the throne, Albert, Duke of York hated public speaking because he suffered from a severe stammer. His closing speech at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on 31 October 1925 proved that the speaker and listeners alike. The experience left the Duke resolved to find a way to manage his stammer, so he engaged Logue in 1926.
Diagnosing poor co-ordination between the Duke's larynx and thoracic diaphragm, Logue prescribed a daily hour of vocal exercises. Logue's treatment gave the Duke the confidence to relax and avoid tension-induced muscle spasms. As a result, he suffered only the occasional hesitancy in speech. By 1927, he was speaking confidently and managed his address at the opening of the Old Parliament House in Canberra without stammering.
Logue worked with the Duke through the 1930s and 40s. He used tongue-twisters to help his patient rehearse for major speeches, his coronation, and his radio broadcasts to the British Empire throughout the Second World War. The two men remained friends until the King's death.

<doc id="369225" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=369225" title="Designer drug">
Designer drug

Designer drugs are legal drugs that are made and sold to have the same effects as illegal drugs. These drugs are chemicals that change the way a person acts and feels. The government does not regulate designer drugs and this makes them dangerous to use.
Designer drugs were first sold in the United States around 1925. They were made because a lot of popular drugs were no longer allowed to be used. The government passed a law making drugs like morphine and heroin illegal, causing people to find new drugs. Ecstasy is another drug example. It was legal and used for psychotherapy until 1985 when it was banned. Since 2005, there are many more drugs like these being developed. Now there are designer drugs for several alternative drug groups. These drugs have a lot of different effects and people choose each one for different reasons.
There are different ways that these drugs effect the body. The user can smoke (breathe in), inject, sniff (breathe in the solid), or ingest (eat) the drugs. Once they are inside and in the bloodstream the drug changes the way chemicals are sent throughout the brain. By changing the messages sent, the brain will respond in a way specific to each drug. Some drugs and their effect will be felt in minutes and only last for a few hours. Other drugs will be felt in around an hour and then their effects can last up to several days. The amount of the drug taken can also change how strongly the user reacts to it. Too much of the drug can lead to drug tolerance. Drug tolerance is when the user has taken the drug for a long time and can no longer get the same effect from only taking a small amount of the drug. This will cause the person to take more of the drug to have the same effect. Doing this will eventually lead to an overdose. Designer drugs can be highly addictive so it can be hard to stop taking them in dangerous amounts.
Other names for designer drugs are "bath salts" or "plant food." The real chemicals in these drugs are mephedrone, methylone, and methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV). By writing "Not for human consumption (eating/drinking)" on the bags sellers are able to find a way around selling them online and in stores. Using labels like this help companies get around the Federal Analog Act which makes it illegal to sell drugs like these for human use.
Different types of these drugs include opioids, psychedelics, dissociatives, piperazine-based, entactogens, stimulants, sedatives, cannabinoids, and anabolic steroids. Not all of these drugs are sold as bath salts or designer drugs, but they can be. Sometimes these types of drugs can be used legally or as more serious illegal drugs. 
Because many of these drugs are new in many countries there are not laws regulating them. Recently, if a drug became illegal a new drug would be made that was similar to the original. 
In Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Sweden the government decides what to do with these drugs as problems come up. In Australia the government has not only banned all of these drugs but also drugs that have not been created yet. By banning the process and the use of chemicals that are similar to illegal drugs the government has tried to stop new drugs from developing. This law will not be able to stop new, original drugs from forming, though.
In the United States the Controlled Substances Act and the Controlled Substances Analogue Enforcement of 1986 both tried to make it a crime to make, sell, or own any drug that was chemically similar to an illegal drug.

Royal Birmingham Society of Artists

The Royal Birmingham Society of Artists (also called RBSA) is a group of artists who have a lot of experience and education. It is located in an area of Birmingham, England called the Jewellery Quarter. The RSBA has an art gallery there. It is a charity.
It was opened in 1821 and called the "Birmingham Society of Artists". They had an art gallery and office space located on New Street in 1829. They changed their name to the RBSA in 1868. It was very well known during the Victorian era. It had many famous artists of the time period such as William Morris. RBSA wanted to have an art school, but another art school, the Birmingham School of Art, opened in the area before RBSA could start one. In the late 20th century their original building was going to be destroyed. RBSA moved to an old warehouse. Charles, Prince of Wales opened the new gallery on 12 April 2000. The people who run the organization are named "President." They have all been artists.

The Game of the District Messenger Boy; or, Merit Rewarded is a board game published by McLoughlin Brothers in 1886. Players race their tokens around a track as lowly messenger boys. The first player to reach the Head of the Firm space at track's end is the winner. The game is one of the earliest American games to insinuate (suggest as truth) that social status is increased with the accumulation of wealth. Prior to its publication, Christian virtue as a means to a better life was the focus of American board games such as "The Mansion of Happiness". Variants of "District Messenger Boy" include "The Game of the Messenger Boy." Competitive, materialsitic board games culminated in 1935 with "Monopoly".

Aura (symptom)

An aura is the changes that people see, hear, smell, taste, or feel before they have an epileptic seizure, or before they have a migraine. It comes from the Greek word for breeze. The cause of the aura is related to the way the brain works, so this is a neurological condition.
There are different kinds of migraines. About 15% of people who have a migraine will have an aura. The symptoms may include visual problems like not being able to see for a short time, seeing zig-zag lines or floating spots, dizziness, a ringing noise in the ears (tinnitus), and problems speaking. It may take up to an hour after the aura begins before a person starts getting a migraine.
Many people with epilepsy have an aura before having a seizure. This can be helpful, because the aura can tell the person that a seizure is coming ahead of time, and give them time to get to a safe place. The time between the aura and the seizure is usually short (often from seconds to minutes).
There are other neurological conditions which can cause aura-like symptoms. These include strokes and panic attacks, for example. 
Scotoma (came from the Greek word for darkness: "skotos"): a "blind spot" or area of reduced vision surrounded by a normal visual field. i.e.: A person can see normally except where the scotoma is. Scotomas may affect one or both eyes. They can be either "absolute," where the person can see nothing within the scotoma, or "relative," where the person can see something within the scotoma, but less than usual.

Eupleridae

The family Eupleridae is a group of carnivores found in Madagascar. The family has of eight species and seven genera in two subfamilies. They live in a variety of habitats, from humid forests, marshes, bogs, and swamps, to deserts and savannas. 
The Euplerids are a clade. They are descendents of ancestors which rafted over from Africa about 20 million years ago (mya). They are closely related to mongooses. The fossa and the Malagasy civet ("Fossa fossana") are believed to be the most ancient surviving species in this group.
Euplerids usually have slender bodies with relatively small heads. Head and body length ranges from 250 mm to 800 mm. Euplerids are primarily carnivorous, eating small mammals, birds, reptiles, frogs, insects, crustaceans, and other invertebrates. "Fossa fossana" and "Galidia elegans" may also eat some fruit.
Fossas form monogamous pairs, while species in the genera "Galidia", "Mungotictis", and "Salanoia" live alone or in pairs, suggesting that they are monogamous for one breeding season only. "Mungotictis" individuals live in small groups with several adults of each sex, but it is not known if all of the adults in a group breed. "Cryptoprocta" only live alone, suggesting a polygynous or polygynandrous mating system.
Euplerids have definite breeding seasons. Each species' season is different and lasts from two to eight months. Gestation lasts around three months. Usually, just one or two young are born per litter, though Cryptoprocta can have up to four. Weaning takes place between two and four and a half months. 
All species in this family are threatened. The main causes are loss of habitat and hunting by humans or dogs. (IUCN 2006)

League of Legends

League of Legends is a free to play online computer game created by Riot Games. It was inspired by a user-created "Warcraft 3" mod called Defense of the Ancients. It is, as of 2013, the most played computer game in the world with over 32 million active users per month.
In "League of Legends" you can control 1 of 131 'champions' and team up with either one to four other players to fight another team of the same size. The two teams fight to destroy each others' base structure, called a Nexus. The most popular map, Summoner's Rift, is split into three lanes with three turrets and an inhibitor on each. Players must destroy each turret in any particular lane before they can attack the Nexus. The Nexus also spawns AI controlled minions for each team, who move forward and attack the first enemy champion,minion or turret they see. These minions, and enemy players, can be killed by the players to gain gold which can be spent on items to further improve their champion.
Between each lane are paths where neutral monsters spawn, called the "jungle". Either side can kill these monsters to gain gold, experience and buffs.
Each champion has three normal abilities and an ultimate ability. Killing minions, jungle monsters and enemy champions gives experience and when a certain amount is reached the champion 'levels up' and the player can spend a point to improve one of their abilities. There are 18 levels and points can be spent in any order. However, these points cannot be used to buy ultimate abilities which are only unlocked for improvement at levels 6, 11 and 16.
Player experience and intelligence points are earned by playing matches over time. Player accounts begin at level one. The maximum level of an account is 30. On leveling up, players unlock new maps. They also unlock abilities called summoner spells that can be used in game, as well as Runes and Masteries. These provide small bonuses during the game.
Ultra Rapid Fire (U.R.F.) is a limited time game mode in League Of Legends (LoL). The game mode usually comes in each year for only around 1 or 2 weeks, however, as of 2016, Riot has released a system called the Featured Game Mode Queue, which brings back a limited game mode queue every Friday through Monday. The game mode contains a buff called Awesome Buff of Awesomely Awesome Buffing. It gives 80% cool down on all abilities, "summoner spells" (spells chosen before the game starts which allow the player to do other things besides things their champion can do), and some passive effects and active abilities on champions and certain items. All the mana (in game resource that most champions use to cast abilities that regenerates over time) that you'll use from the abilities will not be affected at all. All champion abilities will be free, also same as energy (another resources used by the champions Shen, Kennen, Akali, and Zed.)
Blood Well, Fury and Flow (resources used by Aatrox, Renekton, and Yasuo respectively) generation is doubled from all sources; and Health costs (as some champions use their own health as resources) are reduced by 50%.
Abilities with static cooldowns (cooldowns that depend on something else), such as Sweeping Blade (Yasuo), Missile Barrage (Corki), Dragon's Descent (used by Shyvana) and the global cooldown on Udyr's abilities will not benefit from the 80% cooldown reduction bonus.
The only exceptions to this are the revive passives of Aatrox, Anivia and Zac, which are set to a 60 second cooldown.
Benefits of the Awesome Buff of Awesomely Awesome Buffing:
Attack speed : Bonus attack speed from items, runes, masteries, etc. is doubled for ranged champions and × 1.5 for melee champions.
Movement speed : +60 for all champions
Tenacity : +25% for all champions
Critical strike damage : +25% for all champions.
Gold Income : × 5 gain for all champions 
Basically all these AWESOME BUFF OF AWESOMELY AWESOME BUFFING buffs let you have even more fun in the summoner's rift.
New System: ROTATING GAME MODE QUEUE
Hexakill
"2014 started with a Featured Game Mode meta changeup. With the original Hexakill, we wanted to try exploring a new space that modes hadn’t really touched yet at that point. The end result was the closest we’d ever brushed up against the ‘regular Summoner’s Rift meta’, but with the twist of an extra player. Our goal was to still preserve the feel of Summoner’s Rift, but change up how you interacted with your champion and played within the map’s meta.
Ultra Rapid Fire (U.R.F.)
Originally planned as an April Fool’s Day joke intended only to last one day, we were blown away by the response Ultra Rapid Fire received. Based on the response from players around the world in multiple regions and languages, we extended the length of the mode (twice). Who doesn’t like making more plays?! URF also taught us a fantastic lesson about the novelty of game modes over time and the cost of ongoing maintenance. Featured Gameplay Modes have been shown to taper off in popularity sharply after a short period of time. People often forget that URF actually broke our golden rule of not touching Featured Gameplay Modes post-launch, but to try and keep it from becoming stale in the face of wildly toxic champion play patterns, we did anyway. And yet, despite our consecutive on the run tweaks to keep URF treading water balance-wise, we still saw the same declining engagement and burnout that we see with other modes. That doesn’t mean players don’t have a blast with each mode like this before they fade away. However, being designed as a can of whoopass in the first place ultimately means that the flame burns twice as bright and half as long. And that’s okay!
One For All Mirror Mode
One For All Mirror
The original One For All was one of more heavily played modes we made in 2013. Before it was even released though, some enterprising players hacked their clients and were hosting ad-hoc games of One For All on Howling Abyss. After the mode’s first outing on Summoner’s Rift, many players heavily requested that we bring the mode back on Howling Abyss to replicate their ad-hoc games, so we got to work on the resurrection. In the end, One For All: Mirror Mode may have lost a lot of the strategic choice of Summoner’s Rift (naturally absent on Howling Abyss where your only option is to “push”). By homogenising both teams into the same champion, we also lost the nuance in gameplay between two champion’s kits. Engagement with the mode proved out that this maybe wasn’t the best experiment, but that’s what learning is for!
We also learned a lesson about the cost of resurrecting a mode. Each time we bring a mode back, along with any improvements or additions we might want to make, time has to be spent QA'ing it against the latest patch release (one of the costs of having a game that evolves constantly). For example: The original One For All required about 80 champions to be hand edited to work with the mode's mechanics. When we wanted to bring it back as One For All: Mirror Mode, about 35 champions had changed since the last time (yay champ updates and improvements!) which required another whole round of editing, plus entirely new champions had been released. If we ever made a mode permanent, we’d need to weigh the impact this would have on the ability to create new modes VS maintaining existing modes.
The map change isn’t always necessary though. Sometimes smoothing over the experience and some bug fixes could generate the original experience we were looking for. URF would be nice simply to not have 9 champions disabled. It always depends on the mode.
Hexakill Twisted Treeline
After the first outing of Hexakill and the warm reception it received, we felt like it was a good candidate to bring back. As with One For All: Mirror Mode though, we don’t want to just resurrect the exact same mode from last time. We wanted to turn up the volume on the design goals of the original Hexakill (being to shake up how you think about and execute on established meta on a given map). That led us to port the mode over to the Twisted Treeline. This is a good example of how we want to improve modes each time before we re-release them.
What do you mean by “improve a mode before re-releasing it”? It depends on the mode, but it’s always heavily informed by player feedback. In the case of Hexakill, we wanted that exaggeration of the original design intention. Hexakill on SR just wasn’t different enough; going from 5 to only 6 players didn’t really make you change the way you played that much. Twisted Treeline felt much higher impact because we were essentially doubling the player count on the map.
Legend of the Poro King was seeking to change the way players thought about combat on the Howling Abyss. That we were able to introduce everyone to the grandest most splendiferous King of all the Poro’s himself was just an added bonus.
I want to call out the Poro Toss summoner spell here as well, which gave an across-the-board bump in viability to some historically unpopular picks. Even with picking your champs, engage from the Poro Toss summoner spell was able to wing clip the power of some notoriously strong Howling Abyss champs. It was an overall healthier experience, seeing good champion diversity and lots of big plays."

Minkowski spacetime

In special relativity, the Minkowski spacetime is a four-dimensional manifold, created by Hermann Minkowski. It has four dimensions: three dimensions of space (x, y, z) and one dimension of time. Minkowski spacetime has a metric signature of (-+++) and is always flat. The convention in this article is to call Minkowski spacetime simply spacetime. 
However, Minkowski spacetime only applies in special relativity. General relativity used the notion of curved spacetime to describe the effects of gravity and accelerated motion.
Spacetime can be thought of as a four-dimensional coordinate system in which the axes are given by 
formula_1
They can also be denoted by
formula_2
Where formula_3 represents formula_4. The reason for measuring time in units of the speed of light times the time coordinate is so that the units for time are the same as the units for space. Spacetime has the differential for arc length given by
formula_5
This implies that spacetime has a metric tensor given by
formula_6
As before stated, spacetime is flat everywhere; to some extent, it can be thought of as a plane. 
Spacetime can be thought of as the "arena" in which all of the events in the universe take place. All that one needs to specify a point in spacetime is a certain time and a typical spatial orientation. It is hard (virtually impossible) to visualize four dimensions, but some analogy can be made, using the method below.
Hermann Minkowski introduced a certain method for graphing coordinate systems in Minkowski spacetime. As seen to the right, different coordinate systems will disagree on an object's spatial orientation and/or position in time. As you can see from the diagram, there is only one spatial axis (the x-axis) and one time axis (the ct-axis). If need be, one can introduce an extra spatial dimension, (the y-axis); unfortunately, this is the limit to the number of dimensions: graphing in four dimensions is impossible. The rule for graphing in Minkowski spacetime goes as follows:
1) The angle between the x-axis and the x'-axis is given by formula_7 where v is the velocity of the object
2) The speed of light through spacetime "always" makes an angle of 45 degrees with either axis.
In the general theory of relativity, Einstein used the equation
formula_8
To allow for spacetime to actually curve; the resulting effects are those of gravity.

Diane Pretty

Diane Pretty (15 November 1958 - 11 May 2002) was a British woman who became known for a debate on laws of euthanasia. She had attempted to change British law so she could end her own life because of the pains and problems of the terminal illness motor neurone disease.
Over time, the disease worsened and made it impossible for her to move or communicate easily even though her mental faculties remained normal. The illness resulted in her having to be looked after continuously by her husband and nurses. Pretty took her case to court using the Human Rights Act to argue not to prosecute anybody involved in helping her to die. British courts did not accept Pretty's arguments, with the House of Lords eventually turning her case down. The European Court of Human Rights refused to acknowledge that the European Convention on Human Rights provided a right to die, and her appeal to that court also failed. She died aged 43, as a result of her condition.

Megaevolution

Megaevolution is a term which describes the most dramatic events in evolution. By that is not meant a different kind of evolution; rather, it means evolution which produces a tremendous effect. It is not suggested that the evolutionary processes involved are special although, in some cases they might be. Since the word 'macroevolution' can apply to relatively modest changes at the species and genus level, 'megaevolution' may be used for really huge changes.
The adaptive radiation of birds in the Lower Cretaceous, teleosts in the Cretaceous, flowering plants in the Upper Cretaceous, mammals in the Eocene, moths in the Cretaceous are striking examples of macroevolution. However, there are even more important events in the history of life. An interesting list was prepared by Maynard Smith and Szathmáry, which they called the major transitions in evolution. They did the list twice.
Some of these topics have been discussed before.
Numbers one to six on the list are about events which are of huge importance, but about which we know relatively little. All occurred before (and mostly very much before) the fossil record started, or at least before the Phanerozoic eon.
Numbers seven and eight on the list are of a different kind from the first six, and are generally not considered by the other authors. Number four is of a type which is not covered by traditional evolutionary theory, The origin of eukaryotic cells is probably due to symbiosis between prokaryotes. This is a kind of evolution which must be a rare event.
The Cambrian explosion or Cambrian radiation was the relatively rapid appearance of most major animal phyla around 530 million years ago (mya) in the fossil record. It is the classic example of megaevolution. "The fossil record documents two mutually exclusive macroevolutionary modes separated by the transitional Ediacaran period".
Before about 580 mya it seems that most organisms were simple. They were made of individual cells occasionally organized into colonies. Over the following 70 or 80 million years the rate of evolution accelerated by an order of magnitude. Normally rates of evolution are measured by the extinction and origination rate of species, but here we can say that by the end of the Cambrian every phylum, or almost every phylum, existed. 
The diversity of life began to resemble that of today.
The Cambrian explosion has caused much scientific debate. The seemingly rapid appearance of fossils in the 'primordial strata' was noted as early as the mid 19th century, and Charles Darwin saw it as one of the main objections that could be made against his theory of evolution by natural selection.

Deep Impact (space mission)

Deep Impact was a NASA space mission to study comets. It was sent out to meet Comet Tempel 1, and to crash a smaller space rocket deep into the comet's surface. 
Deep Impact was launched on January 12, 2005 from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket used was a Boeing Delta II. It reached the comet in July 2005, from Earth. After taking photos, the impactor spacecraft was sent to crash into the surface on July 4, 2005. This created a huge crater and blasted parts of the comet into space. Deep Impact was able to study this debris which included ice and dust from deep inside the comet. This has helped scientists understand what comets are made of.
From the explosion scientists discovered that the comet had water ice both on the surface and deep inside. One scientist described it as being like a "...skating rink of snowy dirt." They were able to work out the comet was formed in the area between Uranus and Neptune.
After the mission, NASA decided to send Deep Impact to study the Comet 85P/Boethin. However the comet did not return on its expected 11 year path around the sun, and has not been seen since.

Scientists were able to study the debris from the explosion to discover what the comet was made from. They discovered that part of the comet was covered in water ice which made it like a skating rink. This was the first time that evidence of water had been found on a comet.

Boeing Launch Services supplies Delta II rockets to private companies.
The Delta II rockets were based on the Thor rockets built in the 1950's. These were used to carry Inter Continental Ballistic Missiles. The first Thor was launched on January 26, 1957. The Delta II rocket was first launched on February 14, 1989. The rocket was developed after the explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1986. The US Air Force needed another way to launch its GPS satellites. As of 2011, there have been 128 Delta II launches from both Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and the Vandenburg Air Force Base. Only two launches have been unsuccessful. In August 1995, a rocket motor failure meant the Koreasat 1 was put into a lower orbit, and in January 1997 Delta 241 carrying a GPS satellite exploded 13 seconds after taking off. However, since then, the Delta II has had 98 successful launches in a row.

Bell's palsy

Bell's palsy is a paralysis of the face on one side. It is caused by inflammation of a facial nerve. The sufferer cannot move the muscles on the affected side of the face. 
Several conditions can cause facial paralysis, such as brain tumors, strokes, and Lyme disease. Bell's palsy is named after Scottish anatomist Charles Bell. Bell first described the disease. It is the most common acute disease involving only one nerve, and it is the most common cause of sudden facial nerve paralysis.
Bell's palsy involves a rapid start of partial or complete paralysis that often occurs overnight. Scientists believe that inflammation leads to swelling of the facial nerve. The nerve travels through the skull in a narrow bone canal beneath the ear. Nerve swelling and compression in the narrow bone canal are thought to stop the nerve from working. At times of lowered immunity, a dormant (sleeping) virus, usually the chicken pox or cold sore virus, can wake up and attack the nerve causing it to swell. The main symptoms of Bell's palsy are one-sided facial paralysis, jaw pain, dizziness, strengthened hearing in one ear, and weakened taste sense.
Bell's palsy usually cures itself, sometimes in a few weeks. Corticosteroids (cortisone steroids) have been found to improve the condition while anti-viral drugs have not. Early treatment is necessary for steroids or drugs to be effective, but it is controversial wether or not they work. Most people recover spontaneously and achieve near-normal to normal functions. Some people however will never regain full facial movement, or it may take a longer time. Many show signs of improvement as early as 10 days after the onset, even without treatment.
Often those suffering from Bell's palsy cannot close the eye in the affected side. The eye must be protected from drying up, or the cornea may be permanently damaged. The affected eye may need to be taped shut when sleeping.

Jimmy Baker

Jimmy Baker (born as Pintjutjara; about 1915 – 20 April 2010) was an Australian Aboriginal artist.
Jimmy Baker was born some time around 1915. He was born at Malumpa, an old camping site near what is now Kaṉpi in north-western South Australia. His name at the time was Pintjutjara. He had a brother, Toby Ginger Baker, and a sister, Tjuwilya. He and his family lived a traditional, nomadic life in the desert, and had no contact with Euro-Australian society. Their first encounter with White people was in the early 1920s, with a group of Christian missionaries travelling from Ernabella to Warburton. On their way back, the missionaries tried to persuade the family to come with them to Ernabella, but Jimmy's father, Tjuwintjara, was not ready to give up life in the bush.
When Jimmy was a teenager, his father encountered an expedition led by anthropologist Ted Strehlow. Strehlow gave Tjuwintjara food in exchange for his help as a guide. Strehlow also gave the family a letter that entitled them to access the food stores at Ernabella. Because of this, the family decided to leave the desert behind, and they finally settled at Ernabella a short time after 1930.
Jimmy's father remained very traditional. He was well known for his survival skills and knowledge of the desert. In 1939, he acted as a guide for Strehlow and Charles Duguid on their expedition to the Petermann Ranges.
At Ernabella, Jimmy's first job was baking bread. Because of this, he was given the surname "Baker", and he chose the Christian name of "Jimmy" himself. Later, he got a job building fences on nearby stations, first at Kenmore Park and then Everard Park. In the late 1930s, Jimmy got married to a woman named Nyinmungka, who he met while working at Everard Park. The two of them moved back to Kenmore Park to live. They had one son and two daughters: Anton, Kay and Marita. All of Jimmy's children became artists and founding members of the Tjunga Palya centre.
In his later years, Jimmy became an important "ngangkaṟi" (traditional healer). He travelled far around central Australia, applying his traditional knowledge and skills. He and his wife lived in Kaltjiti, but Jimmy wanted to move closer to his family's homeland near Malumpa. In the early 1990s, he and two of his nephews, Ivan and Douglas Baker, established Kaṉpi as an outstation for their families.
Jimmy did not begin painting until 2004, six years before his death. Until about the 1980s, men's traditional art was widely considered sacred by Pitjantjatjara, and was not displayed in public like women's art was. Pintupi men in the north began painting in the 1970s, at Papunya Tula. This was considered sacrilege by other Western Desert groups, because knowledge of sacred law is considered dangerous. The sacred images in the paintings were obscured, though, and encrypted (hidden) by dots and lines. When the art style became popular, more and more Pitjantjatjara men began to paint.
Baker began painting as a way to preserve his stories and culture. Because he was a "ngangkaṟi", he knew more about his country's sacred Dreaming stories than most. His paintings represent stories from the time of creation that dictate sacred law ("Tjukurpa") for Pitjantjatjara people. Although he began very late in life, his paintings quickly became well known. The first major exhibition to show his work was an annual group exhibition called "Desert Mob", in Alice Springs. It first featured his work in 2005, and again every year after that until 2009. In 2007, Baker was one of thirty artists featured in the first National Indigenous Art Triennial exhibition "Culture Warriors". It showed three of his paintings: "Katatjita" (2006), "Wanampi Kutjara" (2006) and "Piltati" (2007). He was interviewed on South Australian television, speaking through a translator.
Having only painted for six years, Baker produced only a small number of works. His works are rare, and were considered valuable even when he was alive. Most of them are acrylic paintings done on canvas (cotton duck). He uses rich colours in the "dot" style that has become classical in Western Desert art.
Jimmy died in 2010, from a problem with his lungs. His work is major several major public and private collections in Australia, including the Art Gallery of South Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria, and the National Gallery of Australia. As well as his children, several of his grandchildren are also well-known artists painting for Tjungu Palya.

If an item is produced in large quantities, this is usually called mass production. The item produced is called product, and it is usually made in a factory. The items produced will all be the same type. The process of making large quantities will usually require the use of standardized products or product groups. It also depends heavily on interchangeable parts.
Today, machines are often used to mass produce such items. Using division of labour, a greater number of items can be produced. Adam Smith used the example of a needle: With division of labour, it is possible to produce more needles in the same time. Frederick Winslow Taylor, the father of Taylorism also used the division of labour: he wanted to divide the tasks into planning tasks, and execution.

Keel-billed Toucan

The Keel-billed Toucan ("Ramphastos sulfuratus"), also known as Sulfur-breasted Toucan or Rainbow-billed Toucan, is a colorful Latin American member of the toucan family. It is the national bird of Belize.
The Keel-billed Toucan can be found from Southern Mexico to Venezuela and Colombia. 
Like many toucans, Keel-billed is a very social bird, rarely seen alone. It travels in small flocks of about six to twelve individuals through lowland rainforests. It is a poor flyer, and moves mostly by hopping through trees. 
Including its bill, the Keel-billed Toucans ranges in length from around 17 to 22 inches (42–55 cm). Their large and colorful bill averages around 5-6 in (12–15 cm). This is about one-third of its length. It weighs about 380-500 grams (13.4 oz.-1.1 lbs.) While the bill seems large and weighty, it is in fact a spongy, hollow bone covered in keratin, a very light and hard protein. 
The feathers of the Keel-billed Toucan are mostly black with a yellow neck and chest. Molting happens once per year. It has blue feet and red feathers at the tip of its tail. The bill is mostly green with a red tip and orange sides.
Keel-billed toucans have two toes that face forward and two that face back. Because toucans spend a large part of time in the trees, this helps the birds to stay on the branches of the trees and hop from one branch to another.
Keel-billed Toucans eat mostly a wide range of fruit, but may also eat insects, eggs, and reptiles. When eating fruit, it uses its bill to take apart the fruit, and then tosses its head back to swallow the fruit whole.
The female Keel-billed Toucan will lay 1-4 white eggs in a natural or already-made tree cavity. The male and female share in the caring of the eggs, both taking turns incubating. The eggs hatch about 15–20 days after being laid. After hatching, the male and female take turns feeding the chicks. When the chicks hatch, they have no feathers, and have their eyes closed for about 3 weeks. The chicks stay in their nest for eight to nine weeks while their bills develop fully.

First order logic

First order logic is type of logic, which is used in certain branches of mathematics and philosophy. First order logic allows to define a syntax which is independent of the mathematical or logical terms. In first order logic, reasoning can be done from two points of view: either using syntax alone, or including semantic terms. First order logic is different from predicate calculus: In first order logic, there are "quantifiers", called "for all" and "there is at least one". Negation, conjunction inclusive disjunction, exclusive disjunction and implication are the same as those in predicate calculus. Together with Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, first order logic is the foundation of many branches of mathematics today.

Tiger Palpatja

Tiger Palpatja (born about 1920 – died 16 April 2012) was an Australian Aboriginal artist from the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands.
Tiger was born around 1920 (though the exact year is not known). He was born in the bush, at a rockhole called Piltati, which is close to what is now Nyapaṟi in north-west South Australia. His family were Pitjantjatjara, and they lived a traditional, nomadic life in the bushland around Piltati. When he was a teenager, Tiger's family settled at Ernabella, which at the time was a Presbyterian mission and a sheep station. Tiger grew up on the mission, and learned to speak a little English in school there. He eventually got married to a woman named Nyalapanytja, and they lived in Ernabella for many years. Tiger worked on the station, shearing sheep and building fences.
In the 1970s, Tiger and his family moved to Amaṯa, closer to his homeland. When he got older, Tiger became a "ngangkaṟi" (traditional healer), an important and respected role in traditional Pitjantjatjara communities. In 1997, the women at Amaṯa began a community art centre, originally called Minymaku Arts. The word "minymaku" means "women's", and they called it this because, at the time, Pitjantjatjara men did not like to paint. After several men began painting in the early 2000s, the centre's name was changed to Tjala Arts.
Tiger started painting in September 2004, less than eight years before his death. He had never painted before this, and was better known for woodworking, especially making spears. Although he only began painting in his final years, his work quickly became recognised by critics. In 2005, Tiger was a finalist for the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award. He became a finalist three more time before his death, in 2006, 2010, and 2011, but he never won. He was also a finalist in the Western Australian Indigenous Art Awards in 2009, and again in 2011. Tiger mainly painted for Tjala Arts, but from 2009 he also began working for Tjungu Palya in nearby Nyapaṟi.
Tiger's painted sacred stories from his Dreaming, mostly to do with Piltati, where he was born. This place is associated with a creation story involving two sisters and their husbands, who change themselves into Wanampi (a giant water snake). According to Tiger's Dreaming, the Wanampi are his family's ancestors who created the country around Piltati. The snake's form can be seen in many of Tiger's paintings, usually painted several different colours. His paintings were known for their bright colours, as opposed to the traditional natural ochre colours used by many other artists of the Western Desert.
Tiger died on 16 April 2012, over the age of 90. While he was alive, his paintings were exhibited in several major cities, including Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Fremantle and Perth. His work is now held in permanent galleries in most of these cities. He also had work exhitied overseas: at the University of Virginia in 2006, and in Singapore in 2008. His paintings are held in the National Gallery of Victoria, the National Gallery of Australia, the Australian National University, Charles Darwin University, Flinders University, and the Art Gallery of New South Wales.

Bit (horse)

A bit is a type of equipment that is put in a horse's mouth to help control it. It is attached to a bridle to hold it on the horse's head, and to reins which the rider holds and allows them to control and cue the horse. The mouthpiece of the bit is the part that goes into the horses mouth. It is usually made of metal, but may also be made of plastic or rubber.
There are many different types of bits, including snaffles, pelhams, and curb bits. They all work a little differently. Some bits are "softer" than others, meaning that a pull on it is gentler to the horse than a "harsh" bit. For example, bits with a smooth mouthpiece are soften than those with a twisted mouthpiece. Bits are not cruel when used correctly, but a rider that pulls too hard can hurt a horse's mouth, especially if they use a harsh bit. If a rider is inexperienced, they should ride with a softer bit so when they make mistakes they do not hurt the horse. Experienced riders who can follow the horse's mouth as the horse moves and give very slight cues can use bits that are harsher. They have the skill to use the bits for very fine control over the horse, without hurting it. 
Certain bits are commonly used in certain horse activities. For example, western style riding usually uses a curb bit. English style usually uses a type of snaffle, although certain horses may be put in a different type of bit. Saddleseat riding and high levels of dressage riding use a double bridle. This is a bridle that holds 2 bits. Each bit works a little differently so the rider can cue the horse to do different things. The rider must ride with 2 reins in each hand. This requires the rider to be skilled so they can handle both reins without confusing the horse.

The organisation was founded in 1964 as the River Niger Commission. On 21 November 1980, it was refounded as the Niger Basin Authority.
Nine nations are members: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Nigeria. While a small area of Algeria is in the Niger Basin, it is not a member of the NBA. The organisation is based in Niamey. They work in both French and English.

Slave Coast

The Slave Coast is the name of the coastal areas of present Togo, Benin (formerly Dahomey) and western Nigeria. This is a fertile region of coastal Western Africa along the Bight of Benin. In pre-colonial times it was one of the most densely populated parts of the African continent. It was one of the most important places for the Atlantic slave trade from the early 16th century to the 19th century.
The slave trade became so large in the 18th and 19th centuries that an “Atlantic community” was formed. Slaves went to the New World, mostly to Brazil and the Caribbean. Ports that exported these slaves from Africa include Ouidah, Lagos, Aného (Little Popo), Grand-Popo, Agoué, Jakin, Porto-Novo, and Badagry.
Researchers think that between 2 and 3 million slaves were exported out of this region. They were traded for goods like alcohol and tobacco from the Americas and textiles from Europe. Religions, architectural styles, languages, knowledge, and other new goods were mixed at this time.
After slavery was ended by European countries, the slave trade continued for a time with independent traders (instead of government agents).

Zinc finger

Zinc finger nucleases (or ZFN) are a tool used to target genes and change DNA. It is one of three methods of changing the genome with engineered nucleases.
They have two parts. Zinc fingers are man-made molecules made of a protein and zinc. Each binds to a specific DNA. Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) are enzymes got by fusing a zinc finger to a DNA cleavage enzyme called a "Fokl". So the ZFN binds onto a specific DNA sequence, then snips it in two places. Regular cell enzymes stick the ends together, minus the bit snipped out (DNA repair).
Each ZFN is made to use on a single gene which is called a “target gene” or “target DNA”. They can be designed to work on specific parts of genes to create a desired change. The two types of DNA changes are mutations such as deletions and insertions. Genetics research looks at mutated animal subjects to find out what the particular gene does.
'Zinc finger' is the name of many protein structures. The zinc atom binds the proteins and makes them more stable. ZFNs bind to DNA base pairs. One zinc finger can bind about 3 base pairs by itself. 
Zinc finger nucleases are made with 3-6 zinc fingers. ZFNs have two important domains: a DNA-binding domain and a DNA-cleavage domain. The DNA-cleavage domain uses an enzyme called "Fokl" that breaks DNA. 
ZFN’s can only change DNA sequences they are designed for. The DNA-binding domain binds to a specific DNA sequence. Two ZFN’s designed for the same DNA sequence are needed change one gene. The DNA-binding domains bind to both strands on the DNA double helix. DNA-cleaving domains break the DNA strand and cut the gene base pairs out. Cells fix broken DNA strands on their own using DNA repair. Deletion mutations result from missing base pairs after DNA repair. 
The length of target gene sequence can also be specified. A minimum of 9 base pairs can be changed using 3 zinc fingers. This is useful for removing and inserting very short DNA sequences and determining their effect on the target gene. Also large sequences can be changed using more than one ZFN. 
ZFNs have been used to discover gene functions in many genetics studies. ZFNs can be used to change DNA on any species. Another feature of ZFNs is that they can be used "in vivo" (in living organisms). They are currently used on model organisms: plants, insects, and fish. 
A list of organisms involved in ZFN gene altering research includes:
The biggest issue with ZFNs is accidentally altering genes besides the target gene. A ZFN must be made to find the right base pairs on the target gene. These base pairs are chosen so only the target gene will have them. DNA-cleavage domains work on any DNA sequence so binding to a wrong gene sequence will change it instead. ZFNs that knock out base pairs for more than one gene are not considered accurate.

The W Regional Park is a major national park in West Africa. It is formed around a meander in the River Niger shaped like a "W". The park includes areas of the three countries Niger, Benin and Burkina Faso.
The W National Park of Niger was formed by decree on 4 August 1954. In 1996 it was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
In the three nations, the Regional park covers about 10,000 km². Almost no people live in this area.
The park is known for its large mammals, including aardvarks, baboons, buffalo, caracal, cheetahs, elephants, hippopotamuses, leopards, lions, serval and warthogs. The park has a home for some of West Africa's last wild African Elephants. The W Park used to have packs of the endangered Painted Hunting Dog. The National Park is one of the last strongholds for the Northwest African cheetah. There is a small but increasing population of at least 15-25 animals of this rare cat in the park. 
The W area is also known for its bird populations. There are over 350 species identified in the park.

Spring (device)

A spring is a device typically made of metal, usually steel. 
The metal can be compressed (squeezed). When the compression force is removed, the spring returns to its original length. The metal is usually spring steel, and it is wound tightly. There is lot of varitions with size and type, example some springs have designed for pulling, not pushing. Gas-springs are often used with vehicles tailgate.
Simple non-coiled springs were used throughout human history e.g., the bow (and arrow). In the Bronze Age more sophisticated spring devices were used, as shown by the spread of tweezers in many cultures. Ctesibius of Alexandria developed a method for making bronze with spring-like characteristics by producing an alloy of bronze with an increased proportion of tin, and then hardening it by hammering after it is cast.
Coiled springs appeared early in the 15th century, in door locks. The first spring powered-clocks appeared in that century. They evolved into the first large watches by the 16th century.
In 1676 British physicist Robert Hooke discovered the principle behind springs' action, that the force it exerts is proportional to its extension, now called Hooke's law.

<doc id="370060" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=370060" title="The Fens">
The Fens

The Fens, or , are a naturally marshy region in eastern England. Most of the fens were drained several centuries ago. They are now mostly a flat, damp, low-lying agricultural region.
A "fen" is an individual area of marshland or former marshland. The marsh is (or was) neutral or alkaline water with relatively large quantities of dissolved minerals, but few other plant nutrients.
The Fenland is mostly around the coast of the Wash. It includes parts of four counties: Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and a small area of Suffolk. The whole occupies an area of nearly .
Most of the Fenland lies within a few metres of sea level. As with similar areas in the Netherlands, much of the Fenland originally consisted of fresh- or salt-water wetlands, which have been artificially drained and continue to be protected from floods by drainage banks and pumps. With the support of this drainage system, the Fenland has become a major arable agricultural region in Britain for grains and vegetables. The Fens are particularly fertile, containing around half of the grade 1 agricultural land in England.
The Fens include the churches and cathedrals of Ely, Ramsey, Crowland, Thorney and Peterborough.
Other significant settlements in the Fens include Cambridge, Boston, Spalding, Wisbech and King's Lynn.
The Fens are very low-lying compared with the chalk and limestone uplands that surround them – in most places no more than 10 m above sea level. Indeed, as a result of drainage and the subsequent shrinkage of the peat fens, many parts of the Fens now lie below the average sea level. Although one writer in the seventeenth century described the Fenland as all lying above sea level (in contrast to the Netherlands), the area is now home to the lowest land point in the United Kingdom, Holme Fen in Cambridgeshire, at around 2.75 metres below sea level. Within the Fens there are a few hills, which have historically been called "islands" as they remained dry when the low-lying fens around them were flooded. The largest of the fen-islands is the Isle of Ely, on which the cathedral city of Ely was built; its highest point is 39 m above mean sea-level.
Without artificial drainage and flood protection, the Fens would be liable to periodic flooding, particularly in winter due to the heavy load of water flowing down from the uplands and overflowing the rivers. Some areas of the Fens were once permanently flooded, creating small lakes or "meres", while others were only flooded during periods of high water. In the pre-modern period arable farming was limited to the higher areas of the surrounding uplands, the fen islands and the so-called "Townlands", an arch of silt ground around the Wash where the towns had their arable fields. Though these lands were lower than the peat fens before the peat shrinkage began, the more stable silt soils were reclaimed by medieval farmers and embanked against any floods coming down from the peat areas or from the sea. The rest of the Fenland was dedicated to pastoral farming, fishing, fowling and the harvesting of reeds or sedge, for example for thatch. In this way, the medieval and early modern Fens stood in contrast to the rest of southern England, which was primarily an arable agricultural region.
Since the advent of modern drainage in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the Fens have been radically transformed, so that today arable farming has almost entirely replaced pastoral and the economy of the Fens is heavily invested in the production of crops such as grains, vegetables and some cash crops such as rapeseed or canola.

Cult suicide

An incident where all members of a group considered a cult kill themselves has been called a cult suicide. In some cases, all or nearly all members commit suicide at the same time and place. Very often, this has been arranged as a mass suicide.
Groups that have committed such mass suicides and that have been called cults include Heaven's Gate, Order of the Solar Temple, and Peoples Temple. There are other cases, where the respective group has supported mass suicide, but where it did not encourage all members to kill themselves. An example for such a case is that of the Filippians.

Destructive cult

A destructive cult is a cult or other religious movement which has caused harm to its members or other people, or which will likely do so. There is a discussion of what "harm" really means in this context. For most researchers, it includes "physical harm", so organisations who injure or kill their members qualify.
Some researchers also include mental abuse in this notion of harm, for example: "A destructive cult is a pyramid-shaped authoritarian regime with a person or group of people that have dictatorial control. It uses deception in recruiting new members (e.g. people are NOT told up front what the group is, what the group actually believes and what will be expected of them if they become members". Psychologist Michael Langone defines a destructive cult as "a highly manipulative group which exploits and sometimes physically and/or psychologically damages members and recruits". Lifton's "Eight criteria for thought reform" are criteria to identify a destructive cult. 
The use of the term "destructive cult" has also been criticised. According to some researchers, the term has been used to describe groups which are not necessarily harmful to themselves or others. The term may be used too widely, and equated with the deaths of members of Peoples Temple at Jonestown. Some complain that the term has been used to discredit groups. Lorne L. Dawson writes that though the Unification Church "has not been shown to be violent or volatile," it has been described as a destructive cult by "anticult crusaders". 
The German Federal Constitutional Court ruled in 2002, that the German government defamed the Osho movement by referring to it, among other things, as a "destructive cult". The court decided that "destructive cult" and other expressions employed by the government to describe the group had no factual basis to justify their use.

<doc id="370067" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=370067" title="Doomsday cult">
Doomsday cult

A doomsday cult is a new religious movement or cult that says that the world is about to end. According to these cults, there will be a catastrophe. The only way to be saved is by joining the group, and by doing what it says. John Lofland first used the term in 1966, in a study of the Unification Church. Some researchers believe that the term should not be used by mass media or by governments, because it will reinforce the beliefs of the respective group, and lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
Examples of groups said to be doomsday cults include the Peoples Temple, the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, and Aum Shinrikyo. Aum Shinrikyo was responsible for an Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995, where thirteen people died. The People's Temple organised a forced mass suicide in Guyana, at a facility now known as "Jonestown", where over 900 people died. The Movement for the Restoration of the Ten commandments predicted the end of the world would be on the 31st December 1999. When it did not come, people in the movement became sceptical, and wanted thir property back, which they had donated to the church leader beforehand. At a religious service on 17th March 2000, the church where the service was held was put on fire, and 530 people died. During the equiry, the police found other people dead, at the properties of the movement; they had likely been poisoned. In total, over 1000 people had died. The leader of the movement survived, and has not been seen since then. 
In "Globalisation and the Future of Terrorism", Brynjar Lia notes that "Doomsday cults are nothing new," but also states that they are "relatively few". Lia cites the mass murder/suicide of members of Peoples Temple at Jonestown, Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, the use of salmonella as a poison by followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, and actions of Aum Shinrikyo as examples, noting that: "...during the past decades one has witnessed a number of increasingly violent doomsday sects, inflicting mass violence on their members and, in rare cases, also on outsiders".

Abdominal migraine

Abdominal migraine (AM) is a kind of migraine which causes severe pain in the area of the abdomen. The pain is usually around the navel (belly button) area, which is called the "periumbilical area".
AM is most common in children starting at about age 7, but younger and older children may also get AM. Usually, abdominal migraines stop by the time children become teenagers. However, children who have had AM are more likely to have migraine headaches when they are adults. Sometimes adults also have abdominal migraines.
Abdominal migraine causes "paroxysmal attacks" - attacks that happen suddenly, and happen again and again. The attacks can last from 1–72 hours, but they usually last less than 6 hours. They happen about one-third more often in females than in males.
Abdominal migraines can cause other symptoms along with bad pain in the abdomen. People with AM usually have at least two of these other symptoms: nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite (not wanting to eat), headache, photophobia (being bothered by lights), and pallor (pale skin).
AM is more common in children of women who have had migraine headaches. This suggests that AM may have a genetic cause (a cause that is passed down from parents to their children).
Abdominal migraines can cause many different symptoms. A person having an AM may have all of these symptoms, or only a few.
To diagnose abdominal migraine, first a doctor takes a patient's clinical history (where the doctor gathers information about all of the medical problems and medical treatments the patient has ever had). The doctor also takes a family history (gathering information about family members' health), because many medical problems may be "inheritable medical conditions". This means that the problems may be passed down from parents to children, possibly because of problems in the family's genes. Most people with abdominal migraines have family members (especially mothers) who have also had migraines.
Before making a final diagnosis of abdominal migraine, a doctor must rule out "differential diagnoses". These are other medical problems which could cause the same symptoms as AM. The doctor must make sure that the patient doesn't actually have one of these other problems instead of AM:

In the past, people practiced this martial art in many countries. Shotokan is still popular in modern culture. Karate is primarily a combat sport done with bare hands. That is the meaning of "Kara-te": "empty hand". So then the only weapons that can be used against a fighter are parts of the body. 
There are many styles of karate in different parts of the world. Shotokan is a style of karate that comes mainly from a small island south of Japan named Okinawa Island. The person who began this martial art was Gichin Funakoshi. This master practised karate all his life. He taught for many years and he wrote a book about his art.
In 1939, Funakoshi established the first "Shotokan" "dojo".
To exercise you must wear a karate uniform and a belt that tells what your level of experience is.
The order of karate belts is as follows for beginner to advanced levels: white, yellow, orange, green, blue, purple, brown and black. (The order of the belts may vary depending on the style of karate). After the black belt, there are nine more levels before finishing all notions of karate. 
In a fight, you must wear shin guards, gloves, a chest protector and a mouth piece. 
Karate is beneficial to maintain good physical and mental shape. First, this discipline allows us to maintain good muscle tone. This is good for succeed as the strikes in karate take strength.
Flexibility is also developed as karate requires that one performs high kicks and jumps. In addition, better endurance is necessarily because in the fight, fighters always need a good breath.
For mental well-being, karate promotes greater self-esteem, because it is an individual sport. The students progress at their own pace and one learns to overcome. In fact, it is a physical activity, so it helps to release stress and feel less pressure. In addition, Karate improves concentration because the fighter must be more attentive to his mind and his body. Having good concentration is an advantage. When someone is hurting during a fight, with his concentration he can no longer feel pain. Also, the fighter has to watch the eyes of his opponent and thinki about what he can do to catch him off guard.

Anal stricture

Anal stricture (also called "anal stenosis") is a medical problem that is not common; it may be "congenital" (a baby is born with a medical problem), but usually if it does happen it is after "anorectal surgery", which is surgery in the area of the rectum and anus. This may cause "stricture" (when a passage in the body becomes too narrow) of the anal canal, which leads to hard or painful bowel movements. When anal stenosis does occur it is usually after a "hemorrhoidectomy," which is the surgical removal of hemorrhoids; this is the cause in 90% of cases of anal stenosis.
Mild stenosis can be treated with stool softeners or fiber (which come from plant foods) supplements (in pill or powder form). When the narrowing of the anal canal is not too much, an operation called a "sphincterotomy" can be done to correct the problem. This is an operation done on the internal anal sphincter muscle, a round muscle inside the anal canal. In cases where the anal canal becomes very narrow, an operation called an "anoplasty" is done. This is "reconstructive surgery" (also known as "plastic surgery") of the anus.

As well as this, nobody can take the risk of backing down. The term is often used to describe a confrontation between two equals, where neither side will gain a winning advantage by being the first to shoot, but neither side can risk backing down. The Cold War between the USA and the Soviet Union is often described as being a Mexican standoff, with neither country prepared to be the first to risk using nuclear weapons.
The idea of a Mexican standoff is often used as part of the plot in movies.

Louis Cavagnari

Sir Pierre Louis Napoleon Cavagnari, KCB CSI (1841–1879), was a British military administrator in British India. He was the son of Count Louis Adolphus Cavagnari, from Parma, Italy, 
He later obtained naturalization as a British citizen, and entered the military service of the East India Company.In 1861 he was appointed an assistant commissioner in the Punjab region of British India, and in 1877 became deputy commissioner of Peshawar (now in Pakistan) and took part in several expeditions against the Pathan tribes.
In September 1878 he was attached to the staff of a British mission to Kabul, Afghanistan, which the Afghans refused to accept on their soil. In May 1879, after the British-Indian forces had invaded Afghanistan, and the death of Afghan Emir Sher, Cavagnari negotiated and signed the Treaty of Gandamak with Sher Ali's son and successor, Yaqub Khan. With this treaty, the Afghans agreed to admit a British representative to Kabul. The post was conferred on Cavagnari. He took up his residence in July 1879. However, on 3 September 1879, Cavagnari and the other European members of the mission, along with their guards who were made up of soldiers of the Corps of Guides, were killed after Afghan troops mutinied against them.

The class or tribal composition of the men recruited for 'The Guides' was mostly of Pathans of the region. The headquarters of the Guides was at Mardan (now in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan). 
After 1947 and the independence of Pakistan, the Guides regiment became part of the Pakistan Army. Its infantry section was incorporated into the Frontier Force Regiment while its cavalry side became the Guides Cavalry.

Foie gras is defined as the liver of a duck fattened by gavage (force-feeding corn), although outside of France it is occasionally produced using natural feeding.
Foie gras is a popular and well-known delicacy in French cuisine. Its flavor is described as rich, buttery, and delicate, unlike that of an ordinary duck or goose liver. Foie gras is sold whole, or is prepared into mousse, parfait or pâté (the lowest quality), and may also be served as an accompaniment to another food item, such as steak.

Staphylococcal infection

A staphylococcal infection (also called staph infection) is an infection caused by a "Staphylococcus" bacterium. Staphylococcus can cause many different infections. It can also cause food poisoning.
"Staphylococcus aureus" is a staphylococcus bacterium that can cause dangerous or even fatal diseases. Because "Staphylococcus aureus" can live on dry surfaces, such as doorknobs or tables, for longer than most bacteria, someone can get sick from "Staphylococcus aureus" from touching one of those surfaces if someone with a staphylococcal infection has touched it even if there is nobody who has a staphylococcal infection near them. "Staphylococcus aureus" can also cause toxic shock syndrome by releasing toxins into the bloodstream.
Methicillin-resistant "Staphylococcus aureus" is "Staphylococcus aureus" that is not cured by the antibiotic Methicillin or any other penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotics. This is called antibiotic resistance. Because penicillin and cephalosporin are the most important drugs that doctors use to treat "Staphylococcus aureus" infections, doctors may not be able to cure people with MRSA.
Other "Staphylococcus" bacteria can cause infections, including "Staphylococcus epidermidis" and "Staphylococcus saprophyticus". "Staphylococcus epidermidis" is a bacterium that is normally on the skin. If someone has a disease that makes his or her immune system work badly, this bacterium might give him or her an infection. "Staphylococcus saprophyticus" can cause urinary tract infections in women.

Sidney Altman (born May 7, 1939) is a Canadian-American molecular biologist. He is currently Professor of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology and Chemistry at Yale University. In 1989 he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Thomas Cech for their work on the catalytic properties of RNA.
Altman's Nobel Prize work came with the analysis of the catalytic properties of the ribozyme RNase P. RNase P is a ribonucleoprotein particle, part RNA and part protein. Originally it was thought that, in the bacterial RNase P complex, the protein subunit was responsible for the catalytic activity of the complex.
During experiments in which the complex was taken apart and put together in test tubes, Altman and his group discovered a remarkable thing. The RNA component, in isolation, was enough for the observed catalytic activity of the enzyme. This was remarkable because, previously, it was thought that only enzymes could catalyse reactions in living cells. Altman's research showed that RNA itself had catalytic properties. This was the discovery that earned him the Nobel prize.
Although the RNase P complex also exists in eukaryotic organisms, Altman's later work showed that in eukaryotes the protein subunits are essential to the catalytic activity, in contrast to the bacterial RNase P.

Supermarine Spitfire

The Supermarine Spitfire is a British single-seat fighter aircraft. It was used by the Royal Air Force and many other Allied countries throughout the Second World War. The Spitfire was designed by R. J. Mitchell as a short-range, high-performance interceptor aircraft. There were more Spitfires made than any other British aircraft and it was the only British fighter that was being made throughout the war.
The Spitfire's elliptical wing had a thin cross-section. This allowed a higher top speed than other fighters of the time, including the Hawker Hurricane. The elliptic shaped wing gives the aircraft a very low amount of induced drag. Speed was seen as essential to carry out the mission of home defence against enemy bombers. The original airframe was designed to be powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine producing 1,030 hp (768 kW).
Because of its higher performance, Spitfire units had a higher victory-to-loss ratio than units flying Hurricanes.

Linear A

Linear A is an ancient script used on Crete. No one has been able to translate this script yet. It was one of the writing systems used in Minoan Crete. Another script, about a century older, is called Cretan hieroglyphs. For some time, both methods of writing were used. Probably, each system was used for a special purpose.
Linear A was used from about the 17th century BC until the 15th century BC. Linear B is a script based on Linear A. It has been translated. Archaeologist Arthur Evans found both Linear A and B.
Linear A has about fifty signs that are similar to those in Linear B. About 80% of the signs in Linear A are unique. Using the knowledge from Linear B to read Linear A produces text which cannot be read. The language used has been called "Eteocretan". It does not seem to be related to any known language. Today, about 70 characters (probably representing syllables) are known. The meaning of about 100 ideographic characters is known. These are combined with the syllables. Also, there are a few numerals whose value is known.
Most texts seem to be lists. A few are probably short dedications, as they are found on libations. So far, no long texts have been found. Straight lines, such as those used for Linear A, are not very practical to use on clay tables. For this reasons, most writing was probably done on other things, such as papyrus or parchment. The problem with these materials is that they do not last as long as clay does. For this reason, most writing on papyrus and parchment has probably been lost.

Thetford Hoard

The Thetford Hoard, or Thetford Treasure, is a hoard of Romano-British metalwork found at Gallows Hill, near Thetford in Norfolk, in November 1979. It is now in the British Museum. 
Dating from the mid- to late-4th century AD, this hoard is a collection of thirty-three silver spoons and three silver strainers, twenty-two gold finger rings, four gold bracelets, four necklace pendants, five gold chain necklaces and two pairs of necklace-clasps, a gold amulet designed as a pendant, an unmounted engraved gem, four beads (one emerald and three of glass), and a gold belt-buckle decorated with a dancing satyr. A small cylindrical lidded box made from shale also belonged to the hoard.
The find was made under unfortunate circumstances. The site had been recently cleared for building work, and the finder was using a metal-detector without the knowledge and permission of the owners of the site. The discovery was made late on a November day, in failing light. The finder recovered the material in great haste, probably overlooking some small items, because he knew he had no legal right to search in that area. He did not, as the law requires, report his discovery to the authorities. Instead, he unwisely attempted to sell the objects he had found to private buyers. 
By the time archaeologists learned of the find several months later, the place had been built over, which made proper archaeological investigation impossible. It was not even possible to question the finder about the circumstances: by the time the material arrived at the British Museum for study, he was terminally ill, and he died about a month later, in July 1980. 
There were persistent rumours that the treasure originally included coins, and probably the group as we see it now is incomplete. The full account of the circumstances of the discovery is told in the standard catalogue.

Linear B

Linear B is an ancient script, used to write Mycenaean Greek, the oldest known form of Ancient Greek. This was proved by Michael Ventris in the early 1950s. Linear B came before the Greek alphabet by several centuries.
The script is based on Linear A, a script which cannot be read today. The oldest texts written in Linear B date from about 1450 BC. Linear B was found mainly in the palace archives at Knossos, Cydonia, Pylos, Thebes and Mycenae. It disappeared with the fall of the Mycenaean civilization.
There are about 87 signs in Linear B that represent syllables. In addition, there are many ideographic signs: These represent objects or commodities. They do not represent sounds, and are never used as word signs in writing a sentence.
Linear B seems to have only been used for administration. In all the thousands of clay tablets, a relatively small number of different "hands" (or writers) have been detected: 45 in Pylos (west coast of the Peloponnese, in southern Greece) and 66 in Knossos (Crete). The script may have only been used by a guild of professional scribes. These scribes worked at the different palaces: when the palaces were destroyed, the script disappeared.

Cretan hieroglyphs

Cretan hiroglyphs is a writing system, used in Crete from about the 20th to the 15th century BC. It is undeciphered, so it cannot be read today. For most of its history, it was used together with Linear A. Most symbols are pictograms, for some symbols, experts do not agree on what they represent. Most of the corpus consists of short inscriptions on seal stones, and clay tablets. The texts are usually very short, they are inscriptions on seals, and markers on clay tablets. There are three items that are noticeably different: A stone called Malia altar stone, the Phaistos Disc and the Arkalochori Axe. The exact relation of these items to the rest of the corpus is unknown. 
In total, there are 137 symbols. 96 seem to be words, or part of words. 32 are probably Logograms. 9 seem to represent fractions. There are four numerals, standing for 1, 10, 100 and 1000. One symbol is used to separate words, like a hyphen, another looks like a cross, and probably stands for the beginning of the text. The writing is probably syllabic.

Clay tablet

Clay tablets were a medium used for writing. They were common in the Fertile Crescent, from about the 5th millennium BC. A clay tablet is a more or less flat surface made of clay. Using a stylus, symbols were pressed into the soft clay. It is possible to correct errors on the tablet. The tablet was then baked or left in the sun until dry and hard.
Cuneiform was the first writing used on clay tablets. The system was used by several civilisaations who spoke several different languages.

Lewis chessmen

The Lewis Chessmen, or Uig Chessmen, are 78 12th-century chess pieces, most of which are carved in walrus ivory. The hoard was discovered in 1831 on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. They may be some of the few complete, surviving medieval chess sets. They are owned and exhibited by the British Museum in London, which has 67 of the original pieces, and the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, which has the remaining 11 pieces.
The pieces are figurative, like modern sets, and unlike the abstract Arabic pieces. The set has made the transition to European figures, which lasts to the present day. In particular, the arrival of a female figure is a departure from the Indo-Arabic game, and the figure of a bishop is also significant.
The chessmen were probably made in Norway, perhaps by craftsmen in Trondheim, in the 12th century, although some scholars have suggested other sources in the Nordic countries.
During that period the Outer Hebrides, and many other Scottish islands, were ruled by Norway. 
There is a broken queen piece in a similar style from an excavation of the archbishop's palace, similar carving in Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, the excavation in Trondheim of a kite-shaped shield similar to shields on some of the pieces and a king piece of similar design found on Hitra Island, near the mouth of Trondheim Fjord. Woolf has said that the armour worn by the chess figures includes "perfect" reproductions of armour worn at the time in Norway.
Another suggestion is that the chessmen originated in Iceland. It is not possible to decide between Norway and Iceland on the evidence available, and the date of the set is also somewhat uncertain. 
Some historians believe that the Lewis chessmen were hidden (or lost) after some mishap occurred during their carriage from Norway to rich Norse towns on the east coast of Ireland, like Dublin. The large number of pieces and their lack of wear may suggest they were the stock of a trader or dealer in such pieces. Along with the chess pieces, there were 14 plain round tablemen for the game of tables and one belt buckle, all made of ivory, making a total of 93 artifacts.
After their discovery by Malcolm Macleod in 1831 they were sold on, and shown at a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. The chessmen were soon after split up, with 10 being purchased by a Kirkpatrick Sharpe and the rest (67 chessmen and 14 tablemen) were purchased on behalf of the British Museum in London.
Kirkpatrick Sharpe later found another bishop to take his collection up to eleven, all of which were later sold . Eventually they were bought by the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, who donated them to the Royal Museum in Edinburgh. The eleven are now on display in the Museum of Scotland.
The pieces given to the British Museum still exist, and most can be found in Room 42 with the registration numbers M&ME 1831, 11–1.78–159. Some have been lent to Scottish museums and temporary exhibitions. A range of resin replicas are popular items in the Museum shops. 
The chessmen were number 5 in the list of British archaeological finds selected by experts at the British Museum for the 2003 BBC Television documentary "Our Top Ten Treasures". They feature in the 2010 BBC Radio 4 series "A History of the World in 100 Objects" as number 61, in the "Status Symbols" section.
An exhibition entitled "The Lewis Chessmen: Unmasked" that included chesspieces from both the Museum of Scotland and the British Museum collections, along with other relevant objects, toured Scotland in 2010/11.
An exhibition entitled "The Game of Kings: medieval ivory chessmen from the Isle of Lewis" at The Cloisters in New York City included 34 of the chess pieces, all on loan from the British Museum. The exhibit ended April 22, 2012.

Hypostatic model of personality

The hypostatic model of personality is a way of viewing the many sides of a person's character. The model says that a person can behave and appear to others in many ways, depending on how that person is, but also on how someone looks at that person. It says that people are not one-sided, but are a little bit of everything. For example, today someone can be mean, and tomorrow he can be good. How someone appears also depends on things and people around him or her. For example, sometimes the most coward person may become the greatest hero, if he is called to save someone's life. All these "sides" of a person have to be known by scientists so they can change them for the better.

The show ran for other versions. Some versions offered $25,000 as the prize. Others offered $100,000 as the prize.
In 2012, GSN premiered a new version called "The Pyramid". The show is based on the format of the old ones. This version premiered on September 3, 2012. It is hosted by Mike Richards. In this version, getting all 7 words right won the contestant $500, and the amount they would play for in the Winner's Circle went up by $5,000.
There are two halves of the game. The first and second halves are almost equal. In the first half, normal people team with famous people. One of the team will try to describe a word to the other. There are seven words in each round. There are six total rounds in the first half. At the end of the half the team with the most points moves on. They go to the "Winner's Circle". In the Winner's Circle, one player will use short phrases to tell the other a category. There are six categories for the Winner's Circle. If the team guesses all six correct in one minute they win the prize money. For the second half the players switch famous people. The gameplay is the same in the second half.
There have been many bonuses offered on the show. Some of the bonus cards are:

John Burgoyne

John Burgoyne (24 February 1722 – 4 August 1792) was a general in the British Army. In 1777, he led the British troops in the Battle Of Saratoga where he surrendered to American general Horatio Gates. This success led to France and Spain recognizing the United States and offering aid to the continental army. Historians consider this to be the turning point for the American Revolutionary War.

<doc id="370764" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=370764" title="Hoplite">
Hoplite

A hoplite was a citizen-soldier of the Ancient Greek city-states. A hoplite's main weapon was his spear. They fought close together in what was called a phalanx formation. In a phalanx, each man's shield protected himself and also gave some protection to the right arm of the man on his left. 
The word ""hoplite" comes from the type of the shield used by the soldiers. In later texts, the term "hoplite" is used to denote any armoured infantry, regardless of armament or ethnicity.
The armour of a hoplite included:
A hoplite was usually a free citizen who got his own armour and weapons. In most Greek city-states, citizens got basic military training, serving in the standing army for a time. They were expected to take part in any military campaign when they would be called for duty. The Lacedaemonian citizens (Sparta) were renowned for their lifelong combat training and almost mythical military prowess, while their greatest adversaries, the Athenians, were exempted from service only after the 60th year of their lives.
The phalanx, and hence the armour, was trained to work as a team. A phalanx tended to be 8 rows or more deep, each row with a leader, and an officer who kept order in the rear. The first lines would stab at their opponents, at the same time try to keep in position. The ranks behind them would support them with their spears and the mass of their shields gently pushing them, not to force them into the enemy but to keep them steady and in place. At certain points, a command would be given to take a certain number of steps forward. 
In battle, a phalanx would tend to drift to the right (as hoplites sought to keep behind the shield of their neighbour). The weak spot on a phalanx was on the right, where the free arms were unprotected by shields. The most experienced hoplites were often placed on the right side of the phalanx, to counteract these problems.

<doc id="370773" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=370773" title="Phalanx formation">
Phalanx formation

The phalanx formation is an Ancient Greek term for a block-like infantry formation. The Greek hoplites (heavy infantry) were armed with spears, swords, or similar weapons. The mass of infantry marched forward as one entity against opponents. The system was used by city states, who often fought each other. Cavalry were rare, partly because horses were a scarce resource, and partly because the lack of space on valley floors in the Peloponnese left little room for cavalry manoeuvres. Later, the Macedonian phalanx was always supported by cavalry in the conquests of Alexander the Great.
Early battles with the phalanx usually resulted in similar formations pushing against each other until one broke. The potential of the phalanx to do more was shown at the Battle of Marathon (490 BC). Facing the huge army of Darius I, the Athenians thinned out their phalanx and lengthened their front to avoid being outflanked. However, even a reduced-depth phalanx proved unstoppable to the lightly armed Persian infantry. After routing the Persian wings, the hoplites on the Athenian wings wheeled inwards, destroying the elite troop at the Persian centre. This was a crushing victory for Athens. Throughout the Greco-Persian Wars the hoplite phalanx continued to defeat the Persian infantry (e.g. the battles of Thermopylae and Plataea).
Perhaps the best example of the phalanx's flexibility was the oblique advance made in the Battle of Leuctra. There, the Theban general Epaminondas thinned out the right flank and centre of his phalanx, and deepened his left flank to an unheard-of 50 men deep. This reversed the convention by which the right flank of the phalanx was strongest. The new arrangement allowed the Thebans to assault in strength the elite Spartan troops on the right flank of the opposing phalanx. Meanwhile, the centre and right flank of the Theban line were echeloned back, from the opposing phalanx, keeping the weakened parts of the formation from being engaged. Once the Spartan right had been routed by the Theban left, the remainder of the Spartan line also broke. Thus by heading with the powerful wing, Epaminondas was able to defeat an enemy previously thought invincible.
Philip II of Macedon spent several years in Thebes as a hostage, and paid attention to Epaminondas' innovations. When he got home he raised a revolutionary new infantry force, which was to change the face of the Greek world. Phillip's phalangites were the first force of professional soldiers in Ancient Greece (apart from Sparta). They were armed with much longer spears and were drilled more thoroughly in more complex tactics and manoeuvres. More importantly, though, Phillip's phalanx was part of a multi-faceted, combined force that included a variety of skirmishers and cavalry, most notably his famous Companion cavalry. 
The Macedonian phalanx now was used to pin the centre of the enemy line, while cavalry and more mobile infantry struck at the foe's flanks. Its supremacy over the more static armies fielded by the Greek city-states was shown at the Battle of Chaeronea, where Philip II's army crushed the allied Theban and Athenian phalanxes.

He scored the very first goal in Maple Leaf Gardens on November 12, 1931 and also dropped the very same puck that he used to score the first goal during the ceremonial opening faceoff as part of the final game played at the Gardens. March was the last surviving member of Black Hawks 1934 Stanley Cup team.

The Oh-My-God particle was a really tiny portion of matter or energy (undefined) moving incredibly fast. It was first spotted on the evening of 15 October 1991 over Dugway Proving Ground in Utah and shocked many astrophysicists. It has an estimated energy of (50 J)—in other words, a subatomic particle with kinetic energy equal to that of a baseball () traveling at about . That amount of energy is also 50 times the energy that a collision in the Large Hadron Collider would have.
The speed of the particle was almost the speed of light. If a year were to pass in a race between a ray of light and the particle the distance will be 0.00000046 millimetre or be behind 0.00000000000000015 seconds.

Krishnamurti

Krishnamurti Jiddu (11 May 1895 – 17 February 1986) was an Indian-born speaker on philosophical and spiritual subjects. His career had two clearly distinct stages. In the first, he was the pupil and eventually leader of the new religious movement known as Theosophy. In the second part he rejected Theosophy and every belief associated with it, saying: "I maintain that truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any religion, by any sect".
Krishnamurti was born into a Brahmin family in what was then British India. In early adolescence, he had a chance encounter with prominent occultist and high-ranking theosophist Charles Webster Leadbeater in the grounds of the Theosophical Society headquarters at Adyar in Madras (now Chennai). He was subsequently raised by Annie Besant and Leadbeater, leaders of the Society at the time. They believed him to be a "vehicle" for an expected World Teacher. While he was young, Besant had control over his life, and won a court case for custody of Krishnamurti and his brother.
As a young man, Krishnamurti disavowed Theosophy and dissolved the worldwide organization (the Order of the Star in the East) established to support it. He resigned from the various trusts and other organizations which were affiliated with Order of the Star, and the Theosophical Society. He returned the monies and properties donated to the Order, among them a castle in the Netherlands and of land, to their donors. 
From then on he claimed allegiance to no nationality, caste, religion, or philosophy. He spent the rest of his life travelling the world, speaking to large and small groups and individuals. He authored many books, among them "The First and Last Freedom", "The Only Revolution", and "Krishnamurti's Notebook". Many of his talks and discussions have been published. 
Krishnamurti did not accept followers nor worshippers. He thought the relationship between disciple and guru encouraged dependency and exploitation. He accepted gifts and financial support freely offered to him by people inspired by his work, and continued with lecture tours and the publication of books and talk transcripts for more than half a century. 
He constantly urged people to think independently, and he invited them to explore and discuss specific topics together with him. His subject matter included: psychological revolution, the nature of mind, meditation, inquiry, human relationships, and bringing about change in society. He stressed the need for a revolution in the psyche of every human being and emphasized that such revolution cannot be brought about by any external entity, be it religious, political, or social.
His supporters, working through non-profit foundations in India, Great Britain and the United States, oversee several independent schools based on his views on education. They continue to transcribe and distribute his thousands of talks, group and individual discussions, and writings by use of a variety of media formats and languages.

XYZ Affair

France was taking American ships in 1797. President John Adams wanted to avoid a war with France, so he sent officials to France to discuss the rights of neutral nations. However, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, the French foreign minister, sent three secret agents who insisted that America give a loan to France and pay a bribe. President Adams would not do what France wanted. When he told the public in 1798, he addressed the Frenchmen as X, Y, and Z, hence the name of this affair. People hated the XYZ Affair, saying, “Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute!” America soon quickly declined France’s offer. John Adams decided to start preparing for war, but not declaring war so as to keep peace.

The Phaistos disc is a bronze age artifact. The disc is about in diameter and is made of clay. It is covered with many symbols. It is from the civilization of Minoa on the Greek island of Crete, possibly from the 2nd millennium BC. 
The symbols cover both sides of the disc. They show everyday things. They were stamped onto the disc, pressed into the clay when it was still soft. They run in a spiral. This disc is the first known "printed" work in history; in the sense that there was a re-usable set of characters and drawings. It is the only artefact of its kind. Many questions have been asked about the disc, about its purpose, and if the signs shown actually represent writing.
In total, there are 242 tokens on the disc, taken from a set of 45 unique signs. There are arranged in 61 groups, separated by lines. Groups are between two and seven stamps long. Because the "text" is very short, and the disc is unique, it is likely that it will not be deciphered.

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was a bill in the United States. It was signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. It is also known as Obamacare.
There are many parts to the health care law.
There is now no limit on how long a person can get health care from a company. If an insurance company wants to make people pay more for their coverage, they have to give an explanation of their decision to the public. The amount that a person pays for health care, called an insurance premium, must now be used by the insurance companies only for health care. This money cannot be used for other things, like paying workers.
Health care that goes to preventing sickness is now free for many people. This is called preventive care. Health care plans now give people more choices for doctors. People can also get emergency health care at hospitals that are not covered by their health insurance.
Because of this law, children can use the health insurance of their parents until they are 26 years old. Children under 19 years old have to be given good health insurance by insurance companies, even if they are very sick before they purchase health insurance. This means that health insurance companies cannot limit coverage to only healthy children.
People who do not have health insurance will have to pay a tax until they get health insurance. This part of the act is called the individual mandate. The Supreme Court of the United States decided that the government has a right to give this tax under the United States Constitution. The amount that people will have to pay if they do not have health insurance will increase every year until 2016. Some people without health insurance will not have to pay this tax, such as poor people who cannot get insurance for free.
In 2015, companies that have more than 50 full-time workers will be responsible for giving these workers health insurance. Companies who have fewer than 50 workers will not have to do this. A full-time worker is a person who works for more than 30 hours a week at one job.
If you do not have health insurance, then you can purchase insurance on the Health Insurance Marketplace. You can also purchase insurance on the marketplace if the company that you work for gives you insurance and you are not happy with it. People can use the Health Insurance Marketplace to buy insurance on the website Healthcare.gov. If people want health insurance by January 1st, 2014, they have to register for the insurance on this market by December 15th, 2013. If they register after December 15th and they do not get health insurance by January 1st, then they will probably have to pay the tax from the individual mandate. There are ways to contact someone who works for the government if you have problems registering for health insurance on this market.
Each health insurance on this market has to pay for a person’s prescription medicine, emergency health care, maternity care, mental health care, rehabilitation, and many other things. Maternity care is given to pregnant women to take care of their children.
Medicaid is health insurance given to poor people that is paid by the states and the federal government. Medicaid will be expanded so that more people can use it. States can choose if they want to expand Medicaid. If they choose to do this, then the federal government will pay for the majority of the cost of Medicaid.
People were worried that companies would not hire new workers or would make people work for less than 30 hours in one week so that they would not have to pay for health insurance. There have been some stories of companies doing this, but there are no statistics to support it.
There are 27 states that are not happy with the Medicaid expansion. The Supreme Court of the United States decided that these states do not have to expand Medicaid, even if the federal government wants them to.
In October 2013, the government stopped working for 16 days because Republicans and Democrats could not agree on how to pay for the Affordable Care Act. They led to the shutdown of the government. Over 800,000 people who work for the government were not paid during this time and the government had to pay them back after the shutdown ended.
In August of 2009, Sarah Palin, a person who used to be a candidate for vice president, said to the news that the Affordable Care Act would create death panels. She said that these death panels would be a group of people who would decide whether or not an older person was to receive health care or whether they should die. Many news companies and people who do research have shown that what she said is not true.

Zam Zama

Zam Zama or Zam-zammah also often called the 'terror of Northern India' is an old cannon. It is made of brass and was made in Lahore (now in Pakistan) in 1762, on the orders of the Afghan king. Ahmad Shah Durrani. It was of great size back then, and had tremendous fire-power, and all armies opposing the Afghans were terrified of it in the region. 
The cannon was later damaged in a military campaign and sank to the bottom of the Chenab River from where it was recovered and captured by the victorious Sikh "Khalsa" forces of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. After that, the Punjab region fell under Sikh rule, giving birth to the superstition that 'whoever holds Zam Zama holds the Punjab'.
The cannon was later taken to Delhi but brought back to Lahore in 1870 and installed outside the old Lahore Museum and then later on shifted outside the present museum building in the 1890s, opposite to the old campus of the University of the Punjab. It was later restored and cleaned up in the 1990s.
During the period of British India, Zam Zama achieved special fame when the writer Rudyard Kipling mentioned in the opening pages of "Kim (book)", published in 1901.

Lahore Museum

The Lahore Museum or Ajaib Ghar (Urdu: Wonder House) is a museum in the city of Lahore, Pakistan. It is the largest and best museum in the country.
The original old Lahore Museum was made during British Indian times in the 1860s, in what had been the old 'Punjab Exhibition Hall' and the famous gun Zam Zama was installed outside it in 1870. This old museum, along with the Punjab School of Arts (later the Mayo College of Arts) was looked after by John Lockwood Kipling (1837-1911) father of the writer Rudyard Kipling, who mentioned the museum and Zam Zama in his "Kim (book)" (1901). In 1894, the museum's 'new' building was completed and it shifted there the same year, right opposite the old campus of the University of the Punjab, on the Mall.
At present, the Lahore Museum is set in its beautiful grounds and has one of the best collections of arts and artifacts in its galleries in South Asia. Especially notable are: (a) its ancient Gandhara Buddhist sculptures (b) its Tibetan and Hill States collection (c) its famed collection of miniature paintings from the Mughal Empire and the "Pahari" school and (d) its excellent collection of contemporary paintings by some of Pakistan's most prominent artists such as Ustad Allah Bux, A.R. Chughtai, Shakir Ali, Sadequain, Gulgee and others.

Don't Break the Oath

Don't Break the Oath is the second studio album by Mercyful Fate, a heavy metal band from Denmark. Some people who make music and people who talk about music think it is one of the best heavy metal albums ever.
In the 1980s, there were a lot of bands in Europe playing heavy metal. Many of them were playing music like bands from the United Kingdom, in a way that was called the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (or NWOBHM for short). There were a lot of hard rock bands, too, and there were a lot of things hard rock bands and NWOBHM bands both did. Mercyful Fate was one of the first few NWOBHM bands to be different from hard rock bands on purpose.
King Diamond, the singer and leader of Mercyful Fate, painted his face with upside-down crosses and wrote lyrics about Satan, Hell, and things like that. Hank Shermann, the band's guitarist, played very fast and with a lot of guitar solos to help make the band sound evil. Mercyful Fate had already started to do these things in 1983 with their last album, "Melissa".
Hank Shermann and Michael Denner wrote the songs in a way that fit well with King Diamond's singing. Like on "Melissa", King Diamond sang in a high-pitched way that was different from other heavy metal singers. 
All of the ideas in all of the songs are evil. They talk about things like bringing back people from the dead, casting black magic, and witches and demons. Worshipping Satan is a special subject, and is talked about on almost every song.
Not many people paid to say things about music talked about "Don't Break the Oath" in 1984. Sites like Amazon and Rate Your Music show that normal people who listen to music think the album is one of the best heavy metal albums ever.
"Don't Break the Oath" helped create extreme metal, a special kind of heavy metal that is built around ideas that are dark, evil, or hateful, and that is almost always played louder and in a way that hurts some people's ears. One kind of extreme metal took a lot of ideas from this album and other albums by bands like Venom, Hellhammer, and Celtic Frost, and came to be called black metal.

Henna, also known as mehandi or mendhi is a flowering plant. It has been used since ancient times to dye skin, hair, fingernails, leather, cotton, wool and other fabrics. The name is also used for the dye or color preparation derived from the plant, and for the art of making temporary tattoos or designs from these dyes. These henna tattoos are often used in wedding ceremonies. 
In addition, the name is also sometimes used, wrongly, for other chemical preparations and dyes that are in fact not made from this plant. 
The English name "henna" comes from the Arabic (or colloquially , loosely pronounced /ħinna/). The natural dye is still mostly used in Arabia, the Middle East, India, and Pakistan.

Dominican people (Dominican Republic)

Dominicans () are inhabitants or citizens of the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic is a multi-ethnic country in the Caribbean basin which is home to people of many different racial, ethnic, national and cultural backgrounds which has often become a great pride for many Dominicans.
It is estimated that some 894,000 enslaved Africans were brought to Dominican Republic between 1717 and 1870 (and more before 1717). The slaves came from various West African regions, but the majority came from primarily the Congo region (present-day Angola, Congo, Gabon, and Cameroon) and the gold coast/Guinean (present-day Ghana and Guinea).
In addition, many immigrants arrived from other places around the world. After the last smuggled slave ship that arrived in 1898, many Chinese people came to the island due to the Chinese Revolution, along with the Arabs of North Africa (Morocco or Algeria) and Indians. Immigration from Europe, most notably Spaniards, Italians and Germans occurred during the later parts of the nineteenth century into the beginning of the twentieth century, mostly settling in Santo Domingo and in rural areas in the Cibao valley alike. During World War II, the Dominican Republic became the only nation to take in Jewish refugees by orders from then president Rafael Leonidas Trujillo. Nearly 800 German and Austrian Jews settled in the town of Sosua, Puerto Plata.
Today, much of the contemporary Dominican population is largely Mulatto. The Dominican Republic itself is 73% Mulatto, 16% White and 11% Black. Studies have indicated that up to 15% of all Dominicans carry maternal Taino-Arawak lineage, figures which are higher in rural areas. Other studies often indicate that the average Dominican is 53% European (mostly Spanish), 39% Sub-Saharan African and 8% Taino-Arawak, but these figures also vary by region as the Black race is the predominant race in the southern and coastal regions of the country.

Ghost Dance

Ghost Dance was a new religious movement among Native Americans. It was active from about 1860 to about 1890. These people had been forced to change their ways of life, and had lost much of their culture and identity. The Ghost Dance promised them that if they performed the "Dance" and lived the right way, they could re-unite the living and the dead, they would again be given most of the things they had lost to the whites, and the people who had caused such misery would be driven away from their land. There were also real dance rituals that they did to represent their spiritual path.
There was a lot of activity twice: the first time around 1860, and the second time around 1890. Around 1860, a Native American (Paiute) called "Wodziwob" had a vision. He saw that the white people would be driven away, and the people would be reunited with their ancestors' spirits, called "ghosts". He was also told how to do the dance ritual. The movement spread rapidly. Each tribe added its own elements into the Ghost Dance. The first phase ended around 1872, because it did not have success, and Wodzivob said that he was possibly wrong.
The second wave started about twenty years later. A man called Wovoka who worked at an LDSMormon ranch started it. He was influenced by the new faith, and by some of its ideas, such as sending apostles to spread the faith. This movement spread wider, and was again adapted to each tribe's culture. The Lakota also adopted the idea of a messiah. The Lakota lived on a reservation, and the local authorities saw this as threat, when they saw 25,000 natives dance. This led to the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890, where many Natives were killed.
Wovoka wrote a letter in 1892 to the other tribes telling them that Jesus had just returned to earth that year, and that if they lived upright lives, they would be getting their lands and culture again some day, and the dead would live. He stayed out of public sight for the rest of his life after giving this message, and lived until the 1930s.

Also, some new track is too heavy to be lifted by hand, so a tamper has to be used.

Tent pegging

Tent pegging (sometimes spelled 'tentpegging' or 'tent-pegging') is a cavalry or equestrian sport of ancient origin.
In the specific sport of tent pegging a mounted horseman, or at times a team of horsemen, rides at a gallop and uses a sword or a lance to pierce, try to pick up, and carry away a small ground target (a symbolic tent peg) or a series of such small ground targets.
The origins of tent pegging are ambiguous and subject to some controversy. Some scholars and historians believe it originated in Arabia, others believe that it might have possibly evolved in Central Asia, while others still believe in its Indian origins. It is believed that people have practised the game of tent pegging since at least the 4th century BC, and over the ages Middle Eastern, Asian and later European empires popularized the game around the world.
The term "tent pegging", however, historically emerged from the attacks by Arabian Muslim cavaliers on their enemy camps at dawn or late night, where they would gallop to their tents and pluck out the pegs of their tents, so that these would collapse on them, thus causing havoc and terror in the camp. Several old medieval Arab books give descriptions of such tactics.
Today, tent pegging is practised around the world, but is especially popular in Australia, Pakistan, India, Israel, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Canada and the United Kingdom. The Olympic Council of Asia included tent pegging as an official sport in 1982, and the International Federation for Equestrian Sports recognised it as an official equestrian discipline in 2004.
However, it is important to recognize the difference between tent pegging as an 'international sport' and the local, rural and version of the sport played by the traditional tribal peoples such as the Bedu in the Middle East and Oman, the "Desi" horsemen of Pakistani and Indian Punjab and so on. The former is a milder sport, whereas the latter is a fiercer and more commanding contest.

Arkalochori Axe

The Arkalochori Axe is a bronze double axe, probably from the 17th century BC. The axe was found in a cave on Crete, in 1934. Other items were also found together with the axe. Possibly, there was an earthquake which rendered the cave inaccessible, at the end of the period SM I. The axe was probably used for a reliious ritual. The axe is inscribed with fifteen symbols. It has been suggested that these might be Linear A but Professor Glanville Price agrees with Louis Godart that "the characters on the axe are no more than a 'pseudo-inscription' engraved by an illiterate in uncomprehending imitation of authentic Linear A characters on other similar axes." The axe and the Phaistos Disc are conserved in the Iraklion Archaeological Museum.
The cave where the axe was found was used from about 2500 BC onwards. In 1912, 53 bronze swords, and 19 double axes were found there; one of the axes is made of silver. Such axes often appear on items which have been attributed to the Minoan or Mycenean culture. One example is the Hagia Triada sarcophagus, which has been dated to the 14th century BC.
When the cave was searched again in 1934, a bigger double axe, made of bronze was found. This axe is about 30 centimetres wide. It is special because it bears an inscription. The symbols on the axe are aligned in three columns. These characters have been compared to both Linear A and the stamps on the Phaistos disc. As of 2012, the writing is unreadable.
Together with this axe, hundreds of long swords, knives and double axes were found in the cave. Most of these were given as offerings, but some are usable. There are 25 small double axes made of gold and seven made of silver. Among the axes found, there are a golden axe, and one made of sivler; either axe is only about 5 cm wide. Both axes (ref "AR Zf 1" and "AR Zf 2") bear the same inscription of a word in Linear A:
This has been phonetically transcribed as "I-DA-MA-TE". This transcription resembles the name of the goddess Demeter. The four symbols in Linear A also resemble symbols on the bigger bronze axe. The findings indicate that there probably was a temple to a deity linked to military activity in the cave.
Of the fifteen signs, two appear to be unique. The suggestions for comparison with Linear A and Phaistos Disc glyphs are due to Torsten Timm (2004).
Reading right to left, top to bottom, the symbols are as follows.

The National College of Arts in Lahore, Pakistan is usually referred to by its acronym NCA. It is the oldest fine arts training institute in the country and one of the oldest and best in all of Asia. 
The NCA has a rich historical tradition dating back to the days of the British Raj. During the 1860s, it was established in Lahore, in the Punjab region, as the 'Punjab School of Arts' and was then renamed the 'Mayo School of Arts, Lahore', after Lord Mayo, a Viceroy of India. In the 1890s, it moved to its present location next to the Lahore Museum and became the 'Mayo College of Arts' and after Partition and Independence of Pakistan in 1947, it was formally designated as the 'National College of Arts'. 
The old Mayo School and College had the unique distinction of having as its first principal and head, Mr John Lockwood Kipling, father of the writer Rudyard Kipling, who was also Curator of the Lahore Museum simultaneously.

Josef Fritzl

Josef Fritzl (born 13 April 1935) is an Austrian criminal. He held his daughter captive in a basement dungeon that he built under his house. Fritzl made his daughter write letters to him and her mother, saying she had joined a cult. During the 24 years that he had her imprisoned, Fritzl raped his daughter often, and she had seven children by him. One of the baby boys died and Fritzl raped his body. The police eventually found out about his crimes when one of the children became very sick and he took her to the hospital. 
Fritzl was tried and convicted on several charges, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment in a facility for the mentally ill in March 2009. Fritzl could become eligible for release after fifteen years, but he is expected to be in prison until he dies. A forensic psychiatrist diagnosed him with a personality disorder and a sexual disorder.

<doc id="371188" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=371188" title="Superiority bias">
Superiority bias

Superiority bias is when people think too much of themselves without good reason. They overrate their positive qualities and abilities, and underrate their negative qualities (relative to others). Other phrases for this are: illusory superiority, the above average effect, leniency error, sense of relative superiority, the "primus inter pares" effect, and the Lake Wobegon effect. This was named after Garrison Keillor's fictional town where "all the children are above average". 
Illusory superiority has been found in education (such as class performance, exams and overall intelligence), at work (for example in job performance), and in social settings (for example in estimating one's popularity, or the extent to which one possesses desirable personality traits, such as honesty or confidence), as well as everyday abilities requiring particular skill.
One problem is the ambiguity of the word "average". It is logically possible for nearly all of the set to be above the mean if the distribution of abilities is highly skewed. For example, the mean number of human legs is slightly lower than two, because of a small number of people have only one or no legs. Hence experiments usually compare subjects to the median of the peer group, since by definition it is impossible for a majority to exceed the median.
A second problem is that people interpret a question in different ways, so maybe most are better than the rest of the group "each on their own understanding". This interpretation is confirmed by experiments which varied the amount of interpretive freedom subjects were given. As subjects evaluate themselves on a specific, well-defined attribute, illusory superiority remains.
In Kruger and Dunning's experiments participants were given specific tasks (such as solving problems in logic, analyzing grammar questions, and deciding whether or not jokes were funny). They were asked to evaluate their performance on these tasks relative to the rest of the group. This gave a direct comparison of their actual and perceived performance.
Results were divided into four groups depending on actual performance and it was found that all four groups evaluated their performance as above average, meaning that the lowest-scoring group (the bottom 25%) showed a very large illusory superiority bias. The researchers attributed this to the fact that the individuals who were worst at performing the tasks were also worst at recognizing skill in those tasks. This was supported by the fact that, given training, the worst subjects improved their estimate of their rank as well as getting better at the tasks.
In a survey of faculty at the University of Nebraska, 68% rated themselves in the top 25% for teaching ability. In a similar survey, 87% of MBA students at Stanford University rated their academic performance as above the median.
Findings of illusory superiority in research have also explained phenomena such as the large amount of stock market trading (as each trader thinks they are the best, and most likely to succeed), and the number of lawsuits that go to trial (because, due to illusory superiority, many lawyers have an inflated belief that they will win a case).
One of the first studies that found the effect of illusory superiority was carried out in 1976 by the College Board in the USA. A survey was attached to the SAT exams (taken by approximately one million students per year), asking the students to rate themselves relative to the median of the sample (rather than the average peer) on a number of vague positive characteristics. In ratings of leadership ability, 70% of the students put themselves above the median. In ability to get on well with others, 85% put themselves above the median, and 25% rated themselves in the top 1%.
Research also showed subjects rated friends higher than other peers. 
In Zuckerman and Jost's study, participants were given detailed questionnaires about their friendships and asked to assess their own popularity. They showed that the participants generally had exaggerated perceptions of their own popularity, particularly in comparison to their own friends.
Researchers have also found the effects of illusory superiority in studies into relationship satisfaction. For example, one study found that participants thought their own relationships were better than others' relationships on average. They also thought that most people were happy with their relationships. This study found evidence that the higher the participants rated their own relationship happiness, the more superior they believed their relationship was. 
In men, satisfaction was also related to the perception that one's own relationship was superior. Women's satisfaction was particularly related to the assumption that most others were happy with their relationship.
Illusory superiority effects have been found in a study of health behaviors. The study involved asking participants to estimate how often they, and their peers, carried out healthy and unhealthy behaviors. Participants reported that they carried out healthy behaviors more often than the average peer, and unhealthy behaviors less often, as would be expected given the effect of illusory superiority. These findings were for both past self-report of behaviors and expected future behaviors.
Svenson (1981) surveyed 161 students in Sweden and the United States, asking them to compare their driving safety and skill to the other people in the experiment. For driving skill, 93% of the US sample and 69% of the Swedish sample put themselves in the top 50% (above the median). For safety, 88% of the US group and 77% of the Swedish sample put themselves in the top 50%.
McCormick, Walkey and Green (1986) found similar results in their study, asking 178 participants to evaluate their position on eight different dimensions relating to driving skill (examples include the "dangerous-safe" dimension and the "considerate-inconsiderate" dimension). Only a small minority rated themselves as below average (the midpoint of the dimension scale) at any point, and when all eight dimensions were considered together it was found that almost 80% of participants had evaluated themselves as being above the average driver.
Subjects describe themselves in positive terms compared to other people, and this includes describing themselves as less susceptible to bias than other people. This effect is called the "bias blind spot".

Jimmy Donegan

Jimmy Donegan (born around 1940) is an Aboriginal Australian artist. His painting "Papa Tjukurpa munu Pukara" won the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2010. He speaks Pitjantjatjara and Ngaanyatjarra. His work is held in several major private galleries in Australia and Europe. The only major public gallery to hold one of his works is the National Gallery of Victoria.
Donegan was born about 1940. He was born at Yanpan, a rock hole near Ngatuntjarra bore in outback Western Australia. He grew up living a traditional, nomadic way of life in the Pitjantjatjara and Ngaanyatjarra country around what is now the communities of Papulankutja and Mantamaru. His family settled at Papulankutja (then known as Blackstone) in the 1950s.
Before he began painting, Donegan worked as a stockman. He was also a hunter and a craftsman well known for making traditional hunting tools (spears, spear-throwers and boomerangs). During the early 1970s, Donegan helped to set up outstations in the south-western Pitjantjatjara lands. His wife was born near Puta Puta, a place close to Kalka in what is now the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands. The couple and their children originally lived there, but they later moved to Papulankutja, closer to Jimmy's own homeland.
Jimmy's wife, Nuuniwa Imundura Donegan, was also a craftswoman. During the mid- to late-1990s, she was a member of the Tjanpi Desert Weavers, a project of women producing artistic objects made mainly from grass (""). Their life-sized "Tjanpi Grass Toyota", a truck made mostly of desert grasses, won the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2005. Other examples of her work are now held in the National Gallery of Victoria, the National Gallery of Australia, and the National Museum of Australia.
Donegan began painting professionally about 2000. He was one of the first painters at the local co-operative Papulankutja Artists, established in 2001. Some of his work with Papulankutja was displayed in a group exhibition in Perth in 2005. During this year, Nuuniwa died, and Donegan moved back to live at Kalka. The couple's four children were living there, and he returned to live with them. He started painting for Kalka's community art centre, Ninuku Arts, when it was established in 2006.
Since joining Ninuku Arts, Donegan's work has been featured every year in the annual Desert Mob exhibition in Alice Springs. It has also been shown in other group exhibitions in Sydney, Canberra, Broome, Melbourne and Adelaide. He has not had a solo exhibition.
Donegan's paintings depict ancestral stories from the Dreamtime, which have spiritual significance for his family. He mostly focuses on stories relating to his paternal (his father's and grandfather's) heritage. His father was Dulu, a rock hole in the Gibson Desert where there are lots of dingoes. It is associated with the Dingo Dreaming ('). His grandfather's country is Pukara, a sacred men's site south of Irrunytju that is closely associated with the story of the two snake men ('). These are stories are about how the land was created.
Donegan's most famous painting, "Papa Tjukurpa munu Pukara", combined both of these stories onto a single canvas. It is a composition of several different styles and techniques. The painting won the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award in August 2010. It was given the award for best painting, and was then chosen for the overall prize from the winners of each of the five categories. It was the first time Donegan had entered his artwork into a competition.
Critics have said that Donegan's work looks influenced by the early styles of the Western Desert art movement at Warburton – as the artist was living there during the mid-1990s –, but that he also shows a new style and experimentalism.

Lady Garden Park

The Lady Garden Park (originally Ladies' Garden) is a public park in Abbottabad town, Pakistan. 
The park was established soon after the foundation of Abbotabad town itself (January 1853) by Major James Abbott. As distinct from the "Company Bagh" (East India Company Park) which was also founded down in the main bazaar for the recreation of "natives", the Ladies Garden was exclusively for the use of European or "White" ladies and families. It was laid out over a whole block of the urban military cantonment area, opposite to St Luke's Church, Abbottabad. A number of trees and flowers imported from England and other places were also planted here.
While the British Raj in India lasted, this park retained its exclusive character, but after the Independence of Pakistan in 1947, it was opened to all the general public.
The park is a very popular recreational place for the citizens of Abbottabad. Apart from the general, open area with lawns and walks etc., a section has also been segregated for women and children, with swings, slides, see-saws and so on. A small snack-bar and benches are also placed in a pleasant location, under some fine old trees. A special feature of the park is the copy of the farewell poem written by Major Abbott, the town's founder, which has been carved on a big stone slab beneath a majestic cedar tree. Many tourists come to see and read this and get themselves photographed here (See Link Below for Abbott Poem Text).
The park has some literary connections, or has been mentioned in some literary works, most notably:

Commemorative plaque

A commemorative plaque, or simply plaque, is a plate made of metal, ceramic, stone, wood, or other material. It is usually placed on a wall or a large stone. It usually has text and sometimes an image in memory of one or more persons, an event, a former use of the place, or some other thing. A plaquette is a small plaque. The word plaquette is not usually used for outdoor plaques fixed to walls.
In England there is the Blue Plaques scheme. Plaques are put on to buildings to commemorate their links with important people or events. The scheme has been run by English Heritage for over 140 years and is thought to be the oldest of its kind in the world.
Other commemorative plaque schemes are run by local councils and charities throughout the United Kingdom. These use their own rules for deciding when to put up a plaque. A list of schemes in England can be found on the English Heritage website.
As the price of scrap metal has increased plaques have been stolen by thieves wishing to sell the metal for cash.
Plaques or, more often, plaquettes, are also given as awards instead of trophies or ribbons. Such plaques usually have text describing the reason for the award and, often, the date of the award.

Valonia ventricosa

Valonia ventricosa, also known as "bubble algae" and "sailors’ eyeballs", is a species of algae found in oceans throughout the world in tropical and subtropical regions. It is one of the largest single-celled organisms. However, although genuinely a single cell, it has more than one nucleus.
"Valonia ventricosa" usually grow alone, but sometimes they grow in groups. They appear in the littoral zones and continental shelf of tropical and subtropical areas, like the Caribbean, north to Florida, south to Brazil, and in the Indo-Pacific. Overall, they inhabit most oceans in the world, often living in broken coral.
The deepest water it lives in is about .
The single-cell organism has a spherical to ovoid (egg-like) shape. The colour varies from grass green to dark green (though in deep dark water they may appear to be silver, teal, or even blackish). This is determined by the number of chloroplasts of the specimen. The surface of the cell shines like glass. The body is a thin-walled, tough, single cell with more than one nucleus. The diameter is usually from although it may get to in rare cases. The "bubble" alga is attached to the bottom by fibres: "... anchored to a substrate by minute hair-like appendages called rhizoids that create a surprisingly strong hold". 
Reproduction occurs by cell division, where the multinucleic mother cell makes daughter cells, which become separate from the mother cell.
Because its cells are so large, "Valonia ventricosa" has been used to study the permeability of cell membranes.< In studying the cellulose lattice in the cell wall, "Valonia ventricosa" has undergone extensive X-ray analytical procedures. It has also been studied for its electrical properties, due to its unusually high electrical potential relative to the seawater that surrounds it.

Common ivy

Common Ivy ("Hedera helix") is a vine. It is evergreen - it does not lose its leaves in winter. Originally, the plant grew on the Macaronesian islands, but it spread through the Mediterranean and Europe to Asia. All parts of the plant are poisonous. It is often used as a decorative plant in gardens. Ivy is very important for ecology: its nectar and seeds are available when few other plants are. Sometimes ivy is considered to be an invasive species, esp. in North America.

Macaronesia

The Macaronesian islands, or simply Macaronesia is a modern name for several groups of islands of volcanic origin in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Europe and Africa. They belong to three countries: Portugal, Spain, and Cape Verde.
Macaronesia (Greek: "makáron" 'blessed', 'happy', "nêsoi" 'island'; 'blessed/fortunate islands'). This term was used by Ancient Greek geographers for islands to the west of the Strait of Gibraltar.
The modern use of the term Macaronesia goes to the botanist Philip Barker Webb in the 1830s for botanical descriptions. The name is occasionally misspelled "Macronesia" in analogy with Micronesia.
The following groups of islands (archipelagos) are commonly counted as being part of the Macaronesia - from north to south:
Spanish is spoken in the Canary Islands and Portuguese in the rest of the islands. Cape Verde was a colony of Portugal but it is independent since 1975.
The islands of Macaronesia are volcanic in origin, and are thought to be the product of several geologic hotspots.
The climate of the Macaronesian islands goes from Mediterranean in the Azores and Madeira to arid in Cape Verde. The Portuguese archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira have a generally cooler climate and higher rainfall than the Canary Islands and Cape Verde.
Even if the distances between the different groups of islands are large, the plants and animals are similar and there are many endemic plants that are found only in these islands.
The islands have a unique biogeography, and are home to several distinct plant and animal communities. The laurel forests, known as "laurisilva", of Macaronesia are a type of mountain cloud forest with species of a vegetation type which originally covered much of the Mediterranean Basin when the climate of the region was more humid and evolved to adapt to island conditions. These forests once covered most of the Azores, Madeira, and parts of the Canary Islands ("Canaries") between 400–1200 m altitude (the eastern Canaries and Cape Verde being too dry).
Cutting the trees for timber and wood, clearing vegetation for grazing and agriculture, and the introduction of plants and animals by humans has displaced much of the native vegetation. The laurisilva has been reduced to small pockets. As a result, many of the endemic biota of the islands are seriously endangered or extinct.

Blair wanted to reunite the North and the South during the war. Blair helped to create the Republican Party. He supported many Democrats, but was mostly the ally of Republican President Abraham Lincoln. He is nicknamed The Father of the Republican Party since he was one of the men who started the Republican Party.
Blair was born at Abingdon, Virginia on April 12, 1791. He moved to Kentucky and later graduated from Transylvania University in 1811. Blair became a journalist in Frankfort, Kentucky and Washington D.C., and a prominent leader of the Democrats. He was married to Eliza Violet Gist from 1812 until his death in 1876. They had five children. He founded Silver Spring, the second largest city in Maryland, in 1840.
Blair helped create the Republican Party and supported the first nominee of the party, Abraham Lincoln. All though he had slaves, Blair was said that after the Mexican War that slavery should not be extended beyond where it was allowed. In 1848, he actively supported Martin Van Buren, the Free Soil Party candidate, for the presidency, and in 1852 he supported Franklin Pierce, but soon afterwards helped to organize the new Republican Party for Anti-Slavery purposes, and went to a convention at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in February 1856.
Blair wanted John C. Frémont for president and supported him at the June 1856 convention. At the 1860 convention he supported the nomination of Edward Bates as president. When it was clear that Bates would not be nominated, so then Blair supported the nomination of Abraham Lincoln. Blair helped many democratic politicians to vote yes on making slavery illegal and becoming the 13th amendment.
Blair asked President Lincoln that once Savannah, Georgia fell, he should travel to the capital of the Confederacy in Richmond, Virginia to talk to President Jefferson Davis, whom he knew. He organized a peace conference that failed.
In 1862, Blair had told his slaves that they could "go when they wished." He said that "all but one declined the privilege," choosing to stay on as servants.
Blair died on October 18, 1876 in Silver Spring, Maryland from natural causes, aged 85. He was later buried at Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C. His wife, Eliza, died on July 5, 1877, a year after his death.

Harry Tjutjuna

Harry Tjutjuna is an Aboriginal artist from central Australia. He belongs to the Pitjantjatjara people. Tjutjuna began painting in 2005. He held his first solo exhibition in 2007, in Darwin. His work is now held in several major public galleries in Australia, including the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Gallery of Victoria, and the National Gallery of Australia. His painting ' (Bilby Dreaming Story) was a finalist for the Togard Contemporary Art Award in 2009. In 2010 and 2011, another of Tjutjuna's paintings, ', was chosen as a finalist in both the Western Australian Indigenous Art Awards, and the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award (NATSIAA).
Tjutjuna was born around 1930. He was born in the bushland close to what is now the community of Pipalyatjara in the north-west corner of South Australia. Sources disagree on where exactly he was born. Some say he was born at Walytjatjara, a place to the north-east of Pipalyatjara, just over the border in the Northern Territory. Others say that he was born at Mount Davies, a hill that overlooks Pipalyatjara.
When Tjutjuna was still young, his family settled at Ernabella. He went to school on the mission there and later worked as a labourer for the community. He later moved back west to live in the communities of Irrunytju and Pipalyatjara after they were established. He moved there with his wives and children to be closer to his homeland. In his later life, Tjutjuna became known as an important traditional healer (') and law man (') for the Pitjantjatjara.
Tjutjuna began painting in late 2005, when he was aged in his mid-seventies. He was living again at Ernabella, and began to paint for the community's art company Ernabella Arts. His work at Ernabella depicted "Tjukurpa" (traditional law or stories from the Dreamtime). It supported a shift in subject matter for the centre's artists, from quite secular to more spiritual subjects. In 2008, Tjutjuna moved back to Pipalyatjara and began work for Ninuku Arts.
Tjutjuna paints concepts and stories from his Dreaming (spirituality). His main personal totem is a spider ('), and his Dreaming revolves around the (Spider Man Dreaming). According to his Dreaming, which was passed on to him from previous generations, Tjutjuna's ancestor is a powerful being known as the Spider Man. This creature is said to have created Tjutjuna's country in the Dreamtime, and so Tjutjuna associates his country, his heritage and himself with this set of beliefs. In this way, the paintings are autobiographical in addition to depicting traditional stories. Tjutjuna identifies himself as the Spider Man, and his paintings are often seen to symbolise his work as a ' (healer). Because his totem is a spider, he uses spider webs to treat wounds on people's skin.
Tjutjuna also paints figures from several other Dreaming stories associated with his country, such as the Wati Maḻu (Red Kangaroo Man) and the Kungka Mingkiri (Mice Women). Many of the paintings have sexual themes. One of Tjutjuna's most famous paintings, "", is a composition of two Dreaming stories. It depicts the story of the Kungkarungkara (Seven Sisters), which is about the constellations of Pleiades (the sisters) and Orion. Tjutjuna painted it from the male's perspective. , a shape-shifting man, chases the seven sisters and catches the youngest, raping her. The other story depicted is from the Spider Man Dreaming. The painting was chosen as a finalist for the Western Australian Indigenous Art Awards in 2010, and the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2011.
Tjutjuna paints in the typical style of the Western Desert, which can be seen as very abstract. The figures in his paintings, ancestral beings, are obscured and encoded for cultural reasons. He uses fields of dots to represent their interactions, and lines to represent their journeys across the landscape. The landscape is depicted with the earthly colours of the desert (reds, oranges, ochres and white). In his works depicting , he often paints circular patterns across the background. This motif is used to represent both a spider's web and the spider man's many women. Tjutjuna is also known for drip paintings.

Binocular vision

Binocular vision is vision in which both eyes are used together. It can mean having two eyes instead of one, but more often it means having a visual field which is put together by the brain with input from both eyes. This is the standard equipment for vertebrates and many other types of animals.
Humans have a maximum horizontal field of view of about 200 degrees with two eyes. About 120 degrees make up the binocular field of view (seen by both eyes), and two side fields of about 40 degrees seen by only one eye.
Our system of vision gives precise depth information, called stereopsis. Such binocular vision is usually accompanied by singleness of vision or "binocular fusion", in which a single image is seen even though each eye has its own image of an object. 
Stereopsis is the impression of depth we get when we look at a scene with both eyes. Binocular viewing of a scene creates two slightly different images of the scene in the two eyes due to the eyes' different positions on the head. These differences give information that the brain uses to calculate depth in the visual scene. The term 'stereopsis' is often used as short hand for 'binocular vision', 'binocular depth perception' or 'stereoscopic depth perception', though strictly speaking, the impression of depth associated with stereopsis can also be got under other conditions, such as when an observer views a scene with only one eye while moving. Observer motion creates differences in the single retinal image over time similar to binocular disparity; this is referred to as "motion parallax". 
Some animals, usually but not always prey animals, have their two eyes positioned on opposite sides of their heads to give the widest possible field of view. Examples include rabbits, buffaloes, and antelopes. In such animals, the eyes often move independently to increase the field of view. Even without moving their eyes, some birds have a 360-degree field of view.
Other animals, usually but not always predatory animals, have their two eyes positioned on the front of their heads, thereby allowing for binocular vision and reducing their field of view in favor of stereopsis. Examples include humans, eagles, wolves, and snakes.
Some predator animals, particularly large ones such as sperm whales and killer whales, have their two eyes positioned on opposite sides of their heads. Other animals that are not necessarily predators, such as fruit bats and a number of primates also have forward facing eyes. These are usually animals that need fine depth discrimination/perception; for instance, binocular vision improves the ability to pick a chosen fruit or to find and grasp a particular branch.
In animals with forward-facing eyes, the eyes usually move together. Some animals use both strategies. A starling, for example, has laterally placed eyes to cover a wide field of view, but can also move them together to point to the front so their fields overlap giving stereopsis. A remarkable example is the chameleon, whose eyes appear to be mounted on turrets, each moving independently of the other, up or down, left or right. Nevertheless, the chameleon can bring both of its eyes to bear on a single object when it is hunting.

Fredrik Bajer

Fredrik Bajer (April 21, 1837 – January 22, 1922) was a Danish writer, teacher, and pacifist politician. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1908.
Bajer was born on April 21, 1837 in Vester Egede, Denmark. He was fighting in the 1864 war against Prussia and Austria where he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. He was discharged in 1865, and moved to Copenhagen where he became a teacher, translator and writer.
He entered the Danish Parliament in 1872 as a member of Folketinget and held a seat there for the following 23 years. As a member of parliament, he worked for the use of international arbitration to solve conflicts among nations, and it is due to Bajer's efforts that foreign relations became part of the work of the Danish Parliament and that Denmark participated in the Inter-Parliamentary Union from the beginning and earned a distinguished position among its members.
He supported many peace organizations, both inside Denmark and Europe-wide. He helped guide the passage of a bill to reach arbitration agreements with Sweden and Norway.
Bajer died on January 22, 1922 in Copenhagen, Denmark from unknown causes, aged 84.
