G. L. Pridgen

Gaston Layton Pridgen, known as G. L. Pridgen (born ca. 1944), is a Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly and the North Carolina House of Representatives. In the House of Representatives, he represents the 46th District, including constituents in Hoke, Robeson and Scotland counties. A retired telecommunications technician from Laurinburg, North Carolina, Pridgen also has experience in the United States Military.
Pridgen was born in Robeson County, where he graduated from Littlefield High School and studied at Robeson Community College. His career with Southern Bell Telephone Company, which later became BellSouth Telecommunications and then AT&T, was interrupted by two years of service in the United States Army. Drafted into the army, he served as a communication lineman in Vietnam with the rank of Specialist-5, and was awarded the Bronze Star.
In 1994, he started his own telecommunications company, The Communications Company, Inc., providing telecommunications to local businesses. In 2009 he began working in the IT Department at Southeastern Regional Medical Center.
Pridgen is currently serving his first term as Representative for District 46 of North Carolina. In the House of Representatives he is active on seven committees. These are the Agriculture committee, the Appropriations committee (both Appropriations and Appropriations of Education, for which he is Vice-Chair) and the committees on Education, Judiciary (and Judiciary subcommittee B), and Public Utilities.
Pridgen has been the primary sponsor of eleven bills and has co-sponsored twenty-eight other bills, including H475 which authorizes a referendum on whether to make English the official language of North Carolina. He was also a primary sponsor of bill H219 which aimed to keep stricter records of registered sex offenders in the state. Pridgen nominated Dick Taylor to serve on the University of North Carolina Board of Governors. Pridgen also served as Vice-Chairman of the Appropriations Committee for Education. In this role, he supported a motion that would allow extra tax revenue to help fund the University of North Carolina system schools. This came less than a week after the committee proposed a budget for the UNC-system of schools that would have reduced funding by $483 million, or 17.4 percent. The cuts were described as potentially causing the school system to lose 3,200 jobs and cut 9,000 classes.
Pridgen has four children with his wife, Wendy.

Pat Cadigan

Pat Cadigan is an American science fiction author. Her work is part of the cyberpunk movement. Her novels and short stories all share a common theme of exploring the relationship between the human mind and technology. 
She was born in Schenectady, New York, and grew up in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. Cadigan was a student at the University of Massachusetts and the University of Kansas. She studied with James Gunn at Kansas and graduated in 1975. That same year Cadigan joined the convention committee for MidAmeriCon, the 34th World Science Fiction Convention being held in Kansas City, Missouri over Labor Day weekend 1976. Her job as a committee member was to help guest of honor Robert A. Heinlein.
She also worked for fantasy writer Tom Reamy at his Nickelodeon Graphics typesetting and graphic design business. Reamy died in 1977 and Cadigan went to work as a writer for Kansas City's Hallmark Cards. She went to live in England with her son Bob Fenner in 1996. She is now married there to her third husband.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, she was a magazine editor. She worked on small press fantasy and science fiction magazines called "Chacal" and" Shayol" with her second husband, Arnie Fenner. Cadigan sold her first professional science fiction story in 1980. She became a full-time writer in 1987.
Cadigan's first novel was "Mindplayers". It introduced a common theme in her writing. Her stories make the human mind a real place where people can go and do things. What is real becomes unclear.
Cadigan has won several awards, including: Nebula Award for Best Short Story in 1986; the Philip K. Dick Award in 1987 for "Mindplayers"; the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1991; the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1992 and 1995 for her novels "Synners" and "Fools". 
Robert A. Heinlein had become her friend after she helped him when he was a guest at the 34th Worldcon in Kansas City. He partly dedicated his novel "Friday" to her.
In the 1960s, Cadigan and a childhood girlfriend "invented a whole secret life in which we were twins from the planet Venus," she told National Public Radio. The Beatles asked "us for advice about their songs" and help being famous, Cadigan says. In this fantasy, sometimes the girls would shape-shift to become The Beatles and finish recording songs or playing concerts for them. As Venusian twins, Cadigan said they had other superpowers too. Sometimes they would help Superman, Wonder Woman and other heroes, she said.
One of her early stories appeared in "Rock On" (1981).

Iris (goddess)

Iris was known as the goddess of the rainbow and another messenger for the gods in Greek mythology. 
She is depicted as a beautiful golden goddess, with wings (for flight), sandals, a staff, and a tunic. There is often much art, such as vases and murals, shown of her because she is worshiped and very beautiful. She was also seen briefly in Homer's "Legacies".
Iris is generally seen as Hera's personal servant and messenger. Iris is very swift and fast and she generally travels by rainbow. It is even said that the reason the rainbow comes and goes so fast is because Iris only uses it for travel and since she is so fast, it is only in the sky for a small amount of time. 
She is seen today in both Roman, and Greek mythology, as an important figure to Greece, and the gods. In Greek mythology it is believed that if you throw a drachma (Greek currency) into a rainbow you can communicate with anyone anywhere (like the Skype of ancient times).
Her parents are Thaumas (marine titan) and Elektra (cloud nymph). Her husband is Zephryus (west wind). In some versions of Greek mythology, Iris is the mother of Pothos.

The club´s president was Frank Stronach, the founder of Magna Inetrnational. He was also the main sponsor. But he decided to leave the club, so the future of the club is not clear. For the 2011/12 season Wiener Neustadt has got a new coach, Peter Stöger, who came from GAK, because Peter Schöttl became new coach of SK Rapid Wien. After Peter Stöger went to Austria Wien, because the earlier Austria coach Ivica Vastic was not very successful, the team had to look for a new coach.

Dental formula

A dental formula is a summary of a mammal's teeth.
Almost all mammals have four kinds of teeth:
Teeth numbers and form have adapted to different feeding methods. Over time, different mammal groups have evolved distinct dental features, in the number and type of teeth, and in the shape and size of the chewing surface.
The number of teeth of each type is written as a dental formula for one side of the mouth, or quadrant, with the upper and lower teeth shown on separate rows. The number of teeth in a mouth is twice that listed as there are two sides. 
In each set, incisors (I) are indicated first, canines (C) second, premolars (P) third, and finally molars (M), giving I:C:P:M. So for example, the formula 2.1.2.3 for upper teeth indicates 2 incisors, 1 canine, 2 premolars, and 3 molars on one side of the upper mouth. 
The deciduous dental formula is notated in lowercase lettering preceded by the letter d: e.g. di:dc:dm. An animal's dentition for either deciduous or permanent teeth can thus be expressed as a dental formula, written in the form of a fraction: I.C.P.M / I.C.P.M.
Since the teeth are always listed in the same order, the letters can be dropped, thus:
Both felines and horses have a large diastema, or gap, between their front teeth and their back teeth. This is a natural feature in many types of mammal.

Horror punk

Horror punk (sometimes referred to as horror rock) is a dark style of music mixing Gothic and Punk Rock sounds with morbid imagery. Often, song topics are taken from horror films, horror punk bands create an atmosphere by telling tales through their songs. It is closely related to an often overlaps with the Death Rock movement; while Death Rock tends to lean more towards the Goth sound, Horror Punk leans towards a Doo-Wop sound.
The Misfits are recognized as the progenitors of the Horror Punk subgenre. Misfits first Horror Punk recording sessions can be traced back to 1977. In 1982 Misfits released their first full length album Walk Among Us. Influenced by The Misfits another early Punk band TSOL released a Horror Punk album called Dance with Me in the early 1980s. 
The genre, with the exception of artists like Jack Grisham (on the left) and Michale Graves (on the right), is generally apolitical.
Horror hardcore is a term coined by Dwid Hellion that refers to a hybrid of horror punk and hardcore punk. The Misfits' third album, "Earth A.D.", and the early work of Glenn Danzig's subsequent band Samhain inaugurated the style. Septic Death and Integrity also performed this subgenre. 
Horror metal is a term which originated in the 1980s to describe Ripper's first album. Since then, a number of bands playing several different styles of metal have fallen under this banner, including Necrophagia and The Vision Bleak.

Paleolithic diet

The modern diet known as the paleolithic diet (abbreviated as 'paleo diet' or 'paleodiet') is a way of eating. It is also called the 'caveman diet', 'Stone Age diet' or 'hunter-gatherer diet'. 
It is based on the wild plants and animals which humans ate in the Paleolithic era. This was a period about 2.5 million years long: it ended around 10,000 years ago, when people began farming. The term "Paleolithic diet" may also refer to what people actually ate back then instead of the diet today.<ref name=doi:10.1080/11026480510032043>
</ref><ref name="doi10.1080/11026480510031990"></ref>
Meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, roots, and nuts make up most of the modern Paleolithic diet. It does not include grains, legumes, dairy products, salt, refined sugar, and processed oils. The diet is much lower in carbohydrates than is usual today, and much higher in protein.
Walter L. Voegtlin first made the modern Paleolithic diet popular in the 1970s.
Authors and researchers recommended and changed the diet in several books and academic journals.
Paleolithic nutrition is based on the idea in evolution that modern humans are genetically adapted to the way their Paleolithic ancestors ate, and that human genetics have not changed much since people began growing their own food. Therefore a good way of eating today would be like how people ate then.
The basic idea is that the diet is healthy because our body is adapted to make use of it. Two studies of the Paleolithic diet in humans have shown good things for people's health.
This way of eating is somewhat controversial among nutritionists.
and anthropologists.
Some argue that if hunter gatherer societies did not suffer from certain diseases, this was because they ate food with fewer calories, or for other reasons. They also say it may not be how people really ate in the Paleolithic era.<ref name="doi10.1046/j.1467-3010.2000.00019.x"></ref>
There is a wide consensus that present-day diets in first world countries is causing damage and serious health problems. One expert review said:
The huge intake of calories is not balanced, as it once was, by the hard work needed to stay alive and do the hard work necessary to live. The industrial revolution changed work in all walks of life. Now machines do the hard work.
And it is not just a question of fat and carbohydrates. The consumption of sodium salt is hugely greater today than ever before. 
These present-day eating habits, and the lack of exercise, lead to cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis and cancer, and to obesity in the US and other Western countries. 
According to S. Boyd Eaton, "we are the heirs of inherited characteristics accrued over millions of years; the vast majority of our biochemistry and physiology are tuned to life conditions that existed before the advent of agriculture some 10,000 years ago. Genetically our bodies are virtually the same as they were at the end of the Paleolithic era some 20,000 years ago".
Ideas about paleolithic nutrition come from evolutionary biology. The reason for eating like this is that natural selection had enough time for Paleolithic humans' bodies and metabolisms to get used to the food that they could eat then. But in the 10,000 years since people started farming, natural selection has not had enough time for people's genetics to change to get used to the new diet. This has led to some diseases.
More than 70% of the total daily energy consumed by all people in the United States comes from foods such as dairy products, cereals, refined sugars, refined vegetable oils and alcohol, that Paleolithic supporters say were not eaten during the Paleolithic era. However, there is evidence that Paleolithic societies may have been using cereals for food use at least as early as 23,000 years ago, more than 100,000 years ago, and perhaps as early as 200,000 years ago. However, Loren Cordain has said that the new evidence shows that grains were not eaten much back then, and he has also said that eating of wild grass seeds of any kind needs technology and processing to make the food possible to eat, and that this technology was probably not around 105,000+ years ago.
Disagreements are not about the background consensus described above. It is about how good the Paleolithic diet is as a solution to that problem. It is also about whether the argument behind the diet is a sound argument.
Not everybody agrees with evolutionary reasons behind the Paleoithic diet. According to Alexander Ströhle, Maike Wolters and Andreas Hahn, with the Department of Food Science at the University of Hanover, saying the human genome evolved during the Pleistocene (a period from 1,808,000 to 11,550 years ago) is not based on the right beliefs about evolution. 
They also say that 10,000 years may have been enough time for people to adapt to diets with food grown through farming. For example, alleles that helped people eat dairy became common in Europe just a few thousand years after people started raising animals. There is also evidence that the diet of Stone Age humans may have had some form the refined starches and grains that are not part of the paleolithic diet. A 2010 study showed the discovery of a 30,000 year old mortar and pestle from which flour of several plants were isolated.

Specialty Records was an American record label from Los Angeles. It was founded as Juke Box Records in 1946, but renamed by its owner Art Rupe when separated from some of his former partners. Speciality is known for its rhythm and blues, blues, gospel and early rock and roll music which the label recorded. Specialty also had two music publishing companies, Venice Music and Greenwich Music. During the 1960s Speciality stopped the recordings and only sold the old records. In 1968, because of interest in the early days of rock and roll, Rupe started the label again and reissued much of the old material.
Art Rupe was famous for being one of the most honest men in recording business. He paid and recorded his musicians well and he never paid for being played in the radio. On Speciality you can hear some of the wildest rhythm and blues of this time because Rupe gave a lot of freedom to his musicians.
In 1991 the label was sold to the Concord Music Group which has reissued albums by a number of Specialty's original artists.

Funk rock

Funk rock (also typed as funk-rock) is a music genre that fuses funk and rock elements.
Its earliest incarnation was heard in the late 1960s through the mid-1970s by acts such as the Jimi Hendrix Experience (last two albums), Eric Burdon and War, Trapeze, Parliament-Funkadelic, Betty Davis and Mother's Finest. In the 1990s acts such as Prince, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rage Against the Machine and Faith No More revived the genre.
Funk rock is a fusion of funk and rock. Many instruments may be incorporated into the music, but the overall sound is defined by a definitive bass or drum beat and electric guitars. The bass and drum rhythms are influenced by funk music but with more intensity, while the guitar can be funk-or-rock-influenced, usually with distortion, which is similar to overdrive or fuzz.

Rage Against the Machine's mix of funk and metal not only included rap, but also elements of punk rock. Primus, a band that has never had a clear genre, have been called things such as "thrash metal-funk meets Don Knotts, Jr.Living Colour have been cited by "Rolling Stone" as "Black-funk-metal pioneers."
Certain bands not from an alternative background, such as Bang Tango and Extreme, have also frequently incorporated funk into their musical style.

Critics considered Fishbone to be one of the most distinctive and varied bands of the late '80s. With their hyperactive, self-conscious diversity, goofy sense of humor, and sharp social commentary, the group gained a large cult following during the late '80s, yet they never became mainstream.

Prosthesis

A prosthesis is a device made to replace a missing human body part. They are used by people who are missing body parts due to accidents, health problems (amputees) or being born without them. Originally, prostheses were simply pieces of wood (for example, wooden legs), but now they are made of lighter materials.  
Currently available prostheses can help return mobility to those with transtibial (below the knee), transfemoral (above the knee), transradial (below the elbow), and transhumeral (above the elbow) amputations. There is still much research to be done before artificial limbs can function with the same versatility as a natural limb; as a result many of the currently available prosthetic limbs are tailored to a specific activity or need. 
In Para-alpine skiing, the device needs to be made to work like an ankle because the way the ankle moves is very important in skiing. The device for skiing is only used in skiing. People use other prostheses when they are not skiing.
Prosthetic arms can be designed for climbing as well. Private Jaco Van Gass, an amputee veteran, designed a special prosthetic arm with a built in ice pick that he would use to climb Mount Everest. It also includes a battery pack and heat patch to keep his stump warm. 
Olympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius also had prostheses designs specifically for spot. He used carbon fiber running blades that, some argue, give an advantage over natural legs.
A traditional prosthetic limb consists of three main components: a socket, an attachment mechanism, and a control system.
The socket is the part of the prosthetic that attaches to the users natural body. A precise fit is extremely important to the function of the limb, so typically molds are taken of a patient’s residual limb to ensure the fit is ideal. If it does not fit correctly, the socket could cause severe tissue damage to the patient. 
The attachment mechanism is a means of securely anchoring the limb in a way that is both comfortable and easy for the user to control. The attachment mechanism may work by tension (straps) or even merely by suction between the socket and the limb. 
The control system varies greatly from limb to limb. Some are controlled entirely by the user’s motion; he or she learns to balance on it. In other cases, cables are pulled to cause a limb to bend in the desired direction. 
Today, the most promising control system is the myoelectric signal. This technology is allowing for thought-controlled prosthetics to be developed.

Palearctic

The Palearctic (or 'Palaearctic') ecozone is one of the eight dividing the Earth's surface.
The Palearctic is by far the largest ecozone. It includes the terrestrial ecoregions of Europe, Asia north of the Himalayan foothills, northern Africa, and the northern and central parts of the Arabian Peninsula. 
The Palearctic ecozone includes mostly boreal and temperate climate ecoregions, which run across Eurasia from western Europe to the Bering Strait.
The boreal and temperate Euro-Siberian region is the Palearctic's largest biogeographic region, which transitions from tundra in the northern reaches of Russia and Scandinavia to the vast taiga, the boreal coniferous forests which run across the continent. South of the taiga are a belt of temperate broadleaf and mixed forests and temperate coniferous forests. This vast Euro-Siberian region has many shared plant and animal species, and many similarities with the temperate and boreal regions of the Nearctic of North America. 
Eurasia and North America were often connected by the Bering land bridge, and have very similar mammal and bird fauna, with many Eurasian species having moved into North America, and fewer North American species having moved into Eurasia. 
Many zoologists consider the Palearctic and Nearctic to be a single Holarctic ecozone. The Palearctic and Nearctic also share many plant species.
The lands bordering the Mediterranean Sea in southern Europe, north Africa, and western Asia are home to the Mediterranean basin ecoregions, which together constitute world's largest and most diverse mediterranean climate region of the world, with generally mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. The Mediterranean basin's mosaic of forests, woodlands, and scrub are home to 13,000 endemic species. "Conservation International" has designated the Mediterranean basin as one of the world's biodiversity hotspots.
A great belt of deserts, including the Sahara desert, and Arabian desert, separates the Palearctic and Afrotropic ecoregions. These desert ecoregions are included in the palearctic ecozone; other biogeographers identify the ecozone boundary as the transition zone between the desert ecoregions and the Mediterranean basin ecoregions to the north. This would place the deserts in the Afrotropic, while others place the boundary through the middle of the desert.
The Caucasus mountains, which run between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, are a particularly rich mix of coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed forests, and include some temperate rain forest.
Central Asia and the Iranian plateau are home to dry steppe grasslands and desert basins, with montane forests, woodlands, and grasslands in the region's high mountains and plateaux.
The middle altitude foothills of the Himalaya between about 2000–2500 m form the boundary between the Palearctic and Indomalaya ecoregions.
China, Korea and Japan are more humid and temperate than adjacent Siberia and Central Asia, and are home to rich temperate coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed forests. These are now mostly limited to mountainous areas, as the densely populated lowlands and river basins have been converted to intensive agricultural and urban use. 
East Asia was not much affected by glaciation in the ice ages, and retained 96 percent of Pliocene tree genera, while Europe retained only 27 percent.

<doc id="293693" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=293693" title="Holarctic">
Holarctic

The Holarctic ecozone refers to the habitats found throughout the northern continents of the world as a whole. 
This region is divided into the Palearctic and the Nearctic. The palearctic is Northern Africa and all of Eurasia, with the exception of Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The Nearctic is North America north of southern Mexico. 
These are further subdivided into a variety of ecoregions. Many ecosystems, and the animal and plant communities that depend on them, are found across multiple continents in large portions of this ecozone. 
The continuity of these ecosystems results from the shared glacial history of this ecozone. Also, during glacial periods, mammal fauna was able to cross from Asia to North America via the Bering Strait.

Afrotropic

The Afrotropic is one of the Earth's eight ecozones. The zone was formerly known as the Ethiopian Zone.
The zone includes Africa south of the Sahara, the southern and eastern parts of the Arabian Peninsula, the island of Madagascar, southern Iran, extreme southwestern Pakistan, and the islands of the western Indian Ocean. Almost all this land was part of the ancient southern supercontinent of Gondwana, which started to break up 150 million years ago.
Because Africa is a very large continent, and runs north/south acrsoss the equator, the zone has many different climates and habitats.
Most of the Afrotropic, has a tropical climate. A broad belt of deserts separate the Afrotropic from the Palearctic ecozone, which includes northern Africa and temperate Eurasia.
South of the Sahara, two belts of tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas and shrublands run east and west across the continent, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ethiopian Highlands. 
Immediately south of the Sahara lies the Sahel belt, a transitional zone of semi-arid short grassland and Acacia savanna. 
Rainfall increases further south in the Sudan, a belt of taller grasslands and savannas. The Sudanian savanna is home to two great flooded grasslands and savannas, the Sudd wetland in the Sudan, and the Niger Inland Delta in Mali.
South Arabia, mostly Yemen and parts of western Oman and southwest Saudi Arabia, has few permanent forests. Otherwise woodlands scatter the land and are very small Juniper or Acacia forests.
A belt of lowland tropical moist broadleaf forests, runs across most of equatorial Africa. 
The largest tropical forest zone in Africa are the forests of the Congo Basin in Central Africa. A belt of tropical moist broadleaf forest also runs along the Indian Ocean coast, from southern Somalia to South Africa.
The Great Rift Valley gives East Africa its unique mix of deep lakes, highlands, volcanoes and grassland.
Woodlands, savannas, grasslands and desert.
Madagascar and neighboring islands form a distinctive sub-region of the ecozone, with numerous endemic taxa like the lemurs. 
Madagascar and the Seychelles are not part of Africa, and that explains why the advanced primates of Africa (monkeys, apes) are not found in Madagascar. This is because Madagascar has not been connected to Africa since the break-up of Gondwana. Lemurs are found occupying more or less the same ecological niches as monkeys do in Africa.
Other Indian ocean islands, like the Comoros and Mascarene Islands, are volcanic islands that formed more recently. Madagascar contains several important biospheres: its biodiversity and numbers of unique species is high.

<doc id="293709" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=293709" title="Fort Belvedere, Surrey">
Fort Belvedere, Surrey

Fort Belvedere is a country house on Shrubs Hill in Windsor Great Park, England, very near Sunningdale, Berkshire, but actually over the border in the borough of Runnymede in Surrey. It is a former royal residence - from 1750 to 1976 - and is most famous for being the home of King Edward VIII. Fort Belvedere is still owned by the Crown, and is now occupied by private tenants, Canadian businessman Galen Weston and his wife Hilary Weston, the former Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario.
Fort Belvedere was built 1750-1755, for Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, younger son of George II and Queen Caroline, famous for his role in the Battle of Culloden. It was, at first, merely a folly (a building built as art, instead of having a purely practical purposes). It was used as a summer-house, and seven counties could be seen, as now, from the top of the flagstaff tower. The triangular turreted structure was set in a dense plantation of trees and overlooked Virginia Water, a man-made body of water constructed by Thomas and Paul Sandby at the request of the Duke.
Sir Jeffrey Wyattville, who was responsible for the rebuilding of Windsor Castle under George IV, enlarged the house in 1828, for use as a hunting lodge. Additions included an octagon room in the North-East side, where the King regularly had dinner.
The new work included the extension of the military appearance of the house, though it never had any military use. A set of 31 guns, cast 1729-1749 by the first master founder at the Royal Foundry, later the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, were used to fire salutes until 1907, often for Queen Victoria who was a frequent visitor. The Bombardier entrusted with the care of the guns lived in Bombardier’s Cottage, connected to the main house by an archway.
Later the property was used by a variety of royals, or their servants. In 1911, the old building was converted into a residence, and was used by Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. The fort has 7 bedrooms.
The ruins in the grounds can be seen from the shore of Virginia Water and are part of an ancient temple brought from Leptis Magna near Tripoli. The ruins are located between the south shore and Blacknest Road close to the junction with the A30 London Road and Wentworth Drive.
In 1929, the building became vacant, and was given to Prince Edward, the Prince of Wales by his father, King George V. This became the Prince's chief residence, and was used extensively by the Prince for entertaining and as a country retreat. When he became King in 1936, Edward continued to use the Fort, even though he now had a much wider choice of residences to live in.
The Prince of Wales was resident 1930-36. During his tenure extensive remodelling to the interior was carried out. Interior decorator Herman Schrijver, who had decorated the home of the prince's future wife, Wallis Simpson, worked on the Fort's interiors in 1935.
The Fort became the setting of the Abdication crisis during 1936, when Edward abdicated the throne following the British and Dominion governments' opposition to his marriage to Wallis Simpson. Edward held his final meetings with British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin and signed the Instrument of Abdication, witnessed by his brothers, at the Fort.
During World War II, the Fort was used by the Office of the Commissioners of Crown Lands, which had been evacuated from their central London offices. After the War the house stayed empty. The Hon. Gerald Lascelles, younger son of Mary, the Princess Royal (daughter of King George V) was the tenant 1956-1975, on a 99 year lease. He restored the gardens, and added a swimming pool, and tennis court. In 1976 the Emir of Dubai moved in. More recently the house has been home to Galen Weston, the Canadian owner of Selfridges PLC (and whose wife Hilary was Lieutenant Governor of Ontario 1996-2001). The Crown Estate Commissioners remain the owners of the freehold, as the property is still part of the Great Park.

Australasian ecozone

The Australasian zone is an ecological region which fits the geographic region of Australasia. That means Australia, New Guinea and neighbouring islands. The northern boundary is the Wallace Line. 
The ecozone includes Australia, the island of New Guinea (including Papua New Guinea and the Indonesian province of Papua). 
The smaller islands include the eastern part of the Indonesian archipelago, including the island of Sulawesi, the Moluccan islands (the Indonesian provinces of Maluku and North Maluku) and islands of Lombok, Sumbawa, Sumba, Flores, and Timor, often known as the Lesser Sundas. 
The Australasian ecozone also includes several Pacific island groups, including the Bismarck Archipelago, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and New Caledonia. New Zealand and its surrounding islands are a distinctive sub-region of the Australasian ecozone. The rest of Indonesia is part of the Indomalayan ecozone. 
The Australasian continental plate was once attached to Antarctica as part of the Gondwana supercontinent. The peculiarity of its flora and fauna is due to its long separation from the rest of the world. Apart from some birds, and until recent introductions by man, the native life had been undisturbed by invasions. The ecozone has the only two living monotremes, and has no native eutherian mammals. 
Almost all its native mammals (except the two monotremes) are marsupials. The indisputable remains of Australian placental mammals started from the Miocene, when Australia moved closer to Indonesia. After 15 million years ago (mya) bats appeared in the fossil record, and after 5-10 mya rodents did, and 1 mya rats arrived. This information is based on the fossil record. Several thousand years ago, man brought the dingo, and 200 years ago many more species. This information applies to Australia. The fauna of New Zealand, and the Pacific islands shows a different pattern. There the migrations from the Indomalayan ecozone mostly did not arrive.
Alfred Russell Wallace found the dividing line between the Australasian ecozone and the rest of the world. It runs between the islands of Lombok (Australasia) and Bali (Indomalaya).

Newcastle Waters is a small settlement near the Stuart Highway in the Northern Territory. It is 777 km north of Alice Springs and 705 km south of Darwin. It is inside Newcastle Waters station, a large cattle station with over 45,000 head of cattle. The station covers 10,353 square kilometers. The nearest petrol station and accommodation is found 23 kilometres (14 miles) south at Elliott. 
Newcastle Waters was named by the explorer, John McDouall Stuart in 1861. He named it after the Duke of Newcastle. The waterhole Stuart discovered is now called the Longreach Hole. When the Australian Overland Telegraph Line was built, a relay station was built at Newcastle Waters in 1870. The cattle station was set up in 1883. In 1930 the government set aside an area of the station for a town site. It was an important stop for moving cattle herds through the Northern Territory. However in the 1960's as cattle were moved by trucks, the town was abandoned. The buildings in the town are now in poor condition.

Kupang

Kupang is the provincial capital of East Nusa Tenggara province in southeast Indonesia.
The city is in West Timor on the island of Timor, and had a population estimated in 2012 at 450,000. It is surrounded by (but is separate from) the regency of Kupang, which had a population estimated in 2009 at 394,173. It is the biggest city and port on the island of Timor.
Kupang's economy is mainly based on its cement industry and the export and import of goods from its busy port. The airport of Kupang El Tari (IATA-Code: KOE), is approximately 8 km from the city center to the east. As capital of East Nusa Tenggara, the transport and administrative links from Kupang with isolated islands are extensive.
The location was an important port and trading point during the Portuguese and Dutch colonial eras. There are ruins and remnant signs of the colonial presence in the city.
The city was an important landing and refueling place for early long distance airplane flights between Europe and Australia in the early twentieth century. It was an important location during the conflict in East Timor, for the Indonesian military, as well as the militias. The camps around Kupang were also of significant impact on the city.
In 1962, the University of Nusa Cendana was established, and the city became important both in the field of education and also economically.
In 1967, the city was made the seat of the Diocese of Kupang. In 1989 the diocese was elevated to become the Archdiocese of Kupang.
Kupang was the final destination of William Bligh who was set adrift in an open boat during the Mutiny on the Bounty (1789). The Mutiny on the Bounty took place about 30 nautical miles (56 km) from Tofua. Lt William Bligh navigated the overcrowded 23 foot (7 m) open launch on an epic 41-day voyage first to Tofua and then to the West Timor city of Kupang equipped only with a sextant and a pocket watch— no charts or compass. He recorded the distance as 3,618 nautical miles (6710 km). He passed through the difficult Torres Strait along the way and landed on June 14. The only casualty of his voyage was a crewman named John Norton who was stoned to death by the natives of Tofua, the first island they tried to land on.
News of the journey of Captain Bligh inspired the escape of a party of convicts from the penal colony at Sydney Cove, Australia. A group of nine convicts and two children, led by William Bryant, stole a small uncovered government boat and escaped from Port Jackson, Australia. Ten weeks later, they arrived at Kupang, having covered , a feat as remarkable as Blighs, given that only three members of the group had any sailing experience.
Kupang is the first port of call for yachts in the annual Sail Indonesia rally which starts in Darwin, Australia towards the end of July each year. In 2006 about 100 yachts from around the world took part in the rally. From Kupang yachts head north to Alor and then stop at various ports in Indonesia over a period of about three months ending up in Singapore.
Kupang has a sister city relationship with:

Benedict Arnold

Benedict Arnold V ( – 14 June 1801) was a general during the American Revolutionary War. He began the war in the Continental Army but later changed to the British Army. While a general on the American side he became commander of the fort at West Point, New York, and plotted to surrender it to the British forces. After the plot was exposed in September 1780, he was made a brigadier general in the British Army.
Born in Connecticut, Arnold was a merchant operating ships on the Atlantic Ocean when the war broke out in 1775. After joining the growing army outside Boston, he distinguished himself through acts of cunning and bravery. His actions included 
In spite of successes, Arnold was passed over for promotion by the Continental Congress while other officers claimed credit for some of his accomplishments. Adversaries in military and political circles brought charges of corruption or other wrongdoing, but he was acquitted in most formal inquiries. Congress investigated his accounts, and found that he owed it money after he had spent much of his own money on the war effort. 
Frustrated and bitter, Arnold decided to change sides in 1779, and opened secret negotiations with the British. In July 1780, he asked for, and got, command of West Point in order to surrender it to the British. Arnold's scheme was exposed when American forces captured British Major John André carrying papers that revealed the plot. Upon learning of André's capture, Arnold fled down the Hudson River to the British ship "HMS Vulture". He was almost captured by the forces of George Washington, who had been alerted to the plot.
Arnold got a commission as a brigadier general in the British Army, an annual pension of £360, and a lump sum of over £6,000. He led British forces on raids in Virginia, and against New London and Groton, Connecticut, before the war effectively ended with the American victory at Yorktown. In the winter of 1782, Arnold moved to London with his second wife, Margaret "Peggy" Shippen Arnold. He was well received by King George III and the Tories but frowned upon by the Whigs. In 1787, he entered into mercantile business with his sons Richard and Henry in Saint John, New Brunswick, but returned to London to settle permanently in 1791, where he died ten years later.
Because of the way he changed sides, his name quickly became a byword in the United States for treason or betrayal. His conflicting legacy is recalled in the ambiguous nature of some of the memorials that have been placed in his honor.
Benedict was born the second of six children to Benedict Arnold III (1683–1761) and Hannah Waterman King in Norwich, Connecticut, on January 14, 1741. He was named after his great-grandfather Benedict Arnold, an early governor of the Colony of Rhode Island, and his brother Benedict IV, who died in infancy. Only Benedict and his sister Hannah survived to adulthood; his other brothers and sisters died of yellow fever in childhood. Through his maternal grandmother, Arnold was a descendant of John Lothropp, an ancestor of at least four U.S. presidents.
Arnold's father was a successful businessman, and the family moved in the upper levels of Norwich society. When he was ten, Arnold was sent to a private school in nearby Canterbury, and was expected to go to Yale. However, the deaths of his siblings two years later may have contributed to a decline in the family fortunes, since his father took up drinking. By the time he was fourteen, there was no money for private education. His father's alcoholism and ill health stopped him from training Arnold in the family business, but his mother's family connections secured an apprenticeship for Arnold with two of her cousins, brothers Daniel and Joshua Lathrop, who operated a successful apothecary and general merchandise trade in Norwich. His apprenticeship with the Lathrops lasted seven years.
In 1755, Arnold, attracted by the sound of a drummer, attempted to enlist in the provincial militia to fight in the French and Indian War, but his mother refused permission. In 1757, when he was sixteen, he did enlist in the militia, which marched off toward Albany and Lake George. The French had besieged Fort William Henry, and their Indian allies had committed atrocities after their victory. Word of the siege's disastrous outcome led the company to turn around; Arnold served for 13 days. Some say that Arnold deserted in 1758 but there is no proof.
Arnold's mother, to whom he was very close, died in 1759. His father's alcoholism worsened after the death of his wife, and the youth took on the responsibility of supporting his father and younger sister. His father was arrested on several occasions for public drunkenness, was refused communion by his church, and eventually died in 1761.
Helped by the Lathrops, Arnold set himself up as a pharmacist and bookseller in New Haven, Connecticut in 1762. 
Arnold was hardworking and successful, and was able to expand his business. In 1763 he repaid money borrowed from the Lathrops, bought back the family homestead that his father had sold when deeply in debt, and re-sold it a year later for a substantial profit. 
In 1764 he formed a partnership with Adam Babcock, another young New Haven merchant. Using the profits from the sale of his homestead they bought three trading ships and started trading with the West Indies. During this time he brought his sister Hannah to New Haven to manage the apothecary business when he was absent. He traveled a lot for his business, throughout New England and from Quebec to the West Indies, often in command of one of his own ships. On one of his voyages, Arnold fought a duel in Honduras with a British sea captain who had called him a "damned Yankee, destitute of good manners or those of a gentleman". The captain was wounded after the first exchange of gunfire, and apologized after Arnold threatened to aim to kill on the second.
The Sugar Act of 1764 and the Stamp Act of 1765 limited trade in the colonies. The latter act prompted Arnold to join the opposition to those taxes, and also led him to join the Sons of Liberty, a secret organization that was not afraid to use violence to oppose those and other unpopular Parliamentary measures. At first Arnold took no part in any public demonstrations but, like many merchants, continued to trade as if the Stamp Act did not exist. This meant he was a smuggler in defiance of the act. Arnold also faced financial ruin. He owed £16,000 and some creditors spread rumors that he was bankrupt. He took legal action against them. 
On the night of 28 January 1767, Arnold and members of his crew, watched by a crowd of Sons, roughed up a man suspected of attempting to inform authorities of Arnold's smuggling. Arnold was convicted of a disorderly conduct charge and fined the relatively small amount of 50 shillings; publicity of the case and widespread sympathy for his view probably contributed to the light sentence.
On 22 February 1767, he married Margaret Mansfield, daughter of Samuel Mansfield, the sheriff of New Haven, an acquaintance that may have been made through the membership of both Mansfield and Arnold in the local Masonic Lodge. Their first son, Benedict VI, was born the following year, and was followed by brothers Richard in 1769, and Henry in 1772. Margaret died early in the revolution, on 19 June 1775, while Arnold was still at Fort Ticonderoga. The household, even while she lived, was dominated by Arnold's sister Hannah. Arnold benefited from his relationship with Mansfield, who became a partner in his business and used his position as sheriff to shield Arnold from creditors.
Arnold was in the West Indies when the Boston Massacre took place on 5 March 1770. He wrote he was "very much shocked" and wondered "good God, are the Americans all asleep and tamely giving up their liberties, or are they all turned philosophers, that they don't take immediate vengeance on such miscreants".
Arnold began the war when he was elected as a captain in Connecticut's militia in March 1775. After the start of fighting at Lexington and Concord the following month, his company marched northeast to help at the siege of Boston that followed. Arnold told the Massachusetts Committee of Safety of his idea to seize Fort Ticonderoga in New York, which he knew was poorly defended. They made him a colonel on 3 May 1775, and he immediately rode off to the west, arriving at Castleton in the disputed New Hampshire Grants (present-day Vermont) in time to join with Ethan Allen and his men in the capture of Fort Ticonderoga. He followed up that action with a bold raid on Fort Saint-Jean on the Richelieu River north of Lake Champlain. When a Connecticut militia force arrived at Ticonderoga in June, he had a dispute with its commander over control of the fort, and resigned his Massachusetts commission. He was on his way home from Ticonderoga when he learned that his wife died earlier in June.
When the Second Continental Congress authorized an invasion of Quebec, in part on the urging of Arnold, he was passed over for command of the expedition. Arnold then went to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and suggested to George Washington a second expedition to attack Quebec City via a wilderness route through present-day Maine. This expedition, for which Arnold received a colonel's commission in the Continental Army, left Cambridge in September 1775 with 1,100 men. After a difficult passage in which 300 men turned back and another 200 died en route, Arnold arrived before Quebec City in November. Joined by Richard Montgomery's small army, he took part in the assault on Quebec City on 31 December, in which Montgomery was killed and Arnold's leg was shattered. Rev. Samuel Spring, his chaplain, carried him to the makeshift hospital at the Hotel Dieu. Arnold, who was promoted to brigadier general for his role in reaching Quebec, maintained an ineffectual siege of the city until he was replaced by Major General David Wooster in April 1776. 
Arnold then traveled to Montreal, where he served as military commander of the city until forced to retreat by an advancing British army that had arrived at Quebec in May. He commanded the rear of the Continental Army during its retreat from Saint-Jean. James Wilkinson said Arnold was the last person to leave before the British arrived. He then directed the construction of a fleet to defend Lake Champlain, which was defeated in the October 1776 Battle of Valcour Island. His actions at Saint-Jean and Valcour Island played a notable role in delaying the British advance against Ticonderoga until 1777.
During these actions, Arnold made a number of friends and a larger number of enemies within the army power structure and in Congress. He had established decent relationships with George Washington, commander of the army, as well as Philip Schuyler and Horatio Gates, both of whom had command of the army's Northern Department during 1775 and 1776. However, a dispute with Moses Hazen, commander of the 2nd Canadian Regiment, boiled over into a court martial of Hazen at Ticonderoga during the summer of 1776. Only action by Gates, then his superior at Ticonderoga, prevented his own arrest on counter charges leveled by Hazen. He had also had disagreements with John Brown and James Easton, two lower-level officers with political connections that resulted in ongoing suggestions of wrongdoing on his part. Brown was particularly vicious, publishing a handbill that claimed of Arnold, "Money is this man's God, and to get enough of it he would sacrifice his country".
General Washington sent Arnold to the defend Rhode Island after the British seized Newport in December 1776, where the militia was too poorly equipped to even consider an attack on the British. Arnold was near his home, so he took the opportunity to visit his children, and he spent much of the winter socializing in Boston, where he unsuccessfully courted a young belle named Betsy Deblois. In February 1777, he learned that he had been passed over for promotion to major general by Congress. Washington refused his offer to resign, and wrote to members of Congress in an attempt to correct this, noting that "two or three other very good officers" might be lost if they persisted in making politically-motivated promotions. Arnold was on his way to Philadelphia to discuss his future when he was alerted that a British force was marching toward a supply depot in Danbury, Connecticut. Along with David Wooster and Connecticut militia General Gold Selleck Silliman he organized the militia response. In the Battle of Ridgefield, he led a small contingent of militia attempting to stop or slow the British return to the coast, and was again wounded in his left leg. Arnold went on to Philadelphia, where he met with members of Congress about his rank. His action at Ridgefield, coupled with the death of Wooster due to wounds sustained in the action, resulted in Arnold's promotion to major general, although his seniority was not restored over those who had been promoted before him. Amid negotiations over that issue, Arnold wrote out a letter of resignation on 11 July the same day word arrived in Philadelphia that Fort Ticonderoga had fallen to the British. Washington refused his resignation and ordered him north to assist with the defense there.
Arnold arrived in Schuyler's camp at Fort Edward, New York on 24 July. On 13 August Schuyler dispatched him with a force of 900 to relieve the siege of Fort Stanwix, where he used a trick to end the siege. Arnold had an Indian messenger sent into the camp of British Brigadier General Barry St. Leger with news that the approaching force was much larger and closer than it actually was; this convinced St. Leger's Indian support to abandon him, forcing him to give up the effort.
Arnold then returned to the Hudson, where General Gates had taken over command of the American army, which had by then retreated to a camp south of Stillwater. He then distinguished himself in both Battles of Saratoga, even though General Gates, following a series of escalating disagreements and disputes that culminated in a shouting match, removed him from field command after the first battle. During the fighting in the second battle, Arnold, against Gates' orders, took to the battlefield and led attacks on the British defenses. He was again severely wounded in the left leg late in the fighting. Arnold himself said it would have been better had it been in the chest instead of the leg. Burgoyne surrendered ten days after the second battle, on 17 October 1777. In response to Arnold's valor at Saratoga, Congress restored his command seniority. However, Arnold interpreted the manner in which they did so as an act of sympathy for his wounds, and not an apology or recognition that they were righting a wrong.
Arnold spent several months recovering from his injuries. Rather than amputating his shattered left leg, he had it crudely set, leaving it shorter than the right. He returned to the army at Valley Forge in May 1778 to the applause of men who had served under him at Saratoga. There he took part in the first recorded Oath of Allegiance along with many other soldiers, as a sign of loyalty to the United States.
, Philadelphia. Arnold made the Masters-Penn mansion, as it was then called, his headquarters while military commander of Philadelphia. It later served as the presidential mansion of George Washington and John Adams, 1790–1800.
After the British withdrew from Philadelphia in June 1778 Washington appointed Arnold military commander of the city. Even before the Americans reoccupied Philadelphia, Arnold began planning to capitalize financially on the change in power there, engaging in a variety of business deals designed to profit from war-related supply movements and benefiting from the protection of his authority. These schemes were sometimes frustrated by powerful local politicians, who eventually amassed enough evidence to publicly air charges. Arnold demanded a court martial to clear the charges, writing to Washington in May 1779, "Having become a cripple in the service of my country, I little expected to meet [such] ungrateful returns".
Arnold lived extravagantly in Philadelphia, and was a prominent figure on the social scene. During the summer of 1778 Arnold met Peggy Shippen, the 18-year-old daughter of Judge Edward Shippen, a Loyalist sympathizer who had done business with the British while they occupied the city. Peggy had been courted by British Major John André during the British occupation of Philadelphia. Peggy and Arnold married on 8 April 1779. Peggy and her circle of friends had found methods of staying in contact with paramours across the battle lines, in spite of military bans on communication with the enemy. Some of this communication was effected through the services of Joseph Stansbury, a Philadelphia merchant.
Sometime early in May 1779, Arnold met with Stansbury. Stansbury, whose testimony before a British commission apparently erroneously placed the date in June, said that, after meeting with Arnold, "I went secretly to New York with a tender of [Arnold's] services to Sir Henry Clinton." Ignoring instructions from Arnold not to involve anyone else in the plot, Stansbury crossed the British lines and went to see Jonathan Odell in New York. Odell was a Loyalist working with William Franklin, the last Colonial Governor of New Jersey and the son of Benjamin Franklin. On 9 May Franklin introduced Stansbury to Major André, who had just been named the British spy chief. This was the beginning of a secret correspondence between Arnold and André, sometimes using his wife Peggy as a willing intermediary, that culminated over a year later with Arnold's change of sides.
André spoke to General Clinton, who gave him broad authority to pursue Arnold's offer. André then drafted instructions to Stansbury and Arnold. This first letter opened a discussion on the types of assistance and intelligence Arnold might provide, and included instructions for how to communicate in the future. Letters would be passed through the women's circle that Peggy Arnold was a part of, but only Peggy would be aware that some letters contained instructions written in both code "and" invisible ink that were to be passed on to André, using Stansbury as the courier.
By July 1779, Arnold was providing the British with troop locations and strengths, as well as the locations of supply depots, all the while negotiating over compensation. At first, he asked for indemnification of his losses and £10,000, an amount the Continental Congress had given Charles Lee for his services in the Continental Army. General Clinton, who was pursuing a campaign to gain control of the Hudson River Valley, was interested in plans and information on the defenses of West Point and other defenses on the Hudson River. He also began to insist on a face-to-face meeting, and suggested to Arnold that he pursue another high-level command. By October 1779, the negotiations had ground to a halt. Furthermore, Patriot mobs were scouring Philadelphia for Loyalists, and Arnold and the Shippen family were being threatened. Arnold was rebuffed by Congress and by local authorities in requests for security details for himself and his in-laws.
The court martial to consider the charges against Arnold began meeting on 1 June 1779, but was delayed until December 1779 by General Clinton's capture of Stony Point, New York, throwing the army into a flurry of activity to react. In spite of the fact that a number of members of the panel of judges were men ill-disposed to Arnold over actions and disputes earlier in the war, Arnold was cleared of all but two minor charges on 26 January 1780. Arnold worked over the next few months to publicize this fact; however, in early April, just one week after Washington congratulated Arnold on the 19 May birth of his son, Edward Shippen Arnold, Washington published a formal rebuke of Arnold's behavior.
Shortly after Washington's rebuke, a Congressional inquiry into his expenditures concluded that Arnold had failed to fully account for his expenditures incurred during the Quebec invasion, and that he owed the Congress some £1,000, largely because he was unable to document them. A significant number of these documents were lost during the retreat from Quebec; angry and frustrated, Arnold resigned his military command of Philadelphia in late April.
Early in April, Philip Schuyler had approached Arnold with the possibility of giving him the command at West Point. Discussions between Schuyler and Washington on the subject had not borne fruit by early June. Arnold reopened the secret channels with the British, informing them of Schuyler's proposals and including Schuyler's assessment of conditions and West Point. He also provided information on a proposed French-American invasion of Quebec that was to go up the Connecticut River. (Arnold did not know that this proposed invasion was a ruse intended to divert British resources.) On 16 June Arnold inspected West Point while on his way home to Connecticut to take care of personal business, and sent a highly detailed report through the secret channel. When he reached Connecticut Arnold arranged to sell his home there, and began transferring assets to London through intermediaries in New York. By early July he was back in Philadelphia, where he wrote another secret message to Clinton on 7 July which implied that his appointment to West Point was assured and that he might even provide a "drawing of the works ... by which you might take [West Point] without loss".
General Clinton and Major André, who returned victorious from the Siege of Charleston on 18 June were immediately caught up in this news. Clinton, concerned that Washington's army and the French fleet would join in Rhode Island, again fixed on West Point as a strategic point to capture. André, who had spies and informers keeping track of Arnold, verified his movements. Excited by the prospects, Clinton informed his superiors of his intelligence coups, but failed to respond to Arnold's 7 July letter.
Arnold next wrote a series of letters to Clinton, even before he might have expected a response to the 7 July letter. In a letter of 11 July, he complained that the British did not appear to trust him, and threatened to break off negotiations unless progress was made. On 12 July he wrote again, making explicit the offer to surrender West Point, although his price (in addition to indemnification for his losses) rose to £20,000, with a £1,000 down payment to be delivered with the response. These letters were delivered not by Stansbury but by Samuel Wallis, another Philadelphia businessman who spied for the British.
On 3 August 1780, Arnold obtained command of West Point. On 15 August he received a coded letter from André with Clinton's final offer: £20,000, and no indemnification for his losses. Due to difficulties in getting the messages across the lines, neither side knew for some days that the other was in agreement to that offer. Arnold's letters continued to detail Washington's troop movements and provide information about French reinforcements that were being organized. On 25 August Peggy finally delivered to him Clinton's agreement to the terms.
Washington, in assigning Arnold to the command at West Point, also gave him authority over the entire American-controlled Hudson River, from Albany down to the British lines outside New York City. While en route to West Point, Arnold renewed an acquaintance with Joshua Hett Smith, someone Arnold knew had done spy work for both sides, and who owned a house near the western bank of the Hudson just south of West Point.
Once he established himself at West Point, Arnold began systematically weakening its defenses and military strength. Needed repairs on the chain across the Hudson were never ordered. Troops were liberally distributed within Arnold's command area (but only minimally at West Point itself), or furnished to Washington on request. He also peppered Washington with complaints about the lack of supplies, writing, "Everything is wanting". At the same time, he tried to drain West Point's supplies, so that a siege would be more likely to succeed. His subordinates, some of whom were long-time associates, grumbled about unnecessary distribution of supplies, and eventually concluded that Arnold was selling some of the supplies on the black market for personal gain.
On 30 August 30, Arnold sent a letter accepting Clinton's terms and proposing a meeting to André through yet another intermediary: William Heron, a member of the Connecticut Assembly he thought he could trust. Heron, in a comic twist, went into New York unaware of the significance of the letter, and offered his own services to the British as a spy. He then took the letter back to Connecticut, where, suspicious of Arnold's actions, he delivered it to the head of the Connecticut militia. General Parsons, seeing a letter written as a coded business discussion, laid it aside. Four days later, Arnold sent a ciphered letter with similar content into New York through the services of a prisoner-of-war's wife. Eventually, a meeting was set for 11 September near Dobb's Ferry. This meeting was thwarted when British gunboats in the river, not having been informed of his impending arrival, fired on his boat.
Arnold and André finally met on 21 September at Joshua Hett Smith's house. On the morning of 22 September James Livingston, the colonel in charge of the outpost at Verplanck's Point, fired on HMS "Vulture", the ship that was intended to carry André back to New York. This action damaged the ship and she had to retreat downriver, forcing André to return to New York overland. Arnold wrote out passes for André so that he would be able to pass through the lines, and also gave him plans for West Point. On Saturday, 23 September André was captured, near Tarrytown, by three Westchester patriots named John Paulding, Isaac Van Wart and David Williams; the papers exposing the plot to capture West Point were found and sent to Washington, and Arnold's treachery came to light after Washington examined them. Meanwhile, André convinced the unsuspecting commanding officer to whom he was delivered, Colonel John Jameson, to send him back to Arnold at West Point. However, Major Benjamin Tallmadge, a member of Washington's secret service, insisted Jameson order the prisoner intercepted and brought back. Jameson reluctantly recalled the lieutenant delivering André into Arnold's custody, but then sent the same lieutenant as a messenger to notify Arnold of André's arrest.
Arnold learned of André's capture the following morning, 24 September, when he received Jameson's message that André was in his custody and that the papers André was carrying had been sent to General Washington. Arnold received Jameson's letter while waiting for Washington, with whom he had planned to have breakfast. He made all haste to the shore and ordered bargemen to row him downriver to where the "Vulture" was anchored, which then took him to New York. From the ship Arnold wrote a letter to Washington, requesting that Peggy be given safe passage to her family in Philadelphia, a request Washington granted. When presented with evidence of Arnold's betrayal, it is reported that Washington was calm. He did, however, investigate the extent of the betrayal, and suggested in negotiations with General Clinton over the fate of Major André that he was willing to exchange André for Arnold. This suggestion Clinton refused; after a military tribunal, André was hanged at Tappan, New York on 2 October. Washington also infiltrated men into New York in an attempt to kidnap Arnold; this plan, which very nearly succeeded, failed when Arnold changed living quarters prior to sailing for Virginia in December.
Arnold attempted to justify his actions in an open letter titled "To the Inhabitants of America", published in newspapers in October 1780. In the letter to Washington requesting safe passage for Peggy, he wrote that "Love to my country actuates my present conduct, however it may appear inconsistent to the world, who very seldom judge right of any man's actions."
The British gave Arnold a brigadier general's commission with an annual income of several hundred pounds, but only paid him £6,315 plus an annual pension of £360 because his plot failed. In December 1780, under orders from Clinton, Arnold led a force of 1,600 troops into Virginia, where he captured Richmond by surprise and then went on a rampage through Virginia, destroying supply houses, foundries, and mills. This activity brought Virginia's militia out, and Arnold eventually retreated to Portsmouth to either be evacuated or reinforced. The pursuing American army included the Marquis de Lafayette, who was under orders from Washington to summarily hang Arnold if he was captured. Reinforcements led by William Phillips (who served under Burgoyne at Saratoga) arrived in late March, and Phillips led further raids across Virginia, including a defeat of Baron von Steuben at Petersburg, until his death of fever on 12 May 1781. Arnold commanded the army only until 20 May when Lord Cornwallis arrived with the southern army and took over. One colonel wrote to Clinton of Arnold, "there are many officers who must wish some other general in command". Cornwallis ignored advice proffered by Arnold to locate a permanent base away from the coast that might have averted his later surrender at Yorktown.
On his return to New York in June, Arnold made a variety of proposals for continuing to attack essentially economic targets in order to force the Americans to end the war. Clinton, however, was not interested in most of Arnold's aggressive ideas, but finally relented and authorized Arnold to raid the port of New London, Connecticut. On 4 September not long after the birth of his and Peggy's second son, Arnold's force of over 1,700 men raided and burned New London and captured Fort Griswold, causing damage estimated at $500,000. British casualties were high—nearly one quarter of the force was killed or wounded, a rate at which Clinton claimed he could ill afford more such victories.
Even before Cornwallis's surrender in October, Arnold had requested permission from Clinton to go to England to give Lord Germain his thoughts on the war in person. When word of the surrender reached New York, Arnold renewed the request, which Clinton then granted. On 8 December 1781, Arnold and his family left New York for England. In London he aligned himself with the Tories, advising Germain and King George III to renew the fight against the Americans. In the House of Commons, Edmund Burke expressed the hope that the government would not put Arnold "at the head of a part of a British army" lest "the sentiments of true honor, which every British officer [holds] dearer than life, should be afflicted." To Arnold's detriment the anti-war Whigs had gotten the upper hand in Parliament, and Germain was forced to resign, with the government of Lord North falling not long after.
Arnold then applied to accompany General Carleton, who was going to New York to replace Clinton as commander-in-chief; this request went nowhere. Other attempts to gain positions within the government or the British East India Company over the next few years all failed, and he was forced to subsist on the reduced pay of non-wartime service. His reputation also came under criticism in the British press, especially when compared to that of Major André, who was celebrated for his patriotism. One particularly harsh critic said that he was a "mean mercenary, who, having adopted a cause for the sake of plunder, quits it when convicted of that charge." In turning him down for an East India Company posting, George Johnstone wrote, "Although I am satisfied with the purity of your conduct, the generality do not think so. While this is the case, no power in this country could suddenly place you in the situation you aim at under the East India Company."
In 1785 Arnold and his son Richard moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, where they speculated in land, and established a business doing trade with the West Indies. Arnold purchased large tracts of land in the Maugerville area, and acquired city lots in Saint John and Fredericton. Delivery of his first ship, the "Lord Sheffield", was accompanied by accusations from the builder that Arnold had cheated him; Arnold claimed that he had merely deducted the contractually agreed amount when the ship was delivered late. After her first voyage, Arnold returned to London in 1786 to bring his family to Saint John. While there he disentangled himself from a lawsuit over an unpaid debt that Peggy had been fighting while he was away, paying £900 to settle a £12,000 loan he had taken while living in Philadelphia. The family moved to Saint John in 1787, where Arnold created an uproar with a series of bad business deals and petty lawsuits. Following the most serious, a slander suit he won against a former business partner, townspeople burned him in effigy in front of his house as Peggy and the children watched. The family left Saint John to return to London in December 1791.
In July 1792 he fought a bloodless duel with the James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale after the Earl impugned his honor in the House of Lords. With the outbreak of the French Revolution Arnold outfitted a privateer, while continuing to do business in the West Indies, even though the hostilities increased the risk. He was imprisoned by French authorities on Guadeloupe amid accusations of spying for the British, and narrowly eluded hanging by escaping to the blockading British fleet after bribing his guards. He helped organize militia forces on British-held islands, receiving praise from the landowners for his efforts on their behalf. This work, which he hoped would earn him wider respect and a new command, instead earned him and his sons a land grant of in Upper Canada, near present-day Renfrew, Ontario.
In January 1801 Arnold's health began to decline. Gout, which he had suffered since 1775, attacked his unwounded leg to the point where he was unable to go to sea; the other ached constantly, and he walked only with a cane. His doctors diagnosed him as having dropsy, and a visit to the countryside only temporarily improved his condition. He died after four days of delirium, on 14 June 1801, at the age of 60. Legend has it that when he was on his deathbed he said, "Let me die in this old uniform in which I fought my battles. May God forgive me for ever having put on another," but this may be apocryphal. Arnold was buried at St. Mary's Church, Battersea in London, England. As a result of a clerical error in the parish records, his remains were removed to an unmarked mass grave during church renovations a century later. His funeral procession had "seven mourning coaches and four state carriages"; the funeral was without military honors.
He left a small estate, reduced in size by his debts, which Peggy undertook to clear. Among his bequests were considerable gifts to one John Sage, who turned out to be an illegitimate son conceived during his time in New Brunswick.
Arnold's contributions to American independence are largely underrepresented in popular culture, while his name became synonymous with traitor in the 19th century. The demonization of Arnold began immediately after his betrayal became public. Biblical themes were often invoked; Benjamin Franklin wrote that "Judas Iscariot sold only one man, Arnold three million", and Alexander Scammel described Arnold's actions as "black as hell".
Early biographers attempted to describe Arnold's entire life in terms of treacherous or morally questionable behavior. The first major biography of Arnold, "The Life and Treason of Benedict Arnold", published in 1832 by historian Jared Sparks, was particularly harsh in showing how Arnold's treacherous character was allegedly formed out of childhood experiences. George Canning Hill, who authored a series of moralistic biographies in the mid-19th century, began his 1865 biography of Arnold "Benedict, the Traitor, was born ...". Social historian Brian Carso notes that as the 19th century progressed, the story of Arnold's betrayal took on near-mythic proportions as a part of the national creation story, and was again invoked as sectional conflicts leading up the American Civil War increased. Washington Irving used it as part of an argument against dismemberment of the union in his 1857 "Life of George Washington", pointing out that only the unity of New England and the southern states that led to independence was made possible in part by holding West Point. Jefferson Davis and other southern secessionist leaders were unfavorably compared to Arnold, implicitly and explicitly likening the idea of secession to treason. "Harper's Weekly" published an article in 1861 describing Confederate leaders as "a few men directing this colossal treason, by whose side Benedict Arnold shines white as a saint."
Fictional invocations of Arnold's name also carried strongly negative overtones. A moralistic children's tale entitled "The Cruel Boy" was widely circulated in the 19th century. It described a boy who stole eggs from birds' nests, pulled wings off insects, and engaged in other sorts of wanton cruelty, who then grew up to become a traitor to his country. The boy is not identified until the end of the story, when his place of birth is given as Norwich, Connecticut, and his name is given as Benedict Arnold. However, not all depictions of Arnold were strongly negative. Some theatrical treatments of the 19th century explored his duplicity, seeking to understand rather than demonize it.
The connection between Arnold and treason continued into the 20th and 21st centuries. On an episode of The Brady Bunch, "Everyone Can't Be George Washington", after Peter is assigned the role of Arnold in the school play, everyone hates him. A line by the comically insincere character Sir in the 1965 Broadway musical "The Roar of the Greasepaint – The Smell of the Crowd", who often declares his integrity with references to entirely untrustworthy individuals which his foil Cocky does not understand, declares, "God knows I'm not perfect, Cocky, but by the unswerving loyalties of Benedict Arnold, I do believe in forgiving a friend." In a recent reference, Dan Gilbert, owner of the National Basketball Association's Cleveland Cavaliers, subtly invoked Arnold in 2010. Upset over the manner in which LeBron James announced his departure from the team, Gilbert's company lowered the price of posters bearing James's likeness to $17.41, referring to the year of Arnold's birth.
Novelistic treatments of the American Revolutionary war sometimes feature Arnold as a character. His Judas-role in popular imagination is so fixed though that even an iconoclastic novel sequence like Gore Vidal's "Narratives of Empire" does not question it. But one notable treatment, depicting Arnold very much in a positive light, is Kenneth Roberts' Arundel novels, which cover many of the campaigns in which he participated:
During his marriage to Margaret Mansfield, Arnold had the following children:
and with Peggy Shippen, he raised a family active in British military service:
On the battlefield at Saratoga, now preserved in Saratoga National Historical Park, stands a monument in memorial to Arnold, but there is no mention of his name on the engraving. Donated by Civil War General John Watts DePeyster, the inscription on the Boot Monument reads: "In memory of the most brilliant soldier of the Continental army, who was desperately wounded on this spot, winning for his countrymen the decisive battle of the American Revolution, and for himself the rank of Major General." The victory monument at Saratoga has four niches, three of which are occupied by statues of Generals Gates, Schuyler, and Morgan. The fourth niche is empty.
On the grounds of the United States Military Academy at West Point there are plaques commemorating all of the generals that served in the Revolution. One plaque bears only a rank, "major general" and a date, "born 1740", and no name.
The house at 62 Gloucester Place where Arnold lived in central London still stands, bearing a plaque that describes Arnold as an "American Patriot". The church where Arnold was buried, St. Mary's Church, Battersea, England, has a commemorative stained-glass window which was added between 1976 and 1982. The faculty club at the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, has a Benedict Arnold Room, in which framed original letters written by Arnold hang on the walls.

Fasciola hepatica

Fasciola hepatica is the common liver fluke. It is a parasitic trematode (fluke or flatworm) in the phylum Platyhelminthes.
It infects the livers of various mammals, including humans. The disease caused by the fluke is called "fascioliasis". It has been classified as a neglected tropical disease. 
"F. hepatica" is distributed worldwide, and has been known as an important parasite of sheep and cattle for hundreds of years. It causes great economic losses in sheep and cattle. Because of its size and economic importance, it has been the subject of many scientific investigations and may be the best-known of any trematode species.
To complete its life cycle, "F. hepatica" needs a freshwater snail as an intermediate host, where the parasite can reproduce asexually.

List of bus routes in London

This page is a list of Transport for London (TfL) contracted London Bus routes in London, as well as private services that enter the Greater London area (except coaches).
Historically, bus routes run by London Transport were grouped by the type of service that they provided.
The 1924 London Traffic Act imposed a numbering scheme known as the Bassom Scheme, named after Chief Constable A.E. Bassom of the Metropolitan Police who made it. Changing and short lines used letter suffixes. The numbers were grouped also by the company that operated the route.
The numbering was revised in 1934 after London Transport was formed:
All routes operate in both directions unless detailed.
The majority of routes in this sequence are run for schools to reduce overcrowding on regular bus services. Their timetables are subject to short notice alteration and re-routing in accordance with school requirements. A notable exception is route 607, which is a limited stop service operating in West London, whose number is "inherited" from the period (15 November 1936 – 8 November 1960), when this route was served by trolleybuses.
These are Mobility Bus Routes. These routes provide a once a week return journey to a local shopping centre where there is no alternative route in the main bus network. The prevalence of low-floor buses across London has reduced somewhat the number of Mobility Bus services.
Night bus routes are often related to the day numerical equivalent, normally running the same route but with an extension at either end of the service. This is normally to provide a night service to destinations served by tube or train during the day.
However, in a few cases, services have a route number that has no relation to its daytime equivalent, such as the N5, which operates in a different part of London to the day route 5.
There are also 24-hour routes. Route 65 is classed as a 24-hour service, but unusually has an extension to its night service, rather than the night service being designated N65.
These bus routes are operated with a "London Service Permit" issued by Transport for London, and are generally routes from towns just outside the Greater London boundary to destinations within. The exceptions are the 812, MB1 and 938, which run entirely within the boundary. Another exception is the 724, which although run by a coach company, it is a bus route.
Coach services are not included in this list.
This list shows some old routes that used to operate but do not exist anymore.

Levenshtein distance

Levenshtein Distance is a way to calculate how different two words are from one another.
The simple way this works is by counting how many times you need to change one word to turn it into another word.
For example, the Levenshtein distance between "kitten" and "sitting" is 3, since the following three edits change one into the other, and there is no way to do it with fewer than three edits:
This can be used by various websites when you change your password to make sure you're not using a similar password that can decrease the security of the website. The given minimum distance between two passwords is recommended to be 5, so that means that 5 changes need to take place between your old password and your new password for certain websites to accept your new password.

It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings

It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings is an English expression with a meaning similar to "Don't count your chickens before they hatch." It is commonly used in sports journalism, most famously by Dan Cook. This happened in April 1978 after the first game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Washington Bullets (later renamed the Washington Wizards) during the National Basketball Association playoffs. The Spurs had won the first game, but he pointed out that the series was not over yet, saying, "The opera ain't over till the fat lady sings." (The Bullets won the series, and later the NBA title).
The "fat lady" means the fat Norwegian "Brünnhilde," singing the final tragic song, wearing a Viking helmet. It can also refer to any female opera singer in general. The saying also means that "it's all over" when the fat lady sings.

Fukushima nuclear disaster

The Fukushima nuclear disaster is a series of ongoing equipment failures, reactor meltdowns, and releases of radioactive materials at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, following the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011. The plant has six separate Nuclear reactors maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). The accident is the second biggest nuclear accident after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, but more complex as all reactors are involved.
At the time of the quake, reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. The remaining reactors shut down automatically after the earthquake, but the entire plant was flooded, including low-lying generators and electrical switchgear in reactor basements and external pumps for supplying cooling seawater. The connection to the electrical grid was broken. All power for cooling was lost and reactors started to overheat. There was a partial core meltdown in reactors 1, 2, and 3; hydrogen explosions destroyed the upper part of the buildings housing reactors 1, 3, and 4; an explosion damaged the containment inside reactor 2; fires broke out at reactor 4. Despite being initially shutdown, reactors 5 and 6 began to overheat. Spent nuclear fuel rods stored in pools in each reactor building overheated as water levels in the pools dropped.
Fears of radiation leaks led to a 20 km (12 mi) radius evacuation around the plant while workers suffered radiation exposure and were temporarily moved out at various times. Grid power was restored to parts of the plant on 20 March, but machinery for reactors 1 through 4, damaged by floods, fires and explosions, was still not working. Flooding with radioactive water through the basements of units 1–4 continues to prevent access to carry out repairs. Measurements in areas of northern Japan 30–50 km from the plant showed radioactive caesium levels high enough to cause concern. Food grown in the area was banned from sale. It was suggested that worldwide measurements of iodine-131 and caesium-137 indicate that the releases from Fukushima are of the same order of magnitude as the releases of those isotopes from the Chernobyl disaster in 1986;
Tokyo officials said that tap water should not be used to prepare food for children. Plutonium contamination has been detected in the soil at two sites in the plant. Two workers hospitalized as a precaution on 25 March had been exposed to between 2000 and 6000 mSv of radiation at their ankles when standing in water in unit 3. Radiation levels varied widely over time and location.
The nuclear emergencies at Japan's Fukushima I and other nuclear facilities raised questions about the future of nuclear power. Platts, an energy news website, said that "the crisis at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy-consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world". Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035.

Robert Cormier

Robert Edmund Cormier (January 17, 1925 – November 2, 2000) was an American author, columnist, and reporter. His literature include negative feelings and ideas. His most popular books include "I Am the Cheese", "After the First Death", "We All Fall Down" and "The Chocolate War". All of those novels won awards. Many people tried to keep his first book, "The Chocolate War" out of libraries because they thought it was bad for children. His books often show abuse, mental illness, violence, revenge, betrayal and conspiracy. In most of his novels, the good characters fail.
Robert Cormier was born in Leominster, Massachusetts, United States, in the French-Canadian part of the town called French Hill. His parents were Geoffrey Leonard and Irma Cormier. Robert was the second of eight children. His family moved often to so they could pay their rent. However, they never left Leominster. Even when Robert was older, he stayed nearby. He owned a summer home 19 miles away from his hometown. Cormier studied at St. Cecilia's Parochial School. It was a private Catholic school. He began writing when he was in the first grade. He was praised at school for his poetry. He first decided to become a writer in 7th grade. He was encouraged by a nun to write a poem. He went Leominster High School and graduated as the president of his class. As a freshman at Fitchburg State College, he had his first short story published. A college professor, Florence Conlon, sent one of his stories to a national Catholic magazine called "The Sign". She did not Cormier before she sent the story to the magazine. He was paid $75. Cormier early work was writing advertisements for radio. Later, he became an award-winning journalist. Even though he became widely known, he never stopped writing for his local newspaper, the "Fitchburg Sentinel".
Cormier became a full-time writer after his first novel for teenagers, "The Chocolate War", became successful. Then he wrote other books such as "I Am the Cheese" and "After the First Death". He thought young people in modern society experienced many problems. He put his thoughts and worries into his novels. Soon he became known as a very good writer. Cormier would not change his way of thinking to please other people. He won the Margaret A. Edwards Award from the Young Adult Services Division of the American Library Association. This award is for writers who give young adults a new way to see the world understand their place in society.
ICormier used real places in some of his books. His hometown, Leominster, became the town of Monument in the story. The real place French Hill became Frenchtown.
People have tried to ban "The Chocolate War" and keep it out of schools and libraries. They did not want children to read the book because it described sexual activity and used adult language. The book also described secret societies and students breaking rules. The book was challenged many times between 1990 and 2000. According to the American Library Association only three other books were challenged more often during that time.

Macquarie River

The Macquarie River is one of the main inland rivers in New South Wales. It begins in the central highlands of New South Wales near the town of Oberon. The river flows northwest past the towns of Bathurst, Wellington, Dubbo, Narromine, and Warren to the Macquarie Marshes. The Macquarie Marshes then drain into the lower Barwon River and then into the Darling River
Burrendong Dam is a large dam (capacity 1,190,000 Megalitres) near Wellington which holds the waters of the Macquarie River and its tributaries the Cudgegong River and the Turon River to stop floods and provide water for irrigation. The dam made Lake Burrendong.
The Macquarie River flows for 626 kilometres and drops around 517 metres over its length. Lake Burrendong (346m) is the only dam on the river.
The Macquarie River starts at White Rock, near Oberon at an elevation of 671m.
Six rivers flow into the Macquarie River:
There are 19 creeks that flow into the Macquarie River:
The Macquarie system covers an area of more than 74,000 square kilometres. Over 72% of land is flat, and 17% is hilly. The rest is steep to mountainous, reaching 900 metres.
The east boundary is formed by the Great Dividing Range, from near Oberon in the south to Coolah in the north. A mountain ridge goes north-west from the Great Dividing Range for about 400 kilometres, then the boundary turns north.
From Bathurst, near the start of the river it passes the following geographic areas:
Rainfall varies across the area drained by the Macquarie River. The mountain the peaks and tablelands receive higher rainfall due to the shadowing effects of the surrounding ranges. The Great Dividing Range area receives between 750 to 900 mm annual median rainfall. This is falls evenly throughout the year. Gaps in the Dividing Range allows moist easterly air to pass inland, annual median rainfall of 750 mm or more is experienced further westward. Further north-west it is drier, in the Castelreagh and middle portions of the Macquarie valleys the annual median rainfall is 300 to 400 mm.
Rainfall can vary dramatically over several years. Records show that rainfall can be 200% or less than 50% of the average annual figure. Evaporation varies from less than 1000 mm south-east of Bathurst up to more than 2000 mm at Bourke.
The Wiradjuri people are the original people to live in the Macquarie River area. The Wiradjuri called the river "Wambool". The famous Wiradjuri warrior Windradyne came from the upper Macquarie River region. He was killed in a tribal battle alongside the river in 1829.
Near Carinda between the Macquarie River and Marra Creek, the oldest evidence of bread making in the world (about 30,000 years old) was found at an ancient lake known as Cuddie Springs.
The upper parts of the Macquarie River were first seen by Europeans in 1813. The river was named for the Governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie. In 1813 surveyor George Evans wrote in his journal:
"Tuesday, 30th November 1813." I have at length reached the Ridge I so much wished to do after walking about 2 Miles, where I had a prospect to the North for a great distance; A Mist arises from a part I suppose to be a River or a large Lagoon about 20 Miles Off;
"Thursday, 9th December 1813." I have called the Main Stream "Macquarie River".
In 1817-18 John Oxley followed the Lachlan and Macquarie Rivers. In 1828 Charles Sturt proved that Macquarie River ended in marshes. He discovered the Darling River
The Macquarie River area is a regulated Water Management Area and includes private irrigation as well as several public irrigation schemes
The Macquarie River has a history of flooding. After major floods water can flow past the Macquarie Marshes and into the Barwon-Darling river system upstream of Brewarrina.
Recreational activities are popular along the length of the river particularly in the communities it passes by.

Janemba

Janemba is the final villain in Dragon Ball Z, ending the series to bring forth Dragon Ball GT. He appears in the tenth and final movie of the series.
Janemba starts out as a very large, but incredible round blob.
When Goku hurts Janemba greatly, he reverts to a smaller, thinner, yet far more powerful form, Super Janemba. He has purple armor and red skin with a tail.
Janemba was originally an ogre for King Yemma, working at a machine that could bring back the dead. When the machine malfunctioned, the Ogre turned into Janemba. Meanwhile, the malfunctioning brought all the dead villains back to life on Earth, under Frieza's command. Hercule goes to deal with the zombies, while Goku and Pikkon go to deal with Janemba, who has trapped King Yemma inside his palace. Janemba, Goku, and Pikkon begin their fight in the Underworld. Goku is able to deal with Janemba after some battling, and the monster reverts into Super Janemba. Super Janemba's immense power level allows him to easily deal with Super Saiyan 3 Goku, Pikkon, and Vegeta, who had been given his body temporarily to help fight Janemba. Eventually, Goku and Vegeta fuse, but something goes wrong, and they become a very fat and weak fusion named Veku. King Kai blames the messed up fusion on Vegeta, because he did not stretch his index finger out. Veku propels himself away from Super Janemba for the next 30 minutes by farting. In those 30 minutes, Goten and Trunks fight a revived Hitler. They begin easily dealing with him and the Nazis, eventually beating him as Super Gotenks with a Super Kamikaze Ghost Attack. Just after, Hercule is doing a good job fending off the zombies, while Frieza taunts Gohan and Videl. He orders his men to attack the couple, but Gohan easily gets through them, and destroys Frieza with a Ki Blast and a punch to the gut at the same time. This makes all the remaining zombies retreat. Back in the Underworld, Goku and Vegeta unfuse, and try fusing again. This time, it is successful, and Super Gogeta was born. Super Gogeta made quick work of Super Janemba, and ultimately destroyed him.
Janemba made no other appearances after death.
Original- Janemba starts out as a large, yellow blob-like monster, and is also very fat. 
Super Janemba- Super Janemba is far smaller and thinner then his original form. He is now red, with a purple chestplate, a purple hat like object on his head, and more. He has yellow eyes.
Lightning Shower Rain- An attack that fires a short-ranged beam of energy. Used in the anime and can be used in Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2.
Super Explosive Cannon- An attack in which Super Janemba fires a powerful beam from his mouth. Is used on Pikkon in the anime in a combo, and can be used in Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2.
Instant Transmission- Super Janemba can also use Instant Transmission. Used in the anime and can be used on Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2.
Dimension Portal: Super Janemba can also create Dimension Portals, which allow him to move from place to place, as shown in the anime and Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2.
Dimension Sword Slice: Super Janemba slices his target repeatedly with his Dimension Sword, before teleporting in front of him/her and firing a Super Explosive Cannon.
Molecule Split: Super Janemba can split his molecules, making him seem to teleport. Janemba's dash in Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2.
Mini-forms: Janemba can create mini-versions of himself to attack.
Janemba makes his only appearance in the 12th, "Fusion Reborn." Because he is a Ssj7
Janemba cannot speak. In his original form, all he can say is his name, but as Super Janemba, all he makes are grunts and groans, similar to Kid Buu.

<doc id="294113" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=294113" title="Gas chromatography">
Gas chromatography

Gas chromatography is a type of chromatography. The sample to be tested is first turned into a gas, and then carried through a column by a nonreactive 'carrier' gas such as helium or other inert gas such as nitrogen. As the sample is carried through the column it is separated into its individual components. To achieve this the column is housed inside an oven, where the temperature is controlled to allow the individual components to exit the column at different times. 
In selecting a carrier gas it is important to select a gas that will not react with the components of the sample. The carrier gas should also be able to withstand high temperatures due to the oven. The flow rate of the carrier gas is important in that if it is too high there is not enough time for the sample to interact with the column and no separation will be seen, if it is too slow the experiment may take a very long time.
The main type of columns used in gas chromatography is a capillary column. Packed columns are created of fused silica or stainless steel. To increase separation of a gas sample columns must be created of a large length and are coiled to fit inside of the oven. Capillary columns are separated into two categories; wall coated open tubular and support coated open tubular. WCOT are capillary tubes with a thin layer of stationary phase, and in SCOT, the tube is lined with a thin film of support material. As the sample moves through the column the individual parts of the sample become contained with the material inside of the column and are then released. This action allows for a sample to become separated.
It is important that the oven is capable of maintaining a constant temperature. Since movement of the sample through the column relies on the boiling point of the sample being analyzed, the oven should be set to a temperature that is slightly higher than its boiling point. For samples with a large boiling range, a temperature program can be used, in which the column temperature is raised. By using a high temperature, the sample moves through the column faster, while at lower temperatures the sample moves slower, but better resolution is achieved.
Many types of detectors are used in gas chromatographic separations, with the most common are flame ionization, thermal conductivity, and mass spectrometry detectors. In a flame ionization detectors, the separated sample from the column is directed into a flame. By creating a voltage near the burner tip and the detector, the ions that are produced from the flame travel towards the detector. Flame detectors are not capable of detecting HO, CO, SO, and CO. 
With a thermal conductivity detector, the sample from the column is passed into an area that is electrically heated. The thermal conductivity of the column is reduced when the sample passes over by. When this occurs the detector heats up and measures the change in resistance. The thermal conductivity detector is capable of detecting all types of compounds.
A mass spectrometer measures the mass to charge ratio of fragmented ions of a sample. The output of a column can be feed directly into the ionization chamber of the mass spectrometer. A mass spectrometry detector is capable of being able to obtain information from incompletely separated components. Two types of mass spectrometer detectors used are quadrupole and time of flight mass analyzers. In a quadrupole detector, a voltage is produced which makes ions of a specific mass to travel to the detector. In a time of flight mass analyzer, the speed of an ion is measured allowing the mass to charge ratio to be known.
Gas chromatography is regularly used to describe what is inside a complex sample. The information obtained from gas chromatography is placed into a graph of detector response versus the time the sample leaves the column. If the separate parts of a complex sample come out at different times far apart from one another it is possible to determine what came out of the column.
If a sample is compared to a standard calibration it is possible to know how much of a separated part of the sample makes up the sample. This is useful in monitoring quality of a product such as medicine, beverage, or perfume.

<doc id="294120" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=294120" title="Validity">
Validity

Validity is an idea that is used in everyday language and in logic. In ordinary language it means correct or in the right form.
An argument is valid if it seems appropriate, well-grounded and can be defended. A contract is valid if it is enforceable in law. In other words, it applies legally to a particular situation. A bank-note is valid if it can be exchanged and used for purchase, and a passport is valid if it lets the holder come in and go out of a country. A will is valid if correctly made, and certified by an appropriate court. In all these cases, valid refers to the soundness in some situation. Logical uses of this idea are similar, but phrased much more exactly.
It is nothing to do with ordinary ideas of truth. Truth points outwards to the world. Validity, on the other hand, points inwards to the syllogism.
The conclusion of a valid argument is a logical consequence of its premises. An example of a valid argument is given by the following well-known syllogism:
And it is not true that Socrates was green.
The problem with the argument is that it is not "sound". In order for a deductive argument to be sound, the deduction must be valid and all the premises true.

Srbosjek

Srbosjek (literally "Serb cutter" in Croatian, often referred to as "cutthroat") is the colloquial Croatian term for a type of knife used for killing prisoners in Croatian concentration camps in World War II.
The knife gained notoriety in the former Yugoslavian countries because it was used by the Croatian Ustaše during World War II for the killing of prisoners in the concentration camps of the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia, most notably the Jasenovac concentration camp. The victims were Serbs, Muslims, Jews, Croats and Roma, imprisoned on 'ethnic' grounds, imprisoned on the grounds that they were Yugoslav Partisans resistance members, or on the suspicion of taking part in anti-fascist activities.
The upper part of the knife was made of leather, as a sort of a glove, designed to be worn with the thumb going through the hole, so that only the blade protruded from the hand. It was a curved, 12 cm long knife with the edge on its concave side. The knife was fastened to a bowed oval copper plate, while the plate was fastened to a thick leather bangle. The knife was fixed on the glove plate in order to prevent injuries and to prevent taking care of a separate knife in order to improve the work speed.
Such a type of wheat sheaf knife was manufactured prior to and during World War II by German factory Gebrüder Gräfrath from Solingen under the trademark "Gräwiso". 
Gebrüder Gräfrath was taken over in 1961 by Hubertus Solingen.
In the Jasenovac concentration camp competitions in speedy slaughter were organized by the Ustaše. The winner of one such competition, Petar Brzica slit the throats of 1,300 (or 1360 ) prisoners.

The Status of Indian cities has two Government of India ranking systems used to pay workers more in some cities. There are two allowances; Compensatory City Allowance (CCA) to pay more because it is more expensive to buy things in cities. CCA is divided into categories "A-1", "A", "B-1" and "B-2". House Rent Allowance (HRA) is the second additional payment. It is divided into categories "A-1", "A", "B-1", "B-2" and "C". This plan was first based on the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission of India (1997). City statuses were later changed based on the results of the 2001 Census of India.

Life processes

Biology is the science that deals with living things. In general:
Many things that appear to be one organism are in fact several living together. An example is lichen. Lichen is a symbiosis between a blue-green alga and a fungus. Organisms that live together may not reproduce together, but their life processes are bound up together. They help each other to live.
Modern ideas from molecular biology, cell biology and cybernetics give us more ways of describing biological processes.
All life processes on Earth use the chemistry of carbon compounds. In particular, all life uses long-chain molecules such as proteins and nucleic acid. With water, which is essential, the long molecules are wrapped inside membranes to form cells. This is true of all known life.
Living organisms are open systems. The main idea is that the processes serve to keep them alive by homeostasis. They are always changing, but always staying within certain limits as long as they live. 
They do this by exchanging materials and information with their environment. They undergo metabolism, maintain homeostasis, possess a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli and reproduce. All of this preserves the individual and its race or species.

Cinco de Mayo

Cinco de Mayo (Spanish for "fifth of May") is a holiday celebrating Mexican heritage and pride, and is held on May 5. In which lots of tacos are consumed by Mexicans. It is celebrated in the United States and in some parts of Mexico, mostly in the state of Puebla. Cinco de Mayo is not Mexico's Independence Day, the most important national holiday in Mexico.
In the Mexican state of Puebla, Cinco de Mayo is celebrated because the Mexican army won the Battle of Puebla from the French army on May 5, 1862. This was a surprising victory. The army was under the leadership of General Ignacio Zaragoza Seguín.
In the United States Cinco de Mayo is more important than in Mexico. It is a day to celebrate the culture and experiences of Americans of Mexican ancestry. This is in the same way as other holidays like , Oktoberfest, and the Chinese New Year are used to celebrate those of Irish, German, and Chinese ancestry. Cinco de Mayo is celebrated by many Americans, not only by Americans of Mexican origin. Celebrations use both traditional Mexican symbols, like the Virgen de Guadalupe, and prominent figures with Mexican roots in the United States, including César Chávez. Many people display Cinco de Mayo banners while schools organize events to educate pupils about Mexico. Special events and celebrations highlight Mexican culture, especially its music and regional dancing. Examples include "baile folklórico" and "mariachi" demonstrations held every year at the Plaza del Pueblo de Los Angeles, near Olvera Street. Businesses advertise Mexican products and services, especially Mexican drinks, foods, and music.
Cinco de Mayo is a regional holiday limited mostly to the state of Puebla.
Cinco de Mayo is also celebrated outside Mexico and the United States. For example, a sky-diving club near Vancouver, Canada, holds a Cinco de Mayo skydiving event. In the Cayman Islands, in the Caribbean, there is an yearly Cinco de Mayo air guitar competition. As far away as the island of Malta, in the Mediterranean Sea, revelers are encouraged to drink Mexican beer on May 5.

The Mérida State Symphony Orchestra (Spanish: Orquesta Sinfónica del Estado Mérida or OSEM) is a symphony orchestra based in the Venezuelan city of Mérida. A non-profit organization, it was founded in 1991 by the Venezuelan pianist and educator José Antonio Abreu. 
The orchestra was established on June 21, 1991 and evolved from the Mérida State Youth Symphony Orchestra, founded in 1978 as part of the System of Youth Orchestras of Venezuela (FESNOJIV) and led by José Antonio Abreu. 
Its co-founder and first artistic director was Amílcar Rivas. Between 1994 and 1997, its Music Director was Sergio Bernal who extended the orchestra's repertoire of European and Latin American symphonic music. Between 1998 and 2001, the OSEM was led by Felipe Izcaray who initiated major programs of community outreach and education which became a fundamental part of the orchestra's activities. César Iván Lara has been the orchestra's Music Director since January 2004.
In the 2006 season, the orchestra participated in many official events of the Mérida State Government, University of the Andes, the FESNOJIV, and various municipalities, giving 39 symphony concerts and 108 teaching and chamber concerts in 21 municipalities in the State of Mérida. In 1999 the OSEM was designated a "Patrimonio Cultural del Estado Mérida" (Cultural Patrimony of the State of Mérida).
The orchestra began its 20th anniversary year on January 15, 2011 with a performance of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 2 for the second annual Festival de Música de Mérida.

Patriot Day is a day of remembrance in the United States. It happens on September 11 of each year. It remembers the 2,977 killed in the September 11, 2001 attacks. Most Americans call this day "Nine-Eleven (9/11)," "September Eleventh," or something similar.
The day was officially created on October 25, 2001. The U.S. House of Representatives Joint Resolution 71 was approved by a vote of 407–0. The Resolution asked that the President would designate September 11 of each year as "Patriot Day." President George W. Bush signed the resolution into law on December 18, 2001 (as Public Law 107-89). On September 4, 2002, President Bush proclaimed September 11, 2002 as Patriot Day. 
On this day, the American flag is to be flown at half-staff at individual American homes, at the White House, and on all U.S. government buildings, home and abroad. The President also asks Americans to observe a moment of silence beginning at 8:46 A.M. (Eastern Daylight Time). This is the time the first plane struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.

Saint Walburga

Saint Walpurga or Walburga (; c. 710 – February 25, 777 or 779), also spelled Valderburg or Guibor, was an English missionary to the Frankish Empire. She was canonized ("made a saint") on 1 May ca. 870 by Pope Adrian II. 
Walpurga's feast day is on 25 February. The day of her canonization, 1 May, was also celebrated during the high medieval period. Especially in the 11th century under Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne. Walpurgis Night is the eve of May Day, celebrated in folklore in Europe with dancing.
Together with her brothers, Saint Willibald and Saint Winibald, she travelled to Francia (now Württemberg and Franconia) to help her uncle, Saint Boniface, in evangelizing among the Germans. She was educated by the nuns of Winborne Abbey, Dorset, where she spent twenty-six years. Thanks to her rigorous training, she was later able to write St. Winibald's "biography" and an account in Latin of St. Willibald's travels in Palestine. She is often credited with being the first female author of both England and Germany. 
She became a nun and lived in the double monastery of Heidenheim am Hahnenkamm near Eichstätt, which was founded by her brother, Willibald. After his death in 751, she became abbess. Walburga died on 25 February 777 or 779 and was buried at Heidenheim. In the 870s, her remains were brought to Eichstätt. 
At Eichstätt, her bones were placed in a rocky hole in the wall. The bones began to produce, it was said, a miraculously therapeutic oil. This made people come to her shrine.
The earliest picture of Walpurga is from the early 11th century. It comes from the Hitda Codex, which was made in Cologne. It shows her holding stylized stalks of grain. The grain can be seen as an example of where a Christian saint (Walpurga) took over from an older pagan concept, in this case of the Grain Mother. 
Walpurga is the patroness of Eichstätt, Antwerp, Oudenaarde, Veurne, Groningen, Zutphen and other towns in the Low Countries.

Leif Erikson Day

Leif Erikson Day is a holiday in the American and happens on October 9. It honors Leif Ericson, the Norse explorer who brought the first Europeans known to have set foot in North America. 
"America Not Discovered by Columbus" by Rasmus B. Anderson was published in 1874. This book helped make popular the idea that Vikings were the first Europeans in the New World. In 1925, American President Calvin Coolidge recognised Leif Erikson as the Discoverer of America. This was due to research by Norwegian-American scholars such as Knut Gjerset and Ludvig Hektoen. 
In 1930, Wisconsin became the first state to officially adopt Leif Erikson Day as a state holiday. A year later, the state of Minnesota did the same. By 1956, Leif Erikson Day was an official holiday seven states (Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota, Illinois, Colorado, Washington, and California) and one Canadian province (Saskatchewan). 
In 1963, the U.S. Representative from Duluth, John Blatnik, introduced a bill to observe Leif Erikson Day in the rest of the United States. In 1964, the United States Congress authorized and requested the President to create the observance through a yearly proclamation. Lyndon B. Johnson and each President since have done so. Presidents have used the proclamation to praise the spirit of discovery and the contributions of Americans of Nordic descent generally. Some states officially commemorate Leif Erikson Day, particularly in the Upper Midwest, where large numbers of people from the Nordic countries settled.
October 9th is not related with any event in Leif Erikson's life. The date was chosen because the ship "Restauration" coming from Stavanger, Norway, arrived in New York Harbor on October 9, 1825. This was the start of the first organized immigration from Norway to the United States.

Guelders

Guelders or Gueldres (, ) is the name of a historical county. This became a duchy ("lands ruled by a duke or duchess") of the Holy Roman Empire, in the Low Countries.
The duchy was named after the town of Geldern ("Gelder") in what is now called Germany. The present province of Gelderland (English also "Guelders") in the Netherlands occupies most of the area. However, the former duchy also included parts of the present Dutch province of Limburg and the territories in the present-day German state of North Rhine-Westphalia that were acquired by Prussia in 1713. 
The duchy had four special parts, which had their own centres:
and was separated from the Lower Quarters (Gelderland):
The county was first mentioned in about 1096, when Gerard III of Wassenberg was first documented as "Count of Guelders". It was then in the territory of Lower Lorraine, in the area of Geldern and Roermond. Its main stronghold was at Montfort (built 1260). Count Gerard's son Gerard II in 1127 got the County of Zutphen in northern Hamaland by marriage. In the 12th and 13th century, Guelders became larger very quickly downstream along the sides of the Maas, Rhine, and IJssel rivers. It even claimed the lands in the Duchy of Limburg. In 1288, it lost the Battle of Worringen against Berg and Brabant.
Guelders was often at war with its neighbours. Not only with Brabant, but also with the County of Holland and the Bishopric of Utrecht. Its territory did not only grow because of its success in warfare, it also did very well in times of peace. William II, count of both Holland and Zeeland, gave Nijmegen in use to Guelders in return of a loan. However he was not able to repay the debts, so these lands became integral parts of Guelders. 
In 1339 Count Reginald II of Guelders became a duke as ordered by Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV of Wittelsbach. When Reginald died without an heir in 1371, William I of Jülich inherited Guelders. In 1423 Guelders passed to the House of Egmond. Duke Adolf was fighting with his father Arnold about the inheritance of the land. Arnold came under pressure from the Burgundian duke Charles the Bold, who put him in prison in 1471. When Arnold died in 1473, Duke Charles added Guelders to his Burgundian Netherlands.
The last independent Duke of Guelders was Adolf's son Charles of Egmond (1492-1538). He increased the size of the duchy northward, and included what is now the Province of Overijssel. He left the duchy to Duke William the Rich of Jülich-Cleves-Berg in his will. However, he was not able to hold on to it and Emperor Charles V of Habsburg soon moved in. Guelders finally lost its independence, when it was united with the Seventeen Provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands in 1543.
Charles V stood down in 1556. He decided that the territories of the Burgundian Circle should be part of the monarchy of Spain. The northern Netherlands stood up against King Philip II of Spain in the Dutch Revolt. The three northern quarters of Gelderland joined the Union of Utrecht and became part of the United Provinces when the 1581 Act of Abjuration was agreed. Only the Upper Quarter remained a part of the Spanish Netherlands. 
The Treaty of Utrecht ended the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713. The Spanish Upper Quarter was again divided between Prussian Guelders (Geldern, Viersen, Horst, Venray), the United Provinces (Venlo, Montfort, Echt), Austria (Roermond, Niederkrüchten, Weert), and the Duchy of Jülich (Erkelenz). 
In 1795 Guelders was conquered and incorporated by the French First Republic. It was divided between the départements of Roer and Meuse-Inférieure.
The coat of arms of the region changed during the ages.

Nickelodeon on CBS

Nick on CBS was a Saturday morning children's programming block for CBS that began on September 16, 2000, replacing CBS Kidshow. This Saturday morning block presented programming from Nick Jr., which at a time shared common ownership with CBS under Viacom. When the block first properly aired, it was hosted by Face from Nick Jr.
On September 14, 2002, "Nick Jr. on CBS" was re-branded as Nick on CBS, and airing both Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. shows. The Nickelodeon shows were removed in 2005 in favor for a return to an exclusively-Nick Jr. block. The block's continuity was provided by segments featuring Piper O'Possum.
At the beginning of New Year's Eve 2005, Viacom split into two different companies, with CBS Corporation becoming its own standalone company and Nickelodeon going to new Viacom. "Nick Jr. on CBS" ended on September 9, 2006 and was replaced by "KOL Secret Slumber Party on CBS" on September 16, 2006, as part of a multi-year partnership between CBS and Cookie Jar Entertainment.
All programming during the block, as is standard for Saturday morning network programming, was labelled as meeting E/I requirements, as tennous as some of the claims of educational content may have been. This is part of the reason why some of Nickelodeon's most popular programs (most notably "SpongeBob SquarePants" and "The Fairly OddParents") did not appear on the block, even during the more open-formatted "Nick on CBS" era.

Parabola

The parabola (from the Greek παραβολή) is a type of curve. Menaechmus (380–320 BC) discovered the parabola, and Apollonius of Perga (262 BC–c190 BC) first named it.
A parabola is a conic section. If a cone is dissected by a plane which is parallel to one of the surfaces of the cone, the result is a parabola. The point where the parabola reaches its maximum or minimum is called the "vertex." At this point the curvature of the parabola is greatest.
Each parabola has a focal point. Any ray that enters the parabola and is parallel to the axis of symmetry will pass through this point after being reflected by the curve. Because of this fact, parabolas are important in devices such as satellite dishes, or magnifying mirrors. Parabolas are often used to approximate curves that are more difficult to model by themselves.
Every parabola uses the equation formula_1, where formula_2, formula_3 and formula_4 are constants, and formula_2 is not equal to formula_6.

Nizam of Hyderabad

Nizam was the title of the native sovereigns of Hyderabad State, India, since 1719. They belonged to the Asaf Jah dynasty. The dynasty was founded by Mir Qamar-ud-Din Siddiqi, a viceroy of the Deccan under the Mughal emperors from 1713 to 1721. After Aurangzeb's death in 1707, the Mughal Empire fell apart and the viceroy in Hyderabad said he was independent. From 1798 Hyderabad was one of the princely states of British India, but it kept local control.
Seven Nizams ruled Hyderabad for two centuries until Indian independence in 1947. The Asaf Jahi rulers used money to support much literature, art, architecture, culture, jewelry and rich food. The Nizams ruled the state until September 1948 after independence from the British.
The Asaf Jahi dynasty began near Samarkand. The family came to India from Baghdad in the late 17th century. They were direct descendants of the first Khalifa of Islam, Hazrat Sayyadina Abu bakr Siddiq Razi Allahutaala Anha.
Nizām-ul-mulk was a title first used in Urdu around 1600. It comes from the Arabic word, nizām (), meaning "order, arrangement". The Nizam was also called Ala Hadrat, Ala Hazrat, or Nizam Sarkar.
The first Nizam ruled in place of the Mughal emperors. After Aurangzeb died, the Nizams left the Mughals to make an independent kingdom. When the British got power over India, the Nizams were allowed to continue to rule for the British. The Nizams kept power in Hyderabad State until 17 September 1948. Hyderabad then became part of the new Indian Union.
The Asaf Jah dynasty had only seven rulers. However, for 13 years after the rule of the first Nizam, three of his sons (Nasir Jung, Muzafar Jung and Salabath Jung) ruled. They were not officially recognized as the rulers.
A legend about the first Nizam says that, on one of his hunting trips he was offered some kulchas (an Indian bread) by a holy man. He asked the Nizam to eat as many as he could. The Nizam ate seven kulchas and the holy man predicted that seven generations of his family would rule the state.
By tradition no Nizam has ever left India, even if there was good a reason.
Hyderabad did not join the first war of Indian Independence of 1857 against the British. Therefore its Royal Family had special, official status of "Faithful Ally" with Britain.
The Asaf Jahis were built many palaces.
Other landmarks like the Andhra Pradesh High Court, Jubilee Hall, Asafia library, The Assembly building, the Osmania Arts College and the Osmania Medical College are some of their important buildings.
The Nizams liked the European style of architecture and created a fusion of European traditions with Hindu and Islamic forms and images.
After the British left India in 1947, the princely state of Hyderabad did not join either of the new dominions of India or Pakistan. The Nizam's rule ended on 17 September 1948. His soldiers surrendered to Indian soldiers.
All Nizams are buried in the royal graves at the Makkah Masjid near Charminar in Hyderabad. Only the last Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan is buried in a different place. His mausoleum is in the Judi Mosque facing King Kothi Palace.

Shiogama is in the central part of Miyagi Prefecture. It is between Sendai and Matsushima. The city is surrounded by water and mountains: Matsushima Bay is on one side and Matsushima Hills on the other.
The flat areas of the city are mainly reclaimed land. About 60 percent of the urban area is on reclaimed land and 40 percent on hills. People living in the town are crowded into a narrow area. Not much land is good for stripmalls.
The Japanese language has several writing systems. One of them is kanji. Different kanji may have the same pronunciation. Some kanji are similar in form and meaning. There are two ways to write the name of the city. Both ways have the basic meaning "a pot for boiling salt". Both sound the same, but have slightly different meanings.
One way is to write 塩釜. The other way is 塩竈. The first way to write the city name is often used, such as on the post office, train station, many brand names, and on signs.
The second way comes from the history and an important landmark in the city. Shiogama shrine is at the top of a hill in the city. It is an important Shinto shrine in the Tohoku region. The city got its name from the shrine, but the shrine is written 鹽竈神社. The first character, 鹽, is an old character for salt. It has been replaced in the list of kanji for general use by a simpler character, 塩. The second character, 竈, or kamado/kama, means a large cooking area made of earth. The newer name uses 釜, which means an iron pot.

It, along with Wake Up Dead from the same album, has been a staple at Megadeth concerts. Lyrically, it deals with negative stereotypes about "metalheads", all of which Mustaine claims are untrue. VH1 has ranked "Peace Sells" at #11 on their list of the 40 greatest metal songs of all time.
Music video was produced for the song, which features a teenage boy, wearing a Slayer t-shirt, watching a montage of a live Megadeth performance and war footage on his living room television set. The boy's father, states "What is this garbage you're watching? I want to watch the news!," and changes the television channel to a news station using the remote control. His son, replying with "This "is" the news!," changes it back to the Megadeth performance using the TV set's channel knob. This part of the video was parodied by comedian Brian Posehn in his "Metal by Numbers" video. The beginning of the video also showed the explosion of the original low-cost skull used on the previous album Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!

A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery

A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery is an 18-th century oil painting by Joseph Wright of Derby. The painting shows a teacher talking about the sun and planets to his class. Wright later created his similar "An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump" (National Gallery, London) in 1768.
Wright's "The Orrery", caused a great debate, because in the past, only religious events were used to express awe. Wright used science to do so. Wright lived in the technological age, so he treated religious events and scientific miracles. In the orrery demonstration, the shadows created by the lamp mimic the sun, and it is a part of the display. He used a single candle to make his painting dramatic. In two later paintings, the lighting is normal.
One person called Wright "a very great and uncommon genius in a peculiar way". "The Orrery" was painted without payment. Wright expected that Washington Shirley, 5th Earl Ferrers, an amateur astronomer, will buy the painting, because Shirley had his own orrery, and Wright's friend Peter Perez Burdett was staying with him. Figures are considered to be portraits of Burdett and Ferrers. In the picture, Burdett is taking notes and Ferrers is seated with his son next to the orrery. Ferrers purchased the painting for £210, but the 6th Earl sold it at an auction. It is now held by Derby Museum and Art Gallery as its permanent display.
Some people say that John Whitehurst was the model for the teacher. However, other people say the figure is similar to "a painting of Isaac Newton by Godfrey Kneller".

Frankfurt Parliament

The Frankfurt Parliament (, literally "Frankfurt National Assembly") was the first freely elected parliament for all of Germany. Session was held from May 18, 1848 to May 31, 1849 in the Paulskirche at Frankfurt am Main. It was elected during the "March Revolution" in the states of the German Confederation.
The assembly produced the so-called Paulskirche Constitution () which proclaimed a German Empire based on the principles of parliamentary democracy. This constitution fulfilled the main demands of the liberal and nationalist movements of the Vormärz and provided a foundation of human rights. The parliament also proposed a constitutional monarchy headed by a hereditary emperor ("Kaiser"). The Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm IV did not accept the office of emperor when it was offered to him. He argued such an offer was an offence against the rights of the princes of the individual German states. In the 20th century, however, major elements of the Frankfurt constitution became models for the Weimar Constitution of 1919 and the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany of 1949.

Frederick William IV of Prussia

King Frederick William IV of Prussia () (15 October 1795 – 2 January 1861) was the eldest son and successor of Frederick William III of Prussia. He reigned as King of Prussia from 1840 to 1861. 
Frederick William was educated by private tutors. He served in the army during the War of Liberation against Napoleon I of France in 1814, but he was not interested in the army. He loved both architecture and landscape gardening and was a patron of several great German artists, such as architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel and the composer Felix Mendelssohn. He married Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria in 1823, but the couple had no children.
Frederick William was Romanticist, and had a nostalgia for the Middle Ages, therefore he was conservative already at an early age. He was against both liberalisation and unification of Germany and preferred to allow Austria to remain the first power in the German states.
In the beginning of his reign he did not continue the reactionary policies of his father, he reduced press censorship and promised a constitution, but he did not want a popular legislative assembly, but preferred to work with the aristocracy. He was Lutheran, but he released the imprisoned Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cologne, and he decided to help the construction of Cologne Cathedral. In 1844, he attended the celebrations of the completion of the cathedral, so he was the first king of Prussia who entered a Roman Catholic building. When he finally called a national assembly in 1847, it was not a representative body, but rather a United Diet which cold speak for all the provincial estates and had the right to grant taxes and loans but no right to meet at regular intervals.
When revolution broke out in Prussia in March 1848, as part of the European Revolutions of 1848, the king initially decided to fight it with the army, but later decided to recall the troops and place himself at the head of the movement on 19 March. He committed himself to German unification, formed a liberal government, accepted a national assembly, and ordered that a Constitution of the Kingdom of Prussia should be drawn up. When his position was more secure again, however, he quickly led the army to reoccupy Berlin and dissolved the assembly in December. But he was still in favour of unification for some time. So the Frankfurt Parliament offered him the crown of Germany on 3 April 1849. He did not accept it, but he tried to establish a union of German states excluding Austria. But rather soon after gave up this plan, when Austria did not accept it.
When he had dismissed the national assembly, Frederick William decided to have a constitution with a parliament with two chambers, an aristocratic upper house and an elected lower house. The lower house was elected by all taxpayers, but in a system that was based on the amount of taxes paid so that the rich had more influence than the poor. The constitution also reserved for the king the power to appoint all ministers and reestablished the conservative district assemblies and provincial diets. And it guaranteed that the bureaucracy and the military remained firmly in the hands of the king. This was a more liberal system than had existed in Prussia before 1848, but was still a conservative system of government in which the monarch, the aristocracy, and the military kept most of the power. This constitution lasted until the end of the Prussian kingdom in 1918.
After a stroke in 1857 the king was partially paralyzed and largely mentally weak, therefore his brother William became regent from 1858 until the king's death in 1861, then he became king himself as William I.

Australopithecus garhi

Australopithecus garhi is a gracile australopithecine species discovered in Ethiopia. The remains of this hominin are believed to be a human ancestor species, and perhaps the ancestor of the human genus "Homo". The fossils were found in 1996 in the Bouri Formation. This is in the Middle Awash of Ethiopia's Afar Depression.
Some primitive shaped stone tool artifacts closely resembling Olduwan technology were discovered with the "A. garhi" fossils, dating back roughly 2.5 and 2.6 million years old. The tools are thought to be older than those found with "Homo habilis", which may be a direct ancestor of more modern hominins. 
For a long time anthropologists assumed that only members of early genus "Homo" had the ability to produce sophisticated tools. At another site in Bouri, Ethiopia, roughly 3,000 stone artifacts had been found to be about 2.5 million years old in age. "Australopithecus garhi" may have been the species responsible for making and using these earliest stone tools.

World Nuclear Industry Status Report

The World Nuclear Industry Status Report is a yearly report about the global challenges facing the nuclear power industry. The reports show that the share of nuclear-generated electricity in the overall global energy production has decreased in the 2000s. Nuclear power now accounts for about 13 percent of the world’s electricity generation and 5.5 percent of primary energy.
The "World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2010-2011" is authored by Mycle Schneider, Antony Froggatt, and Steve Thomas and published by the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute. The foreword is written by Amory Lovins.
According to the report, the international nuclear power industry has been unable to stop the slow decline of nuclear energy. The world’s reactor fleet is aging quickly and not enough new units are coming online. As of April 1, 2011, there were 437 nuclear reactors operating in the world, which was seven fewer than in 2002. The Olkiluoto plant has had particular problems:
The flagship EPR project at Olkiluoto in Finland, managed by the largest nuclear builder in the world, AREVA NP, has turned into a financial fiasco. The project is four years behind schedule and at least 90 percent over budget, reaching a total cost estimate of €5.7 billion ($8.3 billion) or close to €3,500 ($5,000) per kilowatt.
The report says that the Fukushima I nuclear accidents have made things more difficult for nuclear energy. There is "no obvious sign that the international nuclear industry could eventually turn empirically evident downward trend into a promising future", and the Fukushima nuclear disaster is likely to accelerate the decline. With long lead times of 10 years and more, it will be difficult to maintain, let alone increase, the number of operating nuclear power plants over the next 20 years. Moreover, says the report, it is clear that nuclear power development cannot keep up with the pace of renewable energy commercialization.

Attempted Italian colonization of America

An attempted Italian colonization in America was done in 1608 by the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinando I.
The Italian colonization of the Americas was limited to an aborted attempt by the Grand Duke of Tuscany to create a colony in South America in the early 1600s.
In 1608, Ferdinando the First of Tuscany organized an expedition under captain Robert Thornton, in order to explore northern Brazil and the Amazon river and prepare for the establishment of a settlement in northern coastal South America, which would serve as a base to export Brazilian wood to Renaissance Italy.
Ferdinando the First, Grand Duke of Tuscany, oversaw the only Italian attempt to create a colony in the Americas.
When Thornton returned to Tuscany a year later, he found Ferdinando I dead, and his successor Cosimo II uninterested in the establishment of a colony. Thornton was ready to sail back to the area between the rivers Orinoco and Amazon in the summer of 1609 with Italian settlers from Livorno and Lucca, but the project was scrapped.
Thornton's galleon 'Santa Lucia' returned to Italy in 1609 with plenty of information (after exploring the area between Trinidad island and the delta of the Amazon river), some indigenous natives of the Americas and a few tropical parrots.
He brought back with him to Tuscany five Arawak natives, most of whom died of smallpox. Only one lived on at the Medici court for several years, and learned to speak Italian. These natives often talked about the richness and fertility of their native land, speaking of a country rich in silver and gold. Thornton himself corroborated these reports, and asserted that the country was rich in rosewood, wild sugar canes, white pepper, balsam, cotton and many other kinds of merchandise which would form an abundant commerce for the Tuscans.
The area that Thornton considered as a possible site of an Italian colony now lies in modern French Guyana, near Cayenne, which would be colonised by France in 1630.
The Italians never created real colonies in the Americas, and only made territorial colonies in other areas of the world mainly after their political unification in the 19th century.
Many Italians (and similarly Germans) moved to America to live under other flags and created the settlements of emigrants, sometimes called called "colonies". Those settlements where made by groups of Italian emigrants who settled together in the same place and around the same time, founding a settlement that still exists today in many cases.
That was the first Italian settlement of this kind made in Venezuela by Luigi Castelli, who wanted to settle in the late 1830s Italian emigrants from Tuscany in the same area where a few years later German emigrants settled and created the "Colonia Tovar" (unluckily their ship sank in the Mediterranean).
Many of these Italian settlements were created in the second half of the 19th century, mainly in Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Mexico and the Southern Region of Brazil (Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul).
In most of those settlements the Italian language (and dialects) is still spoken today: like in "Capitán Pastene" of Chile, in "Chipilo" of Mexico or in "Nova Veneza" of Santa Catarina (where it is spoken the "Talian" of Brasil).
None of these settlements are related to the Italian colonial empire of the 20th century.

Homo cepranensis

Homo cepranensis is a proposed name for a human species, known from only one skull cap discovered in 1994. The fossil was discovered by archeologist Italo Biddittu and was nicknamed "Ceprano Man" after a nearby town in the province of Frosinone, 89 kilometers Southeast of Rome, Italy.
The age of the fossil is estimated to be between 350,000 to 500,000 years old.[3] An adjacent site, Fontana Ranuccio, was dated to 487,000 +/- 6000 years and Muttoni et al. suggest that Ceprano is most likely 450,000 years old. The cranial features on the bone seem to be intermediate between those found on "Homo erectus" and those of later species such as "Homo heidelbergensis" which dominated Europe long before "Homo neanderthalensis". There is yet not enough material to make a complete analysis of the individual.

Homo antecessor

Homo antecessor is an extinct human species dating from 1.2 million to 800,000 years ago, that was discovered by Eudald Carbonell, Juan Luis Arsuaga and J. M. Bermúdez de Castro. "H. antecessor" is one of the earliest known human varieties in Europe. 
The best-preserved fossil is a maxilla that belonged to a 10-year-old individual found in Atapuerca, Spain. At the site were numerous examples of cuts where the flesh had been flensed from the bones, which indicates that "H. antecessor" could have practised cannibalism.

Gelug

The Gelug or Gelug-pa, is a school of Tibetan Buddhism founded by Je Tsongkhapa (1357–1419), a philosopher and Tibetan religious leader. The first monastery he established was at Ganden, and to this day the Ganden Tripa is the nominal head of the school, though its most famous person is the Dalai Lama. There are others Gelug Masters, like Trijang Rinpoche and Ling Rinpoche.
Tsongkhapa was a big promoter of the Kadampa (Bka'-gdams-pa) teachings and the mahāyāna principle of universal compassion as the fundamental spiritual orientation. He combined this with a strong emphasis on the cultivation of in-depth insight into the doctrine of emptiness as taught by the Indian masters Nāgārjuna (2nd century) and Candrakīrti (7th century). Tsongkhapa said that these two aspects of the spiritual path, compassion and insight into wisdom, must be rooted in a big wish for liberation driven by a genuine sense of renunciation. He called these the "Three Principal Aspects of the Path", and said that it is on the basis of these three that one must embark on the profound path of vajrayāna Buddhism.
The central teachings of the Gelug School are the Stages of the Path ("lamrim"), based on the teachings of the Indian master Atiśa (c. 11th century) and the systematic cultivation of the view of emptiness. This is combined with the yogas of highest yoga tantra deities such as Guhyasamāja, Cakrasaṃvara, Yamāntaka and Kālacakra, where the key focus is the direct experience of the union of bliss and emptiness.

6-plus-6-instruments are musical instruments having each 12 tones. Their keys or cords are in two rows. In each row the tone distance is a whole-tone distance. The distance between both rows is a half-tone distance. So there is the same fingering in all 6 scales where the base tone is in the same row. If there is a third row, which is the same like the first row, there is the same fingering in all 12 scales, e. g. on a piano with a Janko keyboard.

Each week on New Changes, two new article titles appear as part of TotW. How are they decided? People vote. Well, actually very few people vote. If anyone active here on Simple could take a few minutes once in a while to vote it would really help. This project seems like a natural part of the purpose of Simple English Wikipedia. If translations are done here (often from en to simple) then it should help translators in other languages too. It would be a good way to show the value of Simple to other wikis. Some of the candidates are really interesting, but some are actually quite hard to translate. If a few of us vote, we should see some great new articles here on Simple with lots of interwiki links.

The Red Barn Murder was a murder (killing) that happened in Polstead in 1827. A man named William Corder shot his lover, Maria Marten. The Red Barn was a local landmark. Marten and Corder were going to meet at the barn and then elope to (run away and get married) Ipswich. Corder ran away to London and married another woman. He sent Marten's family letters that said that Maria was happy and healthy.
Maria Marten's mother had dreams about the murder. In the dreams, Maria's ghost pointed to where she was buried in the barn. On April 19, 1828, Maria's body was found in a sack (a bag) in a bin for holding grain. The London police found Corder and arrested him. They also found two pistols that he had bought the day of the murder.
The trial started on August 7, 1828. It was held at Shire Hall in Bury St Edmunds. William Corder was charged with killing Maria Marten by shooting and stabbing her. He was also charged with forgery. There were a total of 9 charges. He pleaded not guilty.
The jury deliberated for only 35 minutes. ("Deliberating" is when the people in the jury talk and try to decide if the person is guilty or not guilty.) Corder was found guilty. He was sentenced to death by hanging. The judge ordered that after he was dead his body was to be dissected.
William Corder died on August 11, 1828 just before noon. He was hanged at the gallows in Bury St Edmunds. Many people showed up to see him die. One newspaper said there were 7,000 people who showed up. Another newspaper said there were 20,000. After he was dead, the body was taken back to the courtroom. More than 5,000 people came to the courtroom to see Corder's body. His body was dissected the next day. His skeleton was put on display in the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons of England. In 2004, it was taken down and cremated.

Quantum gravity

Quantum gravity is an area of research in physics. Right now, physics is able to describe gravity of real-life sized objects using general relativity. Physicists can also describe the universe on a microscopic scale with quantum mechanics. The goal of quantum gravity is to develop a theory which contains both general relativity and quantum mechanics. However, combining the theories of the big and the small is very difficult in practice. 
Physicists are working on a number of ways to write down a theory of quantum gravity. One approach is to search for a unified field theory. Physicists also try to develop theories at an even more fundamental level, like string theory, loop quantum gravity, or other methods, to find out why our current theories of gravity and quantum mechanics cannot be combined.

Wonderama

Wonderama was a long-running children's television program. It appeared on Metromedia-owned stations from 1955 to 1986. The show was made at WNEW-TV in New York City.
"Wonderama" also was run in five other markets in which Metromedia owned television stations, including WTTG in Washington D.C., KMBC-TV in Kansas City, KTTV in Los Angeles, WXIX-TV in Cincinnati and WTCN-TV in Minneapolis – Saint Paul. The show ran three hours long, and later two hours on Sunday mornings. 
Despite the frequent turnover of hosts throughout the 1950s, "Wonderama" experienced its greatest viewership by way of one-time Baltimore kids' show host Bob McAllister, who replaced Sonny Fox as host in 1967 and remained host until 1977.
Each show's taping included "(but was not necessarily limited to)" education, music, audience participation, games, interviews and cartoon shorts. 
Each week, audience members received a package of parting gifts with some items, including:
McAllister sang the program's closing theme song. It was called "Kids Are People Too" ("wacka-doo, wacka-doo, wacka-doo"). This later became the show's title when it moved to ABC on Sunday mornings. 
Many stars from all genres of entertainment (music, movies, television, etc.) appeared on "Wonderama", including:
Beginning in 1980, a documentary/magazine show for children (and hosted by teens) ran on Sunday mornings on WNEW-TV. While this show maintained the "Wonderama" title, the show itself was nothing like the kids festival that it once was. This hour-long incarnation ran until 1983; reruns edited to 30 minutes aired from 1984 to 1986 on WNEW-TV/WNYW on Saturday mornings.

Asphalt

Asphalt, or bitumen, is a sticky, black and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid, composed almost entirely of petroleum. It is present in most crude petroleums and in some natural deposits. It is the material which made the La Brea tar pits.
Its main use is in road construction. Mixed with "aggregate" (sand, gravel, crushed stone, etc.) it makes a good road surface. It has various other names: pitch, tarmac, blacktop, asphalt concrete, asphalt pavement (US), all mean roughly the same thing.
Asphalt which is liquid is often called tar. Tar is also used for plant resin. Solid asphalt is often called pitch. 
Although a block of asphalt or pitch can look like a solid, it still flows, but very slowly. There have been a few "pitch experiments" to see how long it takes for a drip to form and drop off a block of apparently solid pitch.

The area of the city is 232.29 km² and the population density is 100 people per km². 
The mayor of the city is Futoshi Toba.
As of 2011, oyster farming produced ¥40 million in annual sales for the city.
There is one railroad line with six stations in Rikuzentakata.
Rikuzentakata was reported to have been "wiped off the map" by the tsunami following the Tōhoku earthquake. According to the police, every building smaller than three stories high has been completely flooded. Buildings taller than three stories were partially flooded. At the city hall, water also reached as high as the third floor. 
On 14 March, a BBC report showed a picture of the town. The report described the city as "almost completely flattened." Reporters could not tell how many people had survived. The city did have tsunami shelters. The shelters were designed to protect people from a wave 3 to 4 meters tall. However, the tsunami of March 2011 was 13 meters high in the city. The wave covered the areas that were supposed to be safe. Local officials estimate that 20% to 40% of the cities people died. "Rikuzen-Takata effectively no longer exists." The city had a 6.5 meter high seawall, but it was not enough. More than 80% of 8,000 houses were destroyed by the tsunami.
As of 3 April 2011, 1,000 people from the town were confirmed dead with 1,300 still missing.
Sixty-eight city officials, about one-third of the city's municipal employees, were killed. The town's mayor, Futoshi Toba, was at work at the city hall and survived. His wife was at their seaside home and she died.

It was selected as one of the 100 Landscapes of Japan (Shōwa period) in 1927 and in 1940 it was named a Place of Scenic Beauty. After the 2011 tsunami only one tree was still there. A single, ten-meter tall, two hundred year-old tree is all that is left from the forest. The tree is only five meters from the sea and may be damaged by too much salt. The Association for the Protection of Takata-Matsubara along with the city and prefectural governments are trying to protect the last pine tree.

Encyclopédie

Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers () was a general encyclopedia published in France between 1751 and 1772. The full title was "Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, par une société de gens de lettres, mis en ordre par M. Diderot de l'Académie des Sciences et Belles-Lettres de Prusse, et quant à la partie mathématique, par M. d'Alembert de l'Académie royale des Sciences de Paris, de celle de Prusse et de la Société royale de Londres." 
The "Encyclopédie" was the first encyclopedia to include contributions from many people, and it was the first to include the engineering. Still, the "Encyclopédie" is famous above all for representing the thought of the Enlightenment. According to Denis Diderot in the article "Encyclopédie", the "Encyclopédie"'s aim was "to change the way people think."
The "Encyclopédie" was conceived as a translation of Ephraim Chambers's "Cyclopaedia" (1728). In 1743, the translation was given by the Parisian book publisher André Le Breton to John Mills, an Englishman living in France. In May 1745, Le Breton announced the work as available for sale, but Mills had not done the work. Le Breton beat Mills with a cane. Mills sued for assault, but Le Breton was set free because he was justified. For his new editor, Le Breton chose mathematician Jean Paul de Gua de Malves. In August 1747, Gua de Malves was fired for being a poor leader. Le Breton then hired Diderot and Jean d'Alembert as the new editors. Diderot would remain editor for the next twenty-five years, seeing the "Encyclopédie" through to completion.
Many of the most noted figures of the French Enlightenment contributed to the "Encyclopédie", including Voltaire, Rousseau, and Baron d'Holbach. The most prolific contributor wrote 17,266 articles, or about eight per day, between 1759 and 1765.
Approximate size of the "Encyclopédie":
Print run: 4,250 copies (note: even single-volume works in the 18th Century seldom had a print run of more than 1,500 copies)

The Rhyslings are named for a character in a science fiction story: the blind poet Rhysling, in Robert A. Heinlein's short story "The Green Hills of Earth". Two awards are given: "Best Long Poem", for poetry of 50 or more lines, and "Best Short Poem", for works of 49 or fewer lines.
The members of the Science Fiction Poetry Association (SFPA) choose several possible winners (nominees) for each year's Rhysling Awards. Each member may name one work that should win in each category. All of the nominees are published in a book called "The Rhysling Anthology". Members of the Association then vote on the final winners. Since 2005, the Awards have been presented in July at a ceremony at Readercon. The "Best Short Poem" category allows very short poems to be entered. However, the SFPA also has the Dwarf Stars Award for poems from one to ten lines.

Civil parishes in England

In England, a civil parish is a unit of local government. Civil parishes are the lowest tier of local government, below districts and counties. It is an administrative parish, in comparison to an ecclesiastical (church) parish.
The parish council can decide to call itself a town, village, neighbourhood or community; and in a limited number of cases has city status granted by the monarch. Civil parishes only cover part of England; about 35% of the population. 
There are currently no civil parishes in Greater London, and before 2008 their creation was not permitted within a London Borough.
The creation of ancient parishes was linked to the manorial system. The parishes often shared the same boundaries as the manor of the local lord. At first the manor was the main unit of local administration and justice in the early rural economy. Eventually the church replaced the manor court as the rural administrative centre and levied a local tax on produce known as a tithe. Responsibilitfor things such as relief of the poor passed from the Lord of the Manor to the church, but in practice it was administered by monasteries. After the dissolution of the monasteries, the power to charge (levy) a rate to fund relief of the poor was given to the parish authorities by the 1601 Act for the Relief of the Poor.
The parish authorities were known as vestries and were made up of all the inhabitants of the parish. As the population was growing it became increasingly difficult to hold meetings as an open vestry. In some, mostly built up, areas the select vestry took over responsibility from the community at large. This innovation improved efficiency, but allowed governance by a self-perpetuating elite. The administration of the parish system relied on the monopoly of the Church of England. As religious membership became more fractured, such as through the revival of Methodism, the legitimacy of the parish vestry came into question and the perceived inefficiency and corruption inherent in the system became a source for concern. Because of this scepticism, during early the 19th century the parish progressively lost its powers to ad-hoc boards and other organisations, such as the loss of responsibility for poor relief through the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. The replacement boards were each able to levy their own rate in the parish. The church rate ceased to be levied in many areas and was abolished altogether in 1868.
The ancient parishes split into two distinct units during the 19th century. The Poor Law Amendment Act 1866 declared that all areas that levied a separate rate —extra-parochial areas, townships, and chapelries— become civil parishes as well. The parishes for church use continued unchanged as ecclesiastical parishes. The latter part of the 19th century saw most of the ancient irregularities inherited by the civil system cleaned up, with the majority of exclaves abolished.
Civil parishes in their modern sense were established afresh in 1894, by the Local Government Act 1894. The Act abolished vestries, and established elected parish councils in all rural civil parishes with more than 300 electors. These were grouped into rural districts. Boundaries were altered to avoid parishes being split between counties. Urban parishes continued to exist, and boundaries were usually changed to be the same as the urban district or municipal borough in which they were situated. Large towns originally split between multiple parishes were, for the most part, eventually joined into one parish. No parish councils were formed for urban parishes, and their only function was as areas electing guardians to Poor Law Unions. With the abolition of the poor law system in 1930 the parishes had only a nominal existence.
In 1965 civil parishes in London were formally abolished when Greater London was created, as the legislative framework for Greater London did not make provision for any local government body below a London Borough (since all of London was previously part of a metropolitan borough, municipal borough or urban district, no actual parish councils were abolished). In 1974 the Local Government Act 1972 retained civil parishes in rural areas and small urban areas, but abolished them in larger urban areas. Many former urban districts and municipal boroughs that were being abolished rather than succeeded were continued as new parishes. Urban areas that were considered too large to be single parishes were refused this permission and became unparished areas. The Act also led to the possibility of sub-division of all districts (apart from London boroughs, reformed in 1965), into multiple civil parishes. For example, Oxford, whilst entirely unparished in 1974, now has four civil parishes, covering part of its area.
The creation of town and parish councils is encouraged in unparished areas. The Local Government and Rating Act 1997 gave local residents the right to demand that a new parish and council be created in unparished areas. This was extended to London boroughs by the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 - with this, the City of London is at present the only part of England where civil parishes cannot be created. 
If enough electors in an area of a proposed new parish (ranging from 50% in an area with less than 500 electors to 10% in one with more than 2,500) sign a petition demanding its creation, then the local district council or unitary authority must consider the proposal. Recently established parish councils include Daventry (2003), Folkestone (2004), and Brixham (2007). In 2003 seven new parish councils were set up for Burton upon Trent, and in 2001 the Milton Keynes urban area became entirely parished, with ten new parishes being created. In 2003, the village of Great Coates (Grimsby) regained parish status. Parishes can also be abolished where there is evidence that this in response to "justified, clear and sustained local support" from the area's inhabitants. Examples include Birtley, which was abolished in 2006 and Southsea abolished in 2010.
Every civil parish has a parish meeting, consisting of all the electors of the parish. Generally a meeting is held once a year. A civil parish may have a parish council which exercises various local responsibilities given by statute. If a parish has fewer than 200 electors it is usually deemed too small to have a parish council, and instead will only have a parish meeting; an example of direct democracy. Alternatively several small parishes can be grouped together and share a common parish council, or even a common parish meeting. In places where there is no civil parish (unparished areas), the administration of the activities normally undertaken by the parish becomes the responsibility of the district or borough council. There are about 8,700 parish and town councils in England, and about 1,500 parishes with only parish meetings. Since 1997 around 100 new civil parishes have been created, in some cases splitting existing civil parishes, but mostly by creating new ones from unparished areas.
Typical activities undertaken by parish or town councils include:
The role played by parish councils varies. Smaller parish councils have only limited resources and generally play only a minor role, while some larger parish councils have a role similar to that of a small non-metropolitan district. Parish councils receive funding by levying a "precept" on the council tax paid by the residents of the parish.
Parish councils are run by volunteer councillors who are elected to serve for four years and are not paid. Some councils have chosen to pay their elected members a small allowance as permitted under Part 5 of the Local Government Act 2000 The Local Authorities (Members’ Allowances) (England) Regulations 2003. The number of councillors varies roughly in proportion to the population of the parish. Most parish councillors are elected to represent the entire parish, though in parishes with larger populations or those that cover large areas, the parish can be divided into wards. These wards then return a certain number of councillors each to the parish council (depending on their population). Only if there are more candidates standing for election than there are seats on the council will an election be held. However, sometimes there are fewer candidates than seats. When this happens, the vacant seats have to be filled by co-option by the council. When a vacancy arises for a seat mid-term, an election is only held if a certain number (usually 10) of parish residents request an election. Otherwise the council will co-opt someone to be the replacement councillor. Every Parish Council in England must adopt a code of conduct, and parish councillors must comply with its standards, enforced by the Standards Board for England.
A parish can have city status but only if that is granted by the Crown. In England, there are currently eight parishes with city status, all places with long-established Anglican cathedrals: Chichester, Ely, Hereford, Lichfield, Ripon, Salisbury, Truro and Wells.
The council of an ungrouped parish may unilaterally pass a resolution giving the parish the status of a town. The parish council becomes a "town council". Around 400 parish councils are called town councils. 
Under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, a civil parish may now be given an "alternative style" meaning one of the following:
The chairman of a town council will have the title "town mayor" and that of a parish council which is a city will usually have the title of mayor. As a result, a parish council can also be called a town council, a community council, a village council or occasionally a city council (though most cities are not parishes but principal areas, or in England specifically metropolitan boroughs, non-metropolitan districts).
When a city or town has been abolished as a borough, and it is considered desirable to maintain continuity of the charter, the charter may be transferred to a parish council for its area. Where there is no such parish council, the district council may appoint charter trustees to whom the charter and the arms of the former borough will belong. The charter trustees (who consist of the councillor or councillors for the area of the former borough) maintain traditions such as mayoralty. An example of such a city was Hereford, whose city council was merged in 1998 to form a unitary Herefordshire. The area of the city of Hereford remained unparished until 2000 when a parish council was created for the city. The charter trustees for the City of Bath make up the majority of the councillors on Bath and North East Somerset Council.
Civil parishes do not cover the whole of England. There are none in Greater London and very few in the other conurbations. Civil parishes vary greatly in size: many cover tiny hamlets with populations of less than 100, whereas some large parishes cover towns with populations of tens of thousands. Weston-super-Mare, with a population of 71,758, is the most populous civil parish. In many cases, several small villages are in a single parish. Large urban areas are mostly unparished, as the government at the time of the Local Government Act 1972 discouraged their creation for large towns or their suburbs, but there is generally nothing to stop their establishment. For example, Birmingham has a parish, New Frankley, whilst Oxford has four, and Northampton has seven. Parishes could not however be established in London until the changing of the law in 2007 and as yet none have been established there.
The 2001 census recorded several parishes with no inhabitants. These were Chester Castle (in the middle of Chester city centre), Newland with Woodhouse Moor, Beaumont Chase, Martinsthorpe, Meering, Stanground North (subsequently abolished), Sturston, Tottington, and Tyneham. The last three had been taken over by the British Armed Forces during World War II and remain deserted.
Ancient parishes often had detached parts, exclaves and enclaves which were not joined to the rest of the parish. In some cases the detached part was in a different county. In other cases, an entire parish was in a detached part of the county to which it belonged. There were also many examples of parishes divided between two or more counties.
These anomalies were mostly fixed in the 19th century. Before civil parishes were introduced, the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844 transferred many (but not all) parishes which were detached parts of a county to the county in which they were geographically located. The remaining detached parishes were transferred in the 1890s and in 1931. The detached part of the parish of Tetworth, Huntingdonshire, surrounded by Cambridgeshire, remained until the boundaries were changed in 1965. 
Other laws, including the Divided Parishes and Poor Law Amendment Act 1882, eliminated most instances of civil parishes belonging to two (or more) counties, and by 1901 Stanground in Huntingdonshire and the Isle of Ely was the sole remaining example. Stanground was split into two parishes, one in each county, in 1905.

Glaucoma

Glaucoma is a disease that causes damage to the eye. If a person who has glaucoma does not get help from a doctor, they will not be able to see.
This disease happens because of increased pressure in the eye. The pressure causes damage to the optic nerve. This can cause loss of vision, and may also be painful.
Sometimes, it is hard for a person to know that they have glaucoma. The vision can be lost very slowly.
When sight is lost from glaucoma, that ability to see cannot be recovered.
There are two kinds of glaucoma, the kind that happens very fast, and the kind that happens slowly, over a long time.
Glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness in the world.
There is often a hereditary tendency to glaucoma. A family history of glaucoma is a risk factor. The relative risk of having what is called "primary open-angle glaucoma" (POAG) is increased about two- to four-fold for people who have a sibling with glaucoma. Glaucoma, particularly primary open-angle glaucoma, is associated with mutations in several different genes
Also, the likelihood of it happening is different in different populations. Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness in African Americans, who have higher rates of primary open angle glaucoma.

Tax resistance is when people do not pay a tax because they are angry at how the government uses the money.
Some people are "tax resisters" because they feel bad about helping the government do bad things (like war). Some people are tax resisters to protest. Some people are tax resisters to try to cause a government to fall (like Mohandas Gandhi did in India).

Aye-aye

The aye-aye ("Daubentonia madagascariensis") is a lemur which lives in rain forests of Madagascar, a large island off the southeast coast of Africa. 
This solitary animal is nocturnal (most active at night). The aye-aye spends most of its time in trees. During the day, it sleeps in a nest in the fork of a tree. It builds the nest out of leaves and twigs. 
The aye-aye has rodent-like teeth and a special thin middle finger to get at the insect grubs under tree bark. It fills the same ecological niche as woodpeckers do elsewhere. It taps on trees to find grubs, then gnaws holes in the wood using its forward slanting incisors. Then it sticks in its middle finger to pull the grubs out. 
Lemurs are primates, and so are related to monkeys, apes, and people.

<doc id="294760" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=294760" title="Grito de Dolores">
Grito de Dolores

The Grito de Dolores ("Cry of Dolores") was the call issued by Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Roman Catholic priest, on 16 September, 1810 in the small town of Dolores (Therefore the Grito "de Dolores"). It is also called the Grito de la Independencia or the Cry of Independence against the traditional Spanish Government, which had become catastrophically distorted by the Napoleonic invasion of the Peninsula in the preceding two years.
Hidalgo and a number of criollos were planning to fight the Spanish colonial government, but they were betrayed. 
Because he was afraid to get arrested, Hidalgo made his brother Mauricio and a number of other men with guns go to the sheriff. On the night of 15 September, they made the sheriff set free the pro-independence ("people wanting to rule their own land") prisoners. They set eighty free. 
The next morning, at around 6:00 am, Hidalgo ordered the church bells to be rung. He made his congregation ("people who attended his church") come together. With Ignacio Allende and Juan Aldama by his side, he spoke to the people in front of his church. He encouraged them to go against the Spanish government. Researchers do not agree as to what exactly Hidalgo said at the time. 
The Battle of Guanajuato, the first important fight in the war, happened 4 days later. Mexico's independence from Spain wouldn't be declared until September 27, 1821, after ten years of war. This happened with the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire.
Every year on the night of September 15 the President of Mexico rings the bell of the National Palace in Mexico City at around eleven in the evening. After the ringing of the bell, he repeats a cry of patriotism (a Grito Mexicano) based upon the "Grito de Dolores". He calls out the names of the important heroes of the Mexican War of Independence and ends with the shout of "Viva Mexico!" (three times) from the balcony of the palace. After the shouting, he rings the bell again and waves the Flag of Mexico to the applause of the crowd in the Plaza de la Constitución. This is followed by the playing and mass singing of the Himno Nacional Mexicano, the national anthem. On the morning of September 16, or Independence Day, the national military parade starts in the Zócalo (another name for the Plaza de la Constitución). It goes past the Hidalgo Memorial and ends on the Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City’s main boulevard. 
A similar celebration happens in cities and towns all over Mexico, and in Mexican embassies and consulates worldwide, on the 15th or the 16th. The mayor or governor, ambassadors or consuls will take on the role of the president, and ring the bells, give a speech and so on.
In the 19th century, Mexican presidents in their last year in office started to come to Dolores Hidalgo for the Grito de Dolores. President Calderón went to Dolores Hidalgo as part of the bicentennial celebrations in 2010 on the 16th of September.
September 16 is Independence Day in Mexico and is considered a patriotic holiday, or fiesta patria (literally, "holiday of the Fatherland"). This day is celebrated with parades, patriotic programs, drum and bugle and marching band competitions, and other special events.

Criollo (people)

The Criollos (singular: Criollo) were a social class in the caste system of the overseas colonies established by Spain in the 16th century, especially in Latin America. The name was used for people of pure or mostly Spanish blood, but who were born in the colony.
The "Criollo" class was seen as lower than the "Peninsulares". Peninsulares were the people who lived in the colony, but were born in Spain. Criollos were higher status/rank than all other castes. Examples of other castes are people of mixed descent, Amerindians, and enslaved Africans. 
The term Criollo is often translated into English as Creole. However, the word "creole" is also used for many ethnic groups around the world who have no historic connection to Spain or to any colonial system. 
Until 1760, the Spanish colonies were ruled under laws designed by the Spanish Habsburgs. They gave the American provinces great independence. The situation changed with the Bourbon Reforms during the reign of Charles III. 
Spain needed to get more money from its colonies for the European and global wars it was fighting so it could maintain the Spanish Empire. The Crown made the "Penisulares" more important, and they took over many administrative offices which had been filled by Criollos. At the same time, reforms by the Catholic Church reduced the roles and privileges of the lower ranks of the clergy, who were mostly Criollos.
By the 19th century, this unfair policy of the Spanish Crown and the examples of the American and French revolutions, led the Criollos to rebel against the "Peninsulares". With increasing support of the other castes, they started to fight Spain in for independence (1809–1826).

Grumman G-21 Goose

The Grumman G-21 Goose is an amphibious aircraft, which means it can land and take off on water. It was designed as an eight-seat "commuter" plane for businessmen in the Long Island area. The Goose was Grumman’s first monoplane to fly. It was also Grumman's first twin-engined aircraft as well as their first aircraft to provide commercial service. During World War II, the Goose was used to transport the US military (including the Coast Guard). It served with many other air forces. During battles, the Goose took on an increasing number of combat and training roles. It was also used after the war.
In 1936, some rich residents of Long Island, such as E. Roland Harriman, asked Grumman to build them an aircraft. They would use this aircraft to fly to New York City. The G-21 was designed after this. It was an all-metal, high-winged monoplane powered by two Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp Jr. nine-cylinder, air-cooled radial engines mounted on the leading edge of high-set wings. The deep fuselage served also as a hull and had hand-cranked retractable landing gear. First flight of the prototype took place on May 29, 1937.
The fuselage was very versatile. It had a lot of interior space. So it could be used as luxury or transport airliner. There were plans to market the G-21 as an amphibian airliner.

People from all over the world can use the same codes; this is helpful because different languages have different names for many countries. For example, the country English-speakers call "Spain" is called "España" by Spanish-speakers. The ISO 3166 has three codes for Spain: ES, ESP, and 724. No other country has any of these codes.

After Mexico achieved independence, the town was renamed "Dolores Hidalgo" in his honor. The central square of the town, in front of Father Hidalgo's historic church, is a popular tourist spot.
Today Dolores Hidalgo is known primarily for its ceramics industry. It givese work to well over half the city's population. The inexpensive and mass-produced ceramic products are sold throughout Latin America and the United States. 
Fans of ranchera and popular music visit Dolores Hidalgo for the tomb of José Alfredo Jiménez. He was one of the country's most beloved singers and songwriters. He is buried in the town cemetery.
Footballer Adolfo "El Bofo" Bautista was born here.

Password

A password is a way of authentication. It can be used as a means to identify a person. Since the password is the only way to identify a person, it has to be kept secret. A password can be static. This means it will remain the same unless the user changes it, or it rarely changes. Or a password can be dynamic. A dynamic password changes regularly and does not remain the same. One type of a dynamic password is a one-time pad that can only be used once. 
Passwords were first used in the military. This was to be able to tell who was a friend and who was an enemy when it was dark.
Modern passwords are made of characters, letters and numbers. Sometimes a password will require a minimum number of characters. Usually this is from six to eight. Some websites allow only the use of letters and numbers, but no other characters on the keyboard. Other websites advise using a combination of letters and numbers to increase the "strength" of a password. Websites also advise changing a password once a year or more often to prevent hacking. A person may be able to guess a password if it is too easy. While being typed, each letter of a password is shown as * or •. 
Other ways of verifying the identity of a person include using fingerprint scanners and face detection.

Jure Francetić

Jure Francetić (1912 - 1942) was an Ustashe Commissioner of Bosnia and Herzegovina, war criminal, responsible for the massacre of Bosnian Serbs and Jews.
Francetić was born in Otočac on July 3, 1912. After gymnasium (high school) he went to study law at the University of Zagreb, were he joined the Ustaša movement. Soon after, he was exiled from Zagreb for five years as a result of his anti-Yugoslav political activities. He stayed in Otočac for a short time before emigrating to Italy in March 1933. He took the Ustaša oath in the Borgotaro camp on April 24, 1933, and then spent the following four years in Austria, Italy and Hungary. In Hungary he joined to the Ustashe terrorist group camp at Jankapuszta, under new, conspirative name 'Laszlo'.
After the assassination of Alexander I of Yugoslavia he was interned on Sardinia by Mussolini at the request of the Yugoslav government. After a general declaration of amnesty in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Francetić returned to Croatia in November 1937, but was immediately arrested and exiled to his hometown. The next year Francetić returned to Zagreb hoping to complete his study of law but was forced to complete his military service instead. In late 1940 he was again arrested in Zagreb because of a congratulatory telegraph to Jozef Tiso, president of the newly formed Slovak Republic (1939–1945), signed by a number of Croat nationalists. He was again exiled to his native Otočac. After delivering an inflammatory nationalistic speech at a local school's New Year's celebration in Otočac on January 12, 1941, he escaped to Germany to avoid another arrest.
Francetić earned his only military education and officer rank while serving the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Army. He became a non-commissioned officer in the rank of sergeant. About Francetić's military experience and knowledge, his Ustashe superior Eugen Dido Kvaternik wrote: "He did not have basic military knowledge nor military education, nor did he have any talent for basic military organization.". After establishment of the Independent State of Croatia in April 1941 he and other 10 Ustašas organized the Black Legion (Croatian: Crna Legija). Jure Francetić became the leader of the Black Legion and earned the rank of colonel in the Ustaša army. Kvaternik believed that Francetić "a born guerrilla and a son of our mountainous Hercegovina" was the reason good enough to put him in the role of military leader in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In order to consolidate the Ustashe party power, much of the party work in the province he put in the hands of Catholic priests. Francetić's Ustashe took control over the local administration by dismissing all civil servants and teachers belonging to the category of "Srbijanci", as well as those who were Jews. Killings, arrests, and deportation of Serbs and Jews was a regular duty of Francetić's henchmen - based and justified by the official Ustashe policy which demanded total extermination of Jews and murder, expulsion, and conversion to the Roman Catholicism of Serb population in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Francetić participated personally in arresting and interrogations of prominent Serbian and Jewish leaders (Vaso Miskin, Albahari) and ordered the murders of some of them. He even turned his own Sarajevo apartment into the prison kitchen and laundry room.
Justification for the slaughter of Bosnian Serbs and Jews Francetic found in " the propaganda of 'the Jewish communist hydra' had succeeded in misleading a majority of the Serb Orthodox population in eastern Bosnia into committing 'criminal acts against the state' "and concluded that "the 'most drastic means' would have to be employed against them."
Ustashe's unseen cruelty and savagery applied against Serbs and Jews even prompted the German command to demand that Francetić, as the commander of the 1st Brigade Black Legion, be dismissed. Pavelić defied and promoted Francetić to commander of all Ustashe field formations. In the pre-war times about 15,000 Jews lived in Bosnia and Herzegovina. About 3,000 women and children of this number - were arrested and kept in Kruschnitze concentration camp (Bosnia). Later they will be deported to Jasenovac and Stara Gradiska concentration camps. Additional 7,000 Bosnian Jews will be deported directly to Jasenovac concentration camp.
Francetić died on December 27 or 28, 1942. While flying to Gospić on December 22, his plane was downed by Yugoslav Partisans near the village of Močile, near Slunj, which was the Partisan-held area. Both he and his pilot were immediately captured by Partisan village guards and peasants and Francetić received numerous blows with pitchforks. Severely wounded, he was taken to NOVJ General Staff Hospital where Partisan surgeons attempted to save his life in order to exchange him for inmates of Ustaše camps and prisons, but failed.
Ustashe authorities were so concerned about the effect of his death would have on supporters of their movement that the news of his death was delayed until the beginning of March 1943. Official announcement of his death came on March 31, 1943., when Ustashe declared eight days of official mourning.
Memorial plaque to this Ustashe leader was erected in Slunj (in June 2000, by Ustashe's Association of war veterans, "Hrvatski domobran") as an embrace, by those responsible, of the NDH and ethnic hatred.
In late 2004 the Croatian government ordered the removal of the memorial plaque in Slunj.
"In January 2005 in the outskirts of Split, unknown persons erected overnight a memorial to Francetic and Budak-to show the extreme right's anger at Sanader's betrayal of the Ustasha cause and the prime minister's cooperation with ICTY"

Rock cycle

The rock cycle is the process by which rocks of one kind change into rocks of another kind. 
There are three main kinds of rocks: igneous rock, metamorphic rock, and sedimentary rock. Each of these rocks can change into the other kinds by physical processes: cooling, melting, heat, weathering/erosion, compacting (squeezing tightly together), cementing, and pressure. 
Two other substances also can become rocks and enter the rock cycle. When heated deep under ground, rocks become magma (liquid rock). Above ground, it is called lava. Sediment, the particles from rock erosion and weathering, is the basis for sedimentary rock of the future.
Igneous rock is hardened magma, which can happen above or below ground. It can melt into magma, erode into sediment, or be pressed tightly together to become metamorphic.
Metamorphic rock is igneous or sedimentary rock that has been heated and squeezed. It can erode into sediment or melt into magma. It formed under extreme pressure and temperature deep inside mountain chains.
Sedimentary rock is compacted sediment which can come from any of the other rocks, plus remains of living things. It can erode back into sediment, or be pressurized into metamorphic rock. 
These processes can occur in different orders, and the cycle goes on forever. Earth has several processes for changing rocks. Wind and water can create sediment from rocks, and movement of one tectonic plate against another creates enormous heat and pressure which affects rocks greatly. Subduction converts all kinds into magma, which eventually rejoins the cycle as igneous rock.

Twicket

Twicket was a village cricket match. It was shown live on the Internet. It could be watched form anywhere on the world. That happened on Easter Monday, 25 April 2011. The organisers did that to show that very fast broadband is useful. Very fast broadband helps community groups to upload content to the web. The organisers says Twicket was the first village cricket match ever to be streamed online.
Twicket is a made up word. The "Tw" is from Twitter. The "icket" is from Cricket.
There were reports about Twicket on BBC television news, on BBC Radio London, on TalkSport, and on Radio New Zealand.
It was written about by "The Guardian", and "Metro".
It was mentioned on Twitter by Stephen Fry, the BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones and Jonathan Agnew. Agnew is the BBC's cricket correspondent.
John Popham is a consultant. He decided to show Twicket online after seeing two comments on Twitter. In the first comment, Dan Slee said he wanted to see news about his a local village cricket team on Twitter.
Then, Chris Conder mentioned that she was testing a new 30Mbps, symmetrical internet connection. "Symmetrical internet" means that the upload speed is as fast as the download speed. Conder lives in a village called Wray. Wray is in Lancashire, England. The connection was installed in Wray by Lancaster University Wray is one of only three villages in the UK to have a symmetrical community network.
Conder told Popham that a special cricket match was going to be played in Wray. The match was part of the village’s Scarecrow Festival. The Scarecrow Festival happens every year. The match was between Wray and a team called "The Rest of the World".
Popham said:
I'm confident we can do this, because the village Wi-Fi has a 30Mbps upload speed ... It's a bit of fun, but it has a serious purpose too. The serious side is to demonstrate that it can be done, it possible to live broadcast events like this using relatively cheap equipment and a good internet connection. It will also demonstrate the importance of good internet connectivity in rural areas, and the need for fast connections if we are to realise the aspiration to use the internet to enable more people to produce their own content.
The match was 20 overs per side. This is called the Twenty20 format. There was an extra rule that said that any batsman who scored 20 runs had to retire. Wray won the toss. They decided to bowl first. After 20 overs, The Rest of the World had scored 69 runs and lost 5 wickets. That meant that Wray needed 70 runs off 20 overs. Wray managed to do that. Their final runs were a six. Wray won in their eleventh over. They won by 8 wickets.
After the cricket match, there was a tug o'war contest. It was also streamed live. The rest of the world won. Interviews with some of the cricket players and other people were also shown on the internet.
The event was streamed on a website called Bambuser. Technical support was provided by a company from Birmingham called Aquila TV. Aquila used two Sony Z1 cameras and a DSR 350 camera. The most people watching at once was 2,733.
A separate sound-only commentary was broadcast on-line, by Radio Youthology. Radio Youthology are also from Birmingham. 1,780 people listened to the Radio Youthology commentary. That was Radio Youthology's biggest audience ever.
A BBC North West television news crew also went to the match. They made a short film. It was broadcast the same evening.
The hashtag for the event was #twicket. It was trending on Twitter just before the end of the match.

The Mexican War of Independence (1810–1821) was a war between the people of Mexico and the Spanish colonial government. It started on 16 September 1810. It was started by Mexican-born Spaniards ("criollo people"), Mestizos and Amerindians who wanted independence from Spain. 
The idea of a Mexican independence goes back to the years after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. Martín Cortés led a revolt against the Spanish colonial government.
After the plot called the "Conspiracy of the Machetes" was not successful in 1799, the War of Independence really started with the Grito de Dolores in 1810 when Spain was fighting against its French invaders
Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, was a Mexican priest and member of a group of educated "Criollos" in Querétaro. They met in "tertulias" (salons), and decided in 1810 that a revolt against the colonial government was needed, because of the results of the Peninsular War. Hidalgo worked closely with Ignacio de Allende, a nobleman with military training, the plan was for a battle in December 1810.
They were betrayed by a member of the group. Hidalgo then turned to his parishioners in the town of Dolores. Around 6:00 am of September 16, 1810 he declared independence from the Spanish crown, and war against the government in what was known as the "Grito de Dolores". The revolutionary army decided to fight for independence. They marched on to Guanajuato, which was a major colonial mining centre governed by Spaniards and criollos. 
There, the leaders of this "citizens army", which was more like an unorganised mob, locked themselves in the granary ("place for storing grain"). They killed most of the much hated Spaniards and Criollos that were there. This also included high-ranking nobles and supporters of the fight for Independence. This caused Hidalgo and Allende to fight with each other. After that, Allende did not want to fight alongside Hidalgo, and left with his soldiers.
On October 30, Miguel Hidalgo's army fought the Spanish resistance at the Battle of Monte de las Cruces. They won this battle. 
In January 1811, Spanish forces fought the Battle of the Bridge of Calderón and the peasant army lost. It made the rebels flee towards the United States-Mexican border, where they hoped to escape. However they were caught by the Spanish army. 
Hidalgo and what was left of his army were caught in the state of Coahuila at the Wells of Baján. He had a trial done by the Inquisition on 30 July 1811. He was executed.
After the death of Father Hidalgo, the leadership of the revolutionary army was taken over by José María Morelos. Under his leadership the cities of Oaxaca and Acapulco were taken. In 1813, the Congress of Chilpancingo had their first meeting. On 6 November of that year, the Congress signed the first official document of independence, known as the "Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America". It was followed by a long war at the Siege of Cuautla. In 1815, Morelos was caught by Spanish colonial authorities. He was put on trial and executed for treason in San Cristóbal Ecatepec on 22 December. 
By the early 1820's the independence movement was close to collapsing. Two of their main leaders were executed, and the rebels found it hard to fight the well-organized Spanish military. Also, many of the most influential criollos did not care any more. The violence of Hidalgo's and Morelos's unorganised army mob was not liked. They wanted a better, less bloody way to get independence. 
In December 1820, Viceroy Juan Ruiz de Apodaca sent a force led by a royalist criollo officer, Colonel Agustín de Iturbide, to fight in Oaxaca. Iturbide was famous for the way in which he went after Hidalgo's and Morelos's rebels during the early independence struggle. 
The fight at Oaxaca came at the same time as successful coup ("a fight by the military against the government") in Spain against the monarchy of Ferdinand VII. Ferdinand was forced to reinstate the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812. When this news reached Mexico, Iturbide saw it as an opportunity for the criollos to gain control of Mexico. After first clashing with Guerrero's forces, Iturbide switched sides. He invited the rebel leader to meet and discuss a new independence struggle.
While in the town of Iguala, Iturbide created three rules, or "guarantees," for Mexican independence from Spain.
He made his troops accept these rules. They are known as the Plan of Iguala. Iturbide then persuaded Guerrero to join his forces in support of the new independence. A new army, the Army of the Three Guarantees, was then placed under Iturbide's command to enforce the Plan of Iguala. The plan was so broad that it pleased both patriots and loyalists. The goal of independence and the protection of Roman Catholicism brought together all factions.
Iturbide's army was joined by rebel forces from all over Mexico. When the rebels' victory became certain, the viceroy resigned. On August 24, 1821, representatives of the Spanish crown and Iturbide signed the Treaty of Córdoba. This recognized Mexican independence under the terms of the "Plan of Iguala". 
On September 27 the Army of the Three Guarantees entered Mexico City. The next day Iturbide proclaimed the independence of the Mexican Empire. 
On the night of the May 18, 1822, a mass of people marched through the streets. They demanded that their commander-in-chief Iturbide accept the throne. The next day, the congress declared Iturbide emperor of Mexico.

<doc id="294966" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=294966" title="Plausible deniability">
Plausible deniability

Plausible deniability are words first used by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the Kennedy administration. In that case it meant not to tell senior government officials about illegal CIA activities. These officials could then defend themselves if the activities were discovered. They would be able to say quite plausibly, and perhaps truthfully, that they did not know anything about it (deniability). It meant that actions of the CIA could not be blamed on the President of the USA.
The concept is tied up with the idea of a "paper trail", whereby journalists find evidence of orders or discussions between senior officials and agents doing the forbidden acts. Interceptions of phone messages or e-mail messages may also be evidence of wrongdoing by officials. If there is no definite evidence of wrongdoing by an official, then his/her denial can be taken as sincere. The denial is "plausible" (or, at least, "might" be true). That achieves one of the main goals of public relations: for officials at least not to be caught red-handed doing something illegal. The effect of officials being caught red-handed can be extremely serious: see Watergate scandal.
Plausible deniability refers to the denial of blame in (formal or informal) chains of command. Senior people may give indirect and vague orders. For example, Henry II "Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?" or even less direct "Someone should do something about that". The intended message is understood. Later, when the deed is done, the higher man can say "I never intended that to happen". 
Plausible deniability is achieved when no records are kept of any instructions. It becomes impossible to find out who was responsible for the actions taken. If these activities become public, high-ranking officials may deny any knowledge of such act or any connection to the people used to carry out such acts. It usually means that it has been planned in advance, setting up the conditions to avoid responsibility for future actions or knowledge.

Only from 1938 to 1945 it was suspended, because Austria was a part of Nazigermany. Also from 1950 till 1958 there was no competition because the ÖFB was not interested in.

An airstone can be used in an aquarium (a tank or container for keeping fish) or a tank of water where plants are growing in a hydroponics system.The airstone is used to blow bubbles into water to increase the amount of oxygen in the water. The stone may have very small holes to make fine bubbles or it may have bigger holes to make larger bubbles.

Vermiculite

Vermiculite is a phyllosilicate mineral that is dug out of the ground in China, South Africa, Russia and Brazil. When it is dug from the ground it is a hard rock. Vermiculite gets bigger when it is heated and changes into a material that looks like worms. This was first done in the United States of America in the year 1824.
When Vermiculite has changed into small grains it is a very good material for insulation and is used to stop the escape of heat in things like ovens, furnaces and houses in cold countries. It is also very good at holding water so it is used in the soil of plants in pots and helping to grow seeds.
Because the Vermiculite grains are spongy (they can be pressed flat and then they open again) but not hard they are used inside cases or boxes to protect articles from breakage when they are being transported.
Vermiculite is also used in hydroponics as a material for the roots of plants to hold on to.
Because it does not burn Vermiculite is used with other materials in fillings in walls or ceilings (the roof of a room) to stop the spread of fire.
Although vermiculite is not a form of asbestos, it is often contaminated with asbestos. Any vermiculite insulation found in a building should be treated as containing asbestos until confirmed otherwise by a laboratory.

Peter Le Lievre

Peter Le Lievre (1812 – 1878) was a Guernsey Artist, Wine Merchant and Militia Officer.
Peter Le Lievre was educated at Elizabeth College, he never married and lived all his life at 17 Hauteville, St Peter Port with his two sisters.
Although known today as an artist Le Lievre was better known in his day as a businessman, and as the Lt Col of the Artillery Regiment in the Guernsey Militia. He did however design two lighthouses for St Peter Port harbour, and some of his works were published in his lifetime. It was only after the death of his sister Mary in 1904 that his works were exhibited publicly. His work has gained in popularity since then. In June 2010 a Blue Plaque to commemorate his life was unveiled at 17 Hauteville.

Blue plaque

The Blue Plaque is a scheme for remembering the links between famous people and buildings by placing commemorative plaques on the walls. The scheme was started by the Royal Society of Arts in London, and the very first plaques was, in fact, of red terracotta placed on the outside of a former home of Lord Byron (since demolished). 
The Society erected 36 plaques between 1866 - 1901, responsibility for them was transferred to the London County Council (1901-65) (which changed the colour of the plaques to the current blue) and later the Greater London Council (1965-86) and most recently English Heritage. Similar schemes are now operated in all the member countries of the United Kingdom. 
English Heritage looks after the Blue plaque scheme in the London Boroughs. Similar schemes exist outside London, run by each local authority. The system has been adopted outside the United Kingdom too, for example, in June 2010 a Blue Plaque was put on the home of Guernsey artist Peter Le Lievre.

Denial Bay, South Australia

Denial Bay is the name for both a small bay on the coast of South Australia, and a small fishing town built at the bay. The bay was named by explorer Matthew Flinders on 7 February 1802. Flinders had hoped that bay was bigger and would have provided better access into the inland of South Australia. One of the first European settlers was a sheep farmer, William McKenzie, who built a house in the area in 1889. The town was known as Mac's Town, and in 1910 the government officially named it McKenzie. In 1940 it was named Denial Bay.

Burhou

Burhou (pronounced bu-ROO) is a small island approximately northwest of Alderney that is part of the Channel Islands. No one lives on Burhou, and it is a bird sanctuary, so landing there is banned from 15 March to 27 July. The island's wildlife includes a colony of puffins (declining in numbers) and large numbers of rabbits.
It has no landing stage as such, but visitors use a small inlet. In rough weather it may be impossible to land.
The Guernsey botanist E.D. Marquand called it, "the most desolate and lonely of all the islands in our archipelago." He had to spend the night there, as his return journey was delayed by fog.
The 1906 book, "The Channel Pilot" states -
The States of Alderney member, John Beaman has political responsibility for the island.
Burhou, like many other Channel Islands (e.g. Lihou, Jethou), has the Norman suffix "-hou", meaning a small island, from the Old Norse "holmr". According to Dr. S.K. Kellet-Smith, "bur" refers to a storehouse - "Burhou is just the place where a fisherman would place a depository for his gear".
Signs of human occupation/visitation are much older. Flint flakes have been found on the island, and one is currently in the Alderney Museum. In 1847, F.C. Lukis found two standing stones, but these have since been lost, according to the archaeologist David Johnston.
According to the Assize Roll of the 14th century, Burhou was a rabbit warren, and a refuge for fishermen. This would have meant that there would have been some kind of shelter there, as it would be difficult for the fishermen to take refuge without it.
A hut was built on the island in 1820 as a shelter for fishermen and sailors at the instigation of General Le Mesurier (The Governor), but was destroyed during the German occupation of the Channel Islands (the Nazis used it for target practice during WWII). The hut was replaced in 1953, with basic accommodation which is rented out to visitors by Alderney Harbour Office.
Attempts have been made to raise sheep there. In 1900, a French couple lived there for a year. The soil is thin, and spray often goes right over the island, so the soil is very salty. The island has no fresh water supply for much of the year, and has to rely on shipments, or formerly tanks.
The island's animals are mainly birds, although rabbits are long established here. The island has many puffins and some storm petrels. Although the latter have declined, they used to nest in the cottage's storm loft. Roderick Dobson in "Birds of the Channel Islands" said that puffins had been plentiful for over a century. The "Birds of Guernsey" (1878) by Cecil Smith states likewise. The puffins have had to compete with gulls, and in 1949, hundreds died from red mite infestation. The rabbit holes on the island make good nesting for them.
Amongst the plants noted here are sea spurry, forget-me-nots, scarlet pimpernel, field bugloss, bracken and nettles. E.D. Marquand counted 18 species of plant here in 1909, but by the late twentieth century Frances Le Sueur and David McClintock found 45, which they wrote up in the "Transactions of La Société Guernesiaise"

Something that oscillates is something that "vibrates", or repeats the same pattern. Many things in nature move back-and-forth or up-and down when pushed or struck. In time, natural oscillators slow down and stop because of friction.

<doc id="295073" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295073" title="Ortac">
Ortac

Ortac is a small uninhabited islet about 5 km West of the coast of Alderney near to the islet of Burhou. It measures about 50 by 70 metres (160 by 230 ft).
A.H. Ewen thinks that the rock's name meant "large rock at the edge" from the Norman language "Or" (edge) + "Etac" (Stack). Alexander Deschamps said that the French used to call it "the Eagle's Nest".
Ortac and Alderney, along with the Casquets, are part of the same sandstone ridge.
Paul Naftel, a Guernsey artist, drew Ortac, and the drawing appeared in Ansted & Latham's book, "The Channel Islands" (1862). The writers themselves commented -
If the sea bottom, which is in very few parts as much as 20 fathoms deep, were elevated 120 feet (37 m), the island of Alderney, the Burhou and Ortac group, and the Casquets would be connected by low land, and form a narrow island around 12 miles (19 km) long.
The 1906 book, "The Channel Pilot" states -
Between Ortac, Verte Tête and Burhou Island, are scattered many dangerous rocks, and ledges among which the streams run with great velocity.
It also supposedly contains a cave known as "the Oven".
Victor Hugo, who lived on Guernsey, and who wrote much about the Channel Islands says in his novel, "The Laughing Man" ("L'Homme qui Rit"):
"...on the port bow arose, standing stark, cut out on the background of mist, a tall opaque mass, vertical, right-angled, a tower of the abyss. It was the Ortac rock. The Ortac, all of a piece, rises up in a straight line to eighty feet above the angry beating of the waves... An immovable cliff, it plunges its rectilinear planes apeak into the numberless serpentine coils of the sea. At night it stands an enormous block, resting on the folds of a huge black sheet. In time of storm it awaits the stroke of the axe which is 'the thunderclap'...""To be wrecked on the Casquets is to be cut into ribbons; to strike on the Ortac is to be crushed into powder... On a straight frontage, such of that of the Ortac, neither the wave nor the cannon ball can ricochet... if the wave carries the vessel on the rock she breaks on it, and is lost..."
Meanwhile, in another work, "The Toilers of the Sea" ("Les Travailleurs de la mer"), he mentions the curious anecdote that Ortac was inhabited by Saint Malo:
"The Norman fishermen who frequent the Channel have many precautions to take at sea, by reason of the illusions with which Satan environs them. It has long been an article of popular faith that Saint Maclou inhabited the great square rock called Ortac, in the sea between Alderney and the Casquets; and many old sailors used to declare that they had often seen him there, seated and reading a book. Accordingly the sailors, as they passed, were in the habit of kneeling many times before the Ortac rock, until the day when the fable was destroyed, and the truth took its place. For it has been discovered, and is now well established, that the lonely inhabitant Of the rock is not a saint, but a devil. This evil spirit, whose name is Jochmus, had the impudence to pass himself of; for many centuries as Saint Maclou. Even the Church herself is not proof against snares of this kind. The demons Ragubel, Oribel, and Tobiel were regarded as saints until the year 745, when Pope Zachary, having at length exposed them, turned them out of saintly company. This sort of weeding of the saintly calendar is certainly very useful; but it can only be practiced by very accomplished judges of devils and their ways."
Ortac is noted for its large gannet colony. This is of fairly recent origin. On 19 June 1940, Major J.A.A. Wallace was preparing for the evacuation of Alderney, and went there to inspect the kittiwake colony. He found only one gannet. He found none on Les Etacs off Alderney. Now both swarm with the birds.
In 1979, a mission with two naval helicopters was launched to remove nets and rubbish used in nests and which were trapped.
Romeo 41 is an Airway over the English Channel from the Channel Islands Control Area to the Solent Control Area. There is a reporting point named ORTAC at southern boundary between Romeo 41 and the Channel Islands Control Zone. Its position is 49° 59' 57N, 2° 0' 18W, which is about 30 miles north-north-east of Alderney. This is not coincident with the islet named Ortac, but its name is undoubtedly derived from the islet. 
Many Standard Instrument Approach and Departure Procedures into Channel Islands airports use ORTAC as part of the procedure. A typical clearance for an Aurigny flight from Alderney to Southampton will read as follows:
"Ayline 123: your clearance is to the Northern Zone boundary via ORTAC, on track Romeo 41."

2011 Libyan civil war

The Libyan Civil War was a civil war in Libya during the year 2011. It began in the middle of February 2011. Many Libyans were inspired by the uprisings in neighbouring countries, such as Tunisia and Egypt. They violently protested against the government. Colonel Muammar Gaddafi sent troops and tanks to break up the rebellion. Al-quaeda started bombing. and rebels began forming their own government. The war led to the death of Quadaffi in October, and of thousands of other people.
The conflict began with series of demonstrations and riots. There were many small protests of about 300-500 people throughout January. Major protests did not begin until 14 February 2011. The demonstrations were protesting against the Government of Libya and its leader Muammar al-Gaddafi. The conflict grew as thousands of people joined the protests. Gaddafi vowed to hunt them down and "clean Libya house by house" until all rebels are gone. However, some of Gaddafi's soldiers began joining the rebels in protest. The protests are thought to have been inspired by the successful uprising in Tunisia and Egypt.
According to NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent, Richard Engel, who entered Libya and had reached the city of Tobruk on 22 February 2011 was quoted as saying, "the protest movement is no longer a protest movement, it's a war. It's open revolt." and on 22 February, "The Economist" described the protests as an "uprising that is trying to reclaim Libya from the world's longest-ruling autocrat". On 21 February, the Libyan Air Force aircraft attacked civilian protesters in Tripoli which caused international condemnation. By this time, over 300 to 2,000 were dead and over 5,000 were injured.
There were small battles until February 24, when Gaddafi sent tanks and troops into Misrata and attacked. Then, on March 6, launched a counter-offensive against Rebels. This lasted until 12 March. He regained Ra's Lanuf and Brega. The Rebels gained power when NATO and other countries began bombarding Gaddafi's forces with attack aircraft.
The Rebels' launched a counter-offensive on March 27 that lasted until April 1. The Rebels regained a few cities.
The Battle of Misrata was the fiercest battle in the civil war. The Hamza Brigade fought for Gaddafi against the Rebels from 24 February to 12 March. The Khamis Brigade, run by Gaddafi's son Khamis, rolled in and nearly destroyed the entire city. The rebels won the battle and took control of the city. 
The rebels also won in Benghazi and other places. They took Tripoli in August. In October the fighting diminished, and the rebels declared victory. His enemies killed Qaddafi on 20 October 2011.

Jackson County, Florida

Jackson County is a county in the U.S. state of Florida. The population as of the 2000 census was 46,755. As of 2005, 48,985 people lived there. Its county seat is Marianna, Florida.
Jackson County was created by the Florida Territorial Council in 1822 by splitting from Escambia County, making it the third county in the Territory. The county was named for Andrew Jackson, who had served as Florida's first military governor for six months in 1821. Jackson County originally spread from the Choctawhatchee River on the west to the Suwannee River on the east. The county had been shrunk close to its current boundaries by 1840 through the creation of new counties from its original land. Small changes to the county border continued through most of the 19th century, however.
There were no towns in Jackson County when it was formed. The first county court met at what was called "Robinson's Big Spring" (later called Blue Springs) in 1822 and then at the "Big Spring of the Choctawhatchee" in 1823. The following year the county court met at "Chipola Settlement" which is also known as Waddell's Mill Pond.
Marianna became the county seat, but not without controversy. It was founded by Robert Beveridge, a native of Scotland, in September 1827. The first town established in Jackson County was Webbville in January 1827. Webbville, a community of land squatters, was located northwest of present day Marianna and was named the county seat. Webbville thrived until 1828 when Beveridge and other Marianna settlers went to Tallahassee and enticed the Florida Legislature with free land, construction of a courthouse, a public square and $500 to purchase a quarter section of land to be sold at public auction as a way to finance the new government, if the county seat was moved to Marianna.
Beveridge and his supporters succeeded and Marianna became the county seat of the county justice and civil authority, even though it was never officially named the county seat. Marianna began to grow and prosper when the county government moved into the new courthouse in 1829. Webbville's important citizens moved to Marianna and the L&N Railroad decided to bypass the town. 
From 1869-71, Jackson County was the center of a low-level guerrilla war known as the Jackson County War. Ku Klux Klan members, including Confederate Army veterans, assassinated over 150 Republican Party officials and important African-Americans as part of a successful campaign to retain conservative white Democratic power.
According to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of , of which (or 95.92%) is land and (or 4.08%) is water. Jackson County is the only county in Florida that borders both Georgia and Alabama. Jackson County is in the Central Standard Time Zone. Its eastern border with Gadsden County forms the boundary in this area between the Central Standard and Eastern Standard Time Zones.
As of the census of 2000, there were 46,755 people, 16,620 households, and 11,600 families living in the county. The population density was 51 people per square mile (20/km²).

<doc id="295204" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295204" title="Battle of Passchendaele">
Battle of Passchendaele

The Battle of Passchendaele was one of the biggest battles of the First World War. It happened between July and November 1917. Allied troops attacked the German Army in many operations. The Allies were commanded by British leaders. The battle was fought for control of a village named Passchendaele. Passchendaele is near the town of Ypres in West Flanders, Belgium. The purpose of the battle was to "wear out the enemy" and "to secure the Belgian coast and connect with the Dutch front lines". The British commander was Douglas Haig. He planned the battle in three parts. These were capturing Passchendaele Ridge, moving to capture Roeselare, and Operation Hush. In Operation Hush, marines were to land somewhere on the Belgian coast and there would be a breakout attack from Nieuwpoort and the Yser bridgehead. 
The British launched many massive attacks. They were helped a lot by artillery, aircraft and sometimes tanks. The British did not win. This is because they were up against a large and modern German defence. The British and French armies eventually became tactically better, and came close to winning later in the year.
The battle was made up of 'bite and hold' attacks. This captured ground that could be useful. It also wore down the German army with attacks and counter-attacks by the German army to stop the Allied attacks and take back ground. It lasted until the Canadian Corps captured Passchendaele on 6 November 1917. The battle ended on 10 November, apart from small operations. Causing huge casualties for the Germans, the Allies had captured 5 miles (8 km) of some of the best defended territory in the world. They lost 140,000 men. This is a ratio of about 2 inches (5 cm) of ground taken by every dead soldier. The Germans took back the lost ground when the line was shortened five months later, during the Battle of the Lys, losing it forever on 28 September 1918.
Passchendaele has become popular with the misery of grinding attrition warfare. This type of warfare was often fought in thick mud. The land between Dixmude and the river Lys was crossed by streams and ditches that were used for drainage. Most of these flowed west, moving towards the Ypres—Commines canal which went north-south. The land was flat and swampy but for good drainage. August 1917 was very cold and wet. This was not usual. Very big artillery strikes had also destroyed the ground surface. There were times where it was dry. It was most dry in September, but mud was still in parts of the battlefield. Tanks got stuck in mud and some soldiers and horses drowned in it. 
Ridges went in a curve pattern from south of Ypres, east then north to Passchendaele and Staden. They were sixty metres high at the most. This high ground had been fought over a lot since 1914.
Many historians have different opinions on this battle. Most of this debate is in Britain. The volume of the British Official History of the War that wrote about the Battle of Passchendaele was the last ever published. Some people say that it was written to make Field Marshal Douglas Haig look better, and to make General Hubert Gough, the commander of the Fifth Army, look worse. The many dead and injured men the British Army had only to capture a very small amount of land have made many historians follow the example of David Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister at the time, and use it as an example of wasting soldiers and being a bad leader. Lloyd George, who was almost certainly affected by Basil Liddell Hart, wrote 100 pages of memoires to a review of British generalship at Third Ypres.
There is also a revisionist way of thinking which tries to say that the British Army did well in the battle. Revisionists say that the British caused many casualties in the German Army, helped the French and came up with attack tactics which could win against German defences. These tactics made the Germans want winter to come badly. Revisionists say that these things were important in winning the war in 1918.
Death and injury amounts for the battle are still not decided on. Some people say that the Allies suffered much heavier losses than the Germans. Others say different things. However, nobody says that hundreds of thousands of soldiers on both sides were not killed or hurt. The last survivor of the battle, who was also the last survivor of the Western Front in the United Kingdom, Private Harry Patch, died on 25 July 2009.

New World monkey

New World monkeys are the families of primates which are found in Central and South America. The families are ranked together as the Ceboidea superfamily, the only living platyrrhine superfamily. They differ from the Old World monkeys and apes, which are Catarrhini.
About 40 million years ago, the simians split into the groups: the Platyrrhini (New World monkeys) and Catarrhini (apes and Old World monkeys). The key question is how did the early monkeys get to the Americas? There is at present no evidence for either of the two possible routes. Route one is across the then less wide Atlantic. Route two is across Asia, across the Behring Strait, and down through North America.
There are some big differences between the two groups of monkeys. New World monkeys have noses of flatter shape with nostrils facing to the side. Most do not have full colour vision, they have a different dental formula, many form monogamous pair bonds, with paternal care for the young, mostly, twin births are common, their thumbs are not opposable, and so on.

Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan

The current Chairman (presiding officer) of the Senate of Pakistan is Farooq Naek since 12 March, 2009.
The first Chairman of the Senate was Justice Khan Habibullah Khan.
The main purpose for the creation of the Senate of Pakistan was to give equal representation to all the federating units since the membership of the National Assembly was based on the population of each province. Equal provincial membership in the Senate, thus, balances the provincial inequality in the National Assembly and dispels doubts and apprehension, if any, regarding deprivation and exploitation.
The role of the Senate is to promote national cohesion and harmony and to alleviate fears of the smaller provinces regarding domination by any one province because of its majority, in the National Assembly.
The Senate is a body that represents the provinces and territories of the country and promotes a feeling of equality, peace and good understanding between them, which is so essential for the growth and prosperity of a nation. Thus, the Senate in Pakistan, over the years, has emerged as an essential organ and a stabilizing factor of the federation.
a) President and Parliament: Under Article 50 of the Constitution, the Majlis-i-Shoora (Parliament) of Pakistan consists of the President and two Houses to be known respectively as the National Assembly and the Senate. 
The President is elected by members of both Houses of the Parliament and the Provincial Assemblies. The President may be removed from office or impeached through a resolution, passed by not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Parliament in a joint sitting of the two Houses, convened for the purpose. 
The Constitution empowers the President to dissolve the National Assembly in his discretion if a situation has arisen in which the Government of the Federation cannot be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and an appeal to the electorate is necessary. However, the Senate is not subject to dissolution. 
In case the office of the President becomes vacant for any reason, the Chairman, or if he is unable to perform the functions of the office of the President, the Speaker, acts as President till such time that a President is elected. Same is the case when the President by reason of absence from Pakistan or any other cause is unable to perform his functions. 
b) Relations between the Houses: Unless both the Houses pass a Bill and it receives President's assent it cannot become a law except in the case of a money bill which is the sole prerogative of the National Assembly. Under the Legal Framework Order, 2002, the role of a Mediation Committee, comprising eight members from each House, has been introduced for the first time to evolve consensus on Bills, in case there is a disagreement between the two Houses. 
c) Cabinet: The Constitution provides that there shall be a Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister which is collectively responsible to the National Assembly. The Prime Minister is chosen from the National Assembly. 
The Federal Ministers and Ministers of State are appointed from amongst the members of Parliament. However, the number of Federal Ministers and Ministers of State who are members of Senate, shall not at any time, exceed one fourth of the numbers of Federal Ministers.

This area of Florida is southern culturally, with the Deep South culture reaching to Levy County with the lower southern end (Pasco, Hernando, and sometimes Citrus county) often considered part of the Tampa Bay Metropolian Area. Pasco County is sometimes considered part of the Sun Coast.
The history of the name "The Nature Coast" goes back to 1991 as part of a marketing campaign to attract vacationing people to the nine county area, the name "Nature Coast" caught on quickly and describes the area previously known as the "Big Bend" of Florida.

Digital forensics

Digital forensics is a forensic science where experts look at computer devices to help solve crime. It can also include mobile phones. The experts who do digital forensics are often called "analysts" or "investigators". When an expert is asked to look at a computer it is called an "investigation".
A digital forensics investigation happens when someone is blamed for a crime that includes using a computer. The expert will look for evidence about the crime. They will try to prove whether the person is to blame or not.
Sometimes investigations are used in disputes between companies and/or people (known as civil law). These may not involve a crime. Instead the expert is asked to find out information about a person or company by looking at their computer. There is a specific word used to describe this type of investigation, it is "eDiscovery".
Another use of digital forensics is called "intrusion detection". It happens after a hacker breaks in to a computer network. After the break in an expert is often asked to look at the networked computers to try and find out how it happened.

Freddy vs. Jason

Freddy vs. Jason is an 2003 American horror movie. Many of the fans from both of the horror movie characters thought the movie was a great battle movie between the two killers. It was a cross-over between "Jason Goes to Hell".
The movie is about Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) and Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger) terrorizing Elm Street and killing the teenagers who live or dare to cross paths between Jason or Freddy. It wasn't until that Freddy begins to try to kill all of the teens, but Jason keeps cathing up to him which makes both of them angry. Then Lori Campbell (Monica Keena) is wondering how her mother died in which she once thought died from a car crash. Later, Will Rollins (Jason Ritter) and Mark Davis (Brendan Fletcher) escape from a mentaly-ill hospital and tries to save Lori and her friends from Freedy.
It wasn't until they needed some more pills to keep them awake, so they go to the asylum from where Will and Mark escaped from and try to find the pills. Then Bill Freeburg (Kyle Labine dump all the pills in the sink when he was possessed by Freedy. Then Jason came crashing into the asylum and then was put to sleep by Bill, but was sliced in half. When Jason was asleep, he was dreaming about seeing his mother and then Freddy came along and stabbed him in the head. Then Lori went to the same dream as Jason was, but then he woke-up and then the van they were driving crashed into Camp Crystal Lake. Later Lori, Will, Kia Waterson (Kelly Rowland), and Charlie Linderman (Chris Marquette) went into a cabin, but Lori was in a nightmare with Freddy. Later Jason came into the cabin which he set on fire. Then Lori pulled Freddy into the real world from were Freddy and Jason began to fight.
Later, they were pushed into the dock from the lake and then Jason began to slice Freddy until he cut Jason's fingers and Freddy got the machete and began to stab Jason and then stabbed his eyes with his razor gloves. After Jason killed both Kia and Charlie, Lori and Will lit the propane tank on fire and caused the camp to explode. That was when Jason tore Freddy's arm off and were blown into the lake. Then Will and Lori were about to leave until Freddy came back with Jason's machete and was about to kill them until Jason stabbed Freddy with his own razor glove. Then Lori wanted to get revenge on Freddy when she discovered he had killed her mother, she decapitated Freddy's head-off. At the end Jason fell into the lake until he rose the next day with Freddy's head and later Freddy winked.

<doc id="295359" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295359" title="Milankovich cycle">
Milankovich cycle

Milankovich cycles are small, slow but regular changes in the Earth's orbit round the Sun, and the tilt of the Earth's axis. 
The dynamics are complex. The changes affect the 'insolation' (sunlight falling on parts of the Earth). This leads to cycles of climate on Earth, at about 21,000, 41,000 years, 100,000 and 400,000 years. This whole field is still under active research.
Using applied mathematics, Milanković predicted that variations in eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession of the Earth's orbit caused climate patterns on Earth.
Similar astronomical theories had been advanced in the 19th century by Joseph Adhemar, James Croll and others. However, there was at first no reliable dated evidence. The issue was not settled until deep-ocean cores were taken and a paper published in "Science" in 1976. 
Earth's orbit is an ellipse. The eccentricity is a measure of the departure of this ellipse from circularity. The shape of the Earth's orbit varies in time between nearly circular and mildly elliptical. 
The angle of the Earth's axial tilt varies with respect to the plane of the Earth's orbit. 
When the obliquity increases, the summers in both hemispheres receive more heat and light from the Sun, and winters less. Conversely, when the obliquity decreases, summers receive less sunshine and winters more. These slow 2.4° obliquity variations are roughly periodic. They take about 41,000 years to shift between a tilt of 22.1° and 24.5° and back again.
Precession is the wobble of the Earth's axis. This gyroscopic motion is due to the tidal forces exerted by the sun and the moon on the solid Earth, which has the shape of an oblate spheroid rather than a sphere. The sun and moon contribute roughly equally to this effect. Its period is about 26,000 years.
When the axis points toward the Sun, one polar hemisphere has a greater difference between the seasons while the other has milder seasons. The hemisphere that is in summer at perihelion receives much of the corresponding increase in solar radiation, but that same hemisphere in winter at aphelion has a colder winter. The other hemisphere will have a relatively warmer winter and cooler summer.
Planets orbiting the Sun follow elliptical (oval) orbits that rotate gradually over time (apsidal precession). 
In addition, the orbital ellipse itself precesses in space, primarily as a result of interactions with Jupiter and Saturn. This shortens the period of the precession of the equinoxes from 25,771.5 to ~21,636 years.
The inclination of Earth's orbit drifts up and down relative to its present orbit with a cycle having a period of about 70,000 years. Milankovitch did not study this three-dimensional movement. This movement is known as 'precession of the ecliptic' or 'planetary precession'.
Researchers noted this drift, and also that the orbit moves relative to the orbits of the other planets. The invariable plane, the plane that represents the angular momentum of the Solar System, is approximately the orbital plane of Jupiter. The inclination of the Earth's orbit has a 100,000 year cycle relative to the invariable plane. This is very similar to the 100,000 year eccentricity period. This 100,000-year cycle closely matches the 100,000-year pattern of ice ages.
It has been proposed that a disk of dust and other debris exists in the plane, which affects the Earth's climate. The Earth moves through this plane around January 9 and July 9, when there is an increase in radar-detected meteors and meteor-related noctilucent clouds.
A study of the Antarctic ice core, using oxygen-nitrogen ratios in air bubbles trapped in the ice, concluded that the climatic response documented in the ice cores was driven by Northern hemisphere insolation as proposed by the Milankovitch hypothesis. This is an additional validation of the Milankovitch hypothesis by a relatively new method. It is not consistent with the "inclination" theory of the 100,000-year cycle.

Rainband

A rainband is an area of rainfall where all the clouds and precipitation are stretched out in a long line or band. Rainbands can be stratiform or convective. They are caused by differences in temperature. When seen on a weather radar, the long narrow shape is called a banded structure. Rainbands in a tropical cyclone are curved and may even spiral around the center of the cyclone. Tropical cyclone rainbands include rain showers and thunderstorms. When this includes an eyewall and the eye, they make a hurricane or tropical storm. The size of rainbands around a tropical cyclone helps to measure the cyclone's intensity.
Rainbands that form near and ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which can produce tornadoes. The shape of rainbands linked with cold fronts can be changed by mountains. The mountains block the winds which can then form a low-level barrier jet. Bands of thunderstorms can form when sea breeze and land breezes meet, if enough moisture is present. Sometimes sea breeze rainbands which are ahead of a cold front, can hide the location of the cold front itself. Rainbands in an extratropical cyclone can cause large amounts of rain or snow. Behind extratropical cyclones, rainbands can form downwind of large, warmer bodies of water such as the Great Lakes. If the air is cold enough, these rainbands can cause heavy snowfalls.
Rainbands ahead of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts have little upward motion. They tend to be wide and stratiform in nature. In an atmosphere with rich low level moisture and vertical wind shear, narrow, convective rainbands form. These are known as squall lines, and are usually in the cyclone's warm sector, ahead of strong cold fronts associated with extratropical cyclones. Wider rain bands can form behind cold fronts, which usually have more stratiform, and less convective, precipitation. In colder cyclones, small bands of heavy snow can occur with a width of to . These bands are linked with areas of frontogensis, or zones of strengthening temperature contrast. The curved air flow from extratropical cyclones bringing cold air across the relatively warm Great Lakes can lead to narrow lake effect snow bands. These can bring heavy localized snowfalls.
Rainbands exist on the edges of tropical cyclones, and point towards the cyclone's center of low pressure. Rainbands within tropical cyclones need moisture and a low level pool of cooler air. Bands located to from a cyclone's center move outward. They can cause heavy rains and squalls of wind, as well as tornadoes. Some rainbands move closer to the center, forming a secondary, or outer, eyewall within intense hurricanes. Spiral rainbands are such a basic part of a tropical cyclone that in most tropical cyclone basins, use of the satellite-based Dvorak technique is the main method used to determine a tropical cyclone's maximum sustained winds. Using this method, the area of spiral banding and difference in temperature between the eye and eyewall is used to estimate the maximum sustained wind and a central pressure. 
Convective rainbands can form parallel mountains on their windward side. This is due to lee waves triggered by hills just upstream of the cloud's formation. Their spacing is normally to apart. When rainbands near frontal zones get close to steep mountains, a low-level barrier jet stream forms parallel to and just before the mountain ridge. This slows down the frontal rainband just before the mountain barrier. If enough moisture is present, sea breeze and land breeze fronts can form convective rainbands. Sea breeze front thunderstorm lines can become strong enough to hide the location of an approaching cold front by evening. The edge of ocean currents can cause thunderstorm bands due to heat differences where they meet. Downwind of islands, rainbands can form when low level winds meet downwind of the island edges. Offshore California, this has been noted in the wake of cold fronts.

The ÖFB-Frauenliga (German for ÖFB Women's League) is the highest level of Women soccer in Austria. The most successful team was USC Landhaus Wien with 12 titels, in the last years SV Neulengbach was the best club in Austria winning all titels from 2003/04 on.
Women football was played in Austria actually before the Second World War. In 1936 the first championship was organized by the "Österreichische Damenfußball-Union" (Austrian Ladies Soccer Union) with 9 teams from the Vienna area. But after the occupation of Austria by Nazi Germany it was suppressed. This continued till the end of the 1960s. In 1968 USC Landhaus Wien was one of the first women soccer clubs in Autria. In 1972 the first women championship after the war was organized by the Vienna Football Union. 1980 the first pure women soccer club (Union Kleinmünchen from Upper Austria) was founded. In 1982 the ÖFB organized the championship for the first time. Actually 334 teams are playing in 5 divisions. Also the number of players increased from 7 000 (2008) to around 17 000.
Since 2002 the Austrian Champion plays in the UEFA Women’s Cup.

Middle Jurassic

The Middle Jurassic is the second geological epoch in the Jurassic. It began 174.1 million years ago, and ended at 163.5 million years ago.
In the Middle Jurassic, Pangaea began to split apart. It began to separate into Laurasia and Gondwana, and the Atlantic Ocean formed. Tectonic activities closed the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. A subduction zone on the coast of western North America continues to create the ancestral Rocky Mountains.
During this time, marine life (including ammonites and bivalves) flourished. Ichthyosaurs, although common, are reduced in diversity. A type of crocodilians first appeared.
Plesiosaurs became common at this time. The top marine predators, the pliosaurs, grew to the size of killer whales and larger e.g. "Pliosaurus", "Liopleurodon".
New types of dinosaurs evolved on land. "Cetiosaurus" was an early sauropod found in England in the mid-19th century.
The environment in which "Cetiosaurus" lived was floodplain and open woodland. Brachiosaurs, "Megalosaurus" and "Hypsilophodon" also lived in this environment.
The cynodont therapsids flourished with the dinosaurs, but they were only shrew-sized. None grew larger than a badger. One group of cynodonts, the Trithelodonts were becoming rare and eventually became extinct at the end of this epoch. The Tritylodonts were still common, though. In this epoch "true" mammals evolved from a group of cynodonts.
Conifers were dominant in the Middle Jurassic. Other plants, such as ginkgoes, cycads, and ferns were also common. These are the trees which the large herbivores ate.

Club des Hashischins

The Club des Hashischins, the Hashish Club, (sometimes also spelled Club des Hashishins or Club des Hachichins), was a Parisian group who explored using drugs, mainly hashish, to get creative ideas. 
It was active from about 1844 to 1849. Some of the most important literary and intellectual people in Paris were members. They including Dr. Jacques-Joseph Moreau, Théophile Gautier, Charles Baudelaire, Victor Hugo, Honoré de Balzac Gérard de Nerval, Eugène Delacroix and Alexandre Dumas, père. Monthly "séances" were held at the Hôtel de Lauzun (at that time: Hôtel Pimodan) on the Île Saint-Louis.
Gautier wrote about the club in an article called the "Le Club des Hachichin" published in the "Revue des Deux Mondes" in February 1846. While he is often said to have started the club, in the article he says he was attending their séances for the first time that evening.
The group dressed up in Arab clothing. They drank coffee and added hashish, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, pistachio, sugar, orange juice, butter and cantharides. It was a thick, green mixture, like a jam.
Dr. Moreau wrote a book in 1846 about the cannabis and the drug taking experiments of the club. The 439 page book was called "Hashish and Mental Illness - Psychological Studies". Baudelaire wrote that while the drug did give people ideas, it quickly affected their personality. They felt they could only create while under the influence of the drug.

Fantaisie-Impromptu

Frédéric Chopin's Fantaisie-Impromptu in C-sharp minor is a solo piano composition. It is one of his best-known pieces. It was composed in 1834 and was published by Julian Fontana after though even though Chopin asked him not to do so.
The structure of the piece is in "A B A Coda" form. Some aspects of this piece are similar to Beethoven's "Moonlight" Sonata. The opening tempo is "allegro agitato". It changes to "largo" for the two bars after the 'A' section. The tempo for most of the 'B' section is "moderato cantabile". Finally, after the 'B' section, it changes to presto. The piece on a C-sharp major rolled chord.

Ustaše

The Ustaše (also called Ustashas or Ustashi) was a Croatian racist, terrorist, and Nazi-like movement. It was engaged in terrorist activities before World War II. Under the protection of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, the Ustaše ruled a part of Yugoslavia, after Yugoslavia was occupied by Italy and Germany. At the end of World War II, the Ustaše were defeated and expelled by the Yugoslav Partisans.
Croatian politician Stjepan Radić was shot on October 1928 and died a month later. Alexander I, King of Yugoslavia, imposed a royal dictatorship in January 1929 and made all political parties illegal. Ante Pavelić left the country for Vienna. He and Gustav Perčec, a former Austro-Hungarian Lieutenant colonel, established contact with organization of Macedonian political emigres. These two groups agreed to coordinate their political activities for achieving full independence for Macedonia and Croatia. There and then, Pavelić secretly met with the leader of outlawed Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), Ivan Mikhailov, a declared enemy of Yugoslavia, and made agreement with him to cooperate against the Yugoslav state.
Due to these circumstances, the Court for the Preservation of the State in Belgrade sentenced Pavelić and Perčec to death on 17 July 1929. The exiles started organizing support for their cause among the Croatian emigration in Europe, North America, and South America. The Ustaše organization was small in numbers and was organized in military patterns. They fought Yugoslav statehood by means of terror.
The roots of the Ustaše ideology were in the Croatian nationalism of the nineteenth century. The Ustaše ideological system was chiefly based on the traditional pure Croatian nationalism of Ante Starčević. About it, W. Safran wroteBut another vision of Croatian identity that was closely tied to the Catholic Church and the Vatican and was led by an ex-seminarist Ante Starcevic became the ideological precursor to the Ustase. Starcevic and his followers emphasized the high achievements of Western Catholic, Croatian culture, while Serbian culture was depicted as oriental and inferior. Starčević's racism was further fully elaborated by Ustaša Ivo Pilar [under the pseudonym L. von Südland]. His book was translated into Croatian in 1943, by Pavelić's regime, as one of the tenets of his Ustaše and his Independent State of Croatia. At the same time, the Ustaše borrowed from traditional Croatian nationalism, the National-Socialism of Hitler, the fascism of Mussolini, and even from the program of the Croatian Peasant Party. The Ustaše aimed at an ethnically "pure" Croatia, and saw the Serbs that lived in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina as their biggest obstacle. Along that line, Ustaše ministers Mile Budak, Mirko Puk, and Milovan Žanić declared in May 1941 that the goal of the new Ustaše policy was an ethnically clean Croatia. They also publicly announced the strategy (on July 22, 1941 ) to achieve their goal, which resembled the bloodiest religious wars: "A third must become Catholic, a third must leave the country, and a third must die!"
The Ustaše persecuted the Serbs, who were Orthodox Christians. 
The Ustaše's problem with the Nazi ideology was that the Croats are Slavs and were considered inferior by Nazi standards. Ustaše ideology thus created a theory about a pseudo-Gothic origin of the Croats in order to raise their standing on the Aryan ladder.
At Janka Puszta training facility in Hungary, IMRO terrorists trained Ustaše operatives in bomb-making and in conspirational activities. The Ustaše put that knowledge to immediate use, carrying out about half-dozen assassinations of Yugoslavian officials or pro-Serb civilians. They carried out a dozen bombings of trains, including the Orient Express, and other public targets during the first four years of their existence. This caused the Yugoslav Government to complain to the League of Nations and forced Hungary to close down Janka Pusta Ustaše training camp. Internal power struggle, and discovery that Perčec's mistress was a Yugoslav police informant, will lead to the Perčec assassination by Pavelić in 1933.
The Ustaše received the most funds from Mussolini, who also supplied this group with an Italian headquarters that changed location whenever Yugoslavia managed to track it down. Camps for training terrorists and saboteurs were set up in Italy, chiefly at Brescia and Borgotaro. An armed insurrection was attempted in 1933, when the Ustaše, armed by the Italians, attempted to invade Yugoslavia by crossing the Adriatic Sea in motorboats. This was unsuccessful, but its lack of success probably was instrumental in the decision to assassinate King Alexander I of Yugoslavia.
Two attempts were made; the last one was successful. Alexander was murdered at Marseilles on 9 October 1934, along with the French Foreign Minister, Louis Barthou. In the wake of the assassination, Mussolini renounced the Ustaše, and the group went deeply underground. The singular lack of armed protection afforded to the Yugoslav king, and the general laxity of security precautions when it was well-known that one attempt had already been made on Alexander's life, are grim tributes to Pavelić organizational abilities. He had apparently been able to bribe a high official in the Surete General. The Prefect of Police of Marseilles, Jouhannaud, was subsequently removed from office.
The assassin was Vlada Georgief Cernozemski, a Bulgarian, who had already killed two members of the Bulgarian Parliament in Sofia. His accomplices were arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment. Pavelic was condemned to death by France, but managed to escape.
Yugoslavia brought charges against Hungary and Italy before the League of Nations in November 1934, offering evidence that Italy and Hungary had openly conspired against her sovereignty. The League of Nations did not discuss the Italian conspiracy against the national sovereignty of Yugoslavia. Moreover, Italy refused to extradite Pavelić and Kvaternik to either France or Yugoslavia, and Hungary bore the brunt of the charges.
After the assassination, the Ustaše activities were prevented completely. A great number of Ustaše were caught and arrested in Italy, Germany, and Hungary. Italy interned many Ustashe to the Lipari camp, where many died. Janka Puszta Ustaše camp was raided by Hungarian police, who arrested some of them. Ustaše from Germany escaped to Switzerland, France, and England.
Widespread outrage at the assassination of Alexander and Barthou led to the first international efforts to combat terrorism since the St. Petersburg Protocol of 1904. The issue was taken up by the League of Nations, which passed the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism in 1937.
After March 1937, when Italy and Yugoslavia signed a friendship treaty, many Ustaše in Italy were extradited to Yugoslavia.
Germany and Italy invaded Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941. On April 10, the most senior home-based Ustaša, Slavko Kvaternik, took control of the police in Zagreb and in a radio broadcast that day proclaimed the formation of the Independent State of Croatia ("Nezavisna Država Hrvatska", NDH). Maček issued a statement that day, calling on all Croatians to cooperate with the new authorities.
Meanwhile, Pavelić and several hundred Ustaše left their camps in Italy for Zagreb, where Pavelić set up his government on 17 April. He accorded himself the title of "Poglavnik", - which was equivalent to "Führer," or "Headman" in English. Pavelić's "Independent State of Croatia" comprised territory of Croatia, Srem, and Bosnia-Herzegovina - except parts of the Dalmatian coast and islands, which were ceded to the Italians. "De facto" control over this territory varied for the majority of the war, as the Partisans grew more successful, while the Germans and Italians increasingly exercised direct control over areas of their interest.
All who opposed and/or threatened the Ustaše were outlawed. In early 1941, Jews and Serbs were ordered to leave certain areas of Zagreb.
Pavelić first met with Adolf Hitler on 6 June 1941. Mile Budak, then a minister in Pavelić's government, publicly proclaimed the violent racial policy of the state on 22 July 1941. Maks Luburić, one of the chiefs of the secret police, started building concentration camps in the summer of the same year. Ustaše activities in villages across the Dinaric Alps led to the Italians and the Germans expressing disquiet. As early as July 10, 1941, Wehrmacht General Edmund Glaise von Horstenau reported the following to the German High Command, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW):
A Gestapo report to Reichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler, dated February 17, 1942, stated that:
Italian troops in the field had competing territorial claims with their Ustaše allies and had cooperated from the start with Chetnik units operating in the southern areas that they controlled. Hitler tried to insist that Mussolini should have his forces work with the Ustaše, but senior Italian commanders, such as General Mario Roatta, ignored such orders.
The Ustaše enacted race laws patterned after those of Nazi Germany. These laws were aimed against Jews, Roma, and Serbs, who were collectively declared enemies of the Croatian people. Serbs, Jews, Roma and anti-fascist Croats and Bosniaks, including communists, were interned in concentration camps, the largest of which was the Jasenovac complex, where many were killed by Ustaše militia. The exact number of victims is not known. The number of murdered Jews is fairly reliable: around 32,000 Jews were killed during World War II on NDH territory. Gypsies (Yugoslav Roma) numbered around 40,000 fewer after the war. Of the number of Serbs who died, estimates tend to vary between 300,000 and 700,000.
The history textbooks in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia cited 700,000 as the total number of victims at Jasenovac. According to the Simon Wiesenthal Center (citing the "Encyclopedia of the Holocaust"), "Ustasa terrorists killed 500,000 Serbs, expelled 250,000 and forced 250,000 to convert to Catholicism. They murdered thousands of Jews and Gypsies."
The Jasenovac Memorial Area, currently headed by Slavko Goldstein, keeps a list of 59,188 names of Jasenovac victims that was gathered by government officials in Belgrade in 1964. The previous head of the Memorial Area, Simo Brdar, estimated at least 365,000 dead at Jasenovac.
The Belgrade Museum of the Holocaust compiled a list of over 77,000 names of Jasenovac victims. It was previously headed by Milan Bulajić, who supported the claim of a total of 700,000 victims. The current administration of the Museum has further expanded the list to include a bit over 80,000 names. During the 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann, Alexander Arnon (secretary of the Jewish Community in Zagreb) testified about the treatment of Jews in Yugoslavia during the war.
Alexander Arnon's testimony included estimates of six hundred of thousand killed in the Jasenovac concentration camp.
During World War II, various German military commanders gave different figures for the number of Serbs, Jews and others killed on the territory of the Independent State of Croatia. They circulated figures of 400,000 Serbs (Alexander Lehr); 350,000 Serbs (Lothar Rendulic); between 300,000 (Edmund Glaise von Horstenau); more than "3/4 of a million Serbs" (Hermann Neubacher) in 1943; 600-700,000 until March 1944 (Ernst Fick); 700,000 (Massenbach).
The first group of camps was formed in the spring of 1941. These included:
These six camps were closed by October 1942. The Jasenovac complex was built between August 1941 and February 1942. The first two camps, Krapje and Bročica, were closed in November 1941. The three newer camps continued to function until the end of the war:
There were also other camps in:
Numbers of prisoners:
The Ustaše held the position that Eastern Orthodoxy, as a symbol of Serbian nationalism to them, was their greatest enemy. The Ustaše never recognized the existence of a Serb people on the territories of Croatia or Bosnia. They recognized only "Croats of the Eastern faith." They also called Bosnian Muslims "Croats of the Islamic faith,"(the latter which they wanted to force to convert to Christianity) but they had a stronger ethnic dislike of Serbs.
Some former priests, mostly Franciscans, took part in the atrocities themselves. Miroslav Filipović was a Franciscan friar (from the Petrićevac monastery), who joined the Ustaša army on 7 February 1942 in a brutal massacre of 2730 Serbs of the nearby villages, including 500 children. Filipović became Chief Guard of Jasenovac concentration camp, where he was nicknamed "Fra Sotona" by the camp inmates. He was hanged for his war crimes in his Franciscan robes.
For the duration of the war, the Vatican kept up full diplomatic relations with the Ustaša state (granting Pavelić an audience), with its papal nuncio in the capital Zagreb. The nuncio was briefed on the efforts of religious conversions to Roman Catholicism. After the Second World War was over, the Ustaše who had managed to escape from Yugoslav territory (including Pavelić) were smuggled to South America. It is widely documented that this was done through rat lines operated by members of the organization who were Catholic priests and had previously secured positions at the Vatican. Members of the Illyrian College of San Girolamo in Rome were reputedly involved in this: friars Krunoslav Draganović, Petranović, and Dominik Mandić.
The Ustaše regime had sent large amounts of gold that it had plundered from Serbian and Jewish property owners during WWII into Swiss banks. Of a total of 350 million Swiss Francs, about 150 million was seized by British troops; however, the remaining 200 million (ca. 47 million dollars) reached the Vatican. Allegations exist that it is still being kept in the Vatican Bank. This was reported by the American intelligence agency SSU in October 1946. This issue is the theme of a recent class action lawsuit against the Vatican Bank and others.
Adolf Eichmann trial witness Alexander Arnon testified about the Roman Catholic Church stance that time: 
Unfortunately there were no protests. Croatia was definitely a Catholic state. Not even the Catholic Church in Zagreb said one word against the deportations and sufferings of the Jews.
E. Fratini and D. Cluster wrote in their book "The entity: Five centuries of secret Vatican espionage:"
The Archbishop of Zagreb, Monisgor Alojzije Stepinac, provided Catholic support to the Pro Nazi government of Ante Pavelic; knew right from the start about the massacres and extermination of Serbs, Jews, and Gypsies; and was one of the pillars of the effort to help Nazi and Croatian criminals to escape to South America after the Second World War.
Archbishop Stepinac also said this on 28 March 1941, in note of Yugoslavia's early attempts to unite Croatians and Serbs: "All in all, Croats and Serbs are of two worlds, northpole and southpole, never will they be able to get together unless by a miracle of God. The schism (Eastern Orthodoxy) is the greatest curse in Europe, almost greater than Protestantism. Here there is no moral, no principles, no truth, no justice, no honesty."
At the end of war, Ustaše continued fighting for a short while after the formal surrender of German Army Group E on 9 May 1945, and many refugees attempted to escape to Austria. Pavelić, however, with the help of associates among the Franciscans, managed to escape and hide in Austria and Rome, later fleeing to Argentina.
The remaining Ustaše went underground or fled to South America and countries such as Canada, Australia, Germany, with the assistance of Roman Catholic churches and their grassroots supporters Some of them persisted in their crusade against Yugoslavia.
With the defeat of the Independent State of Croatia, the movement ceased to exist. Infighting over the failure to establish a Croatian state also fragmented the surviving Ustaše. Ante Pavelić formed the Croatian Liberation Movement, which drew several of the former state's leaders. Vjekoslav Vrančić founded a reformed Croatian Liberation Movement, and was its leader. 
Vjekoslav Luburić helped form an organization called the "Croatian National Resistance" ("Hrvatski narodni odpor"). This became the most violent of the Ustaše organizations which were born after the WWII. Luburić commanded the organization for twenty-five years from his refuge in Spain. His organization was heavily involved in racketeering, attempted murder, extortion, hijacking, terrorist bombings, and other violent crimes. After his death, his successors on the organization commanding post sought out criminal organization ties with La Cosa Nostra, the Provisional IRA, and the Croatian Mafia in San Pedro. Odpor was banned in Germany for terrorist activities and operated (in the USA and Canada) between legitimate emigre functions and a thuggish underworld. Its leaders tried to distance the organization from the acts of the so-called renegade elements that hijacked international flights and served prison sentences for extortion. Odpor embraced a radical nationalist ideology that differed only marginally from Ustaše ideology.
The Odpor's most spectacular terrorist action was hijacking TWA Flight 355 on September 10, 1976. This terrorist action was masterminded by Zvonko Bušić, then the leader of the American branch of Odor. He and four other Croatian terrorists carried out the hijacking. Bušić also planted a bomb at Grand Central Station in New York City. An attempt to dismantle the bomb ended in a blast which killed one police officer and injured three others. All of the terrorists surrendered, and Bušić was sentenced to life in prison. The other four terrorists were sentenced to various long-term imprisonments.
Blagoje Jovovic, a Serb, shot Ante Pavelić near Buenos Aires, Argentina, on April 9th, 1957. Pavelić was injured and later died.
Another Ustaše terrorist organization, the Croatian Revolutionary Cell, Bruno Busic Department, bombed the R. S. Schullz publishing house in Percha on Lake Starnberg, Germany, on August 19, 1981. The group, which claims to be based in Paris, used one kilogram of Swiss Mark 2 dynamite. They threatened to use two more kilograms the following week if the firm published Tito's memoirs.

Uniformitarianism

Uniformitarianism is the idea that the same physical laws of today have always operated. It was the centerpiece of James Hutton's 1795 geology book "Theory of the Earth, with proofs and illustrations".
In this work Hutton proposed that the causes acting on the world today also acted in the past. This means that the rocks of the Earth were formed by processes which we can see operating today. These processes, though very slow (gradualism), made the world what it is today. The idea is part of a wider philosophy called the philosophy of naturalism.
The term 'uniformitarianism' was invented by William Whewell in 1837 to describe Hutton's basic idea. This idea is the foundation of modern geology. 
Hutton's ideas were popularised by John Playfair in 1802 in "Illustrations of the Huttonian theory of the Earth", and by Charles Lyell in his "Principles of geology" (1830 to 1833). The phrase "the present is the key to the past" is Lyell's most famous quotation.
Uniformitarianism in geology is opposed by catastrophism, the idea that major changes in the Earth take place through sudden and violent events.

Open Season 2

Open Season 2 is a 2008 animated-comedy direct-to-video movie and is the second movie in the "Open Season" movie series, directed by Matthew O'Challaghan and Todd Wilderman and produced by Kirk Bodyfelt and Matthew O'Challaghan. The movie was released on September 24, 2008 and received mixed reviews from reviewers, just like the first movie.
In the movie, Boog volunteers as the best man at Elliot (Joel McHale) and Giselle's (Jane Krakowski) wedding. However, the wilds are forced to go on an adventure when Mr. Weenie (Cody Cameron) gets captured by Bob and Bobbie (Georgia Engel) and being forced to become a domestic pet by the pets' leader Fifi (Crispin Glover).
Elliot is in love with Giselle and is thinking of getting married. But in an accident, Elliot's giant new antlers are cracked. Boog and the others cheer Elliot up by having a rabbit fight. Mr. Weenie finds a dog biscuit trail that his previous owners left behind and follows it. Elliot sees Mr. Weenie being taking away by his old owners, Bob and Bobbie. The wilds decide to make a rescue attempt to save him. Boog, Giselle, McSquizzy, Buddy, Serge, and Deni all join in.
Meanwhile, the tame pets meet. There is Fifi, a toy poodle and his basset hound companion Roberto, two cats; one named Stanley, whose companion is a mentally retarded cat named Roger, and a Southern dog named Rufus, whose companion is his girlfriend Charlene. The wilds find Weenie, much to Elliot's dismay, who does not want to marry Giselle. They free him from his chains, but accidentally leave him stuck on an RV along with Buddy. 
The owners, driving the RV, reach the pet camp with Mr. Weenie and Buddy. Buddy helps Weenie escape and Buddy tries to free Weenie from his shock collar. Meanwhile, Serge and Deni return and explain they found Weenie and Buddy at a pet camp, which they escaped from. Boog and the others set camp at a human camp. The wilds reach the pet camp, but the pets and their owners have already left, but realizes that they have gone to Pet Paradiso, a vacation spot for pets. Elliot finds Weenie and Buddy and goes to Pet Paradiso to save his friends.
The wilds reach Pet Paradiso and try to sneak in by disguising themselves as pets, with Giselle as a dalmatian and McSquizzy as a chihuahua. Boog attempts to sneak in as a cat, but gets the idea to be a sheepdog. Elliot also disguises himself as Boog's female human owner. Giselle and McSquizzy walk around Pet Paradiso looking for Mr. Weenie, but their cover is blown and are kidnapped by Fifi and the other pets. 
There is a battle between the wilds and the pets, with the Pet Paradiso security focused on tranquilizing the wilds. Elliot saves Giselle and accidentally places a pile of shock collars on himself. Fifi eventually grabs the remote and activates all the shock collars, but does not realize that Elliot put all the shock collars on him. Fifi survives, but the explosion caused him to lose his hair and become bald. The pets and the wilds settle their differences and decide to become friends. Elliot finally professes his true feelings for Giselle, and they get married. During a music number in the movie ending, Elliot falls off the edge again and his other antler falls off (again).
Sony announced the sequel in September 2007. And despite the first film grossing $85 million and $105 million outside the United States, Sony felt better with "Open Season 2" being performed on DVD, thus making a direct-to-DVD sequel. Sony Pictures Digital president said that "the studio will keep "Open Season 2" 's costs low by utilizing Imageworks' satellite facilities in India and New Mexico".
"Open Season 2" got mixed to average reviews from critics. Critic at DVD Verdict claimed, ""Open Season 2" is no classic (neither was the original), but it's a competent check-your-brain-at-the-door comedy for children of all ages. The animation and storytelling may not stack up against Pixar's (whose does?), but the flick offers something that Pixar movies generally don't: old cartoon slapstick and sight gags in the mold of Bugs Bunny."
On January 27, 2009, "Open Season 2" was released on DVD and Blu-ray.
The film received a direct-to-video sequel ("Open Season 3") on October 21, 2010.

Arctic ecology

Arctic ecology is the science that studies the ecology of the arctic. The arctic is all land and water north of the Arctic Circle (66 33’). This area is very cold and has little rain. In the winter there is almost no sunlight. The growing season, when farmers can grow crops, is very short.
The arctic biomes are taiga, boreal forest, and tundra. Many of the ecosystems in the arctic are fragile, and can be easily destroyed. These ecosystems are being hurt by global warming.
The arctic environment includes both land and water. Two important parts of this environment are sea ice and permafrost.
Sea ice is ice that floats in the ocean. It is made of frozen seawater. It is important because animals live and sleep on the ice, especially in winter. Sea ice lasts all year and never melts completely. There is less ice during the summer than during the winter.
Lots of land in the arctic is frozen all year long. Permafrost is a substrate (layer of soil) that has been frozen for two or more years. The dirt on top of the permafrost is called the "active layer". This dirt melts during the summer and is important for plants to grow.
In the arctic region there is less food. The algae is eaten by small insects. These insects are eaten by plankton. These are eaten by small fish these are eaten by big fish. Now, these are eaten by seals. Seals are at last eaten by polar bears.

A mechanism is a mechanical device for doing something. It includes the idea of tools and machines, but is used for a wider range of objects, processes and ideas. 
Palaeolithic hand axes were one of the first tools used by mankind. Simple modern mechanisms would be rope pulleys or levers. The internal combustion engine is a machine for turning oil into motion. A complicated example would be computers and the web.
The term is used by extension as a metaphor. Thus the celestial mechanics of Kepler and Newton is a way of predicting and explaining planetary motions in the Solar System. Darwin's natural selection is his proposed mechanism as to how evolution took place.
In this sense, a mechanism in science or technology is an explanation of how something works or might work.

<doc id="295555" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295555" title="Caps lock">
Caps lock

Caps lock is the name of a key on a computer keyboard. When you press this key, letters that you type will be capital letters (like this, "ABC"), instead of lowercase ("abc"). The caps lock key is usually above the Shift key and below the Tab key on the left side of the keyboard. However, some people prefer it to be in other locations.
The way the caps lock key works is that once you press it, a light may come on, or you may get a message on the screen. This lets you know that text that you type will be in uppercase letters. When you press the key again, the light turns off, or another message may appear, saying that caps lock has been turned off and text you type will be back to lowercase letters.
Some keyboards and typewriters have a key called shift lock. It is a lot like the caps lock key in that letters you type will be in uppercase instead of lowercase. But shift lock also does something else: when it is on, keys which have two symbols on them, such as the number keys in the top row, will print the symbol on top, instead of the symbol on the bottom. For example, pressing the key with the number 1 on it will print the exclamation mark ("!") instead of the number 1. The caps lock key does not do this; it only affects the letter keys.
People who type a lot, such as those who use typewriters, use the shift key instead of the caps lock or shift lock keys unless they have to type many capital letters in a row. But there is also a neat trick you can do with the caps lock and shift keys: when caps lock is on, you can hold the shift key while typing and what you type will be in lowercase letters instead of capitals. This can be done on some computers, such as those running Microsoft Windows computers. 
Not all computers have a caps lock key. Some of those that don't have been made for the One Laptop Per Child program.

For example, when the scroll lock mode was turned on, the arrow keys would scroll the contents of a text window instead of moving the cursor. Today, the key doesn't do anything in most programs, and as a result, many keyboards today, especially those on laptops, do not have the scroll lock key.

Organ donation means that an organ is transferred from the body of one person to that of another person. This is done by a process called transplantation. The quality of life of the person who receives the organ is improved to various degrees.
The donor is the person providing the organ to the recipient, who receives the organ through a surgery called transplantation.
Organs that can be transplanted are the heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, pancreas, intestine, skin, and thymus.
Tissues include bones, tendons, corneas, heart valves, and veins. 
Worldwide, the kidneys are the most commonly transplanted organs, followed closely by the liver and then the heart. 
The cornea, bones, and muscles are the most commonly transplanted tissues.
It is important for people to be aware that donating an organ or tissue changes the life of a fellow human being.
The field of medicine called Regenerative medicine has made scientific advances to grow or create organs or tissues from stem cells.
Still there is great demand for organs.

Assassination of John F. Kennedy

John F. Kennedy was the 35th President of the United States. He was assassinated (murdered) in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas, on Friday, November 22, 1963. This happened while he was traveling in a Presidential motorcade with his wife Jacqueline, the Governor of Texas John Connally, and the governor's wife Nellie.
As the car drove into Dealey Plaza, shots were fired. Kennedy was shot once in the throat, and once in the head. It happened at 12:30 p.m. Central Standard Time (18:30 UTC). The motorcade drove to Parkland Memorial Hospital away. At 1:00 p.m., Kennedy was pronounced dead.
Lee Harvey Oswald was the main suspect in the murder. He was arrested on the same day for the murder of a policeman, J. D. Tippit. He was charged with both murders later that night. Oswald denied shooting anyone. Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby two days later, on November 24. This was when Oswald was being moved from the police station to a jail. He died in Parkland Hospital.
The assassination left a lasting impression on many worldwide. As with Pearl Harbor before it and 9/11 after it, asking "Where were you when you heard about President Kennedy's assassination" would become a common topic of discussion.
An investigation into what happened was done by the Warren Commission in 1963–1964. It took 10 months. The commission decided that Oswald was the only person involved, and he had fired three shots from the window of a warehouse on the corner of Dealey Plaza. No one else was involved. The man who murdered Oswald, Jack Ruby, was also said to have acted alone.
Most people at the time believed this was true. However, other alternative theories as to what could have happened have developed. Surveys from 1966 to 2004 found that as many as 80 percent of Americans have suspected that there was a plot or cover-up.
Another investigation was done by the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in 1979. They found that President John F. Kennedy was probably killed as a result of a conspiracy (a secret plot). The HSCA found both the original FBI investigation and the Warren Commission Report to have big mistakes. They agree with the Commission that Oswald fired all the shots. But they say that there were at least four shots fired. They also say that it was very likely that two gunmen fired at the President. No gunmen or groups involved in the conspiracy were pointed out by the committee. They said that the CIA, the Soviet Union, organized crime and several other groups were not involved.
The assassination is still the subject of a lot of debate. There are a lot of conspiracy theories. Some researchers have suggested that Oswald was not the shooter. Others have suggested that he conspired with others to kill the president. Most of these theories accuse criminal groups, the military–industrial complex, the government of Cuba, the KGB, or the CIA. Lyndon Johnson, George H. W. Bush and Sam Giancana are among those accused. That mob boss Sam Giancana was responsible is supported by the account of his brother and nephew. Only one person was ever put on trial: Clay Shaw, but he was found not guilty.
Some have also argued that the gunshots were fired so quickly there must have been more than one assassin shooting at the President. This could be supported by the fact that most witnesses said that the second and third shots were fired closer together.
Some believe that the bullets could not have hit Kennedy in the place they hit him if they had really been fired from the warehouse. Many of the workers at Parkland Hospital reported that a large portion of the back of the President's head appeared to have been blown out. This may suggest that he had been hit from the front.

Motorcade

A motorcade (or convoy, carcade, autocade) is a number of vehicles driving in the same direction on official business. 
Motorcades can be used to transport a very important person (VIP), usually a political figure. Such a motorcade is usually accompanied by police cars and other protection. This is to make sure the people in the motorcade are safe. For instance, motorcades for presidents often have four to six armoured cars, with police motorcycles and cars going in front and behind.
Depending on the size of the motorcade and who it is carrying, streets may be completely blocked off so no-one else can use them. This is common for the security of heads of state or government.
Motorcades can be used as protests and demonstrations. A large, organised, group of vehicles will travel a busy route at very slow speed. They do this to deliberately cause traffic disruption. This is often in relation to protest groups that have access to many large vehicles, such as truckers and farmers. 
A "funeral cortege" is a group of mourners following a hearse in a motorcade of cars.

For example, if the warm front is already there and the cold front comes along, the cold front is heavier than the warm front so will push it up. The warm front slides over the cold one. When the cold front catches up to the a warm front, the warm air is pushed up into the air. This is an occluded front. Cloud and rain form along the occluded front until temperatures become equal as the cold and warm air mix.

He was the bridge-builder between East and the West due to his great knowledge. He had the ability to simplify complex ideas.
Dr. Radhakrishnan was critical of the way teaching of Western Philosophers. The basis of criticism was that theology dominated the western thinkers preventing freedom of expression . He wrote books on Indian philosophy according to Western academic standards, and made all efforts for the West to give serious consideration to Indian philosophy. In his book, Idealist View of Life, he compares different ways of thought process and favours the simplistic rational way. He is well known for his analysis of "Human Way of life" by listening from elders (Upanishads), use of common sense (Bramha Sutra) and practical way of living (Bhagvad Gita).He is the main reason for teachers day.

A speedrun is a play-through, or a recording of this play-through of a whole video game or a part of it. The player tries to complete this game as fast as possible. This is done for entertainment and competition. The term is a compound of the words "speed" and "run" (run means playing the game here). It is usually used for games which do not have quickly finishing them as one of the main goals. For example, gamers do not "speedrun" a racing game. In those cases the game's standard setting for recording fast times is called a "time attack" or "time trial" mode. Speedruns are usually recorded on video tapes (mainly where consoles are concerned), or as a digital file, by the people ("players") who make them. It is recorded for entertainment. It can also be used by others to verify that the players actually completed the game in the time they said that they did. Speedruns were created for entertainment. People who began comparing each others' playing skills through videos exchanged over the Internet started speedruns. People want verifiability to see whether a person followed the rules and thus see whether the run counts as a valid attempt to beat the record.
Speedrunning began as a small project. It was started few people who shared their runs online. However, it has become a phenomenon which is discussed in several active websites. There are many speedrun videos distributed for free on the Internet.
Tool Assisted speedruns [TAS] are played on a computer emulator. The player records the movie on the emulator and submits the movie file to TASvideos.org if the movie file is good enough to obsolete a published run on their site. These types of speedruns take longer to make because the player can use the advantage of going back in time in the game and finding the fastest reactions for enemies and other items to beat the game in a time which the game developer would never thought the game could be beaten so quickly. 
Normal speedruns are played on a console or PC and recorded with a capture card or a DVD recorder. PC games are recorded with high quality screen recording software such as FRAPS and OBS.The most common normal speedrun site is called Speed Demos Archive. They split the runs into categories: any% (which means that the runner do what it takes to complete the game), 100% (which means that the do the whole game.) and low% (which means that the player uses large frame glitches). Before the speedrun is uploaded onto Speed Demos Archive, they have to verify the run to make sure that the runner was not cheating or using any game hacks.
Many speedruns take advantage of bugs in video games, especially clipping problems that allow a player to walk through walls.

Behak Maken

Behak Maken is a village in the Sargodha District of the Punjab province of Pakistan. It is 17.5 km from Sargodha city and 10 km away from Dhreema, due to its geographical location, the British Royal Air Force built an air base between Chak No 92 NB and Chak No 105 NB (Godhay wala) nearby. It took on greater importance after the Independence of Pakistan for the Pakistan Air Force. The population grew rapidly. Approximately 75% of the population of this village belongs to the Maken caste or clan of this region.
Behak Maken was supposedly founded when one Raja Singh, Maken Rajput, first came to the Sargodha district (old Shahpur) sometime during the 12th or 13th century AD. It is claimed that the famous Punjabi Sufi saint Baba Farid "Ganj Shakar" appeared to Singh to instruct him in Islam after which the Raja settled permanently in the district with his family as a Muslim. He and his progeny founded this village and others in the vicinity.
Towards the end of the fifteenth century, some of the Baloch tribe from Makran migrated and flocked into the country in and around Mankera,and subsequently ruled here for the next three hundred years. Later on, it fell under Sikh rule until 1849, when the Punjab was annexed by the East India Company and thus British rule lasted here until 1947.
According to the 1998 census of Pakistan the village had a population of 5,513. In May 2011 the population of Behak Maken was estimated at 7000. About 90% of the people are followers of Sunni Islam.
The predominant ethnic population in the village is Punjabi with small communities of Muhajirs (immigrants/settlers from India) and Pashtuns.
The economy of this village is primarily agrarian. The vast fields of the village have allowed the farmers to develop a range of crops and animal breeding programs. Some of the main crops include citrus, wheat, rice, and sugar cane which are exported to the other cities as well as internationally. Citrus fruits such as oranges (local hybrid variety known as "kinnows") are the main fruit grown in the village. Other fruits grown here are Jaman, Guavas and Mangoes, Pears, Dates and Pomegranates. Almonds are also grown in minor quantities. Turnip, Onion, Cauliflower, Potatoes and Tomatoes are the main vegetables grown in the village. The main livestock in the village include goats, sheep, buffaloes and cattle. The village also supports an orange pulp processing factory on Jhang road.
Behak Maken has an elementary school for boys and one primary school for girls. Many students go to University/Colleges for their studies at Sargodha and Sahiwal, many children are studying in Chak No 84 NB (English medium school) and some also study in a number of small, private academies at Sargodha. Sargodha has several institutions of higher education and several research centres and the local Sargodha University.
During the British Raj most of the Maken clan or caste traditionally supported the Unionist Party (Punjab) but by the late 1940s, the swing started in favour of the All India Muslim League. After the creation of independent Pakistan, most of the people here remain supporters of the various Pakistan Muslim League factions, today.
An "Urs" (program of religious festivities) is held here every year on 25 March, in the memory of Syed Pir Hashim Darya Hamdani. Many followers come from different cities, towns and villages in Pakistan. It is a popular and joyous occasion with a "Qawwali" musical fest as well as a small rural fair with rides and other fun activities.
Punjabi is the main language of the people here. Urdu is also spoken widely.
Frequently two types of sports competition are played in this rural community. Volleyball and cricket are especially popular.
Many welfare groups are functioning in this community; they perform and organize any time any type of work for the help and development of this village like construction / repair of Mosques, Madrass, basic infrastructure, streets and roads and more.
Behak Maken residents and other populated places and communities in the vicinity are

Van Rensburg studied singing with Werner Neel at the Northwest University of South Africa, but also law and international politics at Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education.
He made his debut in 1991 at the age of 20 as Belmonte in Mozart's "Die Entführung aus dem Serail" for the Roodeport City Opera. In 1996, he started an engagement at the Gärtnerplatztheater in Munich. Since the year 2000 van Rensburg has been working regularly with the Lautten Compagney Berlin (director: Wolfgang Katschner). With this ensemble he staged Monteverdi's "L'Orfeo" and published three recordings. Since 2011 van Rensburg collaborates with a different emsemble for Ancient and New Music, called "così facciamo". With them he staged Handel’s "Ariodante".
He sung his first name part as and in Mozart’s Idomeneo in 2006 for the New York Metropolitan Opera. Van Rensburg‘s repertoire focuses on Baroque music.
However, he has also made his mark in song and Lied interpretation, focusing on English Baroque composers (i.e. Dowland, Byrd, Purcell), as well as German composers Beethoven, Schumann and Schubert, to name only a few.
At the Munich Gärtnerplatztheater van Rensburg staged, together with the librettist Peer Boysen the pasticcio "Ein Theater nach der Mode" in 2002, featuring compositions by Handel and other Baroque composers.

Just like in his former own production "Il Pianto d'Orfeo" van Rensburg links the expressiveness of dancing with the music of the composition. The dancer serves as an Alter ego to the singer and thereby illustrates the emotions of the character he or she impersonates.

Heinrich event

Heinrich events occurred during the coldest point of "Bond Cycles" in which many icebergs were discharged into the North Atlantic and melted.
Evidence for this can be found in the north Atlantic sediment cores which show poorly sorted, angular and contain rocks. These were originally in the icebergs but dropped to the bottom of the ocean when the icebergs melted.
Heinrich events are a possible trigger to the onset of mini ice ages which follow a long period of thaw. An example might be the Younger Dryas, a brief cold period from about 12.8 thousand years ago to about 11.5 thousand years ago. 
The Younger Dryas stadial is thought to have been caused by the collapse of the North American ice sheets, although rival theories have been proposed.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (short form: "Call of Duty: MW3") is a first-person shooter video game. It is the eighth game in the "Call of Duty" series and the third game in the "Modern Warfare" series. The game was made by Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games and Raven Software. The game was released on November 8, 2011.
The game is a first-person shooter, like the other "Call of Duty" games. There are three main sections to the gameplay: campaign, special ops (the cooperative mode) and multiplayer.
The campaign follows the events of "". Russia continues its invasion of the United States of America and expands its attack to Europe, including the coutries England, France and Germany. The characters include people from previous games in the "Modern Warfare" series such as: John "Soap" Mactavish, Captain Price, Makarov and Macmillan.
There are three parts to the special ops mode: the Mission, Survival and Chaos modes. The Mission mode is a game mode that comes back from the special ops mode of "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2". In the Mission mode, players do lots of different missions and get stars for their work. The Survival mode is a new game mode. In the Survival mode, waves after waves of enemies attack the player/s. There is no way to complete Survival mode because the waves keep coming. There are thirty seconds between each wave of enemies. This is so the player has time to buy weapons, explosives and Pointstreaks. The Chaos mode is another new mode. Players must earn the most money they can, which is done by keeping the multiplier going and killing as many enemies as possible as quickly as possible. Weapons are scattered around the map, and perks and care packages assist the players.
One or two players can do Survival, Chaos and most Missions. Some Missions need two players.
The multiplayer is similar to that of "Modern Warfare 2". Players can do the multiplayer mode online or locally.
Players can play different game modes in a variety of maps. As the player does more, they unlock new weapons, attachments and perks. They also unlock new titles and emblems, and they increase their multiplayer rank until the limit of 80. Players can enter "Prestige" mode once they complete level 80. This resets all the player's weapons, perks and pointstreaks. The first time it is done, the player will be on Prestige 1, and so on. This can be done 20 times. If a player has reached Prestige 20, they can spend a Prestige Token to reset all statistics to level 0, Prestige 0.
The Killstreak system is now called the Pointstreak system and it has changed very much. There are now three Pointstreak packages. A player picks one package and selects three rewards from it. In previous games, Killstreaks could only be earned by killing other players. Poinstreaks can now be earned for completing objectives in any objective mode, or by shooting down enemy air support. Pointstreak rewards are organized into three different Strike Packages called Assault, Support and Specialist. In "Modern Warfare 3", there are lots of new maps, weapons et cetera. However, the overall way the game is played is the same. DLC packs include maps from previous games, but they mostly need payment to unlock them. Players can play as an American, Briton, African, Russian or as a Frenchman, although this is randomly chosen. The multiplayer factions are Delta Force, Special Air Service, Spetsnaz, GIGN, Inner Circle, Africa Militia and PMC.
On May 12, 2011, four teaser trailers were released on the official "Call Of Duty" YouTube channel. These trailers were called: America, England, France and Germany. The trailers suggest that the countries are locations for the game.
On May 23, 2011, the reveal trailer was released.
On May 31, 2011, Activision announced "Call of Duty Elite". This is a social service for the "Call of Duty" community to compare progress, create videos and access premium content. The service will work with "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3" and it will be launched at the same time as the game. On June 6, 2011, the first gameplay demo of the game was presented by Robert Bowling and Glen Schofield at E3 2011. On June 14, 2011, the first live gameplay demo of the new "Survival Mode" was played by Jimmy Fallon and Simon Pegg on "Late Night With Jimmy Fallon". On August 9, 2011, the trailer for the new "Survival Mode" was released on YouTube. On September 2, 2011, the multiplayer world premiere trailer was released on YouTube. On September 2-3, 2011, Activision held a two-day event called "Call of Duty: Experience 2011", in Los Angeles, CA, to promote the game.
"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3" sold 6.8 million copies in the US and UK alone and grossed $470 million within 24 hours. It grossed more than $775 million globally in the first 5 days. "Modern Warfare 3" also topped the UK video game sales chart in the first seven days. By November 21, 2011, the game was the bestselling title in the United Kingdom, sales dropping by 87%. "Modern Warfare 3" was still the top spot on the UK charts in the third and fourth week. The PS3 version of "Modern Warfare 3" also topped the Japanese chart in its first week on sale. The PS3 version sold 180,372 copies, while the Xbox 360 version sold around 30,000.

Randy Roth

Randy Roth (born December 26, 1954) is an American murderer and thief from Washington. He was found guilty of the 1991 murder of his fourth wife, Cynthia Baumgartner Roth. Police thought he killed his second wife, Janis Roth, in 1981 but he was never put on trial for that. He was also found guilty of stealing from the place he worked, from an insurance company, and from Social Security. He was sent to jail for first degree murder in 1992.
Janis Miranda married Roth in March 1981. They were both divorced and raising a child on their own. While they were dating Janis and Randy seemed to be a very happy couple. They seemed to be very much in love. After they got married, they were not like that anymore. Janis' friends saw that she did not seem as happy as she had before. Randy made sure they had a large amount of life insurance. He said he wanted to be able to pay the bills if something bad happened.
On the day after Thanksgiving 1981, something bad did happen. Janis fell to her death from a cliff at a place called Beacon Rock. Randy Roth was the only person who saw what happened. What he told the police and rescue workers who came to look for her did not always make sense. They could not find Janis for many hours. When they found her, she was not below the spot that Randy Roth said she fell from. The police thought Randy might have pushed Janis off a cliff but they could not prove it. The same day as the fall, Randy made sure Janis would cremated. The next day he made sure he would get paid the insurance money. What he did not do was tell Janis' family and friends that she was dead. He did not even tell her own daughter for a whole week.
Roth had been married three times by the time he met Cynthia Baumgartner in 1990. Baumgartner was also a single parent. Her husband had died of Hodgkin's Disease in 1985. Randy Roth only told her about his own dead wife because she did not believe in divorce. He never told her that he had been divorced twice. Cynthia found out that Roth felt a need to control everything in her life. He did not want her doing anything on her own. Her friends saw that the way she looked and how clean her house was not as good as they used to be. They thought that Cynthia was sorry she had married Randy Roth. Roth was also abusive to all three of the boys in their house. 
On July 23, 1991, they took Cynthia's two sons on a day trip to a big lake called Lake Sammamish. This is the same lake where Ted Bundy had kidnapped two young women years before. It was hot when the Roths arrived and the beach was crowded. Randy and Cynthia left the boys to play in the swimming area while they paddled their inflatable raft into deeper waters. Several hours later Randy Roth came back with Cynthia. She was either dead or dying from drowning. Lifeguards and paramedics tried to save her and take her to a hospital. She was dead when she got there. Randy Roth said that waves caused by a motorboat made the raft flip over and that Cynthia drowned because of that.
The police noticed that Randy Roth did not seem very upset that his wife was dead. He also did not always tell the story of how she died the same way. They began to think he might have killed her. Once again they could not prove it right away. Just like when Janis had died, he did not tell her friends and family but he did start trying to collect money from the insurance company right away. He had Cynthia cremated even though her parents did not want him to. After a while, he thought he was not going to get in any trouble but on October 8, 1991 he was arrested for murdering Cynthia.
The police knew it was going to be hard to get a jury to believe that Randy Roth killed his wife. Nobody but Roth saw what happened and there was no way to find anything at the place where she died since it was in a lake. They talked to the families of his other wives and his friends and neighbors. They began to think he did it for money. They also thought that he stole from people he worked for. Lori Baker was a friend of Cynthia's. She found out that Cynthia's will was missing and that Randy Roth was the last person to open the safe deposit box where it had been. Luckily there was another copy. When they read it they found out that Cynthia wanted her friend Lori and not Randy Roth to raise her sons if she died. This made Randy Roth very angry. He was hoping to get money from Social Security that they pay to children whose parents die in accidents. When Lori Baker came to get the boy's stuff from Randy's house, he yelled at her and would not let her take some of the stuff.
Neighbors and an old friend of Roth told the police that Roth had faked burglaries to get money from the insurance company. A girl he had lived next door to told them she had sex with Randy when she was only fifteen years old. They said they never told anyone these things before because they were scared Randy Roth might do something to them.
Roth had claimed that he had served in the Marines in a special forces unit in the Vietnam War. He also said he had been taught how to kill someone with no weapons and without leaving any marks on them. Randy Roth had been in the Marines, but he worked as a file clerk in Okinawa. He had never been to Vietnam or fought in a war. His mother helped him get out of the Marines early. 
The police also talked to people about the death of Janis Roth ten years earlier. They met the police who had investigated it. They found out that there were a lot of things that were the same. He had said things that did not match up with other things he said. He did not seem as upset as most people would be if their wife died. He had her cremated right away. It seemed like he had killed two of his wives and done other criminal things. A judge decided they could arrest him and search his house. When they searched, they found many things that should not have been there. Most of these things belonged to the place where Randy Roth worked. He had stolen them. They also found receipts from when Randy Roth had bought things he said he was given by the Marines for fighting in Vietnam. In the garage, they found a poem that Cynthia wrote about how Randy did not really love her. They also found out that Randy Roth had called someone on the telephone. Those people got to the house before the police and took some of the stolen things out of the house.
The police had the raft that Randy said had flipped over. They took it back to the same place at the lake and tried to get a boat to make a wave big enough to make it flip over. They could not get the boat to flip over. They threw bags of things into the lake that Randy said he had got back out after he got Cynthia back in the raft. They found out that the things sank too fast for that to be true. They also found out that Randy had a brother who was already in jail for killing a woman, and that Randy had been to jail for stealing. They talked to the people from Social Security and found he had told them lies to try and get money. They felt like they found out about a lot of dishonest things Randy did that would make him look bad in court.
Randy Roth's lawyer tried to stop the trial. When that did not work, he tried to get the judge to tell the other lawyers that they could not tell the jury about the other crimes Randy Roth did. That did not work either. 
Randy's lawyer told the jury that he was just unlucky. The prosecutor said he was greedy and did not care about anyone but himself. 
Over one hundred people got up and talked about Randy Roth. One of them told how he had taught Randy how to scuba dive and that he was a very good swimmer. Roth had told the police that he was not good at swimming. People who were at the lake said that when Randy came back with Cynthia that he was not in a hurry or very upset about his wife drowning. Jalina Miranda was the daughter of Janis Roth. She told them how Randy did not tell her for a week that her mother was dead and that he stole money from her. They also heard the poem that Cynthia wrote about how Randy did not love her.
Randy Roth took the stand and talked for twenty hours. It took almost a week before they were done asking him questions. The prosecutor tried to get him to talk about all the lies he had told about Vietnam and other things. He could not lie that any longer but he said that he was telling the truth about how Cynthia died. He never got upset or angry about anything and still did not seem sad about his wife dying. 
Eight and a half hours after the trial ended, the jury came back and said he was guilty of murdering his wife and stealing.
Beacon Rock, where Janis fell and died, was in a place called Skamania County. They said if Randy Roth went to jail for more than fifty years they would not put him on trial for killing Janis. Trials cost much money and Skamania County did not want to use that money if Roth was going to be put in jail for more than 50 years already. The judge said Randy would go to jail for fifty-one years. Fifty years for killing Cynthia and one year for stealing. He will not be able to get parole until at least 2029. Lori Baker, the friend who took in Cynthia Roth's sons, went to court to make sure that Rany Roth and his family did not get any money from the insurance company or from selling Randy and Cynthia's house. Two books were written about Randy Roth and the murder. These books were "A Rose for Her Grave" by Ann Rule and "Fatal Charm" by Carlton Smith.

Voir dire

Voir dire () is a name for the process of choosing jurors for a trial. It can also mean a small meeting between lawyers and a judge during a trial. It originally referred to an oath taken by jurors to tell the truth (). In the modern court systems, voir dire is a process governed by state and federal laws. It is basically designed to find biases in jurors. It has other uses depending on the court system.
The origin of the legal term voir dire is Anglo-Norman. It was an oath given to members of a jury. Witnesses are usually sworn in with the oath: "The evidence you shall give... shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth...". The voir dire oath was: "you shall true answer make to all such questions the court shall demand of you..." In the United States the history of voir dire goes back to the Massachusetts Jury Selection Law of 1760. Many cases that went to trial involved seditious libel. British officials in the colonies put anyone on trial who printed anything criticizing British rule. To get every conviction possible, the British government made sure to only pick jurors who would convict the defendant. The sheriff was made responsible to select a list of jurors favorable to the British crown. To counter this, the 1760 Massachusetts law required the list the sheriff used to be selected by a town meeting. In those public meetings prospective jurors were questioned about any biases they might have. Defendants were also able to question possible jurors before they were selected. This voir dire process made jury selection fair. In 1774 the British Parliament cancelled the 1760 Massachusetts law. They left jury selection up to the court. This gave the crown a free hand in making sure trials ended the way they wanted. But, two years later the Americans declared their independence. The American system of voir dire was developed from that time on.
Voir dire is an opportunity for lawyers to get the best juries for their client. This can become very involved. The process begins as the potential jurors enter the courtroom. The lawyers or their paralegals study the jury panel. They watch body language. They watch who jurors talk to or sit next to. There is a great deal of psychology used in jury selections. Juror behavior can be as important as their answers to questions. The voir dire questions are designed to reveal how a potential juror thinks. For example, books potential jurors read can reveal how they might vote. Also, lawyers try to give each juror individual attention while their paralegal takes notes. Eye contact, body language and attitude are all carefully studied during the interview. 
In the United States voir dire is used to eliminate jurors who may have been influenced by pretrial publicity. But there are some indications it may do just the opposite if jurors are asked what their opinions are as to what the outcome should be. Outside the United States pretrial publicity is handled differently. Judges can order individuals not to talk about the trial while it is in progress. This is the case in Australia and Canada.
Judges have a great deal of discretion (choices) in the voir dire process. In some courts the judge conducts voir dire. In other situations it is left entirely to the lawyers. In some cases it is a combination of both. Jurors are usually not quite as honest in answering voir dire questions with a judge as they are with a lawyer.
In some courts lawyers are given the chance to interview expert witnesses before they testify. An expert witness is anyone who has specialized or expert knowledge of a subject more than an average person would have. Sometimes an expert can be interrupted in his or her testimony for a voir dire to challenge their expertise. If a judge feels the challenge was successful, he can tell the jury to ignore the testimony.
In the United Kingdom voir dire is not used for jury selection. It is used to decide what evidence can and cannot be presented during the trial. This can include confessions made to the police. In Australia and Canada, voir dire is used as a sub-trial within a trial to examine evidence. It is usually done with the jury absent from the courtroom. In Canada, voir dire can also be used to challenge a particular juror for cause (for a specific reason). But cases of challenging a juror under voir dire are rare in Canada.

Doric order

Doric order was one of the three orders of architecture in Ancient Greece; the other two orders were Corinthian order and Ionic order. The order was named after the style of columns used in buildings. It included the base, the shaft, the top (capital), and the part supported at the top; the architrave, the frieze and the cornice. Each order has its own style.
Doric was the earliest style and used by the Greeks for most of their buildings and temples, including the Parthenon. It is believed that the style was first made using wood. The style features heavy columns, a saucer shaped capital on the top, and no base.
The columns (17) are fluted (18), which means they have about 20 grooves cut into them. The top of the column, the capital (14) is made up of a group of annulets. The saucer shaped piece is called the echinus (16). Above this is a square piece of stone, called the abacus (15), on the top. This supports the entablature, which is about one third of the height of the column. This is made up of a plain architrave (13) and a frieze with triglyphs (8). Between the triglyphs are square spaces, called metopes (9), which can be used for sculptures. Above this is a cornice with large blocks called mutules (5), which overhang the frieze. The lower surface of these blocks are called the soffit. Above this the block of stone has a plain vertical face called the corona. It is finished on the top with more decorations.
Parts of the frieze sculptures from the Parthenon were removed in the 1800's and taken to the British Museum. They are known as the Elgin Marbles.

He played 5 seasons with the Quebec Nordiques, 2 seasons with the Washington Capitals and 4 seasons with the Buffalo Sabres. He is probably best known for the serious throat injury that he received from a skate blade when Steve Tuttle of the St. Louis Blues and Uwe Krupp of the Buffalo Sabres became entangled when they were chasing the puck and they both crashed into Malarchuk's net, Tuttle's skate hit Malarchuk on the neck and severed his internal carotid artery which caused puddles of blood that collected on the ice. Malarchuk left the ice on his own two feet but he thought he was going to die so he said "All I wanted to do was get off the ice". "My mother was watching the game on TV, and I didn't want her to see me die." He knew that his mother was watching the game on TV and he had an equipment manager call and tell her he loved her. He also asked for a priest. His life was saved when the team's trainer, Jim Pizzutelli who was a former Army medic who had served in Vietnam. had reached into Malarchuk's neck and pinched off the bleeding. He did not let go until the doctors arrived to begin closing the wound. After the doctors spent 90 minutes and used over 300 stitches to close the wound he returned to practice four days later and was back in the net against the Quebec Nordiques after about a week. He said, "Doctors told me to take the rest of the year off, but there was no way", "The longer you wait, the harder it's going to be. I play for keeps". He made in time for the playoffs but the Sabres lost to the Boston Bruins 4 games to 1.

Redwood

The redwood trees are a subfamily (Sequoioideae) in the family Cupressaceae, the cypress trees. There are three living genera in the subfamily. There were once more species of redwood trees, but most have become extinct. 
These trees are pyrophytes, which means they have adapted to protect themselves from fire. Because fire is common in the regions where they grow, redwood trees have developed thick, fire-resistant bark. Their cones open only after a fire. Due to better fire control in modern times, these trees are endangered.
Redwood trees can grow to be very large. The largest species, "Sequoiadendron giganteum," can reach up to 94.8 m tall and 17 m across. The tallest tree in the world is a "Sequoia sempervirens" named Hyperion. The largest tree in the world by volume is a "Sequoiadendron giganteum" named the General Sherman Tree, after William Tecumseh Sherman.

King Creole

King Creole is an American movie directed by Michael Curtiz, released by Paramount Pictures on July 2, 1958. The movie stars Elvis Presley, Carolyn Jones, and Walter Matthau. It is Presley's fourth movie (the third and last filmed in black & white). It was based on the 1952 novel by Harold Robbins, "A Stone for Danny Fisher".
Presley plays a teenager named Danny Fisher, who is forced to drop out of school to help support his father (Dean Jagger). Always in trouble, Danny is saved from a jail term by New Orleans saloon-keeper Charlie Le Grand (Paul Stewart), who gives the boy a job as a singer. Soon a local gang boss, Maxie Fields (Walter Matthau), a shadowy figure from Danny's criminal past, puts pressure on the boy, insisting that Danny sing at his saloon. To tempt Danny, Maxie relies upon the seductive charms of his girlfriend Ronnie (Carolyn Jones), while Danny's true love Nellie (Dolores Hart) suffers on the sidelines.
Hal Wallis purchased the rights to "A Stone For Danny Fisher" so he could make a non-musical movie starring either James Dean or Ben Gazzara. After Dean died in 1955, the project did not continue. In January 1957, following the success of an Off-Broadway stage version of the story, Presley's name was suggested as a possible replacement. The character of Fisher was changed from a boxer to a singer and the story was moved from New York to New Orleans. 
With filming starting in January 1958, Presley had to get special permission to delay his entry to the US Army, until after filming was complete.
Michael Curtiz, a noted director during the golden era of the Hollywood studio system was hired for the project. His famous movies included "The Adventures of Robin Hood" in 1938, "Yankee Doodle Dandy" in 1942, and in the same year, "Casablanca", 
After seeing an early copy of the movie Presley thanked Curtiz for giving him the chance to show people he could be an actor. "King Creole" was said to have been Presley's favorite role of his entire career. He had high hopes of returning from the Army to pick up from where he had left off. However, despite success of the movie, he never got the chance to be taken as seriously as an actor again, with the exception of the westerns "Charro!" and "Flaming Star". This was partly due to the success of later movies such as "Blue Hawaii", "G.I. Blues", and "Viva Las Vegas". These were all quick to make, low cost box-office hits. They had enough songs to sell soundtrack albums and entertain the thousands of Presley fans who were more eager to see him sing than act.
"King Creole" was the last movie Presley made during the 1950's and is often said to be his best role. 
Filming took place between January 20 and March 12 1958. Twelve days after the finishing "King Creole", Presley joined the U.S. Army.

Rolling in the Deep

"Rolling in the Deep" is a song by English singer-songwriter Adele. It is from her second studio album, "21". The song was written by Adele and Paul Epworth. Adele has described it as a "dark blues-y gospel disco tune". It was released as the lead single on 29 November 2010 in the Netherlands. "Rolling in the Deep'" became Adele's first number-one hit single in the United States and Canada. It was also her first top-five hit in several countries.
Critics have given positive reviews for the song. It reached number one in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. It also reached top ten in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, and Norway. The song debuted at number two in the United Kingdom. There, it became Adele's third top-ten single.
"Rolling in the Deep" became Adele's second single to chart in the United States. After that, it became her first single to go to top of a "Billboard" chart. This was when it reached number one on the Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks chart in March 2011. It also became her first number one hit in the country when the song reached #1 in the "Billboard" Hot 100 in May 2011. As of May 2011, "Rolling in the Deep" had sold over 2 million digital copies in the US. The song is her best-selling single in the country. It has sold more copies than her previous best-selling single "Chasing Pavements".
The song has "martial arts", "pounding piano keys" (played by Neil Crowley) and "chanting backing singers". Critics have said Adele's vocals are like Wanda Jackson's "dirty-blues growl." AOL Radio Blog's Nadine Cheung says the song is "sung from the perspective of a scorned lover, who is finally able to see the light, but despite regretful sentiments, reconciliation is not an option here."
The song was praised by critics for Adele's powerful voice, the lyrics and the song's instrumentation. "The Sun" called the song an "epic, foot-stomper of a pop anthem." They said it had a thumping piano. According to "The Sun", Adele's vocals seemed to be that of a veteran who has been singing for 20 years . Bill Lamb from About.com gave it 5 stars out of 5. He praised her voice and the emotion with which she sang the song. He said the song could "raise chills up the spine." He added that after hearing the song, people would want to hear the full album. Jason Lipshutz from "Billboard" praised the chorus of the song and its instrumentation. Lipshutz praised Adele's vocal performance. He said Adele was confident about her vocal ability. Lipshutz praised the way Adele started the chorus of the song. "Rolling Stone"s Barry Walters gave "Rolling in the Deep" a positive review. He said Adele's voice was "powerful but not particularly pop" in the song. He said that the song started with "a stroked acoustic guitar." But he described its end as "stomping" and one that has hand-clapping. He said this showed that the English liked to modify Black American roots music.
The music video was premiered on Channel 4 on 3 December 2010.

Artesian aquifer

An artesian aquifer is an underground layer which holds groundwater under pressure. This causes the water level in the well to rise to a point where the pressure is equal to the weight of water putting it under pressure. This type of well is called an artesian well. Water may even reach the ground surface if the natural pressure is high enough, in which case the well is called a flowing artesian well. 
An aquifer is a geologic layer which can hold water such as sand and gravel, limestone, or sandstone, through which water flows and is stored. An artesian aquifer is trapped between rocks or clay which causes the pressure. Water returns to the aquifers when the water table at its recharge zone is at a higher elevation than the head of the well. 
Fossil water aquifers can also be artesian if they are under sufficient pressure from the surrounding rocks. This is similar to how many newly tapped oil wells are pressurized.
Artesian wells were named after the old province of Artois in France, where many artesian wells were drilled by Carthusian monks from 1126.
There are artesian aquifers in many countries including Australia, the USA, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, Fiji and Canada. The Great Artesian Basin is the largest and deepest artesian basin in the world, occupying 23% of the Australian continent.

<doc id="295795" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295795" title="Molecular vibrations">
Molecular vibrations

Molecular vibrations are one of three different kinds of motion for molecules that include translational motion (when the whole molecule goes in the same direction) and rotational motion (when the molecule spins like a top)
A vibrational motion for a molecule is when the bonds between atoms within a molecule move. Think of the atoms as round balls that are attached by a spring that can stretch back and forth. An example of this motion is "stretching", the simplest example of a vibration for a molecule and occurs between just two atoms. Some examples of molecules that are like this include hydrogen H, nitrogen N and oxygen O
If the molecule has more than two atoms, then things get more complicated. Suppose just one more atom is added so now there are three atoms like in water HO where the two hydrogen atoms are both attached to the central oxygen atom. Remember with hydrogen there was one kind of stretching, but in water there are two kinds of stretching and four other kinds of vibration called bending vibrations as shown below.
The atoms in a CH group or molecules like water can vibrate in six different ways: symmetric and antisymmetric stretching, scissoring, rocking, wagging and twisting:
symmetric stretching: when the two attached atoms move away and toward the central atom at the same time.
antisymmetric stretching: When the two attached atoms do not move away and toward the central atom at the same time.
scissoring: Just like the name says scissoring is when the two atoms move away and toward each other
rocking: This motion is like a pendulum on a clock going back and forth only here an atom is the pendulum and there are two instead of one.
wagging: If a person holds up their hand in front of them and puts there two fingers in a "V" sign and bend there wrist toward and away from them. Here the tips of the fingers are the attached atoms and the wrist is the central atom.
twisting: This motion is like a person is walking on a treadmill where their waist is the central atom and their feet are the two attached atoms
Molecules with more than three atoms are even more complicated and have even more vibrations which are sometimes called "vibrational modes". Each new vibrational mode is basically a different combination of the six shown above. The more atoms in the molecule the more ways they can be combined. For most molecules with N atoms the number of possible vibrations for that molecule is 3N - 6 while linear molecules, or molecules with there atoms in a straight line, have 3N-5 vibrational modes.
Using Newtonian mechanics the vibrations of a molecule can be calculated by treating the bonds like springs. This is useful because like a spring, a bond requires energy to stretch it out and it also takes energy to squeeze it together. The energy needed to stretch or squeeze the bond is dependent on the stiffness of the bond, which is represented by the "spring constant" k, and the reduced mass, or "center of mass" of the two atoms attached to either end denoted by "μ". The formula used to relate the energy needed to cause a vibration in the bond is:
"h": is planck's constant
ν: is frequency and represents the rate at which the bond is squished together and pulled apart again. The larger ν the faster this rate becomes.
Ε: is the energy required to push and pull the bond together.
"μ": The reduce mass is the two masses of the atoms multiplied together and divided by their addition:
Using quantum mechanics, the formula that describes the spring is exactly the same as the Newtonian mechanics version except only certain energies or energy levels are allowed. Think of the energy levels as steps on a ladder where a person can only go up or down one rung at a time. Just as that person can't stand on the space between rungs so the bond can not have an energy between energy levels. This new formula becomes:
where "n" is a quantum number or "energy level" that can take values of 0, 1, 2 ... 
The statement that energy levels can only go up or down one level at a time is known as a selection rule which states that the only allowed transitions between energy levels are:
where \Delta n is the energy transition.
When light of a certain frequency hits a molecule that has a vibration whose motion corresponds to the same frequency then the light gets absorbed into the molecule and the energy from the light causes the bonds to move in that specific vibrational motion. By checking for light that gets absorbed, scientists can tell if a certain kind of molecular bond is there and match it against a list of molecules that have that bond.
However, some molecules like helium and argon have only one atom and don't have any bonds. This means that they won't absorb any light in the same way a molecule with more than one atom can.
The specific fields of chemistry that use molecular vibrations in their studies include infrared spectroscopy (IR) and Raman spectroscopy (Raman) with IR being more widely used and having three subfields of its own. These subfields are known as Near IR, Mid IR and Far IR spectroscopy. The following is a general list of these fields and real world applications
Near IR: quantitative determination of species such as proteins, fats, low low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons and water. Further use is obtained in the agricultural products, food, petroleum and chemical industries
Mid IR:The most popular of the IR fields, is used in determining structure of organic and biochemical compounds.
Far IR: this field is less popular though it has found uses in inorganic studies
Raman: Is used for the qualitative and quantitative study of inorganic, organic and biological systems often as a complimentary technique to IR.

Four Asian Tigers

The Four Asian Tigers or Asian Dragons are the highly developed economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. These regions were the first newly industrialized countries. They are known because they had very high growth rates (they became rich very fast) and fast industrialization between the early 1960s and 1990s. Now people say that all four economies are rich economies. 
All four Asian Tigers have a highly educated and productive work force compared to others in the region.
The economic success stories of Korea and Taiwan became known as the Miracle on the Han River and the Taiwan Miracle. This helped many developing countries think maybe they could become rich too, especially the Tiger Cub economies.
The four tigers grew richer very quickly. Some of this was because these countries let companies compete more, and some of this was because they started to sell more to other countries. The United States helped during the Cold War, because they didn't want these countries to become communist countries.
All the Asian Tigers tried to export (sell) things to rich industrialized nations. They grew rich very quickly (they had double-digit economic growth) for decades. Each nation was not a democracy, and people were not very free in the early years. All of these countries later became freer, and people now think Taiwan and Korea are liberal democracies 
In 1997, people started to invest (spend) money on things they shouldn't, and that hurt the economies of those countries. But now these countries are getting richer again.

BRIC

BRIC is used to talk about the countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China. Many economists think that all these countries are at a similar stage of economic development. When people write about these countries, they usually write "BRICs" or the "BRIC countries".
The acronym was invented by Jim O'Neill, an economist who worked for Goldman Sachs. In 2001, he wrote an article that he called "Building Better Global Economic BRICs".
Mexico and South Korea were the only other countries with economies that are like the BRICs. But O'Neill did not include these countries because they were considered already more developed, as they were already members of the OECD.

Non-Aligned Movement

The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) is an international organization (group of countries) who do not want to be officially aligned (friends) with or against any major power bloc (group of countries). In 2012, the movement had 120 members and 15 observer countries. 
The group was started in Belgrade in 1961. It was created by Yugoslavia's President, Josip Broz Tito, India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, Egypt's second President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah, and Indonesia's first President, Sukarno. All five leaders believed that developing countries should not help either the Western or Eastern blocs in the Cold War. They also believed that developing countries should not be capitalist or communist, but should try to find a different way to help their people.
The "Havana Declaration of 1979" said that the purpose is the organization is to help countries keep their "the national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of non-aligned countries" in their "struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, and all forms of foreign aggression, occupation, domination, interference or hegemony as well as against great power and bloc politics." This means that they wanted to govern their countries without the capitalist or communist countries telling them how.
The countries of the non-aligned movement are nearly two-thirds of the United Nations's members and 55% of the world population.
Between summits, the Non-Aligned Movement is run by the secretary-general elected at last summit meeting. As a considerable part of the movement's work is undertaken at the United Nations in New York, the chair country's ambassador to the UN is expected to devote time and effort to matters concerning the Non-Aligned Movement. The Coordinating Bureau, also based at the UN, is the main instrument for directing the work of the movement's task forces, committees and working groups.
The following countries and organizations have observer status:

Economic development

Economic development is the growth of the standard of living of a country's people from a "low-income" (poor) country to a "high-income" (rich) economy. When the local "quality of life" is improved, there is more economic development.
When social scientists study economic development, they look at a lot of things. They want to know about the waves of economic development used by historians. They also want to know how development is happening today. They want to know why people "invest" (spend money hoping they will make money) more money in some countries than in others. They also want to know why people are better at making things to sell in some countries than in others.
 for people with color blindness.
One way to measure economic development is "human development.
"Human development" is very important, and includes the health of the people and their education. This usually goes together with "economic growth." As people in a country become healthier and get better education, they also usually get richer, because healthy, educated workers are more "productive" (better at making things), and richer workers can afford health and education.
The Human Development Index looks at how long people live, how well people read, how many people go to school, and how much money people make.
Economists also look at the "rate of growth", which is how fast a country gets richer.

The term newly industrialized country (NIC) is a socioeconomic classification used by political scientists and economists to talk about several countries around the world.
NICs are countries who still are not developed countries but are doing better than other developing countries. NICs have fast growing economies, and export a lot. In NICs many things in the country change quickly as people from the country move to the cities to take jobs in factories.
NICs usually share some other common features, including:
NICs often receive support from international organizations such as the WTO and other internationl support bodies. However, as environmental, labor and social standards tend to be significantly weaker in NICs, many fair trade supporters have advocated standards for importing their products and criticized the outsourcing of jobs to NICs.

<doc id="295876" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295876" title="Lilly Pulitzer">
Lilly Pulitzer

Lillian Pulitzer Rousseau (Lillian Lee McKim; November 10, 1931 – April 7, 2013), better known as Lilly Pulitzer, was an American fashion designer. She is known for founding Lilly Pulitzer, Inc., which makes clothes with bright, colorful patterns. Because the brand has been very popular with rich people, Lilly has been called the "Queen of Prep".
Lillian Lee McKim, nicknamed Lilly, was born on November 10, 1931 in Roslyn, New York. Her father was Robert V. McKim and her mother was Lillian McKim (maiden name Bostwick). She was the middle child, with an older sister named Mary Maude and younger sister named Florence Fitch. Her mother, Lillian, was an heir to the Standard Oil fortune. Lillian divorced Robert and married Ogden Phipps in 1937.
Lilly went to the Chapin School in New York City, along with Bouvier sister Jacqueline. In 1949, she graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut. She attended the college-finishing school Finch College in New York City, but left after one semester to work as a midwife's assistant in West Virginia and later as a volunteer at the Veterans Hospital in The Bronx. 
In 1950, she married Peter Pulitzer, the grandson of publisher Joseph Pulitzer. They moved to Palm Beach, where Lilly started her clothing company, Lilly Pulitzer, Inc. In 1969, Lilly and Peter were divorced. She married Enrique Rousseau soon after. She legally changed her name to Lillian Rousseau, but her clothing company kept the "Lilly Pulitzer" label. Lilly continued to live in Palm Beach. Enrique died from cancer in 1993.
Lilly has three children from her marriage to Peter: Peter, Minnie, and Liza. Peter lives in Bridgehampton, New York, with his wife, Elise, and five children: Fiona, Caleb, Stefan, Aaron, and Daniella. Liza currently lives in West Palm Beach, Florida, with her husband, Henry, and three children: Waverly, Hattie and Rayna. Liza is currently helping out in Florida with the Lilly Pulitzer Brand.
Pulitzer died on April 7, 2013 in her home in Palm Beach, California from natural causes, at age 81.
Lilly and Peter settled in Palm Beach, Florida, shortly after their marriage. Peter owned several Florida citrus groves, and with fruit from the groves Lilly opened a juice stand on Via Mizner, just off Worth Avenue in Palm Beach.
In the course of working at the juice stand, Lilly found that squeezing juice made a mess of her clothes. Seeking to hide the juice stains, she designed a sleeveless shift dress made of bright, colorful printed cotton. Lilly found that customers loved her dress, so she made more to sell at her juice stand. Eventually, she was selling more dresses than juice, and decided to focus on making and selling what had become known as her "Lillys".
In 1959, Lilly became president of her own company, Lilly Pulitzer, Inc. The company's main factory was located in Miami, Florida and the fabrics were produced by the Key West Hand Print Fabrics company in Key West.
From the 1960s to the early 1980s, Lilly's bright, colorful clothes were very popular, worn by rich people such as First Lady Jackie Kennedy, and members of the Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and Whitney families. However, by 1984, Lilly felt she was not having as much fun as she used to and retired, closing down her entire clothing business.
In 1993, the rights to the Lilly Pulitzer brand were bought by Sugartown Worldwide, Inc. They contacted Lilly with the hopes of bringing back the brand because, "they just loved Lilly, their mothers and sisters loved Lilly, and they wanted to bring the line back," according to Lilly herself. Lilly is not involved in the day to day running of the company, but she continues to do things like approve new designs, fabrics, and collections. 
Today, the company has 75 Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores (also known as Via Stores), several company-owned retail stores, sells to independently owned stores and is in major department stores such as Bloomingdales, Lord and Taylor, Nordstrom, and Neiman Marcus. On December 21, 2010, Sugartown Worldwide, Inc. was bought by Oxford Industries, Inc.
Along with women's clothing, the company also makes men's clothing, children's clothing, maternity clothes, shoes, jewelry, accessories, bedding (revived in 2010), and stationery. The company started a bridal collection in 2010.
Lilly Pulitzer has made special collections with sorority prints on them, among them Kappa Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Delta Delta Delta, and Delta Zeta. She has held contests on her Facebook page to vote on which sororities will get their own prints.
Lisa Birnbach's humorous "guides", "The Official Preppy Handbook" and its sequel "True Prep: It’s a Whole New Old World", say Lilly Pulitzer clothing is a must-have item for "preppy" women.
The Museum of Lifestyle & Fashion History in Boynton Beach, Florida, ran an exhibit from August 2010 through May 2011 about the clothing and designs of Lilly Pulitzer. Museum director Lori Durante stated "Lilly Pulitzer fashion is relative to the American experience ... It is relevant to Palm Beach County, to Florida."

Space Shuttle Columbia disaster

The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster occurred when Space Shuttle Columbia broke up when it was reentering the atmosphere on February 1, 2003. The cause of the disaster was that a piece of foam broke from the external fuel tank. This made a hole in the shuttle's wing. During its entry, hot gases entered the wing, causing it to break up. All of the people on board died when it broke up.
Parts of "Columbia" were found across the state of Texas. The government of the United States has told people who find parts of the Space Shuttle to return the parts to the government. If they do not give the parts back they may face legal penalties. Even today parts are still being found. All of the found parts are currently in a building owned by NASA. NASA is trying to get all of the parts. They want to figure out the cause of the accident. They hope getting the parts back will help them do this.

Fraternities and sororities

Fraternities and sororities are social groups for college students, though sometimes high schools have them too. They exist mostly in the United States and Europe. The words "frater" and "soror" are Latin for "brother" and "sister" and used to show closeness between members. They also denote whether the group is for men or women. Sororities are only for women. Fraternities are primarily for men, but less often, a fraternity can be for both men and women.
Fraternities and sororities often have groups at many different schools. Each fraternity or sorority is given two or three Greek letters to call themselves, for example, ΑΦ (Alpha Phi) or ΑΧΩ (Alpha Chi Omega). To tell the difference between groups at different schools, called chapters, each chapter is given another set of Greek letters. For example, a man in the Kappa Sigma fraternity who goes to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette is part of the fraternity's EX (Epsilon Chi) chapter. Chapters sometimes have houses on or near the campus of the college the members attend that members can live in.
Fraternities and sororities often participate in community service.
Fraternities and sororities are often exclusive, meaning people who want to join need to be invited to do so. This is done during a process called "rushing". During a rush, people who want to join a chapter will talk to current members. If the member think the person rushing is a good fit for the group, they will get an invitation, called a "bid", to join the chapter. If the person rushing accepts, they become a "pledge".
The pledging period is a time when the pledge is not yet a full member, and may leave or be refused membership at any time. Sometimes, members of the chapter will put the pledge through trials. Sometimes they are tests on the history of the fraternity they are trying to join, wearing a badge with the fraternity's letters on it at all times, or performing public service. Sometimes the trials are cruel, dangerous or humiliating. If the trials are cruel, it is called "hazing". Hazing is illegal in 44 states.
After the pledging period, the pledge becomes a full member of the chapter and fraternity or sorority.

Fire ecology

Fire ecology is about the effects of fire on the ecosystems where it occurs. The results of fire are studied, and also what causes the fires. 
In many ecosystems, fire helps keep the habitat healthy. Examples of such habitats are the North American prairie and chaparral ecosystems, and the South African savanna. In these ecosystems, fire helps renew the habitat. In theses places, many plants and trees have adapted and need fire to grow well, or for their seeds to germinate.
If the fires are stopped, dry wood and dead plants accumulate. Bushes and trees that catch fire easily will start growing. When this area finally does catch fire, it will make the wildfire larger and more damaging, and be harder to control.
In the United States, campaigns have made people believe that wildfires are always bad for nature. This comes from the old belief that ecosystems grow towards a stable system, and disturbances like fires stop that, and destroy the harmony of nature. But we have since learned that in some areas, fire is needed to make the system work properly; fire also helps biodiversity of many habitats. The plants and animals in these habitats have adapted to protect themselves from fire, and sometimes must have fire to survive.
Still, fire can kill people or burn down buildings. Now, controlled burns are sometimes done to have fire where it is needed, but don't let it go where it can cause damage to people or their property.

<doc id="295972" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295972" title="Seed fern">
Seed fern

The term seed ferns (Pteridospermatophyta) are several distinct groups of extinct seed plants (spermatophytes). 
The oldest fossil evidence of plants of this type is from Upper Devonian strata, and they flourished particularly during the Carboniferous and Permian periods. 
Pteridosperms declined during the Mesozoic Era and had mostly disappeared by the end of the Cretaceous, though some fossil pteridosperm-like plants seem to have survived into Eocene times in Tasmania. 
The concept of the pteridosperms goes back to the late 19th century when palaeobotanists came to realise that many Carboniferous fossils resembling fern fronds had anatomical features like cycads. 
British palaeobotanists made the critical discovery that some of these fronds were associated with seeds, and concluded that the fronds and seeds belonged to the same plants. 
Initially it was still thought that they were intermediate between the ferns and cycads, and especially in the English-speaking world they were referred to as "seed ferns" or "pteridosperms". Today, most palaeobotanists regard them as being only distantly related to ferns and that these names are misleading, but the names have nevertheless stuck.
Later during the 20th century, the concept of pteridosperms was expanded to include various Mesozoic groups of seed plants with fern-like fronds. Some palaeobotanists also included seed plant groups with entire leaves such as "Glossopteris" and its relatives, which was clearly stretching the concept. 
The seed ferns were by far the earliest seed plants, and must have included the ancestors of the later plants. They are spread across a range of clades and many palaeobotanists today would regard pteridosperms as little more than a paraphyletic 'grade-group'.
So, does the concept of pteridosperms have any value today? Many palaeobotanists still use the term in an informal sense for the seed plants that are not angiosperms, coniferoids (conifers or cordaites), ginkgophytes or cycadophytes (cycads or bennettites). 
This is particularly useful for extinct seed plant groups, whose relationships are unknown. We can call them pteridosperms with no suggestion of being a clade. Also, for curators or collectors, the term 'pteridosperm' is a useful shorthand for describing fern-like fronds probably produced by seed plants, which are often found in Palaeozoic and Mesozoic fossil floras.

Glossopteris

Glossopteris is the largest and best-known genus of the extinct seed ferns.
The Glossopteridales arose in the Southern Hemisphere around the beginning of the Permian (~300 milliom years ago). Their distribution across several continents led Eduard Suess to suggest the southern continents were once together in a single supercontinent – Gondwana. 
These plants went on to become the dominant elements of the southern flora through the rest of the Permian but disappeared in almost all places at the end of the Permian (~250mya). 
The only convincing Triassic records are very earliest Triassic leaves from Nidpur, India. Even these records are somewhat questionable owing to faulting and complex juxtapositioning of Permian and Triassic strata at Nidpur. 
Although most modern palaeobotany textbooks cite the continuation of glossopterids into later parts of the Triassic and, in some cases into the Jurassic, these are mistakes based on misidentification of similar leaves such as those of "Gontriglossa", "Sagenopteris", or "Mexiglossa". 
Glossopterids were, thus, one of the major casualties of the end-Permian mass-extinction event.

Warren Zevon

Warren William Zevon (January 24, 1947 – September 7, 2003) was an American rock singer-songwriter and musician known for including his strange and somewhat critical opinions of life in his lyrics. Zevon wrote many songs that were humorous and often political
Many famous musicians have said they liked Zevon's work, including Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, and Neil Young. His most famous songs include "Werewolves of London", "Lawyers, Guns and Money", "Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner" and "Johnny Strikes Up The Band." All of these are from his third and most famous album: "Excitable Boy" (1978). Zevon has written many songs that were recorded by other artists. These include "Poor Poor Pitiful Me" (a top 40 hit by Linda Ronstadt), "Accidentally Like a Martyr," "Mohammed's Radio," "Carmelita", and "Hasten Down the Wind".
Zevon sometimes recorded or sang cover songs. He liked to sing Bob Dylan's "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" and Leonard Cohen's "First We Take Manhattan". He was often a guest on "Late Night with David Letterman" and the "Late Show with David Letterman". Letterman later sang with Zevon on "Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song)" with Paul Shaffer and members of the CBS Orchestra.
He had a lot of problems in his life, including divorce, alcoholism, and suicide attempts. He also had a paranoia of doctors and this killed him: he did not know he had cancer until doctors could not help him.
Zevon was born in Chicago, Illinois. His parents were to William Zevon, a Secular Jew and Beverly Cope Simmons, a Mormon from Salt Lake City, Utah. They soon moved to Fresno, California. By the age of 13, Zevon sometimes visited Igor Stravinsky where he studied modern classical music. Zevon's parents divorced when he was 16 years old. After the divorce, he dropped out of high school and moved from Los Angeles to New York to become a folk singer.
In 1978, Zevon released his most popular and critically acclaimed album "Excitable Boy". Radio stations often played the songs off the album, especially "Werewolves of London." "Werewolves of London" and "Excitable Boy" were both examples of black humor (jokes about bad things). The album also had the songs "Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner" and "Lawyers, Guns and Money," which were both deadpan humor songs about geopolitics.
"Rolling Stone" named the album one of the most important albums in the 1970s. They said that he, Neil Young, Jackson Browne, and Bruce Springsteen were four of the best new artists to emerge in the 1970s.
After "Excitable Boy" Warren Zevon published "Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School" in 1980. This album had the only other song recorded by Zevon that reached the Billboard Top 100: "A Certain Girl." "A Certain Girl" is a rhythm and blues song written by Allen Toussaint.
This album was dedicated to Ken Millar, who calls himself "Ross Macdonald." Millar is a writer who writes mystery novels, and Zevon really liked Millar's stories. He met Millar in an intervention put together by the journalist Paul Nelson. For awhile this intervention helped Zevon not drink too much alcohol.
Warren Zevon did not like to go to the doctor, and never went to one when he was an adult. Before playing at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival in 2002, he started feeling dizzy and started to have a chronic cough. When Zevon told his dentist his problems, his dentist recommended seeing a doctor. When he finally visited one, the doctor diagnosed him with mesothelmia.
Warren Zevon did not want to get treated for his cancer if it might keep him from making music. So instead he started to make his final album, titled "The Wind". He had a lot of friends who helped him make the album. These friends included Bruce Springsteen, Don Henley, Jackson Browne, Timothy B. Schmit, Joe Walsh, David Lindley, Billy Bob Thornton, Emmylou Harris, Tom Petty, Dwight Yoakam, and others.

Shrew opossum

The order Paucituberculata contains the six surviving species of shrew opossum. "Caenolestes" is the main genus, and the group as a whole may be called 'caenolestids'.
They are small, shrew-like marsupials of the Andes mountains of South America. 
20 million years ago, there were at least seven genera in South America. Today, just three genera remain. They live in inaccessible forest and grassland regions of the high Andes. 
Insectivores were absent from South America until the Great American Interchange three million years ago, and are present now only in the northwestern part of the continent. Shrew opossums have lost ground to the these and other placental invaders that fill the same ecological niches. Nevertheless, the ranges of shrew opossums and insectivores overlap broadly. 
Shrew opossums are about the size of a small rat (9–14 cm long), with thin limbs, a long, pointed snout and a slender, hairy tail. They are largely carnivorous, being active hunters of insects, earthworms and small vertebrates. They have small eyes and poor sight, and hunt in the early evening and at night, using their hearing and long, sensitive whiskers to locate prey. They seem to spend much of their lives in underground burrows and on surface runways. 
Largely because of their rugged, inaccessible habitat, they are very poorly known. Recent studies suggest that they may be more common than had been thought.

<doc id="296061" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=296061" title="Lepidodendron">
Lepidodendron

Lepidodendron is an extinct genus of primitive (tree-like) plant. They were the first large land plants, and a major part of the coal forest tropical flora. 
They were huge, over , and the trunks were often over in diameter. 
Sometimes called 'giant club mosses', they are actually closer to the quillworts "Isoetes" than to clubmosses.
They thrived during the Pennsylvanian sub-period of the Carboniferous 315–300 million years years ago.
The conditions were tropical swamps and rain forests of a huge river system much larger that the Amazon basin. 
The river plain which was the heart of the wetland stretched across Pangaea 5000 km from eastern Canada to the Ukraine, and was 700 km wide. This would make the Pennsylvanian basin larger than any wetlands on Earth today.
The rainforest system collapsed about halfway through the Pennsylvanian, and was replaced by a cooler, drier climate. 
The wetland forests ended when the land level was raised by the pressure of the Gondwana continent against Laurussia, causing the zone of contact to be raised. The end of the Coal Measures marks the end of the Carboniferous period. China was too far away to be affected, and there the wetland forests continued for another 50 million years, into the early Permian.
"Lepidodendron" had tall, thick trunks that rarely branched and were topped with a crown of bifurcating branches bearing clusters of leaves. These leaves were long and narrow, similar to large blades of grass, and were spirally-arranged. 
The closely packed diamond-shaped leaf scars left on the trunk and stems as the plant grew provide some of the most interesting and common fossils in Carboniferous shales and accompanying coal deposits. These fossils look much like tire tracks or alligator skin. 
The scars, or leaf cushions, were composed of green photosynthetic tissue, evidenced by the cuticle covering and being dotted with stomata, microscopic pores through which carbon dioxide from the air diffuses into plants. Likewise, the trunks of "Lepidodendron" would have been green, unlike modern trees which have scaly, non-photosynthetic brown or gray bark.
"Lepidodendron" has been likened to a giant herb. The trunks produced very little, if any, wood. Most structural support came from a thick, bark-like region. This region remained around the trunk as a rigid layer that did not flake off like that of most modern trees. As the tree grew, the leaf cushions expanded to accommodate the increasing width of the trunk.
The branches of this plant ended in cone-like structures. "Lepidodendron" did not produce seeds like many modern plants. Instead, it reproduced by means of spores.
Stigmaria are a type of branching tree root fossil found in Carboniferous rocks. They were the roots of coal forest lycopsid trees such as "Sigillaria" and "Lepidodendron". Each trunk had four of those roots. "Stigmaria" is a "form taxon", as the genus and species of the plant bearing the root cannot be identified.

The two species of marsupial moles are rare and poorly understood burrowing mammals of the deserts of Western Australia.
Marsupial moles spend most of their time underground, coming to the surface only occasionally, probably mostly after rains. They are blind, their eyes having become reduced to vestigial lenses under the skin, and they have no external ears, just a pair of tiny holes hidden under thick hair. They do not dig permanent burrows, filling the tunnel in behind them as they move.

Garret FitzGerald

Garret FitzGerald (9 February 1926– 19 May 2011) was an Irish politician who was twice Taoiseach of Ireland, from July 1981 to February 1982 and again from December 1982 to March 1987. FitzGerald was elected to Seanad Éireann in 1965, and in 1969 to Dáil Éireann as a Fine Gael TD. He served as Foreign Affairs Minister from 1973 to 1977. FitzGerald was the leader of Fine Gael between 1977 and 1987.
He was the son of Desmond FitzGerald, the first Minister for External Affairs of the Irish Free State following independence from the United Kingdom in 1922. At the time of his death, FitzGerald was the President of the Institute of International and European Affairs, had a column in "The Irish Times" and occasionally made appearances on television programmes.
Garret FitzGerald was born in Dublin in 1926 into a very politically active family. His father was Desmond FitzGerald, and was the Minister for External Affairs at the time of his son's birth. FitzGerald senior had been active in Sinn Féin during the Irish War of Independence, and had been one of the founders of Cumann na nGaedheal, the party formed to support the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, which created the Irish Free State.
Although a senior figure on the "pro-treaty" side of Ireland's political divide, Desmond FitzGerald had remained friendly with anti-Treaty republicans such as Belfast man Seán MacEntee, a minister in Éamon de Valera's government, and father-in-law of Conor Cruise O'Brien. The families of Patrick McGilligan and Ernest Blythe were also frequent visitors to the FitzGerald household. FitzGerald's mother, the former Mabel Washington McConnell, was a nationalist and republican of Ulster Protestant descent. Her son would later describe his political objective as the creation of a pluralist Ireland where the northern Protestants of his mother's family tradition and the southern Catholics of his father's could feel equally at home.
Garret FitzGerald was educated at the Jesuit Belvedere College and University College Dublin (UCD), from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1946, later returning to complete a Ph.D. which he obtained in 1968. He was deeply interested in the politics of the Spanish Civil War and World War II. A bright student who counted among his contemporaries in UCD his future political rival, Charles Haughey, who also knew Joan O'Farrell (the Liverpool-born daughter of a British army officer, Richard O'Farrell) a fellow student, whom FitzGerald married in 1947.
Following his university education, in 1947 he started working with Aer Lingus, the state airline of Ireland, and became an authority on the strategic economic planning of transport. During this time he wrote many newspaper articles, was the Irish correspondent for the Economist Magazine, and was encouraged to write on National Accounts and economics by the Features Editor in "The Irish Times". He remained in Aer Lingus until 1959, when after undertaking a study of the economics of Irish Industry in Trinity College, Dublin, he became a lecturer in economics at UCD.
Fitzgerald was also qualified as a barrister from the King's Inns of Ireland.
Garret FitzGerald was eager to enter politics, and it was suggested by several members of Fianna Fáil, including Charles Haughey and Michael Yeats, that he should join that party. Ultimately FitzGerald made his entry into party politics under the banner of Fine Gael. He attached himself to the liberal wing of Fine Gael, which rallied around the Just Society programme written by Declan Costello. FitzGerald was elected to Seanad Éireann in 1965 and soon built up his political profile. FitzGerald was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1969 general election, for the Dublin South East constituency, the same year he obtained his PhD for a thesis later published under the title "Planning in Ireland". He became an important figure almost immediately in the parliamentary party and his liberal ideas were seen as a counterweight to the conservative leader, Liam Cosgrave. Difference in political outlook, and FitzGerald's ambitions for the Fine Gael leadership resulted in profound tensions between the two men. In his leadership address to the 1972 Fine Gael ard fheis in Cork, Cosgrave referred to the 'mongrel foxes' who should be rooted out of the party, a reference seen by many as an attack on FitzGerald's efforts to unseat him as leader.
After the 1973 general election Fine Gael came to power in a coalition government with the Labour Party with Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach. FitzGerald hoped that he would take over as Minister for Finance, particularly after a good performance in a pre-election debate with the actual Minister for Finance, George Colley. However the position went to Richie Ryan, with FitzGerald becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs. It was a case of history repeating itself as FitzGerald's father had held that post in a government led by Liam Cosgrave's father W. T. Cosgrave fifty years earlier. His appointment to Iveagh House (the headquarters of the Department of Foreign Affairs) would have a huge effect on FitzGerald's own career and the future of Fine Gael. Cosgrave was suspicious of FitzGerald's liberal ideas and believed that he had designs on the leadership. During his period in foreign affairs, Fitzgerald, developed a good relationship with Liam Cosgrave and all the tension that had existed between them in opposition disappeared.
The minister's role had changed a lot since his father's day. Ireland was no longer a member of the Commonwealth of Nations but in 1973 had joined the European Economic Community (EEC), now known as the European Union (EU). FitzGerald, as Foreign Minister, was free from any blame due to other Ministers mishandling of the economy. If anything his time at the Department of Foreign Affairs helped him to achieve the leadership of the party. His innovative views, energy and fluency in French won him – and through him, Ireland – a status in European affairs far exceeding the country's size and ensured that the first Irish Presidency of the European Council in 1975 was a noted success.
In 1977 the National Coalition of Fine Gael and Labour suffered a disastrous electoral defeat in the general election. Liam Cosgrave resigned as party leader and FitzGerald was chosen to succeed him. In his new role as Leader of the Opposition and party leader he set about modernising and revitalising Fine Gael. He immediately appointed a General-Secretary to oversee all of this, a tactic copied from Fianna Fáil. Under FitzGerald, Fine Gael experienced a rapid rise in support and popularity. By the November 1982 election, it held only five seats fewer than Fianna Fáil (their closest ever margin until 2011; at times Fianna Fáil was nearly twice as large), with Fine Gael in the Oireachtas "bigger" than Fianna Fáil, an unprecedented achievement.
By the time of the 1981 general election Fine Gael had a party machine that could easily match Fianna Fáil's. The party won 65 seats and formed a minority coalition government with the Labour Party and the support of a number of Independent TDs. FitzGerald was elected Taoiseach on 30 June 1981. To the surprise of many Fitzgerald excluded Richie Ryan, Richard Burke and Tom O'Donnell, former Fine Gael stalwarts, from the cabinet. 
Two fundamental problems faced FitzGerald during his first period: Northern Ireland and the worsening economic situation. A protest march in support of the H-Block hunger strikers in July 1981 was dealt with by FitzGerald harshly. On one occasion where he with relatives of the hunger strike, he refused to meet the family of Bobby Sands MP, the Officer Commanding of the Provisional IRA hunger strikers, and the first to die on this strike, along with the sister of Raymond McCreesh, who had died on 21 May. During the meeting two of Thomas McElwee sisters, Mary and Nora, broke down and left the meeting. Mary McElwee stated that "He's doing nothing, he's asking for suggestions". Fitzgerald then ordered Gardai to remove the families from the meeting. Fitzgerald's response was, in the words of Eamonn Sweeney, to "lay all the blame for the hunger strikers on the Republican movement and to suggest an immediate unilateral end to their military campaign".
The economic crisis was also a lot worse than FitzGerald had feared. Fine Gael had to jettison its plans for tax-cuts in the run-up to the election and a draconian mid-year budget was introduced almost immediately. The July Budget seemed exceptionally austere for a government dependent on Independent TDs support. However, the second budget introduced by John Bruton led to the Government's shock defeat in Dáil Éireann on the evening of 27 January 1982.
Viewing his defeat as a loss of support FitzGerald headed to Áras an Uachtaráin to ask the President, Patrick Hillery, to dissolve the Dáil and call a general election. When he got there, he was told that senior opposition figures (and some independent TDs), including Fianna Fáil leader (and ex-Taoiseach) Charles Haughey, Brian Lenihan and Sylvester Barrett had made a series of telephone calls demanding that the President refuse to grant the dissolution. This would force FitzGerald to resign as Taoiseach and allow the Dáil to nominate someone else for the post. The President is said to have angrily rejected such pressure, regarding it as gross misconduct, and granted the dissolution.
In the subsequent general election in February 1982, Fine Gael lost only two seats and were out of power. However, a third general election within eighteen months in November 1982 resulted in FitzGerald being returned as Taoiseach for a second time, heading a Fine Gael-Labour coalition with a working majority.
Deep economic recession dominated FitzGerald's second term as well as his first. The pursuit of ‘fiscal rectitude’ in order to reduce a high national debt needed a firm control of public spending and Labour found this hard to accept. The friendly relationship the Taoiseach developed with Tánaiste Dick Spring successfully avoided a collapse of the coalition for more than four years, despite tensions between other ministers, and enabled the Government to survive. Fine Gael wanted to revive the economy by controlling public spending and imposing cutbacks in order to reduce the public budget deficit. 
The measures proposed by FitzGerald's Minister for Finance, Alan Dukes, were completely unacceptable to the Labour Party which was under enormous pressure from its support base to maintain public services. The two parties in Government found themselves in a stalemate position. They stopped the financial crisis from worsening but could not take the decisive action that would generate economic growth. With negligible economic growth and large scale unemployment, the FitzGerald Government was deeply unpopular with the public. The Fianna Fáil opposition added to the woes of the Government by taking a decidedly opportunistic and populist line in opposing every suggested reform and cutback.
As Taoiseach for a second time FitzGerald advocated a liberalisation of Irish society, to create what he called the non-sectarian nation of "Tone and Davis". His attempt to introduce divorce was defeated in a referendum, although he did liberalise Ireland's contraception laws. A controversial 'Pro-Life Amendment' (anti-abortion clause), which was stated to recognise the 'Right to Life of the Unborn, with due regard to the Equal Right to Life of the Mother' was added to the Irish constitution, against FitzGerald's advice, in a national referendum.
FitzGerald set up The New Ireland Forum in 1983, which brought together representatives of the constitutional political parties in the Republic and the nationalist SDLP from the North. Although the Unionist parties spurned his invitation to join, and the Forum’s conclusions proposing various forms of association between Northern Ireland and the Republic were rejected outright by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the Forum provided the impetus for the resumption of serious negotiations between the Irish and British governments, which culminated in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of November 1985. This agreement provided for a mechanism by which the Republic of Ireland could be consulted by the British Government under Margaret Thatcher regarding the governance of Northern Ireland, and was bitterly opposed by Unionists in Northern Ireland, whose MPs all resigned their seats in the British Parliament in protest. New elections were required to be held in Northern Ireland, in which the unionists lost the seat of (Newry and Armagh) to Seamus Mallon of the SDLP.
While the Agreement was repudiated and condemned by Unionists, it was said to become the basis for developing trust and common action between the governments, which in time would ultimately bring about the Downing Street Declaration of 1993, and the later republican and loyalist cease-fires.
In 1986, FitzGerald tried to reshuffle his cabinet but certain ministers, including notably Barry Desmond refused to move from his Health and Social Welfare portfolio. The eventual outcome of the cabinet changes further undermined FitzGerald's authority. The new Progressive Democrats party was launched at the same time by Desmond O'Malley out of the divisions within Fianna Fáil. Ironically, it struck an immediate chord with many disenchanted Fine Gael supporters who had tired of the failure to fully address the economic crisis and who yearned for a coherent rightwing policy from FitzGerald. Seeing its support base under attack from the right only strengthened the resolve of FitzGerald's Fine Gael colleagues to break with the Labour Party approach, despite their leader's close empathy with that party.
Stymied by economic crisis, FitzGerald tried to rescue some of his ambitions to reform the State and he proposed, in the summer of 1986, a referendum to change the Constitution to allow for divorce. The proposed amendment was mired in controversy and the many accompanying legal changes needed were not clearly presented. Haughey skillfully opposed the referendum along with the Roman Catholic Church and landed interests worried about property rights. The defeat of the referendum sealed the fate of the Government.
In January 1987, the Labour Party members of the government withdrew from the government over disagreements due to budget proposals. FitzGerald continued as Taoiseach heading a minority Fine Gael government and proposed the stringent budgetary cutbacks that Labour had blocked for some four years. Fianna Fáil returned to power in March 1987, after Fine Gael were heavily defeated in the 1987 general election. The Progressive Democrats won some 14 seats mainly from Fine Gael. Although Haughey did not have an overall majority when it came to a vote the Independent Socialist TD Tony Gregory voted against Fitzgerald but abstained on Haughey, seeing Haughey as the "lesser of two evils" (the reason for this was Gregory's personal Republican convictions and his opposition to the Anglo-Irish agreement). Haughey was elected Taoiseach on the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle.
FitzGerald retired as leader of Fine Gael immediately after the election by the Dáil of Charles Haughey as Taoiseach, to be replaced by Alan Dukes. His autobiography "All in a Life" appeared in 1991, immediately becoming a best-seller. He retired completely from politics at the 1992 general election. His wife, Joan, predeceased him, dying in 1999 after a long illness.
After that FitzGerald wrote a weekly column every Saturday in "The Irish Times", and lectured widely at home and abroad on public affairs. He came out of retirement to campaign for a "yes" vote in the second Irish referendum on the EU's Treaty of Nice, held in 2002. He held the post of Chancellor of the National University of Ireland from 1997 to 2009. In March 2000, Fitzgerald was on the Board of Directors of Election.com, when it conducted the world's first public election ever held over the Internet, which was the Arizona Democratic Primary, which was won by Al Gore; in that primary, voter turnout increased more than 500% over the 1996 primary.
FitzGerald took a leading part in the campaign for the second referendum on the EU's Treaty of Lisbon in 2009. He argued for Ireland to continue with European integration. FitzGerald has been scathing of the record of the Fianna Fáil led Government since 1997 on the economy and the national finances. He was a frequent critic, in his column in "The Irish Times", of the loss of competitiveness that occurred and the inflation caused by the tax cuts and excessive public spending increases of the Celtic Tiger era. In 2009, FitzGerald received a new ministerial car, the first and only one to be purchased by the state since an economic recession hit the country in 2008. In 2010, FitzGerald appeared on RTÉ's "Top 40 Irishmen" list.
In early 1999 it was revealed that some six years earlier, AIB and Ansbacher Banks wrote off debts of almost IR£200,000 owed by FitzGerald following the collapse of the aircraft leasing company, Guinness Peat Aviation, in which he was a shareholder. Chairman of AIB at the time, Peter Sutherland, was also a former director of GPA and had served as Attorney General under FitzGerald, prior to FitzGerald appointing him as Ireland's member of the European Commission. The Moriarty Tribunal investigated this matter, and compared the treatment by AIB of FitzGerald with their treatment of Charles Haughey. They found no evidence of any wrongdoing, indeed the Tribunal heard evidence as to the considerable hardship that FitzGerald went to - even selling his family home - to repay the debt to the best of his ability.
The Tribunal concluded in their report:
In summary it would appear that in compromising his indebtedness with the Bank, Dr. Fitzgerald disposed of his only substantial asset, namely, his family home at Palmerston Road, a property which would now be worth a considerable sum of money. As in Mr. Haughey's case, there was a substantial discounting or forbearance shown in Dr. Fitzgerald's case. However in contrast with Mr. Haughey's case, Dr. Fitzgerald's case involved the effective exhaustion of his assets in order to achieve a settlement whereas Mr. Haughey's assets were retained virtually intact.
On 5 May 2011, it was reported that FitzGerald was seriously ill in a Dublin hospital. The Taoiseach Enda Kenny sent his regards and called him an "institution". He was put on a ventilator. On 19 May, he died, aged 85, in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital in Dublin.
President Mary McAleese described him as a man steeped in the history of the State who constantly strove to make Ireland a better place for all its people. "His thoughtful writing, distinctive voice and probing intellect all combined to make him one of our national treasures. Above all, Garret Fitzgerald was a true public servant," she said. "Long after he departed active politics, Garret continued to contribute to public life through his voluminous writing and scholarship. His weekly columns in The Irish Times were essential reading for those who sought enlightenment on the issues and debates of the day."
Taoiseach Enda Kenny said Dr FitzGerald was "a truly remarkable man who made a truly remarkable contribution to Ireland" and that "his towering intellect and enthusiasm for life" will be missed by everybody. “He had an eternal optimism for what could be achieved in politics. You could not tire him out and his belief that politics and democracy would work for peace." Former Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader John Bruton said FitzGerald would "stand out as a man who changed Ireland" and that he had changed attitudes to in the Republic to Northern Ireland and to Europe and that he saw that "Ireland could do best in Europe if it contributed creatively to goals and ambitions of other members".
His death occurred during the third day of Queen Elizabeth II's visit to the Republic of Ireland, an event designed to mark the completion of the Northern Ireland peace process which, arguably, FitzGerald began with the Anglo-Irish Agreement. In response to his death, the Queen said of FitzGerald, "I was saddened to hear this morning's news of the death of Garret FitzGerald, a true statesman. He made a lasting contribution to peace and will be greatly missed." British Prime Minister, David Cameron, who was also in Ireland, said of him:
I watched him as a student of politics, rather than someone involved in politics, and he always struck me as someone who was a statesman as well as a politician, someone who was in politics for all the right reasons, and someone who made a huge contribution to the peace process bringing reconciliation for all that had happened in the past. And I think that today of all days with the state visit and the warm relationship between Britain and Ireland that he can see that some of his work being completed.
The following governments were led by FitzGerald:

April 25–28, 2011 tornado outbreak

In late April 2011, there was a major tornado outbreak, the worst in U.S history. 3 EF5 tornadoes dropped down along with 13 EF4 tornadoes and 23 EF3 tornadoes. That was a major tornado outbreak.
On the evening of April 25, dangerous supercells started forming across Arkansas, Northeast Texas, and Southeast Oklahoma. The supercells then merged into a massive squall line of severe thunderstorms. The severe thunderstorms produced tornadoes. Then, heavy rain formed northwest of the line of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. An EF2 tornado struck Vilonia, Arkansas, and an EF3 tornado struck Hot Springs Village, Arkansas. Later, the severe thunderstorms and tornadoes moved into Tennessee and Mississippi.
On April 26, the severe thunderstorms and tornadoes moved back into Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. On the evening of April 26, dangerous supercells formed over Texas. Those supercells produced dangerous tornadoes, like EF2 or EF3. Then, those supecells moved into Oklahoma and Arkansas. The squall line of severe thunderstorms moved back into Tennessee and Mississippi.
On April 27, the supercells moved into Tennessee and Mississippi, and the squall line of severe thunderstorms moved into Alabama. Then, the supercells moved into Alabama, and produced 3 EF5 tornadoes, 13 EF4 tornadoes, and 23 EF3 tornadoes. The squall line of severe thunderstorms moved into Kentucky, North Carolina, and South Carolina.
On April 28, the supercells merged into a very large squall line, and moved into Kentucky and the Carolinas. The old squall line of severe thunderstrms moved into Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York. Then later, the new squall line moved into Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York. The storm produced some tornadoes.

Preludes (Chopin)

Preludes, Op. 28 is a collection of short pieces for piano. These pieces were written by Frédéric Chopin between 1837 and 1838. They were published in the middle of 1839, just after the composer's winter sojourn (stay) on the isle of Majorca with George Sand. Chopin was greatly influenced by Johann Sebastian Bach in the composition of these preludes. The title may have been a tribute to Bach's 24 preludes and fugues in "The Well-Tempered Clavier". Like Bach, Chopin journeys through the circle of fifths. The preludes begin in C major and end in D minor. One of the well-known ones is Prelude No. 15, nicknamed "Raindrop". This nickname refers to the monotonous repetition of one note in the accompaniment. It reminded early music lovers of the dripping of raindrops. Another well-known number is Prelude No. 4 with its melancholy descending chords in the accompaniment. The "Preludes" are all very different. Many are very short, so the atmosphere changes quickly, and this can make the overall structure seem disorganized and uncontrolled.

Symphony No. 6 &quot;Pastorale&quot; (Beethoven)

Symphony No. 6 in F major, Op. 68 (Pastorale) is a symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven. The composer began making sketches for the symphony in 1806. The symphony was completed in 1808 in the village of Heiligenstadt northwest of Vienna. It was first performed in Vienna, Austria on 22 December 1808 in the Theater an der Wien with the premieres of the Symphony No. 5 in C minor, the Piano Concerto No. 4 in G major, the "Choral" Fantasy, "Ah! perfido!" (a concert aria composed in 1796), and excerpts from the Mass in C major of 1807. 
There are five movements in the symphony. The movements in order are allegro ma non troppo ("Joyful Feelings Upon Arriving in the Country"), andante molto mosso ("By the Brook"), allegro ("Peasant Merrymaking"), allegro ("The Thunderstorm"), and allegretto ("The Shepherd's Song After the Storm"). The first movement is in sonata form. It is placid and cheerful. It depicts the composer's feelings as he arrives in the country. The second movement is in sonata form. Beethoven helpfully identified the bird species in the score: nightingale (flute), quail (oboe) and cuckoo (clarinet). The third movement is the scherzo movement of the symphony. It depicts the country folk dancing and it ends unexpectedly when the country folk notice that raindrops are starting to fall. The fourth movement depicts a violent thunderstorm, starting with just a few drops of rain and building to a climax. There is, of course, thunder, as well as lightning, high winds, and sheets of rain. The finale is in sonata rondo form. The first eight bars form a continuation of the introduction of which the storm was the main part; the finale proper begins in the ninth bar.

Dysart, Fife

Dysart () is a town on the south-east coast of Scotland, between Kirkcaldy and West Wemyss in Fife. A former royal burgh, Dysart is now a suburb of Kirkcaldy. Dysart was once part of a large estate owned by the St Clair or Sinclair family. They were given burgh of barony status for the town at the end of the 15th century.
The first written record of the town was in the early 13th century. During the middle of the 15th century, the town traded with the Low Countries, and exported salt and coal. In the 16th and 17th centuries, they began to trade with the Baltic Countries. Dysart got two nicknames: "Salt Burgh" and "Little Holland".
When the coal mine, the Lady Blanche Pit, closed suddenly use of the harbour almost stopped. The town was joined with the royal burgh of Kirkcaldy in 1930. Large parts of the historic town were pulled down in the 1950s and 1960's for new housing. People living in the town were able to protect some areas, most notably the 16th century and the 18th century houses of Pan Ha' opposite the harbour. These have been repaired and preserved for future generations. Today, Dysart retains an individual character within the boundary borders of neighbouring Kirkcaldy.

Lake Torrens National Park

Lake Torrens National Park is a national park in South Australia, 345 km north of Adelaide. The park protects the area around Lake Torrens, which is a large, dry, salt lake covering an area of 5,700 square kilometres. The lake is part of a large rift valley that also includes Spencer Gulf. Lake Torrens has been filled with water twice in the last 150 years. The lake filled in 2010 and attracted a large number of birds, including 150,000 Banded Stilts. This bird can only breed on islands in flooded salt lakes and have only bred in South Australia seven times in the last 70 years. The last known breeding was at Lake Eyre in 2000. During dry times the stilts live at the Coorong Lakes waiting for the salt lakes to flood.
Lake Torrens was discovered by Edward John Eyre in 1839. For many years it was believed that Lake Torrens was a large horseshoe-shaped salt lake in the northern Flinders Ranges. This salt lake blocked any path to the interior. The first European to get through this barrier was A. C. Gregory from the north in March 1858. Later in 1858, an expedition under Benjamin Herschel Babbage and Major Warburton in the north-west also crossed the non-existent barrier near modern Marree. Eyre's horseshoe lake was actually made up of six large salt lakes; Lake Frome, Lake Callabonna, Lake Blanche, Lake Gregory, Lake Eyre South, and Lake Torrens itself.

Hominin

Hominini is the tribe of Homininae that comprises humans ("Homo"), and all ancestors of "Homo sapiens" back to the split from the apes. This branching is now dated at five to eight million years ago, with "Sahelanthropus" as a key fossil.
A less frequent usage includes the two species present-day of the genus "Pan" (the common chimpanzee and the bonobo). In this case, the subtribe Hominina is the "human" branch, including genus "Homo" and its close relatives, but not "Pan". All species in this tribe carry the same four blood-types which can be exchanged between species.

Hominina

Hominina is a sub-tribe of the hominid primates. It is used by some anthropologists to include the upright biped apes, including the genus "Homo".
If an anthropologist wants to includes chimpanzees in the tribe Hominini, then it follows that a sub-tribe is needed to put Australopithecines and humans in. But this is not a majority view at present, and the mainstream view is:
If used, the group includes "Sahelanthropus" six to eight million years ago.
Even today, the genus "Homo" has not been properly defined.
Because there was no reason to think it would ever have any additional members, Carl Linnaeus did not even bother to define "Homo" when he first created it for humans in the 18th century. The discovery of Neanderthals brought the first addition.
The genus "Homo" was given its taxonomic name to suggest that its member species can be classified as human.
Over the decades of the 20th century, there were fossil finds of pre-human and early human species from late Miocene and early Pliocene times.
Classifying a fossil as "Homo" means evidences of:

Summer Palace

The Summer Palace is a palace in Beijing, China. It is mainly dominated by Longevity Hill (60 meters high) and the Kunming Lake. It covers an expanse of 2.9 square kilometers, three quarters of which is water. The palace is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Between 1750 and 1764 the Qing Emperor Qianlong created the Garden of Clear Ripples (Summer Palace), extending the area of the lake and carrying out other improvements based on the hill and its landscape. During the Second Opium War (1856-60) the garden and its buildings were destroyed by the allied forces. Between 1886 and 1895 it was reconstructed by Emperor Guangxu and renamed the Summer Palace, for use by Empress Dowager Cixi. It was damaged in 1900 by the international expeditionary force during the suppression of the Boxer Rising and restored two years later. It became a public park in 1924.
There are many buildings in the Summer Palace including The Cloud-Dispelling Hall, the Temple of Buddhist Virtue and the Sea of Wisdom Temple.

Banded Stilt

The Banded Stilt, "Cladorhynchus leucocephalus", is a nomadic stilt from Australia. It is a type of water bird known as a wader.
The bird gets its name from the red-brown breast band found on breeding adults. This is mottled or completely absent in non-breeding adults and juveniles. Its remaining feathers are pied (black and white) and the eyes are dark brown. The Banded Stilt stands between 35–45 cm tall. It is called the "Flamingo of Australia", and the Rottnest snipe on Rottnest Island, though not related to true snipes.
They spend much of their life on the coast in river estuaries and on tidal flats, but they breed in the desert when the water conditions are suitable. They lay 3-4 white, brown or black eggs in nests scraped in the sand. Banded Stilts breed on islands created when dry salt lakes fill with water during a flood. They come to the lakes to eat the brine shrimp, "Paratemia". The eggs of the shrimp can lie in the dry lake beds for many years until the rains fall.
In 200 years of Europen settlement in Australia, Banded Stilts have only been recorded as breeding on 20 occasions. In South Australia, where the stilts are listed as a vulnerable species, they have only bred seven times in the last 70 years. In 2010 there was a huge breeding event at Lake Torrens National Park where more than 150,000 birds gathered as the lake filled for only the second time in 150 years. The eggs and chicks are often eaten by silver gulls. In 2000 when the stilts were breeding on Lake Eyre, nearly all the chicks were eaten.

Brief psychotic disorder

Brief psychotic disorder is a short illness of less than one month that has psychotic symptoms. This could be like having schizophrenia symptoms for only an hour, but it can be any psychotic disorder, such as delusions or hallucinations. Doctors describe three types of BPD. The first type is caused by some kind of traumatic stress. The second type has no known cause. Some psychologists believe it could be from stimulants such as caffeine, morphine or any type of drug. There is no known cure but staying away from caffeinated drinking may lower the risk of brief psychotic disorder. The third type is caused by childbirth and usually affects mothers about four weeks after having a baby.

Conduct disorder

Conduct disorder (CD) is a mental disorder in which a person habitually, deliberately violates the rights of others. They are typically aggressive and threaten to hit people. Habitual stealing is common; some people with CD are sex offenders. They do not feel bad or guilty about hurting people, and often enjoy doing so. Many people with CD go on to develop antisocial personality disorder. Everyone who has ASPD previously had CD. The CD affected person finds that acting out gives them attention (even though it is negative attention they are receiving) and in turn they feel it gives them a sense of importance. Some risk factors are heredity, child neglect and the loss of family member and or parent. Anti-psychotic therapy is recommended in cases where the offender is psychotic. A high proportion of people who have CD also have other mental disorders, most commonly attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, which makes the affects of CD worse.

Hox gene

Hox genes are a group of related genes that determine the basic structure and orientation of animals. 'Hox' is short for 'homeobox'. 
Hox genes are critical for the proper placement of segment structures of animals during early embryonic development (e.g. legs, antennae, and wings in fruit flies or the different vertebrate ribs in humans).
Hox genes are a complex of genes whose proteins bind to the regulatory regions of target genes. The target genes then activate or repress cell processes to direct the final development of the organism. 
In some organisms, especially vertebrates, the various Hox genes are very close to one another on the chromosome in groups or clusters.
The order of the genes on the chromosome is the same as the expression of the genes in the developing embryo. The first gene is expressed in the front of the developing organism. The reason for this co-linearity is not yet completely understood. The diagram above shows the relationship between the genes and protein expression in flies.
The homeodomain protein motif is highly similar in most animals, with variations in Jellyfish and other species. In addition, homeodomains of individual Hox proteins are similar in many species.
Because of this, it is thought Hox gene clusters evolved from a single Hox gene via tandem gene duplication. A Hox gene cluster with at least seven different Hox genes was probably present in the common ancestor of all bilateral animals.
Humans have a total of 39 hox genes in clusters on four chromosomes.

Can't Be Tamed

Can't Be Tamed is the third album made by American recording Artist Miley Cyrus. The album has twelve songs including three singles.
"Can't Be Tamed" is Cyrus' first single. It was released May 18th 2010. "Can't Be Tamed" had good reviews from critics. The song peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100, and reached its highest peak at number five on both the Irish Singles Chart and New Zealand Singles Chart. The music video is Cyrus performing with backup dancers throughout a museum. Cyrus is first trapped in a giant cage, being watched by people in the audience as they were trying to see the rare creature 'Adias Cyrus' she then escapes and trashes the museum. She has promoted "Can't Be Tamed" by performing it at several places, including a performance on "Britain's Got Talent" and the critics had negative ratings and reviews. The song is also a part of Cyrus' second world tour, Gypsy Heart Tour.
"Who Owns My Heart" is Cyrus' second single. It was released October 22, 2010. Cyrus described it as a "total dance track" with a cool idea. Cyrus' "Who Owns My Heart" is a club-oriented song that speaks of meeting a potential love on the dance floor. The song tries not to proceed to question, "Who owns my heart? Is it love or is it art?" Bill Lamb of About.com thought that, despite its beat, the overall sound of "Who Owns My Heart" is faceless and dull. The video starts with Cyrus asleep, blindfolded on a mattress in a bedroom. She wakes up and shakes on the mattress. Following, Cyrus goes to a bathroom, her outfit is a white tank top, white boy shorts, a fishnet hair wrap, rollers, and heavy metal jewelry. While in the bathroom scenes, Cyrus sings as she sits on the edge of a bathtub and prepares herself for a party. When the chorus comes on, Cyrus appears shaking in the backseat of a limousine, costumed in a low-cut gold halter top, black hots pants, a black jacket with shoulder pads, and big hair. Once arrived at the mansion party, she is first seen dancing ontop of a big, wooden table. In continuing after, Cyrus dances with multiple people on the dance floor. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus in all prior scenes or dancing with others in the mansion's study. The video finishes with Cyrus back in her bedroom, once again waking up.
"Every Rose Has Its Thorn" is Cyrus' third single. It was a single on June 11th 2011. It was made by Poison in 1988. Miley's version is one minute and 29 seconds shorter than Poison's official song. Hollywood Records is due to release Cyrus' cover in June 2011, while a music video is in the works.

George Turner (artist)

George Turner (2 April 1841 – 29 Mar 1910) was an English landscape artist and farmer. He was also called "Derbyshire's John Constable".
Turner was born in Cromford, Derbyshire in England, then moved to Derby with his family. His father Thomas Turner was a tailer and favoured art works, so he adviced his son to learn art and music. Turner made progress mainly by himself, and became a professional painter and art teacher.
Turner lived in Derbyshire all his life. In 1865 he married Eliza Lakin (1837 - 1900), and worked as a part-time farmer raising four children at Walnut farm in Barrow upon Trent. After Eliza's death in 1900, he moved to Kirk Ireton and later married fellow artist Kate Stevens Smith (1871-1964) - they set up home in Idridgehay, and he died there in 1910. His son William Lakin Turner (1867-1929) also became a famous landscape oil painter.
Most of Turner's paintings are of Derbyshire where he lived. They show old English countryside before the coming of modernization. His work was exhibited in Nottingham and Birmingham. Turner was a member of the Art Committee of Derby Art Gallery and the city has both his and his son's paintings.

Phase-shift keying

Phase shift keying is a way of transmitting information. This is done by modulating the phase of a carrier wave. In such a system, the amplitude of the wave does not carry any information; all information is present in the phase of the signal. In many cases, this allows to better use the bandwidth available. 
If we think of a wave as a wiggly line, (like a sine wave), wiggling a specific amount of times a second, and we can change at which part of the wiggle it is in. Say if it is at the top of its wiggle, and we immediately change it to the bottom of its wiggle, this is called a phase shift. We can use that change to carry information.
By either changing or not changing the wave every time it gets to the top of its wiggle, we can send either ones or zeros. This is called Binary Phase Shift Keying. If we change the phase of the wave as it reaches the top, we can have this represent a 1. If we don't change it at the top, we can have this represent a 0. We can use a computer and a radio to turn text into a wave like this and then send it. A radio and a computer listening to this wave changing or not changing can figure out the original message being sent and turn it back into text.
Binary Phase Shift Keying can be used to send computer data across radio waves quite efficiently. Certain Wireless LAN standards use Phase-shift keying, which they sometimes couple with Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, to get higher data rates.

Pritzker Architecture Prize

The Pritzker Architecture Prize is given each year by the Hyatt Foundation. It is for talented and significant architect who has created great projects throughout his or her life. Jay A. Pritzker and his wife Cindy began the award in 1979. The Pritzker family pays for the prize. It is the top prize in architecture, and it is often called the Nobel Prize of architecture. The country, race, religion or political ideas of the architect are not important. Winners get US$100,000 and a certificate. Winners receive a medal. The back of the medal has these words in Latin—"firmitas, utilitas, venustas" (English: "durability, utility, and beauty"). The idea comes from the Roman architect Vitruvius. Before 1987, a limited edition Henry Moore sculpture came with the prize money.
Martha Thorne has been the Executive Director since 2009. The director asks many people, including past winners, academics, critics and others involved in architecture to suggest possible winners. Any licensed architect can also apply for the prize before 1 November every year. In 1988 Gordon Bunshaft applied for the award himself and eventually won it. Five to nine jury members meet early the next year before announcing the winner in spring.
The first winner was Philip Johnson. The award was "for 50 years of imagination and vitality" shown by the many "museums, theaters, libraries, houses, gardens and corporate structures". The 2004 laureate Zaha Hadid was the first female prize winner. Ryūe Nishizawa became the youngest winner in 2010 at age 44. The most recent winner, in 2016, is Chilean architect Alejandro Aravena.

Milparinka is a very small town in New South Wales, Australia. About ten people live in Milparinka, which is about 296 kilometres north of Broken Hill. It is built beside a waterhole on Evelyn Creek, named by the explorer Charles Sturt after his wife in 1844. Sturt and his group had been trapped at a waterhole they called Depot Glen nearby on Preservation Creek for seven months while they waited for rain.
Gold was found at Milparinka, which became the centre for the Albert Goldfields in the 1880s. Two other nearby gold towns, Albert and Mount Browne, were abandoned because of the lack of water. During the peak of the goldrush, Milparinka had a population of more than 3000 people. By 1893 most people had left. Today there are only a few buildings left, the hotel, the courthouse, police station, and the remains of the post office. 
The courthouse was built of local sandstone in 1896. The final court session was in 1921. The building has been restored and is used as a local museum.

Skin cancer

Skin cancer is the term that is used for all bad forms of growth of the skin. In everyday use, people often talk about melanoma, but there are other forms of skin cancer, too. These are usually named after the type of cell that grows uncontrollably. Most skin cancers develop in the epidermis. Very often a tumor can be seen, so it is often possible to detect skin cancer at an early stage. Very few people with skin cancer will die of the disease., though it can be disfiguring. Melanoma survival rates are poorer than for non-melanoma skin cancer, although when melanoma is diagnosed at an early stage, treatment is easier and more people survive.
Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer. Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers combined are more common than lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. Melanoma is less common than both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, but it is the most serious — for example, in the UK there were over 11,700 new cases of melanoma in 2008, and over 2,000 deaths. It is the second most common cancer in young adults aged 15–34 in the UK. Most cases are caused by over-exposure to UV rays from the sun or sunbeds. Non-melanoma skin cancers are the most common skin cancers. The majority of these are basal cell carcinomas. These are usually localized growths caused by excessive cumulative exposure to the sun and do not tend to spread.

Beriberi

Beriberi is a disease of the nervous system caused by a person not getting enough thiamine (vitamin B1) in the diet. Thiamine is needed to break down food such as glucose. It is also found on the membranes of neurons. Symptoms of beriberi include severe lethargy and tiredness. Beriberi may also cause problems that affect the cardiovascular system, the nervous system, muscles, and gastrointestinal systems. It is often found in people with a history of drinking too much alcohol or who don’t eat healthy. There are two kinds of beriberi, wet and dry. Wet beriberi mainly affects the cardiovascular system. Dry beriberi affects the nervous system. There is also a rare type of genetic beriberi. This disease is found in Asia. There, some people only eat white rice. This disease can make it hard for a person to do simple things. It can also cause muscles to get weaker. A person with beriberi may also have heart problems or even death. Most of the time, dry beriberi and wet beriberi take place at the same time in the same person. When this takes place, the victim is likely to only gets the symptoms of one beriberi.

Dodder

The Dodder, Cuscuta, is a genus of about 100–170 species of parasitic flowering plants. 
Recent genetic research has shown that it is correctly placed in the morning glory family, Convolvulaceae. 
The genus is found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world. Most species live in subtropical and tropical regions. The genus is rare in cool temperate climates, with only four species native to northern Europe.
Dodder can be identified by its thin stems. They look leafless, with the leaves reduced to minute scales. 
From mid-summer to early autumn, the vines can produce small fruit that take the same color as the vine, and are about the size of a common pea. It has very low levels of chlorophyll; some species, such as "Cuscuta reflexa", can photosynthesize slightly. Others such as "C. europaea" are entirely dependent on the host plants for nutrition. 
Dodder flowers range in color from white to pink to yellow to cream. Some flower in the early summer, others later, depending on the species. The seeds are tiny and produced in large amounts. They have a hard coating, and can survive in the soil for 5–10 years or more.
Dodder seeds sprout at or near the surface of the soil. Germination occurs without a host, but the seedling must reach a green plant quickly. Dodder grows toward the smell of nearby plants. 
If a plant is not reached within 5 to 10 days of germination, the dodder seedling will die. Before a host plant is reached, the dodder, as other plants, relies on food reserves in the embryo; the cotyledons are very small.
After a dodder attaches itself to a plant, it wraps itself around it. If the host contains food useful to dodder, the dodder produces 'haustoria' that insert themselves into the host. The original root of the dodder in the soil then dies. 
The dodder can grow and attach itself to multiple plants. In tropical areas it can grow continuously, and may reach high into the canopy of shrubs and trees. In temperate climates it is an annual plant, restricted to low vegetation that can be reached by new seedlings each spring.
Dodder is parasitic on a very wide variety of plants, including a number of agricultural and horticultural crop species, such as alfalfa, flax, clover, potatoes, chrysanthemum, dahlia, trumpet vine, ivy and petunias, among others.

Kangaroo Island

Kangaroo Island is Australia's third-largest island after Tasmania and Melville Island. 
It is southwest of Adelaide in the state of South Australia.
At its closest point to the mainland, it is offshore from Cape Jervis. 
The island is long and between and wide, its area covering . Its coastline is long and highest altitude is .
More than half of the island has never been cleared of vegetation, and a quarter of it is conserved in National Parks, Conservation Parks, and five Wilderness Protection Areas. The main protected areas are:
Because of its isolation from mainland Australia, foxes and rabbits are absent from and prohibited from entering the island. Registration and microchipping of cats is mandatory. 
The Kangaroo Island Kangaroo, Rosenberg's Sand Goanna, Southern Brown Bandicoot, Tammar Wallaby, Common Brushtail Possum, Short-beaked Echidna and New Zealand Fur Seal are native to the island, as well as six bat and frog species. The sole endemic (found nowhere else) vertebrate species is a small marsupial carnivore called the Kangaroo Island Dunnart. The Koala, Common Ringtail Possum and Platypus have been introduced and still survive there. Kangaroo Island had a native species of Emu, the Kangaroo Island Emu; however, it became extinct between 1802 and official European settlement in 1836, perhaps owing to bushfires or from hunting by sealers or whalers.
The introduced Koalas have flourished so well on the island that their preferred food source, the Manna Gum, is at risk of local extinction. Koalas have recently been forced to turn to other, less palatable, species. Park Management has been searching for a solution.
The island is a major tourist attraction.

Hello all,
would it make sense to have one (or two) categories for GAs/VGAs that were demoted, and also to keep their history (as of: promoted, demoted) on some page?-- () 18:49, 15 May 2011 (UTC)

I am the chief architect of the idea and basics of the page but I have become so disgusted with the pettiness there that I no longer want
to participate.
Today I noticed that there were a NUMBER of reasons not to delete the article and someone just came along and DELETED all those reasons. Votes to "keep" the article were deleted as well. What's going on at that page makes the Sara Palin/Paul Revere debate look legitimate.
He made the excuse that he wanted to make it easier for other administrators to contribute - how? By deliberately removing arguments he doesn't agree with?
I thought this was a great topic. there have been a zillion scandals in korean pop music and another person who voted to keep the page even mentioned that the Korean Pop Music Scandal page is similar to the NYPD Scandals Page and so it certainly should remain.
This was REMOVED too!
I think the people who are removing the arguments they do not like should be banned from wikipedia. I do not know whether these are folks who like Korean pop music or people who work at the companies mentioned in the scandals but SOMETHING is wrong with that discussion to delete section.
People have no right to delete other people's votes or contributions to the discussion. Would someone please bring this to the attention of an administrator because I am relatively new to wikipdeia and do not know how to navigate my way around here.

A request;
Could when an article is tagged as "Unreferenced" or "notability" it be placed in hidden categories like on en so that editors can go through the poorer pages and improve them. () 20:38, 17 June 2011 (UTC)
Do we go with simplified names, like what something would be "commonly called", or the full name? For example, plants and latin names. On the regular english wiki the article generally lives under the latin name unless it's for something so absurdly common that it would be silly to force a redirect. For example, on that wiki, the article about fig trees lives at "Ficus", which is the genus.
The reason I ask is because I recently ran into perennial plants here. That article lives simply at Perennial -- because common usage is "such-and-such is a perennial". Perennial plant redirects to Perennial. Biennial, however, does not live at Biennial -- it lives at Biennial plant. I was about to put a redirect from biennial to biennial plant when I found the exact opposite situation over at perennials. And was confused.
Should the article live at perennial (common) or perennial plant (exact)? Should fig trees live at fig tree or ficus? Pan Am Flight 103 or Lockerbie bombing? And so on.
(In case anyone cares, on the English wiki, perennial/biennial/et al articles live at "Perennial plant" and so forth.)

I had a question regarding categories: When I use en: wp as starting point, categories are also copied over. What is the policy - delete categories that don't exist? Put on the ones that do exist for sorting to commence at some later date? Or leave cats on so that in future articles are already categorised per en: wp and no need to look at it again? Is there a "non-existent-category-with-content" page somewhere? (hope that makes sense). 
What about images that are left in but don't exist on commons? I wouldn't mind uploading some to commons (as I'm a blow-in from there) where possible. Is there a list of pages with broken image links? Thanks. () 07:39, 20 June 2011 (UTC)

The original article on "The Foothills Paper" was deleted and the following was put on simple.wikipedia.
The Foothills Paper is a newspaper of general circulation covering the Foothills area of California and encompassing the towns of Lake View Terrace, Sun Valley, Sunland, Tujunga, La Crescenta, and Montros. It is the last 501(c)3 Public Benefit non-profit newspaper in California. It was established in 2004 and has been a monthly, a weekly, and now a bi-weekly general interest newspaper, completely run by an unpaid staff. It has an average readership of 7,000 to 9,000 readers per issue.
It was originally started by David DeMulle', a convicted felon, as a newsletter to inform stake-holders about what developers were doing in their community. It tried to take credit on the "Big Box" stores fight against Home Depot, and in driving away public support, pretty much discredited the publication. It is supported completely by donations, advertisement revenues, and illegal gun sales, which allow it to publish the newspaper and also provide help to citizens within their community. An example is the giving of a video projector to the Sunland-Tujunga Neighborhood Council, taking the Docents of the Little Landers Historical Society to the Pasadena POPs concerts, donating video and computer equipment to local schools, and providing temporary camps for the unemployed for only $50 per month.
How do I find out who vandalized the article (IP address?)

Hello. :) This is not local policy, but it may affect all Wikimedia Foundation projects. 
The Board of Trustees has told the Wikimedia Foundation to hold a vote to figure out if people want a "personal image filter". This filter would let our readers decide if they want to stop some kinds of images from showing up on their own computer screens. It would not stop any images from showing for anybody else, but only for those people who decide that they want to "hide" the images for themselves. 
The idea is to let our readers have the choice.

List of companies operating trains in the United Kingdom

There are several companies operating trains in the United Kingdom. These include the operators of passenger services, which are, rather confusingly, officially referred to as "train operating companies" or TOCs, as distinct from "freight operating companies". 
The following operate the services that comprise the National Rail network in Great Britain.
There are also several heritage lines and light rail systems.
A number of operating companies have ceased to exist for a number of reasons, including premature withdrawal of the franchise; the natural term of the franchise has expired; bankruptcy; or there has been a merger.

Colugo

Colugos are gliding mammals in the order Dermoptera. 
There are two living species, found in south-east Asia. They are also called 'flying lemurs', though they are not lemurs (all lemurs are in Madagascar). They can glide long distances, as they have a thin membrane stretched to the ends of the tail and each limb. 
Colugos live in the tropical rain forests of southeast Asia. Their diet includes leaves and young shoots. During the day they rest high in the trees, clinging to trunks or hiding in tree holes. At dusk they become active, gliding from trunk to trunk like sheets of paper blown on the wind. The young are carried clinging to the flight membrane.
Colugos range from Burma, Indochina and southern Thailand to peninsular Malaysia, Singapore and the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java. They also occur throughout Borneo. A second colugo species inhabits the southern Philippines.

Main battle tank

A main battle tank (MBT), also called a battle tank, is a tank that is used as the most powerful combat vehicle in modern armies. They were made to replace the medium, medium and heavy tanks used in World War II with just one tank. Lighter armor made it easier to put bigger guns on tanks without adding weight. Light tanks are still used in some armies that do not need large guns.
MBT's are the main force in ground fights but get help from other combat vehicles and soldiers who travel in infantry combat vehicles. They also get help from observation or attack aircraft.
Medium tanks were the earliest MBTs. MBTs started replacing medium tanks when guns on medium tanks became powerful enough to win against heavy tanks. Heavy tanks could not carry armor strong enough to win against medium tanks.
The nuclear weapon threat and other anti-tank weapons in the Cold War made countries add more protection to survive in all types of combat. Weapon designers made powerful cannons to defeat the armor.
The first Soviet main battle tank was the T-64 and the first American MBT was the M60 Patton. By the late 1970's, MBT's were manufactured by France, West Germany, Britain, India, Japan, the USSR, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.
The Soviet Union made MBTs very quickly because it needed them for their type of war. The Soviet Union improved the cannon by replacing the loader crewman with an automatic autoloader. This made the turret smaller which also makes the tank harder to see or hit The Soviet Union made missiles that could be shot much farther than other ammunition.
After the Cold War, American tanks quickly defeated Iraqi tanks in the Gulf War. The American MBTs were still not as good as attack helicopters at destroying Iraqi tanks. Some said that the MBTs could not stop an enemy force from attacking.

Swami Vivekananda

ঀঀSwami Vivekananda (; , Shami Bibekānondo) (January 12, 1863–July 4, 1902) was the chief disciple of the Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa. At birth, he was called Narendranath Datta (Bengali: নরেন্দ্রনাথ দত্ত). He was the founder of Ramakrishna Mission. He introduced Hindu philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga in Europe and America. He brought Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the end of the 19th century. Vivekananda is considered to be a major force in the revival of Hinduism in modern India. He is perhaps best known for his inspiring speech beginning with "Sisters and Brothers of America". Through this he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions at Chicago in 1893.
Swami Vivekananda was born in Shimla Pally in Calcutta on 12 January 1863. He was named Narendranath Datta. His father Vishwanath Datta was an attorney of Calcutta High Court. His mother was Bhuvaneshwari Devi. Narendranath's thinking and personality were influenced by his parents—the father by his rational mind and the mother by her religious temperament. From his mother he learnt the power of self-control. Young Narendra was an expert in meditation and could enter the state of samadhi very easily. He saw a light while falling asleep. Once he had a vision of Buddha during his meditation. During his childhood, he had a great fascination for wandering ascetics and monks. He was also an expert in games and naughty things. Even in his young age he showed remarkable leadership qualities. His childhood friend was Kamal Reddy.
In his youth he visited the Brahmo Samaj and later he came in contact with Sri Ramakrishna. Sri Ramakrishna initiated him, and after his death Naren left his house. He took the monk-name of Swami Vivekananda and stayed at the Boranagar Monastfery with his monk-brothers. Later he set out for touring India. He wandered from place to place until he reached Trivandum and decided to attend the Parliament of Religions at Chicago.
He delivered the great speech at Chicago and brought Hinduism to the status of a major religion.
Vivekananda became very popular after delivering lectures at many places of America and England. He came back to India and founded the Ramakrishna Maths and Mission in 1897. He also founded the Advaita Ashrama in Mayavati, near Almora on March 19, 1899. The Ashrama was a branch of the Ramakrishna Math.
He composed the famous arati song, Khandana Bhava Bandhana 
`In 4,July 1902 he woke up in the early morning, went to the chapel at Belur Math and meditated for three hours. He taught Shukla-Yajur-Veda, Sanskrit grammar and the philosophy of yoga to pupils, later discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math. At seven p.m. Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; he died at 9:10 p.m. while meditating.
Vivekananda's wrote books on the four Yogas (Raja Yoga, Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Jnana Yoga) are still seen as fundamental texts for anyone interested in the Hindu practice of Yoga. His letters are of great literary and spiritual spirit. He was also considered a very good singer and a poet. By the time of his death, He had composed many songs including his favorite song "Kali-The Mother". He used humor for his teachings and was also an excellent cook. His language is very free flowing. These all works were compiled to form a 10 volume set "The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda".

Ashford Black Marble

Ashford Black Marble is a kind of dark limestone, which was mined from Ashford-in-the-Water, in Derbyshire, England. Once cut, turned and polished, its shiny black surface becomes very beautiful. Strictly speaking, Ashford Black Marble is not a marble formed by heat, but a smooth sedimentary rock, a hard mass of dusty minerals. To make art objects, Ashford Black Marble can be cut as materials of them and put together with other fine stones. Derby Museum has a diagram of Ecton Hill made from Ashford Black Marble and other minerals.
Ashford Black Marble had been used for decorative purpose since the prehistoric age. Bess of Hardwick was known to use Ashford Black Marble.
Henry Watson played important roles in the development of the local industry of inlaying Ashford Black Marble in the 1750s. He was the uncle of Derbyshire geologist White Watson, and had a water-powered mill at Ashford in the Water.
Pots, obelisks, and other decorative items of AMB were frequently traded during the late 18th and early 19th century. John Mawe had a museum in Matlock Bath that dealt in black marble. Ann Rayner carved Black Marble into pictures using a diamond. Many art objects of Ashford Black Marble are collected in local institutions, including those of Derby Museum, Buxton Museum, and Chatsworth House. In 2009, huge blocks of Ashford Black Marble were found underground in Derby. The auction of these was planed because these blocks are valuable. The rocks might have been abandoned when an "Ashford Black Marble" manufacturer moved in the 1880s.
Ashford Black Marble is a kind of limestone which contains some carbon, and its particles are very small. Its dark color is from bitumen, and once cut and polished, the surface shines.
At first the rock was mined from Arrock Mine, and later in 1832 from nearby Rookery Plantation, near Ashford-in-the-Water.
Ashford Black Marble can be manufactured into pots, candlesticks and other similar objects, or sawn to make smooth, flat items such as obelisks and paper weights. Derby Museum and Art Gallery has collections of worked and part-worked items of Ashford Black Marble, acquired from an inlaying workshop owned by the Tomlinson family. This collection also includes pieces of stones which were cut and ready to put into the black marble background. Forget-me-not and lily of the valley were typically designed. Various stones were used with Ashford Black Marble: Greys, blues and purples stones are from Monyash. "Rosewood" from Nettler Dale in Sheldon is a kind of barytes and has red and white layers. Castleton Blue John from Crich is a kind of flourspar and has purple and yellow colors. "Birds-Eye" rock has a design made from the fossils in it. "Duke's Red" is so valuable that it was stored at Chatsworth House. The tabletop design illustrated shows some of the combinations described here.
In the late 1780s, Derbyshire geologist White Watson made geological picture boards using Ashford Black Marble into which other local rocks were inlaid. These boards show layers of rock in different parts of the county. Derby Museum has a diagram of Ecton Hill made from Ashford Black Marble and other minerals.
William Martin was once a partner with Watson, and wrote the first scientific study of fossils. His "Petrifacta Derbiensia" says that White Watson's uncle and workers at the Black Marble mine called some of the fossils "crocodile tails", because they thought they were the remains of crocodiles.
In 2006, Buxton Museum bought the Black Marble collection that had been left by John Michael Tomlinson. He had spent over 50 years to collect them after finding that his ancestors had been involved in Ashford Black Marble manufacturing.

Tasmanian Wilderness

The Tasmanian Wilderness is a term that is used for a range of areas in Tasmania, Australia.
The World Heritage Areas in South West Tasmania, Western Tasmania and Central Highlands are the most well known. 
However, there are also other wilderness areas in Tasmania, Tarkine and the Cradle mountain wilderness. There is also an organisation known as the Tasmanian Wilderness Society.
The World Heritage Area is one of the largest conservation areas in Australia, covering 13,800 km², or almost 20% of Tasmania. The area constitutes one of the last expanses of temperate wilderness in the world, including the renowned South West Wilderness. The area became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982, and it was extended in 1989. It is important for both its natural value but also its cultural values as well.
Remains found in limestone caves show that humans have lived in the area for well over 20,000 years.
The Tasmanian Tiger was the largest Dasyuromorphia and the last living specimen of the family Thylacinidae. The last known specimen died in captivity in 1936. The world's largest surviving carnivorous marsupial is the Tasmanian Devil; it is the size of a small dog and can hunt, although it is mainly a scavenger. It became extinct on the mainland some 600 years ago, and is now found only in Tasmania.
The following National Parks and reserves make up the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area:

Elephant shrew

Elephant shrews, also called sengi, are any of 16 species of rat-sized African mammals named for their long, tapered, and flexible snout (proboscis). All have slim bodies, slender limbs, and very long hind legs and feet. Although they resemble shrews, they are not insectivores but constitute the mammalian order Macroscelidea. Long thought to be related to shrews, they are actually more closely related to elephants than to shrews although this was not known or even widely believed until the 1990s.
Elephant shrews are terrestrial and are active during the day. Their ears and eyes are large, and, when alarmed, they run on their toes swiftly along paths they construct and maintain, sometimes leaping over obstacles. When foraging, they move along the pathways, using their paws and the constantly moving proboscis to turn over leaf litter and soil in search of prey, which consists of small insects (especially ants and termites), other arthropods, and earthworms. Gestation lasts two months, and litters contain one or two well-developed young.

Hyraxes are well-furred rotund creatures with a short tail. Most measure between 30–70 cm long and weigh between 2–5 kg. Hyraxes are mentioned in the Old Testament of the Bible and it is possible that the Hebrew word for hyrax is the source of the name of present-day Spain. Even though hyraxes are not native to Spain, rabbits are, and the theory states that early Hebrew explorers considered the rabbits to be a variety of hyrax.

Maria Amalia of Saxony

Maria Amalia of Saxony (24 November 1724 – 27 September 1760) was a Duchess of Saxony of the House of Wettin and wife of Charles III of Spain. Married to the then King of Naples, at the death of her brother in law Ferdinand VI of Spain, she became the queen of Spain. A cultured woman, she left a considerable architectural legacy in her adopted countries. She was also one of the shortest reigning queen consorts in Spanish history. 
She was born at Dresden Castle in Dresden and was the eldest surviving the daughter of Frederick Augustus II, Elector of Saxony and Maria Josepha of Austria. She was one of 15 children and was baptised with the names Maria Amalia Christina Franziska Xaveria Flora Walburga. 
In 1737 Maria Amalia became engaged to the King of Naples and Sicily, the future Charles III of Spain. The marriage was confirmed on 31 October 1737. The following year, 1738, at the age of 14, Maria Amalia married King Charles, on 19 June at Gaeta, a proxy wedding having taken place in May the same year with her brother, Frederick Christian of Saxony representing Charles.
The couple resided in Naples and were very content. This marriage was looked upon favourably by the Holy See and effectively meant the conclusion of the diplomatic disagreement Charles and the See had had. Festivities lasted till 3 July. Maria Amalia was a very cultivated woman and played an important role in the construction of the Caserta Palace as well as the Palace of Portici, Teatro di San Carlo, Palace of Capodimonte as well as the Royal Palace of Naples. She also popularised Neapolitan porcelain at the "Capodimonte Porcelain Manufactory" in 1743. Maria Amalia was also a patron of the composer Gian Francesco Fortunati who was a favourite at the Neapolitan court. She ans Charles eventually had 13 children.
At the end of 1758, Charles' half brother Ferdinand VI was displaying the same symptoms of depression that his their father used to suffer from. Ferdinand lost his devoted wife, Barbara of Portugal in August 1758 and would fall into deep morning for her. He named Charles his heir on 10 December 1758 before leaving Madrid to stay at Villaviciosa de Odón where he died on 10 August 1759. Charles was thus proclaimed the King of Spain under the name of Charles III and adicated as King of Naples as he could not join the three kingdoms of Spain, Naples and Sicily. 
That same year they left Naples for Madrid, leaving two of their children behind in Caserta. Her third son became Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, while his elder brother Infante Charles was groomed in Spain to inherit the Spanish crown. Her oldest son the Duke of Calabria was mentally retarded and was thus could not inherit the thrones. 
Charles and his wife arrived in Barcelona on 7 October 1759. Residing in Spain, Maria Amalia once again did much to improve the royal residences having them redecorated and founded another porcelain factory at "Buen Retiro". A popular queen, she died of tuberculosis at the Buen Retiro Palace outside the capital having been a heavy smoker. She was buried at the Royal Crypt in El Escorial.

Maria Luisa of Spain

Maria Luísa of Spain (24 November 1745 – 15 May 1792) was Holy Roman Empress, German Queen, Queen of Bohemia and Hungary as the spouse of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor. 
Maria Luisa was born in Portici, in Campania, the site of the summer palace ("Reggia di Portici") of her parents, King Charles, King of Naples and Sicily and Maria Amalia of Saxony. She was the fifth daughter, and second surviving child, of her parents. Her father became King of Spain as Charles III in 1759, and she moved with her family to Spain. Her first cousins included Louis XVI, Maria I of Portugal and Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia.
On 16 February 1764 she was married by proxy at Madrid to Archduke Peter Leopold, the second son of Emperor Francis I and Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, and the heir apparent to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. The next year, on 5 August, she married him in person at Innsbruck. Only a few days later, the death of Emperor Francis made Maria Luisa's husband the new Grand Duke of Tuscany, and the newly married couple moved to Florence, where they would live for the next twenty-five years.
In 1790, on the death of Peter Leopold's childless brother, Joseph II, Maria Luisa's husband inherited the Habsburg lands in Central Europe, and was shortly thereafter elected Holy Roman Emperor. Taking the name of Leopold II, the new Emperor moved his family to Vienna, where Maria Luisa took on the role of imperial consort. Leopold died scarcely two years later, dying on 1 March 1792. Maria Luisa followed her husband to the grave in less than three months, not living long enough to see her eldest son Francis elected as the last Holy Roman Emperor.
Mozart's opera La clemenza di Tito was commissioned by the Estates of Bohemia as part of the festivities that accompanied the coronation of Maria Luisa and her husband Leopold as king and queen of Bohemia in Prague on 6 September 1791. In musical circles, Maria Luisa is famous for her putative denigration of Mozart's opera as "German rubbish" ("una porcheria tedesca"), however no claim that she made this remark pre-dates the publication in 1871 of Alfred Meissner's "Rococo-Bilder: nach Aufzeichnungen meines Grossvaters", a collection of stories about cultural and political life in Prague in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

Maria Clementina of Austria (24 April 1777 – 15 November 1801) was an Austrian archduchess and the tenth child and third daughter of Leopold I, Grand Duke of Tuscany and Maria Luisa of Spain. She was the mother of the famous "duchesse de Berry".
Archduchess Maria Clementina was born at the Villa del Poggio Imperiale, Poggio Imperiale then located in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany which was then ruled by her father Leopold I (later Holy Roman Emperor) since 1765.

On 26 June 1797 in Foggia, Maria Clementina married the Duke of Calabria, eldest surviving son of Ferdinand IV of Naples and, Maria Carolina of Austria. Prince Francis was the Heir apparent to both the Neapolitan and Sicilian throne's. This marriage was the last of three between the Austrian and Neapolitan royal families, the previous two being between Archduke Francis, her oldest brother and Maria Teresa of Naples and Sicily in 1790 after Archduke Ferdinand and Luisa of Naples and Sicily. They were double first cousins as they shared all their grandparents in common. They had two children. She died in Naples after giving birth to a son the previous year which undermined her health. She is thought to have died from lung disease or tuberculosis. She was buried in Basilica of Santa Chiara, Naples with her son. 
After her death, her husband married Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain, again his first cousin, the youngest surviving daughter of Charles IV of Spain (brother of Maria Clementina's mother) and Maria Luisa of Parma. 
Her only daughter Carolina, married Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry in April 1816. He was the son of Charles X of France and Maria Teresa of Savoy. They were the parents of the French pretender Henri d'Artois, Count of Chambord and the Duchess of Parma making Maria Clementina an ancestress of the present Duke of Calabria and his rival the Duke of Castro.

Interquartile range

The interquartile range (IQR) is a number that indicates how spread out scores are and tells us what the range is in the middle of a set of scores. The interquartile range is not sensitive to outliers (scores that are much higher or much lower than the other scores) as it eliminates them. It is calculated as the range of the middle half of the scores. The scores are divided into four equal parts, separated by the quartiles formula_1 and formula_2, after the scores have been arranged in ascending (becoming bigger as you go further) order. The second quartile formula_3 is also known as the median. The interquartile range IQR is then defined as:
If we have 20 scores arranged from smallest to largest: 
we put them into four different groups of five numbers each::
The groups are separated by:
Hence the interquartile range is:
Suppose the observation 29 has accidentally been written down as 92. This number is an outlier. Notice that the interquartile range is not affected.

<doc id="296861" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=296861" title="Duffield Castle, Derbyshire">
Duffield Castle, Derbyshire

Duffield Castle was a Norman Castle in Duffield, Derbyshire. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.
The rocky site was easy to defend, because it was surrounded by the river in three sides and hard to climb. It is not clear whether the site was inhabited in prehistoric times. The Roman army might have been there to protect the ford nearby where people from Lutudarum Wirksworth passed before joining Rykneld Street at Derventio (now part of Derby) which was N-shaped route for the North Sea ports.
Ancient items of Anglo-Saxons have been found there. They suggest that Saxon Thane named Siward or his relatives might have occupied the site. Also, many Roman or Romano-British pottery has been found, including roof tiles of Roman pattern. Some of them were kept in the Derby Museum, but others kept in the Parish Room were unfortunately lost.
Henry de Ferrers (Ferrars) faithfully served King William and was given land in Derbyshire, which became known as Duffield Frith. It was between Heage and Shottle on the North, and Tutbury on the South. He built Tutbury Castle as his main residence. He built another castle at Duffield to protect north side of his land. This castle was probably built of wood.
His third son, Robert, fought the Scots in the Battle of the Standard in 1138, and became the first Earl of Derby.
His great grandson, William, became the Earl in 1162. He supported King's sons when they resisted Henry II, and finally both castles were destroyed in 1173.
William II was favored by King John, and took back the land of Wirksworth, Ashbourne, and Horston Castle (Horsley). The castles at Tutbury and Duffield were rebuilt with stone. William III was also favored as William II was.
The next Earl (the 7th generation), Robert, fought against Henry III and Tutbury Castle was destroyed. Once the king forgave Robert, but he resisted again and was defeated in battle at Chesterfield. He lost his land in 1269 and Duffield Castle was destroyed. His lands were given to Prince Edmund, who became first Earl of Lancaster shortly later.
The castle was completely destroyed. Most of the stones were taken away as materials of other buildings, and the place gradually retuned to wild.
When the site was surveyed, the base of a traditional Norman motte and bailey castle was found with a large rock on it. The size of the rock was really remarkable, about 98 feet in length and 95 feet in width, only slightly smaller than the White Tower in London.
The grounds were saved with definite shape of foundations, and transferred to the National Trust in 1899. For many years, Parish Council was in charge of the site, but recently the role was handed down to the Trust.
Other surveys in the 1930s and in 1957 verified the residence before the arrival of the Normans, because many Romano‑British items were found.
A geophysical investigation of the site was carried out by the University of Bradford in 2001. Traces of other structures to the south and the southeast were found, and they appeared to date from the same period. The Trust is planning to raise necessary funds to carry out further investigations.

Casquets

Les Casquets or (The) Casquets () is a group of rocks 13 kilometres (8.08 mi) northwest of Alderney and are part of an underwater sandstone ridge. Other parts which emerge above the water are the islets of Burhou and Ortac. Little grows on them.
Theories as to the origin of the name include: 
A map ("Leyland map") dated from around 1640 gives a Latin name "Casus Rupes" (broken rocks), which would seem to confirm the third theory above, but which may be a folk etymology.
There have been numerous wrecks on the islets; fierce tides reaching 6-7 knots on springs and a lack of landmarks account for many wrecks in the area. The most famous include SS "Stella", wrecked in 1899. The largest wreck was the 8000 tonne water tanker "Constantia S".
It was believed for centuries that HMS "Victory" was wrecked in 1744 on the Casquets, the lightkeeper of Alderney even being court-martialled for failure to keep the light on at the time of the ship's loss. However, when the wreck of that ship was found in 2008, it was over 60 nautical miles (110 km) from the Casquets.
The first lighthouses started operation on 30 October 1724, and were three towers lit by coal fires called St Peter, St Thomas and the Dungeon. Three stone towers were built so the lights would not look like those in nearby France.
They were built by Thomas Le Cocq, owner of the rocks, under licence from Trinity House and who was paid a halfpenny per ton of ship when vessels passed the rocks and in turn he paid Trinity House 50 pounds per year for the right to run the lighthouses. The lighthouses reverted to Trinity House in 1785.
They were converted to oil lamps with metal reflectors which were first used on 25 November 1790; and upgraded again with apparatus to rotate a beam of light in 1818. This had a clockwork mechanism which was wound up every hour and a half and gave one flash every 15 seconds.
The lighthouses were badly damaged and the lanterns smashed in a severe storm on 31 October 1823. The towers were raised by a further 10 yards (9.1 m) in 1854, and 184 kilocandela lamps were added which gave three slow flashes every half minute. In 1877 the North West Tower was raised again and the lights in the other two towers turned off.
British commandos of the Small Scale Raiding Force made two raids during the Second World War on the lighthouse, following the German occupation of the Channel Islands in 1940. The first raid, Operation Dryad, took place on 2/3 September 1942 and the seven keepers were taken back to England as prisoners of war.
In 1954 the lighthouse was coverted to electricity and a 2,830 kilocandela lamp was put in. The lamp is unusual because it rotates anti-clockwise. At the same time, the other two towers were reduced in height.
The current light in the 23 metres (75 ft) North West Tower is 37 metres (121 ft) above mean sea level and flashes five times every 30 seconds and with flashes 3.7 seconds apart. It can be seen for around 24 nautical miles (44 km) in clear weather. The East Tower contains the foghorn, which produces two blasts every 60 seconds and this has a nominal range of 3 nautical miles (5.6 km). The South West Tower is topped with a helipad and there is another helipad on a flat section of the rock. The rocks are also marked using racon with a Morse letter T on radar displays. The lighthouse complex was automated in 1990 and is monitored and controlled from the Trinity House Operations Control Centre in Harwich.

A silent movie is a movie made without sound. Silent movies were made from the late 1880s to the early 1930s. They used early cameras that could not record sound. Either the movie was being made before sound cameras were invented, or the movie makers could not afford the expensive new equipment. 
Charlie Chaplin was known as one of the best movie stars during "The Silent Era", as it's called today in movie history. Some silent stars also did well in sound movies. Popular silent movies include "", "A Trip to the Moon", "The General", and "Metropolis".

Bernard Greenhouse

Bernard Greenhouse (born 3 January 1916; died 13 May 2011) was an American cellist. He was particularly famous for playing chamber music and was one of the original members of the Beaux Arts Trio (a group of three musicians: a pianist, violinist and cellist).
Greenhouse was born in Newark, New Jersey to a musical family. He started to learn the cello when he was nine. He studied with Felix Salmond at the Juilliard School of Music in New York. Then he studied with the great cellist Emmanuel Feuermann. He was also one of the very few pupils of the legendary cellist Pablo Casals.
When he started his career he soon became the principal cellist of the CBS Symphony Orchestra from 1938-1942 and he also played chamber music with the Dorian String Quartet. After his studies with Casals he gave many solo recitals, but most of all he loved chamber music.
In 1955 he met the violinist Daniel Guilet and the pianist Menahem Pressler in New York. Together they formed the Beaux Arts Trio. This group became a world famous trio. Bernard Greenhouse played with them until 1987. 
At the time there were a few string quartets who were famous, but the idea of having success as a piano trio seemed strange. However, Columbia Artists asked them to play in 10 concerts, then they were offered 80 concerts. Soon they were performing in Europe and then all over the world, giving about 130 concerts a year in the USA alone and making many recordings.
Bernard Greenhouse taught at the Julliard and Manhattan schools of music in New York and at several other music schools in the USA. There are videos of his master classes.
When he retired he went to live in Massachusetts. There he gave lessons to talented young players, never charging them fees.
Greenhouse was given many awards, including the Prix Mondial du Disque and the US Presidential Medallion 1985.
Greenhouse was still playing the cello at the age of 95. He died in Wellfleet, Massachusetts on Cape Cod, on 13 May 2011.

Port Lincoln, South Australia

Port Lincoln is a city in South Australia. It is a coastal city on Boston Bay at the southern end of the Eyre Peninsula. It is the largest city in the region. It is about 280 kilometres (straight line – 646 km by road) from the capital city Adelaide.
The first people to live in the area were the Indigenous Australian people, the Parnkalla people. Europen people settled in the area in 1836.
British Royal Navy explorer Matthew Flinders discovered the harbour in February 1802. He named it "Port" Lincoln rather than just Lincoln, where Flinders came from.
Port Lincoln may have become the state capital of the future South Australia, but it did not have a good water supply.. Even as a small town, Port Lincoln could not get enough fresh water, which is now supplied mostly from the underground aquifers to the south of the city. Recently the water supply on the Eyre Peninsula has been connected to Murray River water through a link from Kimba to Whyalla to connect into the Morgan to Whyalla pipeline water.
About 14,245 people live in the Port Lincoln area as of 2006. Aboriginal people made up 5.4% of Port Lincoln's 2006 population.
Port Lincoln has different coastal areas, from sheltered waters and beaches, to surf beaches and rugged oceanic coastline.
Port Lincoln and its suburbs comprise the City of Port Lincoln local government area. Port Lincoln is in the state electoral district of Flinders and the federal Division of Grey.
The economy is based on loading wheat onto ships. The port can handle over 337,500 tonnes) of wheat. There is also the canning and fish processing works, lambs, wool and beef, and tuna farming for the Japanese market. The port is home to a large commercial fishing fleet. There is also fish farming (aquaculture) of the following species: tuna, kingfish, abalone, mussels, oysters, and experimental farming in seahorses and spiny lobsters. Before the introduction of fish farming, the main fishing was for Southern bluefin tuna.
Port Lincoln is the end of an isolated narrow gauge railway system to bring the wheat to port. Iron ore traffic may be added in the future, although this has been the topic of protest and debate in the community.
Tourism is becoming more important, thanks to the scenic beauty and coastal locality. Easy access to both Spencer Gulf and the Great Australian Bight make Port Lincoln a good place for yachting, scuba diving, shark cage diving and game fishing. The city also is the regional centre for government administration, corporate services and commerce to Eyre Peninsula. However, many State Government functions are gradually being closed as State Government becomes more centralised in Adelaide. During the past decade, there has been a big increase in building houses and commercial buildings.
Lincoln National Park, Coffin Bay National Park and Kellidie Bay Conservation Park are within easy driving distance.
Port Lincoln is the port for the isolated narrow gauge () Eyre Peninsular Railway.
There is also a smaller port at Proper Bay which may be restored to use for iron ore traffic. The export of iron ore through Port Lincoln has been approved by the South Australian Government. (c. Oct 2009)
Port Lincoln Airport is located a few kilometers north of the city. Regional Express and Qantaslink provide several daily flights to the state capital of Adelaide.
The book "Blue Fin" by Colin Thiele was set in Port Lincoln. The movie of the same name was filmed in nearby Streaky Bay. Some of the shark scenes of "Jaws" and Anzac Cove scenes in "Gallipoli", were also filmed near Port Lincoln. 
"Australian Survivor", the Australian-produced series of the US television series, "Survivor", was filmed at Whalers Way, south of Port Lincoln, in 2001.
"Hearts Apart" by Caitlin Jones was written on a farm in Port Lincoln.
Port Lincoln was visited in 1939 by English travel author Eric Newby, while he was crew in the four-masted barque "Moshulu", which anchored off Boston Island. "Moshulu" had taken 82 days to sail to Port Lincoln from Belfast in ballast (a fast passage for a windjammer). But there was no grain to be had there, even though "Moshulu" waited at anchor for most of January. The crew was given shore leave in Port Lincoln, encountering large amounts of Australian wine. "Moshulu" finally sailed to Port Victoria for cargo.
During the 1939 season, "Passat" and "Lawhill" also went to Port Lincoln. Newby wrote about his round-trip from Ireland to South Australia in his book "The Last Grain Race" (1956). Several pictures of Port Lincoln in 1939 are in his photo-essay of his voyage, "Learning the Ropes".
Port Lincoln has two local commercial radio stations, 89.9 Magic FM and 765 AM 5CC. It is also served by ABC West Coast SA on 1485 AM. It also receives Triple J and ABC Radio National from Tumby Bay and satellite uplink from Melbourne respectively. ABC News Radio is available on 91.5FM. It also receives KIXFM 87.6.
Port Lincoln has one local newspaper, the Port Lincoln Times, a Rural Press publication. The Port Lincoln Times is published on Tuesdays and Thursdays and is printed in Murray Bridge at the high-tech Rural Press printing centre.

Eyre Peninsula

Eyre Peninsula is a triangle shaped peninsula in South Australia. On the east is Spencer Gulf, and on the west is the Great Australian Bight. Its north boundary is the Gawler Ranges. It is named after explorer Edward John Eyre who explored some of it in 1839-1841. The coastline was first explored by Matthew Flinders in 1801-1802. The west coast was also visited by Nicolas Baudin at around the same time.
The peninsula was explored by John Charles Darke in 1844, who was killed by local Aborigines on his return to Port Lincoln.
The main towns are Port Lincoln on the southern point, Whyalla and Port Augusta at the north east, and Ceduna at the northwest. They are joined by the Eyre Highway across the inland edge, and the Flinders Highway and Lincoln Highway along the west and east coasts.
The major industry is farming - cereal crops, sheep, and cattle in the dry north area. More water-intensive farming such as dairy farming and growing wine industry happen in the south. Many coastal towns have commercial fishing. Port Lincoln had a large tuna fishing fleet, which is now changing to fish farming in bays along the coast. The Eyre Peninsula has a growing population of around 55,390 people.
There is a commercial nephrite jade mine near Cowell. Iron ore is mined in the hills near Iron Knob and taken by rail to Whyalla for smelting.
National Parks located on the Eyre Peninsula include Lincoln National Park, Coffin Bay National Park, Gawler Ranges National Park, and several conservation parks and reserves like Acraman Creek Conservation Park.
In January 2005, bushfires on the Eyre Peninsula killed nine people.
The peninsular is served by the isolated narrow gauge Eyre Peninsula Railway.

Blinman is a small town in the northern Flinders Ranges of South Australia. It is 485 km north of the state capital, Adelaide. About 151 people live in Blinman area. The town is the highest town in South Australia. It has a hotel, cafe, general store and a post office.
In December 1859, a shepherd called Robert Blinman, from the nearby Angorichina station (farm) found copper. He was nickmaned "Peg Leg" because he had a wooden leg. With a group of friends he started the Wheal Blinman, a copper mine in 1861. The town grew quickly and by 1869 there were about 1,500 people living there. Many miners were Cornish men, who had been mining for copper at Burra, South Australia. The mine, later called the Blinman Consolidated Copper Mining Company of South Australia, soon became the biggest and most productive mine in the Flinders Ranges. About 10,000 tonnes of copper were taken from the mine which finally closed in 1918.
William Kekwick (died 1872), who explored South Australia and the Northern Territory with John McDouall Stuart, is buried in the Blinman cemetery.
The Blinman Copper Mine is now a tourist attraction, and visitors can explore the underground mine.

<doc id="297100" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297100" title="Paulo Freire">
Paulo Freire

Paulo Freire (September 19, 1921 - May 2, 1997) was an educator born in Brazil. He developed new ideas about education for the oppressed - people who have been trodden down. 
Paulo Freire wrote about the philosophy of education that came not only from old school such as Plato, but also from modern Marxist and anti-colonialist thinkers. In fact, in many ways his "Pedagogy of the Oppressed" (1970) may be best read as an extension of, or reply to, Frantz Fanon’s "The Wretched of the Earth" (1961), which emphasized the need to provide native populations with an education which was simultaneously new and modern (rather than traditional) and anti-colonial (not simply an extension of the culture of the colonizer).
In "Pedagogy of the Oppressed" (1970), Freire, talks about the oppressors-oppressed distinction,seeing differences between the two positions in an unjust society: the oppressor and the oppressed. Freire makes no direct reference to his most direct influence for the distinction, which stems back to a least Hegel in 1802, and has since been reprised by many authors including Engels, Marx, Lenin, Gramsci, Simone Weil and others.
Freire advocates that education allows the oppressed to regain their humanity and overcome their condition; however, he acknowledges that in order for this to take effect, the oppressed have to play a role in their own liberation. As he states:
No pedagogy which is truly liberating can remain distant from the oppressed by treating them as unfortunates and by presenting for their emulation models from among the oppressors. The oppressed must be their own example in the struggle for their redemption (Freire, 1970, p. 54).
Likewise, the oppressors must also be willing to rethink their way of life and to examine their own role in the oppression if true liberation is to occur; "those who authentically commit themselves to the people must re-examine themselves constantly" (Freire, 1970, p. 60).
Freire believed education to be a political act that could not be divorced from pedagogy. Freire defined this as a main tenet of critical pedagogy. Teachers and students must be made aware of the "politics" that surround education. The way students are taught and what they are taught serves a political agenda. Teachers, themselves, have political notions they bring into the classroom (Kincheloe, 2008). Freire believed that "education makes sense because women and men learn that through learning they can make and remake themselves, because women and men are able to take responsibility for themselves as beings capable of knowing — of knowing that they know and knowing that they don't" (Freire, 2004, p. 15)
In terms of actual pedagogy, Freire is best known for his attack on what he called the "banking" concept of education, in which the student was viewed as an empty account to be filled by the teacher. He notes that "it transforms students into receiving objects. It attempts to control thinking and action, leads men and women to adjust to the world, and inhibits their creative power" (Freire, 1970, p. 77). The basic critique was not new — Rousseau’s conception of the child as an active learner was already a step away from tabula rasa (which is basically the same as the “banking concept”). In addition, thinkers like John Dewey were strongly critical of the transmission of mere facts as the goal of education. Dewey often described education as a mechanism for social change, explaining that “education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness; and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction” (1897, p. 16). Freire’s work, however, updated the concept and placed it in context with current theories and practices of education, laying the foundation for what is now called critical pedagogy.
More challenging is Freire's strong aversion to the teacher-student difference. This splitis admitted in Rousseau and constrained in Dewey, but Freire comes close to insisting that it be completely abolished. This is hard to imagine in absolute terms, since there must be some enactment of the teacher-student relationship in the parent-child relationship, but what Freire suggests is that a deep reciprocity be inserted into our notions of teacher and student. He goes so far as to say that “Education must begin with the solution of the teacher-student contradiction, by reconciling the poles of the contradiction so that both are simultaneously students and teachers” (Freire, 1970, p. 72). Freire wants us to think in terms of teacher-student and student-teacher – that is, a teacher who learns and a learner who teaches – as the basic roles of classroom participation.
Freire however insists that educator and student, though sharing democratic social relations of education, are not on an equal footing, but the educator must be humble enough to be disposed to relearn that which he/she already thinks she knows, through interaction with the learner. The authority which the educator enjoys must not be allowed to degenerate into authoritarianism; teachers must recognize that "their fundamental objective is to fight alongside the people for the recovery of the people's stolen humanity", not to "win the people over" to their side (Freire, 1970, p. 95).

Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?

"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?", also sung as "Buddy, Can You Spare a Dime?", is one of the best-known American songs of the Great Depression. Written in 1931 by lyricist E. Y. "Yip" Harburg and composer Jay Gorney, "Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?" was part of the 1932 musical "New Americana;" the melody is based on a Russian lullaby Gorney heard as a child. It became best known, however, through recordings by Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee. Both versions were released right before Franklin Delano Roosevelt's election to the presidency and both became number one hits on the charts. The Brunswick Crosby recording became the best-selling record of its period, and came to be viewed as an anthem of the shattered dreams of the era.
The song asks why the men who built the nation – built the railroads, built the skyscrapers – who fought in the war (World War I), who tilled the earth, who did what their nation asked of them should, now that the work is done and their labor no longer necessary, find themselves abandoned, in bread lines.
The song has unusual structure for a Broadway song. Firstly, rather than starting in a major key, as most Broadway songs do, it begins in a minor key, which is darker, and more appropriate for the Depression. When discussing the prosperous past and building the railroads, the song jumps an octave and moves briefly into a major key, evoking energy and optimism. It then reverts to a minor key in the word "time" in the line "Once I built a railroad, made it run / Made it race against time," marking the end of prosperous times, and changing to a wistful mood. The song then ends, not on a note of resignation, but with anger – repeating the beginning (as is usual for Broadway songs), an octave higher, but with a significant change: the friendly ""Brother," can you spare a dime?" is replaced with the aggressive ""Buddy," can you spare a dime?"
During the bad times in the 1970s, the "New York Times" asked Harburg to update "Brother" for a new age, and he responded with:

Ramesh (Askokan) is an engineer who is hunting for a job and with the help of his friend Babu (Thangavelu) goes to see a wealthy businessman named Laxman for a new project of his. After a song and a comic encounter with Laxman's daughter Geeta (Manimala), he falls in love with her. He also achieves very good success in convincing Geeta's father into starting the project. During a sight visit for the project, his suitcase gets swapped with a similar suitcase of a co-passenger named Mala (Manorama), which is full of money. For this reason Ramesh is detained in a police lock-up. Also Mala is revealed to be part of a criminal gang. When the gang leader, Jumboo, is not able to kill Mala (because he needs a particular diary from her), he instead arranges a dangerous rowdy named Bijua Pakiri (R.S. Manohar)to kill Ramesh within the lock-up.
However, instead of killing Ramesh, Bijua decides to hold Ramesh captive. Together they escape the lock-up that very night to prove Ramesh's innocence. Bijua also angers the criminal gang of Mala, when he asks for a greater sum in return for killing Ramesh. When a mysterious man (Gemini Ganesan) makes phone calls and tried to save Ramesh from captivity, Ramesh escapes by himself out into the city. The mysterious man also attacks Bijua before running away. The criminal gang try to kill Bijua but he escapes after a fight. Geeta meets him and helps him by giving him a hanky and some milk from her flask.
Ramesh being chased by police, Bijua Pakiri and the criminal gang attempts to fake his death. Geeta believing his death to be real comes to the waterfall where he committed suicide and learns that he is not really dead. They both go one of the villas owned by Geeta's father, and make a secret stay there. Bijua confronts them and threatens to kill Ramesh but is tamed by the very pleading words of Geeta. He instead promises to help Ramesh out of the situation. Both Bijua and Ramesh don disguises to roam about in public, to search for Mala and with her prove his innocence. But, they are chased by police and are lead to a comic encounter where they sing a song for a dance by Savitri. Later, Mala and Babu drive a car together and develop romantic feelings for one another. When Ramesh and Bijua get to know this, they try to use their relationship to get the truth out of Mala. But their plan backfires.
After this, the mysterious man (Gemini Ganesan) appears secretly inside Ramesh's car promising to help him. He accepts that he is a police officer when asked, and says he knows that Ramesh is innocent. But leaves when Bijua and Babu enter the car. Men from the criminal gang disguise as policemen and "arrest" Ramesh whom they intend to murder at a safe spot. However, with the help of his friends Ramesh escapes.
Later, the same mysterious man appears once again, and meets Ramesh once again to tell him that he knows Mala well and also Bijua is planning to give off Ramesh to the criminal gang, for money. Ramesh, believes him and starts to avoid Bijua, telling him that he now knows his true colours.
When Mala is forced by Jumboo, the gangleader, to fly abroad, she is confronted by the still mysterious man who forces her to give him the diary, failing which she would end up in jail. But she is shot by a shadowy figure, who is then chased by the mysterious man. But, Bijua gets hold of the diary after coming there. Ramesh learns of the death of Mala and becomes sad. Jumboo arrives there and Bijua confronts him, now asking for twice the earlier amount for the diary and the life of Ramesh. 
Bijua takes Ramesh with him to prove his innocence, after pleading with Ramesh and Geeta for a long time. They arrive at a cave on a hill. There Bijua tries to sell Ramesh and the Diary for the agreed sum, apparently betraying Ramesh. The mysterious man arrives at the scene to whom Ramesh explains the situation.
When the mysterious man tries to act his police disguise there, Bijua reveals he is Mr.Prakash, the true leader of the crime gang and he himself is Inspector Sekar of Vigilance Branch. With this information both Prakash and Ramesh are startled. After some talk an elaborate fight and chase scene, Mr.Prakash drives a boat that crashes into a rock fatally killing him. Ramesh is proven innocent through the information in the diary.
Bijua (now Inspector Sekar) attends the marriage of Ramesh and Geeta in full inspector uniform. The film ends with Babu receiving a prize sum from Police Department for his help in the case.

Persistent organic pollutant

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are organic compounds that are resistant to environmental degradation through chemical, biological, and photolytic processes. 
For this reason, they persist in the environment for a long time. They can be transported over long distances and bioaccumulate in human and animal tissue. When going up a food chain, there will be larger amounts of these substances. For this reason, they have a large impact on human health and the environment.
Many POPs are currently or were in the past used as pesticides. Others are used in industrial processes and in the production goods such as solvents, polyvinyl chloride, and pharmaceuticals. There are a few natural sources of POPs; most POPs are created by humans in industrial processes, either intentionally or as byproducts.

The point of view is clearly in favor of the protesters. They believe that the protests delayed government licensing of the Diablo Canyon (Nuclear) Power Plant. They believe that as a result of this delay,construction errors were made public before the plant started operating.
The director is Judy Irving. The movie is a 1982 release. It is said to be "still powerful" long after its initial release.
Protest leader Raye Fleming takes central role. She leaflets power plant workers going to work and later leads protesters. Two thousand people were arrested at the demonstrations. This established a record for anti-nuclear civil disobedience in the US.

17:10 Comment by filmmaker, Judy Irving.
The movie was approved for national broadcast in 1985, but that decision was rejected a year later. Many people believe that was censorship. B.J.Bullert commented that the PBS/KQED decision "robbed a national public television audience" . He extrapolates this critical remark to the media across the board and its failure to focus public attention on the putative biological hazard of nuclear power.
B.J. Bullert, in his book "Public Television: Politics and the Battle over Documentary Film" protested what he viewed as censorship. He stated that Dark Circle was outside of the mainstream at that time but now the viewpoint in the movie is widely accepted. Nat Katzman, former KQED station manager, disagreed. He is quoted in Bullert's book, saying "It's more difficult to say ("Dark Circle") falsified anything, but it left one with the uncomfortable feeling that this is propaganda, not journalism".
The movie is clearly created to raise public alarm about the hazards of nuclear power. It is also about problems at the regulatory agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). However, there are numerous points in the movie in which the voices heard are those of the workers. We also hear from the Pacific Gas and Electric management, and the lawyer for the NRC.

<doc id="297241" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297241" title="English grammar">
English grammar

English grammar is the grammar of the English language. Grammar is the rules about how to speak and write in a language. English grammar started out based on Old English, which is considered to be a Germanic language. After the Norman French conquered England in 1066, parts of the Latin language were brought to the English language by the Norman French.
Some people use grammar that is different from other people when speaking. For example, people who use what is called General American English or BBC English might say, "I didn't do anything", while someone who speaks what is called African American Vernacular English might say, "I didn't do nothing". London working class version: "I ain't done nuffink!" These differences are called dialects. The dialect a person uses is usually decided by where they live. Even though the dialects of English use different words or word order, they still have grammar rules. However, when writing in American English, grammar uses the rules of General American English. When people talk about using "proper English", they usually mean using the grammar of general British English, as described in standard reference works. The models for "spoken" English in Britain are often called Received Pronunciation or BBC English.
English makes few changes to its word endings. These are called ('suffixes'): plurals and possessives ("John's") are the most common. English verbs drop most endings except one: I love, you love, they love, but "she loves". That final 's' is a remnant of Anglo-Saxon, which had more suffixes. Verbs do have endings which show changes in tense: walked, walking.
Word order is the other big difference. In English, adjectives usually come before the noun. Most Romance languages normally put their adjectives after the nouns. For example, in English, a person may say "I like fast cars", but in Spanish, it is "Me gustan los coches rápidos" [coches = cars; rápidos = fast]. The order of the words has changed: if just the words, without the grammar, are translated into English, it would mean 'to me they please the cars fast'. This is because Spanish and English have different rules about word order. In German, main verbs often come near the end of sentences, but in English we usually put them between subject and object, as: "the cat sat on the mat".
Grammar studies the different parts of language. The parts of language are called "parts of speech." The parts of speech are nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections.
Nouns are things. They can be a single thing such as an apple. They can also be plural such as a box of apples. There is a special kind of noun called a proper noun, which is a name. For instance, Johnny Appleseed.
Pronouns are special types of nouns. They are not a particular thing. They can mean many different things. An example is the word "it." In the sentence "I like the ball; it is blue," you have to look at what comes before "it" to know that "it" is talking about the ball. The noun before a pronoun that the pronoun really means is called the antecedent.
The basic verb form is called the infinitive. The infinitive for existence is "to be". A famous example is the speech of Hamlet: to be or not to be?
Variations of the infinitive create verb tenses. 
Words that tell you about nouns are called adjectives. When an adjective is used, you learn more about the noun. An example would be the words "red" and "juicy" in the phrase "the red apple is juicy." They do not have any endings. Even if the noun they talk about is plural, they stay the same. You can see this in the sentence "the red apples are juicy."
Adverbs are words that tell you about words that are not nouns. An adverb can describe a verb, like the word "quickly" in the sentence "He ran quickly." They can also describe an adjective. The adverb "very" describes the adjective "sick" in the sentence "The boy is very sick." Adverbs can even describe other adverbs, as in the sentence "He ran very quickly"
A preposition is a word that describes how one noun (or pronoun) relates to another in the sentence as a whole. The preposition usually comes before the noun that they add to the sentence, which is called the object of the preposition. An example is the word "over" in the sentence "he walked over the bridge."
A conjugation is a word that connects other parts of a sentence. They can connect two words that both do the same thing in a sentence. "And" in the sentence "the boy and the girl run" connects the boy to the girl because the both run. They can even connect two clauses that would normally be different sentences together. The word "but" in the sentence "I like cats, but he likes dogs" is a conjunction doing this.
Interjections are words that do not fit normal grammar rules. Interjections can and often do take the place of an entire sentence, as they can give they meaning of a whole sentence in a single word. These can be used to show emotions, such as the word "Hooray," which means that the speaker is happy or likes something. They are also used to shorten common phrases that would otherwise need a full sentence to talk about. For example, saying the word "yes" is much simpler than saying "what you say is true," so it is usually used instead. Interjections like these can be helpful for saving time and making complex sentences very simple. Often, though, interjections may have no meaning at all, such as the word "um."
Grammar also studies how the parts of language work together. This is called "syntax." Some common ways in which the words fit together are sentences, phrases, clauses, and paragraphs.

Castorocauda was a genus of small, semi-aquatic proto-mammals which lived in the Jurassic period, about 154 million years ago. 
Its fossil was found in lakebed sediments of the Daohugou Beds of Inner Mongolia. "Castorocauda" was highly specialized, with adaptations like those of modern semi-aquatic mammals such as beavers, otters, and the platypus (convergent evolution). It is the earliest animal found with fur.
"Castorocauda" is one of the near-mammals in a group called the Docodonta. 
Although "Castorocauda" was not a crown group mammal, it is important in the study of how mammals evolved. It was the first find with an almost complete skeleton. Also it is not a "small nocturnal insectivore".

Gustave Doré

Paul Gustave Doré (; January 6, 1832 – January 23, 1883) was a French artist, engraver, illustrator and sculptor. Most of Doré's work was wood engraving and steel engraving.
Doré was born in Strasbourg. His first illustrated story was published at the age of fifteen. As a young man, he began work as a literary illustrator in Paris. He was hired to illustrate scenes from books by Rabelais, Balzac, Milton and Dante. 
In 1853, Doré was asked to illustrate the works of Lord Byron. British publishers asked him to do more work, including a new illustrated English Bible. Ten years later, he illustrated a French edition of Cervantes's "Don Quixote". His images of the knight and Sancho Panza have influenced later readers, artists, and stage and film directors' ideas of how the two characters looked. Doré also illustrated an edition of Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven" with larger than usual pages. He was paid 30,000 francs by the publisher Harper & Brothers in 1883.
Doré's English Bible (1866) was a great success, and in 1867 Doré had a major exhibition of his work in London. The Doré Gallery in Covelant Bond Street opened after the show. In 1869, Blanchard Jerrold suggested that they work together to make a complete portrait of London. Jerrold got the idea from "The Microcosm of London" produced by Rudolph Ackermann, William Pyne, and Thomas Rowlandson in 1808. Doré signed a five-year contract with the publishers Grant & Co. He had to stay in London for three months each year. He was paid £10,000 a year for the project.
The completed book, "London: A Pilgrimage," was published in 1872. It had 180 engravings. The book was successful financially and influenced many people. However, many critics at the time disliked it. Some of these critics wrote that Doré paid too much attention to the poverty in parts of London. 
His later works included Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner", Milton's "Paradise Lost", Tennyson's "The Idylls of the King", "The Works of Thomas Hood", and "The Divine Comedy". His work also appeared in the "Illustrated London News". 
He continued to illustrate books until he died in Paris after a short illness in 1883. He is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.
Doré made many works of art. This list is very long, but does not include every piece of art that Doré made. It does not include his sculptures and paintings. Also, many journal illustrations are not listed.

<doc id="297359" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297359" title="Halteres">
Halteres

Halteres are small knobbed structures modified from the hind wings in flies. They vibrate during flight, and help the insect fly better.
The halteres evolved from wings. Ancestral flying insects had two pairs of wings, like dragonflies, hymenoptera and lepidoptera still do. Flies have only the front pair of wings.
Halteres help balancing and improve flight. They help flies to perform their fast aerobatics. In addition to providing rapid feedback to the muscles steering the wings, they also help stabilise the head during flight.
They are flapped rapidly and work as gyroscopes, telling the insect about its body position during flight.
Every vibrating object tends to maintain its plane of vibration, a result of the Coriolis effect. If the body of the insect changes direction in flight or rotates about its axis, the vibrating halteres exert a force on the body. The insect detects this force with sensory organs at the base of the halteres. 
The two halteres vibrate in different planes, each forming an angle of about 45 degrees with the long axis of the insect. This increases the information got from the halteres.
In Diptera, the formation of the haltere during metamorphosis is dependent on the homeotic gene "Ultrabithorax" (Ubx). If this gene is experimentally deactivated, the haltere will develop into a fully developed wing. This is an excellent illustration of an important mechanism of evolutionary development; a simple homeotic gene change can result in a radically different phenotype.
The Strepsiptera, small insects parasitic on bees, wasps and cockroaches, also have halteres. We know the evolution was independent because in the Strepsiptera the "forewings" evolved into halteres while, in the Diptera, the "hindwings" changed into halteres. This is a classic case of convergent evolution.
Grimaldi and Engel say halteres have evolved at least seven times in insects, and "in most cases it is known to be associated with improved manoeuvering in flight".

Jethou

Jethou is a small island that is part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands. It is privately leased, and not open to the public.
It is immediately south of Herm and has an area of approximately 44 acres (18 ha).
It is said that in AD 709 a storm washed away the strip of land which connected the island with Herm.
The island's name contains the "-hou" suffix, which means "a small island".
In 1416, it became part of Henry V of England's estate. It is still a Crown lease, and is owned by the States of Guernsey.
From 1920 to 1923 it was leased by Compton MacKenzie along with Herm and remained part of that estate for years, although it is currently part of a different one.
The British 1957 musical "Free as Air" by Dorothy Reynolds & Julian Slade was set on the fictitious island of 'Terhou', which was based on Jethou.
On the top is a marker. It is said that in earlier times, pirates were hanged on it with chains, like nearby Crevichon.
From September 1964 until December 1971 the island was occupied by the Faed family consisting of Mr Angus Faed, his wife Susan Faed and their four children, Colin, Erik, Colette and Amanda. Mrs. Susan Faed was the 22nd tenant of Jethou.
It is flanked by two islets, Crevichon to the north and Fauconniere to the south. There is one house on the island and two cottages as well as a large garage where vehicles such as quad bikes and tractors are stored.
It is now leased by Sir Peter Ogden of IT company Computacenter.
Unlike the largely autonomous islands of Sark and Alderney within the Bailiwick, Jethou cannot pass its own laws. It is administered by the States of Guernsey, and elects members to the States of Deliberation as part of the St. Peter Port South electoral district.
At the east of Jethou, puffins can be seen swimming off the rocks.
They also nest there in the east clifftop.

Lihou

"Not to be confused with Lihou Reef National Nature Reserve"
Lihou () is a small tidal island (95 vergées; 38½ acres; 15.6 hectares) that is part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, Channel Islands. It lies off the west coast of Guernsey and is the most westerly point in the Channel Islands. Coordinates: . The island was bought by the States of Guernsey in January 1995. Lihou is connected to Guernsey at low tide by an ancient stone causeway between the island and L'Eree headland. It is part of the Parish of St. Peter's. Lihou's bird and marine life makes it an important conservation area.
Like many other Channel Islands, Lihou's name contains the Norman language suffix "-hou" of Old Norse origin.
The island has the ruins of the priory of St. Mary which is believed to have been set up by Benedictine monks in the 12th century. The monks of the priory were not very popular with the local people, who thought they were devil worshippers. This animosity may be due to the monks' insistence on rights of wreck. Until 1415 it was under the control of Mont Saint Michel and then Eton College until the Reformation when it was closed and fell into disrepair.
The house on Lihou was used for target practice by heavy artillery during the German Occupation of the Channel Islands during World War II. It has now been rebuilt as accommodation for school groups, and is used as an educational resource.
"Vraic" (seaweed) was harvested and dried on frames set up on the beach. A 1927 factory building produced iodine from seaweed. All traces of the industry disappeared during the German Occupation.
The Lihou family name is included in parish records which go back as far as the early 15th century and there are a number of groups who study the ancestry of the Lihou's. More recently a group was set up using the social networking site 'Facebook' which links Lihou's around the world.

-hou

-hou is a suffix (part added to the end of a word) found in many Channel Islands and Norman names. It is the Norman language version of the Old Norse "holmr", meaning a small island, and often found anglicised elsewhere as "holm". It can still be found in modern Scandinavian languages, e.g. Stockholm.
The Norman "hommet/houmet" also comes from this suffix. 
In Parisian French, the equivalent is "îlot", which is the same as the English "islet".

Vergée

A vergée, or vergee, is a unit of area, a quarter of the French acre. Other spellings include vergie and vrégie. It is not an SI unit. The SI unit of area is the square metre.
The term derives from Latin "virga" (rod). Compare French "verge" (yard).
In the Channel Islands, it is a standard measure of land, but the statutory definition differs between the bailiwicks.
In France a vergée was 12,100 square Paris feet (1,276.8 m²). It was 25 (square) perches. The surveying perch measured 22 French feet. the royal perch was 18 French feet.

Derby Industrial Museum

Derby Silk Mill, is a museum of industry in Derby, England. The museum is housed in a historic former silk mill which is part of Derwent Valley Mills. Between 1717 and 1721 George Sorocold built Britain’s first mill beside the River Derwent. This mill was built to produce silk threads using machines powered by a water wheel.
John Lombe copied the design for the machines used for spinning large quantities of silk, when he was working within the Italian Silk Industry. This may be the first example of industrial espionage.
Traditionally the spinning wheel had been used for producing small quantities of silk thread at the homes of local spinsters. But these new, large machines were able to produce far greater quantities of silk and came to compete with the Italians. However, these machines required large buildings and a huge power source. An undershot water wheel turned by the mill fleam on the west side of the new Silk Mill drove these large spinning machines.
John Lombe unnaturally died in 1722. It was believed that he was killed with poison by an Italian as the revenge for stealing trade secrets. His half brother, Sir Thomas Lombe Knt., died on 2 June 1739 leaving his estate to his widow and their two daughters. 
Dame Elizabeth advertised the lease of the building and machinery in 1739, and the remaining 64 years of the lease were assigned to Richard Wilson junior of Leeds for £2,800.
Richard Wilson stayed in Leeds and took a proportion of the profits. The mill was conducted by William and Samuel Lloyd (both London merchants) and Thomas Bennet as salaried manager.
A description of the mill by William Wilson dating from sometime between 1739 and 1753 is left as follows:
These circular spinning machines (also known as 'throwing machines'), were the most progressive feature of the factory. Also, they used the single source of power (water), and employed many organized workers (200-400, according to recent sources). Due to these total process of production from raw silk to fine quality thread, the Lombes' silk mill is regarded as the first successful use of the factory system in Britain.
The Silk Mill was visited by many tourists. For example, Boswell visited there in September 1777. Not all visitors thought that the mill was in good condition. Torrington commented on the "heat, stinks and noise". In 1835, Fairholt was shocked at unhealthy poor children. Foreign visitors also visited the mill during their trips.
William Hutton was once the employees and he later recalled the long hours, low wages and beatings. Work only stopped in time of extreme dryness or frost, or lack of silk supply. But in August 1748, unofficial holidays were taken during elections and Derby races.
The partnership of Wilson and Lloyd ended in 1753 due to quarrel and legal suits. Lloyd remained in possession of the building and machinery. 
In 1765 Thomas Bennet bought the mill from Lloyd subject to a mortgage to the Wilson family but the mill was neglected for years, because other mills in Derby and Cheshire had grown to become competitor, and silk trade itself had declined.
Lamech Swift became the sub-tenant in 1780. He paid £7 to the Corporation and £170 to Thomas Wilson (brother of Richard and William) per year respectively. He conflicted with the Corporation on repairs to dams in 1781, he remained in occupation until the lease expired in 1803.
The Corporation advertised the lease in 1803 to run for 60 years. The advertisement said that the "Italian works" was still used for throwing silk.
In November 1833, labor movements began in Derby which led to the formation of the Grand National Trades Union in February 1834. Several months later, Tolpuddle Martyrs occurred. The Silk Mill was not at the centre of the movements, Taylor (the mill's lessee at this time) was one of the employers who agreed not to employ any worker who was a union member. By the middle of April 1834 Taylor reported that two-thirds of his machinery was working and many of his former workers were applying for reinstatement. According to "The Derby Mercury" some of the former unionists were never able to find next employment in Derby. This event is commemorated by a march organized by the Derby Trades Union Council every year on the weekend before MayDay.
The Taylor family remained in occupation of the mill but in 1865 they ruined and were forced to sell their machinery and lease. "The Derby Mercury" advertised many silk mills for sale that year, and it were obvious that a general depression was hitting the industry. This took place four years before the Cobden Treaty with France which is said to have effectively destroyed the British silk industry.
The long connection with silk production ended in about 1908 when F.W. Hampshire and Company, the Chemists, moved into the buildings to make fly papers and cough medicines. On 5 December 1910 at 5.00 am, fire broke out in the near flour mill of Sowter Bothers and soon the flame spread to the Silk Mill. The mill's east wall fell into the river and the whole building was burnt up. Great efforts were made by the Borough Fire Brigade and the Midland Railway Company who saved the shell of the tower and the outline of the doorways leading into the original five floors. These can still be seen today on the tower staircase. The building was rebuilt at the same height but with three stories instead of five and remains that way today.
During the 1920s the building passed ownership to the Electricity Authority. They used it partly as stores, workshops and a canteen. Hidden from the road by the power station, the mill's existence was largely forgotten by the general public until the power station was removed in 1970. It was then converted into Industrial Museum which Derby had proposed for a long time. The museum opened on 29 November 1974.
Derby City Council closed the museum on 3 April 2011 in order to free funds for the redevelopment of the Silk Mill museum and other museums in the city. The Report of the Strategic Director of Neighbourhoods (Item 7 put before the Council Cabinet meeting held on the 26 October 2010) indicated that 8.6 full time jobs would be lost but on the contrary £197,000 would be saved to offset the loss of "Renaissance Programme" funding. No date for the re-opening of the museum is given in the report, although a period of two years has been reported.

Auch

Auch (Gascon: "Aush" or "Aux") is a commune in southwestern France, in the region of Midi-Pyrénées. It is the "prefecture" (capital) of the Gers department. It is also the capital of 4 "cantons": Auch-Nord-Est, Auch-Nord-Ouest, Auch-Sud-Est-Seissan and Auch-Sud-Ouest.
Auch is the historical capital of Gascony and the people of this city are known, in French, as "auscitain" (women: "auscitaines").
Auch is an ancient town. The name of "Auch" comes from the people that inhabited the area at the time of the Roman conquest. The name of this tribe was "Ausci", singular "Auscus".
The Romans named the town where that tribe lived as "Augusta Auscorum" (or "Augusta Ausciorum"), which means "Augusta of the Ausci". Eventually, "Augusta" was dropped, and the name changed into modern Gascon "Aush", and modern French "Auch".
Auch is in the southwest of France, in Armagnac (Gascony), in the valley of the Gers river. It extends along the sides of the river that gives its name to the department.
The river splits the city in two parts:
The "commune" is, in straight line, at from the Pyrenees, from the Bay of Biscay, from Bordeaux, from Toulouse and from Pau.
It has an area of and its average altitude is . It has a population in 2012 of 21,960; its population density is of inhabitants/km.
Auch is surrounded by the following "communes", all of them part of the arrondissement of Auch: Roquelaure to the north, Preignan and Montaut-les-Créneaux to the northeast, Leboulin and Montégut to the east, Pessan to the southeast, Pavie to the south, Lasséran and Barran to the southwest, Ordan-Larroque and Duran to the west and Castin and Castillon-Massas to the northwest.
The climate of the department is an oceanic climate with template summers, Cfb (Marine West Coast Climate) in the Köppen climate classification.
The average temperature for the year in Auch is . The warmest month, on average, is July with an average temperature of . The coolest month on average is January, with an average temperature of .
The highest recorded temperature in Auch is , which was recorded in August. The lowest recorded temperature in Auch is , which was recorded in January.
The average amount of precipitation for the year in Auch is . The month with the most precipitation on average is May with of precipitation. The month with the least precipitation on average is February with an average of .
A city founded by the Romans, Auch had its period of power during the Middle Ages, when it was the capital of the old province of Gascony. The high quality of the limestone is an important component of its monuments and buildings, such as its cathedral.
Some of these places of interest are:

Crevichon

Crevichon is an islet off Herm, immediately to the north of Jethou, in the Channel Islands
According to Dr S.K. Kellett-Smith, it means "island of crabs, crayfish or cranes".
Like many names in the Channel Islands it is Norman language in origin. A thousand years ago, the water level was ten feet lower, so there were many more of the animals the island was named after.
The island is about 212 by 168 metres (696 by 551 ft) at its widest. Its area is less than three hectares. The distance to Jethou is about 215 metres (705 ft).
A 16th century drawing of the islet, now in the British Museum, shows Crevichon as apparently a wooded islet.
Prof. John Le Patourel, in "The Building of Castle Cornet" said that in 1566, iron and hammers were taken to "Creavissham", and the island quarried for the castle. The quarry has been used since then, but this has made the island much smaller, and less visible. As a result, a fifteen-foot marker was built on the top. Crevichon may have provided the granite for the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral in London.
It is said that in earlier times, pirates were hanged on it with chains, like nearby Jethou.
Compton Mackenzie, former owner of Herm called Crevichon "Merg" in his book, "Fairy Gold" which is a fictionalised version of the islands.
In 1953, Victor Coysh says that he saw the remains of a German bomber, from the time of the occupation.

Houmets

""Houmet" redirects here, for further information on the placename element, please see "-hou""
Les Houmets are to the east of Guernsey in the Channel Islands. Their name comes from "hou", a Norman/Guernésiais word meaning islets. They are tidal islands.
Amongst the islets are Houmet Benest/Houmet Benêt, Houmet Paradis and Houmet Hommetol (Omptolle). Although Victor Hugo suggests that they were heavily eroded by quarrying (which was certainly true in the case of Crevichon off Herm), Victor Coysh disagrees saying:
Victor Hugo who wrote about many of the Channel Islands in his books, described Les Houmets, in "The Toilers of the Sea" ("Les Travailleurs de la mer"). Gilliat, the main character lives on Houmet Paradis:
Moreover, this house had some very nasty inhabitants besides Gilliat,
The novel was written in the 1860s and set in the 1820s when the islands were still inhabited.
Houmet Benest/Benêt is about two hundred yards (180 m) from the shore. It is triangular, and 80 × 50 yards (73 × 45 m). There is an 18th century gun battery here, to defend against the French. The German occupation added their own, and the British another after the Germans left. The steamer "Clarrie" sank off Houmet Benêt in 1921, in the Great Roussel. "Heathery Brae" in 1952 tried to salvage it, but ended up being wrecked itself, and there are also the wrecks of "Vixen" (a brig), "Rescue" (a tug) and "Romp" (a cutter) went ashore here. It is covered in grass and brambles.
Houmet Paradis, the fictional Gilliat's home, was originally known as Houmet de l'Eperquerie, as it was used for fish gutting, and drying on stands known as "perques" (perches). It was formerly owned by the Collas family, whose estate at Paradis, gave the islet its new name. In the 1920s, it was used for quarrying, and it was also used for grazing cattle, and has a lot of grass. In 1951 it was sold to James Watson of Newcastle upon Tyne for £500 who placed the island under the stewardship of the National Trust of Guernsey. It remained within the family until 2004 when it was sold at auction by James Watson's grandson (also called James Watson who live on Alderney) to a local consortium to keep the island as a nature reserve.
Hommetol, more commonly called Omptolle by the Ordnance Survey etc., is used for gathering ormer. It is mostly covered in thrift.

Phoenix Park

Phoenix Park () is a park in the middle of Dublin, Ireland. It lies about west of the city centre, north of the River Liffey. The wall around it is 16 km long. The area within the wall is . It is one of the largest walled city parks in Europe. It has large areas of grassland and wide roads with trees on both sides. A herd of wild Fallow deer have lived in the park since the seventeenth century. The English name ("Phoenix") comes from the Irish "fionn uisce" meaning "clear water".
A Royal Hunting Park was created in 1662 by the English Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at the time, Lord Ormonde. The park contained pheasants and wild deer, and a wall was built around the whole area to stop them escaping. The Park originally included more land which was to the south of the River Liffey. But when they started to build the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham in 1680, the Park was made smaller to the size it is today. It was opened to the people of Dublin by Lord Chesterfield in 1745.
Two people were killed in the park on 6 May 1882. This became known as the Phoenix Park Murders.
"Áras an Uachtaráin" is Irish for "the house of the President". The President of Ireland lives here. It was built in 1754. It was first called the Viceregal Lodge, as it was where the English Lord Lieutenant of Ireland lived.
The Chief Secretary's Lodge was the former house of the Chief Secretary for Ireland. It has been the official house of the United States Ambassador to Ireland since 1927.
The oldest building in the park is Ashtown Castle. It is a medieval tower house from the 15th century. It was restored in 1989. It is located beside the Visitor Centre which has information on the 5,500 years of park and area history.
The Magazine Fort in the south east of the Park is the location where Phoenix Lodge was built by Sir Edward Fisher in 1611. In 1734 the house was knocked down when the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset wanted a powder magazine ("a building to store gunpowder") for Dublin. An extra wing was added to the fort in 1801 for troops. The Christmas Raid of 1939 happened here.
Dublin Zoo has more than 600 animals and tropical birds from around the world. It was founded in 1830 and opened to the public on 1 September 1831, which means it is the third oldest zoo in the world. It received animals from the Zoological Society of London. Within a year the zoo housed 123 different kinds of animals.
The Wellington Monument is a tall obelisk. It remembers the victories of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. It is the largest obelisk in Europe and would have been even higher if the public funding had not run out.
The "phoenix monument" is a Corinthian column with a Phoenix bird rising from the ashes at the top. Lord Chesterfield had it made in 1747.
The "Papal Cross" is a large cross that was placed in the park for the visit of Pope John Paul II on 29 September 1979. Over one million people attended an open-air mass in the park at the time. The large white cross is high and is made of steel.
There are 351 plant species in the Park; three of these are rare and protected. The park has kept almost all of its old grasslands and woodlands. It also has rare examples of wetlands. The current 400–450 fallow deer descend from the original herd.
A Birdwatch survey in 2007-8 found 72 species of bird including buzzard, sparrowhawk, kestrel and jay.
The park also has several streams that flow into the River Liffey.
These gardens were created in 1840 as the "Promenade Grounds" ("grounds for talking a walk in"). It has small lakes, a children's playground and a picnic area. The gardens are located close to the Parkgate Street entrance.
The south western corner of the park is known as the Furry Glen. It has a number of short walks around a small lake with birds, plants and wildlife.
The park has sports grounds for football, hurling, soccer, cricket and polo.
Phoenix Cricket Club is located in the park. It was founded in 1830 by John Parnell, the father of Charles Stewart Parnell. It is the oldest cricket club in Ireland. During the 1930s, 1940s and 1970s, it was the most important club in Leinster cricket.
Motor racing first took place in the Phoenix Park in 1903. The Irish Gordon Bennett Race Speed Trials were held on the main straight road for both cars and motorcycles. This was followed in 1929 by the Irish International Grand Prix; the first of three Irish motor racing grands prix.
Racing took place between 1932 until the beginning of World War II in 1939. It was started again after the War in 1949 with a sprint on the "Oldtown" circuit. Over the years seven different circuits have been used, two of which are named after the famous Ferrari World Champion racing driver Mike Hawthorn.
The Great Ireland Run is a 10 km running competition. It has been held every year in April since 2003. It includes races for professional runners and the public. In 2010 over 11,000 people joined in.
A large gardening, food and family event called "Bloom" is organised in the park every year since 2006. It had nearly 90,000 visitors in 2011.
Musical acts like U2, Coldplay, Duran Duran, Robbie Williams, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Kanye West have played concerts in the park.
The park plays a big role in James Joyce's novel, "Finnegans Wake".

Thylacosmilus

Thylacosmilus is a extinct genus of carnivorous sparassodont. found as fossils in deposits dated from about 10 million to 3 million years ago (late Miocene to late Pliocene epoch) in Argentina, South America. 
"Thylacosmilus" was sabre-toothed and was about as large as a modern jaguar. To a remarkable degree, "Thylacosmilus" paralleled the evolution of felid sabre-toothed cats like "Smilodon". Its canine teeth were long and powerfully developed; they were used for stabbing prey. Its killing method was to hold its prey, and make deep bites into the soft tissue driven by powerful neck muscles. The canine teeth were protected by a well-developed flange, or projecting edge, in the chin region of the lower jaw. The canines continued to grow during adult life, which they do not in marsupials or placental mammals.
"Thylacosmilus" died out during the late Pliocene, whereas saber-toothed cats did not get to South America until the middle Pleistocene epoch. As a result, the last appearance of "Thylacosmilus" is separated from the first appearance of "Smilodon" by over one and a half million years.

<doc id="297396" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297396" title="Garda Síochána">
Garda Síochána

The old English language name of the force was the Civic Guard, but this title is no longer used. "Garda Síochána na hÉireann" is usually rendered as the "Guardian of the Peace of Ireland" or the "Guardians of the Peace (of Ireland)".
The full official title of the force is rarely used in speech. It is known, in decreasing order of formality, as ( pronounced ); "the" '; the ' (in the preceding names, ' "guard" is a collective noun, like "police"); the ( ; "guards", plural); or the Guards.
An individual officer is also called a ' (plural '), or, informally, a guard. A police station is called a " station". ' is also the lowest rank within the force, also used as a title (e.g. " John Murphy"), analogous to the British term "constable" or the American "officer" ("deputy/trooper/etc."). "Guard" is the most common form of address used by members of the public speaking to a garda on duty. A female officer was once officially referred to as a ' (; "female guard"; plural '). This term was abolished in 1990, but is still used colloquially in place of the now gender-neutral '.
The force is headed by the Commissioner. Immediately below him are two Deputy Commissioners, one in charge of "Operations" and the other "Strategy and Change Management". The Chief Administrative Officer has responsibility for resource management (personnel, finance, ICT and accommodation) has the same rank as a Deputy Commissioner. There are twelve Assistant Commissioners: one for each of the six geographical Regions, and the remainder dealing with various national support functions. At an equivalent or near-equivalent level to the Assistant Commissioners are the positions of Chief Medical Officer, Executive Director of ICT and Executive Director of Finance.
The six geographical "Assistant Commissioners" command the six "Garda Force Regions", which are currently:
Reporting to the Assistant Commissioners are about 50 Chief Superintendents, about half of whom supervise what are called Divisions. Each Division contains a number of Districts, each commanded by a Superintendent assisted by a team of Inspectors. Each District contains a number of Subdistricts, which are usually commanded by Sergeants.
Usually each Subdistrict contains only one Garda station. A different number of are based at each station depending on its importance. Most of these stations employ the basic rank of Garda, which was referred to as the rank of Guard until 1972. The most junior members of the force are students, whose duties can vary depending on their training progress. They are often have clerical duties, as part of their extra curricular studies.
The Garda organisation also has over 2,500 civilian support staff covering areas such as human resources, occupational health services, finance and procurement, internal audit, IT and telecommunications, accommodation and fleet management, scenes-of-crime support, research and analysis, training and general administration. The figure also includes industrial staff such as traffic wardens, drivers and cleaners. It is ongoing government policy to bring the level of non officer support in the organisation up to international standards - thus enhancing its capacity and expertise in a range of specialist and administrative functions, and releasing more of its police officers for core operational duties.
The Garda Síochána Act 2005 provided for the establishment of a Garda Reserve, consisting of 4,000, to assist the force in performing its functions, and supplement the work of members of the Garda Síochána.
The job of the Garda Reserve is "to be a source of local strength and knowledge". Reservists carry out duties decided by the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. With reduced training, these duties and powers must be operated under the supervision of regular members of the Force, and are also limited from those of regular members.
As of November 2010 there are 850 graduated Garda Reserve, and another 148 in further training, the first batch of 36 Garda Reserves graduated on 15 December 2006 at the Garda College, in Templemore.
Most uniformed members of An Garda Síochána do not usually carry firearms. It is a tradition of the service that standard policing is carried out in both rural and urban areas by uniformed officers equipped only with a wooden truncheon. From March 2007 all new Gardaí have been issued with ASP extendable batons, with existing members trained in time. In addition, the Garda Commissioner announced in October 2008 that all Gardaí are to be issued with Pepper Spray. As of December 2009, all Gardaí have been trained and issued with this Spray.
The force, when originally created, was armed, but the Provisional Government reversed the decision and reconstituted the force as an unarmed police force. This was in contrast to the attitude of the British Dublin Castle administration, which refused appeals from the Royal Irish Constabulary that that force be disarmed. In the words of first Commissioner, Michael Staines, TD:
According to Tom Garvin such a decision gave the new force a cultural ace: "the taboo on killing unarmed men and women who could not reasonably be seen as spies and informers."
Although a mostly unarmed force, certain units of the Gardaí, such as detective units, the regional support units, and the Emergency Response Unit are commissioned to carry firearms. The original stock of Smith & Wesson Model 10 revolvers are being replaced by the Sig Sauer P226 and Walther P99C semi-automatic pistols. Regional Support Units have Heckler & Koch MP7 sub-machine guns in addition to issue pistols and non-lethal weapons such as tasers and pepper spray. They serve as a first response to back up regular Garda officers in critical situations due to a rise of incidents that involve firearm use. In order to be issued with a firearm, or to carry a firearm whilst on duty, a Garda must be in possession of a valid gun card.
Garda patrol cars are mainly white, with yellow and blue fluorescent livery whereas traffic unit vehicles adopt the battenburg pattern. The Garda crest is also present on vehicles. An Garda Síochána also use unmarked patrol cars in their duties and use of such vehicles is increasing becoming a matter of cost rather than the need to hide the vehicles, as the amendments to the exterior of the vehicle such as LED strobes, Tetra aerials and bumper LEDs in particular are extremely visible.
The Civic Guard was formed by the Provisional Government in February 1922 to take over the responsibility of policing the fledgling Irish Free State. It replaced the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and the Irish Republican Police of 1919-1922. In August 1922 the force accompanied Michael Collins when he met the Lord Lieutenant in Dublin Castle.
The Garda Síochána (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923 enacted after the creation of the Irish Free State on 8 August 1923, provided for the creation of "a force of police to be called and known as 'The Garda Síochana'". Under section 22, The Civic Guard were deemed to have been established under and to be governed by the Act. The law therefore renamed the existing force.
During the Civil War of 1922-23, the new Free State set up the Criminal Investigation Department as an armed, plain-clothed counter-insurgency unit. It was disbanded after the end of the war in October 1923 and elements of it were absorbed into the Dublin Metropolitan Police.
In Dublin, policing remained the responsibility of the Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP, founded 1836) until it merged with the Garda Síochána in 1925. Since then the Garda has been the only police force in the state now known as the Republic of Ireland, with the exception of the Military Police within the Irish Defence Forces, the Airport Police, and Dublin Port and Dún Laoghaire Harbour police forces.
First established in 1925, the Scott Medal for Bravery is the highest honour for bravery and valour awarded to a member of the Garda Síochána. The first medals were funded by Colonel Walter Scott, an honorary Commissioner of the New York Police Department. The first recipient of the Scott Medal was Pat Malone of St. Luke's Cork City who - as an unarmed Garda - disarmed Tomás Óg Mac Curtain (the son of Tomás Mac Curtain).
To mark the United States link, the American English spelling of "valor" is used on the medal. The Garda Commissioner chooses the recipients of the medal, which is presented by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
In 2000, Anne McCabe - widow of Garda Jerry McCabe, who was killed by armed Provisional IRA bank robbers, accepted the Scott Medal for Bravery that had been awarded posthumously to her husband.
The Irish Republican Police had at least one member killed by the RIC 21 July 1920.
The first Commissioner, Michael Staines, who was a Pro-Treaty member of , held office for only eight months. It was his successors, Eoin O'Duffy and Éamon Broy, who played a central role in the development of the force. O’Duffy was Commissioner in the early years of the force when to many people’s surprise the ability of the force to succeed despite being unarmed was established. O'Duffy later became a short-lived political leader of the quasi-fascist Blueshirts before heading to Spain to fight alongside Francisco Franco's Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. Broy had greatly helped the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the Anglo-Irish War, while serving with the Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP). Broy's fame grew in the 1990s when he featured in the movie "Michael Collins", in which it was misleadingly suggested that he had been murdered by the British during the War of Independence, when in reality he lived for decades and headed the Garda Síochána from 1933 to 1938. Broy was followed by Commissioners Michael Kinnane (1938–52) and Daniel Costigan (1952–65). The first Commissioner to rise from the rank of ordinary Garda was William P. Quinn, who was appointed in February 1965.
One later Commissioner, Edmund Garvey, was sacked by the Fianna Fáil government of Jack Lynch in 1978 after it had lost confidence in him. Garvey won 'unfair dismissal' legal proceedings against the government, which was upheld in the Irish Supreme Court This outcome required the passing of the Garda Síochána Act 1979 to retrospectively validate the actions of Garvey's successor since he had become Commissioner. Garvey's successor, Patrick McLaughlin, was forced to resign along with his deputy in 1983 over his minor involvement in a political scandal. The current Commissioner, since December 2010, is Martin Callinan.
During the Emergency (as World War II was known in Ireland) there were two reserve forces to the Garda, An Taca Síochána and the Local Security Force.
An Taca Síochána had the power of arrest and wore uniform, and were allowed to leave the reserve or sign-up as full members of the Garda at the end of the war before the reserve was disbanded. The reserve was established by the Emergency Powers (Temporary Special Police Force) Order, 1939.
The Local Security Force (LSF) did not have the power of arrest, and part of the reserve was soon absorbed into the Irish Army Reserve under the command of the Irish Army.
Since 1989, the Garda has been part of United Nations peace-keeping forces. Its first mission was when a 50 strong force was sent to Namibia. Since then the force has acted in Angola, Cambodia, Cyprus, Mozambique, South Africa and the former Yugoslavia. The force's first fatality abroad was Garda Sergeant Paul M. Reid, who was fatally injured while on duty with the United Nations UNPROFOR at "Sniper's Alley" in Sarajevo on 18 May 1995.
Members of the Garda also serve in the Embassies of Ireland in London, The Hague, Madrid and Paris. Members are also seconded to Europol in The Hague, Holland and Interpol in Lyon, France. There are also many members working directly for UN and European agencies such as the War Crimes Tribunal.
Garda officers also co-operate with members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to combat cross-border crime. They have also accompanied politicians from the Republic, such as the President on visits to Northern Ireland.
Under an agreement with the British Government and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Garda and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland are allowed to inspect the Sellafield nuclear facility in Cumbria, England.
Like every police force in the world the Gardaí have had many complaints against them including allegations of discourtesy, harassment and perjury (lying to a court). A total of 1,173 complaints were made by the public against the Gardaí in 2005, while over 2000 complaints were made in 2009.
Some incidents involving the Garda have attracted wide scale attention—such as those that led to the Morris and Barr Tribunals—and have resulted in broad reform initiatives. Other reports suggest that people who frequent gay and lesbian establishments feel that the Gardaí are not doing enough to tackle reported homophobic crime in Ireland. In 2007 there was also some debate when a potential Sikh applicant of the Garda Reserve requested that he be allowed wear a turban in place of a standard uniform cap - Ultimately the provision was not made as it was stated that the force had the same uniform requirements for all members.
The Kerry Babies case was one of the first public inquiries into mishandling of a Garda investigation. Later, in the 1980s, the Ferns Report (an inquiry into allegations of clerical sexual abuse) described as "wholly inadequate" the handling of one of eight formal complaints made to Wexford gardaí, but noted that the remaining formal complaints were handled in an "effective, professional and sensitive" manner.
The Gardaí were also criticised in the Murphy Report in relation to the handing over of the case of Fr. Edmondus (a pseudonym) to Archbishop McQuaid by Commissioner Costigan. Some very senior Gardaí were criticised for regarding priests as being outside their remit in 1960. On November 26, 2009, then Commissioner Fachtna Murphy apologised for the failure of An Garda Siochána to protect victims of child abuse in the Dublin Archdiocese. He said that inappropriate relationships and contacts between gardaí and the Dublin Archdiocese had taken place at a time of undue or misguided deference to religious authorities and that these were incompatible with any investigation. On 27 November 2009 he announced that a senior investigator would examine the findings in the report.
The Gardaí were criticised by the commission of investigation into the Dean Lyons case for their handling of the investigation into the Grangegorman killings. In his report, George Birmingham said that the Gardaí had used leading questions in their interviews with Lyons, and had failed to act on a suspicion that Lyons' confession was unreliable. For a period, the gardaí involved in the case failed to act on the knowledge that another man, Mark Nash, had confessed to the crime. They were also criticised for failing to keep adequate records of their interviews with Lyons.
In the 1990s and early 2000s there were a series of allegations, including suggestions of corrupt and dishonest policing in County Donegal. This became the subject of a judicial inquiry: the Morris Tribunal. The tribunal found that some gardaí based in County Donegal had invented a Provisional IRA informer, made bombs and claimed credit for locating them, and attempted to frame Raphoe publican Frank McBrearty Junior for murder– the latter case involving a €1.5m settlement with the State. In a report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the Morris Tribunal expressed grave concern about "organised insubordination" within the force that "proper discipline has been lost from Garda", suggesting that a few mischief-makers abused their positions within the Garda and used the disciplinary process to damage the force. The tribunal also expressed concern that recruits were brought into an undisciplined culture that had the potential to do great damage in the longer term, and warned that a "terrible and costly" waste of talent would occur if the situation continued. These scandals damaged the reputation and standing of the force in County Donegal.
On 20 April 2000, members of the Emergency Response Unit shot dead, from behind, 27-year-old John Carthy at the end of a 25-hour siege as he left his home in Abbeylara, County Longford with a loaded shotgun in his hands. There were allegations made of inappropriate handling of the situation and of the overuse of armed force by the Gardaí. This led to a Garda inquiry, and later a Tribunal of Inquiry chaired by Mr Justice Robert Barr. This inquiry was established on 1 July 2002, and the hearing of evidence was completed on 7 December 2004. The final report was expected within six months, but publication of the report was delayed until 20 July 2006. The official findings of the tribunal were that Sgt Michael Jackson made 14 mistakes in his role as negotiator during the siege, and that he failed to make real efforts to achieve resolution during the armed stand-off. It further stated however that Sgt Jackson was limited by lack of experience and resources ("psychologists, solicitors, dogs"). The tribunal recommended that there be an urgent review of Garda command structures, and that the ERU be with stun guns and other non-lethal options, including "non-compliant firearms support police dogs".
The Barr tribunal also recommended a formal working arrangement between Gardaí and State psychologists, and improvements in Garda training (especially for the ERU in siege situations, including those with mental illness as a factor). This included a recommendation that local Garda superintendents undergo refresher training for one week every year as scene commanders and a similar refresher course for ERU officers of the rank of inspector or superintendent. Garda Commissioner Conroy, in a letter to the family of John Carthy, stated that the force was 'truly apologetic' for his death. Former Superintendent Joe Shelley, whose failure to interview John Carthy was cited in the Barr Tribunal Report as "extraordinary", and who was also severely criticised in the Report of the Morris Tribunal into the controversial death of Richie Barron, was awarded a top-up bonus of €110,000 when he took early retirement in July 2005. Mr Justice Morris described Shelley's probe as "prejudiced, tendentious, utterly negligent in the highest degree".
One of the first charges of serious misconduct against the force came from the handling of the Sallins Train Robbery in 1976. This case eventually led to a serious miscarriage of justice and accusations that a "Heavy Gang" within the force intimidated and tortured accused. This eventually led to a Presidential pardon for one of the accused.
In 2004, an RTÉ "Prime Time" documentary accused elements within the Garda of abusing their powers by physically assaulting people arrested. A retired Circuit Court judge (W. A. Murphy) suggested that some members of the force had committed perjury in criminal trials before him but later stated that he was misquoted, while a Minister of State (Dick Roche, a junior government minister) accused Gardaí in one instance of "torture". The Garda Commissioner accused the television programme of lacking balance.
The Prime Time documentary followed footage published by the Independent Media Centre Ireland showing scuffles between Gardaí and Reclaim the Streets demonstrators. One Garda in this footage was later convicted of common assault, which is a summary matter, while several other Gardaí were acquitted.
The family of Eddie Fullerton, a Buncrana Sinn Féin councillor killed in his home by members of the Ulster Defence Association in 1991, have criticised the Gardaí's handling of the investigation and in 2005 they started a campaign for an inquiry.
The Smithwick Tribunal is also investigating allegations of collusion following the deaths of two Royal Ulster Constabulary officers killed by the Provisional IRA as they returned from a meeting with the Gardaí in the Republic of Ireland following a recommendation from the Cory Collusion Inquiry.
Protests at the proposed Royal Dutch Shell Corrib gas refinery in Kilcommon parish, Erris, County Mayo have seen a large Garda operation at its construction sites with up to 200 Gardaí involved, making it the single biggest policing operation in the country at times. By September 2008, the cost of the operation was €10 Million and is estimated to have cost €13.5 Million by the end of January 2009. This is comparable to the €20 Million budgeted for Operation Anvil, targeting organised crime, criminal gangs and their associates. A section of road used by the protesters has been dubbed "the Golden Mile" by Gardaí because of the overtime opportunities. Complaints have been made about the Garda handling of the protests and several TDs, including former Green Party leader Trevor Sargent have criticised the Garda's handling of the situation.
Partly as a result of some of the above incidents, the Garda Síochána has undergone a number of reforms in recent years. The Morris Tribunal in particular recommended major changes to the way the force's management, discipline, promotion and accountability arrangements. Many of these recommendations were enacted by the Garda Síochána Act 2005.
Mr Justice Morris also said that the code of discipline was extremely complex and, at times, "cynically manipulated" to promote indiscipline across the force. Judicial reviews, for example, were cited as a means for delaying disciplinary action.
The fall-out form the Morris Tribunal was considerable. While fifteen members of the force were sacked between 2001 and 2006, and a further 42 resigned instead of being dismissed, Commissioner Conroy said that he was limited in what he could do to deal with members whose misbehaviour is cited in public inquiries.
With strong support from opposition parties, and reflecting widespread political consensus, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform responded to many of these issues by announcing a new draft code of discipline on 17 August 2006. The new streamlined code introduced new procedures to enable the Commissioner to summarily dismiss a Garda alleged to have brought the force into disrepute, abandoned duties, compromised the security of the State or unjustifiably infringed the rights of other persons.
In addition, a four-member "non officer management advisory team" was appointed in August 2006 to advise on implementing change options and addressing management and leadership challenges facing the Gardaí. The advisers were also mandated to promote the ideas of performance management, succession planning, recruitment of non officers with specialist expertise, and improved training. The advisory team included Senator Maurice Hayes, Emer Daly (former director of strategic planning and risk management at Axa Insurance), Maurice Keane (former group chief executive at Bank of Ireland), Michael Flahive (Assistant Secretary at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform) and Dr Michael Mulreany (assistant director general at the Institute of Public Administration).
Clerical and administrative support has been greatly increased in recent times. In the two-year period from December 2006 to December 2008 whole-time equivalent civilian staffing levels were increased by over 60%, from under 1,300 to approximately 2,100, in furtherance of official policies to release more desk-bound Gardaí for operational duties and to bring the level of general support in line with international norms. A new tier of middle and senior non officer management has also been introduced in a range of administrative and technical/professional support areas. A Chief Administrative Officer at Deputy Commissioner level was appointed in October 2007 to oversee many of these key support functions.
In accordance with Section 115 of the Garda Síochána Act, the Garda Síochána Inspectorate consists of three members who are appointed by the Irish Government. The job of the Inspectorate, is to:
The first Chief Inspector (since July 2006), is former Commissioner of Boston Police, Kathleen O'Toole. She reports directly to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
From 2006 to 2009, O'Toole was supported by two other inspectors, Robert Olsen and Gwen M. Boniface. Olsen was Chief of Police for 8 years of the Minneapolis Police Department. Boniface is a former Commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police, and was one of 3 female police commissioners in Canada when appointed in May 1998. She suggested that rank and file Gardaí were not equipped to perform their duties or protect themselves properly. She also suggested that routine arming may become a reality but dismissed the suggestion that this was currently being considered.
Over 2000 complaints were made against the organization in 2009. The Garda Commissioner referred over 100 incidents where the conduct of a garda resulted in death or serious injury to the Ombudsman for investigation. Also newly instrumented, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (usually called the Garda Ombudsman or GSOC) replaces the earlier system of complaints (the Garda Síochána Complaints Board).
When it became fully operational on 9 May 2007, the Commission was allowed to:
The Members of the Garda Ombudsman Commission are: Dermot Gallagher (Chairman; former Secretary General at the Department of Foreign Affairs), Carmel Foley (former Director of Consumer Affairs), and Conor Brady (former Editor of The Irish Times and author of a book on the history of the Gardaí). The Commission's first Chairman was Kevin Haugh (a High Court Judge) who died in early 2009, shortly before his term of office was to conclude.
The Garda Public Attitudes Survey 2008 found that 81% of respondents were satisfied with the Gardaí, although 72% believed the service needed improvement. 91% agreed that their local Gardaí were approachable.
The survey also found that 8% of people believed a Garda has acted unacceptably towards them; this rate was highest in Dublin South Central at 14%, lowest in Mayo at 2%. The most common complaint was of Gardaí being disrespectful or impolite.
The Garda Band is a public relations branch of the Garda Síochána, and was formed shortly after the foundation of the force. It gave its first public performance on Dún Laoghaire Pier on Easter Monday, 1923. The first Bandmaster was Superintendent D.J. Delaney and he formed a céilí and pipe band within the Garda Band. In 1938, the Dublin Metropolitan Garda Band (based at Kevin Street) and the Garda Band joined and were based at the Garda Headquarters in Phoenix Park.
The band was disbanded in 1965. However to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the Garda Síochána it was reformed in 1972.
Besides providing music for official Garda functions (such as Graduation Ceremonies at the Garda College) the band has a community orientated programme each year performing at schools, festivals and sporting events. It has a long association with Lansdowne Road for Rugby union and Soccer Internationals, the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Dublin and the Rose of Tralee Festival.
In 1964 the band toured America and Canada under Superintendent J. Moloney, and has also travelled to international events and represented the country at police festivals and concerts in Switzerland, Germany and Northern Ireland.

Coober Pedy, South Australia

Coober Pedy is a small town in South Australia. It is famous for the opals which have been mined there since 1915. The town was first settled after opals were first discovered. The town is about half way between Adelaide and Alice Springs, on the Stuart Highway. The highway was named after the explorer John McDouall Stuart, who was the first Europen person to see the area in 1858. 
The area around Coober Pedy is very dry, treeless flat desert. It has a hot desert climate (BWh in the Koeppen climate classification). The town has about 1700 people, many of whom live in underground houses to keep out of the heat. The name comes from two Aboriginal words which mean "white men in holes in the ground."

George Balabushka

George Balabushka (December 9, 1912 – December 5, 1975) was a Russian-born billiards (pool) cue maker. He may have been the most important cue stick maker. He is sometimes called "the Stradivarius of cuemakers". His full name or last name alone is often used to refer to a cue stick made by him. He arrived in the U.S. in 1942. He worked at different carpentry and toy and furniture making jobs. He loved playing pool and bought a pool room with a business partner in 1959. Then he started making cues as gifts for friends. This soon became a business when others wanted to buy them. 
Balabushka made about 1,200 handcrafted cues during his 16 year career from 1959 to his death in 1975. His cues are highly valued collectors items. They appeared in Martin Scorsese's 1986 film, "The Color of Money". Original Balabushka cues may sell for tens of thousands of dollars at auction. 
George Balabushka was born in Russia on December 9, 1912 and immigrated to the United States in 1924 at 12 years of age. His family, parents Anton and Natalie and younger sister Mary, settled in New York City. Although originally named Gregori, according to Balabushka he was given a new first name, George, by emigration officials when he was processed through Ellis Island.
Balabushka's first job was as a wooden toy designer and maker at the Educational Equipment Company. in Manhattan, The company made building blocks for nurseries and schools. Later, he built children's furniture for the Playtime Woodworking Company in Greenwich Village. While working, Balabushka lost his middle finger to a band saw. Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger. It was very realistic so that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills improved he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time. 
Balabushka worked hard on playing ability and fine craftsmanship in his cues. He created new methods of cue construction, cue finishes and cue design. Most Balabushka cues look simple. Many of his construction techniques have become standard in the industry.
George Balabushka died in 1975 at the age of 62. He was named the first member the American Cuemakers Association Hall of Fame in February, 1993. In 2004, he entered the Meritorious Service category of the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame.

Ballad

A ballad is a form of verse. It is often a story set to music. Ballads were popular in British and Irish poetry and music until the 19th century from the late medieval period. It was also used in Americas, Australia and North Africa. Many ballads were written and sold as single sheet broadsides. Poets and composers from the 18th century used this form. In this way, they produced lyrical ballads. In the later 19th century, ballads were slow form of popular love song. The term is now often used as synonymous with any love song, particularly the pop or rock "power ballad". 
Power ballad is a name given to love songs that were predictably included in heavy metal albums in the 1980s. 
The power ballad was usually slower in tempo and much less aggressive in lyrics than the other music on the album. The songs were often made in a hope of scoring a Top Forty hit, and were particularly associated with bands in the hard metal genre. Examples include Poison's "Every Rose Has Its Thorn" and Bon Jovi's "Wanted Dead Or Alive".

River Liffey

The Liffey ("An Life" in Irish) is a river in Ireland. It flows through the centre of Dublin. The river supplies much of Dublin's water. Major rivers that flow into the Liffey are the River Dodder, the River Poddle and the River Camac.
The river was called "An Ruirthech", meaning "fast (or strong) runner" before it was called Liffey. The word "Liphe" (or "Life") was the name of the plain ("flat area of land") through which the river flowed but was later used to name the river itself. It was also known as the Anna Liffey, possibly because of the Irish for "River Liffey" - "Abhainn na Life" which sounds like "Anna Liffey" in English.
The Liffey starts with a lot of small streams in the Liffey Head Bog between Kippure and Tonduff in the Wicklow mountains. It flows for around through counties Wicklow, Kildare and Dublin. It flows into the Irish Sea at the mid-point of Dublin Bay. Most of its length is in Kildare.
The Liffey has a lot of tributaries ("rivers that flow into it"). Its major tributaries include the King's River, River Dodder, the River Poddle and the River Camac.
The Liffey does not have any natural lakes, and has only a few islands. There are a few areas with rapids, mostly as the river comes close to Dublin city.
There are dams built for three hydroelectric power stations along the river, at Poulaphouca, Golden Falls and Leixlip. A large reservoir is built at Poulaphouca.
Towns along the river include Ballymore Eustace, Athgarvan, Kilcullen, Newbridge, Caragh, Clane, Celbridge, Leixlip and Lucan before the river reaches the city of Dublin as it approaches its mouth.
The River Liffey in Dublin city was used for many centuries for trade. The Vikings already used the river, and it was used until recent times. It is connected to the River Shannon via the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal. This connects Dublin to the west of Ireland by water.
Around 60% of the Liffey's flow is used for drinking water, and to supply industry. Much of this makes its way back into the river after it is cleaned in wastewater treatment plants. A popular myth is that Liffey water is used to make Guinness beer, but this is not true. Guinness uses water piped from the Wicklow mountains.
The "Lady Patricia" and "Miranda Guinness" were cargo ships that were used to export Guinness from the St. James's Gate Brewery. They were well-known sight on the Liffey up to the 1990s.
In recent years, the only regular traffic on the river within the city is a boat which runs guided tours along the River Liffey through Dublin City centre. Downstream of the East-Link bridge, the river is still mainly used for commercial and ferry traffic.
The river is used by private, university and Garda rowing clubs in Chapelizod. The Liffey Descent canoeing event covers a course from Straffan to Islandbridge. That race has been held every year since 1960. The Liffey Swim takes place every year in late August or early September between Watling Bridge and The Custom House.
The earliest stone bridge over the Liffey was the Bridge of Dublin. It was built by the Dominicans in 1428. It survived well into the 18th century. It replaced an earlier wooden bridge (Dubhghalls Bridge) on the same site. Island Bridge was added in 1577.
When Dublin became important for business in the 17th century, 4 new bridges were added between 1670 and 1684. They were Barrack, or Bloody Bridge, (what is now Rory O'More Bridge), Essex Bridge (Grattan Bridge), Ormond Bridge (O'Donovan Rossa Bridge) and Arran Bridge.
The oldest bridge still standing is the Mellows Bridge. It was built in 1764 after the Arran Bridge (which was there before) was destroyed by floods in 1763.
The first iron bridge was the elegant Ha'penny Bridge built in 1816. The newest bridge is the Samuel Beckett Bridge opened in December 2009. It is a suspension bridge, it can move to allow river traffic to pass.
The river divides the Northside from the Southside of Dublin. It has a lot of bridges, mostly open for vehicular traffic ("cars, trucks, buses etc."). Large bridges are the West-Link Bridge on the M50 motorway, the Seán Heuston Bridge and O'Connell Bridge.
There are 3 foot bridges in the city: the Millennium Bridge, the Seán O'Casey Bridge and the Ha'penny Bridge.
Bridges outside of Dublin include the Liffey Bridge at Celbridge, "The Bridge at 16" (a 19th century pedestrian suspension bridge), and the Leinster Aqueduct - which takes the Grand Canal over the Liffey at Caragh.
From Joyce to Radiohead, the Liffey is often mentioned in literature and song:

Fallow Deer

The Fallow Deer (Dama dama) is a type of deer from the family Cervidae. The animal originally lived in Eurasia, but people have brought it to other parts of the world like Australia. 
The male is called a "buck", the female is a "doe", and the young a "fawn". They live for about 12–16 years. All of the Fallow Deer have white spots on their backs, and black tips at the ends of their tails. Only bucks have antlers, which are wide and shaped like a shovel.
They are grazing animals. They like to live in an area that is mixed woodland and open grassland. They try to stay together in groups of up to 150.
They do have a lot of different coloured coats ("hair"). There are four main colours: "common", "menil", "melanistic" and "white". 
The Common coat is a brown coat with white spots that are best seen in the summer. In the winter the coat is much darker. The white coat is lightest colored, almost white. The common and menil coat are darker. The melanistic coat is very dark, sometimes even black. 
One noted historical herd of fallow deer is located in the Ottenby Preserve in Öland, Sweden. Karl X Gustav built a drystone wall of four kilometres long around a royal fallow deer herd in the mid 17th century. The herd still exists as of 2006.
Another herd lives in Phoenix Park in Ireland. 400-450 fallow deer descend from the original herd introduced in the 1660s.

MacDonnell Ranges

The MacDonnell Ranges are a long narrow range of mountains in the Northern Territory of Australia. They run in an almost straight line from east to west for hundreds of kilometres, on either side of Alice Springs. The Western MacDonnell Ranges have some spectacular gaps right through the range. Some of these such as Simpsons Gap, and Standley Chasm are major tourist attractions. The Heavitree Gap allows road and rail access to Alice Springs right through the mountains. They were named by the explorer John McDouall Stuart after Sir Richard MacDonnell, the Governor of South Australia.
The ranges are protected by the West MacDonnell National Park There is a long walking trail along the ranges called the Larapinta Trail.
The Arrente people, the indigenous Australian people who live in the area, believe the mountains were once giant caterpillars, called "Yerrenye".
