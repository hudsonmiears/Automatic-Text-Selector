Help:Navigation

When viewing any page on a MediaWiki wiki, you'll find three main navigation elements:
The sidebar is displayed on the left edge of the page below the site logo (if using the default MonoBook skin). This sidebar gives you access to important pages in the wiki such as Recent changes or Upload file. 
Clicking on the logo brings you back to the main page of the wiki. The links in the navigation section just below will take you to important pages of the wiki. These links can be configured by site administrators.
The contains a selection of links which change depending on what type of page you are viewing.
The page tabs are displayed at the top of the article to the right of the site logo (if using the default MonoBook skin). These tabs allow you to perform actions or view pages that are related to the current article. The available default actions include: viewing, changing, and discussing the current article. The specific tabs displayed on your pages depend on whether or not you are logged into the wiki and whether you have sysop (administrator) privileges on the wiki. On special pages only the namespace tab is displayed.
Administrators can add or remove tabs by using JavaScript or installing extensions, so the tabs you see may be different depending on which wiki you are using.
The user links are displayed at the top far right of the article (if using the default MonoBook skin). These tabs allow the logged-in user to view and change their user page and wiki preferences. Additionally, the user links allow the user to quickly access their contributions to the wiki and logout.
For anonymous users the user links is replaced by a link to the wiki login page or, if enabled, a link to your IP address and your IP address's talk page.

<doc id="165647" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=165647" title="Help:Range blocks">
Help:Range blocks

Range blocks are technical restrictions applied through to a group of IP addresses that prevent them from editing, creating new accounts, sending email through the wiki interface, et cetera. Registered accounts editing from these IP addresses will also be blocked, unless you check the box to only block anonymous editors.
Range blocking is enabled on all Wikimedia wikis; to enable it on other wikis, add "codice_1" in .
To block an IP range from , enter the first IP address in the range followed by a forward slash and a Classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) suffix. You should avoid performing range blocks unless you understand what you are doing, or you may end up blocking tens of thousands of people who are not the problem!
CIDR notation is written as the IP address, a slash, and the CIDR affix (for example, the IPv4 "codice_2" or IPv6 "codice_3"). The CIDR affix is the number of starting digits every IP address in the range have in common when written in binary. 
For example: "codice_4" is binary "codice_5", so codice_6 will match the first 27 digits ("codice_5"). The IP addresses codice_4–codice_9, when converted to binary, all have the same 27 first digits and will be blocked if codice_6 is blocked.
As the CIDR affix increases, the block affects fewer IP addresses (see table of example ranges). CIDR affixes are not the same for IPv4 addresses as they are for IPv6 addresses.
You can use the table of sample ranges below to guess the range, use a computer script, or manually calculate the range.
The first step in manually calculating a range is to convert the first and last IP address to binary representation. (This assumes you're not using a computer script, which can probably calculate the range for you anyway.) An IP address is composed of four groups of eight ones and zeros. Each group represents a number from 0 to 255. To convert a number to binary, you can use a reference table or know the value of each binary digit:
Proceeding from left to right, fill in '1' if the number is at least that value, and subtract that value (if it's not, fill in '0' and don't subtract). For example, to calculate 240:
Thus, 240 is 1111 0000 because it can be represented as 128+64+32+16+0+0+0+0.
The example below calculates the CIDR range between 69.208.0.0 and 69.208.0.255. Note that this is a simple example; some groups of IP addresses do not so neatly fit CIDR affixes, and need multiple different-sized blocks to block the exact range.
 IP addresses:

The table below shows the IP blocks each CIDR suffix affects. Note that MediaWiki only supports blocking CIDR suffixes 16–32.

Help:Redirect

You may start a new page with the name you want to direct from (see ). You can also use an existing page that you are making inactive as a page by going to that page and using the "change" tab at the top. In either case, you will be putting the following code at the very first text position of the change window for the page:
where "pagename" is the name of the destination page. The word "redirect" is not case-sensitive, but there must be no space between the "#" symbol. Any text before the code will disable the code and prevent a redirect. Any text or regular content code after the redirect code will be ignored (and should be deleted from an existing page). However, to put or keep the current page name listed in a Category, the usual tag for that category is entered or kept on a line after the redirect code entry.
You should use the 'preview' button below the change window, or Alt-P, to check that you have entered the correct destination page name. The preview page will not look like the resulting redirect page, it will look like a numbered list, with the destination page in blue: 
If the "pagename" as you typed it is not a valid page, it will show in red. Until there is a valid destination page, you should not make the redirect.
After making a redirect at a page, you can no longer get to that page by using its name or by any link using that name; and they do not show up in wiki search results, either. However, near the top of the destination page, a notice that you have been forwarded appears, with the source pagename as an active link to it. Click this to get back to the redirected page, showing the large bent arrow symbol and the destination for the redirect.
By doing this, you can do all the things that any wiki page allows. You can go to the associated discussion page to discuss the redirect. You can view the history of the page, including a record of the redirect. You can change the page if the redirect is wrong, and you can revert to an older version to remove the redirect.
There's generally no need to delete redirects. They do not occupy a significant amount of database space. If a page name is vaguely meaningful, there's no harm (and some benefit) in having it as a redirect to the more relevant or current page. 
If you do need to delete a redirect, e.g. if the page name is offensive, or you wish to discourage people from referring to a concept by that name, then you simply go to the redirect page as mentioned above, and follow the procedures at .
A double redirect is a page redirecting to a page which is itself a redirect, and it will not work. Instead, people will be presented with a view of the next redirect page. This is a deliberate restriction, partly to prevent infinite loops, and partly to keep things simple. 
However, you could look out for double redirects and eliminate them, by changing them to be 1-step redirects instead. You are most likely to need to do this after a significant . Use the "what links here" toolbox link to find double redirects to a particular page, or use to find them throughout the whole wiki.

Help:Signatures

Users can easily sign their posts at the end of a comment. The common format to type a signature – two hyphens (or a dash) followed by four tildes (-- ~~~~). This comes from the computer network Usenet, where two hyphens mark a signature block. The tildes automatically change to the actual username (linked to the right user page etc.) and timestamp (time/date), when you save a signed edit. This helps other users to follow the timing order of discussions, and to find the author of a particular comment. Signing is normally done on only, not on written articles. Signatures do not work in edit summaries (they do not change from ~~~~ to your username).
If you edit without logging in, your IP address will take the place of your username.
There are three options. Four tildes are standard (full signature). Typing three tildes results in a username-only signature (without timestamp). Typing five tildes results in a pure timestamp (without username).
Registered users can customize their signature (the part between the two hyphens and the timestamp) by changing the field "Signature" in their . By default, anything you enter there will be wrapped with codice_1. To use a special linking (without this automatic link), you have to check the tickbox for "Raw signatures." Then you can add Wiki markup and also HTML (as far as allowed on the wiki) as you like, but the most in length you can do is 255 characters.

Before deleting you could perform various checks:
The care taken over these things might depend on the size of the wiki community, and how clear-cut the case for deletion is. Remember that only sysop users can undo a delete action, so to a normal user the information appears to be lost forever.
Sysops should see a 'delete' tab at the top of every page. Click this to delete the page. You will be asked to confirm, and to supply a "Reason for deletion". This is a short textual description of why the page is being deleted. Your action will appear on the recent changes display, and in the deletion log ().
To undelete a page you must navigate to the exact page name of the page. You can find this in the deletion log () if you don't remember it.

Help:Sysops and permissions

Wikis are often set up to be freely and openly editable. This means anyone can edit the pages, often without even registering/logging in. This is only possible because wikis offer a unique kind of "soft security". By making it very simple to monitor edits, and revert changes to retrieve an older version of a page, a wiki doesn't need to be very restrictive at all.
There "are" no permissions. Everyone is an administrator. You don't need permission to edit, and you are encouraged to "be bold", go forth and edit!
...at least that is the theory. In practice MediaWiki software does offer many options related to permissions.
By default MediaWiki provides extra functionality to a group of trusted users called 'sysops' (or known more generally as 'administrators') Most of the time this should go largely unnoticed by the normal users of a wiki community. Everyone can get involved in editing pages, and even undertaking drastic reorganisation of the wiki. The extra powers of a sysop user are intended for use in settling disputes and preventing repeated vandalism.
You can find out who the sysops are at 
There are a number of extra features available to sysops. The key ones are as follows:
Another level of permissions within a default MediaWiki set-up, is the 'bureaucrat' group.
The main thing a bureaucrat can do, which 'sysop' cannot, is promote users to be sysops (and demote sysops to normal users). See

Help:Tables

Tables may be set up in wiki pages using either HTML table elements, or wikicode. HTML table elements will not be discussed here (see web pages if you're interested). The benefit of wikicode is that the table is made of character symbols. This makes it easier to imagine the table when you work in the editing box. 
As a general rule, it is best to avoid using a table unless you need one. Table markup often complicates page editing.
Wiki table markup, or wiki markup or just marks are words used to describe to control codes. Control codes are symbols used that tell wikipedia how to display something. When a person looks at a page in wikipedia, the wiki markup can make the text look special, such as bold, large, or in a table. The person viewing the page does not see the wiki markup. Only the editor (the person that writes the page) sees the wiki markup.
Table borders defined with CSS rather than the border attribute will display wrong in a small number of text browsers.

Help:Template

If you have standard texts you want to include on several pages, the MediaWiki template feature comes into play.
Templates are standard wiki pages whose content is designed to be transcluded (embedded) inside other pages. Templates follow a convention that the name is prefixed with "codice_1", assigning it to that namespace. Therefore you can .
Templates are wiki pages which can be used in other pages in three ways:
In fact, an ordinary wiki page can also be used as a template, simply by qualifying the namespace it resides in, so:
If no such namespace exists, the full title is assumed to be a template:
You can define parameters in templates either numbered as codice_14 or named codice_14. 
Example: You want a little thank you note you can put on the talk page of other users. It will contain a reason and your signature. You could create to enter your text, as in the example in the table.
When using the template on a page, you fill in the parameter values, separated by a pipe char (|): codice_2. For named parameters use "name=value" pairs separated by a pipe char: codice_2. The advantage of using named parameters in your template is that they are flexible in order. It also makes the template easier to understand if you have many parameters. If you want to change the order of numbered parameters, you have to mention them explicitly: codice_2.
You can also provide default values for parameters, i.e. values that are going to be used if no value is provided for a parameter. For example, codice_14 would result in "all your hard work" if no value was provided for the parameter reason.
You can control template inclusion by the use of <code>
</pre></div>
Then, an editor can simply copy and paste the example to create a similar page.
Templates often require CSS or other templates, so users frequently have trouble copying templates from one wiki to another. The steps below should work for most templates:

Plant sap

Plant sap, or just sap, is fluid transported in xylem tubes or phloem cells of a plant. Xylem cells transport water and inorganic nutrients through the plant; phloem cells transport sugary fluids and other biological molecules.
Latex or resin is not plant sap. They are separately produced, with different components and functions.
Xylem sap is mainly water, with plant hormones, mineral elements and other nutrients in a dilute solution. Sap in xylem moves from roots towards the leaves.
Phloem sap is water, with manufactured sugars, other biological molecules and mineral elements dissolved in it. It flows from where carbohydrates are produced or stored to where they are used.
A large number of animals, all of the single insect order Hemiptera, feed directly on phloem sap, and make it the primary component of their diet. Phloem sap is "nutrient-rich compared with many other plant products and generally lacking in toxins and feeding deterrents, [but] it is consumed as the sole diet by a very restricted range of animals". Phloem sap is physiologically extreme in terms of animal digestion: it is thought that few animals take direct advantage of this because they lack adaptations to this diet.
Many more consume phloem sap by proxy, feeding on the honeydew (a sweet secretion) of phloem-feeding hemipterans. Honeydew is physiologically less extreme than phloem sap. Others feed on the biomass of insects which have grown on direct ingestion of phloem sap.
Many products are made from plant sap. One of them is maple syrup. Maple syrup is made using sap from sugar maple trees.
Sap colour is different for different plants.

Threatened species

Threatened species are any species (including animals, plants, and fungi) which might soon become extinct.
The World Conservation Union (IUCN) are the experts on threatened species. They put threatened species into three groups, each group in more danger than the next: 
One way scientists can work out how threatened a species is, is to measure the birth and death rates. If a species becomes small in numbers, it can get to a critical point. This happens when there are not enough individuals left alive to continue the species (critical depensation).
Species that are not a threatened species, but are still a concern, can be put into groups of Near Threatened, Least Concern, and Conservation Dependent. Conservation dependent is no longer used a group. When the species has not been studied, Not Evaluated, or there is not enough information, Data Deficient, the IUCN does not put them on the threatened species list.
Threatened species are also called "red listed" species, because they are in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
Under the Endangered Species Act in the United States, "threatened" means any species which is likely to become endangered in the near future, in all, or a large part of its range. The Bay checkerspot butterfly ("Euphydryas editha bayensis") is an example of a threatened species protected by the Endangered Species Act.

The show spoofs many other reality shows, taking on elements of "Survivor", "Fear Factor" and "Iron Chef". Every week, both teams compete in a challenge. The winning team becomes immune to getting kicked off the show (called "invincibility"), while the losing team has to do an internal vote to select who is eliminated. That night, the losing team meets around a campfire, where Chris Mclean, the show's producer, gives each camper a marshmallow. The camper with the least votes for leaving gets the first marshmallow, the camper with the second least votes gets the second marshmallow, and so on, until the camper with the most votes for elimination is left. The camper that got the most votes is eliminated then, and must walk down the ""Dock of Shame" to the "Boat of The Losers"".
There are the twenty two participants who get selected for the reality show Total Drama Island:
Cartoon Network has broadcast the show in many parts of Europe due to the Pan-European feed. Jetix has been broadcasting the show in The Netherlands, and the UK.

Standartenführer

Standartenführer was a Nazi Party rank that was used in both the S.A. and the S.S.. First started as a rank in 1925, in 1928 the rank became one of the first commissioned Nazi ranks and was given to S.A. and S.S. officers who commanded units known as "Standarten" which were between three hundred and five hundred men.
In 1929 the rank of Standartenführer was split into two ranks known as "Standartenführer (I)" and "Standartenführer (II)". This idea was given up in 1930 when both the S.A. and S.S. grew their rank systems to allow for more ranks.
By the start of World War II, Standartenführer was widely used as both an SS rank and a rank of the S.A.. In the Waffen-SS, the rank was considered the equivalent of an "Oberst" (colonel). 
The insignia for Standartenführer was of a single oak leaf worn on both collars and was the first of the S.S. and S.A. ranks to be worn on both collars. From 1938, newer SS uniforms featured the shoulder boards of a German Oberst as well as the oak leaf collar patches.

<doc id="165736" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=165736" title="Stamp Act">
Stamp Act

A stamp act is a law that puts a tax on the transfer of some documents. Those that pay the tax get an official stamp on their documents. Many products have been covered by stamp acts such as playing cards, patent medicines, cheques, mortgages, contracts and newspapers. The items often have to be physically stamped at approved government offices following payment of the duty, although other methods with annual payment of a fixed sum or purchase of adhesive stamps are more practical and common. Stamp acts have been made common in many countries, like Australia, China, Canada, Ireland, Malaysia, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States.
The money raised by the tax, called stamp duty, was first used in the Netherlands in 1624 after a public competition to find a new form of tax. However, it has more been used in Great Britain and its colonies.
The Stamp Act of 1765 was upsetting to some American colonists and was one of the causes of the American Revolutionary War.

Gary Oldman

Gary Oldman (born Gary Leonard Oldman; 21 March 1958) is a British actor and movie-maker. He is known for his starring role in the 1992 movie "Dracula". His other roles include Sid Vicious in "Sid and Nancy", Sirius Black in the Harry Potter movies, George Smiley in "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy", Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg in "The Fifth Element", Egor Korshunov in "Air Force One", Norman Stansfield in "", and as James Gordon in "The Dark Knight Trilogy".
Oldman was born in New Cross, London on 21 March 1958. He is the son of housewife Kathleen (née Cheriton; born 28 November 1919), and Leonard Bertram Oldman (21 May 1921 – October 1985), a former sailor who also worked as a welder. Oldman has stated that his father was an alcoholic who left the family when Oldman was seven years old. Oldman attended West Greenwich School in Deptford, leaving school at the age of 16 to work in a sports shop.
Oldman has earned renown for his classical acting style and diversity, being hailed by famous movie critics such as Roger Ebert and Peter Travers as one of cinema's great actors. Peer Colin Firth described him as "a very strong candidate for the world’s best living actor". An Academy Award nominee, Oldman has won two BAFTA Awards and a Saturn Award, as well as Emmy Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Palme d'Or nominations.
Oldman's performances during his career have provided inspiration for younger actors who would go on to enjoy successful Hollywood careers: Tom Hardy has described Oldman as his "absolute complete and utter hero", and "hands down, the greatest actor that's ever lived"; Brad Pitt, Daniel Radcliffe, Benedict Cumberbatch and Ryan Gosling have also cited Oldman as their favourite actor. Other actors such as Christian Bale, Shia LaBeouf, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Johnny Depp, Chris Pine, Jason Isaacs and Michael Fassbender have praised Oldman as well.
Oldman married his first wife, Lesley Manville, in 1987 but left her in 1989 three months after their son, Alfie, was born. He met American actress Uma Thurman on the set of "State of Grace", and they were married in 1990, but the marriage ended two years later. Oldman then settled into a relationship with actress and model Isabella Rossellini. The couple were rumoured to be engaged in July 1994 but separated two years later. Oldman was married to Donya Fiorentino from 1997 to 2001 and has sons Gulliver Flynn (b. 20 August 1997) and Charlie John (b. 11 February 1999) with her.
On 31 December 2008, Oldman married English jazz singer Alexandra Edenborough in Santa Barbara, California in a private, formal ceremony. Oldman currently lives in Los Angeles with his family.

Leathermouth (also spelled as LeATHERMØUTH) is an American post-hardcore rock band. The band was started in 2007 by My Chemical Romance's guitarist Frank Iero. On January 2009, the band released their first album, "XO".
Leathermouth started in 2007 by some friends of My Chemical Romance's rhythm guitarist Frank Iero. Iero heard a few demo songs from the band, and wanted to sign the band to his own independent label. He later joined the band after the first lead singer did not write any lyrics to the songs. As a member of Leathermouth, this is the first band where he writes the lyrics and does lead vocals. Iero uses the band as a way to express about the way he sees the world and also to let out his personal problems with depression and anxiety. Leathermouth played their first shows in the summer of 2008 alongside Warship for the Fall 2008 Reggie and the Full Effect "Farewell Tour". Iero hopes to tour with Leathermouth when he is not working with My Chemical Romance.
In October 2008, Leathermouth signed to Epitaph Records, rather than to Frank Iero's label as originally planned. Iero thought that it would be hard to advertise the album himself if it was released through his own label, with his current responsibilities to My Chemical Romance and the other bands signed to his label. Epitaph Records president, Brett Gurewitz, was impressed with the band's "intensity and songwriting of the music." Leathermouth released their first studio album, "XO" on January 27, 2009 through Epitaph. Even though the album did not become listed on the Billboard 200, it did reach #21 on the Top Heatseekers chart.

Bakerloo line

The Bakerloo line is a line of the London Underground, coloured brown on the Tube map. It runs partly on the surface and partly at deep level, from Elephant and Castle in south-east to Wealdstone in north-west of London. The lines serves 25 stations of which 15 are underground. It is the seventh busiest line on the network and platforms are 110 metres long.
"Note: For the former Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo line, see the Jubilee line article."
The extension to Camberwell was a plan to extend the Bakerloo Line. The project was to start at the late 1940s, but they cancelled it for an unknown reason. Then in the 21st century, they revised the extension plan and proposed it again. So far, nothing has been agreed. The 1940s version of the extension had two stations. One rumour of why they cancelled the project was because Camberwell was quite a bad location to do further extensions.
Between 1917 and 1982, Bakerloo line trains continued along the DC line past Harrow & Wealdstone to Watford Junction. These stations continue to be served by London Overground.
The Stanmore branch was originally constructed by the Metropolitan Railway (now the Metropolitan line) and was transferred to the Bakerloo line in 1939. It was transferred to the Jubilee line on May 1 1979. It connected to the main line at Baker Street.

Lemuriformes

Lemuriformes are an infraorder of Primates. It combines the lemurs of Madagascar, with the galagos and lorises of Africa and Asia.
The lorises and lemurs are a monophyletic clade. However, a popular alternative taxonomy puts the lorises in their own infraorder, the Lorisiformes.
Lemuriform origins are unclear and debated. The main problem is a lack of clear transitional fossils.
Molecular clock estimates suggest that lemurs and the lorisoids diverged in Africa during the Paleocene, about 62 mya. Between 47 and 54 mya, lemurs got to Madagascar by rafting. In isolation, the lemurs diversified and filled the niches often filled by monkeys and apes today.
In Africa, the lorises and galagos diverged during the Eocene, about 40 mya. Unlike the lemurs in Madagascar, they have had to compete with monkeys and apes, as well as other mammals.
Because the skeletons of adapiforms share strong similarities with those of lemurs and lorises, researchers have often referred to them as "primitive" strepsirrhines, lemur ancestors, or a sister group to the living strepsirrhines. They are included in Strepsirrhini, and are considered basal members of the clade.
Although their status as true primates is not questioned, their relationship with other primates in Strepsirrhini is unclear. Sometimes they are put in their own infraorder; sometimes they are sometimes reduced to families in the Lemuriformes.

A regiment is a military unit, made up of a number of battalions, run by a Colonel. A modern regiment can also be similar to a brigade, in that both can be from a few hundred soldiers to 5,000 soldiers (from 3 to 7 battalions). The modern regiment's size changes in number, purpose, and role from country to country (and might not exist in some military forces) and sometimes even within the military of the same nations.

The German Cross () was begun by Adolf Hitler on 16 November 1941 as an award that was a higher level than the Iron Cross First Class but below the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. It was given in two classes: gold and silver (the color of the laurel around the swastika), the gold was given out for bravery, the silver was given out for service.
This award was also available in cloth, which made for easier wear on the combat uniform.
The title of the award is taken from the fact that the swastika is a type of cross.

University of the City of Manila

Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM), or the University of the City of Manila, is a university in the city of Manila. It is funded by the government of the city and it does not have any tuition fees. It is in the district of Intramuros in Manila, the Philippines. It was established on June 19, 1965 and opened on July 17, 1967 to 556 scholars, all coming from the top ten percent of graduates of Manila's public high schools. and opened on July 17, 1967.
PLM holds the distinction of being the first in several ways— the first institution of higher learning in the country and perhaps in Asia to offer tuition-free tertiary education; the first university funded solely by a city government; and the first institution of higher learning in the country to have its official name in Filipino.
From its first enrollment record of 556 freshman scholars coming from the top ten percent of the graduating classes of Manila's twenty-nine public high schools, total semestral enrollment has grown to an average of 11,000. The lone college in its earliest beginning has sprung to 12 colleges, five graduate, two professional schools, and a score of research and specialized centers, including a teaching hospital, an enterpreneurial center, and an integrated learning center for toddlers. In addition, it maintains a comprehensive distance education and open university program for thousands of community health workers and public administrators in various regions nationwide with affiliations and recognition from various national and international organizations and institutions.
To date, there are 53 single-degree baccalaureate programs and 49 masters, doctoral, and graduate diploma offerings that lead to degrees in accountancy, economics, architecture, business administration, computer studies, education, engineering, law, mass communication, mathematics, medicine, nursing, physical education, physical therapy, psychology, sciences, social work, tourism, management, and public governance.
According to the Philippines' Commission on Higher Education (CHED), it is a model university for all public institutions across the country, one of the centers of excellence in the City of Manila, and the fifth among all universities nationwide based on the number of examinees passing the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) test.
As a university with its own charter, PLM enjoys certain level of autonomy. It is governed by the Board of Regents and administered by a President. The Board of Regents has the authority to grant diplomas, certificates and titles to students who have completed their academic programs and validate graduation of students. The six-member Board is composed of the President of the PLM, a representative of the PLM faculty, a distinguished alumnus, a respected educator, and one other respected professional, and the Superintendent of the Division of City Schools-Manila. Each member serves a six-year tenure of office. The President oversees the implementation of the university policies. Immediately under the President are the offices of four Vice-Presidents - Executive Vice President, Vice President for Academic Affairs, Vice President for Administration, and Vice President for Finance and Planning.
The University is organized into twelve undergraduate colleges, two professional schools, seven graduate schools, and an open university and distance learning program, which are all being supervised by the Executive Vice President. These academic units collectively provide 53 single-degree undergraduate and 49 masters, doctoral and graduate diploma programs.
The twelve undergraduate colleges are the College of Accountancy & Economics, College of Architecture & Urban Planning, College of Engineering & Technology, College of Human Development, College of Liberal Arts, College of Management & Entrepreneurship, College of Mass Communication, College of Nursing, College of Physical Education, Recreation & Sports, College of Physical Therapy, College of Science, and College of Tourism, Hotel & Travel Industry Management. The two professional schools are the College of Law and the College of Medicine. The seven graduate schools include Graduate School of Arts, Sciences & Education, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Graduate School of Engineering, Graduate School of Law, Graduate School of Management, Graduate School of Urban & Settlements Planning, and the President Ramon Magsaysay School of Public Governance. The university's open university and distance learning program is served through the Emeritus College, Open University, and the District Colleges.
PLM is the tenth largest university in Metro Manila with a total student enrollment of 13,711 (as of January 20, 2006). For the undergraduate class of 2011, PLM received 40,000 college applications, and accepted three percent of them.
PLM's endowment in 2008 was valued at PhP 500 million, excluding the funding allotted for its teaching hospital, Ospital ng Maynila Medical Center, of about PhP 250 million. The University spends about four to fives times the national average for education. 
PLM utilizes a semester-based modular system for conducting courses, adopts features of the American system (credits), and employs the General Weighted Average (GWA) system and a 1.00 to 5.00 grading scale, with 1.00 being the highest possible grade for a particular undergraduate course.
The semestral calendar being used by PLM consists of two regular semesters of about 15 to 16 weeks each, and semestral breaks of about three to four weeks each. The university requires a minimum of twelve units to be considered a full-time student, with the maximum being twenty units.
The late President, Diosdado Macapagal, who himself visited the University, said that PLM is "a unique university because it is the first community-oriented and socially conscious university in the country." He added that, "it gives poor but deserving public high school graduates of the community the means to acquire higher education." Moreover, he recognized PLM's emerging status as "one of the top universities in the country." Her daughter, President, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo cited PLM for having a "culture of excellence," and commended the university for what she had believed as its "impressive" accomplishments in various fields. 
The country's leading newspaper, The Philippine Daily Inquirer, described PLM as a local university with a national character and reputation. US Ambassador Kristie Kenney, in her speech during the 40th Commencement Exercises at the PLM Grandstand, praised PLM for building a "culture of commitment to public service in its students, faculty and alumni." In an article in the Business Mirror, PLM was considered as the "highest symbol of Manila’s public educational system which radiates another form of power and influence." Websites such as Manila Board regarded that PLM is one of leading and prime public universities in the country today.
On August 13, 2008, Adel A. Tamano, in his column at the "Manila Times" wrote that PLM is "a unique learning institution" and is "essentially an "honors school" where only the students from lower income families with excellent scholastic records are admitted."
PLM is not a perfect institution, and the university had been criticized in the past for the 'reconsideration' cases, wherein some students who failed to meet the university’s standards for retention were readmitted because of the so-called 'backers'. In order to resolve this issue, the city government has insulated the University from political pressure so as not to compromise its status as one of the country's leading educational institutions.[1] [2]
The site of the PLM campus at Intramuros used to be occupied by the Colegio de Manila (also known as Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio), which was founded in 1590 by Fr. Antonio Sedeño, S.J. The Colegio de Manila formally opened in 1595, and was the first school in the Philippines.
Aside from Colegio de Manila, there were other structures that were built in the site. Iglesia de Santa Ana, the first stone church in the Philippines, was built in 1590 and opened in 1596. However, an earthquake destroyed it, and another church was built in honor of St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1626.
In 1601, the Colegio de San José was set up as an annex of Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio. Twenty years later, Pope Gregory XV, through the Archbishop of Manila, authorized the Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio to confer degrees in theology and arts and elevated it into a university. In 1623, Philip IV of Spain confirmed the authorization, making the school both a pontifical and a royal university, and the very first university in the Philippines and in Asia. In 1722, the Colegio de San José was granted "royal patronage". 
In 1768, the Jesuits surrendered the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio to the Spanish authorities after their suppression and expulsion from Spain and its territories. Later, the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio was placed under secular administration and converted into a seminary and a liberal arts college. In 1773, Pope Clement XIV formally declared the dissolution of the Society of Jesus. In 1895, the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio merged with the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of the University of Santo Tomas. The Colegio de San José is now the San José Major Seminary at the Ateneo de Manila University.
The buildings of what was the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio were transformed into military headquarters called Cuartel del Rey, which eventually became known as Cuartel de España. José Rizal was placed on trial for sedition here on December 26, 1896.
During the American occupation, part of the barracks was razed, and a gymnasium was built on it. In early 1930s, one of first games of the NCAA was played in the 31st Infantry Quonset Gym. The buildings and the whole premises served as military headquarters for the 31st Infantry of the United States Army until 1941. During World War II, General Douglas McArthur held command post here, but the entire area was later destroyed by the ongoing military conflict.
In early 1960s, the site was rehabilitated by the city government and a building was constructed at General Luna Street to house the students of Manila High School. However, on April 24, 1965, the late President Diosdado Macapagal issued Proclamation 392-A, giving to the proposed city university the three-hectare lot being occupied by Manila High School. On February 26, 1967, the new complex along Victoria Street was inaugurated, and the students of Manila High School was transferred there. On July 17, 1967, the first group of PLM scholars began studying on the site where the modern educational system in the Philippines started.
The call to open a university run by the city government of Manila began during the term of Mayor Arsenio H. Lacson when Ordinance No. 4202 was approved by the City councilors on January 13, 1960. The said ordinance allotted a total of PhP 1,000,000 for the construction of the university. However, Mayor Lacson did not however live to see the realization of this project as he died suddenly of heart attack. Vice Mayor Antonio Villegas took over and continued Lacson's plan. He later issued Executive Order No. 7, s-1963 that created the committee that would draw up the plan of founding a university. But some difficulty prevented the university's formal creation. As a result, he sought the help of Congressman Justo R. Albert, representative of the City's fourth congressional district. Congressman Albert then sponsored House Bill No. 8349 at the Philippines' House of Representatives. The Senate version of the bill was authored by Senators Gil Puyat and Camilo Osias.
The two bills were eventually combined into one, and it was discussed during the Fourth Session of the Fifth Congress of the Philippines on January 25, 1965. The final bill was later passed by the joint Congress and signed by Senate President Ferdinand E. Marcos and House Speaker Cornelio T. Villareal with Mr. Regino S. Eustaquio, Secretary of the Senate, and Mr. Inocencio B. Pareja, Secretary of the House of Representatives.
On June 19, 1965, the final bill with the title - "An Act Authorizing the City of Manila to Establish and Operate the University of the City of Manila and for Other Purposes" - was signed into law by President Diosdado P. Macapacal in a signing ceremony at Malacañang Palace. The signing was witnessed by Atty. Primitivo de Leon, Mayor Villegas, Congressman Ramon Mitra Jr., and its main sponsor in the House of Representatives, Congressman Albert. The law was captioned as Republic Act No. 4196, which now serves as the University Charter.
With an enrollment of 556 students—both men and women—PLM opened for classes on July 17, 1967. All of them are housed under the University College, which offered liberal arts courses. After a year, a Graduate Institute for Teachers was founded, and it was followed by the Institute of Extramural Studies. At the turn of the decade, the school had expanded its offerings to include degree programs leading to specializations in communication, engineering, education, business administration, nursing.

Maple syrup

Maple syrup is a thick kind of syrup made from the sap of maple trees. It is made mostly of a type of sugar called sucrose, and is usually eaten together with waffles and pancakes. Sometimes, maple syrup is used to bake things such as pies, to make candy, or just as a syrup that adds sweetness to food. It is also sometimes used in making lemonade. 
It was used by eastern North America and later by European settlers. Syrups are usually packed when they are hot. The Canadian province of Quebec is by far the largest producer of maple syrup. It produces about three-quarters of the worlds maple syrup. In cold climates, maple trees keep starch in their trunks and root before the winter, but when spring arrives, the starch is converted to sugar/sucrose that rises the sap.

Pantheon

The Pantheon (meaning "Temple of all the gods") is a building in Rome. It was originally built as a temple to the gods of Ancient Rome, and rebuilt about 126 AD during Hadrian's reign. Today, it is not known what gods were included. 
The Pantheon is the best preserved of all Roman buildings. Since it was built, it has always been used. The design of the current building is sometimes credited to Trajan's architect Apollodorus of Damascus, but it may also been Emperor Hadrian's architects who designed it. Scholars now agree that it was not Hadrian himelf who built it. Since the 7th century, the Pantheon has been used as a Roman Catholic church. The Pantheon is the oldest standing domed structure in Rome. The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same, .
The Pantheon dome is the largest dome made mainly of unreinforced concrete. It does, however, contain other materials. According to the Jutland Archaeological Society investigations, the lower section of the dome is made of concrete with alternating layers of bricks and tuff; both have good affinity with the lime-pozzolan mortar which filled the voids. 
The term "pantheon" is sometimes used for a building where well-known dead people are buried.

Ardipithecus

Ardipithecus is a very early hominid genus, which lived during the late Neogene.
Two species are known: "A. kadabba", dated to about 5.6 million years ago (late Miocene), and "A. ramidus", which lived about 4.4 million years ago during the early Pliocene. 
Because this genus shares several traits with the African great ape genera ("Pan" and "Gorilla"), some place it on the that branch rather than human branch. 
Most consider it a proto-human because of a likeness in teeth with "Australopithecus". "Ardipithecus" had bipedalism and reduced canines, like the Australopithecines.

Australopithecus anamensis

Australopithecus anamensis is a species of "Australopithecus". The first fossilized specimen of the species, though not recognized as such at the time, was a single arm bone found in Pliocene strata in the Kanapoi region of East Lake Turkana by a Harvard University research team in 1965. The specimen was tentatively assigned at the time to "Australopithecus" and dated about four million years old. Little additional information was uncovered until 1987, when Canadian archaeologist Allan Morton (with Harvard University's Koobi Fora Field School) discovered fragments of a specimen sticking out of a partially eroded hillside east of Allia Bay, near Lake Turkana, Kenya. 
Six years later the London-born Kenyan paleoanthropologist Meave Leakey and archaeologist Alan Walker excavated the Allia Bay site and uncovered several additional fragments of the hominid, including one complete lower jaw bone which closely resembles that of a common chimpanzee ("Pan troglodytes") but whose teeth are much more similar to those of a human. In 1995, Meave Leakey and her associates, taking note of differences between "Australopithecus afarensis" and the new finds, assigned them to a new species, "A. anamensis", deriving its name from the Turkana word anam, meaning "lake".

Thurgood Marshall

Thurgood Marshall (July 2, 1908 – January 24, 1993) was an American jurist and the first African American to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. Thurgood Marshall, earlier named Thoroughgood Marshall (which he changed in the 2nd grade), was born in Baltimore, Maryland. Marshall served on the Court from 1967 to 1991. In 1946 he was awarded the Springarn Medal for all of his achievements and hard work for the NAACP. Marshall had been one of the NAACP's top lawyers. He was one of the lawyers who argued "Brown v. Board of Education". He was also Solicitor General of the United States.
Thurgood Marshall attended Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore, Maryland and was in the class with the brightest students. He graduated a year early in 1925 with a B-grade average, and was in the top three of his class. He went on to attend Lincoln University and graduated in 1930. He applied to the University of Maryland Law School, but was denied admission because he was black. He later joined the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and became an active member. In 1934, Marshall became director of the NAACP, Legal Defense and for an Educational Fund. He won his first major civil rights case in Maryland in 1935 with the help of Charles Houston. He won 29 of 32 Supreme Court cases. He went on to argue thirty-two cases before the Supreme Court in 1940. Marshall argued in the Smith v. Allwright which disputed the rights of black people from voting in 1944. He also fought in the Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka about racial segregation in public schools in 1948, which was one of the biggest cases of the century. In 1954 the Supreme Court ended racial segregation in public schools. This was a rule violation of the 14th Amendment. It made way for integration and was a major victory of the civil rights movement. He then went on to investigate U.S. Army courts-martial in 1950-1951, in Japan and Korea to help African American soldiers. In 1961 John F. Kennedy appointed him to the US Court of Appeals and he won 29 cases before attending the Supreme Court.<br>
<br>
Between the years 1908-1993, he fought for individual rights. A quote that he wrote himself  “A child born to a black mother in a state like Mississippi….. has the same rights as a white boy born to the wealthiest person the United States. It’s not true, but I challenge anyone to say it is not a goal worth working for..” Marshall believed that both blacks and whites should have equal rights but it was not happening in the United States. He thought it was right for both rich and poor children to have equal rights. This quote had to do with Thurgood Marshall’s life because he was not rich but his parents and teachers worked hard to help him become a lawyer. He had to memorize the constitution. As a lawyer, he fought to end segregation between blacks and whites.
Thurgood Marshall was against the death penalty because he didn't think that it was necessary. He argued that there is no reason for the people who did something wrong, to go through the death penalty. He says that they should have a less painful punishment by going to prison instead. In 1990, Marshall said a lot of things about the death penalty and why he didn't want it enforced. 
Back in Thurgood Marshall's time, the time of segregation, some thought that if people were more open they would have seen the most important black male of the century. He joined the NAACP and argued in Brown v Board. To this day there is only one other black male in the Supreme Court justice. In his time in the Supreme Court he worked to end segregation and fought for the equal rights for all people. Even though he’s dead his legacy is still alive.

Emanuel Feuermann

Emanuel Feuermann (born Kolomyia, Austro-Hungarian Empire, 22 November 1902; died New York City, 25 May 1942) was a famous Austrian cellist who became a naturalized American. During his short career he was thought of as the world’s greatest cellist after Pablo Casals.
Feuermann's parents were amateur musicians. His father started to teach him the violin, but the young boy wanted to hold it between his legs like a cello, so his father bought him a small cello. In 1909 the family moved to Vienna so that he could learn the cello from the famous Friedrich Buxbaum, the cellist of the Rosé Quartet and principal cellist of the Vienna Philharmonic. Then he studied with Anton Walter at the Music Academy in Vienna. In February 1914, aged twelve, he played in his first concert, performing Joseph Haydn's Cello Concerto in D with the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Felix Weingartner. 
In 1917, Feuermann went to Leipzig where he studied with Julius Klengel. Klengel thought his young pupil was incredibly talented, but that he did not know much great cello music. Feuermann worked very hard. Klengel was a good teacher for him
In 1919 Friedrich Grützmacher died and Klengel recommended Feuermann should take his job at the Gürzenich Conservatory in Cologne. Although he was very young he got the job which had a very good salary, but he was not given the title of “professor”. 
During the 1920s he gave many concerts all over the world. In 1929 he became professor at the Musikhochschule in Berlin.He played with famous people such as the violinists Carl Flesch, Szymon Goldberg, Joseph Wolfsthal and Jascha Heifetz, the composer and viola player Paul Hindemith and the pianist Artur Rubinstein.
On April 3, 1933, with the rise of Nazism, he lost his job at the Berlin Conservatory because he was Jewish. He moved to London. He toured Japan and the United States where he played the Haydn concerto with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Bruno Walter. Some music critics were not very impressed with his playing. However, a few days later he gave a recital. Nearly all the professional cellists in New York were there because they had heard that Feuermann was an exceptional player. The audience were extremely enthusiastic and even the music critics changed their minds.
In 1935 he married. He moved to Zürich with his wife, but happened to be in Vienna at the time of the Anschluss while his wife and young daughter were still in Zürich. Bronislaw Huberman helped Feuermann and his family escape to Israel in September 1938. At the end of the year they went to the United States and applied for American citizenship.
He taught at the Curtis Institute of Music and gave concerts and made recordings with other great musicians including Artur Schnabel, Bronislaw Huberman and, especially, with the pianist Franz Rupp. 
Feuermann died in 1942 of an infection after a small operation for haemorrhoids.
Feuermann was one of the greatest cellists who ever lived. The cello was not often heard as a solo instrument in those days, but Feuermann and Pablo Casals made people change their minds. Feuermann did not actually practise very much on his own, but when he was making music with other people he worked very hard at all the detail. He loved teaching. He also loved fast cars. His family were very important indeed to him.
Many believe that Feuermann's interpretation of Antonín Dvořák's Cello Concerto and his performance of Johannes Brahms's Double Concerto with Jascha Heifetz are among the best ever.

Isabella of France

Isabella of France (1295 – 22 August 1358) was the Queen consort of England as the wife of Edward II of England. She was also Regent of England for her son Edward III of England during his minority. Until 1325 she was a traditional queen consort. After that time she had one of the worst reputations of any English queen.
She was the daughter of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre. As the daughter of two monarchs she was destined to be a queen. While France and England had a common culture, political relations between them were tense. To ease this situation Pope Boniface VIII arranged two marriages. This double-alliance was between Edward I of England and Marguerite of France and also the infant Edward II marrying Isabel. In 1299 the marriage between Edward I and Marguerite took place. The marriage between Edward II and Isabella would wait until she was old enough. They were married in 1308 at Boulogne-sur-Mer in France.
At age 12 the young bride was already considered a great beauty. Since his father's death a year earlier, the 24 year old Edward II was now king. But he showed very little interest in Isabella. His first act as king was to recall the exiled Piers Gaveston. One chronicler wrote "He had home his greatest love."
Whatever their relationship was exactly, Edward II regarded Gaveston with great affection. From the beginning of his marriage to Isabella their relationship was not good. Edward had no romantic interest in Isabella. Isabella soon found her husband was not giving her any money. She wrote to her father telling him she was living in poverty. King Philip quickly wrote back demanding Edward provide for his wife and any children they might have. Edward stalled by giving excuses. Meanwhile Isabella discovered that Piers Gaveston had been given many of the jewels her father had given her as part of her dowry. Isabella was furious. Her uncles warned Edward they would not attend their coronation unless he got rid of Gaveston. But Edward's barons had already made the same threats. Edward promised he would take care of everything when the parliament met in March. When Gaveston was put in charge of the coronation, one thing after another went wrong. At the banquet table honoring the king and queen, Gaveston sat next to the king instead of Isabella. He even displayed his Coat of arms next to the king's instead of Isabella's. The barons and Isabella's kinsmen were angry over these insults to their new queen. But it wasn't until 1311 that the barons drew up a list of ordinances the king had to follow. The first was to get rid of Piers Gaveston. But before 1312 Gaveston came back to England. That same year Isabella was pregnant with their first child. To escape the barons, Edward and Gaveston fled north taking Isabella with them. They left her unprotected at York while Edward and Gaveston escaped on a ship. But the barons were not upset with Isabella. Gaveston was captured and murdered in the summer of 1312. This didn't end Isabella's troubles as Edward found a new favorite in Hugh le Despenser. In November their first child was born, the future Edward III of England. But Despenser hated Isabella more than Gaveston. By 1321 she was virtually a prisoner. By 1324 Edward had given all her lands to Despenser.
In 1325 Edward convinced Isabella to go to France. Her brother Charles IV of France was now king. Edward wanted her to negotiate for him over Gascony. This was Isabella's chance for freedom. She even convinced her husband to send their son Edward (III) to join her. Edward soon realized his mistake and demanded she and his son return. Isabella ignored his demands and remained in France. The anger she must have felt over the years of mistreatment in England finally gave her a chance to rebel against her husband. She had their son, the future king of England with her and Edward could do nothing. At this time she was joined by Roger Mortimer an English exile. Another who came to her aid was Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, Edward II's half-brother. A number of Englishmen in France joined her cause. Many were upset with Edward II and the Despensers. 
But Isabella was short of funds. She and her followers went north to Hainaut to find more support. In turn for their support, she negotiated a marriage for her son Edward to Philippa of Hainaut. She also gave up any claims she had to the French crown. She now had an army from Hainaut with many Englishmen backing her. While living in Hainaut, she and Roger Mortimer had become lovers.
In 1326 Isabella and her army landed at Suffolk. Neither Edward or the Despensers could mount an army against her. Edward II was captured and lost his throne. His son Edward III was made king in his place, with his mother as regent. 
In 1321 when she was denied access to the Leeds Castle, she made her escort try to force their way in through the gate, and after they failed, she made 13 of her escort hang immediately. She had 4 children and at least 3 miscarriages. When she later died she was buried in her wedding dress.

Battle of France

In World War II, the Battle of France, also called the Fall of France, was the German invasion of France and the Low Countries, from 10 May 1940, and ended the Phoney War. The battle was made up of two parts. In the first, called "Fall Gelb" in German (called "Case Yellow" in English), German tank units pushed through the Ardennes, to circle the Allied units that moved into Belgium. The British Expeditionary Force and many French soldiers were saved by Allied boats from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo. In the second part of the battle, called "Fall Rot" in German ("Case Red" in English), from 5 June, German armed forces circled the Maginot Line to attack the rest of France. Italy began the war with the Allies on 10 June. The French government left Paris for Bordeaux, and Paris was taken over on 14 June. After the French Second Army Group surrendered on 22 June, France then gave up as a country on 25 June. For the Axis, the Battle of France was a big win.
France was split into a German-occupied part in the north and west, a small Italian-occupied part in the southeast, and a satellite state part in the south, called Vichy France. Southern France was taken over on 10 November 1942 and France was run by Germany until after the Allied return in 1944; the Low Countries were set free in 1944 and 1945.

Pandora

In Greek mythology, Pandora was the first mortal woman. According to Hesiod, each god helped create her by giving her unique gifts. Zeus ordered Hephaestus to mould her out of Earth. This was part of the punishment of mankind, because Prometheus had stolen the secret of fire. All the gods helped by giving her seductive gifts. Another name was found for her was Anesidora, she who sends gifts. This name was found inscribed against her figure on a white-ground "kylix" in the British Museum.
According to the myth, Pandora opened a jar ("pithos") and released all the evils of mankind. With the exception of plagues and diseases, Hesiod does not specify the evils in detail. When Pandora closed the jar again, only Hope was left inside. The word pithos has been translated the wrong way, which may have led to the idea of "Pandora's box". Pandora opened the jar because she was curious what was inside, and not because of malice.
The myth of Pandora is ancient, and there are several different Greek versions. It has been interpreted in different ways. In the literary versions, the myth is a kind of theodicy, it addresses the question why there is evil in the world. The oldest versiion is that of Hesiod, who wrote it in the 7th century BC. He shortly mentions it in his Theogony, in line 570, but does not name Pandora. In his Works and Days he gives the oldest known literary version of the story. There is an older story that tells that urns and jars can contain blessings and evils which is told in Homer's Illiad:
The immortals know no care, yet the lot they spin for man is full of sorrow; on the floor of Zeus' palace there stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the other with good ones. He for whom Zeus the lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he to whom Zeus sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the world, and he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither by gods nor men.
The Pandora myth first appears in lines 560–612 of Hesiod's poem the "Theogony". This version does not give the woman a name. Prometheus has stolen the gift of fire, and has given it to the humans. Zeus is angry about this and decides to punish men, as a compensation for the gift. He commands Hephaestus to make the first woman from earth. This woman is described as a "beautiful evil" whose descendants would torment the race of men. After Hephaestus does so, Athena dressed her in a silvery gown, an embroidered veil, garlands and a crown of gold. This woman is unnamed in the "Theogony", but is probably Pandora. Hesiod rewrote her myth in "Works and Days". When she first appears before gods and mortals, "wonder seized them" as they looked upon her. But she was "sheer guile, not to be withstood by men." Hesiod elaborates (590–93):
<poem>
From her is the race of women and female kind:
of her is the deadly race and tribe of women who
live amongst mortal men to their great trouble,
no helpmates in hateful poverty, but only in wealth.</poem>
Later, Hesiod tells that men who try to avoid the evil of women by avoiding marriage will fare no better (604–7):
<poem>
He reaches deadly old age without anyone to tend his years,
and though he at least has no lack of livelihood while he lives,
yet, when he is dead, his kinsfolk divide his possessions amongst them.</poem>
At the end, Hesiod says that occasionally a man finds a good wife, but still (609) "evil contends with good."
The more famous version of the myth comes from another of Hesiod's works, called "Works and Days". There, the myth is contained in lines 60 to 105. Hesiod tells about Pandora's origin. He also makes the scope of the misery she inflicts on mankind bigger. As before, she is created by Hephaestus, but now more gods help completing her (lines 63-82): Athena taught her needlework and weaving (63–4); Aphrodite "shed grace upon her head and cruel longing and cares that weary the limbs" (65–6); Hermes gave her "a shameful mind and deceitful nature" (67–8); Hermes also gave her the power of speech, putting in her "lies and crafty words" (77–80) ; Athena then clothed her (72); next she, Persuasion and the Charites adorned her with necklaces and other finery (72–4); the Horae adorned her with a garland crown (75). Finally, Hermes gives this woman a name: Pandora – "All-gifted" – "because all the Olympians gave her a gift" (81). The story is written in such a way that Pandora's feminine and deceitful nature is a small problem for mankind, because she brings a "pithos". This word is usually translated as jar, sometimes as a "box". The box contains "burdensome toil and sickness that brings death to men" (91–2), diseases (102) and "a myriad other pains" (100). 
Prometheus had warned his brother Epimetheus not to accept any gifts from Zeus. But Epimetheus did not listen; he accepted Pandora, who promptly scattered the contents of her jar. As a result, Hesiod tells us, "the earth and sea are full of evils" (101). One item, however, did not escape the jar (96–9), hope:
<poem>
Only Hope was left within her unbreakable house,
she remained under the lip of the jar, and did not
fly away. Before [she could], Pandora replaced the
lid of the jar. This was the will of aegis-bearing
Zeus the Cloudgatherer.</poem>
He does not tell the reader why hope remained in the jar.
Hesiod closes with this moral (105): "Thus it is not possible to escape the mind of Zeus."
Archaic and Classic Greek literature do not mention Pandora any more. Sophocles wrote a satyr play "Pandora, or The Hammerers", but very little is known of this play. Sappho may have made reference to Pandora in a surviving fragment.
Later, people filled in small details, or they added postscripts to Hesiod's story. Examples for this are Apollodorus and Hyginus: Each of them added a part to the story, that might have already been in Hesiod's version, even though it was not written down: Epimetheus married Pandora. They each add that they had a daughter, Pyrrha, who married Deucalion and survived the deluge with him. The problem of that version is that Hesiod's Catalogue of Women", fragment #2, had made a "Pandora" one of the "daughters" of Deucalion, and the mother of Graecus by Zeus. 
In the 15th century, a monk named Annio da Viterbo said he had found a manuscript of a historian named Berossus. Berossus had lived in the 3rd century BC. According to the manuscript, "Pandora" was also named as a daughter-in-law of Noah. This attempt to join pagan and Christian texts was later recognised as a forgery, though. 
The poet Theognis of Megara, who lived in the 6th century BC, had a different view:
<poem>
Hope is the only good god remaining among mankind;
the others have left and gone to Olympus.
Trust, a mighty god has gone, Restraint has gone from men,
and the Graces, my friend, have abandoned the earth.
Men’s judicial oaths are no longer to be trusted, nor does anyone
revere the immortal gods; the race of pious men has perished and
men no longer recognize the rules of conduct or acts of piety.</poem>
Theogonis seems to be referring to a different version of the myth: In that version, the jar contained blessings rather than evils. This version seems to follow a tradition before Hesiod, which was preserved by 2nd century writer Babrius. According to Babrius, the gods sent a jar containing blessings to humans. A "foolish man" (not Pandora) opened the jar, and most of the blessings were lost forever. Only hope remained, "to promise each of us the good things that fled."
Attic red-figure painters seem to have had a tradition which was independent of the literary sources: Sometimes, they add to the literary version, sometimes they ignore it altogether. 
There are many ways in which the figure of Pandora can be interpreted. Erwin Panofsky wrote a monography on the subject. According to M. L. West, the story of Pandora and the jar is older than Hesiod's versions. This also explains the confusion and problems of Hesiod's version and that it is inconclusive. According to West, Pandoora was married to Prometheus in these versions. West cites Hesiod's "Catalogue of Women", which preserved the older version. In one version of the story, the jar may have contained only good things for mankind. West also writes that it may have been that Epimetheus and Pandora and their roles were transposed in the pre-Hesiodic myths. This is called a "mythic inversion". He remarks that there is a curious correlation between Pandora being made out of earth in Hesiod's story, to what is in Apollodorus that Prometheus created man from water and earth. Hesiod's myth of Pandora's jar, then, could be an summary of many different early myths.
There are different questions that need to be discussed. The Greek original text speaks about "elpis". Usually, this word is translated into English as "Hope", but it could be translated differently. "Expectation" is another possible translation, which is more neutral. One can expect good things, as well as bad things. Hope has a positive connotation.
"Elpis" is everything that remains in the jar, when Pandora closed it again, so does the jar give "elpis" to mankind, or does it keep elpis away from it? -Another question to ask is wheter elpis remaining in the jar a good thing, or a bad one, for mankind?
The first question might confuse the non-specialist. But as with most ancient Greek words, "elpis" can be translated a number of ways. A number of scholars prefer the neutral translation of "expectation." But expectation of what? Classical authors use the word "elpis" to mean "expectation of bad," as well as "expectation of good." Statistical analysis demonstrates that the latter sense appears five times more than the former in all of ancient Greek literature. Others hold the minority view that "elpis" should be rendered, "expectation of evil" ("vel sim").
How one answers the first question largely depends on the answer to the second question: should we interpret the jar to function as a prison, or a pantry? The jar certainly serves as a prison for the evils that Pandora released – they only affect mankind once outside the jar. Some have argued that logic dictates, therefore, that the jar acts as a prison for "Elpis" as well, withholding it from men. If one takes "elpis" to mean expectant hope, then the myth's tone is pessimistic: All the evils in the world were scattered from Pandora's jar, while the one potentially mitigating force, Hope, remains locked securely inside.
This interpretation raises yet another question, complicating the debate: are we to take Hope in an absolute sense, or in a narrow sense where we understand Hope to mean hope only as it pertains to the evils released from the jar? If Hope is imprisoned in the jar, does this mean that human existence is utterly hopeless? This is the most pessimistic reading possible for the myth. A less pessimistic interpretation (still pessimistic, to be sure) understands the myth to say: countless evils fled Pandora's jar and plague human existence; the hope that we might be able to master these evils remains imprisoned inside the jar. Life is not hopeless, but each of us is hopelessly human.
It is also argued that hope was simply one of the evils in the jar, the false kind of hope, and was no good for mankind, since, later in the poem, Hesiod writes that hope is empty (498) and no good (500) and makes mankind lazy by taking away his industriousness, making him prone to evil.
In "Human, All Too Human", philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche argued that "Zeus did not want man to throw his life away, no matter how much the other evils might torment him, but rather to go on letting himself be tormented anew. To that end, he gives man hope. In truth, it is the most evil of evils because it prolongs man's torment."
An objection to the "hope is good/the jar is a prison" interpretation counters that, if the jar is full of evils, then what is expectant hope – a blessing – doing among them? This objection leads some to render "elpis" as the expectation of evil, which would make the myth's tone somewhat optimistic: although humankind is troubled by all the evils in the world, at least we are spared the continual expectation of evil, which would make life unbearable.
The optimistic reading of the myth is expressed by M. L. West. "Elpis" takes the more common meaning of expectant hope. And while the jar served as a prison for the evils that escaped, it thereafter serves as a residence for Hope. West explains, "It would be absurd to represent either the presence of ills by their confinement in a jar or the presence of hope by its escape from one." Hope is thus preserved as a benefit for humans.
An incorrect etymology of Pandora's name, "all-gifted", was provided in "Works and Days". Pandora means "all-giving", but not "all-gifted." Some paintings in vases, from the fifth century before Christ, indicate that the beliefs about the goddess Pandora lasted after the time of Hesiod. Another name of Pandora was found in a kylix (circa 460 BC), "Anesidora", that means "she who sends up gifts." This vase painting depicts Hephaestus and Athenae finishing the touches on the first woman, like in the "Theogony". The epithet "anesidora" is also used to name Gaia or Demeter.
Pandora/Anesidora possibly would have taken on aspects of Gaea and Demeter. Pandora would incarnate the fertility of the Earth and its capacity to bear grain and fruits for the benefit of the Humans. Over time this "all-giving" goddess somehow devolved into an "all-gifted" mortal woman. T. A. Sinclair, commenting on "Works and Days" argues that Hesiod shows no awareness of the mythology of such a divine "giver". A.H. Smith, however, notes that in Hesiod's account Athena and the Seasons brought wreaths of grass and spring flowers to Pandora, indicating that Hesiod was conscious of Pandora's original "all-giving" function. Jane Ellen Harrison sees in Hesiod's story "evidence of a shift from matriarchy to patriarchy in Greek culture. As the life-bringing goddess Pandora is eclipsed, the death-bringing human Pandora arises." Thus Harrison concludes "in the patriarchal mythology of Hesiod her great figure is strangely changed and diminished. She is no longer Earth-Born, but the creature, the handiwork of Olympian Zeus." (Harrison 1922:284) Robert Graves, quoting Harrison, asserts of the Hesiodic episode that "Pandora is not a genuine myth, but an anti-feminist fable, probably of his own invention." H.J.Rose wrote that the myth of Pandora is decidedly more illiberal than that of epic in that it makes Pandora the origin of all of Man's woes with her being the exemplification of the bad wife.
The Hesiodic myth did not, however, completely obliterate the memory of the all-giving goddess Pandora. A scholium to line 971 of Aristophanes' "The Birds" mentions a cult "to Pandora, the earth, because she bestows all things necessary for life".
In fifth-century Athens Pandora made a prominent appearance in what, at first, appears an unexpected context, in a marble relief or bronze appliqués as a frieze along the base of the "Athena Parthenos" the culminating experience on the Acropolis; there Jeffrey M. Hurwit has interpreted her presence as an "anti-Athena" reinforcing civic ideologies of patriarchy and the "highly gendered social and political realities of fifth-century Athens." Interpretation has never come easy: Pausanias (i.24.7) merely noted the subject and moved on. Jeffrey Hurwit has argued that Pandora represents an "anti-Athena", similarly a child of no mother, an embodiment of the need for the patriarchal rule that the virginal Athena, rising above her sex, defended.
The humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam translated Hesiod from Greek to Latin, in the 16th century. The Greek word "pithos" is used for a large jar, used for example for storing wine. It can also refer to a funerary jar. "Pyxis", on the other hand, is a box. Usually, it is said that Erasmus swapped the words when he translated, so Pandora's "jar" became Pandora's box. The phrase "Pandora's box" has endured ever since.

Corpus callosum

The corpus callosum is part of the brain in humans and other eutherian mammals. It is the largest connective pathway in the brain. Its over 200 million nerve fibers connect the left and right hemispheres of the brain. 
The corpus callosum relates to the lateralization of brain function. Because the two side of the brian communicate so intensively, they can afford to specialise in doing somewhat different things.
The corpus callosum is found only in placental mammals (the eutherians). It is absent in monotremes and marsupials, and other vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. 
Other groups do have brain structures that allow for communication between the two hemispheres. The anterior commissure serves as the main cross-hemisphere communication in marsupials. 
The fibrous bundle of the corpus callosum increases to such an extent in humans that it wedges apart the hippocampal structures.

<doc id="166297" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166297" title="Quicksand">
Quicksand

Quicksand is a mixture of water and sand or silt. It has the characteristic of thixotropy: it looks solid, but when pressure is applied it liquifies (acts like a liquid). If animals or people stand on it, they sink into it. However, a person does not drown in quicksand. A human or animal does not sink entirely into quicksand due to the higher density of the fluid. It can be difficult to get out: that is the real problem. Quicksand may be escaped by slow movement of the legs in order to reduce viscosity of the fluid, and rotating the body so as to float on one's back (supine).
Water circulation underground can focus in an area with just the right mixture of fine sands and other materials such as clay. The water moves up and then down slowly in a convection-like manner throughout a column of sand, and the sand remains a generally solid mass. This lubricates the sand particles and makes them unable to support any significant weight, since they move around with very little friction. They behave more like a liquid when exposed to stress. Since the water does not usually go all the way up through the sand, the sand above does not appear to move at all, and can support leaves and other small debris. This makes it difficult to distinguish quicksand from the surrounding environment. 
Quicksand is a non-Newtonian fluid: when undisturbed it often seems to be solid ("gel" form), but a small (less than 1%) change in the stress on the quicksand causes it to turn liquid ("sol" form). There is a sudden decrease in its viscosity. Under his weight, the person then sinks into the sol (liquidised sand).
Someone stepping in it starts to sink. Around the person dense regions of sand and sediment form and grip the person. The viscosity of the quicksand seems to increase suddenly. It is now a gel. In order to move within the quicksand, a person or object must apply sufficient pressure on the compacted sand to re-introduce enough water to liquify it. The forces required to do this are quite large: to remove a foot from quicksand at a speed of one centimeter per second would require the same amount of force as "that needed to lift a medium-sized car".
It was commonly believed that the behavior of quicksand was due solely to saturated or supersaturated suspensions of granules in water. Pressure from underground sources of water would separate and suspend the granular particles, reducing the friction between them. In 2005 it was been shown that the presence of salt is important. The stability of the colloidal quicksand is changed by the presence of salt. It increases the high viscosity regions of sediment responsible for quicksand's "trapping" power. Another finding was that a human cannot be drawn into a saltwater quicksand entirely.
Quicksand may be found inland (on riverbanks, near lakes, or in marshes), or near the coast.
One region notorious for its quicksands is Morecambe Bay, Yorkshire. As the bay is very broad and shallow, a person trapped by the quicksand would be exposed to the danger of the returning tide, which can come in rapidly.

In some countries paramilitary forces are included in a nation's armed forces. Armed forces that are not a part of the military or paramilitary organizations, such as insurgent forces, often mimic military organizations, or use ad hoc structures.

SS-Verfügungstruppe

The SS-Verfügungstruppe (The Combat Support Force) (short: SS-VT) were combat divisions of the SS, trained to the same way as the normal German Armed Forces (Wehrmacht). They were the precursor of the later-developed Waffen-SS.
On 24 September 1934, a special SS military unit was made up by a group of a few other Nazi and paramilitary units like units known as SS Special Detachments (SS-Sonderkommandos) and the Guard known as the (SS-Stabswache) units. The new group was to be trained as combat ready infantry. The unit was called SS-Special Purpose Troops (SS-Verfügungstruppe) and was not the police or the Armed Forces but military trained men for the use by the Führer in war or peace. The SS-Verfügungstruppe (known as SS-VT) was told to the public on 16 March 1935. The SS-VT trained with Hitler’s body guards some of which later joined the SS-VT prior to the invasion of Russia in 1941
Some units of the SS-VT worked with the Wehrmacht during the take over of the Sudetenland, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, and took part in the invasion of Poland along with the campaign against the Allies in the West. From the regiments that made up the SS-VT came the Waffen-SS (or "Armed"-SS) Divisions that fought in all German theaters in World War II. Units making up the SS-VT were not known as the "Waffen-SS" until a speech by Adolf Hitler in July 1940.
In 1939 the whole SS was split into two groups: the Allgemeine-SS (the General SS) and the Waffen-SS (the Armed SS).
The Waffen-SS was made up of three smaller groups
In 1941 the commander of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, said that more Waffen-SS Verfügungstruppe units would be made from non-German foreign nationals. The goal was to get more soldiers from occupied nations. Some of these foreign units included volunteers from Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway, and the Netherlands.
Countries like Spain, officially a neutral state, had by the end of the war given many volunteers to the Waffen SS (most of them with the SS Wallonien division) that took part in combat until the end of the European war in Berlin. This and many other volunteers of non-German background were believers in the German cause.

A detachment (from the French word "détachement") is a military unit. It can be broken off from a bigger unit for a set reason or (as often seen in United States Army usage) can be a permanent unit smaller than a battalion. The term is often used to refer to a unit that is sent to a different base from the parent unit. 
A Cadet detachment usually consists of between 10 and 40 cadets. Several detachments make up a cadet company.

1984 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1984 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1984 and ended on November 30, 1984. Sometimes storms form outside these dates for example. An example of this is Hurricane Lili, which formed on December 12. Lili lasted until December 24.
This season was active, with 17 depression, 13 of them became a tropical storm, 5 of the tropical storms became hurricanes, and 1 of the hurricanes became a major hurricane. Most of the cyclones were weak. The only very damaging storm was Hurricane Diana. Diana was the major hurricane of the season, and the only storm to affect land as a hurricane.

Kenyanthropus platyops

Kenyanthropus platyops is an extinct hominid species discovered in Lake Turkana, Kenya in 1999. It was by Justus Erus, who was part of Meave Leakey's team. 
The fossil 3.5 to 3.2 million year old. It has a broad flat face with a toe bone that suggests it probably walked upright. Teeth are intermediate between typical human and typical ape forms.
Leakey proposed that the fossil represents an entirely new hominine genus. Others classify it as a separate species of "Australopithecus", Australopithecus platyops, and still others interpret it as an individual of "Australopithecus afarensis".
If some palaeoanthropologists are correct, "Kenyanthropus" may not even represent a valid taxon. The specimen is so distorted by matrix-filled cracks that meaningful morphological characteristics are next to impossible to assess with confidence.

Combot

Combot is a character made for the "Tekken" series. Its first and only appearance was in "Tekken 4".
Combot is Mokujin's replacement in Tekken 4 (gameplay wise). Combot didn't mimic a different character every round like Mokujin, instead it changed fighting styles every match.
Combot is a humanoid robot (a robot that was made to act like humans). Lee entered it in the King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 and he used it so he could win. He entered the tournament himself, disguising himself as a man named Violet
Combot is not like any other humanoid robot. A powerful AI function lets it mimic any human motion it can see. With this ability, Combot can do any job from childcare, housekeeping, service industries, and even military duty. 
This Combot is a unique version made for fighting. The making of Combot was very rushed so that it could be finished in time for The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4. 
Lee Chaolan’s plan was to have Combot memorize different of fighting styles as it went through the tournament. Lee was trying to create the most powerful fighting robot in the world and win the Mishima Zaibatsu at the same time. 
The development team did not have enough time to get rid of Combot's problems. As a result, a few bugs remained in its memory when the Tournament started. These bugs stop Combot from mimicking more than one person’s moves each time it starts up.

Disk buffer

A disk buffer is a small amount of memory on a hard drive. Sometimes it is also called cache buffer, or disk cache, but these words should not be used, a disk buffer is not a cache. In early 2015, hard disks usually have between 16 and 128 megabytes of such memory.
When writing data to the disk, the data needs to be written to a certain position on the disk. This is done by a component called disk read/write head. This head needs to be moved to (or near) the correct track. After some settling time the read head begins to pick up bits. Usually, the first sectors to be read are not the ones that have been requested by the operating system. The disk's embedded computer typically saves these unrequested sectors in the disk buffer, in case the operating system requests them later.
The disk is attached to the computer by what is called an I/O interface. This interface almost always works at a different speed than that of the hard disk platter. In such a case, the disk buffer is used to store the data that comes from the disk, before it sent to the computer, or to store the data that comes from the computer before it can be written to the disk.
Modern disks often have a feature called "command queuing" (This is called TCQ in SCSI disks, and NCQ in SATA disks). This means that many commands can be sent at the same time, and the hard disk will put them into the best order. To store the commands and re-order them, the hard disk needs the disk buffer

Pirna is a "Große Kreisstadt" in the rural district of Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge in the Free State of Saxony, Germany.
Pirna is located at the beginn of the Elbtalkessel, where the Wesenitz and the Gottleuba flow in the Elbe. In the south of Pirna is the "Osterzgebirge". Pirna is named "Tor zur Sächsischen Schweiz" (door to the Sächsische Schweiz).
Direct in the north of Pirna is the capital of Saxony, Dresden. Nearby towns are Bad Gottleuba-Berggießhübel, Bahretal, Dohma, Dohna, Dürrröhrsdorf-Dittersbach, Heidenau, Lohmen, Stadt Wehlen and Struppen. All these towns are in the rural districts of Sächsische and Schweiz-Osterzgebirge.
The first relics of human settlers are from the last ice age. In the neolithic age farmers lived in this region. In the 6th century the Sorbs settled in Pirna.
With the foundation of the "Mark Meißen" in the 10th century it was possible to re-prove a settlement in the area of Pirna. In the 12th century the castle of Prina would be built. Henry III, Margrave of Meissen gave the townrights to Pirna. The Elbe was in this time an important river for the trade. In 1233 the town was first mentioned in a document. Wenceslaus II of Bohemia bought the town in 1293 and so the town was Bohemian until 1405. In 1307 a convent was founded.
The table below lists the population change of Pirna since 1300. Since 1960 the population was counted on December 31 every year.

Gavotte

The gavotte was a folk dance, performed by the peasants in the Brittany region of France. Later it was popular in French and English courts in the 17th and 18th centuries. It was especially popular in the French courts of King Louis XIV. 
The music for a gavotte has a four beat feel, with upbeats on beats three and four. To dance a gavotte the dancers must cross their feet twice in each step pattern, with each step followed by a hop. Singers often provided the accompaniment, though dancers might also be accompanied by an ensemble of such instruments as a violin, a drum, bagpipes or shawm, a forerunner of the modern oboe.
The gavotte later became a musical, rather than a dance piece. In the Baroque period gavottes were mainly found in binary form. When composers began writing suites, six short dance based pieces, the gavotte usually was played between the sarabande and the gigue. The best known examples of the gavotte are found in the suites and partitas written by J.S.Bach.

A quartz clock is a clock that uses an electronic oscillator that is regulated by a quartz crystal to keep time. This crystal oscillator creates a signal with very precise frequency, so that quartz clocks are at least an order of magnitude more accurate than good mechanical clocks. Generally, some form of digital logic counts the cycles of this signal and provides a numeric time display, usually in units of hours, minutes, and seconds. Since the 1970s, they have become the most widely used timekeeping technology.

Homo sapiens idaltu

Homo sapiens idaltu is an extinct subspecies of "Homo sapiens". They lived almost 160,000 years ago in Africa during the Pleistocene period. "" is the Afar word for "elder, first born".
The fossilized remains of "H. s. idaltu" were discovered in Ethiopia's Afar Triangle in 1997. The region has volcanic layers. By using radiometric dating, the layers date between 154,000 and 160,000 years old. Three well preserved crania (top part of skulls) were discovered, the best preserved being from an adult male (BOU-VP-16/1) with a brain capacity of . 
Later, another even earlier version of "Homo sapiens" was found by a team led by Richard Leakey. These remains were from Omo National Park, Ethiopia. A 2005 potassium-argon dating of volcanic tuff associated with the remains showed them to date from about 195,000 years ago, even older than the "idaltu" fossils. These Omo remains are the earliest known remains of anatomically modern humans. Leakey and his team have not given the remains a subspecific name. They are just called "Omo remains of "Homo sapiens"".

Blue-green

Blue-green is a color that is a deep tone of cyan.
On the older red-yellow-blue pigment color wheel (in which red, yellow and blue were called the primary colors and orange, green, and violet were called the secondary colors), "blue-green" was a third color between blue and green. The other third colors on a red-yellow-blue (RYB) color wheel were called red-violet, blue-violet, yellow-green, yellow-orange and red-orange.

EJB QL

EJB QL or EJB-QL is a portable database query language for Enterprise Java Beans. It can run on any database. It is used in J2EE applications. It is more complex but less powerful than SQL.
The language has been inspired by the native Hibernate Query Language HQL.
EJB QL is a database query language similar like SQL. The used queries are somewhat different from relational SQL. It uses a so-called "abstract schema" of the enterprise beans, not the relational model. In other words, EJB QL queries do not use tables and their components. They use enterprise beans, their persistent state, and their relationships. The result of an SQL query is a set of rows with a fixed number of columns. The result of an EJB QL query is either a single object, a collection of entity objects of a given type, or a collection of values retrieved from CMP fields. One has to understand the data model of enterprise beans in order to write effective queries.

Habitable zone

A habitable zone (HZ) in astronomy is a region of space where conditions are best for life to form as on Earth. Planets in these areas are the most likely to have extraterrestrial life.
The habitable zone may also be called the "life zone", "comfort zone", "green belt" or "Goldilocks zone". One in five stars has an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone. However, it is not known what proportion would have conditions suitable for life.
The Goldilocks principle or 'Goldilocks effect' is that something must be within limits: "not too hot, not too cold, but just right". 
It is taken from a children's story "The Three Bears" in which a little girl named Goldilocks finds a house owned by three bears. Each bear has their own preference of food, beds, etc. After testing each of the three items, Goldilocks determines that one of them is always too much in one extreme (too hot, too large, etc.), one is too much in the opposite extreme (too cold, too small, etc.), and one is "just right".
In astrobiology, the Goldilocks zone refers to the habitable zone around a star. A planet must neither be too far away from, nor too close to a star and galactic centre to support life. Either extreme would prevent a planet evolving life. 
Such a planet is colloquially called a "Goldilocks planet".
In a solar system, astronomers believe a planet must be in the habitable zone to have life. The circumstellar habitable zone is an area around a star where a planet would be able to have liquid water. Liquid water may be necessary for all forms of life. 
Bigger stars are generally hotter, so the circumstellar habitable zone would be farther away from the star than for the Sun. Smaller stars are cooler, so the circumstellar habitable zone would be closer to the star than for the Sun. The size and brightness of a star determine where the circumstellar habitable zone is found around the star.
Planets are evaluated on these seven criteria:
This concept is not so widely used. It is the idea that a solar system must also be in a suitable place inside a galaxy for life to form.
Some areas of galaxies are better suited to life than others. The Solar System in which we live, in the Orion Spur, on the Milky Way galaxy's edge is a life-favorable spot, since we are there.
The habitable zone is the region around a star where a planet has sufficient atmospheric pressure to keep liquid water on its surface.
A "habitable planet candidate" implies a terrestrial planet within the zone, and with conditions roughly comparable to those of the Earth (i.e. an Earth analog) and thus potentially favourable to life. 
Only about a dozen planets have been confirmed in the habitable zone, but the Kepler spacecraft has identified a further 54 candidates. Estimates sugest that there are "at least 500 million" such planets in the Milky Way.

<doc id="166559" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166559" title="Ernst Röhm">
Ernst Röhm

Ernst Julius Röhm (28 November 1887 in Munich – 1 July 1934 in Munich) was a leader and co-founder of the German Sturmabteilung, the Stormtroopers. He also was a member of the German Reichstag, where he was a minister from 1933 to 1934. He was murdered during the Night of the Long Knives, in 1934. Adolf Hitler gave the order to murder Röhm. During the First World War, he was awarded the Iron Cross First Class.
Hitler had known of his homosexuality since 1919 and this probably was one of the reasons that Röhm was murdered.
Ernst Röhm was born in Munich on 28 November 1887. He was the third child of a chief train inspector, Julius Röhm, and his wife, Emilie Röhm. He had one older brother and one older sister. His sister's son was Bernhard Lippert, a German diplomat.
In 1906, after his Abitur (school exams) in Munich, Röhm joined the Bavarian army as a Fanjunkare. Two years later he became a Lieutenant.
In 1914, at the beginning of the First World War, he was an adjutant and fought on the Western Front. He was wounded three times, and was awarded the Iron Cross First Class. He was badly hurt in that year and lost a piece of his nasal bone. He worked for the Bavarian government in the War Department for the first time. Two years later, in 1918, he was given the rank of a captain (German: "Hauptmann").
After the First World War, Röhm went to the Freikorps (Free Corps) of Franz Ritter von Epp. He wanted to fight against the Communists in Munich. With this group, he went to fight against the Bavarian Soviet Republic. In July 1919, the Freikorps became part of the Reichswehr.
In 1919, Röhm joined the German Workers' Party (German: "Deutsche Arbeiter Partei (DAP)"). This was the precursor of the Nazi party. One year later, he became a member of the German Nazi Party. He received the membership number 623. Röhm helped Hitler establish relationships with the Bavarian politicians and the industrialists. Two years later, Röhm and Hitler started the Sturmabteilung (SA), attracting many men from the Freikorps. It was founded as a paramilitary group for the German Nazi Party. Hitler made Röhm the leader of the SA.
Röhm took a part in the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. The Nazi Party tried to overthrow the government, but failed. Röhm was arrested and charged with high treason. The judges decided he was guilty on 1 April 1924. Röhm went to prison for five months and lost his job in the army. Following the court trial, both the Nazi Party and the Sturmabteilung became illegal.
In 1924, Röhm helped start the "Frontbann", an alternative to the Sturmabteilung. After an argument with Adolf Hitler, Röhm retired as leader of the SA. He said that he was only a soldier and not a politician. Between 1928 and 1930, he worked for the Bolivian military as an advisor.
On 1 November 1930, he went back to Germany and joined the Nazi Party a second time. In January 1931, Adolf Hitler placed Röhm in charge of the Sturmabteilung. In just over a year, he expanded it from 70,000 to 170,000 members. In April 1932, Chancellor Heinrich Brüning banned the SA again. Franz von Papen, who was chancellor after Heinrich Brüning, annulled the ban in June. In 1933, Ernst Röhm became a "Reichsminister", a minister of the Reichstag. In 1934, the SA had over 4,500,000 members. The power of the SA increased. Because of this, Adolf Hitler and the Schutzstaffel (SS) started a new dispute with Röhm. The SA was about 20 times greater in membership than the "Reichswehr"; Röhm was dreaming to take over the "Reichswehr".
Hitler was afraid of Röhm's power. Röhm wanted to merge the Sturmabteilung with the general army, with him as leader. He also wanted a "second Nazi revolution" to make Germany more socialist. He was an anticapitalist, and at this time, Hitler was trying to befriend Germany's industrialists. Hitler planned to kill Röhm.
Röhm arranged with Hitler that the Sturmabteilung would get four weeks holiday during the summer of 1934. The holiday started on 1 July 1934. Röhm wanted to go to Bad Wiessee for rest. On 29 June 1934, Röhm was arrested, yet had no trial. He was given the choice by Theodor Eicke: to commit suicide or be killed. On 1 July, Theodor Eicke shot Röhm as instructed by Hitler. Röhm was buried in the Munich western cemetery.
Many Sturmabteilung leaders were killed on that same night. It was called the "Night of the Long Knives". The next day the German parliament passed a law with only one paragraph making the murders at the Night of the Long Knives legal.
Röhm is well known in Germany and by historians for his homosexuality. He wrote three letters in Bolivia to a German doctor where he wrote about his homosexuality. Röhm said that he discovered his homosexuality first in 1924. In the mid-1920s, he started to communicate with the gay community in Berlin and Munich. Hitler knew of Röhm's homosexuality for many years but said he had heard it for the first time in 1934. Hitler lied because homosexuality was against the ideology of the Nazi party.

Feud

A feud () (also called blood feud or vendetta) is a long-running argument or fight between parties. In most cases it involves whole familles or clans. People are seen as guilty, not because they did something, but because they were seen with other people (who are considered guilty). This is called guilt by association.
Feuds start because one party thinks they were attacked, insulted, or otherwise harmed by the other party. Intense feelings of resentment trigger the initial revenge, which causes the other party to feel the same way. The dispute is then fueled by a long-running cycle of retaliatory violence. This ongoing cycle of provocation and retaliation makes it very difficult to end the feud peacefully. Feuds frequently involve the original parties' family members and/or associates. They can last for generations.
Up to the early modern period, feuds were considered legitimate legal instruments. The state or ruler even made laws for certain aspects of feuds. Once modern centralizing states asserted and enforced a monopoly on legitimate use of force, feuds became illegal and the concept acquired its current negative connotation.
A blood feud is a feud with a cycle of retaliatory violence, with the relatives of someone who has been killed or otherwise wronged or dishonored. The wronged person then wants vengeance and kills the culprits or punishes them in other ways. If he cannot get the culprits, he does this to their relatives. Historically, the word vendetta has been used to mean a blood feud. The word is Italian, and originates from the Latin "vindicta", "vengeance." In modern times, the word also means any other long-standing feud, not necessarily involving bloodshed.
Originally, a vendetta was a blood feud between two families. Kinsmen of the victim wanted to take revenge for his or her death by killing either those responsible for the killing or some of their relatives. Usually, the closest male relative of the person killed or wronged maintains the vendetta, but other members of the family may do so as well. If the culprit had disappeared or was already dead, the vengeance could extend to other relatives.
Vendetta is typical of societies with a weak rule of law or in those where the state does not consider itself responsible for helping with this kind of dispute. In such societies, family and kinship ties are the main source of authority. An entire family is considered responsible for whatever one of them has done. Sometimes even two separate branches of the same family could come to blows over some matter.
Today, the practice of vendetta has almost disappeared in societies where law enforcement works. There, criminal law punishes lawbreakers.
In ancient Homeric Greece, the practice of personal vengeance against wrongdoers was considered natural and customary: "Embedded in the Greek morality of retaliation is the right of vendetta . . . Vendetta is a war, just as war is an indefinite series of vendettas; and such acts of vengeance are sanctioned by the gods".
The Ancient Hebrew tribes considered it to be the duty of the individual and family to avenge evil in God's name. The person who put the initial aggressive killer to death was given a special name: "go'el haddam", the blood-avenger or blood-redeemer (Num. 35: 19, etc.). Six cities of refuge were made to provide a "cooling off" phase as well as due process for the accused. As the "Oxford Companion to the Bible" states: "Since life was viewed as sacred (Gen. 9.6), no amount of blood money could be given as recompense for the loss of the life of an innocent person; it had to be 'life for life'" (Exod. 21.23; Deut. 19.21)".
According to medievalist Marc Bloch, "The Middle Ages, from beginning to end, and particularly the feudal era, lived under the sign of private vengeance. The onus, of course, lay above all on the wronged individual; vengeance was imposed on him as the most sacred of duties ... The solitary individual, however, could do but little. Moreover, it was most commonly a death that had to be avenged. In this case the family group went into action and the "faide" (feud) came into being, to use the old Germanic word which spread little by little through the whole of Europe--'the vengeance of the kinsmen which we call "faida"', as a German canonist expressed it. No moral obligation seemed more sacred than this ... The whole kindred, therefore, placed as a rule under the command of a chieftain, took up arms to punish the murder of one of its members or merely a wrong that he had suffered" (Marc Bloch, trans. L. A. Manyon, "Feudal Society", Vol. I, 1965, p. 125-126).
The Celtic phenomenon of the "blood feud" demanded "an eye for an eye," and usually descended into murder. Disagreements between clans might last for generations in Scotland and Ireland. Due to the Celtic heritage of many whites living in Appalachia, a series of prolonged violent engagements in late- nineteenth-century Kentucky and West Virginia were referred to commonly as feuds, a tendency that was partly due to the nineteenth-century popularity of William Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott, authors who both wrote semihistorical accounts of blood feuds. These incidents, the most famous of which was the Hatfield-McCoy feud, were regularly featured in the newspapers of the eastern U.S. between the 1880s and the early twentieth century. Although they were interpreted as such at the time, there is little reason to believe that these American incidents had any correlation to "feuding" in Europe centuries earlier.
Chariot racing in the Byzantine Empire also included the racing clubs. The Blues and the Greens were more than simply sports teams. They gained influence in military, political, and theological matters. The Blue-Green rivalry often erupted into gang warfare, and street violence had been on the rise in the reign of Justin I. Riots culminated in the Nika riots of 532 AD during the reign of Justinian I, with nearly half the city being burned or destroyed and tens of thousands of people killed.
The Central Asian plateau (north of China) at the time of Genghis Khan's youth was divided into several nomadic tribes or confederations—among them Naimans, Merkits, Uyghurs, Tatars, Mongols, and Keraits—that were all prominent in their own right and often unfriendly toward each other, as evidenced by frequent raids, revenges, and plundering.
In Japan's feudal past the Samurai class upheld the honor of their family, clan, or their lord by "katakiuchi" (), or revenge killings. These killings could also involve the relatives of an offender. While some vendettas were punished by the government, such as that of the 47 Ronin, others were given official permission with specific targets.
At the Holy Roman Empire's "Reichstag" at Worms in 1495 the right of waging feuds was abolished. The Imperial Reform proclaimed an "eternal public peace" ("Ewiger Landfriede") to put an end to the abounding feuds and the anarchy of the robber barons and it defined a new standing imperial army to enforce that peace. However, it took a few more decades until the new regulation was universally accepted. In 1506, for example, knight Jan Kopidlansky killed somebody in Prague and the Town Councillors sentenced him to death and had him executed. Brother Jiri Kopidlansky revenged himself by continuing atrocities.
More than a third of the Ya̧nomamö males, on average, died from warfare. The accounts of missionaries to the area have recounted constant infighting in the tribes for women or prestige, and evidence of continuous warfare for the enslavement of neighboring tribes such as the Macu before the arrival of European settlers and government.
The Clan Gordon was at one point one of the most powerful clans in middle Scotland. Clan feuds and battles were frequent, especially with the Clan Cameron, Clan Murray, Clan Forbes, and the Chattan Confederation.
In Corsica, vendetta was a social code that required Corsicans to kill anyone who wronged the family honor. It has been estimated that between 1683 and 1715, nearly 30,000 out of 120,000 Corsicans lost their lives to vendetta.
Throughout history, the Maniots—one of Greece's toughest populations—have been known by their neighbors and their enemies as fearless warriors who practice blood feuds. Some vendettas went on for months and sometimes years. The families involved would lock themselves in their towers and when they got the chance would murder members of the opposing family.
The Basque Country in the Late Middle Ages was ravaged by bitter partisan wars between local ruling families. In Navarre, these conflicts became polarised in a violent struggle between the Agramont and Beaumont parties. In Biscay, the two major warring factions were named Oinaz and Gamboa. ("Cf." the Guelphs and Ghibellines in Italy). High defensive structures ("towers") built by local noble families, few of which survive today, were frequently razed by fires, sometimes by royal decree.
Leontiy Lyulye, an expert on conditions in the Caucasus, wrote in the mid-19th century: "Among the mountain people the blood feud is not an uncontrollable permanent feeling such as the vendetta is among the Corsicans. It is more like an obligation imposed by the public opinion." In the Dagestani aul Kadar, one such blood feud between two antagonistic clans lasted for nearly 260 years, from the 17th century till the 1860s.
An alternative to feud was "blood money" (or "weregild" in the Norse culture), which demanded payment of some kind from those responsible for a wrongful death (even an accidental one). If these payments were not made or were refused by the offended party, a blood feud would ensue.
Vendetta is reputedly still practiced in some areas in France (especially Corsica) and Italy (especially Sicily, Sardinia, Campania, Calabria, Apulia, and other areas of Southern Italy), in Crete (Greece), among Kurdish clans in Iraq and Turkey, in northern Albania, among Pashtuns in Afghanistan, among Somali clans, over land in Nigeria, in India (a caste-related feuds among rival Hindu groups), between rival tribes in the north-east Indian state of Assam, among rival clans in China and Philippines, among the Arab Bedouins and Arab tribes inhabiting the mountains of Yemen and between Shiites and Sunnis in Iraq, in southern Ethiopia, among the highland tribes of New Guinea, in Svaneti, in the mountainous areas of Dagestan, many northern areas of Georgia and Azerbaijan, a number of republics of the northern Caucasus and essentially among Chechen teips where those seeking retribution do not accept or respect the local law enforcement authority. Vendettas are generally abetted by a perceived or actual indifference on behalf of local law enforcement. 
In Albania, the blood feud has returned in rural areas after more than 40 years of being abolished by Albanian communists led by Enver Hoxha. More than 5,500 Albanian families are currently engaged in blood feuds. There are now more than 20,000 men and boys who live under an ever-present death sentence because of blood feuds. Since 1992, at least 10,000 Albanians have been killed due to blood feuds.
Mutual vendetta may develop into a vicious circle of further killings, retaliation, counterattacks, and all-out warfare that can end in the mutual extinction of both families. Often the original cause is forgotten, and feuds continue simply because it is perceived that there has always been a feud.
There is a scene in "The Godfather," in which Michael Corleone, hiding from U.S. police in Sicily, walks through a village with his two bodyguards. Michael asks, "Where are all the men?" The bodyguard replies, "They're all dead from vendettas."
Some of the gang wars between organized crime groups are effectively forms of vendetta, where the criminal organization (like the Mafia "family") has taken the place of blood relatives.

Keymer

Keymer is a village in West Sussex, England. It can be found on the B2116 road 2.4 miles south of Burgess Hill.
Keymer used to be a village on its own until it was merged into the modern day village of Hassocks. Keymer's records go back as far as The Domesday Book. Keymer is situated just to the east of Hassocks and is only a matter of a few hundred yards from the boundary with East Sussex. It has a fine parish church unusually called St Cosmas and St Damian Church. The oldest part of Keymer can be found in the area of this church and the Greyhound Pub. 
To the north-east of Keymer can be found Oldland Mill dating from the 17th Century. It is one of the few remaining windmills still standing in the south-east. The new burial ground that is now run by Hassocks Parish Council can be found located to the east of the Greyhound Pub.

Empty set

In mathematics, the empty set is the set that has no things in it. For example, consider the set of integer numbers between two and three. Since there are no integer numbers between two and three, the set of integer numbers between them is "empty".
Any statement about all elements of the empty set is considered true. For example, all integers between two and three are greater then seven. This only makes sense because there are no integers between two and three.

2009 Victorian bushfires

The 2009 Victorian bushfires also called Black Saturday, were more than 400 bushfires that started in Victoria, Australia on February 7, 2009. The fires caused Australia's highest ever loss of life from a bushfire. Police say that 173 people died, and 100 people were taken to hospitals with bad burns. At first the death toll was thought to be 210, but forensic tests have shown there were only 173 people killed.
The fires burnt down at least 2,029 homes, 3,500 buildings in total and damaged thousands more. Many towns north-east of the state capital Melbourne were badly damaged or almost completely destroyed, including the Victorian towns of Kinglake, Marysville, Narbethong, Strathewen, and Flowerdale. Many houses in the Victorian towns of Steels Creek, Humevale, Wandong, St Andrews, Callignee, and Koornalla were also destroyed or damaged. There were people killed at each town. The fires affected 78 towns and left about 7,500 people homeless. More than 4,000 firemen and women worked to control and stop the fires. They were still burning more than two weeks after they started.
Most of the fires started and spread on a day of some of the worst bushfire weather ever recorded. The temperature in Victoria reached 46 degrees Celsius and wind speed was more than 100 km/h. The wind blew the fires over large distances and areas, creating large firestorms. North-east of Melbourne, a single firestorm killed 120 people. A cool change hit the state in the early evening, but it had gale force south-westerly winds of more than 120 km/h. This change in wind direction caused the long eastern sides of the fires to become wide fire fronts that burned with quickly towards towns that had earlier escaped the fires.
Many of the fires were started by fallen or clashing power lines or were deliberately lit. There was also lightning, cigarette butts, and sparks from a power tool. A ten-year drought made the land and forests very dry and they burnt hi quickly. Finally, in early-mid March, the weather changed and the fire fighters were able to put out the fires.
Starting at the end of January, south east Australia had days of very hot weather, called a heatwave. The heatwave was caused by a slow moving high-pressure system over the Tasman Sea, a big Tropical Cyclone off the north west Australian coast, and a monsoon trough over northern Australia. This caused hot tropical air to travel down over south eastern Australia.
The February fires started on the hottest day ever in Victoria, where temperature records have been kept since 1859. On 6 February 2009 – the day before the fires - Premier of Victoria John Brumby told people that very hot weather was coming, and that there was a big danger of bushfires. He told people to be very careful. Premier Brumby also said that it would be the "worst day of fire conditions in the history of the state".
At the end of January, there were fires in the Gippsland area of Victoria. These included a small trees fire near Delburn, Victoria and one which nearly burnt a pine tree plantation.
There were two small grass fires near the city of Sale, Victoria, which were deliberately lit.
On 29 January, over 500 firemen fought the two fires at Delburn which had joined together into one big fire. The fires had burnt near Boolarra and Darlimurra, south of the city of Morwell. No buildings were burnt. A cool change in the weather on 30 January made it easier to fight the fires, but also made it windy, which led to spot fires (new, small fires from burning plants blown ahead). On the evening of 31 January, fire crews worked to stop the fire spreading to the north. They fought to protect the main power transmission lines taking electricity to Melbourne from the Latrobe Valley. The fire was also close to the Hazelwood Power Station, Victoria.
By February 1, firemen had made fire breaks (clear areas) around the Boolarra fire, although it was still burning out of control. The fire had burned through and destroyed 29 houses, farm buildings and animals. Police believed Delburn and Boolarra fires were deliberately lit. They offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of people who lit the fires.
On February 2, lightning started 23 new fires. This included three in the Bunyip State Park, and fires near Drouin West and Leongatha. However, increased humidity helped stop the fires spreading. On February 3, the Country Fire Authority grouped the fires into six areas. Five fires were under control, but one, near Mirboo North, was not.
The major fires include:
The Kinglake fire, was named when two fires joined together after the wind changed direction on February 7 and 8. The fire had burned over by February 8. 147 people died in the Kinglake fire.
The first of the two fires started at Kilmore East, Victoria, on the afternoon February 7 2009, and burned south-east towards St. Andrews through Wandong and Clonbinane. The fire destroyed 30 houses at Wandong and Heathcote Junction on February 7. By February 8, 150 houses had been destroyed at Wandong, and four people killed. The fire closed the Seymour railway line, and parts of the Hume Highway near Kilmore. The north west winds blew the front of the fire towards St Andrews, before the weather changed about 7.30pm, changing the wind to the south west. The wind change turned the long, narrow fire, into a wide fire front that moved north east to Kinglake and Strathewen.
By the evening of February 8, 100 people who had escaped the Kilmore fire, were sheltering in a basketball stadium at Wallan. Many of them were unable to go back to their homes because the police had closed the roads.
The fire front burned through the Kinglake area on February 7. This was the worst fire area in the state, with 37 people killed, and more than 550 houses destroyed. Another 12 people died at Kinglake West, and in Strathewen, 27.
The second fire destroyed the town of Marysville, Victoria. It started north of Marysville, and at first people thought it would go around the town, but within minutes the town was an inferno. At about 5.00pm, electric power was lost, and the wind stopped. Minutes later the wind came back from a different direction, bringing the fire up the valley with it. Damage to the water treatment plant at Marysville made the water unsafe to drink. On February 11, it was said that 100 people of the town's population of 500 were believed to have died, and that only a few buildings were left. Premier Brumby said: "There's no activity, there's no people, there's no buildings, there's no birds, there's no animals, everything's just gone." These numbers were later revised, but 40 people did die, and nearly every building in the town was damaged or destroyed.
About 95% of the houses in Narbethong were destroyed. Other towns affected by the same fire included Taggerty and Buxton.
To the south west, the fire was burning on three sides of Yarra Glen, Victoria, trapping people in the town. Houses north of Yarra Glen were destroyed and large areas of grass lands were burnt.
For some time, the police believed that someone lit the fire that burnt Marysville, and several people were investigated. However, in June 2011, Victoria Police announced that this was probably not the cause.
The Maroondah/Yarra fire was named on February 10, when several fires that had been burning to the east of Healesville, Victoria and Toolangi joined together. By late morning, the fire had burned , with 184 firemen and 56 fire trucks at the fire. While the temperature had cooled, strong winds blew embers and started new fires. Around midday, the danger to property around Healesville was downgraded, though the Department of Sustainability and Environment said that people should watch for changes in the weather.
The fires in the Maroondah/Yarra area continued to threaten the town of Healesville, Victoria until February 14.
In Beechworth, Victoria, a fire burnt more than and came near to the towns of Yackandandah, Stanley, Bruarong, Dederang, Kancoona, Kancoona South, Coralbank, Glen Creek, and Running Creek, Victoria. The fire started at 7.00pm on February 7, south of Beechworth, before being driven south through pine plantations by hot northerly winds.
The fire destroyed buildings at Mudgegonga, Victoria, south east of Beechworth; 2 people died. Thick smoke and clouds made it hard to work out the size of the Beechworth fire.
Strong winds fed the fire on the night of February 8, and lightning started a new fire at Kergunyah around midday on February 9. More than 440 firemen worked to stop a new fire that threatened Gundowring, and Eskdale, Victoria after it jumped the Kiewa River. On the night of February 9, the greatest danger was to Eskdale. Fires were also burning in pine plantations from the large town of Myrtleford, at the opposite, western end of the fire area. While smaller towns to the east, including Gundowring and Kergunyah, were still threatened, the CFA said that there was no immediate danger to the larger towns of Beechworth and Yackandandah, on the northern edge of the fire area.
By February 10, firemen had completed a fire break around the Beechworth fire, and were trying to make more, as the fire still was burning out of control. By the afternoon, the fire threat had been downgraded, but firemen were fighting a new fire near Koetong, Victoria, east of the main Beechworth fire, of between to . People in Beechworth and nearby towns were told on the evening of February 10 to expect more smoke, as 250 firemen would be back burning to make more firebreaks.
The Beechworth Correctional Centre, a prison, offered up to thirty prisoners to help the firemen.
A fire west of the city of Bendigo burned out . The fire started at about 4.30pm on February 7, and burned through Long Gully and Eaglehawk, Victoria. It got to of central Bendigo, before it was brought under control late on February 8. It destroyed about 45 houses in Bendigo's western suburbs, and damaged an electricity transmission line; causing power failures in parts of the city. One man from Long Gully, ill and unable to leave his house, was killed in the fire;his neighbours tried hard but were not able to rescue him. The fire changed direction late on February 7, when the weather changed, and turned back towards Eaglehawk. It was controlled about midday on February 8.
A relief centre was set up at Kangaroo Flat, Victoria Senior Citizens Centre. During the fire, people from Long Gully, Eaglehawk, Maiden Gully, California Gully and West Bendigo were moved from their homes and sent to the centre. The police are investigating whether someone had lit this fire. The CFA think the fire started from a cigarette thrown from a car or truck on the highway.
In Redesdale, a fire burnt . The fire started west of the town. The fire was close to the towns of Baynton and Glenhope. Glenhope was threatened again on February 9 from a smaller fire that broke away from the main fire. More firemen and trucks were brought in from Bendigo and Kyneton. By February 10, the fire had been controlled, having destroyed 12 houses and farm buildings.
A fire at Bunyip State Park burned houses at Longwarry North, and Drouin West, Victoria, as well as farms and businesses, after the fire jumped the Princes Highway.
The fire was stopped by the afternoon of February 9, after it had burned through . The fire destroyed at least eight houses, other buildings and a factory. Fire crews began back-burning to stop the fire on February 9. People between Pakenham and Warragul, Victoria were warned about smoke from those fires.
many farmers, unable to keep animals on their farms because of fire damage, took them to nearby saleyards; by February 9, hundreds of cattle from the Bunyip fire were taken to the saleyards at Pakenham.
The Churchill fire began in a pine plantation south-east of Churchill, Victoria on the afternoon of February 7. Within 30 minutes it had spread to the south-east, near Hazelwood South, Traralgon South, Jeeralang, and Budgeree East, Victoria. By late afternoon the fire was near Yarram and Woodside, Victoria on the south Gippsland coast. The weather changed about 6.00pm, and the south west winds then pushed the fire north east towards Gormandale and Willung South on the Hyland Highway. About 500 people sheltered at a theatre in Traralgon.
The fire came close to the Loy Yang Power Station, and the station's open-cut coal mine. On the night of February 7, the fire approached the mine's overburden dump, but did not damage anything and did not stop the station's operations. Several small fires broke out in the bunker storing coal from the mine, but were contained with no damage. The threat eased by the evening of February 8, as temperatures cooled and some light rain fell. One small fire started south of the power station, but water bombing aircraft put it out.
By February 9, the Churchill fire was still burning out of control, with fronts through the Latrobe Valleyand the Strzelecki Ranges. By late afternoon, the fire had burnt out and killed several people. Wind changes that evening made parts of the fire worse, so the CFA warned people at Won Wron and nearby areas to be ready.
Police believe someone lit the Churchill fire. A man from Churchill was arrested by police on February 12. He was charged on February 13, with arson causing death, lighting a bushfire and having child pornography.
A fire started at Ferntree Gully and Upper Ferntree Gully, in the Dandenong Ranges. All major roads were closed. The fire damaged the railway track at Upper Ferntree Gully, causing the Belgrave railway line to be closed. The fire, which was controlled by firemen within three hours, burned along the railway.
A house fire started on the morning of February 12, in Upper Ferntree Gully, killing a volunteer fireman from the CFA. Police think the fire was deliberately lit.
In Narre Warren there were several fires. Six homes were destroyed in Narre Warren South and three in Narre Warren North.
On February 8, lightning started a fire at Wilsons Promontory which quickly burnt over . This fire did not threaten the camping area but the National Park rangers decided to evacuate the park; some campers were taken out by boat. The fire continued to burn out of control for more than 10 days. By February 17 it had burned an area of including the air strip and cutting the main road.
The Horsham fire burnt , including the golf club and eight homes. The Dimboola fire appliance (utility) was also damaged.
The fire started at 12.30pm on February 7, when strong winds blew over a power pole at Remlaw, west of the city. The fire first went south-west and then south-east, across the Wimmera Highway and Wimmera River to the Horsham Golf Course and then to Haven, south of the city. Firemen were able to save the general store, town hall and school at Haven, though flames came within metres of those buildings. Winds of up to changed direction three times during the day, and caused conditions described by a CFA fireman as the worst he had ever seen. A taxi driver picked up an 82-year-old wheelchair-bound woman and her daughter, from her house as the fire was no more than away; the house was alight as the taxi drove off, and burned down within minutes.
At 3.00pm more than 400 firemen were fighting the fire, as well as two water-bombing aircraft, 54 Country Fire Authority (CFA) fire trucks, and 35 Department of Sustainability and the Environment (DSE) fire crews. By 6.00pm the fire had moved east, and as the wind changed, was then pushed north-east across the Western Highway to Drung, east of Horsham.
At Coleraine were burnt; one man was badly burned.
The Country Fire Authority (CFA) puts out fires on private property. The Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) puts out fires on public land. These organisations worked together to fight all these fires. Most men and women from the CFA were trained volunteers; there were more than 4,000 of them involved.
In addition to CFA and DSE firefighters, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd offered assistance from the Australian Defence Forces. New South Wales, South Australia, Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania and Western Australia sent firemen and equipment.
The Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and New Zealand offered help to the Australian government. New Zealand sent 100 firemen and forest fire experts. They would have sent more but did not because of the danger of fires in parts of New Zealand. New Zealand also sent a Mil Mi-8MTV-1 helicopter which can carry 5000 litres of water.
173 people are known to have been killed by the fires. The death toll used to be at 210, but forensics found that a lot of the human remains that were thought to have been of two or more people were of one person.
Brian Naylor, a famous retired television news reader, and his wife Moiree, died in the Kinglake West area. Actor Reg Evans and his partner, artist Angela Brunton, who lived on a small farm in the St. Andrews area, also died in the Kinglake area fire. Ornithologist Richard Zann died in the Kinglake fire, with his wife Eileen and daughter Eva.
Over 500 people were treated for burns with 100 people were sent to hospital.
A temporary morgue to hold up to 300 bodies, was set up at the Coronial Services Centre at Southbank in Melbourne. This was like the one set up after the July 2005 London bombings. A number of different funeral homes helped take bodies to Melbourne. By February 10, 101 bodies had been taken to the temporary morgue. There were more than 50 unnamed bodies kept in the morgue or still at the fire areas. The director of the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine said that it may be impossible to discover the names of all the bodies.
On February 11, Police Commissioner Nixon said she hoped that searches for bodies would be over by February 15. Because there might be asbestos in some of the destroyed buildings, the search would be slow.
People from other countries were killed in these bushfires, including:

Burglary

Burglary is a crime. A person who does a burglary is called a burglar. In a burglary, the burglar breaks into a place (like another person's house or car) with the goal of stealing something.

RFID

Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a technology to record the presence of an object using radio signals. It is used for inventory control or timing sporting events. RFID is not a replacement for the barcoding, but a complement for distant reading of codes.
The technology is used for automatically identifying a person, a package or an item. To do this, it relies on "RFID tags". These are small "transponders" (combined radio "receiver" and "transmitter") that will transmit identity information over a short distance, when asked. The other piece to make use of RFID tags is an RFID tag reader.
An RFID tag is an object that can be applied to or incorporated into a product, animal, or person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio waves. Some tags can be read from several meters away and beyond the line of sight of the reader. Most tags carry a plain text inscription and a barcode as complements for direct reading and for cases of any failure of radio frequency electronics.
Most RFID tags contain at least two parts. One is an integrated circuit for storing and processing information, modulating and de-modulating a "radio-frequency" (RF) signal, and other specialized functions. The second is an antenna for receiving and transmitting the signal.
There are generally two types of RFID tags: active RFID tags, which contain a battery, and passive RFID tags, which have no battery.
RFID systems are used for the following:

Hurricane Opal

Hurricane Opal was a major hurricane that formed in the Gulf of Mexico in September 1995.
Opal was the 9th hurricane of the highly active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. Opal was the strongest hurricane of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. It crossed the Yucatán Peninsula while still a tropical depression from September 27, then strengthened northward in the Gulf, becoming the most powerful Category 4 Atlantic hurricane before making a second landfall, October 4, in the Florida Panhandle near Pensacola as a 125-mph (201-km/h) hurricane. Opal devastated the Pensacola/Panhandle area with a 15-ft (5-m) storm surge and travelled up the entire state of Alabama, becoming a tropical storm in Tennessee. Opal also caused heavy damage in the mid-Atlantic states before dissipating.
Afterward, 50 people had died from flooding by Opal in Guatemala and Mexico, with another 13 deaths in the United States directly or indirectly related to Opal. Preliminary damage estimates were $3 billion.
The beginning of this storm started from a tropical wave that moved off of Africa on September 11. It disappeared into a low pressure while in the Caribbean Sea several days later. The wave was found again on September 27 and was good enough to become Tropical Depression Eighteen. Tropical Depression Eighteen made landfall in the Yucatán Peninsula shortly afterword. On September 30 Tropical Depression Eighteen strengthened into Tropical Storm Opal. Tropical Storm Opal continued west until October 2. On October 2 it turned northeast and strengthened into Hurricane Opal. After that Hurricane Opal strengthened fast and reached it's top winds of 150 mph (making it a category 4) on October 4, only two days after becoming a hurricane. Hurricane Opal continued northeast and weakened a little and made its last landfall in Santa Rosa Island, Florida on October 4 while a category 3 hurricane. Hurricane Opal did not weaken to a tropical storm till it was in Tennessee. Tropical Storm Opal weakened into a depression while it was over Ohio. Tropical Depression Opal became extratropical over Canada and died on October 6.
The name "Opal" was retired in the spring of 1996. In 2001, the name "Olga" was used instead, Olga was also used in 2007, and could be used in 2013.

Hurricane Charley

Hurricane Charley was the second hurricane and also the second major hurricane (category 3+) of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. Charley lasted from August 9 to August 15. Its strongest winds were 150 mph (240 km/h), classifying it as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.
The storm made landfall in southwestern Florida. It was the strongest hurricane to hit the United States since Hurricane Andrew, twelve years earlier. In the United States, Charley caused ten deaths and $15.4 billion in damage (2004 USD).
Charley did its damage in a very similar manner to Andrew: high winds caused almost all the damage, and both storms made landfall at low tide, preventing the storm surges from causing damage like they usually do when hurricanes make landfall. Both were compact storms upon landfall.

Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski

Erich Julius Eberhard von Zelewski or Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski (1 March 1899 – 8 March 1972), was a Nazi leader and a member of the SS, where he had the rank of "SS-Obergruppenführer". Although he was involved in the killing of thousands of people in Poland and Russia, he was never charged with war crimes.
His parents were Otto Jan Józefat von Zelewski, a Roman Catholic, and his wife Elisabeth Eveline Schimansky, a Lutheran. His name when he was born was Erich Julius Eberhard von Zelewski. He later changed his last name to add "von dem Bach" in the 1930s. He removed "Zelewski" from his name in November 1941 because of its Polish sound. 
He was born in Lauenburg, in Pomerania, in the old German Empire (now called Lębork, Poland), on 1 March 1899. His family did not have very much money during his childhood. His father was often out of work. When his father died on April 17, 1911, in Dortmund, he was employed as an insurance clerk. His father's lack of success was partly because he was the brother of Emil von Zalewski, the leader of a colonial force fighting in Tanzania. On August 17, 1891, he and his men were killed in the battle of Rugarto, described as being like a German Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn. This death and defeat brought great shame to the family. Erich would later restore his family's position in the community.
After his father's death, his uncle Oskar von Zalewski, a soldier, became very close to Erich and told Erich to become a soldier. In November 1914 Erich von Zalewski asked to join the Prussian army, and was one of the youngest soldiers and remained a soldier fighting for the army until the end of World War I. He was wounded twice, and was given the Cross of Honor (Ehrenkreuz) and then Iron Cross.
After the war, he stayed in the army and fought in the Silesian Uprisings, where he earned a reputation (what other people believe about a person) for courage. He was given more medals. In 1924, he joined "Grenzschutz" (border guards). On October 23, 1925, he changed changed his last name to `von dem Bach-Zalewski`. 
He left the "Grenzschutz" in 1930, when he joined the Nazi Party, becoming a member of the SS in 1931. He was quickly promoted and by the end of 1933 had reached the rank of "SS-Brigadeführer". However, he quarreled with his staff officer Anton von Hohberg und Buchwald. 
Three of his sisters married Jewish men, and in 1946 he said that this ruined his reputation in the army and he was forced to leave. 
He was a member of the Reichstag from 1932 to 1944, he took part in the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, and had Anton von Hohberg und Buchwald murdered. He served in many Nazi party jobs, first in East Prussia and after 1936 in Silesia. By 1937 he had become the "Höherer SS- und Polizeiführer" ("HSSPF" – Higher SS and Police Leader) in Silesia.
After the war started, units under his command took part in revenge and in the shooting of POWs during the September Campaign, but von dem Bach was not there in person. On 7 November 1939, the SS chief Heinrich Himmler asked him if he wanted the job of "Commissioner for the Strengthening of Germandom" in Silesia. His duty was to force people to leave and to take their property. By August 1940, his units had forced more than 20,000 Żywiec families to leave their homes.
In late 1939, he suggested starting a concentration camp for the non-German people who lived in the town of Oświęcim. Heinrich Himmler agreed to von dem Bach's suggestion and in May 1940 the Auschwitz concentration camp opened.
On 22 June 1941, von dem Bach-Zelewski became "HSSPF" in the "Heeresgruppe Mitte" (Army Group Center); in July 1943, he became commander of the "Bandenkämpfverbände" ("Band-fighting Units"), that carried out the mass murder of 35,000 people in Riga and more than 200,000 in Belarus and eastern Poland. The government was going to make him the future "HSSPF" in Moscow; however, the Wehrmacht did not get into the city. Until 1943, von dem Bach-Zalewski was the "HSSPF" in command of "anti-partisan" units on the "central front", a special command created by Adolf Hitler. Von dem Bach-Zalewski was the only "HSSPF" in the Soviet areas taken over by the Germans to have real authority over the police after Hans-Adolf Prützmann and Jockeln lost theirs to the civil government. 
In February 1942, he was put into hospital, which he would later say was due to a nervous breakdown because of the ethnic cleansing in Belarus, and the genocide of the Jews. Radio signals overheard by British intelligence say, however, that his illness was physical. He went back to his job in July, with no reduction seen in his actions.
In June 1942, after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in Prague, Adolf Hitler wanted von dem Bach-Zelewski to take Heydrich's job as Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia. When Himmler said that von dem Bach-Zelewski was needed due to the situation in Belarus, Hitler let him stay and gave the job to Kurt Daluege. 
On 12 July 1943, von dem Bach-Zalewski was given command of all anti-partisan efforts in Belgium, Belarus, France, the General Government, the Netherlands, Norway, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, and parts of the Bialystok District. In reality he remained only in Belarus and the area of Russia near Belarus.
In 1944, von dem Bach-Zalewski took part in front line fighting in the Kovel area, but in March had to go to Germany for medical treatment. Himmler took over all his jobs.
On 2 August 1944, he took command of all soldiers fighting against the Warsaw Uprising as "Korpsgruppe Bach". Units under his command killed about 200,000 people including more than 65,000 executions, and an unknown number of POWs. After more than two months of heavy fighting and the total destruction of Warsaw he then was able to control the city. For what he did in Warsaw, the Nazi Government gave him the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on September 30, 1944.
Von dem Bach-Zelewski went into hiding and tried to leave the country. However, US military police arrested him on 1 August, 1945. Because he told the Allies what he knew about his former bosses at the Nuremberg Trials, von dem Bach-Zelewski never went to trial himself for any war crimes. He also did not have to go back to Poland or to the USSR to be tried. He left prison in 1949. 
In 1951, von dem Bach-Zalewski said that he had helped Hermann Göring kill himself in 1946. To make people believe this he showed them the cyanide with serial numbers like the ones that were on the cyanide that Göring used. This was never proven. Today people who study history do not believe this happened.
Also in 1951, von dem Bach was told he would go to a work prison for ten years for the murder of people in the early 1930s; but he did not go until 1958, when he was found guilty of killing Anton von Hohberg und Buchwald, an SS officer on the Night of the Long Knives and was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. In 1961, he received an extra ten years where he had to stay in his home all the time for the murder of ten German Communists in the early 1930s. He never went to prison for crimes during the war even though he openly said he murdered Jews. He died in a Munich prison on 8 March 1972.
It has been said that Hitler really liked von dem Bach-Zalewski because he was very good at his job and said that von dem Bach was "so clever he can do anything, get around anything."

<doc id="166913" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166913" title="Specialized English">
Specialized English

Specialized English is a controlled version of the English language used for radio broadcasting, easier for non-native speakers of English. It is based on Voice of America (VoA) Special English.
Specialized English was set up initially by Feba Radio in the UK. Feba now uses Specialized English with US radio companies Words of Hope and Back to God Ministries International. All three are Christian, but Specialized English is not used for religious preaching programs. Its main use is in the features service program 'Spotlight', which is widely broadcast on over sixty outlets globally. Scripts and audio are also available freely on the Spotlight website.
Specialized English sounds the same as Special English, and it almost is the same. Both use a 1500 word core vocabulary, short sentences, and slow delivery (about 90 words per minute). Special English was used from about 1959 by Voice of America. Specialized was written in the late 1990's, independently of Voice of America. The basic design is identical, but there is a slight difference in the vocabulary, and Specialized is more international. VoA is a federal US government department, so it doesn't make Special English programs for anything other than VoA's own use. Specialized English was designed by the civil society, and the developers try to make programs for several purposes. The developers of Specialized felt they should choose a name to show both the similarity and the difference.
The reason that Specialized was based on Special English is related to their respective usage. They are not primarily teaching tools (even though they are popular as an aid to learning) but communication tools. The choice of words in the 1500 word list depends to a degree on what is to be communicated. Most of the words are the most frequently learned, most commonly used English words. Both tools use these words. But many words are chosen for the intended purpose. For example, Special English uses words a US government news service might need, such as Congress, federal, administration, capitalism and recession. Specialized replaces some of these words with words used for religious subjects, such as blessing, prayer, miracle, and faith. The Specialized English word list has been revised in 2000 and 2007, in the light of experience. Still, the overlap of the two vocabularies is 91.3%. The Specialized English word list allows greater breadth of meaning in some of the words used in both lists. For example, the word 'joint':
Special: joint - ad. shared by two or more
Specialized: joint - ad. shared by two or more; n. the place where two parts or things are fixed together.
Specialized also allows more prefixes and suffixes, which has allowed some words to be removed from the core list. (e.g.: wonderful not needed in the list because it can be built from wonder+ful)
As well as the 1500 word core vocabulary, both Special and Specialized English also generally allow: inflections of the core words, numbers up to a million, pronouns, proper nouns, and any words whose meaning can be communicated in real time (in a radio broadcast) using the core vocabulary.
The following table lists some differences between the two methods.

Steamboat

A steamboat (also called a steamship or steamer) is a ship that uses a steam engine or steam turbine to move. At first, these were paddle steamboats. Some had a paddle wheel on the back. Others had two wheels on the sides. Most went down rivers. From about 1836, marine propellers, invented by Josef Ressel are used. Claude François Jouffroy d’Abbans built the first working steamship in 1783.
There were many steamboats in the 19th century in the United States and other countries. However, the first steamboat was built by John Fitch in 1787. It had many paddles. Fitch tried to make money from the steamboat, but could not do so. He died in 1798, and did not live long enough to see Robert Fulton become the first person to build a steamboat that could make money. In 1807, Fulton built a steamboat that could travel from New York City to Albany in 32 hours. Steamboats became much faster later in the 19th century.
After the middle 19th century paddle steamers became rare, as the marine propeller gave more speed and burned less fuel. During the 20th century, marine Diesel engines largely replaced steam propulsion.

As the field is always a ring, it consists of a set (represented here with the letter R) with two operations: addition (+) and multiplication (•). The properties of a ring are:
A field is a ring with these rules:
Another way of describing a field is this:
Examples for fields are 
The integers formula_9 are not a field, because you cannot always divide without a remainder.

Hi there all. While I believe that not everyone might agree with me on this, I would like to propose that we ban Kalajan from the Simple English Wikipedia for either a year or indefinitely. Ever since he or she (don't know what gender) has arrived on the Simple English Wikipedia, he has been nothing but a nuisance and has been a major disruption for the whole project. Furthermore, he has gotten completely out of line a number of times and I believe that enough is enough. Editors have tried to point him in the right direction, however, none of these attempts have been successful, and I highly doubt that a mentoring program here would work. Also, I worry about the current state of the Wikipedia, and I do not think that this editor is right for this project at this time. He has done nothing but stir up drama everyone he goes, and drama is something that we do not need on this Wikipedia at this point in time. Anyone else agree or disagree with what I have stated so far? 20:02, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

I saw no words that said indef or a year or whatever. Now, first of all. I also am trying with this user but my efforts have only begun when the community started this discussion, I would like a little more time to try to turn him around, Please. I believe I can do, and since the user seems to have an interest in wrestling I believe I and can be a Tag team, if after a while I believe it can't be done, I will support this users ban for a period of a year to turn around. I see promise in this user, and I do have strong beliefs that this user can be turned around with mentoring. Thoughts?--  20:40, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

No. There have been users who have been banned at enWP. They have come here, and they have showed ability to edit civilly. ChristianMan is most likely our best example. 16:04, 13 February 2009 (UTC)
All are good proposals and I think it is good that we are all concerned about this and are thinking about it. I think it is important to minimize the disruptive impact that banned users coming over from enWP have on our community. To this end, a one chance proposal is probably good with a ban for 3 or 6 months if they blow it; then a indef ban if they blow the second chance after being unbanned within 6 months of the unbanning. I'd also recommend that the admins be given the "right" (which they actually already have) to ban these users at their discretion and only their discretion. This would stop disruption by having to hold a banning proposal every time it is needed. (Established users being banned would still go through a normal proposal). If they can make it a full 9 months without being blocked (also 9 months after being blocked for violating the one strike rule) then they would become established users and go through the normal block/ban procedure. Thoughts? 17:35, 13 February 2009 (UTC)
Majorly and I discussed Betacommand briefly a few days or so ago (Beta has a long history on en of making semi-automated edits while making numerous errors in the process). He was given several off wiki chances, and was blocked by Majorly for making edits that appeared to be from a script/bot.

 made this edit to Christianity earlier tonight, claiming he was "cleaning up the biased article". I reverted the edit saying the article wasn't biased before until he made the edit (I thought it made the article atheistic), he proceeded to revert me, so I reverted back, we then got into on the articles talk page. During which I . He told me to come here if need be. The user during the conversation explained his edit, he claimed the article was stating the facts as if we believed them and thus made the article biased. He last reverted me and said he was going to bad, so, I reached my 3RR with one last revert with a edit summary saying that there is obviously a dispute so the original version must stand till the dispute is resolved. Am I wrong, or is this guy POV pushing?--  07:45, 23 February 2009 (UTC)
Hello all, I want to being some attention to Christianity and its NPOV. An IP, has added to it, saying therefore that is a myth (but argues that "myth" can also be a general dictionary idea...). Also, the user added that Jesus (an un-disputed real-person) is only a "character", and therefore fictional. To avoid that particular dispute, I changed "character", to simply the center of the New Testament, and the IP reverted regardless. Both additions are from the IP's POV: Christianity (and not other religions) being simply a myth, and Jesus being fictional. This needs outside discussion. I have semi-protected the page for now, until this discussion is over. Thank you. 22:06, 24 February 2009 (UTC)
Are you honestly calling Jesus an undisputed real person? It is extremely disputed that he was a real person, one of the most prevalent theorys is that he was just created as a character to explain the beliefs that christians believed in and that over time it was forgotten that it was just a story and people started taking it literally. If it were modern day for example, that his stories were just various brochures that were passed out to people. - () 13:33, 25 February 2009 (UTC)

Hi all,
Just FYI, I'm back now. I had a great deal to do. I had two deaths in the family and a graduation and a new job to deal with. I'm going to start with some topics regarding Nazi Germany for the foreseeable future. Glad to see we got the rollback bit going on! Who do I ask for it? Take care 07:04, 9 February 2009 (UTC)
Hello all, I suggest that we break away from the grips of en: and we change the icons for GA and VGA so that they are both stars, but the VGA star looks more golden than bronze.
My goal would actually to be that and be the VGA stars, but somebody render an identical silver version of it in SVG to be the good article stars. Thoughts? Comments? 07:38, 9 February 2009 (UTC)
I have changed it to a green star. If you don't like it, please feel free to revert it. 21:14, 9 February 2009 (UTC)
Please stop changing it to a star. It takes time for a few of our editors to notice discussion like this, and you'll have to wait until other people express their opinions before making any more changes to templates. 21:17, 9 February 2009 (UTC)
I think that they should definately both be stars because the average reader (the person we all "work" for) recognizes a star as being the pinacle of any image to identify "quality". I also think that VGA should be gold (platinum is too silver looking for our purposes) because gold is most frequently the top prize (see: the Olympics). As for the GA star, I really like green from an astheic viewpoint, but silver is more traditional, but 'd be okay with either. I do think the silver should appear more silver, rather than the gray it looks like in my browser (Opera) at the moment. The GA#2 star above is clsoer to the silver (metalic) I'd be looking for, but I'm not dogmatic about it. 04:36, 10 February 2009 (UTC)
Here is my final suggestion:
Hello everyone. I don't know if this has already been discussed (not in the 5 months I've been here I don't think) but have we thought of having good/featured lists or topics?

Hello everybody. In the short time I've been at the Simple English Wikipedia, I've noticed many people are denying proposals because either the community's too small or they're perfectly complacent with how the wiki's running right now. I don't mean to attack anybody at all, but could we all look past the present and think of the future? Could we all get over our fears of change and approve requests based on how it will better the community? An example of this is the Wikicup. A particular user stated that the Wikicup should be killed because it's too much of a hassle to take care of. Others shot down my star proposition because they liked things the way they were. In other discussions about Wikiprojects and a standardized grading system, people opposed because our wiki is too small. I don't know about you guys, but I feel that this wiki cannot expand if we do not expand our horizons and expand the activities we do here. Could we stop saying in every single proposition and start saying ? I'm probably going to get stoned for saying such an "anarchic" statement to the community... 22:37, 16 February 2009 (UTC)
Like I said, I wouldn't be surprised that my contributions (or lack of) would be criticized here. Why am I here? Because I thought my thoughts would matter, especially to a really small wiki. Surprise! Nobody really cares, because the wiki's too small, and I'm allegedly going to run away because I'm bored, and as long as my contributions aren't directly related to simplifying words, nobody really cares that much. 03:10, 17 February 2009 (UTC)
Why did change? Personally, I like the original one better. 00:19, 17 February 2009 (UTC)

Wikipedia:Guide to appealing blocks

This is a guide to making believable unblock requests.
Users may be from changing Wikipedia by s to stop damage or disruption to Wikipedia. Blocks are cancelled if they are not (or no longer) needed to stop such damage or disruption.
You, as a blocked user, are responsible for convincing administrators:
Making convincing unblock requests is also important for other reasons:
To make an unblock request, copy the following text to the bottom of : codice_1. Don't forget to insert your own reason. We will talk about what your reason should and shouldn't have below. 
It may help with your unblock request if you understand how they are reviewed, and by who.
In practice, almost all unblock requests are declined. This is because almost all blocks are found to be justified. But if "yours" is the rare exception, you should try to make it as easy as possible for the reviewing administrator to see why. Administrators are volunteers; most do not want to make much more of an effort in reviewing your request than "you" did in writing it.
To contest your block well, you must understand the reason for it. Also, if the reviewing administrator decides that the block was justified, she will not unblock you unless she is convinced that you understand what you are blocked for, and that you will not do it again.
You are told about the block reason in two ways. First, the blocking administrator provides a brief reason that you will see when you try to make a change. Second, he may leave a message explaining your block on . These messages should include the names or abbreviations of those of our site rules (the "") that the blocking administrator believes you have violated.
Before you make an unblock request, you should read the policies and guidelines named in your block reason. They are usually one or more from among the following: , , or having a . You should also review the .
As a user requesting to be unblocked, it is your responsibility to tell clearly and briefly, in easily readable English, why your block violated Wikipedia's . Specifically:
If you are blocked, it is because of your actions and not of that of others. Accordingly:
If you are blocked for something you did wrong, and especially if you are blocked for a long time, you are more likely to be unblocked if you:
Requests such as these are likely to be denied. If made repeatedly, they may also lead to your block being made longer or to your talk page being protected.
This is a list of bad unblock requests:
If you state in your request that the changes which led to your block were made by someone else who logged on to your account without your knowledge or permission, we will have to leave it blocked and request that you start over with a new account. You may have changed the password, but administrators have no way of knowing if it was even you who did this. It is better with respect to security for you to with a strong password, in any event.
 is clear: they are blocked for a long time without exception once identified. While some users can use them to circumvent censorship or filters, they have been used far too many times by far too many blocked vandals for Wikipedians to assume good faith on their part. This includes Tor nodes. If your server has been blocked as an open proxy, you will probably need to change using another connection: in most cases, proxies are "hard blocked", which stops even logged-in users from using the connection to change.
Sometimes readers who have never or rarely changed before, or not from that location, with no goal of making an account, click on "change this page" only to find that changing from their IP address is blocked, for something they didn't do. If you are here because this happened to you, there are two possibilities.
Accusations of result in many blocks and almost as many unblock requests, as calls for the sockpuppet account to be blocked indefinitely and the sockpuppeteer to be blocked for some length of time. Users confirmed or believed to have engaged in the practice must request unblock at their main account. will be blocked indefinitely, too ... don't change on behalf of someone else, no matter how well you may know them.
Reviewing admins will usually defer to the blocking admin in a sockpuppetry-based block, especially if the sock account has few changes. If the tool was used to determine that sockpuppetry had occurred, only another administrator with access to Checkuser can overturn the block as only they have access to the evidence on which it was based. 'Do not' make an unblock request that includes a request for checkuser to "prove your innocence". Those are rarely done that you're better off not asking. Most administrators consider such an unblock request a sure sign of a sock account (particularly one with very few changes otherwise) and will decline on that basis.
Even without the use of Checkuser, or with a result of "unrelated", an account that makes the same changes as a different blocked account, has the same linguistic peculiarities and the same general interests may remain blocked.
Wikipedia admins can never be absolutely sure about sockpuppetry, and the most abusive users can be very sneaky in trying to stop detection. If you are improperly blocked for sockpuppetry, you should realize that it may not always be easy or even possible to correct the situation.
Accounts with usernames that violate are often blocked indefinitely, regardless of their changing behavior.
Most such accounts are soft-blocked, meaning a new account may be created while the old one is blocked. This is done because it is the account name, not the behavior of the person behind it, which is the problem. While it is possible to , this takes a little longer and requires that a user with access do so. Whichever method you choose, it is a good idea to have some review of the proposed new username first, to avoid ending up in the same quandary.
An account with a username that indicates that they are trying to be disruptive, uses hateful or obscene language or otherwise shows that the user has disruptive or provocative intent will be hard blocked, meaning that an unblock request will be required.

Violone

The violone (pronounce: "Vee-o-LOH-ne") is a very big string instrument that used to be used in the 16th and 17th centuries. It is like a double bass, but it belongs to the viol family. The name "violone" means "large viol". It was really a "double-bass viola da gamba". It usually had six strings, and the fingerboard had frets (like a guitar) which showed where to put the fingers of the left hand to make the notes. The bow was held underhand (with the palm of the hand facing up).
The violone is sometimes heard today in early music groups who are playing Renaissance and early Baroque music music. The instruments used today are usually ones that have been made recently to look and sound like the old ones.
The violone was the last member of the viol family to die out. When the other sizes of viol had been replaced by orchestras with violins, violas and cellos the violone was often used instead of a double bass. Bach used the violone in his cantatas. Eventually the violone was no longer used, and the double bass was used instead. The double bass still looks a little bit like the old viol because it has sloping shoulders and the strings are tuned in fourths.
In organs "Violone" is the name given to a soft organ stop made of metal or wood, usually in the pedals.

Tragedy of the commons

The tragedy of the commons was an article published by Garrett Hardin in the journal "Science" in 1968. It describes a problem where many people with their own ideas can make something they all share worse, even if no one wants to. For example, even if no one wants to pollute water because that makes it unhealthy, it can still end up like that because so many want to use the water for their own reasons, like washing and throwing away rubbish. Each person thinks that their small bit of pollution of the water is too small to affect the quality of the water, but because there are many people the total effect ends up making the water too polluted for mostly anybody to use for drinking or even washing. This may occur in slums and other overcrowded places like refugee camps.
The idea was not Hardin's, but a person writing in 1833, William Forster Lloyd. In those days people often grazed cows and sheep on common land. Sheep graze more closely than cows. Lloyd pointed out that each sheep added benefited its owner, but made the grazing overall was damaged by overgrazing.
The tragedy of the commons is very clear in modern debates on ecology. It is also a topic in game theory.

David Popper

David Popper (born Prague, 16 June 1843; died Baden, Austria, 7 August 1913) was a Bohemian cellist and composer. He composed many works for the cello which today are performed by cellists all over the world.
Popper was born in the old Jewish part of Prague. His father was a Cantor in two synagogues. When he was three years old he was imitating his father’s singing. He learned the violin when he was six and, at the age of twelve, he got a place to study music at the Prague Conservatory, but he had to learn the cello. His cello teacher was Julius Goltermann. His first job was as cellist to the Prince of Hohenzollern who soon gave him the title “Kammervirtuoso”. He was only 21 when he played a difficult concerto by Robert Volkmann. The conductor, Hans von Bülow, was very impressed and so were the critics. He gave many concerts in Vienna and became very famous. He started to travel around Europe, visiting England and Russia. He had a lot of energy and was able to compose a lot while travelling. He composed many short cello pieces. His "Elfentanz" (Dance of the Elves) and "Spinning Song" were especially popular with the audiences.
In 1886 Popper married for the second time. In the same year he took up a job at the Royal Hungarian Academy of Music in Budapest. He was a famous teacher and charged a high fee for lessons. He formed a string quartet with three other musicians including the violinist Jenő Hubay. Hubay and Popper often played piano trios with Johannes Brahms. 
Popper made a long visit to England and Scotland where he was described as the world’s greatest cellist by many people including George Bernard Shaw. When he returned to Prague he played with Béla Bartók who was only 19 years old and not yet famous. He was also impressed when he heard the young Pablo Casals, although he did not agree with his technique.
Popper had one son who died of tuberculosis in 1911. Two years later Popper slipped on an icy pavement. He was never able to use his right arm again. He died the next summer of a heart attack.
Popper composed a very large number of cello pieces, many of which are short pieces suitable for encores at a recital. One of the most popular (and not too difficult) is the "Gavotte in D major". He composed a "Requiem" for three cellos and orchestra, and he wrote four cello concertos. However, his most important work for cellists is a collection of studies called "Hochschule des Violoncellspiels" ("High School of Cello Playing"). This book contains 40 etudes, or musical exercises to develop technique, and is widely used today by cello students to improve their playing.

Mud volcano

A mud volcano or mud dome is a kind of volcano that is made by liquids and gases from the earth. There are many different ways that mud volcanoes can be made. Temperatures in a mud volcano are much cooler than that of a regular volcano. The biggest mud volcanoes are 10 kilometers in diameter and can be as tall as 700 meters. Most of the gases given off by mud volcanoes are methane. Other gases given off include carbon dioxide and methane. They usually spit out liquids with solids in the liquids. An example of this would be water with salt or acids in the water.
A mud volcano is usually made by mud diapir that breaks out of the surface of the Earth or on the ocean bottom. Temperatures in mud volcanoes can be as low as the freezing point. 
Mud volcanoes are often linked with places where petroleum gathers and around areas of tectonic subduction. They can also be linked with orogenic belts where hydrocarbon gases usually erupt. They are also often linked with lava volcanoes as well. However, instead of spitting out magma, mud volcanoes spit out gases like methane and carbon dioxide.
Around 1,100 mud volcanoes have been found on land and in shallow water. People think that more than 10,000 mud volcanoes may exist on continental slopes and abyssal plains.
There are many features of mud volcanoes. One of these features is the gryphon, which is a steep, short cone that gives off mud. Another feature is the mud cone, which is a tall cone that makes mud and small pieces of rock. The scoria cone is a cone that is made when of mud are heated up and the salse, which are pools of water that leak gases out of them. Mud volcanoes have many other features, but most of these are notable.
Most of the things that mud volcanoes spit out happen during volcanic . Other eruptions have been known to happen during the time when a volcano is dormant or sleeping.
There are very few mud volcanoes in Europe, but quite a few are on the Taman Peninsula of Russia and the Kerch Peninsula in the southeastern part of Ukraine. In Italy, many mud volcanoes are near the Apennines and in Sicily. Also in Europe are the Berca Mud Volcanoes, near Berca in Buzău County, Romania. Many mud volcanoes are by the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Movement from tectonic plates have made areas of mod volcanoes that spit out hydrocarbons and methane. Some of the tallest mud volcanoes are in Azerbaijan. Mud volcanoes are also in Iran and Pakistan in the Makran mountain range.
China has a lot of mud volcanoes in the Xinjiang province. There are two active mud volcanoes in the southern part of Taiwan. The island of Baratang, which is part of the Great Andaman group of islands in the Andaman Islands, Indian Ocean also have a few active mud volcanoes.
People think that 300 of the mud volcanoes out of the 700 mud volcanoes on Earth are in the eastern part of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea. In 2001, one mud volcano about 15 kilometers away from Baku was in the world news when it suddenly started spitting out flames 15 meters high.

Black smoker

A black smoker is a kind of hydrothermal vent that can be found on the ocean floor. It is a crack in the planet's surface from which geothermally heated water comes out. Hydrothermal vents are commonly found near volcanically active places, areas where tectonic plates are moving apart, ocean basins, and hotspots.
Hydrothermal vents are common on earth because it is both geologically active and has large amounts of water on its surface and within its crust. Common land types include hot springs, fumaroles and geysers. The most famous hydrothermal vent system on land is probably within Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Under the sea, hydrothermal vents may form features called "black smokers".
Relative to the majority of the deep sea, the areas around submarine hydrothermal vents are biologically more productive, often hosting complex communities fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids. Chemosynthetic archaea form the base of the food chain, supporting diverse organisms, including giant tube worms, clams, limpets and shrimp.
Active hydrothermal vents are believed to exist on Jupiter's moon Europa, and ancient hydrothermal vents have been speculated to exist on Mars.

In the old days, China and Japan used a 12-hour system to tell the time of day and night (unlike the 24 hour system used today). The 12 hour system divides the day of 24 hours into 12 hours, each of which has a sign of the zodiac:
The Chinese and Japanese would call the different directions (North, Northeast, Northwest, East, South, Southeast, Southwest, West), based on the names of the zodiac animals.

Kennedy is generally viewed as a face of wisdom around here, and definitely has the experience to make a great crat.

Late co-nom from : Hello there all. Sorry for posting this so late, but I just had to co-nominate Kennedy. This user is one of the only users on this site that I fully trust and trust enough to give the bureaucrat tools to. Since he has become an administrator, he has made some mistakes, but most of them were honest mistakes that were easily fixed. The best part about this is that Kennedy realized what he did wrong and fixed his behavior so that he didn't make the same mistakes again. He has been very active in the community and while he has been an administrator, has helped out the project in more ways than you can shake a stick at. He has also demonstrated that he has a cool head in heated situations, which makes me all the more want to co-nominate him. Cheers, 18:21, 17 February 2009 (UTC)

Color of the day (police)

The color of the day is a signal used by undercover officers of some big city police departments in the USA. It is used to help stop uniformed police officers shooting undercover police officers who they do not know are police officers. It is mostly known to be used by the New York City Police Department (NYPD), the NYPD Transit Bureau (which was called the "New York City Transit Police") and the NYPD Housing Bureau (which was called the "New York City Housing Authority Police Department") and other law enforcement agencies when they are at work in New York City. An undercover police officer will wear a headband, wristband or other piece of clothing in the same color as the "color of the day"; this color is told to officers at the station house before they start work. The system is for officer safety and first started during the violence of 1970s and 1980s New York City. The color of the day system is not known by most of the public but it is written about a lot by newspapers, and by writers and can sometimes be seen on episodes of television shows such as NYPD Blue and recently .
New York City is a very large metropolitan city with a population of over 8,310,000 people with over 18,800,000 people living in the area around it. An extra 500,000 people enter the city during a weekday. It has many police and law enforcement officers such as; the NYPD, the (MTA) Police (that used to be called the Metro North Commuter Railroad Police), the Port Authority Police, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and U.S. Customs and others. The color of the day system is about officer safety. With so many armed officers in the city, undercover police officers need to have an easy to use system in place so that other armed officers know that they are there and do not shoot them when they use their guns. The system is also used so that a uniformed officer will not disturb a person who is really an undercover police officer who is acting as a homeless person so that criminals will rob him.
The NYPD Street Crimes Unit started in 1971. During the late 1970s, the 1980s and early 1990s, New York City had a lot more crime than it does today. Undercover officers were asked to go into the subways in plain-clothes or dressed as a homeless person to hide the fact that they were police. Many of these officers were black and had a fear that as they looked like civilian homeless people that uniformed officers would think that they were criminals if they used their guns. Many of these officers would dress and pretend to be drunk homeless people or as victims in order to catch muggers who were attacking them due to being unable to help themselves. The color of the day system was made to make these officers fear this less and was used by all undercover police officers. At the beginning headbands were given out to each street crime unit member, that were in the color of the day: beginning the use of the color of the day system. Later this included wristbands and today's officers often dress in the color: i.e.: T-shirts, shoes, and hats.
The color of the day recognition system is written about by authors and people who study the police in schools but it is not often known about by most people in New York. Books that talk about it are Roger Abell's "The Black Shields" (a discussion of African American policing in New York), Greg Faliis' "Just the Facts Ma'am", and Leslie Glass' novel, "A Killing Gift".

Titanoboa was the largest known snake. Now extinct, the snake was a relative of the "Anaconda" and the "Boa constrictor". It was about 42 feet long (12.8 m), and weighed over a ton (about 1135 kg or 2500 pounds). The snake lived in the Palaeocene epoch, about 58 million years ago. 
The fossil was found in an open-cast coal mine in Colombia, in 2009. Plant fossils at the site proved the climate at the time was a tropical rainforest. The site was in the Cerrejón Formation in La Guajira, Colombia. Other large reptile fossils have been found at this site.

This page shows you how to create a book from Wikipedia articles in three steps. Books can be created in PDF form or ordered for printing on the PediaPress website.
STEP BY STEP 
HOW TO CREAT A BOOK FOR OTHERS THAT MEANS OF MAKING BOOK 
GUTTER JUST LIKE COVERD 
The book collection menu, "create a book", is on the left of the browser screen. 
It contains two links: "Add page to book" and "Books help". 
By clicking on the "Add page to book" link, the current page being viewed is added to the collection. 
To add more pages you must navigate to the next page and click "Add page to book" again. 
You can also add all pages in a category with one click. 
The number of pages in the book is shown in the menu on the left and updated automatically.
Once all desired pages have been added, click the "Show book" button to review your book. At this time you can add an optional title to your book, and can also change the order of wiki pages in the book (see details of how to do this in the Advanced Functions section).
A finished book can be downloaded or ordered as a bound book. You can download a book in PDF or OpenDocument format (viewable using OpenOffice.org software), by clicking the "Download" button (see Fig 3). To order as a bound book click the "Order book from PediaPress" button. Further information on printed books can be found in FAQ.
Changing the order of wiki pages
To change the order of wiki pages in your book simply move pages in the list entitled "Your Book". To do so, hover over a page title to move, click and drag it to a new location. Release the mouse button to finish moving a page to its new location. You can also automatically sort the book into alphabetical order.
Saving and sharing your book with others
To save your book you must have a registered account on Wikipedia (see for details on how to create an account). You can save your book on the "Book" page which can be reached by clicking the "Show book" link in the menu on the left hand side. In the "Save and share your book" section choose one of the location options and then provide a title for the book collection. It will then be saved by clicking the "Save book" button.
Further information
Further information on the books feature is at for experts page. This page explains how the presentation of books can be changed and how to process saved books at a later date.
By clicking the "Order book from PediaPress" button, your collection of wiki articles can be printed as a bound book. You will be forwarded to the website of PediaPress, a service that prints books based on wiki content. Further information about the printed books, including the cost and format can be found on the FAQ page.

This page gives experienced users details on the advanced functions of the Book tool. Among other things it explains how the layout of books can be improved and how books are stored on Wikipedia.
Add a particular revision to your book
Older revisions of a page can be added to a book collection instead of the current version by using the history tab. By choosing loading the relevant older revision from the history page, the wiki page can be added to the book in the same way as before, by clicking the "Add wiki page" link in the menu on the left. (See the for more help). If an older revision has been added, this specific revision will always be used. If you add the most current version of a wiki page, always the latest revision will be used.
Add the entire contents of a category in one click
To add the entire contents of a category in one click first navigate to the relevant category page. Then click the "Add category" link in the "Create a book" section of the menu on the left hand side.
Format of stored book pages
A book with the title "My book" and the subtitle "Example", with two chapters named "Foo" and "Bar", each containing three articles, with the last article having a fixed revision number would be shown using the following syntax.
You can also create books without the use of the input box and Special:Books page. The wiki syntax to use is:
Location of books
Books can either be saved in the user's namespace or as a community book at . All books are grouped into the .
Each wiki page that is a member of the category can be loaded by clicking the "Load book" link on the left hand menu on the page.
Some wiki-markup can lead to problems in the generation of PDF documents as part of the book feature. This mainly applies to templates, which will be displayed differently in the PDF version compared to how they look in the online version of an article. This can be fixed by either substituting the current template or removing the template from the content that cause problems in the PDF. As a rule of thumb, all content (especially templates) that is not useful for an offline version of the document, should be excluded from the print version.
There are four ways to resolve issues caused by templates:
1) Exclude templates
A template can be excluded from content by adding it to the . 
Note: Many templates use other templates to function. Therefore groups/types of templates can be excluded by adding the commonly used template to this category.
2) Exclude certain specific content
By using , certain specific content, such as a few words or an image, can be excluded from printing.
Example: codice_1
3) Include certain specific content only in print versions
The can be used to insert content that shall only be visible in offline versions.
Example: codice_2
4) Substitute templates
You can create a print version of a template under the name "PrintTEMPLATENAME" with TEMPLATENAME being the name of the original template.
Using the extension it is currently impossible to create a collection of content from multiple different wikis. However this page shows how to create a book containing articles from multiple wikis.

Republic of Taiwan (1895)

The Republic of Taiwan was a short-lived republic on the island of Taiwan. It is also called in ; which means "Democratic State of Taiwan". In English it was also called the: Formosan Republic, Taiwan Republic and the Republic of Formosa.
The Republic of Taiwan was formed in 1895. It did not last for very long. The Treaty of Shimonoseki which ended the war between the Qing Dynasty of China and the Empire of Japan, gave Taiwan to the Japanese. The republic began when the Chinese left in May, 1895, and ended when the Japanese soldiers arrived in October, 1896. Some historians say it was the first republic in Asia, but there was one earlier, the Lanfang Republic, which had been started in 1777.
The republic was started by a group of high officials and local people who still supported the Qing. They wanted to stop the Japanese take over of Taiwan. On May 24, 1895 the new republic sent a copy of its declaration of independence to all the embassies on Taiwan. The next day the new government held an independence ceremony. The Republic of Taiwan made their own stamps. They also printed their own paper money, which is now very hard to find.
They were always loyal to the Qing, and said that the Republic would be part of the Qing state. The first president of the Republic of Taiwan was the old governor, Tang Ching-sung, who served from May 25, 1895 to June 5, 1895. The second president was Liu Yung-fu, June 5, 1895 – October 21, 1896.
When the Japanese soldiers invaded Taiwan there was a lot of fighting. They quickly defeated the new republic. Most of the republic's official quickly left the island.
The modern Taiwan independence groups want to start a new Republic of Taiwan. They say that there is no connection between them and the 1895 Republic. The first Republic of Taiwan was to China, but the new Republic of Tawian would be started to be independent of China.

<doc id="167498" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167498" title="Freikorps">
Freikorps

The word Freikorps (German for "Free Corps") was first used for voluntary armies in Germany. After World War I the term was used for paramilitary units. The Freikorps got famous at the time of the Weimar Republic to fight in some towns against the Communism.
The first freikorps were started by Frederick II of Prussia in the eighteenth century during the Seven Years' War. Other freikorps were started during the Napoleonic Wars and were commanded by people such as Ferdinand von Schill and later Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von Lützow. The freikorps were thought to be not by regular armies and were mostly used as guards and for minor duties.
The meaning of the word changed over time. After 1918, the word was used for the paramilitary organizations that were started in Germany by soldiers who came home after losing World War I. They were the main paramilitary groups during that time. Many of these returning soldiers were not able to return to a normal life, and joined a Freikorps to again be a part of a military structure. Others were angry at losing the war and joined to fight against Communists or get revenge. They were liked and supported by Minister of Defence Gustav Noske, a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, who used them to stop the German Revolution and the Marxist Spartacist League, and also to murder Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg on 15 January 1919. They were also used to defeat the Bavarian Soviet Republic in 1919.
In 1920, Adolf Hitler had started his political work as the leader of the very small and unknown German Workers Party (that was soon called the National Socialist German Workers Party, NSDAP (or Nazi Party)) in Munich. Many people who would join this party had been in the Freikorps, including Ernst Röhm, future leader of the Sturmabteilung, or SA, and Rudolf Höß, the future Commander of the Auschwitz concentration camp.
Hermann Ehrhardt, who started the Marinebrigade Ehrhardt, and his deputy Commander, Eberhard Kautter, did not want to help Hitler and Erich von Ludendorff in the Beer Hall Putsch.
Freikorps leaders gave their old battle flags to Hitler's SA and SS on Nov 9, 1933 in a very big . Historian Robert Waite said that Hitler had many problems with the Freikorps. Many of the Friekorps had joined the SA, so when the Night of the Long Knives happened, they were targets for being murdered or arrested and this was also done to Ehrhardt and to Röhm. Waite also says that in Hitler's 'Rohm Purge' speech to the Reichstag on July 13, 1934, that Hitler said that the Freikorps were enemies of Germany.
In 1939, in the Polish September Campaign, "Freikorps Ebbinghaus", was started to work behind the frontlines. It was not very good at this work and was sent to fight as an army unit but was not good at this either and was ended in less than one year.

Konstantin Freiherr von Neurath (2 February 1873 in Vaihingen – 14 August 1956 in Vaihingen) was a German politician, diplomat and a member of the "Reichstag". He was the Foreign minister of Germany between 1932 and 1938. In those early years of Adolf Hitler's regime, Neurath played an important role in the foreign policy. He helped the Nazi dictator to get around the Treaty of Versailles. He also helped in the territorial expansion before World War II. Hitler replaced Neurath with the more compliant and fervent Nazi Joachim von Ribbentrop. 
Neurath served as "Reichsprotektor of Bohemia and Moravia" between 1939 and 1943. When he started to work for "SS-Obergruppenführer" Reinhard Heydrich his authority became nominal. He was one of the 24 accused at the Nuremberg Trials. He was sentenced to 15 years in Spandau Prison. He was freed in 1954.

Recognition signal

A recognition signal is a signal where a person, a ship, an airplane or something else is recognized. They can be used during war or can be used to help the police recognize each other during undercover operations. It can also be used in biology to signal that a molecule or chemical is to be bound to another molecule. 
These signals are often used to recognize friends and enemies in a war. For military use these signals often use colored lights or the International marine signal flags
Other uses of the signal include the police who sometimes use a recognition signal so that officers in uniform can recognize officers in normal clothing (undercover). The NYPD often use headbands, wristbands or colored clothing as recognition signals which are known as the "color of the day".
A recognition signal is also a chemical signal used in biology to signal the end of a section of DNA or RNA during gene in cells.

New York City Police Department

The New York City Police Department (NYPD), started in 1844, is the largest police force in the United States. It is the police force that serves the five boroughs of New York City. The NYPD was one of the first "modern" style police departments in the United States with the Boston Police Department. The NYPD uses a color of the day to allow uniformed officers to recognize undercover officers to prevent accidental shootings. 
The New York Police Department's Street Crime Unit (motto: "We Own The Night") was a 300+ member plain clothes unit for reducing crime that became well known after the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo. The four officers who did the killing were all members of the unit. The unit was ended in 2002 because of the Diallo shooting. The unit's last leader was Inspector Bruce H. Smolka, who was later made Assistant Chief. The Street Crime Unit is now replaced by local precinct Anti-Crime Units.
All of the officers were found not guilty of the criminal charges in a long trial that took place in Albany after a successful request to change the location of the trial from the Bronx, where the shooting happened.
The Street Crime Unit was started in 1971 and had a long history of success in catching armed criminals on NYC streets. The establishment of the Street Crime Unit led to the development of the color of the day undercover officer recognition system.

Undercover

Being undercover means that a person is wearing normal clothing and is hiding their identity from people. It is often used by police officers when they are investigating crimes or criminals. It is done to gain trust and also possibly to gather evidence. It is not the same as a police officer who is wearing normal clothing (a plain-clothes officer) but who is not hiding their real name and that they are a police officer.

Metropolis

A metropolis is a word that means a very big city, that usually has over 500,000 people living in it. A metropolis often has many smaller towns and cities inside its area. The word is very old and began in Greece.
In a broader sense, it refers to the city or state of origin of a colony (as of ancient Greece), a city regarded as a center of a specified activity, or a large important city.
In the past many large cities were called a metropolis due to their size or importance; such as: Alexandria, Angkor, Antioch, Athens, Babylon, Baghdad, Beirut, Benares, Byblos, Cahokia, Carthage, Constantinople, Corinth, Damascus, Dholavira, Ephesus, Great Zimbabwe, Harappa, Jerusalem, Leptis Magna, Nanjing, Nineveh, Macchu Picchu, Mohenjo-Daro, Rome, Sarai, Side, Siracuse, Tenochtitlan, Teotihuacan, Tikal, Tyre, Xian and Ur.

Proboscis monkey

The proboscis monkey, "Nasalis larvatus", is found only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. 
They live in mangrove forests, and also lowland rainforests. It depends on the mangroves near river edges for resting and sleeping. They avoid deforested areas and avoid human settlements.
The proboscis monkey eats mainly fruit and leaves. It also eats flowers, seeds and insects to a lesser extent. At least 55 different plant species are eaten. Young leaves are preferred over mature leaves and unripe fruits are preferred over ripe fruit. Being a seasonal eater, the proboscis monkey eats mostly fruit from January to May and mostly leaves from June to December. Groups usually sleep in adjacent trees. Monkeys tend to sleep near rivers, if they are nearby. Proboscis monkeys will start the day foraging and then rest further inland. Proboscis monkeys' daily activities consist of resting, traveling, feeding and keeping vigilant.
The male proboscis monkey is known for its very unique, large floppy nose. Females have a smaller pointed nose. Another fact is that a baby proboscis, with its dark blue face and black furs, looks very different from its parents. As it gets older, its fur changes to the orange color of its parents.

I'm a medical doctor by trade and work in family medicine and emergency care (I drive an ambulance rapid response car). I have been an editor on enWP since December 2006 and feel I have a fairly good reputation there with the people who know me. I perform dispute resolution over there quite a bit (more than my logbooks would say as I got fed-up of constantly editing them). I am first-and-foremost a mainspace editor. I feel that it is in mainspace where a project will live or die. I don't like disputes (that involve myself) but find a great satisfaction is helping editors solve them. Here on seWP I am trying to build the Nazi Germany articles and also to write articles that have something to do with the police and/or New York City. I hate vandalism and don't understand the mentality of those who do it. I have rollback both here and on enWP and I use it whenever I see vandalism. I feel that I have always been and can't remember a time I've been rude to someone and would feel quite ashamed if I have been. I'm profoundly dyslexic and this is sometimes reflected in my edits! I have been here for a few months but I had to take some time off all Wiki activities due to two deaths in my immediate familty and due to attending a graduation (PhD) and starting a new job.

Christmas Island pipistrelle

The Christmas Island Pipistrelle ("Pipistrellus murrayi") was a species of bat in the Vespertilionidae family. Biologists believe the bat became extinct on 27 August 2009.
It was a small bat (it weighed 3 to 4.5 grams), and lived only on Christmas Island, Australia. It was thought to be the same as the "Pipistrellus tenuis", but research on the bat's baculum, (a penis bone), showed that "Pipistrellus murrayi" was a different species.
The numbers of Christmas Island Pipistrelle bats dropped a lot in the last 20 years. It was once seen all over the island, including in the Settlement. It went from at least 80% of its living range, and its numbers dropped more than 90% since 1994. Research into the number of bats in January 2009, shows there were only about 20 bats left. The only known group resting place had only four bats. The last bat call was heard on 26 August 2009.
Scientists do not know why the Christmas Island Pipistrelle's numbers dropped. Several possible threats may have been:
A number of animals brought to Christmas Island could be the problem:
Early in 2009, the Australian Minister for the Environment, Peter Garrett, stopped scientists from trying to set up a captive breeding program. He said that the bats were too hard to catch, and no one knew how to keep them alive in cages. Instead, he announced a program to breed a similar bat in the Northern Territory of Australia. Scientists would learn about caring and breeding bats, then use this information to save the Christmas Island Pipistrelle. Other scientists have said this will take too long, and the bats will be extinct. Scientists believed that by June 2009 there were only four of the bats left in the world. In July 2009, the Australian Government changed its earlier decision and said that it would try to capture the last of the bats and use them to try and breed more bats in captivity. During August and September 2009 scientists searched for the remaining bats to catch them and protect them. At the end of August only one bat had been heard. Scientists tried to catch this bat, but it has not been heard from since the night of 26 August. It is now believed that the bat is extinct. This may be one of the few times that the extinction of a species in the wild can be known to the exact day. Scientists will continue to search for the bat, but there has been no signs of the bat since.

Order theory

Order theory is a field of mathematics. It concerns itself with being able to compare different elements of a set. Given a binary relation it is then possible to put all the elements of the set in a certain order. It is also possible to say that a certain element "comes before" another one, for that relation. Another way to say this is to say that one of the two is "smaller than" the other.
For a specific set to be ordered it must be:
"reflexive: "each element of the set is within a relation with itself.
"anti-symmetric:" if A and B are in relation, and B is also in a relation with A, then A must be equal to B.
"transitive: "if A and B in a relation, and B is in a relation with C, then A and C must be in a relation.

<doc id="167617" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167617" title="Hermann Göring">
Hermann Göring

Hermann Wilhelm Göring (12 January 1893 in Rosenheim, Upper Bavaria, Bavaria, Germany – 15 October 1946 in Nuremberg, Middle Franconia, Bavaria, Germany) was a German politician and military leader of Germany. Between 1932 and 1945, he was President of the German Reichstag and also a minister of the Third Reich, under Adolf Hitler. In the Second World War, he was the Commander-in-Chief of the German air force. Göring was responsible for the creation of the concentration camps and the Gestapo, the official secret Nazi police, which he handed over to SS chief Heinrich Himmler. In 1941, he gave Reinhard Heydrich the order to arrange the Final Solution to kill millions of Jews.
Göring was one of the 25 people charged at the Nuremberg Trials. The court decided he was guilty. The judgment on 1 October 1946 said that he was to be hanged, but he killed himself by swallowing a tablet of cyanide a few hours before he could be executed.
Hermann Göring, son of Ernst Heinrich Göring and Franziska Göring (born Tiefenbrunn), was born in Rosenheim, Bavaria. Göring's father was a judge. The German chancellor Otto von Bismarck made Ernst Göring the first "Reichskommissar" (Governor-General) of "South West Africa" (today: Namibia), in 1885.
Hermann Göring had two brothers, Albert Göring and Karl Ernst Göring, and two sisters, Olga Therese Sophie Göring and Paula Elisabeth Rosa Göring.
He spent the first three years of his life at the home of a friend of his mother, because Göring's father was in Namibia. From 1901, he lived at his godfather Hermann von Epenstein's mansion. Hermann's mother had an affair (a romantic relationship with someone other than her husband) with von Epenstein. He attended the grammar schools in Fürth and Ansbach. In the games he played as a child, the story was always about war.
In 1905, he went to a military school in Karlsruhe. He got his Abitur, and an officer exam, in 1912. He then went to the Bavarian Prinz Wilhelm Regiment (112th Infantry) in Mulhouse.
When the First World War started, Göring had the rank of Lieutenant. He served in the infantry. In 1915, because of his rheumatism, he had to go to a hospital. His friend, Bruno Loerzer, got him to join the air force. In France, he flew as an observer, a person who looked for targets and enemy planes. Because of this, he was awarded the Iron Cross First Class in 1915. In 1916, he was trained to fly a plane. On 14 March 1916, he shot down his first bomber. In 1917, he became the leader of the 27 Flying Group. In 1918, after he shot his 19 plane, he was awarded the Pour le Mérite (also called "The Blue Max"). This was the highest airforce award in Germany. After the death of Manfred von Richthofen, he became the leader of the flying group "The Red Baron".
Between 1919 and 1921, Göring worked as a stunt pilot in Scandinavia. In November 1922, he met Adolf Hitler and became a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP). Göring married Carin in Stockholm on 3 February 1923. In 1923, he took part in the Beer Hall Putsch and was wounded. After this, he went to Austria. Because of pain, a doctor injected him with morphine but he became dependent on it. Between 1925 and 1926, he had two treatments in Sweden at the Långbro mental hospital. He came back to Germany in 1927. In 1928, he became a member of the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic. He was a member of the Reichstag until the end of the Second World War. In 1932, the NSDAP became the most powerful party of the Reichstag. Göring then became president of the Reichstag.
When Hitler became chancellor of the Third Reich in 1933, he made Göring a minister of the Reich without a specific area of responsibility. This means that he was not the head of a ministry. In April 1933, he was made minister president of Prussia. Then, on 30 August 1933, he was made a General by Paul von Hindenburg. Between 1934 and 1935 he became minister of several agencies. His wife had died in 1931, and in 1935 he married Emmy Sonnemann in Berlin. In 1936, he sent the German Condor Legion to Spain to help Francisco Franco. After the Kristallnacht in 1938, he was in charge of removing Jewish businessmen from the German economic system. During Second World War, his biggest defeat was the loss of the air battle against Great Britain. Hitler named Göring to be his successor if he died in 1939.
In 1940, he was made Reichsmarschall (Marshal of the Empire) by Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler. In 1941, Göring ordered Heydrich to make a plan for the Holocaust. In 1942, he gave Fritz Sauckel the order to use the Russian population for industry-work. In 1943, Göring had an expensive birthday party for his 50 birthday. On 20 April 1945, he left Hitler's birthday party and went to Berchtesgaden. He told Hitler that he had important things to do in south Germany. From Berchtesgaden, Göring sent a telegram to Hitler in Berlin. In the telegram Göring asked about taking over the affairs of state. Towards the end of the war, after the telegram, he started to talk with the Allies. Because of this, Hitler wanted to put Göring in prison. Göring then went to the Americans.
On 29 April 1945 Hitler removed Göring from all his offices, stripped him off his party membership and ordered his arrest. He wrote this down in his testament.
Göring surrendered in Bavaria on 9 May 1945. The Nuremberg Trials started on 20 November 1945. On 18 March 1946, Göring was questioned by the Allies. After this, he was imprisoned in Nuremberg. He was the third-highest-ranking Nazi official tried at Nuremberg. Only Reich President (former "Großadmiral") Karl Dönitz and former Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess had higher ranks than Göring. The judges decided he was guilty. Because of this on 1 October 1946 the court reached a verdict that he was to be hanged. One day before he was to be hanged, he committed suicide by taking a tablet of cyanide. It is not known how Göring got the cyanide or how long he hid it but there was a claim that he was given it by an American soldier who was in love with a German woman who was in touch with him. It is not known if this is the truth.

20000 Varuna is a big Kuiper belt object (KBO) and could be a dwarf planet. Before it was named Varuna, it had the provisional designation .
Varuna is named after the Hindu deity Varuṇa.
Varuna completes one rotation in about 3.17 hours (or 6.34 hours, depending on whether the light curve is single or double-peaked). Given the fast rotation, which is not common for objects so big, Varuna is thought to be a stretched spheroid, with a density around 1g/cm³ (close to the density of water). 
The surface of Varuna is somewhat red and small amounts of water ice have been found on its surface.

Howler monkey

Howler monkeys, genus "Alouatta", are one of the largest New World monkeys. There are 15 species. They are native to South and Central American forests.
These monkeys are famous for their loud howls, which can travel three miles (4.8 km) through dense forest. They are the loudest monkey and may be the loudest land animal. Group males call at dawn and dusk, and at times during the day. The function of howling may relate to intergroup spacing and territory protection.
These social primates live high in the trees (the canopy) of the rain forests of Central America, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Brazil, northern Argentina, and Bolivia. Howlers have a life span of about 20 years. They are in decline due to a loss of habitat.

Wristband

A wristband is a piece of clothing, plastic, metal or other material that is worn around the wrist of a person. There are different types of wristband such as those on watches and on the ends of the sleeves of a piece of clothing. Other types are the awareness bands and security bands used for music concerts and school dances.
There are many different types of wristband. Watches have wristbands that are often made of metal, plastic or leather. A metal wristband on a watch is often called a bracelet. A plastic or leather wristband on a watch is often called a .
Many people wear wristbands when they exercise or play sports to absorb sweat.
Hand Sweatbands 
In 2009 a new Sweatband was invented, primarily designed for runners, called a s"Q"oosh band. This groundbreaking design completely changed the look of sweatbands. Worn on the hand to precisely wipe sweat from the eyes and face, these bands join moisture wicking material to stretch terry cloth. s"Q"oosh brands revolutionized the old-fashioned sweatband market with a new favorite for runners in the 21st century. Similarly designed hand-sweatbands started appearing on the market in 2012.
Charities and awareness organizations often make wristbands that are sold to people so that the money can help people who are sick or need other help, and to help other people learn about their charity or awareness organization. Some bands are those made for; Make Poverty History, Anti-bullying, disease awareness charities and to help people learn about religions (such as the "Jesus Loves Me" band). These bands are often made of plastic or silicone. The making of some of these bands has been in the news as some were made in sweatshops in China and poor countries. This is said to be very bad because these wristbands are made to help people and charities and by being made in these sweatshops they have hurt the people making them because these places are often not safe, and the people working in them do not get paid much money for work they do.
Awareness wristbands were first started by the Lance Armstrong charity Livestrong (see "Other websites") in 2003.
Some of these wristbands are copied by criminals and sold to people without the money going to the organization they are trying to help.
Some awareness bands:
Wristbands are often used at music events like concerts and sports event to show that the person wearing them has paid to be there. Some events let people leave and return during the event. Security wristbands allow the person to come back in to the event after they have given their ticket to the staff the first time they entered.
Sometimes safety wristbands have been used to give to both a parent and child to make sure that only the parent can take the child home from an event. Both of their wristbands have the same number on them and this stops someone else from taking the child.
Hospitals also use wristbands on patients so that they know who they are because patients don't carry identification with them when they are in the hospital.
Some local governments have thought about using wristbands given to young people to let them buy alcohol in town pubs and bars.

Bullying

Bullying is when someone shows rude or mean behavior to another person. The people who do bullying are called bullies. Bullying is directed repeatedly towards specific and general targets or subjects. Bullying can be defined in many different ways depending on its context. Bullying doesn't have to be physical. It can be things that people say.
The subject of bullying includes picking on people that people see what happens but they don't do anything about it. When witnesses know what to do and they do it, the action becomes part of a process which makes a bad situation better.
Bullying is not only violence against the bullied person. It's also bullying when other people hide it from those in power (teachers, bosses), other people who see it ignore it, or when the bully is helped to get away with it. Bullying can also be saying mean words said to people face to face. 
School teachers and staff have tried to learn ways to stop bullying even when they do not see it themselves. They have learned that bullying can be easy to hide.
Some US states have laws against it.
Bullying can happen at school, work, at home, on the internet (cyber-bullying) or somewhere else.
A purpose is part of what makes bullying what it is. The process of bullying develops in many ways, including
Bullying may be a combination of one or more of these tactics (techniques). For example, Lance Armstrong explained "Yes, I was a bully. I was a bully in the sense that I tried to control the narrative and if I didn't like what someone said I turned on them." In other words, when someone said something Armstrong didn't like, "We ran over her, we bullied her."
Bullying behavior includes the misuse (harm) of power or position and making comments or threats about job security. The person that is getting bullied then feels insecure (not sure) about themselves.
Bullying also includes moving the goalposts by setting objectives which subtly change and cannot be defined or explained in ways that can be reached.
Bullying happens for a reason. The person is either not getting the attention they want or they are going through a family struggle and want to control someone else. Another possible reason, is that the person does not feel confident about themselves so they bully others to make themselves feel more powerful. Therefore, when the person that is the bully wants to get attention and show who's the best. They will start by saying mean things to students at school, that could possibly result in violence.
Many people wonder how to deal with bullying. Well the best thing to do is go tell a trusted adult or parent if the child is getting bullied. Somethings that may help when you face a bully is to thank them or smile to them. Instead of acting like something is wrong. Its good to be strong but if the bully tries to start a fight don't join them. Charities help anti-bullying.
There are also laws against bullying in the UK such as section 89 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006.0066177899?! B

Fire-stick farming

Fire-stick farming are words used by Australian archaeologist Rhys Jones in 1969. They describe the way that Indigenous Australians used fire regularly to burn the land. This helped hunting by herding the animals into particular areas, and also caused new grass to grow which attracted more animals. Over many years it changed the types of plants and animals that lived in an area.
Fire-stick farming had turned scrub into grassland, which increased the numbers of grass eating animals such as the kangaroo. Scientists say that the changes caused by fire-stick farming caused the extinction of the Australian megafauna.
In the forests, fire-stick farming opened up clear areas and let more plants grow at ground level. This increased the number of animals that could feed on these plants, such as the herbivore marsupials.

Miocene

The Miocene is the first epoch of the Neogene period of the Cainozoic. It started about 23 million years ago and ended about 5.33 million years ago. The rock beds that mark the start and end are well known, but the exact dates of the start and end of the period are uncertain. The biota becomes 'modern'. 
The Miocene was named by Sir Charles Lyell. Its name comes from the Greek words (', “less”) and (', “new”) and means "less recent", because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene. 
As the earth cooled, it went from the Oligocene epoch, through the Miocene, and into the Pliocene. The Miocene boundaries are not set at any particular world wide event. They are set at regional boundaries between the warmer Oligocene and the cooler Pliocene epochs.
The plants and animals of the Miocene were fairly modern. Modern families of mammals and birds existed. Whales, seals, and kelp spread. Modern sharks appeared, including the huge "Megalodon". Grasslands became more common. Mammalian browsers became less common, and grazer species became more common. About 100 species of ape lived at that time, and cetaceans were very common in the seas. The giganic shark "Carcharodon megalodon" may have preyed on them.

GPS-bsed navigation uses radio signals from special satellites that send their position and the time of transmission. The GPS receiver catches the signal and calculates the time. The GPS can then calculate the distance from the satellite with the well-known radio signal speed.
When driving a car with such a GPS receiver, the driver may receive information from a satellite which is above for instance Dover in the south and another one which is above Perth in the north. Then the GPS receiver knows precisely how far it is from Dover and how far it is from Perth. With that "two" possible positions of the car at the flat land are precisely determined.
To know which one of those positions is the right place, the GPS receiver needs a third satellite, for instance above Land's End in the west. With that information, the GPS receiver can also determine elevation. With three satellites in fact there is still a third possible point, but that is twice as high as the satellites above the earth's surface and does not need to be reckoned with in car travel.
But the GPS receiver still needs a fourth satellite, because the GPS receiver needs to know the time very precisely. In between it knows your car position, so that it can calculate the distance from that satellite. Then it knows the time of reception, because that is the time of transmission plus the travel time of the signal.
At any moment the GPS receiver searches for the strongest satellites, calculates the position and the driving direction and then shows it all on a small screen as a three-dimensional map. With that it also shows the vehicle's driving speed and how far it is to the next junction.
The driver may add the address where he or she wants to go. The GPS receiver then directs the driver to their destination step-by-step, often using voice prompts. The driver can even be shown where there are traffic jams, speed cameras and traffic lights, and the route can be calculated in such a way that these can be avoided, reducing the time needed for the driver to reach his or her destination.
If the driver deviates from the indicated route, the GPS receiver can provide new directions to the same destination, by repeating the same calculations.
To show where the car is with the calculated position, the GPS receiver contains digital maps. Many GPS receivers allow users to add more maps or newer maps to allow for better navigation.
Mobile phones are often equipped with GPS receivers, but most require a mobile Internet connection to function. Nokia's HERE Maps are able to store maps for offline use, and because of this, phones that have this app installed can be used as GPS navigation systems as mentioned above.

WWE Night of Champions

Night of Champions is a yearly professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event run by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).
The event started as a pay-per-view under the name Vengeance in 2001, replacing Armageddon for that year due to the possible insensitivity of the latter's name with respect to the September 11 attacks. In 2002, Vengeance took over Fully Loaded's pay-per-view spot. The 2003 event was belonged to the SmackDown! brand, while from 2004 to 2006, the events were Raw only. In 2005, Vengeance was moved again, this time changing positions with The Great American Bash.

<doc id="167867" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167867" title="Spiral">
Spiral

A Spiral is a special curve in mathematics. This curve starts at a point, and then goes around the point, but gets farther and farther away from it. This is different from a circle (which is always at the same distance or an ellipse. A spiral is an "open" curve, unlike circles and ellipses which are closed curves.
A two-dimensional spiral may be described most easily using polar coordinates. There the radius "r" is a continuous monotonic function of angle θ ("theta"). The circle would be regarded as a degenerate case. With the circle, the function would not be strictly monotonic, but constant.
Some of the more important sorts of two-dimensional spirals include:
For simple 3-d spirals, a third variable, "h" (height), is also a continuous, monotonic function of θ. For example, a conic helix may be defined as a spiral on a conic surface, with the distance to the apex an exponential function of θ.
The helix and vortex can be viewed as a kind of three-dimensional spiral.
For a helix with thickness, see spring (math).
The study of spirals in nature have a long history, Christopher Wren found out that many shells form a logarithmic spiral. Jan Swammerdam observed the common mathematical characteristics of a wide range of shells from "Helix" to "Spirula" and Henry Nottidge Moseley described the mathematics of univalve shells. D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson's "On Growth and Form" gives extensive treatment to these spirals. He describes how shells are formed by rotating a closed curve around a fixed axis, the shape of the curve remains fixed but its size grows in a geometric progression. In some shell such as "Nautilus" and ammonites the generating curve revolves in a plane pirpendicular to the axis and the shell will form a planer discoid shape. In others it follows a skew path forming a helico-spiral pattern.
Thompson also studied spirals occurring in horns, teeth, claws and plants.
Spirals in plants and animals are frequently described as whorls.
A model for the pattern of florets in the head of a sunflower was proposed by H Vogel. This has the form
where formula_2 is the index number of the floret and formula_3 is a constant scaling factor, and is a form of Fermat's spiral. The angle 137.5° is related to the golden ratio and gives a close packing of florets.
The spiral also represents infinity. Starting at a single point, and revolving outwardly until the end of the universe. Because of this, some civilizations believe that the Spiral is a pathway to the afterlife.
The spiral plays an important role in symbolism. It appears in megalithic art, notably in the Newgrange tomb or in many Galician petroglyphs such as the one in Mogor. See also triple spiral.
Scholars are still talking about the subject, but many of them now believe that the simple spiral in Chinese art may be a symbol of the sun. Roof tiles from the Tang Dynasty with this symbol have been found west of the ancient city of Chang'an (modern-day Xian).
The spiral is the most ancient symbol found on every civilized continent. Because it appears at burial sites across the globe, the spiral most likely represented the "life-death-rebirth" cycle. Similarly, the spiral symbolized the sun, as ancient people thought the sun was born each morning, died each night, and was reborn the next morning. 
Spirals are also a symbol of hypnosis. This most likely comes from the cliché of people and cartoon characters being hypnotized by staring into a spinning spiral (One example being Kaa in Disney's "The Jungle Book"). They are also used as a symbol of dizziness, where the eyes of a cartoon character, especially in anime and manga, will turn into spirals to show they are dizzy or dazed. The spiral is also a prominent symbol in the anime "Gurren Lagann", where it symbolizes the double helix structure of DNA, representing biological evolution, and the spiral structure of a galaxy, representing universal evolution.

Carmine (color)

Carmine is the general term for a particularly deep red color. Some rubies are colored the color shown in the color chart below as "rich carmine". The deep red color shown at right as "carmine" is the color of the raw unprocessed pigment, but lighter, richer, or brighter colors are produced when the raw pigment is processed, some of which are shown below.
The color carmine comes from the pigment "carmine", which is a deep red color obtained from the carminic acid produced by some scale insects, such as the cochineal and the Polish cochineal, and is used as a general term for a particularly deep red color. The pigment carmine is used in the manufacture of artificial flowers, paints, rouge, yogurt, cosmetics, food additives, and crimson ink.
The first recorded use of "carmine" as a color name in English was in 1523.

<doc id="167889" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167889" title="Taupe">
Taupe

Taupe refers to a dark grayish-brown color. The word "taupe" derives from the Latin name for the European Mole, "Talpa europaea". 
Originally, this referred only to the average color of the French mole, but like the colors pink and lavender, the name expanded (in the case of "taupe" beginning in the 1940s) to encompass a wide range of varying shades. It seems that this occurred because the color of the fur of the mole can itself be a wide range of shades, from gray through yellowish, brownish, and even purplish.
The first use of "taupe" as a color name in English was in the early 1800s (exact year is not known).

The gravitational constant, called G in physics equations, is an empirical physical constant. It is used to show the force between two objects caused by gravity. The gravitational constant appears in Newton's universal law of gravitation.
G is about 6.6738 x10-11N⋅m/kg, and is denoted by letter . 
It usually appears in Sir Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation, and in Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. It is also known as the universal gravitational constant, Newton's constant, and colloquially as Big G. It should not be confused with "small g" ("g"), which is the local gravitational field of the Earth (equivalent to the free-fall acceleration).

Victoria Cross

The Victoria Cross (VC) is the highest military medal given for bravery "in the face of the enemy" to members of the defence forces of Commonwealth countries, and former British Empire territories. It is the most important medal, more important than all other orders, decorations and medals. 
It may be given to a person of any rank in any service (army, navy or air force) or anyone working for the military. It is usually presented to the person, or a family member if they were killed, by the British monarch during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. It can be presented by the Governor-General for awards made by other Commonwealth countries. 
It is the joint highest medal for bravery in the United Kingdom with the George Cross, which is for bravery "not" in the face of the enemy. However, the VC is higher in the order of importance and would be worn first by a person who had been given both medals (which has not happened).
The VC was begun on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria for acts of bravery during the Crimean War. Since then, the medal has been given 1,356 times to 1,353 people. Only 13 medals, nine to members of the British Army, and four to the Australian Army have been presented since the Second World War.
Since 1990, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, have started their own versions of the VC. Because of this, the Victoria Cross is sometimes called the "British Victoria Cross" or the "Imperial Victoria Cross".
The list of living s of the Victoria Cross is small.

Pit (Kid Icarus)

Pit is based on Icarus and Eros (also known as Cupid), figures from Greek mythology. The clothes that he wears and the fact that he is an angel resembles Perseus, Bellerophon, and Hercules, the last also being an archer. His looks have changed very little over the years, having always included things that have to do with classical antiquity (such as the chiton and sandals). His weapon is the bow and arrow. In "Of Myths and Monsters", Pit first received a crown of laurel, as well as revealing his eye color, blue. In "Super Smash Bros. Brawl", Pit is seen wearing an exomis. On the official "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" website, it is said that Pit is an angel that cannot normally fly. Much like Samus Aran from the "Metroid" series and Link from "The Legend of Zelda (series)" series, Pit did not talk much in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, either.
As part of changing the character, the designers of "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" saw it fit to change his character design (looks) by combining parts of his looks from the promotional artworks of both Kid Icarus titles with new ideas. Pit now appears older than the child-age designs from older games and now has a more anime/manga-like appearance, although he still seems to have a childish voice in the Japanese version. In The English version of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, he has a deeper-sounding teenaged voice. Nintendo has described the redesign as "a giant leap forward in his evolution". It is also said on the "Smash Bros. Dojo" that one of Pit's color changes is black, a "Fallen Angel color" choice. This new look had became popular among most nintendo fans. It will be used for the upcoming Kid Icarus Uprising.

In brief, instead of using "simple" English, I suggest to you using English. If Simple becomes to be the controlled English language Wikipedia, it would be possible to make translation engines from such English to any other language. Articles translated from such Wikipedia would be the basis for the articles on other Wikipedias. It may be similar for other simple projects. -- () 00:02, 16 February 2009 (UTC)

I am asking for changing the policy from simple English, which is fuzzy, to more strict way of building sentences. If there is, for example, an one-clause-one-sentence rule without metaphors, we would be able to parse such sentences by machine. If we would be able to parse it by machine, we would be able to generate those sentences in other languages. -- () 00:04, 17 February 2009 (UTC)
There are less than 40 active editors here on seWP; and the majority of those are very busy fixing and growing mainspace. We don't have much time for new proposals very often (not many get approved) and for something like this we'd need to have some examples performed and see a real tangible benefit to the project as a whole for it to gain community consensus. I think that the lack of regular contributers chiming in on this discussion reflects this thought. If you can show us that this is the very best thing to do to help grow our project (and if auto-translation could work, I realize it could also bring us new articles from elsewhere), then it might be possible to convince people to accept it. 18:45, 17 February 2009 (UTC)

It seems to me that we agree that one thing needed to keep this WP running is to reach some workable definition of Simple, and help people to stick to it. I'll quote your last comment on a thread archived from the talk page:
I have another proposal:
If we provide a spellchecker for some Browsers to potential editors, all "nonsimple" words will be underlined in red, and users may act accordingly. I may send to you the sample list, if you ask me to. () 19:30, 15 February 2009 (UTC)
(<-) I have moved this to Simple talk, seems better there, for the moment. Some comments:
I still think our resulting wordlist should be about double the "2-2.5k" an intermediate learner knows. This is simply since we cannot say how much overlap there is between wordlists?-- () 10:31, 17 February 2009 (UTC)

Has anyone noticed that over the past few days, we've received an influx of users blocked indef on EN (, ) who have socked after being banned here. I think that it's because there's been word spread around on EN (which may have been inspired in part by the thread on EN's admin noticeboard started by ) that Simple is just a place where people blocked on EN can go and do whatever they want. What are everyone's thoughts? 21:05, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

Hi all. I have need for a quite a few fair-use images for articles I'm in the middle of writing. Unfortunatly commons: doesn't permit the upload of fair-use images and seWP doesn't allow the upload of images at all "(to the best of my knowledge)". So, therefore, the question is left as to what to do. Could someone give a suggestion? If not, could we start discussion on adding the ability to upoad images directly to seWP and allowing fair-use "(unless, of course it has already been discussed and decided)"?

It's not a simple word. How about "other meanings"? 
I come across this problem so often. What is the community's opinion of deleting pages like Carnegie Mellon University, Occupy and Puzzle quest, which have a little info, but, as I've written in deletion logs, "is better to start from scratch." I have tried cleaning pages like this, adding categories, the infobox, interwikis, and re-writing, but it would be easier to just delete the page and let the article be created properly. In my opinion, these type of pages don't help the project right now, especially because we have so much vandalism and it takes too much time to fix. Is deletion fine? 18:59, 23 February 2009 (UTC)
Hello,
Sometimes there are users that do not get along well with each other; while there are probably not many such cases, I think we should set up a panel to help them deal with their problems relating to each other. This would be similar to an Arbitration Committee like it exists on other Wikipedias. As this is very much about trust, I propose the panel to be made of:
In general, I think that it should be possible to appeal against the decisions of this committee, this should be doable at another such committee; hoever given the relatiobnnship to en, I dont think enwp abcom would be a good one.
Ideas? -- () 14:12, 14 February 2009 (UTC)
I think it is a good idea and should be implemented, but it should start out informal. Basically, anyone who wants to volunteer. More sensitive cases would be given to admins. 21:38, 18 February 2009 (UTC)
What does the community think of using wikileaks as a reliable source? The documents that they house are often secret or top-secret government documents (but may have a copyright issue). Comments? 03:55, 23 February 2009 (UTC)
Hello, I heard that the edits of IP-users on this project can be handled barely, so vandalism can slip through. I watched the recent changes here and I missed an extension what could be very helpfull here if vandalism needs to be prevented. The suggestion is to request for the extension "Marked as Patrolled". (This is not the same as Flagged revisions.) Marked as Patrolled makes sure that all the edits (of specified users) get a ! in the recent changes. If you watch the difference there is a button which you can press that you've checked the edit done. Other users who also check the recent changes can see that an edit is checked, so that there is no need for checking double/triple/etc the same edit each time. With this extension you can set the following:
This system is used on several projects, but most used on nl-Wikipedia (and sisterprojects). Here it works very fine to prevent vandalism. In the recent changes there is a button to select the not marked as patrolled only. Perhaps this is an idea to cope with vandalism and correcting it? Greetings - () 18:06, 23 February 2009 (UTC)

Zakarpattia Oblast

Zakarpattia Oblast (, translit. ; , translit. ; ; ; also referred to as the Transcarpathian Oblast, Transcarpathia, Zakarpattya, or historically Subcarpathian Rus) is an administrative oblast (province) in western Ukraine. Its administrative center is the city of Uzhhorod. Other major cities within the oblast include Mukachevo, Khust, Berehove and Chop which is home to railroad transport infrastructure.
Zakarpattia Oblast was formally established on January 22, 1946 after the annexation of Subcarpathian Rus lands to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. During the Ukrainian independence referendum held in 1991, Zakarpattia Oblast voters were given a separate option on whether or not they favored autonomy for the region. Although a large majority favored autonomy, it was not granted.
Zakarpattia Oblast is in the Carpathian Mountains landscape of western Ukraine, and is the only Ukrainian administrative division which borders upon four countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania. The Carpathian Mountains play a major part in the oblast's economy, making the region an important tourist and travel destination housing many ski and spa resorts.
The oblast is ranked 23rd by area and 17th by population. According to the 2001 Ukrainian Census, the population of Zakarpattia Oblast is 1,254,614. Excluding Ukrainians, this total includes people of many different nationalities of which Hungarians, Romanians and Rusyns constitute significant minorities in some of the province's cities, while in others, they form the majority of the population (as in the case of Berehove).
Zakarpattia Oblast has a total area of 12,800 km² and is in the Carpathian Mountains region of western Ukraine. It is the only Ukrainian oblast to have boundaries with four countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. On the West it borders the Prešov and Košice Regions of Slovakia and Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén and Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg Counties of Hungary, on the South—the Satu Mare and Maramureş Counties of Romania, on the East and Northeast—Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, and on the North—Lviv Oblast and the Subcarpathian Voivodeship of Poland.
Zakarpattia Oblast mostly consists of mountains and small hills covered with deciduous and coniferous forests, as well as alpine meadows. Mountains cover about 80% of the oblast's area, and cross from North-East to South-East. The Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians, part of which are within Zakarpattia Oblast, were recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007.
The largest rivers that flow through the oblast include the Tysa, Borzhava, and the Tereblia. The region's climate is moderate and continental with about 700-1000 millimetres of rainfall per year. The average temperature in summer is +21°С (70°F) and -4°С (25 °F) in winter. With a total height of , Hoverla, part of the Chornohora mountain range, is the tallest point in the oblast. The lowest point, 101 metres above sea level, is in the village of Ruski Heyevtsi in the Uzhhorodskyi Raion.
The four of the oblast's historical-cultural sites were nominated for the Seven Wonders of Ukraine competition in 2007: Palanok Castle, Museum upon the Chorna River, Mykhailiv Orthodox Church, and the Nevytsky Castle.
Zakarpattia was part of Kingdom of Hungary, later Austria-Hungary until the latter's demise at the end of World War I. This region was briefly part of the short-lived West Ukrainian National Republic in 1918 and occupied by Romania at end of that year. It was later recaptured by Hungary in the summer of 1919. Finally, it joined the newly formed Czechoslovakia as "Subcarpathian Rus", of which it formed one of the four main regions, the others being Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia.
During the World War II German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the southern part of the region was awarded to Hungary under the First Vienna Award in 1938. The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived Second Czecho-Slovak Republic. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on March 15, 1939 and the Slovak declaration of an independent state, Ruthenia declared its independence (Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.
During the German occupation of Hungary in 1944, almost the entire Jewish population was deported; few survived the Holocaust. When the Soviet Army crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President Edvard Beneš formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the Soviet Union. It was then incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as "Zakarpattia Oblast".
The province has a unique footnote in history as the only region in the former Soviet Union to have had an American governor: its first governor was Gregory Zatkovich, an American citizen who had earlier emigrated from the region and represented the Rusyn community in the U.S. Zatkovich was appointed governor by Czechoslovakia's first president, Tomáš Masaryk, in 1920 and served for about one year until he resigned over differences regarding the region's autonomy.
After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine held an independence referendum in which the residents of Zakarpattia were asked about the Zakarpattia Oblast Council's proposal for self rule. About 78% of the oblast's population voted in favor of autonomy, however, it was not granted. There were also propositions of separating from Ukraine to rejoin Czechoslovakia, but after Czechoslovakia's dissolution into the Czech Republic and Slovakia on January 1, 1993, these ideas have been rendered largely moot.
On October 25, 2008, delegates to the Congress Of Carpathian Ruthenians declared the formation of the Republic of Carpathian Ruthenia. The prosecutor’s office of Zakarpattia region has filed a case against Russian Orthodox Church priest Dmytro Sidor and Yevhen Zhupan, an Our Ukraine deputy of the Zakarpattia regional council and chairman of the People’s Council of Ruthenians, on charges of encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine.
Zakarpattia Oblast's local administration is controlled by the Zakarpattia Oblast Council ("rada"). The Chairman of the Council is Mykhailo Kichkovskyi, elected from the People's Union "Our Ukraine" party. Kichkovsky holds this position since his election in April 2006.
The Zakarpattia Oblast Rada consists of a total of 90 deputies. Based on the March 26, 2006 regional election results, the distribution of the council's mandates is as follows: 30 mandates for the People's Union "Our Ukraine;" 25 for the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc; 7 for the Lytvyn People's Bloc; 5 for the Party of Hungarians of Ukraine "KMKS;" 4 for the Democratic Party of Hungarians of Ukraine; and 4 for the Socialist Party of Ukraine.
The oblast's governor (currently Oleh Havashi) is appointed by the President of Ukraine.
Zakarpattia Oblast is administratively subdivided into 13 raions (districts), as well as 5 cities (municipalities) which are directly subordinate to the oblast government: Berehove, Chop, Khust, Mukachevo, and the administrative center of the oblast, Uzhhorod. There are a total of 7 cities, 19 towns, and more than 579 villages.
Zakarpattia Oblast can also be divided into four unofficial geographic-historic regions (counties): Ung, Bereg, Ugocsa, and Northern Maramuresh.
The following data incorporates the number of each type of administrative divisions of Zakarpattia Oblast:
There are 13 raions (districts) in the oblast:

The largest of these are Hungarians (12.1%), Romanians (2.6%), Russians (2.5%), Roma (1.1%), Slovaks (0.5%) and Germans (0.3%). The Ukrainian government does not recognize the Rusyn people living in that country as a distinct nationality but rather as an ethnic group of Ukrainians. About 10,100 people (0.8%) identify themselves as Rusyns according to the last census.
Their languages and culture are respected by the provision of education, clubs, etc. in their respective languages. Those who recognize Ukrainian as their native language total 81.0% of the population, Hungarian — 12.7%, Russian — 2.9%, Romanian — 2.6%, and Rusyn — 0.5% Residents in seven of Mukachivskyi Raion's villages have the option to learn the Hungarian language in a school or home school environment.
Zakarpattia is home to approximately 14,000 ethnic Roma (otherwise known as Gypsies), the largest population of Roma in Ukraine. The first Hungarian College in Ukraine is in Berehovo, the II. Rákoczi Ferenc College.
Zakarpattia Oblast's economy depends mostly on trans-border trade, vinery and forestry. The oblast is also home to a special economic zone.
The oblast's main industry includes woodworking. Other industries include food, light industry, and mechanical engineering. Segment of foodstuffs in the structure of ware production of national consumption is 45%. The total number of large industrial organisations is 319, compared to 733 small industrial organisations.

Night of Champions (2009)

Night of Champions (2009) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which took place on July 26, 2009 at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was the third annual event under the Night of Champions name and the ninth annual event under the Vengeance/Night of Champions chronology. Similar to the previous two events, the concept of the show was that every championship in the company would be defended. It featured talent from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands. Eight matches were contested on the card.
Night of Champions will have professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers from the "Raw", "Friday Night SmackDown", and "ECW on Sci Fi" brands. Wrestlers will play a villain or a hero. All wrestlers will be from WWE's Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands—a storyline division in which WWE employees are assigned to a television program of the same name.
The main rivalry from SmackDown for Night of Champions is between CM Punk and Jeff Hardy in their battle over the World Heavyweight Championship. One month before the show, at Extreme Rules, Punk used his guaranteed title match he earned by winning the Money in the Bank ladder match against Hardy; he beat him, and won the World Heavyweight title. The two had many confrontations about it which lead to The Bash and a match that saw Punk get disqualified for kicking the referee. Then, Hardy attacked Punk because Hardy thought Punk kicked the referee on purpose. On the July 2 episode of "Superstars" fans were told that Punk had suffered a storyline eye injury. Punk's reasoning to Hardy's accusation was that he kicked the referee on accident due to his inability to clearly see Jeff, who he was really trying to kick. To settle the dispute on to who the rightful champion was, SmackDown general manager, Theodore Long, announced another match between the two at Night of Champions, which was accepted by both competitors.
Raw will be represented by Randy Orton defending the WWE Championship. After beating Triple H at The Bash, Orton did not have a contender for the championship, so on the June 29 episode of "Raw", special guest host of the week, as well as onscreen matchmaker, Batista, said that the title would be defended at Night of Champions against the winner of a single-elimination tournament. The first two matches of the four-person tournament were that night with Triple H beating Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and John Cena beating The Miz (Mike Mizanin). Triple H and Cena wrestled each other the next week on "Raw", but Orton's allies, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase, interfered in the match, attacking both Cena and Triple H. Because of that, it was announced Orton would defend the title against both Triple H and Cena in a triple threat match.

Ezekiel Hart

Ezekiel Hart (; May 15, 1770 - September 16, 1843) was a Jewish Canadian businessman and politician, and the first Jew to be elected to public office in the British Empire.
He was born May 15, 1770 at Trois-Rivières, Quebec to Aaron Hart and Dorothea Judah.
Ezekiel Hart created a brewery with his brothers in Trois-Rivières and, on April 11, 1807 was elected to the "Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada". Because he was Jewish, he swore his oath on a Hebrew Bible, instead of a Christian Bible, and while wearing a kippah. At the time, British laws did not let Jews have important positions like these, and Hart was expelled from the assembly. He was elected again in 1808 and expelled again.
He did not run for public office again. He continued to live in Trois-Rivières where he was a successful businessman and well-respected member of the community. He served in the militia during the War of 1812 and became colonel in 1830.
He came from a very important and rich family. His father, Aaron Hart, was member of the British forces, and a well-known businessman in Canada. His brothers, Moses and Benjamin, were important businessmen at Trois-Rivières and Montreal. His cousin, Henry Judah, later became a member of the "Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada".
Ezekiel Hart died on September 16, 1843 at Trois-Rivières, at the age of 76.

Sampler (musical instrument)

A sampler is an electronic musical instrument that is similar to the synthesizer. What a sample does is that instead of creating sounds from scratch however, a sampler starts with more than one recording (or "samples") of different sounds added by the user, and then plays each back based on how the instrument is configured. Because these samples are usually stored in RAM, the information can be quickly accessed.

Solar cooker

A solar cooker is a device that uses sunlight for energy. They use no fuel and cost nothing to run. They also help slow deforestation and desertification. Another benefit to solar cooking is that unlike cooking with fire, Solar cookers don't pollute the air. Solar cookers are also sometimes used for cooking outside, especially when using fire is risky or there is no fuel. it is very useful . it is a renewable source of energy
Solar box cookers can be made of materials or be manufactured in a factory for sale. There are many kinds of solar box cookers, from small cardboard boxes, that can be used to cook a single meal, to wood and glass boxes built into the sunny side of a house. Although the solar cooker was invented by Horace de Saussure, a Swiss naturalist, as early as 1767, solar box cookers have only become popular since the 1970s. They are found in almost every country of the world.

Phonograph

The phonograph, also called the record player or gramophone, is an electronic device that plays recorded sound. It was the most common device for playing recorded music from the 1870s through the 1980s. It was invented by Thomas Edison. Early phonographs recorded sound on cylinders, in addition to playing sound.
The phonograph plays sounds from a vinyl record. The record is placed onto the turntable. The turntable spins the record while a lever with a small needle on the bottom scrapes in between the little grooves in the vinyl. When this happens, music is played. These modern machines do not record. They play records that were made in a factory.

Resaca Confederate Cemetery

Resaca Confederate Cemetery in Resaca, Georgia is home to over 400 confederate soldiers who died during the American Civil War, also known as the War Between the States. This particular cemetery is designated for the soldiers that fought in the Battle of Resaca which took place May 14 and 15, 1864. Although the battle lasted two days, there are only three graves where the death date is listed as May 15, 1864. The remaining graves are listed as May 14, 1864. There are 424 graves marked 'unknown'. 
After the battle, a family known as the Green family returned to their plantation and the sight that met them there was almost more than they could bear. The bodies of confederate soldiers were buried in crude makeshift graves all across the yard. Compelled by a since of respect to those who had fallen in action, Mary J. Green and her sister began collecting the bodies to bury properly. Though poverty was rampant the Green daughters wrote friends asking for any amount money they could give. Col. John Green gave his daughters 2.5 acres of land for use as a cemetery for these soldiers. With the money collected and the land provided, the Green daughters and their mother began work on what we now call the Resaca Confederate Cemetery.
The Resaca Confederate Cemetery was founded on October 25, 1866. This cemetery and one in Winchester, Virginia were both dedicated on the same day. Each group thinking that they were the first confederate cemetery.

Passive solar building design

In passive solar building design, windows, walls, and floors are made to collect, store, and distribute solar energy in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer. This is called passive solar design or climatic design because, unlike active solar heating systems, it doesn't involve
the use of mechanical and electrical devices.
The key to designing a passive solar home is to best take advantage of the local climate. Elements to be considered include window placement and glazing type, thermal insulation, thermal mass, and shading. Passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings, but existing buildings can be adapted or "retrofitted".

Renewable energy in developing countries

Most developing countries have good renewable energy resources, including solar energy, wind power, geothermal energy, and biomass. These can help developing countries reduce their dependence on oil and natural gas. Investments in renewables can be less expensive than fossil fuel energy systems.
Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries. In rural and remote areas, transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative.
Interest in renewable energies has increased in recent years due to environmental concerns about global warming and air pollution, reduced costs of renewable energy technologies, and improved efficiency and reliability.
Renewable energy projects in many developing countries contribute to poverty alleviation by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting.
Renewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools. Renewable energy for cooking and heating can reduce the time that children, spend out of school collecting fuel. In addition, the displacement of traditional fuels reduces the health problems from indoor air pollution produced by burning those fuels.
Renewable energy can also contribute to better health by providing energy to refrigerate medicine and sterilize medical equipment. It can also provide power for supplying the fresh water and sewerage services needed to reduce infectious disease.
Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. More than 30,000 small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya
annually. For an investment of as little as $100 for the panel and wiring, the PV system can be used to charge a car battery, which can then provide power to run a fluorescent lamp or a small television for a few hours a day. More Kenyans adopt solar power every year than make connections to the country’s electric grid.

Yom Kippur War

The Yom Kippur War (also known as the Ramadan War and the October War) was a war between Israel and a group of Arab countries led by Egypt and Syria. The war took place from October 6-24, 1973. The war began on the Jewish festival of Yom Kippur in 1973, and it happened during the Muslim month of Ramadan. The attack by Egypt and Syria was a surprise to Israel. Egypt's army entered the Sinai Peninsula, and Syria's army entered the Golan Heights.
The Sinai and the Golan Heights belonged to Egypt and Syria, but they were occupied by Israel since 1967 during the Six Day War. Syria's aim of the war was to liberate all of the Golan Heights using military means. However, Egypt's Anwar Sadat wanted to use the military to stir diplomatic talks. Sadat achieved this in his limited war.
During the first few days of the war, Egypt and Syria scored astounding victories. Israel was shocked by the attack and was on the verge of defeat. The first Israeli counterattacks failed against both Egypt and Syria. However, Israeli attacks later repelled the Syrian forces and pushed them back further into Syria. The IDF came 40 kilometres from Damascus, the capital of Syria. The Iraqi army joined the war with Syria and the Israeli army stopped advancing.
On the Egyptian front, Israel's attacks against Syria had served as a 'distraction' against the Egyptian offense. This allowed the Egyptian army to dig deeper into Sinai, around 12km, an extra 2km to the original 10km plan. Israel feared a massive military defeat and so called on America for aid. Initially, America refused so Israel threatened to use its nuclear weapons, this threat was enough to persuade President Richard Nixon to send aid to Israel. America conducted "Operation Nickel Grass", which gave Israel a resupply of 20 tons of military equipment and ammunition. This proved vital to Israel and it allowed Israel to continue fighting and claim a victory. Henry Kissinger, United State of Secretary at the time, later said to Israel, "America saved you during the Yom Kippur War."
The Western world expected Israel to win quickly against Egypt because of its better military. The Egyptian army crossed the Suez Canal on October 6 and destroyed the Israeli defenses and forts on the other side. Israel tried for the next few days to defeat the Egyptians and push them back behind the canal. However the Israelis could not push them back. The United States of America started sending ammunition and weapons to Israel using airplanes to help the Israeli army win the war in Operation Nickel Grass. Syria soon pleaded Egypt to attack Israel to lessen the pressure on it. On October 14, Egypt attacked again, trying to advance even more into the Sinai. Israel defeated the attack, and the Egyptians lost about 250 tanks. After this, the Israelis attacked again. After heavy fighting, they crossed the canal at its center, between two Egyptian armies. They advanced north and south. They kept moving south until the reached the city of Suez, and they trapped a large Egyptian force on the eastern side of the canal, in the Sinai. The Israelis tried to capture Suez, but they were defeated. They also failed to advance north. They reached an area 101 kilometers from Cairo, the capital of Egypt.
The United Nations passed a resolution in the security council that asked all the countries to bring a temporary stop to the war (called a 'ceasefire'). The Arab countries and Israel agreed. However the ceasefire failed when the Israeli army advanced south to reach Suez. After this, the Soviet leader, Leonid Brezhnev, said to the US president that if the US did not send troops that he would send Soviet troops to the area. This was believed to be a threat and the United States put their military on full nuclear alert. Because of this tension between the United States and the Soviets, Israel agreed to a ceasefire, and the war ended. It was the closest the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, had been to nuclear war (and World War III) since the Cuban Missile Crisis of the 1960s. 
The war ended on October 26, 1973. After the war, Egypt and Israel negotiated. They reached an agreement to separate their forces. The agreement led to Israel retreating behind the Suez Canal. The Egyptian forces stayed in the Sinai near the canal and did not retreat from the places they captured. There was a large distance between Egyptian and Israeli forces in the Sinai as part of the agreement.
Israel also held negotiations with Syria and agreed to withdraw from the places the captured in Syria, but they stayed in the Golan Heights. Egypt and Israel kept their negotiations, and in 1979 they signed the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty. The treaty brought peace between Israel and Egypt, and Israel retreated from the whole Sinai and returned it to Egypt. The treaty still holds to this day. In the war Israel was called the winner and the Arab countries were called the losers even though no real military victory was ever won; it was a military "stalemate" (where no one won and no one lost). However the war agreed to be a political victory for the Arabs, especially for Egypt. Syrians on the other hand do not like to talk about the war as much of it was seen as a defeat rather than a victory or stalemate.

Newton's method

Newton's method provides a way for finding the real zeros of a function. This algorithm is sometimes called the Newton–Raphson method, named after Sir Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson.
The method uses the derivative of the function in order to find its roots. An initial "guess value" for the location of the zero must be made. From this value, a new guess is calculated by this formula:
formula_1
Here x is the initial guess and x is the next guess. The function f (whose zero is being solved for) has the derivative f'.
By repeatedly applying this formula to the generated guesses (that is by setting the value of x to the formula's output and recomputing), the value of the guesses will approach a zero of the function.
Newton's method can be explained graphically by looking at intersections of tangent lines with the x-axis. First, a line tangent to the f at x is calculated. Next, the intersection between this tangent line and the x-axis is found. Finally, the x-position of this intersection is recorded as the next guess, x.
Newton's method can find a solution quickly if the guess value begins sufficiently near the desired root. However, when the initial guess value is not close, and depending on the function, Newton's method may find the answer slowly or not at all.

<doc id="168123" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=168123" title="Fahrenheit 451">
Fahrenheit 451

Fahrenheit 451 is an American dystopian fiction novel. It was written by Ray Bradbury and first published in 1953. 
The novel is about a future American society in which people are hedonistic (meaning they live only for pleasure), and reading is against the law because it makes them think. The main character, Guy Montag, has a job as a "fireman" (which, in this future, means "book burner"). The number "451" refers to the temperature (in Fahrenheit) at which the books burn when the "firemen" burn them "for the good of humanity". Written in the early years of the Cold War, the novel is a critique of what Bradbury saw as an increasingly dysfunctional American society.
The idea began with Bradbury's short story "Bright Phoenix," written in 1947 but first published in the "Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction" in 1963. The original short story was reworked into the novella, "The Fireman", and published in the February 1951 issue of "Galaxy Science Fiction". The novel was also serialized in the March, April, and May 1954 issues of "Playboy" magazine. Bradbury wrote the entire novel on a pay typewriter in the basement of UCLA's Powell library. His original idea in writing "Fahrenheit 451" was to show his great love for books and libraries. He has often referred to Montag as an allusion to himself.
Over the years, the novel has been subject to various interpretations, primarily focusing on the historical role of book burning in suppressing dissenting ideas. Bradbury has said that the novel is not about censorship; he says that "Fahrenheit 451" is a story about how television destroys interest in reading literature, which leads to people thinking that knowledge is made up of "factoids", partial information without context, such as Napoleon's birth date alone, without an indication of who he was. 
A movie version of the novel was released in 1966, and at least two BBC Radio 4 dramatizations have also been aired, both of which follow the book very closely.

Stack (data structure)

The stack is one of the most important data structures in computer science. To understand how a stack works, think of a deck of playing cards that is face down. We can only easily access the card that is on top. When we want to look at the top card, there are two things we can do: we can peek at it, but leave it on the stack, or we can pop it off. When we pop off the top object, we are taking it off the stack. If we want to add another card to the top of the stack, we push. 
A stack is called a last-in-first-out (LIFO) collection. This means that the last thing we added (pushed) is the first thing that gets pulled (popped) off. If the last card we put on our stack of cards was an ace, then the first card we pulled from the top is that same ace.
The stack was first proposed in 1955, and then patented in 1957, by the German Friedrich L. Bauer. The same concept was developed independently, at around the same time, by the Australian Charles Leonard Hamblin.
In modern computer languages, the stack is usually implemented with more operations than just "push" and "pop". Some implementations have a function which returns the current length of the stack. Another typical helper operation is "top" (also known as "peek"), which can return the current top element of the stack without removing it. Another common operation is "dup," which makes a copy of the element at the top of the stack.

A nocturnal emission or "wet dream" is when a boy or man has an orgasm while sleeping. Wet dreams can begin after a boy goes through puberty. Many young men have their first orgasm this way. They might not understand what has happened to them, if they have not been taught anything about sex.
Nocturnal emissions are called wet dreams because of the dampness caused by ejaculation and because the orgasm and ejaculation often happen during a sexually exciting dream. Scientists are not sure what causes them. Most sexual dreams "do not" cause orgasms.
Wet dreams are natural and harmless. They do not mean that anything is wrong with you. Many men stop having wet dreams if they masturbate often or once they begin having sexual intercourse on a regular basis.
If you urinate while asleep, this is called wetting the bed, not a wet dream.

Tevatron

The Tevatron was a giant Particle accelerator in Illinois that was used by scientists to make protons go very fast, almost the speed of light in some cases. Scientists looked at what happens when the protons hit antiprotons to see if they are right about their ideas as to what protons are made of.
The Tevatron was a circular particle accelerator at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (also known as Fermilab), just east of Batavia, Illinois. It was the second highest energy particle collider in the world after the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The Tevatron is a synchrotron that accelerates protons and antiprotons in a 6.28 km (3.90 miles) ring to energies of up to 1 TeV, hence its name. The Tevatron was completed in 1983 at a cost of $120 million ($ today) and has been regularly upgraded since then. (The 'Energy Doubler', as it was known then, produced its first accelerated beam — 512 GeV — on July 3, 1983.) The "Main Injector" was the most substantial addition, built over five years from 1994 at a cost of $290 million. The Tevatron was shut down on September 30, 2011.
The Large Hadron Collider was later built in Switzerland to look for one of those pieces, called the Higgs Boson. The LHC broke and is now being fixed. The Tevatron scientists also tried to find the Higgs Boson. They need to do this before the LHC is fixed, because the LHC is much better at finding things.
The scientists at the Tevatron had a year's headstart on the scientists at the LHC. Whoever finds the Higgs will be honored by other scientists. That is why the scientists at the Tevatron wanted to find it before the scientists at the LHC.
The Tevatron discovered three of the 17 fundamental particles including the top quark. The main ring of the Tevatron will probably be reused in future experiments, and its components may be transferred to other particle accelerators.

MOSFET

MOSFET stands for metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor. Transistors are small electrical devices that are used in, amongst other things, alarm clocks, calculators, and, perhaps most famously, computers; they are some of the most basic building blocks of modern electronics. A few MOSFETs amplify or process analog signals. Most are used in digital electronics. 
MOSFETs act like valves for electricity. They have one input connection (the "gate") which is used to control the flow of electricity between two other connections (the "source" and "drain"). Said another way, the gate acts as a switch that controls the two outputs. Think of a dimmable light switch: the knob itself selects 'ON', 'OFF', or somewhere in between, controlling the brightness of the light. Think of a MOSFET in place of the light switch: the switch itself is the "gate", the "source" is the power coming into the house, and the "drain" is the light bulb.
The name MOSFET describes the structure and the function of the transistor. MOS refers to the fact that a MOSFET is built by layering metal (the "gate") on oxide (an insulator which prevents the flow of electricity) on semiconductor (the "source" and "drain"). FET describes the action of the gate on the semiconductor. An electric signal is sent to the gate, which creates an electric field that alters the connection between the "source" and "drain".
Almost all MOSFETs are used in integrated circuits. As of 2008, it is possible to fit 2,000,000,000 transistors on a single integrated circuit. In 1970, that number was around 2,000.

Mathematical induction is a special way of proving a mathematical truth. It can be used to prove that something is true for all the natural numbers (all the positive whole numbers). The idea is that 
then
In the careful language of mathematics:
Because it's true for 1, then it is true for 1+1 (=2, by the induction step), then it is true for 2+1 (=3), then it is true for 3+1 (=4), and so on. 
An example of proof by induction:
Prove that for all natural numbers "n":
Proof: 
First, the statement can be written: for all natural numbers "n"
By induction on "n",
First, for "n"=1:
so this is true.
Next, assume that for some "n"="n" the statement is true. That is,:
Then for "n"="n"+1:
can be rewritten 
Since formula_12
Hence the proof is correct.
Mathematical induction is often stated with the starting value 0 (rather than 1). In fact, it will work just as well with a variety of starting values. Here is an example when the starting value is 3. 
The sum of the interior angles of a formula_1-sided polygon is formula_15degrees.
The initial starting value is 3, and the interior angles of a triangle is formula_16degrees. 
Assume that the interior angles of a formula_1-sided polygon is formula_15degrees. Add on a triangle which makes the figure a formula_5-sided polygon, and that increases the count of the angles by 180 degrees formula_20degrees. Proved.
There are a great many mathematical objects for which proofs by mathematical induction works. The technical term is a "well-ordered set".
The same idea can work to "define", as well as prove.

Polymerization

Polymerization is the process in which small molecules, called monomers, join chemically to produce a very large chain-like or network molecules, called a polymer. The monomer molecules may all be alike, or they may represent two, three, or more different compounds. Usually at least 100 monomer molecules must be combined to make a product that has certain unique physical properties—such as elasticity, high tensile strength, or the ability to form fibres—that differentiate polymers from substances composed of smaller and simpler molecules. Often, many thousands of monomer units are in a single molecule of a polymer. The formation of stable covalent chemical bonds between the monomers sets polymerization apart from other processes, such as crystallization, in which large numbers of molecules aggregate under the influence of weak intermolecular forces.
Alkene molecules can react with themselves, by adding polymerization to form 'plastic' or polymeric materials. When a catalyst (a substance that speeds up chemical processes) is added to the reaction, or it is heated under pressure, unsaturated alkenes link together, when the double bond partially breaks.
Uses of polymers: Polyethene- it is a cheap and useful plastic used for plastic bags and bottles, it is also very flexible and quite strong.

Portishead

"This article is about the town. For the band with the same name, see Portishead (band)."
Portishead is a town near the sea in North Somerset, England, where about 21000 people live (Local council update July 24, 2007). 
Portishead has had a history since Roman times. Its name comes from the words ‘port at the head of the river’. The town was built on the mouth of a small river; the main road in the town once met the water at the top of the river.
Lots of buildings in the town are of a Victorian style.
In the 1860s, in the middle of the iron and steel era, a pier and a dock were built for the big boats that could not easily get to Bristol Harbour. The ships brought in expensive items from around the world and took items made in the town to other countries. Many ships carried coal.
In the 1880s Portishead Dock was bought by Bristol Corporation, and was managed as part of the Port of Bristol until it closed.
The Portishead power stations were coal power stations built near the dock. The first power station was built in 1926. It began making electricity in 1929 for the Bristol Corporation. The power station was made bigger in 1948. 
A 2nd power station was started in 1949 and began making electricity in 1955.
After 1949, the power stations became part of the country's electricity industry. They used some local coal produced in the Somerset coalfield which was moved by train along the Portishead Railway. The line had opened on 12 April 1867 as the Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway Company; it opened to the dock on 5 July 1879. 
The 1st power station closed in 1976, and the 2nd closed in 1982. The dock was closed in 1992.
Portishead had two train stations for people who lived in the town. The main station was near the centre of Portishead, and the other was at the Pier. The construction of the 2nd power station caused the 1st train station to be removed and another station was opened in the main street of the town on 2 January 1954. The new station closed on 7 September 1964. People who live in Portishead now want the train station to be opened again.

Okashina Okashi

Okashina Okashi - Strange Candy is a webcomic drawn by Emily Snodgrass (Emi-chan) and written by Allison Brownlow (Tanzy), Karen Olympia (Kourin), and J. Baird (Xuanwu). It started in 2001, with Brownlow as its first writer and Olympia added to the team in October 2001. Snodgrass has appeared at conventions (large groups of people with a common interest), speaking as an amateur artist answering questions from an audience. Snodgrass is an amateur artist who does not earn a living from her online comic.
"Okashina Okashi" is hosted on Comic Genesis, a free online provider of webcomics. Baird used his comics while teaching for Hess Educational Organization, an English education business in the Republic of China and Singapore. He used "Okashina Okashi" in the "Create a Comic Project" when he volunteered to teach a free after-school youth literacy library event in New Haven, CT.
In August 2007, Emi-chan added a new comic set in the Beauty Man Garden, a chain of restaurants featured prominently throughout "Okashina Okashi". The new comic is called "Mini BMG".
A group of people who don't know each other are sucked into a different universe called UberTokyo. They must try to find a way home by using "plotholes" (holes in the air) to move between worlds. Each world is a parody of a kind of anime and manga, such as sports, sentai, and fantasy. The stories from beginning to present are:
In addition to these stories, there are many smaller stories. The longest small story has Kerisu, an evil overlord, who needs new servants and wants the main cast to replace them. Ho-chan and Daisuke, who were left behind in the sentai adventure world, have been seen again a number of times for their own small story. A third small story has Professor Li and his assistant Terra.
The comic features a large number of references to many anime and video games, such as Neon Genesis Evangelion, Revolutionary Girl Utena, and Guilty Gear. It also uses male homoeroticism as fanservice. One of its important male characters, Eeichi, is bisexual. Another male character, Takeshi, frequently cross dresses. Two less important female characters, Jen Puni and Zuga Ma, are hinted to be lesbians.

Adverse possession

Adverse possession is a rule in property law. This rule says that if property is not being used by its owner while another person is using the property, this other person (called an "adverse possessor") becomes the new owner of the property. To get these rights, the adverse possessor usually must use the property in the way a normal owner would do for a period of time, typically 20 years. In some jurisdictions, a form of adverse possession exists in which the adverse possessor ends up with sharing some rights to property with the owner, such as a right-of-way, instead of getting all the rights.

Rule against perpetuities

The Rule against Perpetuities is one of the most complicated rules in property law and wills and trusts. In general, the rule states that a gift of a will (or a trust) will not be enforced if the subject of the gift is to be given to a person who can not be known now, and will not be able to be known, by the end of 21 years after the death of everyone who was alive (including children in their mother's uterus but not yet born) at the time the gift was created. 
For example, if a woman says in her will that her house is to be given "to the children of her children when they graduate from college" this would be not be enforced by a court. It would not be enforced because one (or more) of her children's children might not graduate from college until 21 years after everyone who was alive at the time of the woman's death has died. 
The purpose of the rule is to prevent property from being tied up for "perpetuity" (a very long time). The courts (and many people in society) do not want to hold property to see who will receive it after a complicated set of rules from the gift-giver. First, this would result in a waste of the courts' time and resources. Second, it would be a waste of the property that is being given through the gift. If a gift in a will violates the Rule against Perpetuities, the court will simply strike that gift and transfer the subject of the gift as if the will had not mentioned it.
However, many countries and states have changed this rule, and it does not apply at all, or in a changed way, in those countries and states.

SS Nomadic

SS "Nomadic" is a steamship of the White Star Line, launched on 25 April 1911 in Belfast. She was built as a tender to the liners RMS "Olympic" and RMS "Titanic", and is the last remaining boat built for the White Star Line still afloat.
The keel of "Nomadic" was laid down in the Harland and Wolff shipyards, Belfast in 1910 (yard number 422). She was launched on 25 April 1911 and delivered to the White Star Line on the 27 May. The ship was 67 meters (220 ft) long and 11.3 meters (37 ft) wide, with a gross tonnage of 1,273 tons. She had two three-bladed screws, propelling her to a maximum speed of 12 knots.
With her sister ship SS "Traffic", "Nomadic" was used as a tender for "Titanic" and "Olympic" at Cherbourg in France. This meant she would ferry the passengers from Cherbourg to "Titanic" "Olympic" as they were too big to fit into the port at Cherbourg.
"Nomadic" was fitted with a luxurious interior and was used for the first and second class passengers, whilst "Traffic" served the third class travellers.
During World War I "Nomadic" saw service in carrying American troops at Brest (France).
In 1927, she was sold to Compagnie Cherbourghoise de Transbordement and then sold again to the Société Cherbourghoise de Remorquage et de Sauvetage in 1934. Then under the name "Ingenieur Minard", she again served as troop ship in World War II.
After the war she continued tendering Cunard White Star (White Star Lines and "Cunard" merged in 1934) ships until November 1968. She then served RMS "Queen Elizabeth" for the last time.
In 1974, "Nomadic" was bought by a private individual and converted into a restaurant on the Seine in Paris, where she remained docked and semi-abandoned after the closure of the restaurant, until she was moved to the port of Le Havre in 2003.
A public appeal for donations to return "Nomadic" to the Harland and Wolff shipyard for restoration was organised by Belfast Industrial Heritage (BIH), a non-profit organisation in Northern Ireland in collaboration with enthusiasts through the SaveNomadic.com Appeal.
On 26 January 2006, SS "Nomadic" was purchased at auction in Paris by the Department for Social Development, part of the Northern Ireland Office. She cost £171,320 (the reserve price being £165,000).
SS "Nomadic" left Le Havre to return to Belfast on 12 July, and arrived back close to where she was built on 18 July 2006. The vessel was welcomed back by the Social Development Minister David Hanson MP and the Deputy Lord Mayor of the City of Belfast, Councillor Ruth Patterson and a number of well wishers. The "Nomadic" arrived "piggy backed" on a marine transportation barge, which had been contracted from Anchor Marine Transportation Limited.
A study by Belfast City Council has estimated the cost of restoring "Nomadic" at £7 million. Belfast Harbour Commissioners have agreed to provide a temporary berth for the ship, and a charitable trust to co-ordinate fundraising for the restoration has been set up.
Now that the vessel is on the United Kingdom's National Register of Historic Vessels, the project should qualify for a National Lottery grant application, which should greatly enhance existing funds of £60,000 from a public appeal and £100,000 from Belfast City Council.
The Nomadic Appeal Public Website has now founded the Nomadic Preservation Society.
On her return to Belfast, SS "Nomadic" was moored at Queen's Quay just outside the Odyssey Arena in Belfast and opened with a temporary exhibition. In late 2008 the ship was closed to the public and moved to Barnett's Dock for internal maintenance. It is expected she will soon enter Hamilton Graving Dock for drydocking and complete restoration.
In January 2009, the company Frazer-Nash has been appointed to manage the Conservation Management Plan. The level of restoration will then be decided.
It is planned that the restoration of SS "Nomadic" will be completed in time for the 100th anniversary of the sinking of "Titanic" in 2012.

A testing dipstick is usually made of paper or cardboard. It contains substances which change colour when something is found in a liquid.
Measuring dipsticks show the amount of liquid in a container. These containers are usually hard to access. Measuring dipsticks are used by inserting and removing the stick and then checking how much of the stick is covered by the liquid. The oil level dipstick is an example of a measuring dipstick found on most internal combustion engines.

Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit

The Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit, also called the Stealth Bomber, is an American strategic bomber. It has a lot of stealth technology, and it is designed to get through many anti-aircraft defenses. It can drop both conventional and nuclear weapons. Two people fly the bomber, and it can drop up to 80 -class JDAM GPS-guided bombs, or sixteen B83 nuclear bombs. 
The bomber began being designed as the "Advanced Technology Bomber" (ATB) during the Carter administration. The designing of the ATB continued during the Reagan administration. The bomber was designed and is made by Northrop Grumman, with help from Boeing. Each aircraft cost US$737 million (in 1997 dollars). 
Because the bomber is very expensive, the project was controversial in the U.S. Congress. The end of the Cold War meant that the bomber was not really needed anymore. Congress wanted to buy 132 bombers, but during the late 1980s and 1990s, Congress reduced this to 21. In 2008, a B-2 was destroyed in a crash shortly after takeoff. The crew got out safely. 20 B-2s are being used by the United States Air Force. 
Although the B-2 was supposed to be a mainly nuclear bomber, it was first used in combat to drop normal bombs on Serbia during the Kosovo War in 1999. It was used during the Iraq War and it is being used in the war in Afghanistan.

Diapause

Diapause is a delay in development which has evolved in response to regular periods of adverse environmental conditions. 
It is a physiological state with very specific conditions. Diapause is a mechanism used as a means to survive predictable, unfavourable environmental conditions, such as temperature extremes, drought or reduced food availability. It is most often observed in arthropods, especially insects, and in the embryos of many of the oviparous species of fish in the order Cyprinodontiformes.
Not only is diapause started by specific stimuli or conditions, but once it is started, only certain other stimuli are capable of bringing the organism out of diapause. This distinguishes diapause from other forms of dormancy such as hibernation.
Activity levels of diapausing stages can vary considerably among species. Diapause may occur in a completely immobile stage, such as the pupae and eggs, or it may occur in very active stages that undergo extensive migrations, such as the adult Monarch butterfly, "Danaus plexippus". In cases where the insect remains active, feeding is reduced and reproductive development is slowed or halted.

More recently, audiobooks have been available to download from the internet (free or paid-for) and pre-recorded on special MP3 players.
While audiobooks can be used by anyone, they serve as a main resource for people who are blind or cannot see well.
Many popular books are often chosen to be turned into audiobooks. The original author may or may not be involved in choosing the narrator for the reading. Some authors often use the same reader for many books, so that their audiobooks have a similar sound or style.

The power spectrum of a signal is the power or more simply the energy of the signal at each frequency that it contains. It can also be considered as the range or spectra of energy or power of the given signal derived from the signals' range of frequencies.

Potato gun

A potato gun or Potato cannon is a type of cannon that uses combustion or air pressure to fire a projectile. They are called potato guns because potatoes are a commonly used projectile.
There are two main types of potato guns. Combustion guns use a flammable fuel and igniter to move an object. Another type uses compressed air. Potato guns are usually built of PVC or ABS (a type of plastic) piping.
Combustion potato guns have 4 parts. These are the barrel, combustion chamber, a cap, and an igniter.
A potato cannon can move a 2" diameter potato projectile over 100 yards at a speed of 40 mph. This makes potato guns dangerous.
A air powered potato cannon is much stronger than a combustion cannon. A combustion potato gun will launch projectiles at a pressure of about 10-20 psi. Air powered guns often use pressures over 100 psi.

Parsec

A parsec is a unit of distance used in astronomy. It is the distance that light travels in 3.26 years, or just under 31 trillion kilometres (about 19 trillion miles). This is from the definition: a parsec is the distance from the Sun to an object which has a parallax angle of one arcsecond.
Distances measured in fractions of a parsec usually involve objects within the same star system. 
Surveying provides an everyday example of parallax. Go outside and look at a distant object. Hold your hand out with one finger raised and close one eye. Line up your finger so it covers the object from view. Then close that eye and open the other without moving your arm. Now, move your finger to block that eye's line of sight. The two positions your finger was at can be used to find the distance from the object. This is what a survey crew does to figure out land plot boundaries. The mathematical technique used in the calculation is trigonometry.A parsec is so large that if you could see that far that you would be looking in to the past. You are looking 3.26 years in the past because it takes 3.26 years for the light to come from a parsec away.

The Legacy of Heorot is a science fiction novel written in 1987 by Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle and Steven Barnes.
This is the first book in the "Heorot" series. It is about a human space colony at the star Tau Ceti.
Hundreds of years in the future, people travel to the star Tau Ceti. It takes 100 years to fly there. To live that long the people go to sleep and freeze each other. When they get there they unfreeze, but some people do not wake up. Some people wake up but are not as smart as they were.
They land on the fourth planet from the sun and build a town on a big island. Everything is peaceful until they are attacked by a large animal. The animal is like a cross between a frog and an alligator. It is big but also "very" fast and smart. They call it a Grendel. The Grendel kills several people but then it is killed.
The people get very scared and build fences, land mines, and guns. After a while they get less scared and think that the Grendel they killed was the only one. They build boats and get brave. Then another bigger Grendel kills some of the people in the boats. The People trap and kill this Grendel.
The People get really mad. They find out that Grendels have to stay near water because when a Grendel moves fast it makes a lot of heat. If it does not cool off it will die. They go all around the island and kill all the Grendels. This makes them very happy.
They feel safe and travel all around the island. They notice that the alien fish are big now. They think that without the Grendels around there will be lots of fish to eat. This makes them happy.
Everything is good until the fish get very big. When they get big enough they grow legs, breath air, and move very fast. The fish are "baby Grendels". Now instead of a few big Grendels there are thousands of small ones.
Some people escape to the space ship. But, other stay to defend the town. They use the electric fences and land mines and guns to kill the little Grendels. After awhile the town gets too damaged to protect anymore. The people run away to a cave on a mountain. The Grendels follow them up a river and attack the cave. The people use kerosene to burn the Grendels. Also, they knock big rocks down onto them. After enough Grendels get killed, the other Grendels learn to run away instead of just attack. The people "win".
Over time the people hunt down all the new Grendels and all the alien fish. Finally they are safe.

University College London

University College London (UCL) is a large university in London. It is the largest college of the federal University of London. As well as undergraduate teaching, it is one of the largest research universities in the country.
UCL was founded in 1826 as 'University College'. It was the first university institution to be founded in London and the first in England to be established on an entirely secular (non-religious) basis. It admits students regardless of their religious beliefs. UCL was also the first admit women on equal terms with men. University College became one of the two founding colleges of the University of London in 1836.
UCL has over 100 departments, institutes and research centres in eight faculties. Its main campus is in the Bloomsbury area of central London. There are also a number of institutes and teaching hospitals elsewhere in central London. 
It has grown through mergers. These include the Institute of Neurology (in 1997), the Royal Free Hospital Medical School (in 1998), the Eastman Dental Institute (in 1999), the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (in 1999), the School of Pharmacy (in 2012) and the Institute of Education (in 2014).
The original University College was based largely on ideas of Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), a lawyer, social philosopher and free-thinker. Bentham believed in libertarianism, utilitarianism, women's suffrage, and the separation of church and state. These are beliefs of liberalism. The college was unique in that it was secular, and was called "that Godless institution in Gower Street".
University College was founded on 11 February 1826, under the name "London University", as a secular alternative to the strictly Anglican universities of Oxford and Cambridge. It was founded from the beginning as a university, not a college or institute. 
However, its founders got such strong opposition from the Church of England that it prevented them from getting the Royal Charter needed for the award of degrees. King's College London was specifically founded to provide an Anglican rival to UCL. It was not until 1836, when the latter-day University of London was established, that University College was legally recognised and granted the power to award degrees of the University of London.
UCL has over 7,000 academic and research staff and 980 professors, the highest number of any British university. There are currently 53 Fellows of the Royal Society, 51 Fellows of the British Academy, 15 Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering and 117 Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences amongst UCL academic and research staff.
UCL is a major centre for biomedical research; it is part of three of the 12 biomedical research centres established by the NHS in England and is a founding member of UCL Partners, the largest academic health science centre in Europe. 
For the period 1999 to 2009 it was the 13th most-cited university in the world (and the most-cited in Europe). There has been at least one Nobel Prize winner from UCL every decade since the establishment of the Nobel Prizes in 1901. There are 29 Nobel Prize winners and three Fields Medalists amongst UCL’s alumni and current and former staff, the most recent being Sir Charles Kao, who received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009. 
UCL is ranked 21st in the world (and 3rd in Europe) in the 2010 "Academic Ranking of World Universities", 4th in the world (and 2nd in Europe) in the 2010 "QS World University Rankings", and 22nd in the world (and 5th in Europe) in the 2010 "Times Higher Education World University Rankings".
UCL is a member of the G5, the League of European Research Universities, the Russell Group, and other national and international groups. It forms part of the 'Golden Triangle' of British universities.

Migraine

A migraine is a medical condition which usually causes a pounding, throbbing headache on one side of the head. The pain may be very bad and hurt so much that a person may have a hard time doing anything. While most people who have migraines get a headache, not everyone does. There are different kinds of migraines and some do not cause a headache but do have other symptoms.
Most migraines cause a headache and nausea and might make the person dizzy or very sensitive to bright lights or loud noises. Some people have "auras" before a migraine starts, which means their ability to see becomes different. They may see funny patterns, have blurry vision, or may not be able to see at all. Other senses can change before or during a migraine, and the person may sense funny smells or tastes. Migraines can last a long time. Most migraines only last about 4 hours. Some can last up to 72 hours.
Migraines have been classified, based on how often they happen in a month: If a person has a headache for less than fifteen days, the migraine is called "episodic migraine" (EM). If it happens more than fifteen days, it is called "chronic migraine" (CM). Chronic means it happens over a long amount of time. Some people who start off getting episodic migraines may start to get "chronic migraines" later. Chronic migraine then may "revert" or go back to episodic migraine. 
The exact causes of migraines are not known for sure. People used to believe that the main cause of migraines were unusual things in the blood vessels in the brain. However, now people believe that migraines start with a problem in the central nervous system. When this problem is triggered by various factors it sets off a cascade of neurological and biochemical reactions. Among these are reactions that disturb the "trigeminal nerve". This nerve is the largest nerve in the head (cranial nerve) and the blood vessels (vascular system) which supply blood to the brain. 
There are different risk factors which make a person more likely to have migraines. Being a female is a risk factor, and so is having family members who had migraines. For a person who has migraines, there are different trigger factors which may set off a migraine attack. In a large group of females who have migraines, one of the main trigger factors is when the amount of the hormone "estrogen" in their body either drops too low or "fluctuates" (goes up and down).
The World Health Organization says that migraine headache is the most costly brain problem for treatment and disability in the European Union and the United States.
"Childhood periodic syndromes" are a group of migraine syndromes that children may have. When a child has one of these child periodic syndromes there is a greater chance that they will get one of the other, more common types of migraines when they are adults. 
Abdominal migraine is a kind of migraine which causes a very bad pain in the area of the abdomen, usually around the 'belly-button' which is called the "periumbilical area". Abdominal migraine usually affects children starting at about age 7, but it may affect younger children and older children, and it may also sometimes affect adults.<br> 
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPVC for short): (this means harmless dizziness, that happens again and again and happens suddenly) is a medical condition which occurs in children usually starting between two and five years of age; it often disappears by the age of eight. BPVC causes vertigo. 
Cyclic vomiting syndrome or cyclical vomiting syndrome( CVS), is a medical condition whose main symptoms are nausea and repeated vomiting. CVS happens more often in children but it can occur at any age.
Episodic migraine (EM) is when a person has migraine symptoms for 14 days or less in one month, while chronic migraine (CM) is when a person has migraine symptoms for 15 or more days in one month. When compared to persons with episodic migraine those with CM where less likely to have full-time jobs and had a larger risk of headache-related disability.Persons with CM are almost twice as likely to have anxiety, chronic pain, and/or depression; they also have a 40% greater chance of having heart disease and angina and are 70% more likely to have a history of stroke.
About 7.68% of total migraine cases are chronic migraines and about 1% of people in the United States have CM, with a higher rate among females, middle-aged people, and in those households that had the lowest annual income. (The American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study)
Aura (from the Greek word for breeze) is the word used to describe a series of neurological symptoms that may begin before an epileptic seizure or a migraine headache. About 15% of people who have a migraine will have the kind with an aura. The symptoms may include visual problems such as "scotomas" (losing vision for a short time, seeing zig-zag lines or floating spots etc.), vertigo, a ringing noise in the ears (tinnitus) and problems speaking.
Scotoma (came from the Greek word for darkness: "skotos"): a "blind spot" or area of reduced vision surrounded by a normal visual field. i.e.: A person can see normally except where the scotoma is.Scotomas may affect one or both eyes and be either and be either "absolute" where nothing can be seen within the scotoma or, "relative" with some ability to see within the area of the scotoma. 
Scotomas may also have different patterns and shapes like the "fortification" scotoma; it is called fortification because it looks like the outline of an old fort. Scotomas can start of small and then get bigger, move around to different parts of a person's visual field, and they can also look like flickering lights. 
In medicine a "factor" is a substance, a condition or an activity, or a lack thereof that increases the chance of a certain outcome or condition happening. If it increases the chance of something unhealthy it is a "risk factor". A "trigger factor" or 'trigger' for short is a factor that may cause an activity or the signs and/or symptoms of a medical condition to begin.<br><br>
There are no specific tests to diagnose migraine but a doctor may use different tests to rule out other causes for a person's symptoms. The diagnosis of migraine is a "clinical diagnosis" which means it is based upon a person's "medical history" that a person reports to the doctor.The medical history for a possible migraine diagnosis which can be called the "headache history" includes information such as:
"Differential diagnoses" are different medical disorders which may cause the same symptoms. Before a doctor makes a "final diagnosis", which means they are sure of what medical disorder is causing the problem, they think of what other medical conditions have the same or almost the same symptoms, and make sure it's not one of them.
Often, having one medical condition makes it more likely a person will also have one or more other medical or psychiatric disorders. These other disorders are the "comorbid disorders" or "comorbidities". There are various comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions associated with migraines. The treatment and "prognosis" (if a disease gets better, worse or stays the same over time) of migraine is affected by the comorbid disorders which may be present and/or the chance of getting comorbid disorders.<br>
Comorbid psychiatric conditions
In medicine, a complication is a problem that happens because of, a procedure (like surgery), treatment (like medication), or illness (like migraines).
In medicine "epidemiology" is the study of what causes diseases and medical conditions, how often they happen, where they happen and who they happen to.
Migraine is more common among boys than girls until the beginning of puberty when girls start getting migraines more often than boys. By the later part of the teenage years girls get migraines almost twice as much as boys do. The amount of people who get migraines is highest between the ages of 25 to 55 years in both men and women, after which, the risk of getting migraines get lower as a person gets older. 
Between 65-75% of adult migraine sufferers are women and of these women, about two-thirds have menstrual migraines. Migraines are more common in people who make less money, there may be different reasons why such as stress.
About two-thirds of migraines are migraines without aura and the remaining one-third of cases are migraine with aura.
Symptoms that mimic those of migraines have been recorded in various cultures throughout written history. The first known mention was found on cuneiform tablets from Babylonia dating to 2000-1880 B.C.E.A treatment for migraine can be found in the "Ebers Papyrus", an Ancient Egyptian medical text named after George Ebers, the German Eygptologist who discovered them. In the ancient text dated to 1552 B.C.E. migraine is refereed to as "suffering in half the head". 
The Ancient Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia's description of a type of headache he dubbed "heterocrania" is considered a description of migraine.

Network bridge

A network bridge is a device which connects two parts of a network together at the data link layer (layer 2 of the OSI model). 
Network bridges work similarly to network switches, but the traffic is managed differently. A bridge will only send traffic from one side to the other if it is going to a destination on the other side. This is different to a layer 1 switch which sends all traffic from either side. Sometimes network bridges are called layer 2 switches. 
Since they need to look at the contents of the traffic going into them, they are much more complicated than a hub or repeater.
How is Bridge different to a switch?
Network Switches and Bridges are both Layer 2 devices. They operate at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI Reference Model. Network Switches and Bridges have many similarities and similar function. But Switches are considered as superior devices than bridges.
Following are the major differences between Network Switchs and Bridges.
• Packet forwarding in Bridges are performed using software. Packet forwarding in Switches are performed using ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits).
• Switches operate comparatively higher speeds that Bridges.
• Method of switching of a Bridge is store and forward. Method of switching of a Switch can be store and forward, cut-through or fragment-free.
• Normally a Switch has more ports than a Bridge.
• Bridges can operate only in half duplex mode, but a Switch can operate both in half duplex or full duplex mode.
• Both Bridge and Switch has one collision domain per port, but switches have one broadcast domain per VLAN.
• Switchs support full-duplex Local Area Network (LAN) communication.

Great Northern War

The Great Northern War (1700–1721), was a war fought between Sweden and the coalition of Russia, Saxony, Poland, and Denmark-Norway. In 1715 Prussia and Hannover joined the war against Sweden. The King of Hannover was also King George II of Great Britain.
After the coalition attacked them, Sweden invaded Russia in 1709 which was not a good idea. The Russian Army retreated so the Swedish Army had to chase them. When winter came it was the coldest winter that Europe had had in a hundred years and half of the Swedish soldiers died in the cold. Eventually the Swedish army caught up to the Russian army and they had a battle, called the battle of Poltava. Russia won the battle but most of the Swedish soldiers, including king Charles XII of Sweden, escaped and went to the Ottoman Empire. Peter didn't like this so he declard war on the Ottoman Empire. He lost and had to give the town of Azov back to the Ottomans.
Charles XII left the Ottoman Empire in 1714 and went to Stralsund in Pomerania which was owned by Sweden at the time but was under siege. Charles escaped back to Sweden just before the people in Stralsund surrendered. Then he invaded Norway (which was owned by Denmark at the time.) and was shot and killed there. With their king gone, the Swedish soldiers left Norway and went back to Sweden. On the way back many soldiers died.
When all that was happening Russia had been invading Sweden. Russia conquered Estonia, Livonia and Ingria. By the time the remaining soldiers had come back from Norway, Russia had completely conquered Finland. Sweden still didn't want peace though, because they would have to give lots of land to Russia. Russia used a newly made fleet of ships to attack and raid the Swedish Coast and Sweden would still not give up. Eventually the Russian and Swedish ships came together in the Battle of Grengam. Both sides thought they had won the battle so no treaty was signed until the Russians continued using their boats to damage the Swedish coast. Finally Sweden gave up in 1721. Sweden had made peace with Denmark in 1720 and in 1721 Sweden signed the treaty of Nystad.
In the Treaty of Nystad Sweden had to give land to other countries. Sweden had to give Estonia, Livonia and Ingria to Russia but could keep Finland. Sweden also signed other treaties. These were the treaty of Stockholm where Sweden gave Prussia Swedish Pomerania and the treaty of Fredericksborg where Sweden had to pay Denmark-Norway money for the damage the war had done.
This war was significant because it allowed Russia to become the dominant power in Northeastern Europe, instead of Sweden.

CentOS is a distribution (or "distro") of Linux that is made to be similar to Red Hat. It was first made because the company that made Red Hat stopped making it free. Now, many people work on CentOS, and many more people use it on their computers. Often, CentOS is used on servers (computers which provide services to people or other computers) because it is stable (does not break often) and can be installed (put on a computer) in not much time, compared to other distributions such as Gentoo.

Thermal conductivity

Thermal conductivity is the ability of a material to conduct heat. Metals are good at heat conduction. They are good conductors of heat. Gases are also good at moving heat. They are also good conductors of heat. 
Thermal resistivity is the opposite of thermal conductivity. This means not conducting heat much. Materials with high resistivity are called "thermal insulators" and are used in clothing to keep people warm or in refrigerators to keep things cold. 
Thermal conductivity is often represented by the Greek letter "kappa", formula_1. The units of thermal conductivity are watts per meter-kelvin. Watts are a measure of power, meters are a measure of length, and kelvins are a measure of temperature. From the units, we can see that thermal conductivity is a measure of how much power (in watts) moves through a distance (in meters) due to a temperature difference (in kelvin).
An example of thermal conductivity is when you put 2 spoons in boiling water. One spoon is steel and the other is silver. When you take the spoons out of the boiling water, the silver spoon is hotter than the steel spoon. The reason for this is that silver conducts heat better than steel.

A hydride is a compound with hydrogen bonded to other elements. Except for a few of the Noble gases, all of the elements in the periodic table can form hydrides. The properties of hydrides can be very different, but some of the hydrides have similar properties. 
"Ionic hydrides": compounds with ionic bonding. They are very reactive, making them difficult to dissolve. Most alkali metals and alkaline earth metals form ionic hydrides.
"Metallic" or "Interstitial hydrides": These have metallic properties like good electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity. They are called interstitial because hydrogen can enter the metallic lattice (framework of metal atoms). Metallic hydrides are mostly formed from the metals in the groups 3 to 5 of the periodic table. Some of these are used in the nickel metal-hydride battery.
"Covalent hydrides": These have covalent bonds between hydrogen and the other element. Most of the p-block elements form covalent hydrides. Many of these hydrides are unstable in air or water or when heated. Hydrocarbons are the hydrides of carbon, ammonia is a hydride of nitrogen, and water is a hydride of oxygen.

Hospice

A hospice is a type of medical treatment that helps take care of people who are very sick and have an illness that they will not be able to heal from. Many people staying in hospices have cancer or AIDS. People who stay in hospices are expected to die soon, but sometimes they get better. Hospices are different from other medicinal treatments because they mostly try to make people feel better instead of trying to cure them. Hospice tries to allow people to die with as little pain as possible.
Hospices have doctors, nurses, and other people who go to patients houses, nursing homes and hospitals to talk to people who want to use hospice medicine.
The Hospice movement was started in England in the 1950s by a nurse named Dame Cicely Saunders. The word Dame at the start of her name means that she did such good work starting hospices that the Queen of England made her a female knight.
A different nurse named Florence Wald brought hospice medicine to the United States because she worked with Dame Cicely Saunders and liked what she did.

Offa of Mercia

Offa was the King of Mercia from 757 until his death in July 796. 
Many historians regard Offa as the most powerful Anglo-Saxon king before Alfred the Great. Offa died in 796 and was succeeded by his son, Ecgfrith, who reigned for less than five months before Coenwulf of Mercia became king.
Offa was the son of Thingfrith, a descendant of Eowa of Mercia. Eowa was a king of Mercia who ruled along with his more famous brother Penda of Mercia. In 757 the king of Mercia,Athelbald, was murdered. There was a short civil war between others claiming the throne. An ealdorman named Beornred the throne of Mercia. But Offa drove him out of Mercia and became king himself that same year. The Athelbald had formed fell apart when Offa came to power. Offa had very little power outside of Mercia for the first several years of his reign. 
The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle makes no mention of Offa for the years between 757—777. No Mercian chronicles from this time period have survived. are the only records that give any idea of Offa's power outside of Mercia. But he proved to be ruthless, bold and creative in bringing Kent, Sussex and Essex under his control. Aethelbert the king of Kent was apparently under Offa's influence before he died in 762. In 794 another Aethelbert, a king in East Anglia was beheaded at Offa's command. When Egbert of Wessex made a bid for the throne of Wessex in 786 Offa had him banished from England. He made Beorhtric king of Wessex instead. Egbert was welcomed at the court of Charlemagne for at least three years. In charters Offa issued in Kent, East Anglia, Sussex and Middlesex he simply used the style "Rex Merciorum" (Latin for king of Mercia). Only in three church charters does he expand his title to indicate he is overlord of all of England. 
Offa had diplomatic relations with Charlemagne. He was one of the few Anglo-Saxon monarchs to have dealings with continental rulers. Letters and presents were exchanged. But when Offa sought a marriage of his son to one of Charlemagne's daughters, relations were quickly cut off. Charlemagne had all Frankish ports closed to British ships. Offa, very involved in church affairs, presided over church councils personally in 786-7. In 787 he convinced the pope to create the position of archbishop of Lichfield in Mercia. He wanted his own archbishop who was closer at hand than the Archbishop of Canterbury. He reorganized the of his kingdom. One of these defenses, Offa's Dyke was a massive earthworks between Mercia and the Welsh kingdoms to the west. Offa died in 796. His son, Ecgfrith, lasted only 141 days as king. Mercia was never again as powerful as it was during Offa's reign.

<doc id="168396" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=168396" title="Higgs boson">
Higgs boson

The Higgs boson (or Higgs particle) is a particle in the Standard Model of physics. In the 1960s Peter Higgs was the first person to express the idea. On 14 March 2013, scientists at CERN tentatively confirm that they have found the particle.
It is one of the 17 particles in the Standard Model. The Higgs particle is a boson. Bosons are thought to be particles which are responsible for all physical forces. Other known bosons are the photon, the W and Z bosons, and the gluon. Scientists do not yet know how to combine gravity with the Standard Model. 
The Higgs field is a fundamental field of crucial importance to particle physics theory. Unlike other known fields such as the electromagnetic field, the Higgs field takes a non-zero constant value almost everywhere. The question of the Higgs field's existence has been the last unverified part of the Standard Model of particle physics and, according to some, "the central problem in particle physics".
It is difficult to detect the Higgs Boson. Due to their massive size (compared with other particles) it needs vast amounts of energy to create them. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN was built mainly for this. It accelerates two sets of particles to almost light speed (travelling in opposite directions), before setting them on a path to collide with each other.
Each collision produces a flurry of new particles which are detected by detectors around the point where they collide. There is still only a very small chance, one in 10 billion, of a Higgs Boson appearing and being detected, so the LHC needs to smash together trillions of partials, and supercomputers need to sift through a massive amount of data to find the few collisions where evidence of the Higgs boson is.
Higgs bosons obey the conservation of energy law, which states that no energy is created or destroyed, but instead it is transferred. First, the energy starts out in the gauge boson that interacts with the Higgs field. This energy is in the form of kinetic energy as movement. After the gauge boson interacts with the Higgs field, it is slowed down. This slowing reduces the amount of kinetic energy in the gauge boson. However, this energy is not destroyed. Instead, the energy is converted into mass-energy, which is normal mass that comes from energy. The mass created is what we call a Higgs boson. The amount of mass created comes from Einstein's famous equation E=mc, which states that mass is equal to a large amount of energy (for example, 1 kg of mass is equivalent to almost 90 quadrillion joules of energy—the same amount of energy used by the entire world in roughly an hour and a quarter in 2008). Since the amount of mass-energy created by the Higgs field is equal to the amount of kinetic-energy that the gauge boson lost by being slowed, energy is conserved.
Higgs bosons are used in a variety of science fiction stories. The physicist Leon Lederman called it the "God particle" in 1993. He used this name to get attention and support for experiments to detect the particle. However, most scientists do not like this name, because the particle has nothing to do with any kind of god and the nickname might confuse people.
On 12 December 2011, the two teams at the Large Hadron Collider looking for the "Higgs Boson", ATLAS and CMS, announced that they had finally seen results which could suggest the "Higgs Boson" particle existed; however, they did not know for certain if this was true.
On 4 July 2012, the teams at the Large Hadron Collider declared that they had discovered a particle which they think is the Higgs boson.
On 14 March 2013 the teams had done much more testing, and announced that they now think the new particle was a Higgs boson.

Taylor series

A Taylor series is an idea used in computer science, calculus, and other kinds of higher-level mathematics. It is a series that is used to create an estimate (guess) of what a function looks like. There is also a special kind of Taylor series called a Maclaurin series.
The theory behind the Taylor series is that if a point is chosen on the coordinate plane (x- and y-axes), then it is possible to guess what a function will look like in the area around that point. This is done by taking the derivatives of the function and adding them all together. The idea is that it is possible to add the infinite number of derivatives and come up with a single finite sum.
In mathematics, a Taylor series shows a function as an infinite sum. The sum's terms are taken from the function's derivatives. Taylor series come from Taylor's theorem. 
The Ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea first came up with the idea of this series. The paradox called "Zeno's paradox" was the result. He believed that it would be impossible to add an infinite number of values and get a single finite value as a result.
Another Greek philosopher, Aristotle, came up with an answer to the philosophical question. It was Archimedes, however, who came up with a mathematical solution using his method of exhaustion. He was able to prove that when something is split up into an infinite number of tiny pieces, they will still add up to a single whole when all of them are added back together. The ancient Chinese mathematician Liu Hui proved the same thing several hundred years later.
The earliest known examples of the Taylor series are the work of Mādhava of Sañgamāgrama in India in the 1300s. Later Indian mathematicians wrote about his work with the trigonometric functions of sine, cosine, tangent, and arctangent. None of Mādhava's writings or records still exist today. Other mathematicians based their work on Mādhava's discoveries and worked more with these series until the 1500s.
James Gregory, a Scottish mathematician, worked in this area in the 1600s. Gregory studied the Taylor series and published several Maclaurin series. In 1715, Brook Taylor discovered a general method for applying the series to all functions. (All of the previous research showed how to apply the method to only specific functions.) Colin Maclaurin published a special case of the Taylor series in the 1700s. This series, which is based around zero, is called the "Maclaurin series".
A Taylor series can be used to describe any function "ƒ"("x") that is a smooth function (or, in mathematical terms, "infinitely differentiable.") The function "ƒ" can be either real or complex. The Taylor series is then used to describe what the function looks like in the neighborhood of some number "a".
This Taylor series, written as a power series, looks like:
This formula can also be written in sigma notation as:
Here "n"! is the factorial of "n". "ƒ"("a") is the "n"th derivative of "ƒ" at the point "a". formula_3 is a number in the function's domain. If the Taylor Series of a function is equal to that function, the function is called an "analytic function."
When formula_4, the function is called a Maclaurin series. The Maclaurin series written as a power series looks like:
When written in sigma notation, the Maclaurin series is:

Wilhelm Furtwängler

Wilhelm Furtwängler (born Berlin, 25 January 1886; died Baden-Baden, 30 November 1954) was a German conductor. He is thought of as one of the greatest conductors in history. Many people say that he is the best ever. The famous Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini said he was the world's best conductor other than himself.
Furtwängler was especially famous for conducting the music of famous German composers. His performances of Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, and Wagner are very well known and loved by many people.
Furtwängler was born on January, 25, 1886 in Berlin, Germany. He grew up in Munich, where his father was an archaeologist and professor. He started learning about music when he was very young. He learned to play the piano and was very talented. He also began writing music. He wrote several pieces before he was 20 years old. He kept writing music for the rest of his life, but his pieces never became very famous.
Furtwängler first started conducting as a young man. He wanted to conduct in order to perform his own music. However, he quickly became famous for conducting the music of others. The very first piece he conducted in public was the 9th Symphony of Bruckner. He conducted many orchestras before he finally became the leader of the world-famous Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in 1922. Later, he also had many other important conducting jobs. The most important was the director of the Bayreuth Festival, a very famous German music festival.
When the Nazis took over Germany in the 1930s, Furtwängler was in an awkward position. He wanted to conduct some kinds of music that the Nazis did not like. He left some of his conducting jobs in protest when they did not let him perform. In 1936 he almost left Germany to live in the United States, where the New York Philharmonic Orchestra wanted him to conduct. However, the Nazis still thought he was a good conductor, and they kept him in Germany. He also wanted to stay to protect the German music from the Nazis. People in the United States did not like him for staying, even though he did not really like the Nazis.
During World War II Furtwängler continued to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic. He gave many very famous concerts during this time. But towards the end of the war, the Nazis became unhappy with him. He fled from Germany in 1945 and lived in Switzerland for several years. He did not conduct again for two years.
After the war, Furtwängler was still in a difficult position. The Allies thought that he had been a Nazi supporter because he had stayed in Germany. They put him on trial, but finally decided he was innocent. He was allowed to go back to conducting in 1947. Even though he was innocent, people in the US still did not like him. He was going to conduct the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, but he was not allowed to because people got angry about it.
Furtwängler gave many successful concerts after the war. He still conducted the Berlin Philharmonic and other famous orchestras in Europe. Furtwängler gave the most famous concert of his career in 1951. That year, he conducted Beethoven's 9th Symphony at the Bayreuth Festival. It was the first time that the festival had happened since the end of the war, six years before. Many people say that this concert was the greatest musical concert in history. Furtwängler finally died in 1954, when he was 68 years old.
Furtwängler had a very unusual way of conducting. His movements with the baton were very awkward and jerky. Some people said he looked "like a puppet on a string" when he conducted. He liked to slow down and speed up the music very often. Furtwängler believed that there was more to music than just the notes on the score. He felt it was the performer's job to make each performance something special. This meant that he often played the same piece in very different ways at different concerts. Even when he changed the way he played a piece, though, the music was thought to be very beautiful. He did not like conductors who just played the notes on the page without doing anything special with the music.
As a younger conductor, Furtwängler played music by many different composers. However, as he got older, he usually only played music by the great German composers. Some of his favorites were Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, and Wagner.
Furtwängler did not make many recordings in studios. Recording technology was still very new at the time and did not work well for recording long classical pieces at first. However, many of Furtwängler's concerts were recorded, especially during and after World War II. Today people think these are some of the best recordings of all time. His famous concert at Bayreuth in 1951 is one of these concert recordings.

Endosymbiosis

Endosymbiosis occurs when a symbiont lives inside the body or the cells of another organism. It is a very widespread phenomenon in living things.
Examples are:
Endosymbiont theory is the idea that eukaryote cells arose in evolution by the fusion of previously free-living protists (prokaryotes). The theory was first suggested by the Russian botanist Mereshkovsky in 1905. The nature of lichens had been worked out; mitochondria and chloroplasts had been seen in cells, and their similarity to bacteria noted. The theory was initially dismissed, but was re-examined when more was known about cell biology. 
The eukaryote cell is the type of cell all animals and plants are made of. Some cell organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, contain DNA. In each case, this DNA is thought to be the remnant of the genome of a once independent bacterium. The theory is that the eukaryote cell evolved by the fusion of several bacteria or archaean organisms. Together, the new cells survived, prospered and evolved into new and complex forms of life. The origin of other organelles in the eukaryotic cell is still under review: the cell nucleus, its membrane, chromosomes and centromeres; the Golgi body; the flagella or cilia; the intracellular membranes. Some of these may also have had a symbiotic origin. 
Examples:
There is evidence that symbiosis happened between ancient bacteria to produce the double-membrane class known as gram-negative bacteria. Since the gram-negative bacteria include the cyanobacteria, this was the first of several such events in the history of the eukaryotes.

Tariff

A tariff is a tax charged on goods as they pass between one country and another. A tariff can be placed on goods being brought into the country (imports), and goods being exported from the country to another. It is usually done to make money for the government. It may also be done for protectionism. Protectionism makes it easier for local products to sell by making products from foreign countries more expensive.
Often, one government will have an agreement with another not to place any tariffs on goods that are traded between them. This kind of agreement is called free trade.

Klemens Wenzel von Metternich

Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich (German: Klemens Wenzel Nepomuk Lothar, Fürst von Metternich-Winneburg zu Beilstein) (May 15, 1773 – June 11, 1859) was an Austrian politician. He is thought of as one of the most important diplomats of all time. Metternich was Foreign Minister for Austria from 1809 until 1848. In this time, he got Austria out of a bad treaty with Napoleon that forced Austria to fight on the French side. Then he helped build a system in Europe that kept the peace for most of the next hundred years.
In 1809, when Metternich became Foreign Minister, Napoleon had control of most of Europe. France had taken over some of the closest countries directly. In more distant countries like Austria and Prussia Napoleon forced them to sign treaties saying they would fight on his side in wars. Metternich thought this was bad for Austria. When Napoleon declared war and raised a huge army for the French invasion of Russia, Metternich told the Russians that Austria would not attack, only defend. Napoleon lost badly in Russia, and Metternich used that chance to get out of the treaty.
In 1814, troops of the Quadruple Alliance (Prussia, Russia, Austria and Great Britain) had entered France, and Napoleon had lost the war. For the next year, diplomats from all over Europe met at the Congress of Vienna to decide how things were going to be now that Napoleon was gone. Metternich believed that the best way to keep Europe peaceful was to create a balance of power, which means that no country is strong enough to beat all the other countries. To make sure this happened, he made some countries stronger, so that other countries (especially France) would have to think twice about going to war. Some of these changes were that he added Belgium and Luxembourg to the Netherlands, he grouped over 300 small countries of Germany into a group of larger countries, and he grouped together some countries in what we call Italy today.
After making this new order, Metternich also did a lot to make sure it stayed that way. For example, he talked Czar Alexander I out of sending troops into Greece. Alexander wanted to send troops to Greece to protect Orthodox Christians there who were rebelling against the Muslim Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Empire was weak by that time, and Alexander would most likely have won. Metternich was afraid that if Russia attacked the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman Empire would fall apart, and all the powerful countries of Europe would start fighting to get the Ottoman Empire's land. This would mess up Metternich's balance. Also, he was afraid that Russia would get too big and be too powerful. So Metternich convinced the czar that if he attacked now, the Ottoman Empire would fall apart before the czar was ready to take it for himself, and that Great Britain and France would get most of it. And so Alexander agreed to try and keep the Ottoman Empire going, so that someday Russia could take all of it.
Metternich kept peace in Europe for a long time. But there were still some revolts in Europe, and finally in 1848 a bunch of revolts happened at the same time. One of them was in Austria, and the rebels had Metternich taken out of office. After he was gone, Otto von Bismarck, in Prussia, managed to get too powerful, and took over the German Confederation and made one big German country, which still exists today. Having one big Germany, though, messed up Metternich's balance, and helped cause World War I.

German Confederation

The German Confederation replaced the Holy Roman Empire in Central Europe. After the Holy Roman Empire fell, Germany had fallen into over 300 different small kingdoms. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna decided that these weak kingdoms were not strong enough to keep France from trying to take them over, which it had already done once under Napoleon. So the Congress combined all those little countries into 39 larger countries, which were still very small compared to the powerful countries of Europe. 
The problem was that the Congress did not want to make them too strong, or they'd start taking over other countries. So they put the 39 countries into a confederation which meant that they were all separate countries, but they agreed to help defend each other, and in some ways acted like one big country. But the Confederation was never strong enough to be able to attack another country. 
The German Confederation lasted until 1866, when the members fought each other. The winners formed a new North German Confederation. In 1871 after winning the Franco-Prussian War, Otto von Bismarck, chancellor of Prussia, combined all the countries of Germany into the German Empire.

Dendrite

Dendrites are the branches of neurons that receive signals from other neurons and pass the signals into the cell body (or soma).
A cell may have hundreds or thousands of dendrites, but may have only one axon. The dendrites carry signals from other neurons into the soma, whereas the axon carries a single signal from the soma to the next neuron or to a muscle fiber.
A dendrite from one neuron and an axon from another neuron meet at a synapse, which is a very narrow gap between the two cells. When electrical impulses (action potentials) reach the end of an axon, the signal must pass over a synapse again. There are two types of synapse: chemical or electrical. If it's a chemical synapse, the active potential triggers the release of special chemicals called neurotransmitters from the axon. These chemicals cross the synapse to the dendrite, where they trigger the flow of ions into or out of the cell.
The movement of the charged ions in the dendrite causes an electrical current, which spreads to the soma briefly before being restored to normal. If the current is positively charged, it will make the soma (which is normally negatively charged compared to its surroundings) become more positive. If the current is negatively charged, then it will make the soma even more negative. If a strong enough positive charge builds up in the soma quickly enough (caused by the dendrites receiving lots of signals from axons), then it will set off a chain reaction in a part of the soma called the axon hillock. The axon hillock is the place where the soma connects to the axon. The chain reaction that begins in the axon hillock is a strong electrical current called an action potential that flows down the axon to the next synapse.

The Sons of Eilaboun

The Sons of Eilaboun is a documentary movie by the Palestinian artist and movie maker Hisham Zreiq (Zrake). It was released in 20007. It tells the story of one of the massacres committed by the newly formed Israeli army during Operation Hiram. The massacres were committed in Eilaboun, a village in the northern Galilee between Nazareth and the Sea of Galilee. In the Eilabun massacre, fourteen men were killed, and twelve of them were executed. The village people were expelled to Lebanon and became refugees for a few months. The villagers eventually managed to return secretly.
The movie starts with Melia Zreiq (an old woman from Eilaboun) saying
“I hope God will bring peace to this land, and let the peoples live together - a good life. I hope there will be peace.”
Ilan pappe takes about Plan Dalet, a plan that David Ben-Gurion and the Haganah leaders in Palestine worked out during autumn 1947 to spring 1948, and explains the details of the plan, and how was it performed. In October 30th, 1948, the Israeli army entered Eilaboun at approximately 5 AM. They then forced the people of Eilaboun together in the main square of the village. They chose seventeen young men. Five of them were taken as human shield, and the rest of the twelve were killed, each in a different location. This all happened after the expulsion of the rest of the village to Lebanon, where they became refugees after a five days forced march to Lebanon. After a UN peace keeper observed and reported Israel was forced to allow the people back.
That same night, the Israeli army entered Eilaboun, a then Christian village in the northern Galilee between Nazareth and the sea of Galilee. Most of the villagers were hiding in the two village churches.
The soldiers ordered the people to gather in the village square, while going out of the Catholic Church the soldiers shot at the people killing an old man, making him the first victim. The soldiers chose seventeen men, and ordered the village to walk to Maghar, a village five kilometers to the north of Eilaboun. Shortly after the people left the village, the soldiers executed twelve of the young men, and five were taking to drive an army vehicle as human shields and later sent to a prisoners of war camp. The Israeli army had looted Eilaboun but left the houses.
When the villagers reached Maghar, the soldiers ordered them to continue to Kafr 'Inan, where the near Kafr Inan another man was killed, making the number of victims fourten. Kafr 'Inan and Eilaboun were both expelled to Farradiyya, a nearby village. The Israeli soldiers gathered the people of Eilaboun, Kafr 'Inan and Farradiyya (al-Farradiyya), looted the people and took all worthy. They spent the night in Farradiyya. In the morning the Israeli soldiers separated the women, children and the old from the men. The young men from the three villages were sent to prisoner of war camps. The women, children and the old of the three villages were marched to Mirun where they spent three nights without any food or water. At Mirun, the Israelis put everyone in two cattle trucks, and took them to Rmeish (in Lebanon). Kafr 'Inan and Farradiyya were later razed to the ground by the Israeli army.
About 52 villagers were left in the village, mainly old people and children. The priests complained about the expulsion of the villagers and demanded their return. Following a UN investigation and pressure activated by the Vatican, the villagers eventually managed to return clandestinely. After 6 months from the massacre most of the villagers managed to come back from Lebanon, and all the men were released from the prisoners of war camps.
The movie won the Al-Awda award in 2008, and was screened in many festivals and events as:

Mischief night

Mischief night is a tradition in some parts of the world; a night when people do mischief to their neighbours. This is usually 30 October, the day before Halloween.
Traditional mischiefs:
Sometimes combined with Trick or Treat.
In Detroit and other parts of Michigan, October 30 is called Devil's Night and includes vandalism and arson.
In northern New Jersey and the Philadelphia region, October 30 is referred to as "Mischief Night," where mischievous teens soap car windows, egg houses, adorn trees with toilet paper, and run away after ringing doorbells. In other parts of New Jersey, October 30 is also known as "Cabbage Night" or "Goosey Night." In Camden, New Jersey. Over 130 arsons were committed in that city on the night of October 30, 1991.
It is known as "Gate Night" in Trail, British Columbia, Winnipeg, Canada and as Mat Night in Quebec, Canada, always on the 30 October, the eve of Halloween. It is also commonly known as "Devil's Night" in many places throughout Canada.
In Yorkshire, it is also known as "mischievous night", "Miggy Night", "Tick-Tack Night", "Corn Night", "Trick Night" and "Micky Night". In Liverpool, it is known as "Mizzy Night"(but unlike in Yorkshire, where it is celebrated on October 30th). It was celebrated on Nov 4 in Merseyside during the 1970s, as well as in Manchester after the war.
Mischief night is becoming popular in Ireland, where teenagers get the week around Halloween off school. This means that many of the nights before 31 October are used by teenagers for vandalism.
Modern mischief includes toilet papering gardens and buildings, flouring and egging of cars, people, and homes, "forking" gardens, setting off fireworks and smashing pumpkins and jack-o'-lanterns. Local shops do not sell eggs to chavs around the time of Halloween. Sometimes the damage includes spray-painting of buildings and homes.
People play "Ding-Dong Ditch": in this 'game', people knock on doors and then run and hide.
A 2006 film Mischief Night is based on a night in Leeds, UK.

Dengue fever

Dengue fever (pronounced "DEN-gay") is an infectious disease caused by the dengue virus. People get the dengue virus from mosquitoes. Dengue fever is also called break-bone fever, because it can cause so much pain that people feel like their bones are breaking. 
Most people with dengue fever can get better just by drinking enough. However, a small number of people get dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. These are medical emergencies and can kill a person if they do not get medical treatment.
There is no vaccine that can keep people from getting the dengue virus. There is also no treatment or cure for dengue fever. Doctors can only provide "supportive care," which means they can only treat dengue's symptoms.
Since the 1960s, many more people have been getting dengue fever. Since World War II, dengue has become a problem around the world. It is common in more than 110 countries. Every year, between 50 million and 100 million people get dengue fever.
Most people who get the dengue virus (80%) have no symptoms, or have only mild symptoms (like a basic fever). About 5% of infected people (or 5 out of every 100) get much sicker. A small number of these people have symptoms that could kill them. 
After a person gets the dengue virus from a mosquito, it takes between 3 and 14 days for them to get sick. (This is called the virus's incubation period.) Most often, people start to feel sick after 4 to 7 days.
Often, when children have dengue fever, their symptoms are the same as gastroenteritis (stomach flu), like vomiting and diarrhea, or the common cold. However, children are more likely to have bad complications from dengue fever.
Dengue fever happens in three stages: febrile, critical, and recovery.
In the "febrile stage", people with dengue usually have a high fever. ("Febrile" means that a person has a fever.) The fever is often over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). Sometimes the fever gets better, and then comes back.
During the febrile stage, people may also have:
The febrile stage usually lasts 2 to 7 days. This stage ends when a person's high fever is gone.
In about 5% of people with dengue fever, the disease goes into a "critical stage" next. ("Critical" means "very dangerous.") The critical phase usually lasts 1 to 2 days. 
During this stage, plasma (the liquid part of blood) leaks out of the body's small blood vessels. The plasma can build up in the chest and abdomen. This is a serious problem for a few reasons.
Plasma carries blood cells, glucose (sugar), electrolytes (salts), and many other important things to the whole body. Every part of the body needs these things to survive. If too much plasma leaks out of the blood vessels, there will not be enough left to carry these things to the body's most important organs. Without these things, the organs cannot work normally. This is called dengue shock syndrome.
Plasma also carries platelets, which help the blood clot (they help stop bleeding). If a person does not have enough platelets, they can have dangerous bleeding. With dengue fever, this bleeding usually happens in the gastrointestinal tract. When a person has bleeding, leaking plasma, and not enough platelets, they have dengue hemorrhagic fever. ("Hemorrhage" means "dangerous bleeding.")
In the recovery stage, the plasma that leaked out of the blood vessels is taken back up into the bloodstream. This stage usually lasts 2 to 3 days. 
During this stage, people with dengue often feel much better. ("Recovery" means "getting better.") However, they can have very bad itching and a slow heart rate. 
Serious problems can also happen during the recovery stage. If a person's body takes too much fluid back up into the bloodstream, it can cause "fluid overload." This can cause fluid to build up in the lungs, which causes breathing problems. Fluid overload can also cause seizures or an altered mental status (changes in a person's thinking and behavior).
Every once in a while, dengue can affect other systems in the body. For example, dengue can cause:
Dengue fever is caused by the dengue virus. In the scientific system that classifies viruses, the dengue virus is part of the family "Flaviviridae" and the genus "Flavivirus". Other viruses that belong to the same family and can make humans sick include yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Most of these viruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
Dengue virus is spread mostly by mosquitoes from the "Aedes" genus, especially the "Aedes aegypti" species of mosquito. "Aides aegypti" is the most likely type of mosquito to spread dengue, because it likes to live close to humans and feed off of people instead of animals. A person can get the dengue virus from just one mosquito bite.
Sometimes, mosquitoes can also get dengue from humans. If a female mosquito bites someone with dengue, the mosquito may get the dengue virus from the person's blood. After about 8 to 10 days, the virus spreads to the mosquito's salivary glands, which make saliva (or "spit"). Now the mosquito will make saliva that is infected with the dengue virus. When the mosquito bites a human, its infected saliva goes into the human and can give that person dengue. 
A person can also get the dengue virus if they get a blood transfusion or organ donation from someone who has the virus. In some countries where dengue is common, like Singapore, between 1.6 and 6 blood transfusions out of every 10,000 spread dengue. 
The dengue virus can also be spread from a mother to her fetus during pregnancy, or when the child is born. This is called vertical transmission.
Dengue is usually not spread in any other ways.
Once a person gets the dengue virus from a mosquito, the virus attaches to and enters the person's white blood cells. (The white blood cells are part of the immune system, which defends the body by fighting off threats, like infections.) As the white blood cells move around the body, the virus makes copies of itself. The white blood cells react by making many special proteins, like interferon, which tell the immune system to work harder because there is a threat in the body. These proteins cause the fever, flu-like symptoms, and severe pains that happen with dengue.
If a person has a bad infection, the virus makes copies of itself much more quickly inside the body. Because there is a lot more of the virus, it can affect many more organs (like the liver and the bone marrow). The virus can stop the bone marrow from making platelets normally. This makes very bad bleeding much more likely to happen.
Babies and young children with dengue are more likely than adults to become very sick. Women are more likely than men to get very sick. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic (long-lasting) diseases, like diabetes and asthma.
There are four different types of the dengue virus. Once a person has had one type of the virus, he usually is protected from that type for the rest of his life. However, he will only be protected against the other three types of the virus for a short time. If he later gets one of those three types of the virus, he will be more likely to have serious problems, like dengue shock syndrome or dengue hemorrhagic fever.
Usually, doctors diagnose dengue by examining the infected person and realizing that their symptoms match dengue. However, when dengue is in its early stages, it can be difficult to tell the difference between this disease and other infections caused by viruses. 
The World Health Organization says that a person probably has dengue if:
The World Health Organization also says that in areas where dengue is common, any warning signs, plus a fever, usually signal that a person has dengue fever.
Some blood tests show changes when a person has dengue fever. The earliest change is a low number of white blood cells in the blood. A low number of platelets can also signal dengue. Special blood tests can look for the dengue virus itself; the virus's nucleic acids; or the antibodies that the immune system makes to fight off the virus. However, these special tests are expensive. Also, in many areas where dengue is common, most doctors and clinics do not have laboratories for blood tests or special machines.
It can be difficult to tell the difference between dengue fever and chikungunya. Chikungunya is a similar viral infection that has many of the same symptoms of dengue, and happens in the same parts of the world. Dengue can also have some of the same symptoms as other diseases, like malaria, leptospirosis, typhoid fever, and meningococcal disease. Often, before a person is diagnosed with dengue, their doctor will do tests to make sure they do not actually have one of these diseases instead.
In 1997, the World Health Organization (WHO) created a system for describing the different types of dengue fever. Eventually, the WHO decided that this old way of dividing dengue needed to be simpler. It also decided that not everyone with dengue fever fit into the old categories. 
In 2009, the WHO changed its system for classifying (dividing) dengue fever. However, the older system often is still used.
The WHO's old system divided dengue into three categories:
In 2009, the WHO created a simpler system which divided dengue fever into two types: 
There are no vaccines that can keep people from getting the dengue virus. The best ways to prevent dengue are to protect people from mosquito bites and to control the mosquito population.
The best way to control the "A. aegypti" mosquito is to get rid of its habitats (the places it lives). The best way to do this is to get rid of areas with standing water (water that does not move). Mosquitoes like standing water and often lay eggs there. Governments can use insecticides or biological control agents to control mosquitoes in these areas. People should empty out open containers of water (so that mosquitoes cannot lay eggs in them). To prevent getting bitten by mosquitoes, people can: 
The WHO suggests a program for preventing dengue (called an "Integrated Vector Control" program) that includes five different parts: 
There are no specific treatments for dengue fever. No known anti-viral medications (medicines which kill viruses) will kill the dengue virus. Health workers can give "supportive treatment" - treat dengue's symptoms to try to make patients feel better.
Different people need different treatments, depending on their symptoms. Some people can get better just by drinking fluids at home, and checking with their doctor to make sure they are getting better. 
Treating dehydration is very important. Sometimes, people are so dehydrated that they need intravenous fluids - fluids given through a needle placed into a vein. Usually, people only need intravenous fluids for a day or two.
Doctors can give medicines like acetaminophen (paracetamol) for fever and pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and aspirin should not be used because they make bleeding more likely. 
People with bad dengue may need blood transfusions. Having extra blood will help a person if their blood pressure is getting very low (like it does in dengue shock syndrome) or if they do not have enough red blood cells in their blood (because they are bleeding from dengue hemorrhagic fever).
When people reach the recovery stage of dengue, doctors usually stop giving intravenous fluids to prevent fluid overload (having too much fluid in the body). If a person gets fluid overload, doctors can give a type of medication called a diuretic, which will make the patient urinate out the extra fluid.
Most people with dengue recover and don't have any problems afterward. 
Without treatment, 1% to 5% of infected people (1 to 5 out of every 100) die from dengue. With good treatment, less than 1% die. However, 26% of people with severe dengue die.
Dengue is common in more than 110 countries. Every year, it infects 50 to 100 million people around the world. It also causes half a million hospitalizations and about 12,500 to 25,000 deaths around the world each year. However, the World Health Organization says that dengue fever is not taken as seriously as it should be. It calls dengue one of 16 "neglected tropical diseases" - diseases which do not get enough attention. In every million people, dengue causes about 1600 years of life to be lost. This is about the same as other tropical and deadly diseases, like tuberculosis. However, the WHO says the neglected tropical diseases, like dengue, do not get the attention and money that is needed to find treatments and cures.
Dengue is becoming much more common around the world. It is the most common viral disease that is spread by arthropods. In 2010, dengue was 30 times more common than it was in 1960. Scientists think dengue may be getting more common because:
Dengue happens most around the equator. 2.5 billion people live in areas where dengue happens. 70% of these people live in Asia and the Pacific. In the United States, 2.9% to 8% of people who come back from traveling in areas where dengue happens, and have a fever, were infected while traveling. In this group of people, dengue is the second most common infection to be diagnosed, after malaria.
Dengue fever is probably a very old disease. An ancient Chinese medical encyclopedia from the Jin Dynasty (which existed from 265 to 420 AD) talked about a person who probably had dengue. The book talked about a "water poison" that had to do with flying insects. 
Written records from the 17th century talk about what may have been epidemics of dengue (where the disease spread very quickly in a short time). The most likely early reports of dengue epidemics are from 1779 and 1780. These reports talk about an epidemic that spread across Asia, Africa, and North America. From that time until 1940, there were not many more epidemics.
In 1906, scientists proved that people were getting infections from "Aedes" mosquitoes. In 1907, scientists showed that a virus causes dengue. This was just the second disease that was shown to be caused by a virus. (The first was yellow fever.) John Burton Cleland and Joseph Franklin Siler kept studying the dengue virus, and figured out the basics of how the virus spreads.
Dengue began to spread much more quickly during and after World War II. Different types of dengue also spread to new areas. For the first time, people started to get dengue hemorrhagic fever. The first case of dengue hemorrhagic fever happened in the Philippines in 1953. By the 1970s, dengue hemorrhagic fever had become a major cause of death in children. It also spread to the Pacific and the Americas. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome were first reported in Central America and South America in 1981.
It is not clear where the word "dengue" came from. Some people think that it comes from the Swahili phrase "Ka-dinga pepo". This phrase talks about the disease being caused by an evil spirit. The Swahili word "dinga" is thought to come from the Spanish word "dengue", which means "careful." That word may have been used to describe a person having bone pain from dengue fever; that pain would make the person walk carefully. However, it is also possible that the Spanish word came from the Swahili word, and not the other way around.
Other people think that the name "dengue" comes from the West Indies. In the West Indies, slaves that had dengue were said to stand and walk like "a dandy." Because of this, the disease was also called "dandy fever."
The name "breakbone fever" was first used by Benjamin Rush, a doctor and United States "Founding Father." In 1789, Rush used the name "breakbone fever" in a report about the 1780 dengue outbreak in Philadelphia. In his official report, Rush mostly used the more formal name "bilious remitting fever". 
The term "dengue fever" was not commonly used until after 1828. Before that, different people used different names for the disease. For example, dengue was also called "breakheart fever" and "la dengue." Other names were also used for severe dengue: for example, "infectious thrombocytopenic purpura", "Philippine," "Thai," and "Singapore hemorrhagic fever."
Scientists keep doing research on ways to prevent and treat dengue. People are also working on controlling mosquitoes, creating a vaccine, and creating drugs to fight the virus.
Many simple things have been done to control mosquitoes. Some of these things have worked. For example, guppies ("Poecilia reticulata") or copepods can be put in standing water to eat the mosquito larvae (eggs).
Scientists also keep working on creating antiviral drugs to treat attacks of dengue fever and keep people from getting severe complications. They are also working on figuring out how the virus's proteins are structured. This may help them create medications that work well for dengue.

A portmanteau word is made of other words, or parts of words. It comes from putting two (or more) other words together, like "motel", from "motor" and "hotel".
"Portmanteau" originally meant a type of suitcase with two separate parts for storage.
The first use as a word combination appeared in Lewis Carroll's book "Through the Looking-Glass". There Humpty Dumpty explains that some of the unusual words in "Jabberwocky" are other words packed together into one word, as two parts of a portmanteau suitcase are packed together.
"Portmanteau" itself is an example, combining the French words for carry (porter) and coat (manteau) into a coat carrier. "Wikipedia" is a portmanteau of wiki (Hawaiian for fast) and encyclopedia.

<doc id="168627" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=168627" title="Lorentz factor">
Lorentz factor

The Lorentz Factor is the name of the factor by which time, length, and "relativistic mass" change for an object while that object is moving and is often written formula_1 (gamma). This number is determined by the object's speed in the following way:
Where v is the speed of the object and c is the speed of light (expressed in the same units as your speed). The quantity (v/c) is often labeled formula_3 (beta) and so the above equation can be rewritten:
Classical Relativity is the idea that if you throw a ball at 50 mph while running at 5 mph, the ball will now travel 55 mph. Of course, the ball still moves away from you at 50 mph, so if one were to ask you, you "saw" the ball traveling 50 mph. Meanwhile, your friend Bob saw that you happened to be running at 5 mph. He would say that the ball was traveling 55 mph. Both of you are right, you just happened to be moving "with" the ball.
The speed of light, c, is 670,616,629 mph. So if you are in a car traveling half the speed of light (0.5c) and you turn on your headlights, the light moves away from you at 1 c... or is it 1.5 c? It ends up that c is c no matter what. The next section explains why it's not c - 0.5c.
When a clock is in motion, it ticks slower by a (usually small) factor of formula_1. The famous twin paradox says that if there were two twins and twin A stayed on earth while twin B traveled near c for a few years, when twin B got back to earth, he would be many years younger than twin A (because he experienced less time). For example, if twin B left when he was 20 and traveled at .9c for 10 years, then we he got back to earth, twin B would be 30 (20 years + 10 years) and twin A would be almost 43:
Twin B would not notice that time had slowed at all. To him, if he looked out a window, it would seem like the universe was moving past him, and therefore slower (remember, to him, he's at rest). So time is relative.
Another way that the universe changes to make the speed of light not change is that it makes things shorter when they travel. During twin B's journey (see: Time Dilation), he would notice something strange about the universe. He would notice that it got shorter (contracted in the direction of his motion). And the factor by which things get shorter is formula_1.
Something called relativistic mass also increases. It does not actually make things heavier, it just makes them harder to push. So by the time you reach 0.9999c, you need a very big force to make you go faster. This makes it impossible for anything to reach the speed of light.
Still, if you travel a bit slower, say 90% of the speed of light, your mass only grows by 2.3 times. So, while it may be impossible to reach the speed of light, it may still be possible to get close to it—that is, if you have enough fuel.
The most significant consequence of these "relativistic effects" for humans is time dilation. If we were to build a space ship capable of traveling very close to the speed of light, the passengers of the ship could travel millions of light years in years or even months, measured with a clock on board the space ship. Because time is relative though, a clock on the observer would see the trip take millions of years.
But, if you travel a bit slower, say 90% of the speed of light, you would take 10% longer to get to your destination, but if a year passed for you, to an outside observer only three years would pass. 
The real big effects only take place after you achieve 99% of the speed of light. To get a 1 to 10 relativistic effect (1 year for you passing and 10 years for outside observers) you would need to go about 99% of the speed of light.
And if you wanted a thousand years to pass for an outside observer, while only one would pass for you on the space ship, you would need to be going at 99.9999% the speed of light. And of course your mass would increase a thousand times as well requiring you to carry a whole lot more fuel.

Cyperaceae

The family Cyperaceae, or the sedges, is a taxon of flowering plants that superficially resemble grasses or rushes. 
The family is large, with some 5,500 species described in about 109 genera. The largest is the "Carex" genus of "true sedges", with over 2,000 species. 
Sedges include many wild marsh and grassland plants, and some cultivated ones such as water chestnut ("Eleocharis dulcis") and papyrus sedge ("Cyperus papyrus"). These species are widely distributed, with many in tropical Asia and tropical South America. Sedges may be found growing in almost all environments. Many are wetlands, or have poor soils. Ecological communities dominated by sedges are known as sedgelands.
Features distinguishing members of the sedge family from grasses or rushes are stems with triangular cross-sections (with occasional exceptions) and leaves that are spirally arranged in three ranks (grasses have alternate leaves forming two ranks).

Objective-C

Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language used to make computer programs for OS X and iOS devices.
Objective-C was created in the early 1980s by two programmers named Brad Cox and Tom Love. It didn't become popular, however, until it was bought by NeXT in 1988 for their NeXTSTEP operating system. After NeXT was bought by Apple in 1996, it became the main programming language for Mac OS X and later the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad.
Objective-C is a strict superset of C, meaning that any code that can be written in C can be used in Objective-C programs without being rewriten. However, it adds some features of its own that cannot be used in a traditional C program.
In Objective-C, functions are called using messages, a feature inspired by the SmallTalk programming language. Messages look like "blocks" of code similar to the on shown below:
These blocks can be nested inside of each other as well, for example:
Unlike other programming languages such as C and [[Java(programming language)|Java]], Objective-C "classes" are divided into two separate parts: 
Usually, these are put in two different files, with the interface using the ".h" extension and the implementation using the ".m" extension.
Objective-C has variants that add features to the original Objective C programming language.
Objective-C++ allows for C++ code to be used in Objective-C applications.
Objective-C 2 is an improved version of Objective-C. It adds many features, such as garbage collection (automatic memory management), fast enumeration and properties (the automatic generation of variable methods).

Taser

A Taser is a weapon that is not meant to kill. Tasers use electricity to shock people so they fall on the ground. If a person is shot by a Taser, they feel like they are hurt and cannot move their arms and legs. Tasers are used by police officers to stop people who want to hurt them, and to stop people who are running away.
Tasers shoot two small pieces of metal called prongs. These prongs are connected to long pieces of metal string. When the Taser is shot, the prongs hit the person and electricity moves along the metal string to shock the person.
If a person is very close, the prongs do not have to shoot but they will still shock.
Even though a Taser is a weapon that is not meant to kill, the prongs can still hurt people. There are some times when people die after they are shot with a Taser. This is because some people get hurt differently by electricity.
In many places, people cannot own a Taser. There are special rules to follow to own a Taser. This is because it is considered a weapon. 
In Canada, France, Israel and the United Kingdom only police officers can have a Taser, but in the United States of America and Poland, most people can own a taser.

Wallpaper is a kind of paper used to cover walls inside of houses and buildings. Wallpaper is used to decorate the inside of buildings instead of paint. It is sold in rolls and are put onto a wall using wallpaper paste. Wallpapers can come either plain (so that it can be painted), or with pictures or patterns.
"Wallpaper" is also a word for a picture on a computer monitor.
Wallpaper was first used in Europe around the year 1500. Wallpaper was made to look like rugs that hang on walls because they were like pictures. Soon after people started making wallpaper, England and France started making a lot of wallpaper. For a while in 1650, wallpaper was not used because the religious leader in England did not like it. However, by 1750 people were using wallpaper all the time and more people got better at making wallpaper.
Water is the easiest way to get rid of wallpaper. Water makes the wallpaper paste become not sticky, then the wallpaper falls off.
Sometimes the wallpaper paste is too strong for water, then special chemicals need to be used to make the paste not sticky. Most of the time only new wallpaper has to be taken off with chemicals.
Really hot water makes it easier to remove wallpaper. There are special machines that people can use to make water into steam and use it to remove wallpaper.

Pumice

Pumice is a term for a lightweight volcanic rock. 
It is a solidified frothy lava, created when highly-heated, pressured molten rock is shot out from a volcano. Its light weight is due to air spaces, which are caused by fast cooling and loss of pressure. The loss of pressure makes bubbles by lowering the boiling point of the lava (like the bubble-creation when a carbonated drink is opened). The cooling then freezes the bubbles in the matrix.
Most famously, pumice stone has been used as a skin-scraper. It is used in pedicure to remove excess skin from the bottom of the foot, and on calluses (tough areas of skin). 
It has also been used to make lightweight blocks for building, and as a powdered ingredient in polishing.

"This article is about the mineral. For other uses, see Alabaster (disambiguation)"
Alabaster is a name applied to varieties of two distinct minerals. Gypsum is a hydrous sulfate of calcium, and calcite is a carbonate of calcium. Gypsum is the alabaster of the present day; calcite is generally the alabaster of the ancients. Both are easy to work. They are attractive to look at. Both have been used for making a variety of artworks and objects, especially small carvings.
The two kinds are easy to tell apart. One is harder than the other. Calcite is hard (Mohs hardness 3). Gypsum is soft (Mohs hardness 1.5 to 2). It can be easily scratched by a fingernail. Also, calcite effervesces when it is treated with hydrochloric acid. Gypsum does not.

Information security

Information security is about protecting information so that people who should not have access to it cannot distribute, see, change, or delete it. Although this has a lot in common with computer security, information risk management and information assurance, it is different from them. For example, computer security can focus on making sure that the computer is available when it is needed and that it works correctly but may not have anything to do with the data that it stores.
Information security has to do with the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data in any form e.g. electronic, print, or other forms. Organizations, including governments, private businesses and others have much information stored and processed on computers. Data that is lost or released to the wrong people or that is not properly secured could lead to legal and ethical problems for the organisation.
For an individual person, information security has a big effect on privacy, which is viewed very differently by people in different cultures.

Laminar flow

Laminar flow is characterized by the smooth flow of a liquid. This tends to happen at low velocities when there are few disturbances, such as in a straight, smooth pipe. In laminar flow through a pipe, it is assumed that the velocity of the fluid is zero at the boundaries of the pipe and is at a maximum in the center; mathematically, the velocity profile is parabolic. Microscopically, the particles or pieces of the liquid flow in a straight line along the direction of the pipe and do not mix with other layers of fluid. The layers slide past one another like playing cards. This is in contrast to turbulent flow, when a fluid swirls around.
Even though there is no mixing, there is still some friction in the flow. This friction will cause a pressure drop and its numerical value is given by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation.

Similarity (psychology)

Similarity in the area of cognitive psychology refers to things or ideas that people put together in the same groups, or categories, in their minds. Many psychologists try to find out what rules people use when they decide that two things are similar.
One important tool used by psychologists to look into similarity is computer modeling. Scientists will, for example, ask people to rate a number of objects as more or less similar to each other. Then they will write a computer program that tries to simulate the same answers that the humans gave. For instance, a person might say that "cat" and "dog" are similar words, so a good computer model should be able to take the word "dog" and respond with the word "cat" in a list of similar words. Computer models do this by applying some set of rules to a large collection of real world text (called a corpus).
Once a model can respond with the correct (similar) words, then it is likely that the rules the computer program uses are the same rules that people use to decide whether words are similar.
Another way that psychologists look into similarity is by putting people in special situations and watching what they do. In other words, by using an experiment. When it comes to similarity, this might include listing words, using categories as clues for learning new words, sorting objects into groups, or other tasks that have to do with comparing things to one another.
Depending on how quickly people do these tasks, or how many mistakes they make, psychologists can find out what rules they are using to decide if things are similar.

Capillary action

Capillary action means either of two things:
Capillary action is a result of the surface tension of liquids. 
An example of capillary action is what happens inside a drinking straw left in a cup of water. The force of adhesion which holds the water together and to the straw is a little stronger than gravity, so the water will rise inside the straw a little higher than the rest of the water.
Another example is what happens when putting a sponge in a puddle of water. The little bubbles in the sponge work like many straws gathered together. When the sponge is dipped in water, the water starts to go into the holes, and the bubbles that are inside the sponge pull on the water that they touch.
Capillary action also takes place inside the human body. For example, it removes tears from the eyes.

Jürgen Habermas

Jürgen Habermas was born on June 18, 1929. He is a German philosopher and sociologist, or someone who studies different societies. He uses a type of theory called critical theory, where he studies how people use power. He also uses the theory of American pragmatism, which studies if something is true or not by the effects of actions. He is known for his work on the theory of the public sphere. He studies power in democracy, and politics. He also studies how people develop a society through language, and tries to understand how that society and the government work together.
Habermas was born in Düsseldorf, North Rhine-WestphaliaGermany.
Habermas lived in Gummersbach, near the city of Cologne until his graduation from gymnasium. Ernst Habermas was his father and worked for the Cologne Chamber of Industry and Commerce, and he was a supporter of the Nazi's. Jürgen was raised in a Protestant religious family because his grandfather was in charge of the seminary, or religious school, in Gummersbach Germany. Jürgen Habermas went to the universities of Göttingen (1949/50), Zürich (1950/51), and Bonn (1951–54) and earned a doctorate, or an expert degree in philosophy from Bonn in 1954 with his work called, "" ("The absolute and history: on the contradiction in Schelling's thought"). The group who graded his work included Erich Rothacker and Oskar Becker.
From 1956 on, he studied philosophy and sociology under the critical theorists Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main Institute for Social Research, but because Horkheimer had asked Habermas to make some changes to his dissertation, or final project which Habermas did not want to do, and Habermas’s thought that the Frankfurt School was not correct in its views of modern culture, Habermas left the Frankfurt School and he finished his "habilitation", or highest academic degree, in political science at the University of Marburg under the Marxist Wolfgang Abendroth. His "habilitation" work was entitled, "" (published in English in 1989 titled "The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: an Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society"). In 1961, he became a "privatdozent" in Marburg, and he began working as a "extraordinary professor" (professor without chair) of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg (at the instigation of Hans-Georg Gadamer and Karl Löwith) in 1962. In 1964 Habermas returned to Frankfurt to take over Horkheimer's job in philosophy and sociology.
He was in charge of the Max Planck Institute in Starnberg (near Munich) in 1971, and worked there until 1983, two years after the publication of his magnum opus, or great work, "The Theory of Communicative Action" Habermas then returned to his chair at Frankfurt and became in charge of the Institute for Social Research. Since retiring from Frankfurt in 1993, Habermas has written many books and articles. In 1986, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the , which is the highest honour awarded in German research. He is a "Permanent Visiting" Professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and "Theodor Heuss Professor" at The New School, New York.
Habermas was awarded The Prince of Asturias Award in Social Sciences of 2003. Habermas was also the 2004 Kyoto Laureate in the Arts and Philosophy section. He traveled to San Diego and on March 5, 2005, as part of the University of San Diego's Kyoto Symposium, gave a speech entitled "The Public Role of Religion in Secular Context", regarding the history of separation of Church and State. He received the 2005 Holberg International Memorial Prize (about € 520,000).

Bhopal disaster

The Bhopal disaster or Bhopal gas tragedy was an industrial 
accident. It happened at a Union Carbide subsidiary pesticide plant in the city of Bhopal, India. On 3 December 1984, the plant released 42 tonnes of toxic methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas, exposing more than 500,000 people to toxic gases. 
A mixture of poisonous gases flooded the city, causing great panic as people woke up with a burning sensation in their lungs. Thousands died immediately from the effects of the gas. Many were trampled in the panic that followed. The first official immediate death toll was 2,259. Another estimate is that 8,000 died within two weeks, that an additional 8,000 have since died from gas-related diseases.
The Bhopal disaster is frequently cited as the world's worst industrial disaster. The International Medical Commission on Bhopal was established in 1993 to respond to the long term health effects of the disaster.
The plant in Bhopal where the disaster happened started to produce 'Carbaryl' in 1977. Carbaryl is mainly used as an insecticide. At first, the production was 2,500 tonnes per year. This was no problem, as the plant had been designed for an output of 5,000 tonnes. At the beginning of the 1980s, Carbaryl did not sell very well. For this reason, the owners of the plant started to cut costs. This included employing fewer people, doing maintenance less frequently and using parts that were made of lower-grade steel. Closing the plant was being considered as well. When the disaster happened, there was no production at the plant because there was a surplus on the market. 
The disaster happened because water entered a tank containing Methyl isocyanate. This caused a chemical reaction which resulted in the buildup of much Carbon dioxide, among other things. The resulting reaction increased the temperature inside the tank to reach over . The pressure was more than the tank was built to withstand. The tank had valves to control the pressure. These were triggered in an emergency, which reduced the pressure. As a result, large amounts of toxic gases were released into the environment. The pipes were rusty. The rust in the iron pipes made the reaction faster. All the contents of the tank were released within a period of about two hours. The water had entered the tank because of a sequence of events. The tank had been maintained badly. When cleaning work was done, water could enter the tank. 
There are different theories how water could enter the tank. At the time, workers were cleaning pipes with water. Some claim that because of bad maintenance and leaking valves, it was possible for the water to leak into tank 610. In December 1985 the New York Times reported that according to the plant managers the hypothesis of this route of entry of water was tested in the presence of official investigators and was found to be negative. UCC also maintains that this route was not possible, and that it was an act of sabotage by a "disgruntled worker" who introduced water directly into the tank. See also,http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/cbi-probe-into-gas-tragedy-baseless-and-malicious-says-counsel-of-indian-convict/story-cCzHAuxf6V6bA6vYFwFwPL.html
However, the company's investigation team found no evidence of the necessary connection.
The 1985 reports give a picture of what led to the disaster and how it developed. The reports differ in details, however. 
Factors leading to this huge gas leak include:
The problem was then made worse by the plant's location near a densely populated area, non-existent catastrophe plans and shortcomings in health care and socio-economic rehabilitation. Analysis shows that the parties responsible for the magnitude of the disaster are the two owners, Union Carbide Corporation and the Government of India, and to some extent, the Government of Madhya Pradesh.
Between 3,500 and 25,000 people died as a result of contact with the cloud of toxic gas. Up to 500,000 people were injured. Many of the injuries are permanent. Some of the chemicals lead to birth defects. The numbers vary so vastly because there are no exact figures about how many people lived in the neighbourhood of the plant. About 100.000 people were living in a radius of 1 km around the plant where the disaster happened.
In 1998, the Supreme Court of India reached a settlement with Union Carbide: They had to pay 470 million US dollars to the Indian state. At that time Union Carbide made a turnover of about 9.5 billion dollars, 20 times that amount. In return, there would be no further prosecution. Only very little money actually reached the victims. One of the reasons why many people are still suffering is that the terrain where the plant stands is still contaminated with mercury and other carcinogenic substances. Dow Chemical who owns Union Carbide refuses to decontaminate the soil. Greenpeace has estimated that decontamination would only cost around 30 million USD.

Dadaism is an artistic movement in modern art that started around World War I. Its purpose was to ridicule (poke fun at) the supposed meaninglessness of the modern world. Its peak was 1916 to 1922, and it influenced surrealism, pop art, and punk rock. It favored going against normal social actions.
Followers of Dadaism included Antonin Artaud, Max Ernst, and Salvador Dali. A later version, called "Neo-Dada", arose in the 1960s.

<doc id="168883" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=168883" title="Symbolism (art)">
Symbolism (art)

Symbolism was a late 19th-century art movement of French, Russian and Belgian origin. The movement rejected realism and naturalism, and included poetry and other arts. Symbolists believed that art should represent absolute truths that could only be described indirectly. Thus a symbolist painting may "look" realistic, but actually it represents a non-visual idea.
In literature, the style started with the publication "Les Fleurs du mal" ("The Flowers of Evil", 1857) by Charles Baudelaire. The works of Edgar Allan Poe, which Baudelaire admired greatly and translated into French, were a significant influence and the source of many stock tropes and images. The name "symbolist" itself was first used by the critic Jean Moréas, who invented it to distinguish the symbolists from similar styles of literature and art. Symbolism in art is related to the gothic component of Romanticism.
There were several groups of Symbolist painters and visual artists, including Gustave Moreau, Gustav Klimt, Odilon Redon, Henri Fantin-Latour, Gaston Bussière, Edvard Munch, Félicien Rops, and Jan Toorop. Symbolism in painting was even more widespread geographically than symbolism in poetry. Its ideas affected Mikhail Vrubel, Nicholas Roerich, Martiros Saryan, Mikhail Nesterov, Léon Bakst, Elena Gorokhova in Russia, as well as Frida Kahlo in Mexico and David Chetlahe Paladin in the United States. Auguste Rodin is sometimes considered a symbolist sculptor.
The symbolist painters used mythological and dream imagery. The symbols used by symbolism are not the familiar emblems of mainstream iconography but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, symbolism in painting influenced the contemporary Art Nouveau style and Les Nabis.

Meritocracy

A meritocracy is the condition where people who deserve to can go up in rank, as opposed to a system like nepotism. It applies generally to all positions to which people may be appointed. It is often reinforced by laws, such as that women should have equal opportunities to men in employment.
The philosopher Plato thought that a government based on merit was better than democracy. In democracy, there is no guarantee that you will get the best person, the most qualified person, ruling the state. His criticisms were really of Athenian (or direct) democracy, where anyone could be selected to rule.
In a meritocracy, the people are chosen who are thought to be the best. Some have accused it of being elitist, saying that government by the best will mean that only those who have had the right opportunities will have a chance to govern, creating in effect a ruling class.
It is worth pointing out that Plato did not see it this way. He believed that philosophers were the best people to rule because they were "disinterested", meaning they only had the interests of the state in mind, not their own interest. Plato's point was this: if you want to rule, then it will go wrong, because power will corrupt you. If you are a philosopher, you don't care about power all you care about is truth, so you will rule well, without being interested in your power or status.

<doc id="168907" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=168907" title="Nepotism">
Nepotism

Nepotism is when a person in authority gives jobs to their relatives. It comes from the practice of mediaeval Popes, appointing their nephews to important positions. "Nepote" is Italian for 'nephew'.
For instance, Pope Callixtus III, head of the Borgia family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming Pope Alexander VI. Alexander then elevated Alessandro Farnese, his mistress's brother, to cardinal; Farnese would later go on to become Pope Paul III. Paul III was a notorious nepotist. When elected Pope in 1534 he appointed two nephews, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals. 
The practice was finally ended when Pope Innocent XII issued the bull "Romanum decet Pontificem", in 1692. The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal.
In the modern world, nepotism is thought to be wrong, and conflicts with the principle of merit, where the best person gets the job (meritocracy). The argument against the widespread nepotism in countries like Italy is that it damages the economy of the country, though that is difficult to prove.

Pennsylvania State University

Pennsylvania State University is a college in the state of Pennsylvania. The main campus is in the city of State College, Pennsylvania and it has branch campuses around the state. It was founded in 1855. In 1863, the Pennsylvania state legislature picked the school to be the state's only land grant college. Its purpose is to do teaching, research, and public service. It teaches undergraduate, graduate, professional and continuing education students both in classrooms and online.
Penn State University Park is ranked among the top-fifteen public universities in the United States. Annual enrollment at the main campus totals more than 44,000 graduate and undergraduate students, making it one of the largest universities in the United States. It has the world's largest dues-paying alumni association.
The university's total enrollment in 2009–10 was approximately 94,300 across its 24 campuses and online through its World Campus. The university offers more than 160 majors among all its campuses Penn State has a US$1.52 billion (as of April 30, 2010) endowment. The university's research budget was more than $765 million for the 2009-2009 fiscal year. In fiscal year 2008, the National Science Foundation ranked Penn State 11th among U.S. universities in research income.
Penn State is a school known for its football team. Penn State is a member of the Big Ten Conference.
Penn State is a "state-related" university, part of Pennsylvania's Commonwealth System of Higher Education. It receives money from the Commonwealth. The state appoints 10 out of 32 people on its board of trustees. Penn State is independent and not subject to the state's direct control. For the 2006–2007 fiscal year, the university received 9.7 percent of its budget from state appropriations, the lowest of the four state-related institutions in Pennsylvania. As Pennsylvania's land grant college, the state and federal governments provide matching funds for research and cooperative extension in agriculture, home economics and related fields.
The board of trustees selects a president of the University. The president controls the university, including day-to-day management. In practice, the president gives power to other departments of the administration, to the faculty, and to the student body. Provost Rodney Erickson became interim President on November 9, 2011, after President Graham Spanier was fired.
The executive vice president and provost is the chief academic officer of the University. As of 2011, the provost is Rodney Erickson, and the Associate Vice President and Senior Associate Dean For Undergraduate Education is Jeremy Cohen.
The football team was led by coach Joe Paterno for 45 years. He was fired in 2011 along with the University President because they failed to report child abuse by a former assistant football coach. Former coach Jerry Sandusky was arrested on child abuse charges for the period 1994 to 2009. Both the Athletic Director and the vice president for business and finance were charged with perjury and resigned. The next day about 2,000 students rioted in protest, supporting coach Paterno. On November 11, the school staged a vigil to show support for the victims of child abuse.
The Education Secretary Arne Duncan said that colleges and universities have "a legal and moral responsibility to protect children", and that Penn State's failure to report the alleged abuse would be a "tragedy". The NCAA is considering sanctions against Penn State. Moody's Investors Service is reviewing Penn State's bond ratings for a possible downgrade. On November 14, 2011, the Big Ten Conference announced that its Championship football trophy will no longer be named for Paterno. On November 13, 2011, President Barack Obama said, "It's a good time for us to do some soul searching – every institution, not just Penn State – about what our priorities are, and making sure that we understand that our first priority is protecting our kids." 
Sandusky has denied all charges against him, although he was convicted of all charges in October 2012 and sentenced to 30-60 years in prison.
Penn State's sports teams are nicknamed Nittany Lions, except for the women's basketball team, which is known as the Lady Lions. Almost all teams play in the Big Ten Conference. Two teams in sports that the Big Ten does not sponsor play elsewhere. The women's ice hockey team plays in College Hockey America and the men's volleyball team in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association.

Fairness is the concept in sociology, law and generally in society, that something should be equal and not be a contradiction to accepted standards. It's related to justice in both the legal and sociological sense. Fairness is also treating others equally or in a way that is considered right or reasonable. Fairness can mean sameness where everything is kept equal by being the same. Fairness can also mean "deservedness" meaning a person gets what they deserve. People who are successful by working hard get what they deserve. People who are lazy and do not work hard get less. Fairness can also be based on need. Those who have more should give more to help others. This is based on the concept that people have obligations to each other. Judges, lawmakers, referees and teachers are among those expected to be fair in their decisions. Fairness is keeping decisions free from any form of discrimination.
In the United States fairness has long been a battle between equality and equity. Equality is the idea everyone should have an equal opportunity. If all the horses in a race start from the same point, the horse that wins is the fastest. Equity is the idea that adjustments need to be made to make things fair for both entities. One should get more than the other because that would be fair in this sense. For example, in the game of golf, when playing a skilled golfer, a less skilled golfer may be given a "handicap" (extra points) at the start of the game. This is to help make the final score fair for both players.

Evolutionary psychology

Evolutionary psychology is a branch of psychology which investigates behaviour which has evolved. It is similar in this respect to ethology, which has always used ideas from evolutionary biology.
It seeks to identify which human psychological traits are evolved adaptations, that is, functional products of natural selection or sexual selection. Evolutionary psychology usually focuses on behaviour most people share. Some of the more common areas evolutionary psychology is focused on are sex, and social behaviour. Events like violent behaviour need explanation in evolutionary terms. 
Evolutionary psychology is related to other fields of science like sociobiology, social psychology, and sociocultural anthropology. Evolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behaviour is the result of adaptations which evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments.
The adaptationist approach is steadily increasing as an influence in the general field of psychology. Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviours or traits which occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations. This includes our ability to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, and cooperate with others. They report successful tests of theoretical predictions related to such topics as infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price and parental investment.

There are two targets for age discrimination: old people (also called senior citizens) or very young people. Discrimination against old people might happen, for example, at job interviews. A company might hire a younger worker who is about 30 years old instead of someone who is about 50 years old.

A method of study that uses time and motion to work out the most efficient ways to do something, mainly repeated, routine motions. The man that made the theory of Scientific Management was named Frederick W. Taylor. 
However, Scientific Management was still trying to fix social and political problems with technical solutions. Many of the technological solutions may have solved one problem, while creating many more. Technocrats believed that management could replace politics. Administration is based on the application of rules that make certain outcomes, there are too many different points of view for the management approach to work.

Potassium nitrate

Potassium nitrate is a chemical compound. It has the chemical formula KNO. It contains potassium and nitrate ions. It is often called saltpeter. 
Potassium nitrate is a colorless solid. It dissolves in water. It is a common source of the nitrate ion. Potassium nitrate is a strong oxidizer. It decomposes to potassium nitrite and oxygen when heated. Its pH is almost neutral. It burns with a lilac flame.
It can be made by reacting ammonium nitrate with potassium hydroxide. It can also be made by reacting potassium chloride with ammonium nitrate. It might be made by reacting potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate with nitric acid. 
Saltpeter is a mineral form of potassium nitrate. It is only found in very dry areas. It is one of the few minerals that have nitrogen in them. 
Potassium nitrate is used in explosives. Oxygen from the air is the most common chemical that is used for oxidation, which is how most fires and explosions happen. Some explosions will use up oxygen so quickly, though, that there is not enough to finish the reaction, and the explosion is not very strong. Potassium nitrate replaces the need for oxygen and takes up much less space, which lets the explosion be stronger and faster. It is a main ingredient of gunpowder.
Potassium nitrate is also used in rocket fuel for the same reason as in explosives, except that the goal is to let the fuel burn longer, not faster. Potassium nitrate is used as a fertilizer, to help plants grow faster and grow in more places where it might be hard for them to grow otherwise. It can also be used to decay tree stumps.
Potassium nitrate is a little toxic. It also can start fires easily.

Video game journalism

Video game journalism is a branch of journalism that covers the reporting and discussion of video games. Usually, it covers the revealing of new games, the preview of new games, and the reviewing of new games. Recently, there has been a large growth in new online gaming websites and blogs.
The first video gaming magazine that is still in publication is the industry-oriented Play Meter magazine. The first consumer magazine specializing in video gaming was the U.K. magazine Computer and Video Gaming. It began in November, 1981. Two weeks later the first U.S. magazine, Electronic Games Magazine, was started. The oldest consumer gaming magazine in continuous circulation to the present time is Computer Gaming World.
The first regularly published web based magazine was either Game Zero Magazine (went online in November 1994) or Intelligent Gamer Online (individual issues were downloadable in 1993 but the site was not online until April 1995). Right now, online gaming magazines and websites have many advantages over print-based magazines. New information on future releases can be placed on online publications immediately, but the publishers have to wait until the next issue to put new information in print based magazines.
There have been many criticisms of the ethical standards of the video game journalism industry.
GameDaily's Chris Buffa Wrote a series of articles in July and August 2006.
These articles criticize the present state of video game journalism and offer suggestions for improvement: 
New Games Journalism is a term that was first used in 2004 by journalist Kieron Gillen. In New Games Journalism, personal experiences with a game, other personal experiences, and references to other types of media are used to explore the design, play, and culture of a game. This type of journalism focuses more on the subjective experience of an individual playing a game rather that an objectively reviewing the gameplay of a game. New games journalism has been criticized for wasting the reader's time with useless information, and for giving the reader a bad review of the mechanics, play control, and A.I. of a game.

Kleptocracy

Kleptocracy ('klepto' meaning 'theft') is the ruling of possibly any kind of government that uses its power to steal from its people. This rarely-applied word was used by Charles Krauthammer, the nationally syndicated Washington Post columnist and political commentator on Fox-TV, on Saturday, March 2, and Sunday, March 3, 2014. He referred to Russia as a "kleptocracy" in a TV panel discussion about its influence in the revolution in the neighboring Ukraine in late February. His political column added another derivation of this word: "kleptocratic".
"Kleptocratic" is used by Krauthammer in the following quote: "But surely the West has more financial clout than Russia's kleptocratic extraction economy that exports little but oil, gas and vodka."

Unified field theory

Unified field theory is an idea about a theory of fields in physics that will explain all natural phenomena. Theories in physics can be very different and even disagree with each other. This is true for example for quantum mechanics (the science of very small things) and general relativity (the science of space and time). The goal of unified field theory is to take all the different parts of physics and combine them into one theory that explains everything. The Standard Model is a theory close to a unified field theory, combining everything except general relativity.

Riemann hypothesis

The Riemann hypothesis is a mathematical conjecture. Many people think that finding a proof of the hypothesis is one of the hardest and most important unsolved problems of pure mathematics.
The hypothesis is named after Bernhard Riemann. It is about a special function, the Riemann zeta function. This function inputs and outputs complex number values. The inputs that give the output zero are called zeros of the zeta function. Many zeros have been found. The "obvious" ones to find are the negative even integers. This follows from Riemann's functional equation. More have been computed and have real part 1/2. The hypothesis states all the undiscovered zeros must have real part 1/2.
The functional equation also says all zeros (except the "obvious" ones) must be in the critical strip: real part is between 0 and 1. The Riemann hypothesis says more: they are on the line given, in the image on the right (the white dots). If the hypothesis is false, this would mean that there are white dots which are not on the line given. 
If proven correct, this would allow mathematicians to better describe how the prime numbers are placed among whole numbers. The Riemann hypothesis is so important, and so difficult to prove, that the Clay Mathematics Institute has offered $1,000,000 to the first person to prove it.

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, or RPI is a private university in Troy, NY. It was made in 1824 by Stephen Van Rensselaer because he wanted there to be schools that taught science and engineering. It is the oldest engineering school in America. Lots of students from RPI get jobs that pay a lot of money after they leave RPI. Some people who went to RPI have started big companies like NVIDIA, John Wiley and Sons, and Texas Instruments. George Low, an American who helped get spaceships into space, went to RPI. 
What RPI focuses on has changed a lot since it was first made. There still is a lot of engineering at the school, but now there is growing arts and social studies teaching at the school. A big concert hall called EMPAC was opened in 2008 at RPI.
Most of RPI's sports teams play in NCAA Division III, which does not allow athletic scholarships. The men's and women's ice hockey teams play as Division I teams in ECAC Hockey. The hockey teams are can award scholarships because of a special NCAA rule.

Jack Russell Terrier

The Jack Russell Terrier is a small dog with a white coat that can be smooth or rough-coated. Some have a broken coat that is also called "wire-haired".
This terrier is good at fox hunting.
The Jack Russell terrier were originally bred in England by the Reverend John Russell from about 1819. The Jack Russell is sturdier than the standard terrier. It is a fast runner, has a great nose and can hunt the fox even when it goes underground. It can also be used as a work dog. 
As with other domesticated animals, there are numerous variations. Differences in naming were caused by the different regulations of different kennel clubs. Some dog clubs make a difference between what they call "Parson Jack Russell Terriers", which are over 12" (inches) at the shoulders, and "Jack Russell Terriers" which are under 12" in height. Other clubs do not. They are broadly the same type of dog. It is easy to change the height of dogs by selective breeding, and the reason working dogs come in different sizes is to make them better at a particular job. Taller terriers were used for hunting foxes, and smaller terriers were used for hunting rabbits and rodents.

The Hound of the Baskervilles

The Hound of the Baskervilles is a Sherlock Holmes novel. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle started writing it in 1901 and finished it in 1902. It was very popular, because fans had been waiting a long time for a new Sherlock Holmes story. This was because Conan Doyle had killed off Sherlock Holmes in the story "The Final Problem", originally published in 1893 and afterwards collected in the book "The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes". He was later revealed to be alive in "The Adventure of the Empty House" (originally published in 1903), a story in the book "The Return of Sherlock Holmes", which was released in 1905.
The book tells the story of how Holmes and his friend Doctor Watson solve the mystery of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. In the story, people think that he died because of a family curse, to do with an evil dog. In the end, the dog is revealed to be a trained big dog painted with glow-in-the-dark paint to make it seem evil.

This is pretty much a copy of a recent blog post I made, but I thought it'd make an interesting article. 
The last few days have been rough for the Simple English Wikipedia. Following a dramatic ANI thread about 's unbanning on the English Wikipedia, EN now has the general idea that Simple is just a breeding ground for blocked EN editors to wreak havoc.
In the past week, we've had two blocked EN users ( and ) become banned at Simple, and they've both socked after their ban. I really don't know what direction the project is going in.
I think that the starting point for all of this was the infamous Simplewiki vandal known mostly by the name "Static" ( and , who was unblocked and mentored several times, even after socking through a ban. Simple gave him many, many chances, and he's never been rebanned (he doesn't edit Simple very often, good for the both of us). Also, I myself drew up a mentoring plan for now-banned editor , Static's fellow young and immature user. Maybe, it's our sheltering of such immature trolls that has given us such a bad reputation. I don't really know if we can ever redeem ourselves.

Transonic means breaking the sound barrier by travelling faster than the speed of sound (1,236 kph or 768 mph).
The speed of flight is divided into four groups based on speed.
Transonic means going from subsonic to supersonic. Subsonic ends and supersonic begins at mach 1, so transonic goes from mach 0.8 to 1.2. When you are going through transonic speeds, drag increases and it is really hard to go any faster. This is the sound barrier.

<doc id="169177" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169177" title="Lobotomy">
Lobotomy

Lobotomy, also known as leucotomy, is a type of brain surgery. It was invented in 1935 by António Egas Moniz, a Portuguese neurologist. He won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1949 "for his discovery of the therapeutic value of leucotomy in certain psychoses". The operation cut the connections from the pre-frontal cortex (front part of the frontal lobes) to the rest of the brain. At first it seemed a great success, but the operation is now rarely done.
He used the method for certain types of mental illness for which there was no other treatment. He first used it on patients with obsessive behaviour, which they repeated time and again. It was also used to treat other mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and clinical depression. 
The problem with lobotomies was that they forever changed a person's personality and behaviour. Sometimes, the results were beneficial: patients which had been violent became calm. But long-term studies, which were not done by Moniz, show some had severely damaged personalities. They often had very little 'drive' and motivation.
Today, antipsychotic drugs, like chlorpromazine, may treat the symptoms of such disorders. Lobotomies are seldom done.
One question is why was such a dramatic surgical technique so widely accepted. It is generally agreed that psychiatrists wanted to find some way of helping thousands of patients in psychiatric hospitals in the twentieth century. Also, those same patients had little power to resist the increasingly radical and even reckless interventions of asylum doctors.
According to the "Psychiatric Dictionary" in 1970:
Good results are obtained in about 40 percent of cases, fair results in some 35 percent and poor results in 25 percent. The mortality rate probably does not exceed 3 percent. Greatest improvement is seen in patients whose premorbid personalities were 'normal', cyclothymic, or obsessive compulsive; in patients with superior intelligence and good education; in psychoses with sudden onset and a clinical picture of affective symptoms of depression or anxiety, and with behaviouristic changes such as refusal of food, overactivity, and delusional ideas of a paranoid nature. 
According to the same source, prefrontal lobotomy reduces:
anxiety feelings and introspective activities; and feelings of inadequacy and self-consciousness are thereby lessened. Lobotomy reduces the emotional tension associated with hallucinations and does away with the catatonic state. Because nearly all psychosurgical procedures have undesirable side effects, they are ordinarily resorted to only after all other methods have failed. The less disorganized the personality of the patient, the more obvious are post-operative side effects. ... 
Convulsive seizures are reported as [effects] of prefrontal lobotomy in 5 to 10 percent of all cases. Such seizures are ordinarily well controlled with the usual anti-convulsive drugs. Post-operative blunting of the personality, apathy, and irresponsibility are the rule rather than the exception. Other side effects include distractibility, childishness, facetiousness, lack of tact or discipline, and post-operative incontinence.

<doc id="169180" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169180" title="Hot air balloon">
Hot air balloon

A hot air balloon is a type of aircraft. It is lifted by heating the air inside the balloon, usually with fire. Hot air weighs less than the same volume of cold air (it is less dense), which means that hot air will rise up or float when there is cold air around it, just like a bubble of air in a pot of water. The greater the difference between the hot and the cold, the greater the difference in density, and the stronger the balloon will pull up. This means that balloons can carry more weight on a cold day, or if the air inside the balloon is very hot.
The hot air balloon is the oldest form of flying technology that can successfully carry people. The earliest use of hot air to make objects fly was made in Ancient China. Paper lanterns were sent into the air for signalling.
The first hot air balloon to carry a person was made by the Montgolfier brothers. On 19 September 1783, they demonstrated their invention for King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette at the French court in Paris. The passengers were a sheep, a duck and a rooster. They flew for 480 metres. The first flight carrying a person was on 15 October 1783. It carried Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier. The balloon was attached to the ground by a rope. The first "free" flight, without being attached to the ground, was a few weeks later, on 21 November 1783. It carried Marquis François d'Arlandes and Pilatre de Rozier.
The air is made up of molecules. When the air is cold, these molecules are closer together. When the air is hot, they move away from each other. So, in the same space, there are fewer molecules in hot air. Hot air is therefore lighter than cold air. This makes it rise and carry up the balloon when the air inside it is heated. The air is heated in the balloon with a burner, which uses bursts of fire to keep the air hot. The fire is fuelled by propane.
The heated air is kept inside the balloon by its fabric. This is called the "envelope". It is usually made of nylon.
The passengers and the pilot stand in the basket, which is attached to the balloon by ropes. The basket is usually made of wicker. Baskets can come in many sizes. It can have enough places for up to 36 people. It depends the size of the balloon to carry that much weight.
A hot air balloon festival is a type of air show. It is where ballooners display and fly their balloons together. During these events, they fly in the morning and in the evening if the conditions allow it. People can enjoy a balloon flight if they pay. There are many activities. Sometimes, the balloons are lit up against the night sky.
At these festivals, people can see different shapes of balloons. Usually, they are kind of round but they may have forms.

Biplane

A biplane is a Fixed-wing aircraft that is heavier than air but can fly. Biplanes are special because they have two fixed wings. Biplanes have a stronger structure but they produce more drag than normal fixed-wing aircraft. Biplanes can usually have more lift than similar monoplanes, but also create more drag. 
In the biplane set-up, the lower wing is often attached to the body of the aircraft and the top wing is raised above. Almost all biplanes also have a tail wing.
Famous biplanes include the Polikarpov Po-2, Sopwith Camel, Avro Tutor, Antonov An-2, Beechcraft Staggerwing, Boeing Stearman, Bristol Bulldog, Curtiss JN-4, de Havilland Tiger Moth, Fairey Swordfish, Hawker Hart, Pitts Special and the Wright Flyer. The Stearman is particularly associated with stunt flying with wing-walkers. Famous sesquiplanes include the Nieuport 17 and Albatros D.III.

Blank slate, or tabula rasa (which means the same thing) was a philosophical idea of John Locke. It had, like much of philosophy, a history which went as far back as Aristotle, but it was Locke who made it known to our modern world:
Humans, when born, are thought not have mental experience or knowledge, and that everything is learned after they grow. In particular, Locke thought all knowledge came from sense data, and the mind is empty at the beginning. By 'sense data' is meant the process of hearing, seeing, touching etc.
Locke's idea was immediately picked up by others:
Many have held similar views. The founder of behaviourism, John B. Watson (1878–1938):
Throughout the 20th century the influence of evolution and genetics ran against these liberal ideas. Ethology proved that much animal behaviour was inherited, instinctual, (innate and permanent). Konrad Lorenz argued that the aggression so obvious in the history of mankind was a playing out of behaviour which had evolutionary advantage in our past. The field of evolutionary psychology set out to examine the role played by evolution on our mental life. If humans share a common evolutionary history with the other animals, it is likely that we inherit mental traits from our evolution. The human ability to learn a language is inherited, and is of huge practical importance. Very important also (though less obvious) is the way that our unconscious mind helps us get through life. The apparatus which performs that mental activity is certainly inherited. These are some reasons why a number of recent publications have rejected Locke's idea.

Coypu

The coypu (or nutria, "Myocastor coypus") is a large, plant-eating, rodent which lives in wetlands. The nutria first came from South America including Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile, and Uruguay. Animals were taken to Louisiana in the 1930s to be farmed for their fur. Some of these animals escaped and are now living in the Louisiana coastal wetlands. They have become a pest and have damaged the environment.

Poincaré conjecture

The Poincaré Conjecture is a question about spheres in mathematics. It is named after Henri Poincaré, the French mathematician and physicist who formulated it in 1904.
The sphere (also called the 2-sphere, as it is a 2-dimensional surface, although it is usually seen as inside a three dimensional space) has the property that any loop on it can be contracted to a point (if a rubber band is wrapped around the sphere, it is possible to slide it down to a point). Mathematicians say that the 2-sphere is simply connected. Other spaces do not have this property, for example the donut: a rubber band that goes around the whole donut once cannot be slid down to a point without it leaving the surface.
Mathematicians knew that this property was unique to the 2-sphere, in the sense that any other simply connected space that does not have edges and is small enough (in mathematician terms, that is compact) is in fact the 2-sphere. It is no longer true if we remove the idea of smallness however, as an infinitely large plane is also simply connected. Also, a regular disk (a circle and its interior) is simply connected, but it has an edge (the bounding circle).
The conjecture asks whether the same is true for the 3-sphere, which is an object living naturally in four dimensions. This question motivated much of modern mathematics, especially in the field of topology. The question was finally settled in 2002 by Grigori Perelman, a Russian mathematician, with methods from geometry, showing that it is indeed true. He was awarded a Fields medal for his work, which he declined.
The Poincaré conjecture can also be extended to higher dimensions: this is the generalised Poincaré conjecture. Surprisingly, it was easier to prove the fact for higher-dimensional spheres: In 1960, Smale proved it to be true for the 5-sphere, 6-sphere and higher, and in 1982, Freedman proved that it was also true for the 4-sphere, for which he was awarded a Fields medal.

Megafauna

The term is most used for the Pleistocene megafauna the large land animals of the last ice age, such as mammoths. It is also used for the largest living wild land animals, especially elephants, giraffes, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, elk, condors, etc. 
Its use is connected with the discussion about the Holocene extinctions after the ice age. Most of the large land animals which were alive 12,000 years ago are now extinct, and there is much discussion as to what has caused this. The two main theories are hunting by humans, and climate change. Together, these reasons are enough to explain why these previously successful animals are now extinct. Elephant birds on Madagascar were certainly hunted to extinction, as were the Moas in New Zealand. Archaeological sites with evidence of moa hunting are all over New Zealand. The moas became extinct about five hundred years ago. The moas had survived being hunted by Haast's Eagle, but they did not survive being hunted for food by the Maoris.
For many others the climate changes may have been the main reason for their extinction.

90482 Orcus, originally known by the provisional designation 2004 DW) is a Kuiper belt object (KBO) and could be a dwarf planet. It was found by Michael Brown, Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz on February 17, 2004. It was also seen in pictures from November 8, 1951.
A moon of Orcus was found on 22 February 2007. The orbit of this moon has yet to be found out.
The satellite was found at 0.25 arcsec from Orcus with magnitude difference of 2.7.
Assuming an albedo similar to that of the primary, the magnitude suggests a diameter of about 220 km. It is thought to be a smaller KBO that was captured.

Cucurbitales

The Cucurbitales is an order of flowering plants, included in the rosid group of dicotyledons. This order mostly belongs to tropical areas, with limited presence in subtropic and temperate regions. The order includes various shrubs and trees, together with many herbs and climbing plants.
One of major characteristics of the Cucurbitales is the presence of unisexual flowers, with thick pointed petals (whenever present). The pollination is usually performed by insects, but wind pollination, where flowers use the wind to move pollen from one flower to the next, is also present (in Coriariaceae and Datiscaceae).
The order consists of roughly 2600 species in eight families. The largest families are Begoniaceae (begonia family) with 1400 species and Cucurbitaceae (gourd family) with 825 species.
The large families of Cucurbitales include several economically important plants. Specifically, the Cucurbitaceae are responsible for some food species, such as squash, pumpkin (both from "Cucurbita"), watermelon ("Citrullus vulgaris"), melon and cucumber (both "Cucumis"). The Begoniaceae are known for their horticultural species, of which there are over 130.

Nachos were invented in 1943 by Ignacio "Nacho" Anaya. Anaya worked at a restaurant called the Victory Club in Piedas Negras, Coahuila, Mexico. One night, the wives of several soldiers from nearby Fort Duncan arrived at the restaurant after it had closed for the day. Anaya cut some corn tortillas into slices and topped them with cheese and sliced jalapeño peppers to make a snack for the women. He called the dish "Nacho's special." Eventually it came to be known simply as "nachos." Nachos are most popular in Mexico.

Unicycle

A unicycle is a pedal vehicle. It is like a bicycle, but it has only one wheel. It has a seat and pedals, but no chain or gears. There is no handlebar, it is steered by gripping the seat with the legs and twisting the body. A rider keeps their balance by moving their arms, and controlling their speed. It is usually used for acting and performing. A unicycle is more expensive than a cheap bicycle, because unicycles are far less common.
There are two kinds of unicycles; giraffe unicycles and traditional unicycles. Giraffe unicycles are much taller than traditional unicycles, and use a chain so that the performer's legs do not have to stretch very far. Giraffe unicycles are mostly used by performers in circuses. 
Unicycles are often used while the performer is simultaneously juggling or plate spinning. To do this, performers usually rock back and forth on the unicycle. This is called "idling". It lets the performer pay attention to what they are doing in their hands, instead of to the ground in front of them. To "idle" a unicycle, performers usually press one foot down, anchoring it in the bottom position of the wheel. This foot both provides support and completes the rocking motion that is necessary to keep the unicycle balanced.
Many other tricks can be done when riding a unicycle. This includes going backwards, riding up and down steps, pedaling with only one foot, hopping in place, wheel-walking (putting the feet on the tire instead of on the pedals) and riding over obstacles.

Dark energy

Dark energy is the name given to the force that is believed to be making the universe larger. Distant galaxies appear to be moving away from us at high speed: the idea is that the universe is getting bigger and has been since the Big Bang. Measurements are now accurate enough to allow astronomers to tell that these galaxies seem to be accelerating away from us. The universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate.
This faster and faster expansion is not understood by scientists. There are many ideas for what might be causing the rapid expansion. However, at the moment, cosmologists who study it do not have an answer. It is "as if" there was something there in empty space providing a repulsive force that makes the universe expand. This has been named dark energy.
The following reference, which is beyond can be discussed on this wiki, sets out the problem for theoretical physics.

The Rockefeller Foundation and Ford Foundation helped to transfer and adapt these scientific advances to the conditions in developing countries.The first investments were in research on rice and wheat, two of the most important food crops for developing countries.The breeding of improved plant varieties, combined with the expanded use of fertilizers and pesticides, and irrigation, led to big yield increases in Asia and Latin America, beginning in the late 1960s. The term “Green Revolution” was used to describe this large growth in agriculture.

<doc id="169405" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169405" title="Victoria line">
Victoria line

The Victoria line is part of the London Underground network. It is a deep-level underground metro line that runs from Brixton in the south of London to the Walthamstow Central in the north-east. It started running in 1968. On the Tube map it is shown with a light blue colour. It is the fourth busiest line on the London Underground network. It is the only line on the Underground, other than the two-stop Waterloo & City line, which is completely underground. The only section of track to come above ground is the route to the depot from Seven Sisters to Northumberland Park.
The line has hump-backed stations which allow trains to store gravitational potential energy as they arrive and to then use this energy as they leave the stations. The stations are on top of small hills, or humps. As the train travels up the hill to the station its weight helps it to slow down. As the train leaves the station it travels down the hill, with gravity helping the train to speed up. This saves 5% energy and makes the trains run 9% faster. Each new platform built for the Victoria Line is 132.6 metres long. 183 million people use the Victoria line each year.
The concept of a new tube railway running from Victoria to Walthamstow was first proposed by a Working Party set up by the British Transport Commission in 1948. The main purpose of the line was to relieve congestion in the central area. The Private Bill needed to build it was introduced into Parliament in 1955. The Bill described a line from Victoria to Walthamstow (Wood Street). There was also a proposal for an extension from Victoria to Fulham Broadway station on the District line, but this was not included in the Bill.
The construction work on the Walthamstow–Victoria section began in 1962. It continued until 1972, when Pimlico station was opened. A test tunnel from Tottenham to Manor House under Seven Sisters Road had been constructed in 1959 and this was later integrated into the running tunnels. The Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the line during its construction. In July 1968, they visited the tunnels that were being built under Vauxhall Park.
Barbara Castle, the Minister of Transport gave approval on 4 August 1967 to build the Brixton extension. Preparatory work started at a site on Bessborough Gardens near to Vauxhall Bridge Road in May 1967. On 28 June 1968, Richard Marsh, then Minister of Transport approved the proposal to build a station at Pimlico.
The name "Victoria line" dates back to 1955. The other suggestions were "Walvic line" (Walthamstow Central station–Victoria station) and "Viking line" (Victoria station–King's Cross station). During the planning stages, it was known as "Route C". Later, it was named the Victoria line after Victoria Station by David McKenna. This suggestion was seconded by Sir John Elliot.
The Victoria line was designed to get rid of build-ups of traffic on other lines, such as the Piccadilly line. It was also designed to have as many interchanges as possible, and all stations except Pimlico have an interchange with at least one other London Underground or National Rail line. It had been intended to build the line past Walthamstow Central to Wood Street (Walthamstow), where it would come above ground to terminate next to the British Railways station. However, a late decision in 1961 saw the line cut back to Walthamstow Central station. Until 1968 this station was called Walthamstow (Hoe Street).
Each Victoria line station apart from Pimlico was built as an interchange station and several existing stations were re–arranged to allow for cross-platform interchange with it. In some cases this was achieved by placing the Victoria line platforms on either side of the existing station. In others the Victoria line uses one of the older platforms and the existing line was diverted into a new platform.
At Euston, northbound Victoria and Northern line (Bank branch) trains run along platforms next to each other, although they are travelling in opposite directions. "Same-direction" cross-platform interchanges are available at Stockwell (with the Northern line), Oxford Circus (with the Bakerloo line), Highbury & Islington (with First Capital Connect, originally the Northern City Line) and at Finsbury Park (with the Piccadilly line).
All Victoria line stations were originally tiled in a light blue colour. Each station was decorated with tiled motifs on seating recesses to differentiate them from each other. During the construction of the Jubilee line in the late 1970s, the original motifs on Green Park station were replaced by motifs matching the new design for the Jubilee line platforms.
Platform humps were installed on all Victoria Line stations, except for Pimlico, during late 2010 and 2011. This was done to provide step-free access to trains. The Rail Vehicle Accessibility (Non Interoperable Rail System) Regulations 2010 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 created the need for the humps to be installed. The humps are a ramp type, similar to those being installed on some mainline stations. They are of a masonry construction.
The first section opened was between Walthamstow Central and Highbury & Islington. There was no opening ceremony for this. The normal timetable started on 1 September 1968. The first train left Walthamstow Central for Highbury & Islington at about 6.30 am. Later that year, the section between Highbury & Islington and Warren Street was opened. Again there was no ceremony.
The official opening ceremony for the line took place at Victoria station on 7 March 1969. Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a commemorative plaque on the station concourse. After a short ceremony, she bought a 5d (old pence) ticket and travelled to Green Park. In new pence this would be about 2.08p.
Princess Alexandra opened the Brixton extension on 23 July 1971. She made a journey from Brixton to Vauxhall.
Trains run every two minutes during peak periods (when its the busiest). In normal service, all trains run from Brixton to Seven Sisters. About three out of five continue to Walthamstow Central.
When the line first opened it was served by a fleet of 8-car 1967 tube stock trains. Each is made up of two four-car units. Later on, a number of cars of 1972 Mark I tube stock were adapted to work with the 1967 stock. This meant that there were finally 43 trains, each of which was made up of two four-car units. The 1967 tube stock was replaced by 2009 tube stock between 2009 and 2011 (see below).
At first, an articulated type of rolling stock was considered. This idea was not used because it would have been to difficult to move the stock to Acton Works for heavy overhauls. This is no longer a problem since train overhauls have been moved away from Acton Works to the builders' own works. The new 2009 tube stock has a wider profile and slightly longer carriage. This prevents it from running on other deep-level tube lines.
The line has an Automatic Train Operation system (ATO). The train operator (driver) closes the train doors and presses a pair of "start" buttons. If the way ahead is clear, the ATO drives the train at a safe speed to the next station and stops there. This system has been in place since the line opened in 1968. This makes the Victoria line the world's first full-scale automatic railway.
When the Victoria line was built, there were severe budget restrictions. As a result, the station infrastructure standards were lower than on older lines and on later extension projects. Examples of these lower standards include narrower than usual platforms and undecorated ceilings at Walthamstow Central, Blackhorse Road and Tottenham Hale. This also affects lighting levels. At most stations between the up and down escalators there is a concrete staircase where an additional escalator could be installed, but has not been fitted. It can cause severe congestion at peak times. This has been remedied at Brixton in 2004 and at Vauxhall in 2006 where an additional escalator has been installed in place of the fixed stairway.
In addition, there have been station closures for safety reasons, when both escalators have been unserviceable. Over many years, heavy equipment has been installed in fenced-off sections at the ends of platforms owing to the lack of anywhere else to install them. It is not clear from Transport for London's Five-Year Investment Programme whether these shortcomings are likely to be remedied.
The 1967 stock was replaced bit by bit from July 2009 as part of Transport for London's 5-year £10 billion redevelopment project. The replacement for the line's 1967 tube stock is the 2009 tube stock built by Bombardier Transportation. The first train was built in 2006. Testing of the new trains began in 2008. The main fleet began to be introduced in 2009 and went into main service in 2010. The last of the 1967 stock trains ran on 30 June 2011, after which the whole service was provided by 2009 stock.
Supporters of Tottenham Hotspur (and the club itself) have campaigned for a surface station to be opened next to Northumberland Park Station, next to the line's depot. This would provide an improvement in transport links, seen as essential if the club's wish to redevelop their ground and increase crowd capacity is to become a reality. The idea was looked into but Network Rail own the necessary land and need it for their own expansion plans.
If the Chelsea–Hackney line is built then it will relieve a lot of congestion on the Victoria line. It will offer an alternative route across Central London between Victoria and King's Cross St. Pancras.
For many years there have been proposals to extend southwards from Brixton one stop to Herne Hill. This station would be on a large reversing loop with one platform. This would remove a critical capacity restriction by eliminating the need for trains to reverse at Brixton. However, this would be expensive and cannot currently be justified on cost-benefit reasons. Given that the current line is heavily overcrowded, this is the only extension proposal that has any realistic possibility of ever existing. Even so, it would have to be seen to be effective at reducing overcrowding (by enabling trains to run more frequently) rather than adding to overcrowding to have any hope of being built.
Northumberland Park Depot is the service and storage area for trains on the Victoria Line. It is the only part of the line not in tunnel. It is located next to Northumberland Park railway station, on Tottenham Marshes, Tottenham in the London Borough of Haringey.
The Depot is connected to the Victoria Line by a tunnelled branch line to a junction to the north of Seven Sisters. It was opened with the first stage of the line in 1968.
There is a local campaign for platforms for the Victoria Line to be built at Northumberland Park station. This is supported by the Haringey Council and by Tottenham Hotspur F.C.; the platforms are seen as essential to the club's plans to increase capacity at their White Hart Lane ground.

Third rail

A third rail is a metal rail that is placed on either side of a train track to provide electrical power to trains traveling along the tracks. They are often used on subways and local train services. Before third rails, electricity used to be carried in overhead wires.
Electricity as a method of giving power to a train came about during the 1800s. Scottish engineer Robert Davidson designed and built an electric locomotive in 1837 using batteries. Using batteries meant that the locomotive could not be used on the main railways due to the constant need to charge them. It was not until German engineer Werner von Siemens in 1879 that the first design of a reliable electric locomotive to carry passengers was made. Siemens' design used a 2.2kW electric motor and had a top speed of just over 13km/h. This new locomotive hauled three passenger cars along a 300 meter circular railway track and carried around 90,000 people in four months during its trail run at the Berlin Industrial Exhibition. Siemens' electric locomotive was the first train to utilize a third rail and power was provided via a dedicated dynamo. The early designs of electric trains were unable to access a widely available and reliable source of electricity. A network of electricity that went where ever the network of rail went was needed. Whilst many modern distance trains utilize an overhead wire system to provide power, the third rail was the first viable means of supplying power and is one that remains very much in use world-wide today. 
The third rail is usually located outside the two running rails, but occasionally between them. The electricity is transmitted to the train by means of a sliding shoe, which is held in contact with the rail. On many systems an insulating cover is provided above the third rail to protect employees working near the track; sometimes the shoe is designed to contact the side (called side running) or bottom (called bottom running) of the third rail, allowing the protective cover to be mounted directly to its top surface. When the shoe slides on top, it is referred to as top running. When the shoe slides on the bottom it is not affected by the build-up of snow or leaves.
Third rails typically carry hundreds of volts in high amperage current. This makes them very dangerous. In 2005 American James Maki fell onto the third rail at a Boston rail station and suffered extensive and disfiguring injuries. As part of his treatment he became the second American recipient of a face transplant. Many deaths occur around the world each year due to human contact with a third rail. In New York City there have been multiple cases of people dying because they have urinated on the third rail.

Yonge Street

Yonge Street (pronounced "young") is a main street in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and its northern suburbs. It was once listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest street in the world and is listed as a national historic site. It was the site of Canada's first subway line.
Yonge Street is the home of or close to many places of interest in Toronto, including street and theatre acts, the Eaton Centre, the Hockey Hall of Fame and–at the very start of the road–'One Yonge Street', the offices of the "Toronto Star" newspaper. The Yonge Line of the Toronto subway under or along it from south of King Street to Finch Avenue. The Viva Blue BRT line goes along Yonge from Finch to Newmarket Bus Terminal.
Yonge Street is thought to be Toronto's main street, because of it splits the city into east and west, and the has the Yonge subway line running under it. It is also the main place people come to celebrate events.
Parts of the street are often closed for events, such as an yearly street party. Toronto's annual Gay Pride, Orange Order, and Santa Claus parades also use Yonge Street for a large part of their routes. Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot has a song about Yonge Street, titled "On Yonge Street", on his album "A Painter Passing Through".

<doc id="169441" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169441" title="Dinoflagellate">
Dinoflagellate

The dinoflagellates are a large group of flagellate protists. About half are photosynthetic, the rest are mostly heterotroph predators of other protists. The ones which are photosynthetic are sometimes loosely called 'algae'; the one which are predators are sometimes loosely called 'protozoa'. 
They have been classified as an order, a class and a phylum by different authors. Active research is being done on their relationships.
Most are marine plankton, but they are common in fresh water habitats as well. Their populations are distributed depending on temperature, salinity, or depth. The group includes many symbionts and bioluminescent species.
About 1,555 species of free-living marine dinoflagellates are currently described. The latest estimates suggest a total of 2,294 living dinoflagellate species, which includes marine, freshwater and parasitic dinoflagellates.
Some dinoflagellates are zooxanthellae: endosymbionts of marine eukaryotes, and animals such as anthozoan corals. These reef-building corals largely depend on them. Other organisms which can host zooxanthellae include jellyfish, clams, foraminifera, sea slugs i.e. nudibranchs, and also ciliates and radiolaria.
Dinoflagellates are responsible for the 'red tides' which may poison fish. They sometimes bloom in concentrations of more than a million cells per millilitre. Some species produce neurotoxins, which in such quantities kill fish and accumulate in filter feeders such as shellfish, which in turn may pass them on to people who eat them. This phenomenon is called a red tide, from the color the bloom imparts to the water. Not all dinoflagellate blooms are dangerous. Bluish flickers visible in ocean water at night often come from blooms of bioluminescent dinoflagellates, which emit short flashes of light when disturbed.
Although classified as eukaryotes, the dinoflagellate nuclei lack some key features of eukaryotic nuclei. In fact, Dodge termed the dinoflagellate nucleus as "mesokaryotic", due to its possession of intermediate characteristics between the coiled DNA areas of prokaryotic bacteria and the well-defined eukaryotic nucleus. This group, however, does contain typically eukaryotic organelles, such as golgi complexes, mitochondria and chloroplasts.
The group contains many complex organelles and life styles. Some have structures rather like vertebrates eyes; some have nematocysts; some live as plasmodia (multinucleate forms); some have two flagella; photosynthetic dinoflagellates contain a "bewildering array" of plastid types; and the whole of their genetics and cell biology is eccentric.
Fossil dinoflagellates are important in "stratigraphy", the dating and correlation of strata. During their life, dinoflagellates have a mobile planktonic form and a resistant cyst phase which enables them to survive over winter in sediment. Only the cyst gets fossilised. Their first certain appearance is in the Silurian period, with a big radiation in the Mesozoic era. They are classified as "Phylum Dinomastigota" by Margulis and colleagues.

Epiphyte

An epiphyte is a plant which grows on another plant, without being a parasite. The term is also be used for bacteria, fungi, lichens and mosses which grow on plants. However, most epiphytes (89%) are flowering plants; and about a third of all ferns are epiphytes. 
An epiphyte gets its moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, and sometimes from debris accumulating around it. The ones in the temperate zone are often mosses, liverworts, lichens and algae, and in the tropics ferns, cacti, orchids, and bromeliads.
Sometimes such plants are called air plants, because they do not root in soil. This is misleading though, as there are many aquatic epiphytes as well. Epiphytic organisms only take support from the host; they are usually not parasites. Parasitic and semi-parasitic plants, like the mistletoe are not true epiphytes.
Epiphytes usually use photosynthesis to get energy; often they have adapted their leaves to be able to capture rainwater (and moisture from the air) if they are not aquatic.
Epiphytes are important for other species too, certain frogs live in the water reservoir of epiphytes.

Mohammed Rafi

Mohammed Rafi (, , December 24, 1924 – July 31, 1980) was a popular Bollywood playback singer. In a career of over 40 years, Rafi sang more than 26,000 songs in the national languages of India and sometimes in other languages.
In 1944, Rafi moved to Mumbai. Rafi appeared in two movies. In 1945, he appeared on the screen for the song "Tera Jalwa Jis Ne Dekha" in the film "Laila Majnu". He sang a number of songs as part of the chorus, including with K. L. Saigal from the movie "Shahjahan" (1946). Rafi sang in Mehboob Khan's "Anmol Ghadi" (1946). He had a duet with Noor Jehan in the 1947 film "Jugnu", "Yahan Badla Wafa Ka". After partition, Rafi decided to stay in India. Noor Jehan migrated to Pakistan and made a pair with playback singer Ahmed Rushdi.
In 1949, Rafi was given solo songs by music directors such as Naushad, Shyam Sunder, and Husnalal Bhagatram.
In his early career, Rafi associated with many contemporary music directors, most notably Naushad Ali. In the late 1950s and 1960s, he worked with other composers of the era such as O. P. Nayyar, Shankar Jaikishan, S.D. Burman and Roshan.
In the early 1970s, Rafi recorded fewer songs. He made a comeback as a leading singer in 1974.
On Thursday, July 31, 1980, Rafi died at 10:50 p.m., following a massive heart attack. He had four sons (Saeed Rafi, Khalid Rafi, Hamid Rafi, Shahid Rafi), three daughters (Parveen, Nasreen, Yasmin) and 18 grandchildren.

Loon

A loon is a bird that lives on water. It is like a duck. Loons are the size of a large duck or a small goose. Loons can be hard to find because they are shy around people. The name "loon" is from the Scandinavian word for "clumsy". Loons are the state bird of Minnesota. Loons are found in most parts of North America and Eastern Europe. They enjoy cool climates in the summer and migrate to ocean coasts in the winter.
Loons can dive up to 200 feet underwater for food. Their bodies are shaped for diving. To dive better, they have solid bones (most birds' bones are hollow) and feet placed far back for swimming under the water.
There are five North American loon species. They have black (or grey)-and-white heads, pale breasts, and striped back feathers. 
Loons can lay up to two eggs. They are brownish in color which helps them blend into their surroundings. Both the male and female parent take turns sitting on the eggs. After hatching, they fly south when the weather gets cool. The young loons spend three years in the south before returning to the north.
They are best known for their loud, trumpeting call. They also make melodic, wailing or laughing sounds. Loons communicate to each other through their sounds. They also communicate with humans and other animals through dance. Loons warn others to stay away from their nests by dancing on the water. Loons are protective parents and will dance to exhaustion and death to protect their eggs. Raccoons, gulls, and skunks have been known to devour loon eggs. 
Loons eat fish like sunfish, perch, and bullheads. Loons do not chew their food. They have elastic throats that allow the loon to swallow their food whole. When they swallow fish, their throat expands to the size of the fish they eat so they do not choke. 
Scientists band, or tag loons to try to understand more about them.

Crossbow

The crossbow, or arbalest, is a weapon which consists of a bow-like arc called "prod" and cross-wise body called "stock" and trigger mechanism. The crossbow is an invention in which the stock, a piece of wood is mounted on two other crossing pieces. Crossbows shoot short arrows called "bolts" which are similar to arrows. The crossbow was first created by the Chinese people in circa 6 B.C. The Greeks invented crossbow separately in 4th century B.C. The Romans called the weapon "arcuballista". Crossbow was a very popular weapon in the Middle Ages as it was strong and accurate and could be used as a sharpshooter weapon. The Arabs call crossbow "qaws Ferengi", "European bow", for this reason as the Crusaders used crossbow a lot. A good crossbow can shoot the bolt with such immense power that it may pierce armour. Against unarmoured light opponents, even a single bolt may be lethal.
Compared to the ordinary bow, the crossbows have good and bad sides to them. They fire much stronger and much more accurately than ordinary bows, and shooting accurately with a crossbow is easier to learn than shooting with an ordinary bow. On the other hand, because the prod is short and therefore very stiff, a crossbow will take much longer time to load, and a crossbow does not have as good accurate range than an ordinary bow. Many crossbows have crank or windlass mechanisms to pull the string in drawn position. Also many crossbows do have safety mechanisms to prevent an accidental shot.
Crossbow shooting is today a popular sport.

Coeliac disease

Coeliac disease (spelled celiac disease in North America) is an illness which makes people ill if they eat gluten. If someone with coeliac disease eats something with gluten (for example, wheat), cells inside the body attack the lining of the intestine. This means that they cannot digest (eat) food properly, making them unable to have enough energy, vitamins, or minerals. Children may be unable to grow taller or gain weight properly. People with coeliac disease often lose weight. They are also frequently tired. 
People with coeliac disease often have diarrhoea (watery stools) or steatorrhea (fat in their stools). These symptoms can lead to flatulence. Their stomach also hurts and they might suffer from joint pains, seizures, rashes, loss of bone density and fertility issues.
To relieve the effects of coeliac disease, one must stop eating gluten. There are no medicines that can stop coeliac disease. To get fully better, it usually takes about two years of not eating gluten, during which time the previously damaged intestine might recover. They must remain on a gluten-free diet for the rest of their life in order to treat this condition.
Coeliac disease is genetic. This means that the person affected by it is born with genes that cause the immune system to react badly to gluten. However, coeliac disease is not always there during childhood. It can be triggered as an adult by an event such as pregnancy or illness.
To find out if a person has coeliac disease, doctors look in the blood to see if they have the cells that attack the intestine when gluten is eaten. The cell that attacks the intestine is called an antibody. Antibodies normally stop illnesses from growing in the body, but in the case of coeliac disease, one of the antibodies thinks that gluten is something that will cause illness. Doctors can also look into the patient's intestines with a camera on a tube called an endoscope. This can show if the intestines are being or have been damaged, because of coeliac disease.

Pakistan is the second largest Muslim country in terms of population (behind Indonesia). Pakistan is the only Muslim country known to have nuclear weapons. Pakistan is also an important member of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
Pakistan is an active member of the United Nations. Pakistan had some problems with its Foreign relations. Pakistan's relations with its neighbor, India is not good. They have been fighting over the disputed territory of Kashmir,over which it has fought two wars. It has also had difficult relations with Afghanistan and Iran. Pakistan has a long and good relationship with the China. Pakistan has interest over the Persian Gulf and has wide-ranging bilateral relations with the United States and other Western countries.
Pakistan distrusted the Soviet Union during much of the Cold War. Because of this Pakistan had strong relations with both the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. 
It was a member of the American-sponsored CENTO and SEATO military alliances. Its alliance with the United States was especially close after the Soviets invaded the neighboring country of Afghanistan. In 1964, Pakistan signed the Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD) Pact with Turkey and Iran, when all three countries were closely allied with the U.S., and as neighbors of the Soviet Union, wary of perceived Soviet expansionism. To this day, Pakistan has a close relationship with Turkey. RCD became defunct after the Iranian Revolution, and a Pakistani-Turkish initiative led to the founding of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) in 1985. For several years, Pakistan's relations with the Republic of India had been gradually improving, which opened up Pakistan's foreign policy to issues beyond security.

The color Persian blue is named from the blue color of some Persian pottery and the color of tiles used in and on mosques and palaces in Iran and in other places in the Middle East. "Persian blue" is a representation of the color of the mineral lapis lazuli which comes from Persia and Afghanistan. (The color azure is also named after the mineral lapis lazuli.)
The first recorded use of "Persian blue" as a color name in English was in 1669.
The interior of the Shah Mosque in the city of Isfahan in Iran is lavishly decorated with Persian blue colored tiles.

Stellar precession

Stellar precession is the name for one of the ways the stars slowly move across the sky when seen from the Earth. The best-known thing this causes is making the north star's place in the sky slowly change over thousands of years. It is caused by the Sun's gravity pulling the Earth's poles toward itself. Because the Earth's poles are tilted at an angle of 23.42 degrees from straight up in relation to its orbit, this causes the North Pole to seem to point at different places in the sky. 
Although it takes a very long time for the pole to make a whole circle in the sky (almost 26,000 years), even over the time period that humans have had writing, this has made a big difference in what star is seen as the north star. When the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids about 4,000 years ago, they used the stars to make the edges line up with north and south. However, they did not use the same north star that we do because Earth's North Pole pointed at a different star than it does today. 
Astronomers have known about this movement for a very long time. Most people think that Hipparchus discovered it in ancient Greece in about 130 BC, but some people think that even the ancient Egyptians may have known about it.

Harem

Harem means the women and the place where they live in a polygynous household. Most men are not allowed in there. The word "harem" comes from the Turkish word "haram", meaning a sacred, forbidden place. Harems were meant for the royal upbringing of the future wives of noble and royal men. These women would be educated so that they were ready to appear in public as a royal wife. No forms of sexual activity took place inside of harems.
In the west people thought that harems (especially those in the Ottoman Empire) were brothels full of women who gave themselves up to please rich men. 
In modern terms the word maybe used to describe a group of admiring women attracted to one man.

Wikipedia:Very good articles/Gothic architecture

Gothic architecture is a style of architecture, used for buildings in Western Europe, during the Middle Ages. Gothic architecture started in the 12th century, and lasted until the 16th century. Important features of the style are pointed arches, ribbed vaults and flying buttresses.
Today, people associate the style mainly with cathedrals, churches, and abbeys, but it was also used for castles, palaces, universities and some houses. 
Today, many buildings still remain in that style. Smaller ones are thought to be very beautiful, bigger ones are often seen as priceless works of art. 
In the 19th century, the Gothic style became popular again, particularly for building churches and universities. This style is called Gothic Revival architecture.

Just an idea...
Hello everyone. This is my fourth article for Simple News. This time it's going to be about this idea I had. 
Simple Wikipedia needs articles simplifying, but most users (me included) usually make a lot of stubs. I think we should start a wikiproject, with articles needing simplification and do it as a team. It's always easier to do it when you're not alone. Just an idea, but could come in handy, and would make more of our article GA or VGA.

Hello there all! This is the first article that I will be writing for the Simple News section, so let me know if there is anything that I can do to fix things here. Thanks!
Ever since that webcomic on xkcd, we have gotten an increase in both new editors and vandalism. While I am happy about the former, the latter is a bit disturbing. Most people would really like simple to be as vandalism free as it has been in the past year or so, but it is inevitable that our Wikipedia will start to see an increase in vandalism as we grow bigger. Therefore, people with rollback have gotten quite a bit of use out of the rollback tool and that is good, because it will help us to weed out the people who are not able to use the tool well, and will help us patrol vandalism here on the Simple English Wikipedia.
As a side note, I believe that we should allow people to patrol new pages like they allow at the English Wikipedia. That way, people here can look through the new pages and mark the ones that need to be marked for quick deletion. This would help us keep unneeded pages off of the Simple English Wiktionary.
Thanks, and I look forward to writing my next article for you! 19:27, 1 March 2009 (UTC)

Terry Butcher

Terence Ian "Terry" Butcher, born 28 December 1958 in Singapore, is the manager of the Scottish Premier League side Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
He was once a professional player. He played as defender with Ipswich Town and Rangers in the 1980s. He was also a captain of England and won 77 caps in his career of ten years.
He was born in Singapore but spent his childhood in Lowestoft, Suffolk. There he attended The Denes High School. He also met his wife Rita there. He got a chance to join Norwich City youth team, but refused it.
Butcher made his debut for Ipswich against Everton in the First Division on 15 April 1978. Over the next eight seasons, he became the club's central defender. His good performance was noticed by then England coach Ron Greenwood. He gave him his debut in a friendly against Australia in 1980.
In 1981, Butcher played in the Ipswich side that won the UEFA Cup under Bobby Robson. That year the club cape close to its first League title since 1962. However Aston Villa defeated them and won the title.
In 1986, Butcher left Ipswich when they were relegated. He became one of the first 'English invasion' players to join Scottish club Rangers. This was after Graeme Souness became its manager. Souness, the former Liverpool player, paid Ipswich £725,000 for him in July 1986.
As captain, he led them to three League titles in four seasons. They also won two Scottish League Cups.
In November 1987 he broke his leg during Scottish Premier Division fixture against Aberdeen. He could not play for the rest of the season. Before he was injured, Butcher was close to signing a £1million return to England with Manchester United. His injury cancelled this signing. United manager Alex Ferguson signed Norwich City's Steve Bruce instead.
His last Rangers game came in September 1990. Rangers lost 2-1 league against Dundee United in the match. His performance in that match was bad and he was dropped from the side. Leeds United manager Howard Wilkinson talked with Graeme Souness about bringing Butcher back to England, but when Butcher did depart from Ibrox it was in a £400,000 deal to become player-manager of Coventry City on 15 November 1990.

<doc id="169659" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169659" title="Toronto subway and RT">
Toronto subway and RT

The Toronto subway and RT is the main rapid transit (RT) railway system in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is run by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). Since the first part under Yonge Street opened in 1954 with 12 stations, the system has grown to be Canada's biggest rapid transit rail system. It has four lines and 69 stations on 68.3 km of track. The subway system is used very often and has the most number of passengers of any system in Canada. It has an average of 948,100 passenger trips each weekday (as of 2010).
The system is being made bigger at the moment on the western part of the Yonge-University-Spadina Line with new tracks and stations being made north to York University, Steeles Avenue, and Vaughan Corporate Centre in York Region. The Government of Ontario said on March 23, 2006 that it will give $670 million for this new work, which is less than one-third of the total money needed. Once it is built, the new track will be about 8.6 km long and will be built with six new stations: Downsview Park, Finch West, York University, Pioneer Village, Highway 407 Transitway (highway), and the Vaughan Corporate Centre. It is expected to cost about $2 billion. An environmental study has been done up to Steeles Avenue.
The first part of the subway, replaced a very busy streetcar route, and followed Yonge Street from Eglinton Avenue south to Front Street, then turned west for one block to end at Bay Street, next to the city's main railway station Union Station and so the subway station was also called Union. This line was finished in 1954 and was 7.4 km long.
In 1963 another part was added, that went north from Union station, below University Avenue and Queen's Park to near Bloor Street, where it turned west to end at St. George and Bloor Streets.
The Bloor-Danforth Line opened up in 1966 along Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue from Keele Street to Woodbine Avenue, and was made longer in 1968 to run from Islington Avenue to Warden station at Warden and St. Clair Avenues. 
The routing of the line across the Don Valley was possible because of a choice made more than forty years before. When the Prince Edward Viaduct was built across the Don River in 1919, its design included twin decks below the road to allow for future rail lines. This made it possible for the subway to cross the Don Valley to Danforth Avenue on the east side.
The Yonge-University line was extended north 8.7 km from Eglinton Avenue to Finch Avenue and Yonge in 1973 and 1974.
More track (9.9 km) was added to the Yonge-University Line in 1978 when it was extended from St. George and Bloor, north and northwest to Eglinton Avenue and Allen Road, then north along the middle of Allen Road to Wilson Avenue. 
In October 1976, an arson (a fire set on purpose) destroyed subway cars and damage to Christie station. This caused the closure of the Bloor-Danforth Line for three days, and closed Christie station for some time for repairs. More track was added in 1980 at both ends of the Bloor-Danforth Line. These extensions each added one station, bus bays, and, on the eastern end, room to to the Scarborough RT.
With six stations on 6.8 km of track, the Scarborough RT is a line built almost all above the ground, and which has no direct tracks that connect to the other lines and uses a different trains. It uses the Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS) trains which are very different from subway trains. The route is fully separate from road traffic and pedestrians, the stations are fully covered, and the trains have many doors that use high platforms. 
An extra 1.6 km was added to the north end of the Spadina part of the Yonge-University-Spadina Line, adding one station (Downsview), with parking for buses. 
In August 1995, the TTC had a really bad subway accident in what it calls the Russell Hill accident, on the Yonge-University-Spadina Line south of St. Clair West station. Three women died and 100 people were injured, a few badly. 
The subway's newest line, Sheppard, opened in 2002. It runs 5.5 km east, under Sheppard Avenue from Sheppard station on the Yonge line (now called Sheppard-Yonge), to Don Mills station at Sheppard and Don Mills Road. The Sheppard line has less users than the other two subway lines, and shorter trains run on it.
In its over fifty-year history, the first baby to be born on a TTC subway station platform only occurred recently on February 6, 2006. This incident occurred at Wellesley station and caused delays on the subway system. It was front-page news for many days.
An automatic voice system was added to each station (such as; "The next station is Bloor, Bloor station.") which ended the need for the train operator to announce each stop. The automated system is used in the whole subway and RT system.
Until recently, the TTC did not have plans to expand the subway during the last twenty years but only had plans to build new above-ground rapid transit lines based upon streetcars travelling in closed lanes on streets. Today there are plans to build new subway lines under the ground, including extensions to the Spadina-University line and two lines in the central section of the city south of Bloor-Danforth.
Like most subways, the Toronto subway/RT trains get electricity from a third rail that runs next to the tracks. 'Shoes' (pieces of metal that touch the third-rail) mounted on both sides of each coach for contact. Power is supplied at 600 V DC.
A train guard opens and closes the subway car doors, and makes sure no one is trapped in a door as the train leaves a station. The train guard tells the driver when it is okay to leave. The car carrying the guard can be identified by the white or the orange light outside the subway car. 
On weekdays and Saturday, subway service runs from approximately 6:00 am to 1:30 am, but Sunday service begins at 9:00 am. Start times on holidays may vary.
"For complete lists and details of stations, lines, and their locations in the Toronto subway/RT system, see List of Toronto subway and RT stations."
Most stations are named for the nearby road crossed by the line in question. A few are named for major landmarks, such as shopping centres or other transportation stations near the station. 
All trains stop at every station along their route and run the entire length of their line from end to end.

Tar

Tar is a sticky black liquid made of thick oil. It is a natural substance, oozing out of the ground in places like the La Brea tar pits. Usually it is made by heating coal inside a chemical apparatus.
Most tar is produced from coal as a byproduct of coke production, but it can also be produced from petroleum, peat or wood. The "destructive distillation" of a ton of coal can produce 700 kg of coke, 100 litres of liquor ammonia, 50 litres of coal tar and 400 m of coal gas.
It used to be one of the products of gasworks. Tar made from coal or petroleum is considered toxic. It causes cancer because of its high benzene content. In low concentrations, however, tar is used as a medicine on the skin. 
Tar kilns are dry destillation ovens, used in Scandinavia for producing tar from wood. They were built close to the forest, from limestone or from more primitve holes in the ground. The bottom is sloped into an outlet hole, to allow the tar to pour out. The wood is split to dimensions of a finger and stacked densely, and finally covered tight with dirt and moss to stop air entering. On top of this, a fire is stacked and lit. After a few hours, the tar starts to pour out, and continues to do so for a few days.
Tar is used in treatment of the skin disease psoriasis, where coal tar is the most effective. Tar is a general disinfectant. Petroleum tar was also used in ancient Egyptian mummification circa 1000 BC.
Tar was a vital component of the first sealed, or "tarmac", roads. The streets of Baghdad were the first to be paved with tar from the 8th century AD. It was also used as seal for roofing shingles and to seal the hulls of ships and boats. For millennia wood tar was used to waterproof sails and boats, but today sails made from inherently waterproof synthetic substances have negated the need for tar. Wood tar is still used to seal traditional wooden boats and the roofs of historical shingle-roofed churches, as well painting exterior walls of log buildings. 
Mixing tar with linseed oil varnish produces tar paint. Tar paint can be used to protect wood from weather. Tar paint can also be toned with various pigments, producing translucent colours and preserving the wood texture.

Toronto Transit Commission

The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) runs the public transport system that has buses, streetcars, subways, and rapid transit lines in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Started in 1954, the TTC has grown to three subway lines and an elevated rapid transit line with a total of 69 stations, as well as 149 surface routes (buses and streetcars). Of these 149 routes 148 make 243 connections with a subway or rapid transit station during weekday rush hours.
The TTC operates the third most used urban public transport system in North America (after the New York City Transit Authority and the Mexico City Metro). 
The TTC also runs a door-to-door "(they pick people up at home, the shops or work, and take them anywhere they wish to go)" system for people with physical disabilities known as Wheel-Trans; about 5,500 trips are made by this service daily. This service costs the same as any other trip on the TTC even though it is door-to-door. The TTC had 11,235 people working for it in 2007.

Viscosity

Viscosity is a physical property of fluids. It shows resistance to flow. In a simple example, water has a low viscosity, as it is 'thin'. Syrup or tar, on the other hand has a high viscosity, as it is 'thick, So next time you drink something think about the viscosity!. A way to test for viscosity is the speed at which the substance runs down a slope. Syrup would reach the bottom very slowly, whereas water would be a lot quicker.
There are two types of viscosity: "dynamic viscosity", measured in pascal seconds, and "kinematic viscosity", measured in metres per second squared.
Viscosity is used as a way to predict when volcanoes erupt. When the lava comes out very thickly (viscous), there is more chance that it will erupt violently. This is because the lava has a hard time getting out and may burst out when it can. If the lava is thin (low viscosity), then it just flows out like water.
The word "viscous" comes from the Latin "viscum", meaning sticky.

Additions to Daniel

The Additions to Daniel are three chapters that are in some but not all Christian Bibles, added to the Book of Daniel. Roman Catholics and followers of the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches believe that these chapters are sacred and they put them in their Bibles as part of their Biblical canon. The chapters are listed in "Article VI" of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England as good but not sacred reading. Most Protestant Bibles do not have these chapters because most Protestant churches believe these chapters are apocryphal.
The Additions to Daniel are not found in the Hebrew or Aramaic text of Daniel. These stories are in the Greek Septuagint and a translation by the writer Theodotion. However, most Protestant Bibles use only the text in the Hebrew and Aramaic manuscripts, so they do not have these chapters.

Tenrikyo is a religion that believes in one God. It was founded in Japan in the 19th century by Miki Nakayama, a Japanese woman who heard instructions from God. Believers of Tenrikyo call her "Oyasama", which means the "Great Parent", because she acts as a parent to all people. In Tenrikyo, God is called "Oyagami", which means "God the Parent".
The goal of Tenrikyo is for all people to live a joyous life. Oyasama stated that the way to save yourself is by saving others. In other words, to be truly happy you must make other people happy.
Today, Tenrikyo is centered in Tenri City in central Japan. There is a general hospital, a college, three schools, and a central temple there. Once a month, there is a big ritual in this central city and many people come from all over the country to pray. There are two million believers of Tenrikyo in Japan and around the world.

Steeles Avenue is an east-west street that forms the northern city border of Toronto and the southern border of York Region, Ontario, Canada. It is 38.75 km within Toronto, between Albion Road and the Scarborough-Pickering border.
West of Albion Road, Steeles continues into Peel Region, where it is also known as Peel Regional Road 15. It runs through Brampton and into the Halton Region town of Milton. It stops at Appleby Line on top of the Niagara Escarpment due to the Crawford Lake Conservation Area being there, and then the road starts again just east of Guelph Line and goes until the Milborough Townline on the border of Milton and Hamilton. East of the Toronto-Pickering border, it becomes Taunton Road.
Steeles is named after J. C. Steele, who owned a tavern on the street where it joins with Yonge Street.
Steeles Avenue was listed as the worst road by the CAA in October 2006, and as the fifth worst road in October 2007. In October 2008, it was re-listed as worst road in Ontario. Reasons are potholes and the quality of the road. Soon after the CAA's listing, some parts of the road between Dufferin Street and Bayview Avenue were resurfaced.

Hey all,
I've come back after my month's absence :)
Just wondering if people could fill me in on anything important that's happened in that time and also to check i'm ok to jump in where i left off, nominally DYK, Simple News, Bot Running and article writing ;) (I hear the Wikicup has been cancelled so i've left that out ;) 
It's good to be back :)
Thanks,
I made a small change to the warning template (diff) because, as a native English speaker, I found it difficult to understand. I believe the word "practice" is easy to understand by people with a simple command of English, while the current wordage ("try out changing") is not. Furthermore, the second comma is necessary to maintain proper separation of that phrase. Thoughts? () 18:48, 26 February 2009 (UTC)
I'm proposing the addition of standard optional questions in RFAs. Some people know them from EN: What will you do with the tools, what do you think are your best contributions and have you been in any major conflicts. I think that they would be a help in evaluating the candidate at RFA.
Hello, is there a version of Twinkle on Simple Wikipedia? The Twinkle script or gadget makes it easier to mark pages for deletion and warn vandals. Thank you. 23:37, 26 February 2009 (UTC)
I just noticed pop up around here. I am highly suspicious that he is connected to the Sunholm/Sunfazer/SunStar vandal who has socked at and been banned from numerous wikis (particularly en.). A good discussion of his history can be found here on en.. According to Lar, a checkuser on en., this user is a perpetual problem globally.
The Sunstar NW XP vandal here is following patterns of the other examples of this vandal: a love for templates as well as a "I know vandals, I share IPs with vandals, but I'm not a vandal" defense that basically every other Sunholm related vandal has claimed. Because of this being a global issue (it's not just an en. ban, this stretches beyond just en.), I propose that we ban Sunstar NW XP and any current and future versions of this vandal. () 13:20, 22 February 2009 (UTC)
In this case, I would think about giving him a one-strike rule. If he doesn't change, I a ban on him. -- 08:02, 23 February 2009 (UTC)
Can we get an admin to implement the ban here? Checkuser has confirmed it, and consensus seems to be leaning towards ban. Thanks, () 16:32, 26 February 2009 (UTC)
English should be written simple but difficult concepts are allowed, here... naturally though there will be unsimple words in the article which don't comply with strict Basic English limitations. Is there any way around this or would just doing everything appropriately (wikt: etc.) be enough? -- 23:58, 26 February 2009 (UTC)
Why is it when I write a flag and then write after the flag Afghanistan, it shows the word at the bottom of the flag, not at the top? Afghanistan Why can't you make the word written "next to the flag", like any other Wikipedia does? () 17:27, 28 February 2009 (UTC)
Now that is now ready for testing on small and medium wikis, I want to make a proposal for installing it on this wiki. Anyone want it? I'll put a configuration here to start. It's incomplete, but it can be changed. 02:25, 25 February 2009 (UTC)

I'm not comfortable with having the abuse filter deal with general vandalism. From my personal experience with admin/antivandal bots safely detecting general vandalism is much much harder than just serial vandalism. If this was only to be used for serial vandals (do we even have any?) I might support it, but detecting any vandalism more than just a new user blanking a page, causes to much false positives. I'm also still not convinced of your technical ability to safely use the filter. -- 02:44, 28 February 2009 (UTC)
I've posted a configuration to be applied when we want Abuse Filter to be installed. Change this if there's a change in the proposal. 01:13, 28 February 2009 (UTC)
Well I just ran into the abuse filter on another wiki. Won't let me create my user page because the letters "ass" are in my username...*sigh* I hate when webpages do that to me. That being said I think it will let me once I am autoconfirmed. - () 17:47, 28 February 2009 (UTC)
I'd like to propose that the current mainpage VGA always be semi-protected against IP vandalism for the duration of its being on the mainpage. The VGA on the mainpage alway's gets a good amount of vandalism and it seems prudent that whatever the current VGA on the mainpage is, it should always be semi-protected. 02:35, 25 February 2009 (UTC)
My viewpoint here is that the VGA linked to the mainpage always gets a lot of vandalism. Almost always from IP editors. If we were to semi this page it would lessen the amount of vandalism and hence the disruption to the project. Whilst, Wikipedia is indeed the encyclopedia that anyone can edit, it might be prudent to protect the pages that receive the most amount of vandalism. Sniper has received a lot of unneeded edits and vandalism this week; as does every other currently offered VGA on the mainpage. It's something to consider, at least. 02:47, 25 February 2009 (UTC)
My opinion is that we protect these articles way too quickly as it is. Sniper has been a rare exception where I'd actually say that the vandalism was in excess. For the most part, though, we're protecting when we can just revert and block and move on. () 03:07, 25 February 2009 (UTC)

At the top of Recent changes, I think link next to Simplification should be removed and use a list of Complex pages rather than long as the examples shown. I suggest this because long does not mean complex. () 09:56, 28 February 2009 (UTC)
I understand that simple English Wikipedia has a number of articles on simple words. But for articles such as upstaging, which should really be tidied up and then moved to :wikt:simple:upstage, is there a process to do that? doesn't really explain how to do so unless you're an admin on the receiving wiki, and only enWP has . () 21:47, 28 February 2009 (UTC)
The above page is "very" out of date, with the dates not updated since November 08. Can anyone remember what was up when, or is there a way to work it out?
If not, do we really need the columns of when they were displayed? They are in a rotation after all...
Furthermore, there are two articles not yet into rotation, which I will get into the rotation shortly, but for this two would need to be lost: the two that have been in the longest?
Finally, shouldn't all the articles be in rotation at the same time? It really doesn't matter when they get shown and when...
Sorry for the jumbledness of that post - i'm still working on about 4 hours of sleep!
If you need anything explaining, just ask!

Hello all. I found out about the Simple English wikipedia from xkcd, and I am very new here. However I very much like the idea and find it fun and relaxing to edit those articles I am qualified to edit.
I have been editting the physics articles with a slant on astronomy/particle physics. Today, I started editing the article on Neutron Stars and came across an issue I'm not sure what to do about and about which I can find no guidance in any of the Simple English wikipedia pages and I would like some help on it.
The issue is maths and what place it has in this wikipedia.
In writing the Neutron Star article, I started on a section about their rotation. In writing about their rotation, I remembered that there was a lovely, simple and very educational argument about how to work out their maximum rotation speed. It's a back of the envelope calculation, as we scientists would call it, an argument that focuses on giving an idea of what's going on rather than any real truth, well within the scope of any older secondary school student in the United Kingdom studying their A-levels and something exciting that shows them that even simple A-level physics can be used on something as complicated and exotic as neutron stars.
In terms of this wikipedia's understanding at a simple level to foreign speakers, it's nice but not really necessary and would probably only confuse, as I can explain the crux of what's going on well enough with words without using the maths.
In terms of writing an accurate article, a back of the envelope calculation is not really very appropriate and they do not seem to appear in the main English wikipedia. 
In terms of writing an informative article, I think it's a very valid showing what's happening.
I'm confused about exactly which part of this wikipedia's mission takes precedence over others and where I should be pitching my article.
Also, if I to write the educational section, it would be nice to have some way of flagging it as educational only and also some way of flagging the level of education needed, in a way that is internationally understood.
Are LGBT articles here allowed, or is it "taboo" since many children read the Simple wiki? I would like to create California Proposition 8 () and possibly Hawaii House Bill 444 (), but I don't want to anger anybody, so I'm asking the community for permission. Cheers, 04:54, 3 March 2009 (UTC)

I believe that DYK is in its last breaths, and I'm beginning to believe that this is a failed experiment. It has been updated once in the last month, and the nomination page doesn't show much activity. Some say it is not dying, just inactive at the moment, however, I feel like it is something that is on its way out. Like the Wiki Cup, it was strong for a bit, but trickled down. Perhaps it is time to consider letting it go the way of the Wiki Cup? () 21:30, 2 March 2009 (UTC)
It used to be so much easier. You would find a decent article, find a hook, thats it. Now it has to be of a certain length, and VGA's are no longer allowed. Its become increasingly difficult to find an article you can use. 16:21, 3 March 2009 (UTC)

Good work. Perhaps now those editors interested in the PVGA process could be tempted into discussing how to fix it from its currently poor format? While I'm not around for another few weeks, it would be interesting to see if other editors find the system to be broken. The most recently promoted article, Romania has many, many outstanding issues on the talk page but since it received the 6-0 precise minimum, it is now considered to be one of finest articles. Which it isn't. As a starter, I think we need to reconsider the precise 6-0/85% threshold (as it is gloriously flawed - an article with 5 supports and no opposes is not promoted while an article with 5 supports and one oppose is promoted for example) and we need to reconsider the one week threshold, although that is not so pressing. Why not consider that a bureaucrat (whose job on this Wikipedia is very simple right now, no need to actually think, they just need to follow the % guidelines to the letter) could review the votes and make a decision accordingly?

Tim Hortons

Tim Hortons Inc. is a Canadian fast food restaurant known for its coffee and doughnuts. It was started in 1964 in Hamilton, Ontario by Canadian hockey player Tim Horton. In 1967 Tim Horton joined with investor Ron Joyce, who quickly took over running the company and expanded the chain into a multi-million dollar franchise. 
Tim Hortons stores quickly spread and together with Subway, became bigger than McDonald's and is now Canada's largest chain of fast food restaurants. The company opened twice as many Canadian stores as did McDonald's and sales also are bigger than those of McDonald's Canadian restaurants as of 2002. The chain got 22.6% of all fast food industry revenues in Canada in 2005. Tim Hortons also has 76% of the Canadian market for baked goods (based on the number of customers) and has 62% of the Canadian coffee market (compared to Starbucks, who is the second largest with 7%). Tim Hortons had 2,733 restaurants in Canada as of July 1, 2007. 
Tim Hortons also has an international restaurants with 500 in the United States as of December 2008, with one opened in Detroit and owned by former NBA player Derrick Coleman and one on a Canadian military base outside Kandahar, Afghanistan. Tim Hortons' other international efforts include a small outlet at the Dublin Zoo. Tim Hortons also made a deal with the SPAR store chain in the UK and Ireland, with Tim Hortons coffee and doughnuts being sold at small self service counters in 16 SPAR stores. 
The companies first store opened in 1964 in Hamilton, Ontario under the name "Tim Horton Donuts" (the word donut would later be dropped and the company name ended up as just "Tim Horton's", and later was changed to "Tim Hortons" without the apostrophe). The business was started by Tim Horton, who played in the National Hockey League from 1949 until his death in a car accident in 1974.
Soon after Horton opened the store, he met Ron Joyce, a former Hamilton police constable. In 1965, Joyce took over the Tim Horton Donut Shop on Ottawa Street North in Hamilton. By 1967, after he had opened up two more stores, he and Tim Horton became full partners in the business. After Horton's death in 1974, Joyce bought the company from the Horton family and took over as the only owner of the now forty stores. Joyce expanded the chain quickly in geography and in product selection, opening the 500th store in Aylmer, Quebec, in 1991.
Ron Joyce's very fast expansion of the Tim Hortons business brought about two major changes in the coffee and doughnut restaurant market: independent doughnut shops in Canada were almost wiped out, and Canada's per person ratio of doughnut shops rose past those of all other countries.
By the 1990s, the company name had changed to The TDL Group Ltd but the name of the restaurants are still called Tim Hortons. This was because the company wanted to also go into other types of business, and not just be seen as a doughnut company. In March 2006, shares of the company were first sold to the public.
TDL Group had $1.48 billion in sales in 2005 and has expanded across Canada and also in New York, Ohio, Michigan, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Maine.
Tim Hortons has many stores on or near many Canadian Forces Bases. TDL Group said in March 2006, that because they were asked by Chief of the Defence Staff, General Rick Hillier, it would open a store at the Canadian Forces operations base in Kandahar, Afghanistan. The new Kandahar store opened on June 29 2006, in a 40 ft trailer on the military base.
(Source: Tim Hortons Official History)
Tim Hortons' first stores only sold two products - coffee and doughnuts. As well as its coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and doughnuts, the Tim Hortons menu now includes a number of other baked goods, such as Timbits (small balls of doughnut dough), muffins, croissants, tea biscuits, cookies, rolls, danishes, and bagels (which Tim Hortons now sells one out of every two bagels in the whole Canadian food industry). Cakes to take home are offered in some locations. 
Since the mid-1990s, the chain has moved into other areas, such as flavoured cappuccino, iced cappuccino, iced coffee, New York-style cheesecake, and lunch items such as soup, chili, and submarine sandwiches. In fall 2006, Tim Hortons began selling a breakfast sandwich. This is made of an egg patty, processed cheese slice, either bacon or sausage, and either a biscuit or bagel, it has sold well. In October 2007 Tim Hortons began to sell a Chicken Fajita Wrap, which has spiced chicken and sautéed vegetables. In December 2007, they began to sell Hash Browns and the Bagel B.E.L.T., (a breakfast sandwich that has lettuce and tomato.
Along with the expansion of stores and the expanded menu came the outsourcing of baked goods. Doughnuts, which used to be made at night so that they were ready for the next morning, are now fully cooked and then frozen and sent to every restaurant from Windsor Ontario. The restaurants now bake them during the day.
The company used to sell Coca-Cola products but Tim Hortons switched over to Pepsi in 2007.
Throw away cups made by the company are one of the most common litter items in Canada. Company spokespersons claim that customers are the problem, not Tim Hortons.
In May 2008, the chain came under fire after an employee in London, Ontario was fired for giving away a single $0.16 Timbit to a baby. A manager was blamed for the . The employee was hired at a different nearby location.

Ice cube

Ice cubes are small, cube-shaped parts of ice. These pieces are sometimes used to cool drinks. Ice cubes are used in mixed drinks, when the drink has the words "on the rocks."
Ice cubes are made by filling a tray with water and putting it in a freezer. Many freezers also have an icemaker. Icemakers make ice cubes and put them in a bin. After that, they can be put in a glass.
Ice cubes are also made commercially and sold in big amounts. These ice cubes are usually cylindrical, and might have holes through the center. Commercially made ice cubes are very clear, as the water doesn't have much air dissolved in it.
Ice cubes can also be crushed into different-shaped flakes, which some people think makes some kinds of cocktails look better. Crushed ice is also used when it needs to be made fast, because the speed of cooling depends on the amount and average radius of the ice particles.
American physician and humanitarian John Gorrie built a refrigerator in 1844 to be able to cool air. His refrigerator made ice, which he hung from the ceiling in a basin. Gorrie is the creator of ice cubes, even though he was not trying to cool drinks. Instead, he used the ice to cool the room's temperature. During that time, people thought that bad air quality made people sick. So, to help treat sickness, he advocated for the draining of swamps and the cooling of sickrooms.
Ice cube trays are designed to be filled with water, then put in a freezer until the water freezes to ice, thus creating ice cubes. Trays are often flexible, so the ice cubes can be removed easily by flexing the tray. Another design is an aluminum tray with a lever that raises the ice cubes up, moving them off of the tray. A motorized kind of this is in most automatic ice-making freezers.
Even though ice cubes are usually shaped like cubes, there are trays that make spherical or cylindrical shapes. These are sometimes called ice tubes. Some novelty trays make blocks of ice in seasonal, festive, or other shapes.
The first flexible, stainless steel, all-metal ice cube tray was made by Guy L. Tinkham in 1933. The tray bent sideways to remove the ice cubes.
The first rubber ice cube tray was made by Lloyd Groff Copeman. One day in 1928, while walking through some woods getting sap for maple syrup, Copeman saw that slush and ice came off of his rubber boots instead of sticking to them. After talking about it with his patent attorney at lunch, he did experiments using rubber cups. Later, he made and patented several kinds of tray: a metal tray with rubber separators, a metal tray with individual rubber cups, and a tray made of only rubber.

Machete

A machete is a long cutting tool. The blade is usually 20-24 inches (50-60 cm) long and less than .2 inches thick. The machete is a large knife often used in jungles because it can easily cut through plants and vines. It can be used to open coconuts and cut down small trees (sometimes the back side has edges for sawing wood). It is also used occasionally outside of jungles. One such use is in surveying when a line of sight is needed through brush. It is a lot like the Japanese katana and larger than the American Bowie knife, and is sometimes used in warfare.

King Lear

King Lear is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare. He based it on an old British story about a king named Leir or Lyr. The play might have been first performed in December 1606. It was first printed in 1608. It was printed again in 1623 in the First Folio. This is a collection of all of Shakespeare's plays. Many great actors over the years have played the part of King Lear. 
The play is about an old king named Lear. He wants to divide his land between his three daughters. To get the land, they must tell him how much they love him. His youngest daughter Cordelia will not say how much she does. 
She says words will not be able to describe her love. Lear gets angry at her and will not give her land, and says she is not his daughter anymore. He gives his land to his other daughters Regan and Goneril. 
The king soon finds out that Regan and Goneril do not love him. They only wanted his land. Lear becomes very mad. The two daughters, and their husbands, throw him out of the land that is now theirs. The rest of the play is about Lear's trip around the land that was once his as he becomes insane.

<doc id="169900" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169900" title="Mutual information">
Mutual information

Mutual information measures how much more is known about one random value when given another. For example, knowing the temperature of a random day of the year will not reveal what month it is, but it will give some "hint". In the same way, knowing what month it is will not reveal the exact temperature, but will make certain temperatures "more or less likely". These "hints" or "changes in likelihood" are explained and measured with mutual information.
To calculate mutual information, the probability (chance) of all possible events, and the probability of them happening at the same time, is needed. For example, to measure mutual information between month and temperature we would need to know how many days in the year are 10 degrees Celsius, how many days out of the year are March and finally how many days are 10 degrees Celsius in March.
The formula requires the summation, or adding up, of many terms or numbers. Every possible outcome has its own term. From the above calculation of mutual information between month and temperature, we will use the following variables:
This means m(3) equals the probability of a randomly selected day being in March. This is 31/365, or about 0.085, since 31 out of 365 days in the year are in March.
One term would be as follows:
In this formula, "log" means logarithm.
Adding all possible terms together gives the value for mutual information.
The larger the mutual information, the more you can learn about one random value (e.g. month) when told another (e.g. temperature).
Mutual information does not change based on which random value is revealed. This means we know just as much about "temperature when told the month" as we know about "the month when told the temperature".
Mutual information is difficult to compare. If we calculate mutual information for weather and another value for a card game, the two values cannot easily be compared.

The Tillamook are a Native American tribe from the state of Oregon. The word "Tillamook" means "people of Nekelim" in the Chinook language. Also, Tillamook can mean "Land of Many Waters" but it is not as widely used. Tillamook can also be spelled Calamox, Gillamooks, and Killamook.
The Tillamook tribe used to speak Tillamook. After a while they learned to speak English. The last person that spoke Tillamook died in 1970. This made the Tillamook language gone forever. Starting in 1965, a group of scientists tried to protect the Tillamook language by talking with the Tillamook people and creating a Tillamook language dictionary.
The Tillamook tribe used to live between the Necanicum River and Tillamook Bay. The Tillamook were coastal Native Americans. Their name, Tillamook, means "Land of Many Waters" in their language.

Recently at the Simple English Wikipedia' activity has been shifting from one community process to another. You may remember last issue I wrote about our PVGA and PGA processes. I'm pleased to report that these processes are no being regularly updated by our community members.
However, it seems that this has taken a toll on our DYK? section which has now become very dormant! The hooks haven't been updated in over a week now and very few on the page have been reviewed. Unfortunately as these are community processes, and also one that ultimately ends up on our Main Page, one individual cannot run the process them by themself!
Now, i'm not saying ditch GA and VGA, as that would then be going full circle - but how about all three?
Think about it: it really doesn't take that long to check over an article for the DYK criteria, and it takes even less time to nominate an article!
So, why not? DYK is the perfect opportunity to get your favourite article featured on the Main Page without having to do lots of work on it to get it to a VGA standard.
Interested? Head over to and nominate or discuss some hooks!

At the time when it was found, Huya was the biggest and brightest TNO yet found. It was found using data collected by at the CIDA Observatory in Venezuela. Astronomers think it's about 530 km in diameter.
The object has a red-sloped reflectance spectrum, saying that the surface could be rich in organic material such as tholins.
Given the long orbit that TNOs have around the sun, Huya comes to opposition in early May of each year at an apparent magnitude of 19.3.

2101 Adonis was one of the first near-Earth asteroids to be found. It was found by Eugene Delporte in 1936 and named after Adonis, the beautiful youth with whom the goddess Venus fell in love. Adonis is thought to measure about 1 km in diameter.
In the close approach that led to the first time it was found, not enough sightings could be made to find out it's orbit, and Adonis was lost until 1977 when it was found once again by Charles T. Kowal.
Adonis was the second Apollo asteroid to be found (after 1862 Apollo itself). It may be a dead comet, and may be the source of some meteor showers. 
It comes within 30 Gm of the Earth six times in the 21st century, the nearest being 5.3 Gm in 2036.

1566 Icarus

1566 Icarus is an Apollo asteroid (a sub-class of near-Earth asteroid). At its closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) it is closer to the Sun than Mercury. In its orbit it crosses the orbits of Mercury, Venus and Mars. It is named after Icarus of Greek mythology, who flew too close to the Sun. The asteroid was found in 1949 by Walter Baade.
Icarus makes a close approach to Earth at gaps of 9, 19, or 38 years. Sometimes, it comes as close as 6.4 Gm (16 lunar distances and 4 million miles), as it did on June 14, 1968. The last close approach was in 1996, at 15.1 Gm, almost 40 times as far as the Moon. The next close approach will be June 16, 2015 at 8.1 Gm (5 million miles).
In 1967, Paul Sandorff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology gave his students the task of making a plan to destroy Icarus, if it was going to hit the Earth. This plan is known as Project Icarus (which was the basis for the 1979 science fiction film Meteor, starring Sean Connery).

3200 Phaethon, sometimes incorrectly spelt Phaeton, is an Apollo asteroid and a dead comet.
It was announced on 14 October 1983 in IAUC 3878, with optical confirmation that it looks like an asteroid. It was the first asteroid to be found by a spacecraft. It measures 5.10 km in diameter. 
Phaethon approaches the Sun closer than any other numbered asteroid. Its perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) is only 0.140 AU – less than half Mercury's perihelion distance. It is a Mercury-, Venus-, Earth- and Mars-crosser. The surface temperature at perihelion could reach ~1025 K, or 1400 F. For this reason, it was named after the Greek myth of Phaëton, son of the sun god Helios.
Phaethon approached to 18.1 Gm on 10 December 2007. It will draw nearer in 2017, 2050, 2060, and closer still on 14 December 2093, passing within 0.0198 AU (3.0  Gm).

Minor planet designation

Minor planet designations are number-name combinations given by the Minor Planet Center, a part of the IAU. They are used for dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies such as asteroids, but not comets. They are given to a body once its orbit is secured, and are unrelated to provisional designations, which are given when an object is found. 
The two parts of a formal designation are 
It looks like this: codice_1, for example (90377) Sedna or . The brackets are now often removed, as in 90377 Sedna, according to what the astronomer wants. In practice, however, for any reasonably well-known object the number is mostly a catalogue entry, and the name or provisional designation is generally used in place of the formal designation: Sedna, .
The rule for moons of minor planets, such as the formal designation (87) Sylvia I Romulus for the asteroid moon Romulus, is an extension of the Roman numeral convention that had been used, on and off, for the moons of the planets since Galileo's time. 
Comets are also managed by the Minor Planet Center, but use a different cataloguing system.
By 1851, there were 15 asteroids, all but one with their own symbol. The symbols were becoming less and less simple, and, as they had to be drawn by hand, astronomers found some of them hard to draw. This difficulty was addressed by Benjamin Apthorp Gould in 1851, who suggested numbering asteroids in the order that they were found, and placing this number in a circle as the symbol for the asteroid, such as ④ for the fourth asteroid, Vesta. This practice was soon coupled with the name itself into an official number-name designation, "④ Vesta", as the number of minor planets increased. By "ca" 1858, the circle had been simplified to brackets, "(4)" and "(4) Vesta", which was easier to typeset. Other punctuation such as "4) Vesta" and "4, Vesta" was also used, but had more or less completely died out by 1949.
The major exception to the convention that the number tracks the order they were or the order that they're orbit was calculated is the case of Pluto. Since Pluto was originally called a planet, it was not given a number until a 2006 redefinition of "planet" that didn't include it. At that point, Pluto was given the formal designation (134340) Pluto.

There was a kind-hearted old man, Hanasaka-jiisan, who grew cherry blossoms. The old man and his wife had a white puppy. One day, their dog barked, “Koko-hore-wan-wan,” (meaning "Dig here! Bark bark!") while digging in a field. The old man dug up gold and made the old man very rich. The old man was very happy. The old man's neighbor saw the dog barking and watched as the old man dig up the treasure. The old couple’s neighbors were jealous of this. So they stole the white puppy away, and ordered him to search for treasure. They beat him, then he went to search for treasure. But they only found rubbish. So, then they killed the dog. The old man was crushed with grief. The neighbor's gave the old man and his wife the dog's ashes. 
Then, the dog appeared in the old man's dream. The dog said, "Please scatter my ashes on the dead cherry blossom tree!" The old man followed the dog's directions. Then, the dead cherry blossom tree came into full bloom. The old man and his wife received great praise from a feudal lord passing by.

Mono no aware

Mono no aware (物の哀れ) is a Japanese literary term. It means "the pathos of things" in English. Pathos is the power in literature that creates feelings of sorrow, pity and tenderness. Mono no aware is a very important concept when reading old literature, so that the reader can understand the importance and beauty of the literature. It is used to express the keen emotion and pathos of a piece of literature and the feeling it gives the readers' senses, such as the description of a sound or scenery. "The Tale of Genji", said to be the world's oldest novel, is a good example of literature that gives its readers the sense of "mono no aware".
The term "mono no aware" was first used by Motoori Norinaga (1730-1801) to describe Heian Period (794 AD - 1185 AD) literature, especially "Tales of Genji".
Notable manga artists who use "mono no aware"–style storytelling include Hitoshi Ashinano, Kozue Amano, and Kaoru Mori. In anime, both Only Yesterday, by Isao Takahata and Mai Mai Miracle, by Sunao Katabuchi make note of the passing of time in a gentle way by presenting the main plot against a parallel one from the past. In addition, the Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu was well known for making a sense of "mono no aware".

Saddle

A saddle is like a seat for a rider, which is held to an animal's back by a belly strap called a girth. The most common type is the equestrian saddle made for a horse. Saddles have been made for camels and other animals. The earliest saddles were simple pads fixed with a surcingle seen by 800 BC, with the saddle tree coming into use about 200 BC, and paired stirrups by 322 AD Saddles in use today, date back to the 1700s. Today, modern saddles come in different styles, designed for different equestrian activities. They need careful fit for both the rider and the horse. Proper saddle care can extend the useful life of a saddle, often for many years.
The two most common saddle types used for horse riding are the English saddle and the Western saddle. The English saddle is used for horse sports like show jumping, dressage, and eventing. It is also used for horse showing. It has less leather and is lighter than most Western saddles. 
The Western saddle is used for horse activities where the rider must work cows. It is also used for showing and barrel racing. The biggest difference is it has a horn on the front. This was used originally for tying the rope to, so when a cow was roped it would be tied to the saddle.
The there are many different types of English and Western saddles. All are designed for a specific purpose. So while they might look different, they all help the rider for the sport or activity for which they were designed. For example, a rider would not want to jump in a Western saddle because the horn would make it hard for them to stay in the correct position over the jump. A rider would not want to work cows in a jumping saddle because they would not have a horn and because the Western saddle puts the rider in a better position for working cows.

Bridle

A bridle is a piece of equipment used to direct and control a horse. The bridle includes the headstall (that goes around the horse's head) and holds a bit that goes in the mouth of a horse, and also the reins that are joined to the bit. 
A headstall without a bit uses a noseband to control a horse, is called a hackamore, or a bitless bridle. There are many different designs with many different names, but all use a noseband that puts pressure on sensitive areas of the animal's face in order to provide direction and control.
A bridle as said in a dictionary is a piece of equipment that helps contral a horse.
In the poem "The Man From Snowy River" by Banjo Paterson it says "He never drew the "bridle" till he landed safe and sound," This is talking about the same thing.

University of Arizona

The University of Arizona (also known as UA, or Arizona) is a public research university in Tucson, Arizona.
The school began in 1885. It was the first university in the Arizona Territory. The school also includes the Banner – University Medical Center Tucson. This is a four-year M.D. college in downtown Phoenix.
The mission of the University of Arizona is, "To improve the prospects and enrich the lives of the people of Arizona and the world through education, research, creative expression, and community and business partnerships." 
Arizona is one of the elected members of the Association of American Universities (an organization for research institutions). It is the only school from Arizona in the group.
The sports teams are nicknamed the "Arizona Wildcats" (often shortened to "Cats"). They got the name from a 1914 football game with the California champions at the time, Occidental College. The Los Angeles Times said that, "the Arizona men showed the fight of wildcats." Sports are a big part of campus life at the school and they get a large amount of money to operate the programs.
They are members of the Pacific-12 Conference in the NCAA, which they joined in 1978. The Wildcats have won national titles in several sports, most notably men's basketball, baseball, and softball. The official colors of the university and its athletic teams are UA Red and Arizona Blue.

Square metre

The square metre (also spelled square meter, see spelling differences) is the SI derived unit of area, with symbol m²(33A1 in Unicode). It is defined as the area of a square whose sides measure exactly one metre. The square metre is derived from the SI base unit of the metre, which in turn is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in absolute vacuum during a time interval of of a second.
Adding SI prefixes creates multiples and submultiples; however, as the unit is squared, the order of magnitude difference between units doubles from their comparable linear units. For example, a kilometre is one thousand times the length of a metre, but a square kilometre is one million times the area of a square metre.
A square metre is not the same as a metre square, an area 2 metres wide by 5 metres long would be 10 square metres. In contrast, a 10-metre square (10 metres by 10 metres) is actually 100 square metres.
The square metre may be used with all SI prefixes used with the metre.
A square metre is equal to:

Eau de Cologne

Cologne or Eau de Cologne is a toiletry, a perfume in a style of that originated from Cologne, Germany. Nowadays, it's used as a term for scented formulations with a concentration of about 2-5% essential oils. Cologne may be used by men or women.
In a base of dilute ethanol (70-90%), Eau de Cologne contains a mixture of citrus oils including oils of lemon, orange, tangerine, bergamot, lime, grapefruit and neroli. It can also contain oils of lavender, rosemary, thyme, petitgrain (orange leaf), and jasmine.
"Eau de Cologne" is a spirit-citrus perfume launched in Cologne in 1709 by Giovanni Maria Farina (1685-1766), an Italian perfumer from Santa Maria Maggiore Valle Vigezzo, Italy. In 1708, Farina wrote to his brother Jean Baptiste: "I have found a fragrance that reminds me of an Italian spring morning, of mountain daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain" (Eckstein p.8). He named his fragrance "Eau de Cologne", in honour of his new hometown. 
The Original "Eau de Cologne" composed by Farina was used only as a perfume and delivered to "nearly all royal houses in Europe" (Farina Fragrance Museum information leaflet). His ability to produce a constantly homogenous fragrance consisting of dozens of monoessences was seen as a sensation at the time. When free trade was established in Cologne by the French in 1797, the success of "Eau de Cologne" prompted countless other businessmen to sell their own fragrances under the name of "Eau de Cologne" and even Farina. 
Giovanni Maria Farina's formula has been produced in Cologne since 1709 by Farina opposite the Jülichplatz and to this day remains a secret. His shop at Obenmarspforten opened in 1709 and is today the world's oldest fragrance factory. Other Colognes, such as the famous Cologne 4711, named after its location at "Glockengasse No. 4711", have the name in common but smell different. In 1806, Jean Marie Joseph Farina, a grand-grand-nephew of Giovanni Maria Farina (1685-1766), opened a perfumery business at Paris that developed into Roger & Gallet, that owns the rights to "Eau de Cologne extra vielle" in contrast to the Original "Eau de Cologne" from Cologne.
"Eau de Cologne", or just "cologne", has now become a generic term.

Total Request Live

Total Request Live (known from 1998 to 2008 as TRL) was a television series on MTV that featured popular music videos. In addition to music videos, the show also featured daily guests.
"TRL" played the top ten most requested music videos of the day, as requested by viewers who voted for their favorite video online. The countdown started with the tenth most requested video of the day and ended with the most requested video of the day. As of October 22, 2007, the countdown was based on votes, charts, ringtones, downloads, radio airplay, and streams, meaning that the video that the user requested might not have been the number one video of the day. The show mainly aired from Monday to Thursday for an hour, but the scheduling and length of the show has changed over the years. Even though the word "Live" is in the show's title, a lot of the show's episodes have actually been pre-recorded.
On September 15, 2008, it was announced that "TRL" would be over and it was later replaced by another show. A special, three-hour finale was aired on November 16, 2008 at 8 p.m.
Until 2010, a local version of "TRL" was still running in Italy on MTV.
The beginning of "TRL" traced back to 1997 when MTV started to produce "MTV Live" from the newly opened MTV Studios in Times Square in New York. "MTV Live" featured celebrity interviews, musical performances, and news updates. Music videos weren't a major part of the program. At one time, the show had more than 75,000 viewers.
At the same time, MTV aired a countdown show that was simply called "Total Request", hosted by Carson Daly. "Total Request" was a more quiet show, as music videos were introduced from a dimly lit set.
By the fall of 1998, MTV producers decided to merge "MTV Live" and "Total Request" into a new show called "Total Request Live". The new show made its premiere on September 14, 1998.
On September 15, 2008, it was announced that "TRL" would be shut down. The last regular weekday episode aired on November 13, 2008. The episode showed the process of the set being torn down.
A three-hour special that was aired on November 16, 2008 marked the end of the show. The final show included several musical performances.
On June 25, 2014, MTV announced that it will bring back "TRL" for one day on July 2, 2014 with American singer Ariana Grande.

Pareto efficiency

Multi-criteria optimization, or multiobjective optimization is a way of solving a mathematical or economic problem where many different parameters need to be changed to get one of the best possible solutions to the problem. The result of this is called Pareto efficiency, named after Vilfredo Pareto, who first used it in his studies. 
In economics, the idea of Pareto efficiency is very simple: If there is no way of improving the situation of one person, without making that of another person worse, the solution found is Pareto-efficient. 
If we look at what the economy produces, we might say it is on its Pareto Frontier or Production Possibility Frontier, meaning that it is making (or "producing") all it can with the things it has (such as machines, labour, land and ideas -- all called resources or factors of production). If this is the case, making more of one thing would mean making less of another; the resources are already being used to full capacity, so making more of one thing will take resources away from making another.
Just because something is Pareto efficient, it doesn't mean it is fair or "equitable". Even though no-one could be made better off without making someone else worse off, it is possible that one person owns all of the world's things. To make anyone else better off, some would have to be taken away from this person, making them worse off.

Nakahama Manjirō

, also known as John Manjiro or John Mung, was a Japanese sailor, educator, and interpreter.
Manjiro was born in the Naka-no-hama in Tosa Province (now Tosashimizu in Kōchi Prefecture). He was the second son of a poor fisherman. He worked when he was young because his father died and his mother and older brother were sick. Because of this, he did not learn how to read and write very well.
In 1841, when he was fourteen years old, the fishing boat he worked on ran into a storm and was turned over. He and the people with him were on the ocean for five days. They landed on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean where no people lived. They spent 143 days on that island. An American ship passed by the island and John Manjiro and the others were saved.
At this time, Japan was a closed country. The American ship or any non-Japanese ship could not enter Japan. Also, any Japanese who left Japan were killed by the Japanese government if they returned to Japan. Most of the people saved from the island were taken to Hawaii. The captain of the ship liked John Manjiro and took Manjiro with him. Manjiro saw a map of the world for the first time and saw how small Japan was in the world. Manjiro was named “John Mung” by the captain. He was adopted by the captain of the ship and lived with the captain’s family in the United States. 
Manjiro learned English, math, measurement, navigation, and shipbuilding at school. He spent all of his time to studying to be a captain. He learned new ideas from the Western world. For example, democracy and equality between men and women.
Manjiro returned to Hawaii and bought a boat. He and his friends from the fishing boat started to sail back to Japan in December of 1850. Japan was still a closed country. Because of this, he was investigated by the Shogunate (the rulers of Japan) for a long time. 
IN 1851, Manjiro return to his village in Japan. 
Around this time, Shimazu Nariakira, a historical person in Japan, was interested in English and shipbuilding. John Manjiro began working as an English teacher. He had a strong friendship with many statesmen. He was even asked to be a statesman himself. 
In 1853-1854, Manjiro was the interpreter for Matthew C. Perry when the Americans first came to Japan. 
In his later years, Manjiro visited American friends. By then, he could not speak English very well any more. He died in 1898 at the age of 71 years old.
John Manjiro was actually born as Nakahama Manjiro (Manjiro is a Japanese first name). The name "John" comes from the name of the ship he was saved by when on the island in 1841. The name of the ship was "John Howland." The captain gave Manjiro this name. In 1938, Ibuse Masuji, a Japanese writer, first used the name "John Manjiro." From this book came the name of "John Manjiro."
Manjiro had problems translating because he was not good at translating English sentences. This was because he had not learned basic grammar when he was young. He was used as interpreter when Commodore Perry came in 1863. Manjiro pronounced English just as he heard it. His pronunciation was different from present-day English. Japanese based their pronunciation of English at the time on Manjiro’s pronunciation. They were able to be understood by Americans and English people.
There is a musical about Manjiro in Japan. It is called "The Dream of John Manjiro". It was first done in June, 1974.
John Manjiro was the first Japanese man to set foot on the contintental United States, to take a train, to ride a steamship, and to wear a necktie. John Manjiro talked about world views with Ryoma Sakamoto, a famous Japanese statesman and general.

<doc id="170257" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170257" title="Proper motion">
Proper motion

Proper motion is the name for the way the stars seem to slowly move "relative to each other" when seen from Earth. 
The movement is caused by the fact that all stars (including the Sun) are moving through space at hundreds of kilometres per second. However, because they are so far away, it takes a long time for us to see that they have moved, and even then it takes a powerful telescope to see the difference. Because of this, for a long time, most people thought that the stars did not move at all. Even the ancient Greeks, who knew a lot about the stars and discovered some of the other ways they move, such as stellar precession, did not discover proper motion (although they probably suspected it). 
Proper motion was not proved to exist until 1718 when Edmond Halley noticed the stars Sirius, Arcturus and Aldebaran had moved from the places they were in star charts that Hipparchus had drawn around 130 BC. However, even after more than 1,800 years, they had moved less than half a degree.
Proper motion is useful to astronomers in figuring out how far away a star is from Earth because stars that are close usually have a larger proper motion (meaning they move faster across the sky) than stars that are farther away. For example, Barnard's star has the largest proper motion of any star, moving 10.3 arcseconds per year. This is equal to one quarter of a degree, or half the diameter of the Moon in the sky, in only 87 years. It is the second-closest star to the Earth at 5.98 light years away. Also, eight of the ten stars with the biggest proper motions are less than 15 light years away.

<doc id="170258" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170258" title="Origin of birds">
Origin of birds

The origin of birds is one of the most interesting questions in palaeontology and evolution. Birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs during the Mesozoic era. 
Thomas Henry Huxley ("Darwin's bulldog"), who was a comparative anatomist, made a study of this nearly 150 years ago. He compared the first fossil bird, "Archaeopteryx", with a small theropod dinosaur, "Compsognathus". They are two fossils from the same place and time: the Solnhofen limestone in Bavaria, Germany. The strata come from the end of the Jurassic period, about 144 million years ago. 
Huxley's papers on "Archaeopteryx", and the origin of birds, were of great interest then, and still are. He showed that the two fossils were almost identical, except for the front limbs and feathers of "Archaeopteryx". 
He united reptiles and birds under the title of Sauropsida, and thought that birds had evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs.
All palaeontologists since Huxley agreed that "Archaeopteryx" evolved from reptiles, but many thought it was derived from an earlier type than dinosaurs. It took a long time before they agreed with Huxley. Almost all now think that early members of a group of small carnivorous dinosaur were ancestral to birds. 
The group most favoured as ancestral is the Paraves or Eumaniraptora, which includes the dromaeosaurs and the troodonts. The dromaeosaurs include "Velociraptor" and "Deinonychus" but, of course, it would have been an earlier type of dromaeosaur, perhaps from the lower Jurassic. Dromaeosaurs have several traits we used to think were special to birds: hollow bones with holes for air-sacs, limbs with many bones either lost or fused, clavicles fused into wishbones, and feathers. 
The discovery of feathered dinosaurs and birds in the Lower Cretaceous of China was what finally convinced palaeontologists. What seems to have happened is this. Theropod dinosaurs evolved feathers for heat regulation rather than flight. From then, a small group began to use them for primitive flight. This group is represented in the Jurassic by "Archaeopteryx" and "Anchiornis".
Huxley had pointed out that "Archaeopteryx" was a mixture of reptile and bird features. Without the feathers and arms, its skeleton looked just like that of "Compsognathus". We now know its bone growth physiology was much slower than modern birds, and more like that of its dinosaur ancestors. This means it would take longer after hatching before it could fly. A modern precocial bird takes for 3–6 weeks from hatching to flying. In "Archaeopteryx" this milestone might have taken about 18 weeks. It might have taken two to three years to reach its final adult size. The evolution of the physiology of modern forms occurred later in the group's history. They have had over 140 million years to evolve after "Archaeopteryx". This is an example of mosaic evolution, where some characters in a transitional form are basal, while others are remarkably advanced.
"Anchiornis huxlei" is so far the only dinobird fossil known which lived before "Archaeopteryx". It was found in Liaoning, China. The strata dates to the mid-late Jurassic period, 160 to 155 million years ago. There are also feather-bearing non-flying dinosaurs from the Jurassic of China, such as the maniraptoran "Epidexipteryx". "Epidexipteryx" is the earliest known example of ornamental feathers in the fossil record, about 152 to 168 million years ago. 
"Anchiornis" had large wings, made up of flight feathers attached to the arm and hand (as in modern birds) as well as flight feathers on the hind legs, forming an arrangement of fore and hind wings. The forewing of "Anchiornis" was composed of 11 primary feathers and 10 secondary feathers. The primary feathers in "Anchiornis" indicated poorer aerodynamic ability compared to its later relatives. In "Microraptor" and "Archaeopteryx", the longest forewing feathers were closest to the tip of the wing, making the wings appear long, narrow, and pointed. However, in "Anchiornis", the longest wing feathers anchored near the wrist, making the wing broadest in the middle and tapering near the tip for a more rounded, less flight-adapted profile.
So the animal could glide, but probably not fly.
 
Flying gave the birds access to many new habitats, and an adaptive radiation took place. We see the results of this rapid evolution in the Chinese fossils from the Lower Cretaceous, which are more varied, and mostly more advanced, than "Archaeopteryx". There are now 31 different bird genera from the Lower Cretaceous of China. It is also clear, from the tail feathers of "Confuciusornis" (one of the Chinese fossils), that some of these birds were already using feathers for signalling and display, just as they do today. Like heat regulation, using feathers for display may be much earlier than flight. "Confuciusornis" is the fifth oldest bird fossil, about 25 million years after "Archaeopteryx". 
Most dinosaurs died out in the K/T extinction event, at the end of the Cretaceous. The only ones that survived were the birds. The birds, therefore, are not just the descendents of reptiles, but the descendents of theropod dinosaurs. Birds are the last surviving dinosaurs.
The pigments preserved in a 120 million year old fossil bird have been revealed using X-rays. A team scanned the beautifully preserved fossils of "Gansus yumenensis" and "Confuciusornis sanctus". Their study, published in the journal "Science", revealed the chemical fingerprint of pigments that once tinted the ancient bird's feathers. The trace metal copper is a marker for the dark pigment eumelanin. "The X-ray technique was so sensitive that it was able to show that each molecule of copper it detected was being tugged and squashed into a particular shape because it was bound within a eumelanin molecule".
Research of this kind has now been repeated several times.
This is an informal grouping of theropods closest related to birds. These groups are small dinosaurs. They definitely have pennaceous feathers (like birds), and therefore probably temperature regulation. One proposed classification is: 
The earliest example of a dinobird is a troodont, "Anchiornis huxlei", from the Upper Jurassic. This specimen pre-dates "Archaeopteryx" by 5–10 million years, and predates any other feathered dinosaur from its location (Liaoning Province, China) by 25–35 million years. This species had long feathers on its hind limbs as well as fore limbs, and could glide, but probably not fly. 
At least this clade of theropods had well-developed genuine feathers before the first known bird. Feathering in other groups of theropods is still uncertain. One compsognathid, "Sinosauropteryx", has plumaceous feathers, as does "Shuvuuia", another small theropod. Apparently, many small theropods carried feathers, whose function was thermoregulation (to keep warm).
There is now evidence that many early bird groups went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period (K/T extinction event). This is the same time that the other dinosaurs went extinct.
Researchers dated the fossils to within 300,000 years of the boundary layer at the end of the Cretaceous.
All living birds are Neornithes, a subclass in traditional taxonomy. The Ornithurae is the natural group made up of modern birds and their extinct relatives. Their relatives include "Ichthyornis" and "Hesperornis", and some of the Chinese Cretaceous birds. They all have a plough-shaped pygostyle, a bone at the end of the tail which allows the tail feathers to fan and retract. Other groups of birds became extinct in the K/T extinction event.
"Gansus" is a genus of aquatic birds that lived during the Lower Cretaceous, somewhere between 115 to 105 million years ago in what is now Gansu province, western China. It may be the oldest-known of the Ornithurae, depending how that group is defined. 
Under any definition, all living birds, including taxa as diverse as ostriches, hummingbirds and eagles, are descended from basal ornithurans, many of which were semi-aquatic. It is now thought possible that all modern birds descended specifically from a semi-aquatic bird similar to "Gansus". Thus, while "Gansus" is not necessarily a direct ancestor of today's birds, it is closely related to such an ancestral species.

Reddit

Reddit is a website where people share links to articles, media and other things on the web. The website is organized into "subreddits", communities within the Reddit community to discuss certain topics or analyze specific content. The submitted links can be voted on, and the links with most votes are displayed on the front page of the website. Reddit was founded in 2005 and is also available in other languages. People in the Reddit community call themselves "redditors". Some examples of subreddits are /r/Pics, /r/Aww, /r/FakeHistory, /r/WritingPrompts, /r/lounge, and /r/todayilearned.

Bryde's whale

Bryde's whale is a baleen whale. It is a small group of several species which look alike and used to be lumped together. The whale can grow from 12.5 m (41 ft) to 14 m (46 ft) long and a weight of 16–18.5 tonnes, with the female larger than the male. 
Until the 1950s it was considered a single species, Balaenoptera brydei. It is now known that there are several almost identical species. Balaenoptera edeni and Balaenoptera omurai are two other species in the group. 
There has also been confusion between the Sei whale, Balaenoptera borealis, and the Bryde's whale as they look alike and are the same size. Bryde's whale is unique in having three long ridges on its head that go from between the eyes towards the blowhole. All other rorquals have just one. The Bryde's whales skin varies from black to dark grey.
The whale was named after Johan Bryde, who built South Africa's first factory to process whales. They are found in tropical and sub-tropical waters. There seem to be several different types of Bryde's whales, but it has not yet been decided if they are different species, or a sub-species. In particular, "B. brydei" and "B. edeni" may be sister species.

Gut instinct. Looks suspiciously like a sock, creates RFA within half an hour of registering. Seems to have some of the same tone as Snow funn at tall. 
It is only a feeling. Both accounts have odd edits. Snow funn at tall created (a) copyvio(s) and mades different other odd edits 8 e.g. on RfA's). And of course, s/he is for me a voting account. Tardisrepect has voted too. S/he seems also to be a bit offensive. I belive that the creation of these odd RfA (for me) was the revenge for my notes on the RfA's and . It is just a feeling.

Nap (textile)

Nap is the raised (fuzzy) surface on cloth. Velvet in one of these clothes with nap. Nap can also mean a felt cloth.
In the 14th century, the word described the roughness of woven cloth before it was cut.
In the 15th century, the term nap refers to a pile given to the cloth. The word "pile" means the raised fibers that are there on purpose. They were put there, instead of vy producing the cloth. The nap is woven into the cloth, often by weaving loops into the fabric. The can then be cut or left on the cloth. Carpets, rugs, velvet, velour, and velveteen, are made by weaving a second yarn through woven cloth, making a nap or pile.

These two types of tournament are different. All golf tournaments meet are of the first type, but match play tournaments are in the second. Football (soccer) leagues like the Premier League are tournaments in the second sense, but not the first, having matches spread across many places over a period of up to a year.

Pandora's box

In Greek mythology, Pandora's box was a large jar (πιθος "pithos") carried by Pandora. It contained the evils to be let loose on mankind. When the box was empty, hope remained. The actual evils are not specified by Hesiod.
The word in the original text is "pithos", which usually refers to a large container; used to store wine or other things. Such containers were also used for funerals. In the case of Pandora, this jar may have been made of clay for use as storage as in the usual sense, or, instead, of bronze metal as an unbreakable prison.
The mistranslation of "pithos" as "box" is usually attributed to the 16th century humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam. Erasums is thought to have made the error when he translated Hesiod's tale of Pandora into Latin. Hesiod's "pithos" refers to a storage jar for oil or grain. Erasmus, however, translated "pithos" into the Latin word "pyxis", meaning "box". The phrase "Pandora's box" has endured ever since. This error was further backed by Dante Gabriel Rossetti's painting "Pandora".

Longshore drift

Longshore drift is the process of the ocean currents forcing sand and other material down a beach. 
The material is first pulled into the currents by the backwash (the water going out to sea) and is then pushed back up the beach by the swash (the water going onto the beach). Longshore drift always moves in the direction of the main wind. If longshore drift continues for a long time, beaches can be changed quite a bit. The changes depend on the details, and vary from place to place.
There are many inexpensive and effective ways of controlling longshore drift. The most common method is groynes (wooden walls that the sand builds up against). Some people dislike the groynes because they are not very nice to look at.
Longshore drift is the net (average) movement of sand grains across a beach in a zig-zag motion.

Gatorade

Gatorade is a brand of sports-themed food and beverage products, built around its signature product: a line of sports drinks. Gatorade is currently manufactured by PepsiCo, distributed in over 80 countries. The beverage was first developed in 1965 by researchers at the University of Florida, to replenish the combination of water, carbohydrates, and electrolytes that the school's student-athletes lost (in sweat) during rigorous athletic competitions. Its name was derived from the collective nickname of the university's athletic teams, "the Gators".
Originally produced and marketed by Stokely-Van Camp, the Gatorade brand was purchased by the Quaker Oats Company in 1983, who was bought out by PepsiCo in 2001. As of 2010, Gatorade is PepsiCo’s 4th-largest brand, on the basis of worldwide annual retail sales. It primarily competes with Coca-Cola's Powerade and Vitaminwater brands worldwide; plus, Lucozade Sport in the United Kingdom. Within the United States, Gatorade accounts for approximately 75 percent market share in the sports drink category.
There are many other flavours of Gatorade, including:
Gatorade is the official sports drink of NASCAR, the National Football League, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, Women's National Basketball Association, USA Basketball, National Hockey League, Association of Volleyball Professionals, US Soccer Federation, Major League Soccer, and other professional and collegiate athletic organizations, providing supplies of the drinks to sponsored teams in some cases. Distribution was extended to include the U.K. in 2008, coinciding with an agreement designating Gatorade as the official sports drink of the Chelsea F.C. Gatorade's 1991 "Be Like Mike" ads featured Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls, a North American basketball team which had just won its first National Basketball Association championship at the time. The ads began airing in August 1991 and the phrase "Be Like Mike" became household lingo in America. In more recent years, the Gatorade brand has continued to employ professional sports athletes in the promotion of its products. Primary endorsers in the 2000s have included Major League Baseball player Derek Jeter, National Hockey League player Sidney Crosby, National Basketball Association player Dwyane Wade, PGA Tour golfer Tiger Woods, and National Football League quarterback Peyton Manning. Gatorade is the official sports drink of 's home video affiliate, Viva Video, Inc.
Gatorade has been the subject of substantial media attention and reference in popular culture situations, most of which are in relation to team or individual athletic sports. The most notable and ongoing presence of Gatorade in popular culture is the Gatorade shower, originally called the "Gatorade Dunk," where players from a victorious team pick up the Gatorade cooler, sneak up behind the head coach, and pour the contents of the cooler (generally Gatorade and ice) over his head at the end of an American football game. This tradition was popularized in the mid-1980s when Harry Carson and Jim Burt, of the New York Giants, doused head coach Bill Parcells during the 1985 season. Burt's teammates picked up on this practice and popularized it during the team's championship season of 1986-87. The tradition has since become a recurring tradition across other team sports.
Gatorade has also achieved status as the cliché representative for sports drinks in American media, for example, in the film Clerks, the character Dante is at one point forced to give free Gatorade to his hockey teammates, and in the film "The Waterboy", Adam Sandler is told that "the water sucks" and that Gatorade is superior.

Wikipedia:Non-free content proposal

Wikipedia is founded on the principle that it be a free-content project so that legal issues regarding copyright are avoided or at least minimized. Most Wikipedia Foundation projects do not allow the upload of non-free use images or media. This is because not all legal jurisdictions around the World permit such usage. US copyright law does permit some cases of what is known as 'fair-use' usage of copyrighted material without obtaining prior permission of the copyright holder. As an encyclopedia, Simple English Wikipedia is tasked with providing a free knowledge resource for readers that is freely distributable and modifiable by editors and others regardless of media types used or media types the content is used in. Images often aid understanding of concepts. Some concepts are able to be explained without images at all, some need images but can be understood without needing non-free images and some can only be understood fully with the use of non-free images.
This proposal is to explore the need for usage of non-free images in articles.
The required to be met criteria for inclusion and upload of non-free use images is located at . It is more restrictive than US law allows, to keep us on the safe side of the law.
We use simpler English on the Simple English Wikipedia and images further that goal significantly. Many images that an editor needs to include within an article are available for them via Wikimedia Commons. Wikimedia Commons does not, however, allow the upload and usage of non-free content under fair-use provisions of copyright law. 
There are certain types of articles that tend to need access to non-free images. Some of these types of articles are; articles about television shows, articles about films and movies, articles about companies where the logo is a well-known part of their image (i.e.: Subway Ltd, McDonalds or Ford). Another common need would be software and operating systems. While many of these articles can be made understandable without non-free images, some can't. 
While some company logos are simple geometric designs and simple text and so are not copyrightable; many other logos are unique designs and are copyrighted.
What if an article is being written on the history of logos being used by a company. Without fair-use this would be impossible for many companies.
Screenshots of the show's titles are also needed for some shows. 
Software can be very problematic. Showing the desktop of Windows Vista is practically impossible due to copyright. You might be able to show Gnome running as a desktop, but showing the default desktop is an issue. 
The proposal is that only named editors with approval via a user-right or an editable list be given the ability to upload images. Furthermore this right can be removed for violations of the policy and the criteria for fair-use. Admins who upload and violate copyright repeatedly would be community censured and not be permitted to use their ability to upload images. This should serve to keep administration of images to a bare minimum. 
The proposal if accepted would be for a six-month trial period with a discussion and revote taking place at the end of said period. If it passes this it would become permanent. It would still be able to be revoked either by office action or by proposal for removal.

Roaring Twenties

The phrase Roaring Twenties describes the 1920s, a time in North America when art, society, and culture were rapidly changing. The term 'Roaring' applies here, as art, society and culture were rapidly improving and therefore 'Roaring'. Prohibition was in place and so North America was a very 'wise' and 'clean-cut' place to be. 
The North American economy during the 1920s was doing very well because World War I had just ended. Many new products were being made for the consumer. Products were being produced on a huge scale throughout North America, one example of these products is the 'Model T Ford', a car that was seen in every state of the USA.
The culture of the Roaring Twenties was very different from before. Women's roles were changed. Liberal young women, called flappers, wore short skirts, cut their hair short, and listened to a new form of music called jazz. Women had gotten the right to vote. Writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway were called the Lost Generation because they moved out of the United States after the war. African-American art and culture also grew a lot during the Harlem Renaissance.
Even though North America was doing very well in terms of prosperity, a lot of problems still arose. One of the main problems in North America during the 1920's was Organized Crime. Gangs of foreign immigrants were importing illegal alcohol, tobacco, firearms etc. One of the most famous gangsters of this time was Al Capone.

Topological space

A topological space is a space studied in topology, the mathematics of the structure of shapes. Roughly, it is a set of things (called points) along with a way to know which things are close together.
More precisely, a topological space has a certain kind of set, called "open sets". Open sets are important because they allow one to talk about points "near" another point, called a neighbourhood of the point. A neighbourhood of a point is simply an open set containing that point. If one did not have the concept of open sets, one cannot define neighbourhoods in a good way. If one tries to define a neighbourhood of a point as "any" set containing that point, it might just include that point and that point only, not any points near it, or points far away.
We also have the concept of "closed sets", which are complements of open sets. That is, all of the points not belonging to a certain open sets forms a closed set.
Open sets must follow certain rules so that they match our ideas of nearness. The union of any number of open sets must be open, and the union of a finite number of closed sets must be closed. (The second rule only works for a finite number of closed sets. That is because in many cases a set containing a single point is closed. Any set is made of points. If the second rule applied to an infinite number of closed sets, then "every" set would be closed.) As a special case, the set containing every point is both open and closed.
A set of points can have many different definitions of what an open set is. One can think of only certain sets as open, or more sets as open. One might even consider every set to be open. The same set with different definitions of open sets form different topological spaces.

A Fire extinguisher is a device which can be used to control a fire. Fire extinguishers can help remove the fire, and may stop it from burning. Depending on the size, some fire extinguishers can be carried around and operated by hand. There are different kinds of fire extinguishers. Different kinds of fire can be controlled by different substances. There are color codes, the color tells what kinds of fires the fire extinguisher is useful for:
There are also different sizes of fire extinguishers. Bigger fire extinguishers can be used for a longer time. Hand-held fire extinguishers vary between 0.5 and 14 kg. A 2 kg extinguisher works for about two to four seconds, the 12 kg model for about eighteen seconds. There are also bigger fire extinguishers, mounted on a cart or a vehicle. These are used to fight fires at airports, for example.
To be useful, fire extinguishers need to be checked at regular intervals. Usually, there are laws about this duration, concerning fire exinguishers in public buildings.

Minke whale

The Minke whale is the smallest of the baleen whales that lives in many places in the world. It is the smallest rorqual whale (the large baleen whales). A large one is about 30 feet long and weighs 10 tons. They are black or gray with white on their belly and a white "armband" across their flippers. It is the only baleen whale that is still hunted for money. The Minke whale can swim quite fast.
There are two types of Minke whale. They are:
The minke whales are the second smallest baleen whale. Only the pygmy right whale is smaller. Males measure an average of and females in length. Both sexes typically weigh 4 - 5 t (3.9–4.9 long tons; 4.4–5.5 short tons) as adults. The maximum weight may be as much as 14 t (14 long tons; 15 short tons). They become adults after 6 to 8 years.
The minke whale is a black/gray/purple color. Common minke whales (Northern Hemisphere variety) have a white band on each flipper. The body is usually black or dark-gray above and white underneath. Most of the back, including dorsal fin and blowholes, appears at once when the whale comes to the surface to breathe.
Minke whales usually live for 30–50 years. In some cases they may live for up to 60 years.
The gestation time for minke whales is 10 months. Calves measure at birth. The newborns nurse for five to possibly 10 months. Breeding is mostly done during the summer months. Calving is thought to happen every two years.

Gerrymandering

Gerrymandering is when a political group tries to change a voting district to create a result that helps them or hurts the group who is against them. It is named after Elbridge Gerry (1744-1814). Gerrymandering works by wasting votes. It puts more votes of winners into the district they will win so the losers win in another district. 
If we have Group A and Group B both trying to win in a district. Group A has 40 votes and Group B has 50. In another district Group A knows Group B will win for sure. Group A changes the voting district so that 11 votes are moved to the other district. Now they will win 40 votes to 39.

Suffrage is the right to vote. Most countries allow citizens to vote once they are legally an adult. In the past not all people were allowed to vote. In general, most countries today do not stop people of a different race or sex from voting. 
Suffrage can also apply to states themselves. Article V. of the U. S. Constitution does not allow any amendment to take away the States' equal suffrage in the Senate.
Suffrage can also mean the right to be a public official. Some people call the right to run for office candidate eligibility. Full suffrage means both the right to vote and the right to seek office.

<doc id="170677" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170677" title="Algorithm">
Algorithm

An algorithm is a fancy to-do list for a computer. Algorithms take in zero or more inputs and give back one or more outputs.
A recipe is a good example of an algorithm because it tells you what you need to do step by step. It takes inputs (ingredients) and produces an output (the completed dish).
The words 'algorithm' and 'algorism' come from the name of a Persian mathematician called Al-Khwārizmī (Persian: خوارزمی‎‎, c. 780–850).
Informally an algorithm can be called a "list of steps". This is nice, but it doesn't say much about algorithms.
Formally, an algorithm is a precise list of operations that can be done by a Turing machine.
Algorithms can be written in regular English, but it takes a long time to do so. Instead, algorithms are written in pseudocode, flow charts, or programming languages. Algorithms are usually meant to be run by a computer.
There is usually more than one way to solve a problem. There may be many different recipes to make a certain dish which looks different but ends up tasting the same when all is said and done. The same is true for algorithms. However, some of these ways will be better than others. If a recipe needs lots of complicated ingredients that you do not have, it is not as a good as a simple recipe.
When we look at algorithms as a way of solving problems, often we want to know how long it would take a computer to solve the problem using a particular algorithm. When we write algorithms, we like our algorithm to take the least amount of time so that we can solve our problem as quickly as possible.
In cooking, some recipes are more difficult to do than others, because they take more time to finish or have more things to keep track of.
It is the same for algorithms, and algorithms are better when they are easier for the computer to do. The thing that measures how
hard an algorithm is called "complexity". When we ask how complex an algorithm is, often we want to know how long it will take a computer to solve the problem we want it to solve.
This is an example of an algorithm for sorting cards with colors on them into piles of the same color:
These are examples of algorithms for sorting a stack of cards with many different numbers, so that the numbers are in order.
Players start with a stack of cards that have not been sorted.
This algorithm goes through the stack of cards, one card at a time. This card is compared to the next card in the stack. Please note that this position only changes in step 3. This algorithm is called bubble sort. It is slow.
Let us take a stack of the cards with the numbers "5 1 4 2 8", and sort it from smallest number to biggest one using this algorithm. In each step, the algorithm compares the elements written in bold. The top of the stack of cards is on the left-hand side.
First pass:
( 5 1 4 2 8 ) formula_1 ( 1 5 4 2 8 ) Here, the algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps them.
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) formula_1 ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) These elements are already in order, so the algorithm does not swap them.
Second pass:
Now, the stack of cards is already sorted, but our algorithm does not know this. The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.
Third pass:
Finally, the array is sorted, and the algorithm can stop.
This is an easy-to-understand algorithm for sorting. Computer scientists called it "Bubble sort", because smaller elements will rise to the top, changing their position in each run. Unfortunately, the algorithm is not very good, because it needs a long time (many passes through the stack of cards) to sort it.
This algorithm uses another idea. Sometimes solving a problem is difficult, but the problem can be changed so it is made of simpler problems that are easier to solve. This is called recursion. It is more difficult to understand than the first example, but it will give a better algorithm.
This works with two stacks of cards. One of them is called A, the other is called B. There is a third stack that is empty at the start, called C. At the end, it will contain the result.
John von Neumann developed this algorithm in 1945. He did not call it "Sorting by numbers", he called it "Mergesort". It is a very good algorithm for sorting, compared to others.
The first algorithm takes much longer to sort the cards than the second, but it can be improved (made better). Looking at bubble sort, it can be noticed that cards with high numbers move from the top of the stack quite quickly, but cards with low numbers at the bottom of the stack take a long time to "rise" (move to the top).
To improve the first algorithm here is the idea:
This algorithm was developed by C. A. R. Hoare in 1960. It is one of most widely used algorithms for sorting today. It is called "Quicksort".
If players have cards with colors and numbers on them, they can sort them by color and number if they do the "sorting by colors" algorithm, then do the "sorting by numbers" algorithm to each colored stack, then put the stacks together.
The sorting-by-numbers algorithms are more difficult to do than the sorting-by-colors algorithm, because they may have to do the steps again many times. One would say that sorting by numbers is more "complex".

John Caesar

John Caesar (1764 – 15 February 1796), known as Black Caesar, was the first Australian bushranger. He was also the first black person with an African background to come to Australia. He was the first bushranger to have a reward offered for his capture.
Caesar was most likely born in Madagascar, in about 1763. He was a slave in a ballet dancroom (farm) in the West Indies. He ran away and went to London. On 17 March 1786, he was in court at Deptford, Kent for stealing 240 shillings. He was sent to the new country called Australia as a convict for seven years. He left on the Alexander, a convict transport ship in the First Fleet, in May 1787 and arrived in Botany Bay in January 1788.
On 29 April 1789 he was caught stealing food. Two weeks later he escaped into the bush, taking food, an iron cooking pot, and a musket (gun) taken from a sea army officer (Marine) named Abraham Hand. He could not catch enough animals to eat, and he began to steal food from the settlement. On 26 May he stole food from a brick making gang at Brickfield Hill and was nearly caught. On June 6 he tried to steal food from Zachariah Clark, who was the assistant in charge of the new colony's food supplies. Caesar was caught by a convict named William Saltmarsh.
In July 1789, David Collins, the colony's Judge-Advocate, said that John Caesar was the hardest working convict in the new colony. He said that he was a large man with a lot of muscles, but he was always hungry. He would eat food meant to last two days in one meal, and would then need to steal more food from others. All his thefts were about getting more food.
After he was captured, Collins said Caesar was a "wretch" (a person) who did not care if he died. Caesar told Collins that he would make it if was hanged, he would turn into a joke by playing a trick on the executioner. Governor Arthur Phillip however, thought Caesar would be more use working and sent him to Garden Island, where he would work in with his legs tied with iron chain. He was well behaved and the chains were soon taken off.
Caesar soon escaped again; on 22 December used a canoe to get off the island, taking a week's worth of food. He stole a musket, and lived by taking food from gardens and taking the food of Aboriginals after scaring them away with his gun. After he lost the gun at Rose Hill, and was attacked by the Aborigines, leaving him wounded in several places. He gave himself up on the 31 December to an officer at Rose Hill.
On 6 March 1790, Caesar was sent to Norfolk Island. There he had one daughter, later named Mary Ann Fisher Power, to Ann (e) Power. He was taken back to Sydney in 1793, and began stealing from the farms and huts again. He was caught and then flogged (hit 500 times with a whip). This did not make any difference; Caesar said that "all that would not make him better."
In 1795 Black Caesar ran away for the last time, and formed a gang of runaways. On 29 January 1796, a reward of five gallons of rum was offered by Governor John Hunter for his capture. Every day there were reports of missing things, but he was able to avoid being captured until 15 February. A man named Wimbow, who had been searching for days, found him in an area of thick bush called Liberty Plains and shot him. He died soon after.

Musket

A musket is a muzzleloading, smoothbore firearm, which is meant to be fired from the shoulder. 
The musket is the weapon that replaced the arquebus, and was then replaced by the rifle. But the word "musket" is also used to describe a number of different weapons including:
Muskets were made for use by infantry. A soldier armed with a musket was called a musketman or musketeer. In the 1500's, soldiers armed with a heavy arquebus, called a musket, supported the arquebusiers and the pikemen. By the start of 1700's, a lighter type of musket took over from the arquebus. When the bayonet was added, there was no longer a need for pikemen, and almost all infantry soldiers became musketeers. The first musket made in the united States was the Springfield Model 1795 Musket. In the 1800's, better ammunition and ways of firing the gun, meant that rifling was practical for military use, and the rifled musket became common. A few years later, the use of cartridges, breechloading, and multiple rounds of ammunition meant the "rifled musket" gave way to the rifle, and "muskets" were no longer used.
Musket calibres ranged from to . A smoothbore musket, firing at a single target, was only accurate to about to . Rifled muskets in the 1850's were much better, able to hit a man sized target at up to . The advantage of this longer distance was shown at the Battle of Four Lakes, where Springfield Model 1855 rifled muskets killed Indian warriors before they could get close enough with their smoothbore muskets. However, in the Italian War of 1859, French forces were able to defeat the longer range of Austrian rifle muskets by quick, small attacks and bayonet attacks at close range.

<doc id="170684" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170684" title="ALPHA Collaboration">
ALPHA Collaboration

The ALPHA Collaboration is a group of physicists from about 11 universities who work together (or "collaborate") to try to trap neutral antimatter. The neutral antimatter they are working to trap is antihydrogen. This is the antimatter version of hydrogen, the first atom in the periodic table. Antihydrogen, like hydrogen, has two oppositely charged particles. Hydrogen has a proton and an electron, and so antihydrogen would have an antiproton and a positron. A positron is the common name for the antielectron.
The ALPHA collaboration has its experiment at CERN in Geneva in Switzerland. CERN is the only place in the world that can provide "slow" antiprotons that can be easily captured by ALPHA. ALPHA then brings these antiprotons into contact with positrons and form antihydrogen. 
Antihydrogen has, like many atoms and especially hydrogen, a small magnetic dipole moment. A dipole moment is another way of saying that the atom behaves a bit as if it was a tiny magnet with a north and a south pole. Normally such small magnets are attracted to other magnets. However, some atoms in some states behave such that they are repelled by magnetic fields. This means that the atoms could possibly be trapped in space by making a minimum of the magnetic field. ALPHA is trying to do just that with antihydrogen. By a clever arrangement of magnets, ALPHA has a so-called magnetic minimum trap, in which antihydrogen may be trapped. 
This is a difficult process. The magnetic forces on these atoms are quite weak, so the trap can only contain antihydrogen atoms of very low motional (kinetic) energy, that is at very low temperature. The current state-of-the-art ALPHA trap can contain antihydrogen atoms in their ground state if they are colder than about 0.5 Kelvin (i.e. 0.5 degrees above absolute zero). ALPHA is currently working on making such cold antihydrogen.

As of October 2009, about 1,991,055 square meters of rain forest have been saved.
For searching the web using Forestle is also essentially CO-neutral: Of course the server computers used by Forestle, the connection network, and the computer of the searching users need electric energy and thus create emissions of carbon-dioxide; but Forestle purchases an equivalent amount of renewable energy certificates. The certificates are purchased from a part of the 10% of money left after buying rain forest. This makes Forestle one of the few web search sites that are "green certified".
The number of search requests on Forestle.org grows significantly </ref name=proof/>: There were 4000 search requests per day on average in December 2008, about 10000 per day in January 2009 and currently, (March 6, 2009) there are more than 20000 requests per day.
Forestle thus offers a simple alternative form of searching the web in a way that helps the environment.
How large the effects of using such a 'green' search method actually are is discussed.
Forestle offers a website preview that shows small versions of the web sites found in each search. The search page offered by Forestle is very simple and only contains a window to type in words to be searched for, the search results, and a few links to check related services (for example Google Maps) as well as explanations about how Forestle works. Forestle meanwhile also provides several browser plugins, can be added to iGoogle and can be used in English and German (full versions) as well as in Spanish and Dutch (details partially in English).
Forestle used the search services of Google until Google forbid them to do that after four days of service; the reasons was that Google and Forestle had a fight: it was not clear whether Forestle broke the terms of service fixed in the contract between them. Forestle.org states that google did not actually give reasons for stopping their service. The action by google to not support Forestle any more immediately drew international attention. Details about the conflict between Google and Forestle are debated. Forestle is now associated with Yahoo.

Dextromethorphan

Dextromethorphan (DXM or DM) is a drug. It is used to prevent coughs in many over-the-counter cold and cough medicines. Dextromethorphan can also be used for pain relief or for psychological conditions. It is sold in syrup, tablet, and lozenge forms, manufactured under several different brand names and generic labels. In its pure form, dextromethorphan is a white powder.
If more is taken than directed, dextromethorphan acts as a dissociative hallucinogenic drug. Its mechanism of action (how it works) is as an NMDA receptor antagonist (blocks a chemical in the brain), producing effects similar to those of the controlled substances ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP).

Roman à clef

Roman à clef (said like it rhymes with "a don a day") means "novel with a key" in French. It is a phrase used for talking about literature and movies. A roman à clef is a type of story that's true for the most part except for details like the name of the main character. The "key" part of the meaning–what someone needs to unlock the real story–changes from book to book. For some books it is knowing that the main character is really a famous person. For others it is knowing that the main character is really the author.
Authors usually write these types of stories (instead of telling the whole truth) to talk about a controversy or what happened during a crime so that the people involved can't sue them. A couple of movies that are written like this are Citizen Kane (a movie about a man a lot like William Randolph Hearst) and Dreamgirls (a movie about a Motown group a lot like The Supremes).
Because it comes from French, the plural of roman à clef is "romans à clef".

<doc id="170812" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170812" title="Egbert of Wessex">
Egbert of Wessex

Egbert (also spelt Ecgberht) (–839) was King of Wessex from 802 until 839. In the 780s Egbert was forced into exile by Offa of Mercia and Beorhtric of Wessex, but on Beorhtric's death in 802 Egbert returned and took the throne. He was the father of Athelwulf of Wessex.
Egbert was the son of Ealhmund, King of Kent. He was descended from Ingeld, brother of Ine of Wessex. In 786 he made a bid for the throne of Wessex after the death of Cynewulf. Offa of Mercia however, made Beorhtric king instead. As a youth Egbert was seen as a problem for Beorhtric. He didn't want Egbert in England. While Beorhtric was negotiating to marry Offa's daughter he asked that Egbert be handed over to him. While Offa was considering doing just that, Egbert fled Mercia and at some point left England. He appears to have been welcomed at the court of Charlemagne for at least three years. This is at the time Frankish ports were closed to English ships and trading. Offa had offended Charlemagne by his son marry one of Charlemagne's daughters. While at the Frankish court Egbert married a noblewoman, Redburga. She was possibly a close relative of Charlemagne. Egbert and Redburga had a son born in Francia, Athelwulf, about 795. In 802 Beorhtric died. Egbert returned to become King of Wessex, probably with military aid from Charlemagne.
His first few years as king are not well recorded. It is very probable that he used this time to reorganize his army and his administration. Egbert formed an alliance with Wulfred, Archbishop of Canterbury. In 815 Egbert invaded Cornwall and brought it under his rule. He allowed sub-kings to rule it for him. In 825 the new king of Mercia, Beornwulf, invaded Wessex. Beornwulf had extended his authority over Kent, Essex and Middlesex. In what Frank Stenton called "one of the most decisive battles of Anglo-Saxon history" Egbert defeated Beornwulf. This was the end of the Mercian kings dominating England. Egbert sent his son Athelwulf with an army to overthrow Baldred, the Mercian sub-king. As a result, all of Kent, Surrey, Sussex and East Anglia submitted to Egbert. Beornwulf tried to recover East Anglia later the same year and was killed in the attempt. Kent, Surrey and Sussex remained a part of the kingdom of Wessex from this time on. Essex was later lost to the Danes. Egbert appointed his son Athelwulf as sub-king of Kent which included all the new territories of Wessex.
Egbert then defeated all of Mercia in 829. The king of Northumbria submitted to him after the defeat of Mercia. He assumed the title (King of Mercia). This title was also on coins made in the former Mercian port of London. In 830 Wiglaf returned to power in Mercia, but the gains of Kent and southwest England remained with Wessex. Egbert died 4 February 839. He left a territory larger than any other Wessex king since Ine. He was the "bretwalda" or overlord of Anglo-Saxon England until Wiglaf returned in 830. Even so, he remained the most powerful king during his time.
Together he and Redburga had:

Axilla

The axilla (also armpit, underarm, or oxter) is the area on the human body right under where the joint where the arm connects to the shoulder. The axilla is one of the four places where an medical thermometer can be used to measure human body temperature. The other places are the rectum, mouth, and ear canal.
In the area where the axllia is, the body parts that are found are the axillary vein, axillary artery, brachial plexus, lymph nodes and fat.
During puberty, hair will grow in the underarms. Many women choose to shave or remove this hair because it gives a neater and cleaner look when wearing some types of clothes, however some women do not shave and choose to have a natural look for cultural or symbolic reasons.
Body odor occurs in the axilla due to microorganisms.
Due to this, many companies make deodorants to help remove the bad odor.
Many people think of the axilla as being a ticklish spot.
In the U.K., the axilla is called the oxter.
Underarm, another word for axilla, only is the outside of the axilla.
Armpit, like underarm, refers to the axilla, but also means an object or place that is smelly or greasy.

<doc id="170866" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170866" title="Tetraphobia">
Tetraphobia

Tetraphobia is a fear of the number 4. It is a superstition found most often in East Asian areas like China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.
The Chinese word for "four" (, pinyin: sì, jyutping: sei), sounds very similar to the word for "death" (, pinyin: sǐ, jyutping: sei).
Chinese people take care not use the number 4 during important holidays, or if someone in the family is sick. Numbers such as 14, 24, and so on, are not used because they also have the number 4 in them. Buildings sometimes do not have floors with these numbers, apartments and hotels do not have rooms with number 4, 14, 24 and so on. Table number 4, 14, 24, may be often left out in wedding dinners or other social activities in these countries. Where there are a lot of apartment buildings, buildings that should be 4, 14, 24, are called 3A, 13A, 23A, and so on.
In Hong Kong, some apartments such as Vision City and The Arch do not have the floors from 40 to 49. Immediately above 39/F is 50/F, leading many who do not know about tetraphobia to think that some floors are missing.
The Chinese start numbering their military aircraft with the number 5, such as the fighter plane "Shenyang J-5". The Taiwanese and the South Korean navies do not use the number 4 when giving flag numbers to their ships.
In cities where East Asian and Western cultures come together, like Hong Kong and Singapore, it is possible in some buildings that both 13 and 14 are left out as floor numbers, along with all the other 4s.
In Korea, tetraphobia is not as important, but the floor number 4 is almost always left out in hospitals. In other buildings, the fourth floor is sometimes named "F" (Four) instead of "4" in elevators. Apartment numbers with a lot of the number 4 (such as 404) are hard to sell, and often they are not worth as much money.

Palace of Whitehall

The Palace of Whitehall was the main home of the English kings and queens in London, from 1530 until 1698, when all except Inigo Jones's 1622 Banqueting House was destroyed by fire. Before the fire, it was the largest palace in Europe, with over 1,500 rooms (at one time it was the largest building in the world).
The palace gives its name—Whitehall—to the road on which many of the buildings of the UK government now stand. The word "Whitehall" can also refer to the central government itself. 
It became an official royal palace in 1530 when Henry VII was the king of England. He also included a recreation centre with a bowling green, tennis courts, a pit for cock fighting (now the site of 70 Whitehall) and a tiltyard for jousting. It is estimated that over £30,000 (approaching £11 million in 2007 values) were spent during the 1540s, 50% more than the construction of the entire Bridewell Palace. Henry VIII married two of his wives at the palace—Anne Boleyn in 1533 and Jane Seymour in 1536. It was also at the palace that Henry died. It was a lesser used palace during the reign of the next few monarchs. 
The palace of Whitehall was destroyed by fire in 1698. Many of the palace's wooden structures were destroyed in the fire. Michelangelo's "Cupid" is to believed to have been destroyed in the blaze. After this the remaining structures were torn down. Now Whitehall has government buildings on it.

Direct memory access (usually shortened to DMA) is a technology used in Computers and microprocessors. With it, certain hardware components can use parts of the main memory for their applications, without the need to ask the CPU. The CPU will request data from memory once and the DMA will continue to fetch the data, freeing the CPU to do other work. This way, the CPU does not have to request every byte.

5145 Pholus

5145 Pholus is a Centaur (minor planetoid) of the solar system running in a stretched orbit, with a perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) less than Saturn's and aphelion (farthest approach from the Sun) farther than Neptune's. Close approaches of the object are not common: it has not come within one astronomical unit (about 150 million km) of a planet since 764 BC, and will not again until 5290. Astronomers think that Pholus started out as a Kuiper belt object.
It was found by David L. Rabinowitz, then of the University of Arizona's Spacewatch Project, and named after Pholus, the brother of the mythological Chiron, after which 2060 Chiron was named to follow the tradition of naming this class of outer planet crossing objects after Centaurs.
Pholus was the second Centaur type asteroid to be found and was quickly found to be very red in color. Because it's very red, it is sometimes called "Big Red". Astronomers think the color is because of organic compounds on its surface.
Unlike the first Centaur, 2060 Chiron, Pholus has shown no signs of cometary activity.
Astronomers think that Pholus' diameter is about 185±16 km.

Malcolm III of Scotland

Malcolm III of Scotland, aka Malcolm Canmore, King of Scots. He was the first of a of kings who ruled Scotland for over two centuries.
Malcolm was born in 1031, the son of king Duncan I of Scotland and his wife; a cousin of Siward, Earl of Northumberland. When his father was killed in 1040 Malcolm did not succeed to the throne. At the time the system alternated between different lines of the same royal family. So the king chosen from a different royal line was Macbeth, who had killed Duncan I in battle. Malcolm killed Macbeth in battle in 1057, but Lulach, MacBeth's stepson was selected as king. This broke the pattern of alternate selection. Lulach ruled only ruled a few months until he was killed. Malcolm finally succeeded Lulach and changed the succession to his own sons and their descendants. This made Scotland like other European countries in keeping the same dynasty on the throne.
Malcolm was in his late twenties when he finally became king. Malcolm would lead a total of five raids into England starting in 1061. The Norman Conquest of England caused many to leave England. Malcolm welcomed several into Scotland. These included Edgar Atheling, his sisters Margaret and Christina as well as their mother. Raised at the court of St. Stephen of Hungary she was beautiful, wise, and very religious. Malcolm was at once taken with her and asked her to marry him. She refused as she and her sister were destined to be . But after a time she finally accepted. By his marriage to Margaret he gained an interest in the English throne. 
Edgar Atheling joined the uprising in the North of England in 1069 but it failed and William the Conqueror sacked York as punishment. Malcolm joined in but too late as Edgar left England on a Danish ship. Malcolm had long claimed Cumbria and Northumberland and made another raid on Bamburgh. He took so many captives that it was said there was an English slave in every house in Scotland. In 1071 William came north with a large army. He came as far as Abernethy but Malcolm wanted peace. William agreed to give him twelve English manors and pay a yearly fee. Malcolm had to give his son Malcolm as a hostage but this made him a vassal of the English king. 
Edgar Atheling returned to Scotland the next year. He had been offered land on the border near Normandy by the French king. Malcolm told him to take it and settle down. He then gave Edgar gold and silver and sent him off to live in France. But Edgar soon returned having been shipwrecked on his journey. This time Malcolm advised him to make peace with king William of England. Edgar did and received a castle as a residence in England. In 1079 William and his son Robert were fighting in Normandy. Malcolm raided into England again being welcomed in Northumberland. But William sent his brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux north to punish Northumberland and Robert to raid into Scotland. Once more Robert and Malcolm settled their differences and were at peace again. In 1092, during the reign of William Rufus Malcolm raided England yet again. Peace was again renewed with William Rufus. But William failed in one of his promises to Malcolm, so in 1093 the Scots invaded England again. This time Malcolm III died while fighting at Alnwick Castle. His son Edward died there also. Margaret, his queen died of grief after hearing the news of the death of her husband and their son.
About 1059 he married Ingibjorg, the widow of Thorfinn Sigurdson, Earl of Orkney. She was the daughter of Earl Finn Arnason. Together they had:
He married secondly Margaret of Wessex . They had eight children; six sons and two daughters, including:

Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset

Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset (15 June 1519–23 July 1536) was the son of King Henry VIII of England and his mistress, Elizabeth Blount. Henry had an affair with Elizabeth Blount while he was married to Catherine of Aragon. He was the only illegitimate (a person whose parents are not married) child of Henry VIII that was confirmed by Henry VIII to be his own son. Henry had no other living sons during Fitzroy's lifetime and so Fitzroy was considered as a potential heir to the throne. 
He died in 1536 from a lung disease, probably Tuberculosis, one year before his half-brother Edward VI of England was born.

Steve Hart

Steve Hart (1860 – June 28, 1880) was an Australian bushranger and a member of the Kelly Gang. A close friend of Ned Kelly's brother, Dan Kelly, Hart was caught up in the murder of three policemen at Stringybark Creek. He was killed during the siege at Glenrowan, Victoria.
Hart was born at Three Mile Creek, near Wangaratta, Victoria, in 1859. His parents, Richard Hart and Bridget Young had come from Ireland. They had other children, Richard 'Dick' Hart (Jr.), Hugh Hart, Thomas Hart, Nicholas Hart, Esther 'Ettie' Hart, Jane Hart and Winifred Hart.
Hart was a small man, and a very good horse rider. His brother Nicholas was a jockey. One story says Steve worked as a jockey around Beechworth and Wangaratta, and won 'The Benalla Handicap' after a protest was upheld. He did not open farm gates, and always jumped them with his horse.
In 1877, Hart was sent to Beechworth Gaol for 12 months for stealing 13 horses. He met Dan Kelly while in prison. When he was let out of gaol he went to Bullock Creek to look for gold with Dan Kelly. He is reported to have said here's to "...a short life, and a merry one." He was at Bullock Creek while Dan and Ned Kelly were in hiding from the police. The gang, which on that day included Joe Byrne, heard gun shots and discovered a police search party camped nearby at Stringybark Creek. The next day the gang went to the camp to take the policemen's guns. Three policemen were killed and the gang were made outlaws, which meant that they could be captured dead or alive for a reward. At this time the police did not know Hart was a member of the gang. As a member of the Kelly Gang he often rode around in women's clothes to avoid being caught. During the search for the Kelly Gang, the police were told to stop women riders to see if they were really women. The stories of how Ned's sister, Kate Kelly, did things to help the gang, were probably really about Steve Hart.
Hart took part in the bank robberies at Euroa and Jerilderie. At Euroa he met an old school friend of his, Francis 'Fanny' Shaw (sometimes known as Maggie Shaw) and through her, the police found out his name. Hart also stole a watch from Robert Scott, the bank manager. When a bank worker, Bob Booth, asked him for something to remember the visit by, Hart gave him a lead bullet carved with the letter 'H'.
At Jerilderie in 1879, the Kelly gang held many people hostage in the Royal Hotel before robbing the bank. Hart stole a watch from Reverend Gribble, a parson at the Protestant church. Ned told Hart he was a common thief and made him give the watch back. After Jerilderie, Hart went into hiding with the gang for most of 1879, although Hart did go to a St.Kilda doctor to be treated for a foot problem.
In June 1880 Ned Kelly came up with a plan to get his mother released from prison. Dan Kelly and Joe Byrne went to Beechworth and killed their friend Aaron Sherritt who they thought was a police spy. They knew this would bring many police by train to Beechworth to capture them. In the meantime Hart and Ned Kelly had gone to Glenrowan and forced railway workers to pull up the train tracks. They hoped the police train would crash, and then wearing home made armour they would capture the surviving policemen. These would be held as hostages until Ellen Kelly was set free.
Hart and Kelly forced many people of the town into a small hotel owned by Ann Jones. They were joined by Dan Kelly and Byrne who had ridden quickly across country from Beechworth. They waited at the hotel for the police. The plan failed when news of the Sherritt murder took a long time to reach Melbourne. The people kept at the hotel were becoming difficult to keep under control. Ned Kelly let one man go free at 3.00am, the school teacher Thomas Curnow, who said he had to get home to his wife. Instead he went to the train line and was able to stop the police train safely. The police went to the hotel and began shooting. It is estimated that 15,000 bullets were fired. Joe Byrne was shot dead in the front room of the hotel. Ned Kelly left the hotel in the early morning, probably to meet with other men who were going to help him capture the train. He was captured by the police.
At 10.00am the police were forced to stop shooting to allow some of the hostages to escape. Several, including the hotel owner's son had been shot dead. Dan Kelly's sister, Maggie Skillion, and a Catholic priest Father Gibney tried to go to the hotel to tell Steve and Dan to give themselves up, but were stopped by the police. The police wanted a cannon to be sent from Nelbourne so they could blast the two men out. At 2.30pm the police set the hotel on fire, and Father Gibney rushed inside. Gibney saw the bodies of Hart and Dan Kelly lying side by side in a room at the back of the hotel, with their heads resting on blankets. They had removed the armour which was placed beside them. It is most likely they had killed themselves.
The bodies of Hart and Kelly were badly burned during the fire. People who saw the burned and blackened bodies were unable to tell which was Dan Kelly and which was Steve Hart. Hart's body, little more than a blackened stump, was taken by his brother, Dick Hart, and buried at Greta Cemetery the following day, 29 June 1880, in the same grave as Dan Kelly. He was 21 years old. After the grave was filled in, the whole area was ploughed over to keep the site of the grave hidden. The family was worried that the police would still try to get the bodies. Hart's armour is now on display at the Victoria Police Museum in Melbourne.
Over the years there have been claims that Hart and Dan Kelly did not die at the hotel, but escaped and went to live in Queensland. A man named Billy Meade, as he was dying in 1938, told a nurse he was really Hart. Another story says Hart and Dan Kelly went to South Africa. After serving in the Second Boer War; also called the South African War, they went to India, where Hart is said to have drowned himself in Calcutta in 1917. There is no evidence to prove these stories.

Australia national football team is the national football team of Australia. Its official nickname is "the Socceroos". The team is under the control of the Football Federation Australia (FFA), which is a member of the Asian Football Confederation. It has also been invited to join the ASEAN Football Federation. Australia's Youth teams play in the ASEAN Youth Tournaments. Australia has been the Oceania Football Confederation champion four times, and has been at three World Cup finals tournaments, in 1974, 2006 and 2010. FIFA Rankings show the Australian National Football team is one of the strongest countries in Asia, and is currently ranked 20th in the world by FIFA. Australia made it to the round of 16 in the 2006 World Cup held in Germany and were knocked out in controversial circumstances by eventual champions Italy. Australia's 2010 world cup finals campaign was also blighted by controversial and mostly incorrect refereeing decisions and lead to the teams eventual elimination in the group stages despite a 2-1 win over a higher ranked Serbian team and a draw against Ghana. Australia will now prepare for the Asian cup in early 2011 and the 2014 world cup qualification.

Psalm 151

Psalm 151 is a short psalm that is controversial because it is in some versions of the Bible but not others. In particular, it is in several very old Greek translations of the Bible but is not in the Hebrew Bible. There has been a lot of debate over whether or not the psalm should be considered part of the Bible.
The psalm has been known about for a long time and the Greek version was used for study for hundreds of years. When the Dead Sea Scrolls (which are in Hebrew) were found and translated, part of Psalm 151 was in them. This surprised the researchers very much, but not as much as what they would find later on.
After studying the scrolls, they noticed that the Greek translator had actually made a mistake. Two different pieces of two different psalms were treated like they were one big psalm when they were not. There is a big change in the Greek version after the fifth line (where the second psalm fragment would begin) and is a lot more like a story than most of the other psalms, which are more like poems.
The Greek version of the psalm says that it was written by King David after his battle with Goliath. It talks about how, even though David was the least of all his brothers, God chose him to be king. It then talks about how David cut off Goliath's head with Goliath's own sword after killing him with his slingshot.
The Eastern Orthodox Church accepts Psalm 151 as part of the Bible, but Roman Catholics, most Protestants, and most Jews do not. However, it can be found in some Catholic Bibles and in certain other Bible translations like the New Revised Standard Version.
