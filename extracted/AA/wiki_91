Patrouille de France

The (, "French Acrobatic Patrol"), but also known as the Patrouille de France or PAF, is the aerobatics demonstration team of the French Air Force. They fly Franco-German Alpha Jet's training airplanes. Its aircraft are painted in three colours: blue, white and red (like the Flag of France).
The "Patrouille de France" was created in 1947. The name made its first appearance in 1953 for an aerial show in French Algeria. At this time, the PAF flew American fighter jets F-84G. Later, the team flew the Mystère IV. In 1964, a lack of money in the Air Force budget caused the team to have to disband. But the Minister of Defence decided to bring the team back because he liked it. So the PAF was brough back in 1965, flying the French training aircraft Fouga CM-170 Magister. This aircraft was what the "Patrouille de France" flew until 1980. Since then, the PAF fly on an Alpha Jet.
"Patrouille de France" uses eight aircraft on display at the same time. A ninth reserve plan always stays on the tarmac. The call sign of pilots is "Athos" like the character of the famous book "The Three Musketeers". If all pilots have an important role, both are essential leader and his second, called "Charognard" (in English "scavenger") who present all the display.
A transport plane is always with the PAF for support. It is a twin-engine plane: Transall C.160 or Casa CN-235M.
"Patrouille de France" is common in the Bastille Day military parade over the Champs-Élysées, on the morning of July 14th. On this occasion, the aircraft unleash a plume of smoke lights. PAF often fly at the Paris Air Show on Le Bourget airport. Since it is seen as an ambassador of France, PAF is on display all over the world.

A* search algorithm

A* is a set of steps (an algorithm) that computers can use to figure out how to get somewhere fast between two places. If you have a list of locations, and how hard it is to get from one straight to the other, using A* can quickly tell you the fastest way. It's related to Dijkstra's algorithm, but makes smart guesses so that it doesn't spend as long trying slow ways. It's a good series of steps if you only want the path between two places. If you're going to ask for many paths from the same map, then there are faster ways, that find all the answers at once, like the Floyd–Warshall algorithm. A* will not work if you want to visit several places on one trip (the Travelling salesman problem).
A* first needs a list of all the places you can go to, and then it needs a list of how far the road is between each one. It will then tell you the fastest way to get from place A to place Z.
For an example, we'll say A is connected to places B and C, and B and C are both connected to D and E. D and E are both connected to Z. There are 4 possible ways to go from A to Z. You can go A-B-D-Z, A-C-D-Z, A-B-E-Z, or A-C-E-Z. A computer using A* first looks at how hard it is to get from A to B, and from A to C. This is the "cost" for those places. The cost of a place means how hard it is to get from A to that place. After writing down both costs, the computer looks at how hard it is to get from B to D, and adds this to B's cost. It writes this down as D's cost. Then the computer looks at how hard it is to get from C to D, and adds this to C's cost. This is a different cost for D, and if it's less than the one it already has, it will replace the old one. The computer only wants to know the best path, so it ignores the path with the higher cost. It will only remember one of A-B-D and A-C-D, whichever is faster.
The computer goes on and finds the fastest way to get to E. Finally, it goes from D to Z, and finds a cost, and from E to Z and finds a cost. It gets a final cost for Z, and this is the smallest cost it can get. Now the computer knows which way is the fastest, and it has the answer. The computer can do a similar series of steps, but with many many more places. Each time, it will look at the place that's nearest to A, and will add up the costs to that place's neighbors.
People call the above series of steps Djikstra's algorithm. Djikstra's algorithm can be slow, because it will look at many places that might be going the wrong way from Z. If you asked the computer how to get from one city to a near one, Djikstra's algorithm might end up looking in another state.
A* fixes this problem. A* lets you tell the computer a guess for how far it will be from each place to the end. The computer can use the guess to tell roughly how far it will take to get from a certain place to Z. Instead of just picking the place nearest to A to look at, it will look at the one which is probably going to have the lowest total. It finds this total by adding the cost to the expected distance left. This way, it can look only in the direction where things will probably get better. It's okay if the guess is not perfect, but even a simple bad guess can make the program go a lot faster. If you're trying to find a path between two places in the real world, a good guess is just the distance between them in a straight line. The real path over roads will be longer, but this lets the program guess it, and it won't go in the wrong direction.
In math or computer science literature, this guess is often a function of the place, and it is called a heuristic. Each place is a vertex, and each path between two places is an edge. These are words from graph theory.
A* is one algorithm in a big group of similar algorithms. These algorithms are all different ways of finding a path between two places, over certain paths between them. They are called path-finding algorithms. "Places" and "paths" aren't always real places, though. They can be abstract, and they can be a metaphor for something else. One example where it is a real place is trying to find a road trip on Google Maps or Mapquest. In this example, the paths are roads, and the places are houses or cities. A second example is sending information over the Internet. The information needs to go through many computers to get to the end. Many routers use A* to find the best way to send information across the Internet. Here, the paths are cables, and the places are computers. For a third example, where it's not literal, you want to make a certain chemical from the ingredients you have. Mixing some of these ingredients will produce new chemicals, and those can be mixed with each other. A path-finding algorithm could tell you which order to mix them in. Here, the paths are chemical reactions, the cost is how long the reaction takes to finish, and the places are the different chemicals you can make.

King Fahd International Airport

King Fahd International Airport () , also known by the acronym KFIA, is a Saudi international airport near Dammam. It is the largest airport in the world in terms of area.
The airport is an airline hub for the national carrier, Saudia. 
Design started in 1976. The site master plan was created by architecture company Yamasaki & Associates and Boeing Aerosystems International. This plan was completed in 1977. Construction began in 1983. The airport opened for commercial operations in November 1999.
The airport's basic infrastructure was complete by the end of 1990. The General Authority of Civil Aviation of Saudi Arabia finally opened the new Dammam King Fahd International Airport on November 28, 1999 to commercial traffic. All airlines transferred their operations from Dhahran International Airport, which had been in use until then.
KFIA is northwest of Dammam. The airport serves the entire Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia and the growing urban complex made up of Dammam, Dhahran, Al Khobar, Qatif, Ras Tanura and Jubail with total population of about 2 million.
The airport, in the Eastern Province of the country, is located between Qatif and Dammam, about away from Dammam. It is linked to population areas by two major roads. The northern exit links the airport with Qatif as a 4-lane highway. The southern exit links the Airport with Dammam as a 6-lane highway to King Fahd Road which is now considered as the main road to the airport. Abu Hadriyah Highway, serves as the airport's eastern border while Dammam-Riyadh Highway serves as a southern border.
On the airport's southern border, Saudi Aramco occupies an area of 250 km² (97 mi²) which is used for oil drilling and transportation facilities.
The terminal has six stories, three of which are allocated for passenger processing. The third level is for arrivals, the sixth level is for departures, and the fourth level is for boarding. There are two partial levels: the mezzanine service level and the mezzanine level (which is the uppermost level).
The passenger terminal’s total area is 327,000 m² (3,519,798 ft²). Approximately 247,500 m² (2,664,067 ft²) were built in the first phase, in addition to 11 fixed passenger boarding bridges serving 15 gates out of an original design capacity of 31 fixed boarding bridges.
The terminal has several customer counters of which 66 were allocated to Saudia (now shared with Nas Air), 44 to foreign airlines and the rest for Customs and Immigration.
The airport has several duty-free stores. In addition to the spaces allocated to duty-free stores, the airport has a separate area for shops specializing in the sale of gifts and all passenger related goods. This area includes restaurants, cafeterias, and banks, and is located on the arrivals level. Several ATMs and currency exchange shops are available in the departure and arrival areas. The airport is served by a multi-storey car park.
Smoking is not allowed in the airport. A fine of SR200 is collected breaking the rule. The airport has a smoking room in the Departure area.
The airport Mosque is built on the roof of the car park, in the middle of a landscaped area of 46,200 m² (497,292 ft²). The Mosque accommodates two thousand worshipers, access to it can be easily gained from the passenger terminal through two enclosed, air-conditioned bridges with moving belts, in addition to a third open bridge.
The Royal Terminal is reserved for the Saudi Royal Family, government , and official guests. The terminal was built on an area of 16,400 m² (176,528 ft²) and has four bridges connecting the terminal and aircraft. It is luxuriously furnished and decorated, and includes extensively landscaped exteriors and grounds. Despite its specialized purpose, the terminal is rarely used by the Royal Family, who generally prefer to utilize a similar special terminal at King Abdulaziz Air Base.
The airport has two parallel runways with a length of each, in addition to taxiways parallel to the runways and a cross taxiway to connect the two runways. A distance of separates the two runways to facilitate simultaneous takeoff and landing operations. For more convenience and shorter taxiing durations, the east runway is usually used by Saudi Aramco while commercial airlines use the west one, however situation changes if one of the runways is undergoing maintenance. Space has been set aside for the construction of a third parallel runway.
The airport is classified as Code E by ICAO which makes it designed to accommodate large aircraft lke Boeing 747-400 and A340-600. Although it may practically be possible for A380 to use the airport it is not recommended as in order to accommodate such aircraft as Airbus A380 or Boeing 747-8 it requires the airport to be Code F. Only the runways at Dammam Airport meet Code F requirements; the taxiways and gates do not. In May 2009, an Antonov 225 the world's largest aircraft landed at Dammam Airport from Ukraine whilst transporting equipment used for oil drilling and exploration to Tanzania for Schlumberger.
A road for ground support equipment (GSE) runs along the western side of the central terminal. It is designed to allow GSE to have access to aircraft and also to facilitate the movement of baggage vehicles from aircraft to baggage areas.
There are ten main Operations Services areas providing facilities for the operation of the airport.
The two-story air cargo building is constructed on an area of 39,500 m² (425,174 ft²) and has a capacity of 94,000 metric tons (103,617 tons) of incoming and outgoing cargo.
The terminal’s design allows for transforming the operation system to a fully automatic system with multi-level racks and a container stacking system. When the air cargo facility becomes fully automatic, its capacity will be increased to 176,000 metric tons (194,007 tons) per year.
The control tower stands 85.5 meters (281 feet) high, equivalent to the height of a 30-story building. The height allows visibility of all parts of the airport operations area. Its total floor area is 7,960 m² (85,681 ft²), and it contains the following three main sections:
The total area of the car park is 176,752 m² (1,902,543 ft²), distributed among three covered floors. The parking area accommodates 4,930 cars. Cars enter the car park through a roadway that leads to the second floor. There is direct access to the passenger terminal from the parking on the first floor which lies under the access road with exits leading to the main roads. Parking charges are 1 Saudi Riyal per hour, which is a flat rate regardless how long you stay. There are no special long term parking rates.
Two open parking areas are available beside the rental car parking area to accommodate additional cars.
Saudi Aramco is responsible for supplying fuel and maintaining fuel installations. These include six large tanks with a capacity of 40,000 barrels each, in addition to pumping equipment, filters, loading stations, and the distribution valve network. Saudi Aramco operates regular flights for its personnel, which originate from Dammam to cover Haradh, Tanajib, Shaybah, Hawtah, Al Ahsa, Khurais, Riyadh, Jeddah and Yanbu, using Boeing 737 and Dash-8 equipment.
The General Aviation terminal on the east side of Dammam airport is being used exclusively by Saudi Aramco. In addition, an advanced fleet of fuel tankers provides fuel services to all types of commercial aircraft.
This building is a 17,287 m² (186,075 ft²), single-story in-flight catering facility, capable of producing 8,000 aircraft meals a day plus 1,000 meals for staff and 300 for the Royal Pavilion kitchen.
King Fahd International Airport has its own plant nursery with a total area of which encompasses three green houses and of green fields. The nursery supplies the airport gardens and planted areas with trees and plants.
King Fahd International Airport consistently has over 2.5 million passengers per year and at present over 5 million passengers use the airport annually.

Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven)

The Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor ""Quasi una fantasia", Op. 27, No. 2, popularly known as the Moonlight Sonata", is a piano sonata by Ludwig van Beethoven. Completed in 1801 and dedicated in 1802 to his student, Countess Giulietta Guicciardi, it is one of Beethoven's most popular musical compositions for the piano.
The first edition of the score has "Sonata quasi una fantasia" written as the heading, a title this work shares with its companion piece, Op. 27, No. 1. Grove Music Online translates the Italian title as "sonata in the manner of a fantasy".
The name "Moonlight Sonata" started to become in use after the comments made by German music critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab about what the music reminded him of. In 1832, five years after Beethoven's death, Rellstab imagined the effect of the first movement like a moonlight shining above Lake Lucerne. Many agreed to this idea, and within ten years, the name "Moonlight Sonata" ("Mondscheinsonate" in German) was being used in German and English publications. Later in the 19th century, it could be said that the sonata was "universally known" by that name.
Many critics have disagreed to the subjective, Romantic nature of the title "Moonlight", which has often been called "a misleading approach to a movement with almost the character of a funeral march" and "absurd". Other critics have approved of the nickname, finding it memorable or similar to their own connections with the work. "Gramophone" founder Compton Mackenzie found the title "harmless", saying that "it is silly for austure critics to work themselves up into a state of almost hysterical rage with poor Rellstab", and adding, "what these austere critics fail to grasp is that unless the general public had responded to the suggestion of moonlight in this music Rellstab's remark would long ago have been forgotten."
Although there is no direct reason as to why Beethoven decided to title both the Op. 27 works as "Sonata quasi una fantasia", it may be important that the layout of the present work does not follow the traditional movement arrangement in the Classical period of fast-slow-[fast]-fast. Instead, the sonata has an end-weighted path, with the faster more technically complex music saved until the third movement. In his analysis, German critic Paul Bekker says that "The opening sonata-allegro movement gave the work a definite character from the beginning... which succeeding movements could supplement but not change. Beethoven rebelled against this determinative quality in the first movement. He wanted a prelude, an introduction, not a proposition.”
The sonata consists of three movements:

Denis Napthine

Denis Vincent Napthine (born 6 March 1952) is a Australian politician for the Liberal Party in the state of Victoria. He is a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, representing the electoral district of South-West Coast. Following the resignation of Ted Baillieu, he was elected leader of the Parliamentary Liberal Party on 6 March 2013 and was sworn in as the 47th Premier of Victoria later the same day. On 29 November 2014, at the Victorian state election, the Coalition was defeated by Labor and Napthine conceded defeat and his term as Premier ended on 4 December 2014 when the new Labor government was sworn in and he resigned as Liberal leader and was succeeded in the Liberal leadership by Matthew Guy.
One of Napthine's ancestors is the renowned convict, Joseph Potaski. Before entering political life he was a veterinarian, undertaking a Bachelor's and then a Master's Degree in Veterinary Science, both from the University of Melbourne, and later gaining a Master's Degree in Business Administration, from Deakin University.
Napthine was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1988 as Member for the country seat of Portland, as the electorate was then known. He was re-elected in 1992, 1996 and 1999. The electorate of Portland was abolished in the 2002 redivision. Napthine was then elected MLA for South-West Coast in the November 2002 election. He was re-elected in November 2006 with an increased margin.
He was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health in 1992 and then promoted to Minister for Youth and Community Services in 1996 in Jeff Kennett's Liberal government, a position he held from 1996 to 1999.
Following the defeat of the Liberal Party at the 1999 election, Kennett resigned as Liberal leader, and Napthine was a surprise choice to take his place. Napthine had briefly served as Deputy Liberal Leader having been elected to the position just shortly before Kennett stood down as Liberal Leader. During his term as Opposition Leader the Liberal-National coalition split, fracturing the opposition parties.
Under Napthine's leadership, the Liberal Party did poorly in the polls and did not make any significant electoral inroads on the ruling Labor Government. Shortly before the 2002 state election, Doyle challenged Napthine for the leadership of the Liberal Party. Doyle won the leadership by a narrow margin, but went on to lead the party to its worst electoral defeat ever, in which Napthine nearly lost his seat.
After the Liberals won the 2010 Victorian election, Napthine was made a member of Ted Baillieu's cabinet. He served as the Minister for Ports, Racing, Regional Cities and Major Projects.

Ta'if

Taif or Ta'if (, ) is a city in the Mecca Province of Saudi Arabia at a height of on the slopes of the Sarawat Mountains (Al-Sarawat Mountains). It has a population of 521,273 (2004 census). Each summer the Saudi Government moves from the heat of Riyadh to Ta'if. The city is the centre of an agricultural area known for its grapes, roses and honey.
The inhabitants of Ta'if, are largely made up of the Saudis. There are also significant foreigners from Asia, Turkey, and other Arab countries.
In the 6th century the city of Tā'if was ruled by the Banu Thaqif tribe.
The town is about southeast of Mecca. The walled city was a pagan religious centre. It housed the idol of the goddess al-lāt, who was then known as "the lady of Tā'if." Its climate was different from its dry and barren areas closer to the Red Sea. Wheat, vines, and fruit were grown around Tā'if. The city earned its title "the Garden of the Hejaz."
Both Ta'if and Mecca were resorts of pilgrimage. The people of Ta'if had close trade relations with the people of Mecca. The people of Ta'if carried on agriculture and fruit‑growing in addition to their trade activities.
During the Year of the Elephant, the city was involved in several events.
In 630, the Battle of Hunayn took place at Hunayn, close to this city. Shortly after that, the failed Siege of Ta'if took place. The city was attacked by Banu Daws, but it survived and repelled the attacks. The Battle of Tabouk in 631 left Tā'if completely saperated from the other ares so members of Thaqīf arrived in Mecca to negotiate the conversion of the city to Islam. The idol of al-lāt and other signs of the city's previously pagan past were destroyed.
On 17 July 1517 the Sharif of Mecca gave away Ta'if to the Ottoman Sultan Selim I. As a sign of this, he surrendered to him the keys of the Islamic cities of Mecca and Medina. As part of the Hejaz, Ta'if was also given over to Ottoman control.
The city remained Ottoman for a further three centuries, until in 1802 it was retaken by Saudi revolt, who were in alliance with the House of Saud. These forces then continued to take Mecca and Medina. The loss was keenly felt by the Ottoman Empire, which viewed itself as the protector of the Holy Cities. The Ottoman Sultan, Mahmud II, called upon his nominal Viceroy in Egypt Muhammad Ali, who launched an attack on the Hejaz and reconquered Ta'if in 1813.
In 1813, the Swiss traveller and orientalist Johann Ludwig Burckhardt visited Ta'if. He has left an eyewitness account on the city just after it was taken back by the Muhammad Ali, with whom he obtained several interviews while he was there. According to Burckhardt, the wall and ditch around the city had been built by Othman el Medhayfe. There were three gates and several towers on the city walls, which, however, were weak, being in some places only thick. The castle had been built by Sharif Ghalib. He also noted the destruction of the city caused by the conquest of 1802. Most of the buildings were still in ruin while he was there and the tomb of Abdullah ibn Abbas – cousin of Muhammad and ancestor of the Abbasid Caliphate – had been severely damaged. He also recorded that the population of the city was still mostly Thaqīf. In terms of trade, the city was an trading post for coffee.
The castle and military barracks in Ta'if were repaired by the Ottomans in 1843, a "Hükümet Konağı" – mansion for government business – was built in 1869, and a post office was established sometime later.
Prior to the Arab Revolt, Ahmed Bey had been made the commander of Ottoman forces in Tā'if. He had under him a force of 3,000 soldiers and 10 guns of the mountain artillery. Ghalib Pasha, the governor of the Hejaz was also present in the city. In 1916, the Hashemites launched their revolt against the Ottoman Empire in Mecca in June. The city had fallen and then in July, Abdullah, the eldest son of the Hashemite leader and Sharif of Mecca Husayn ibn Ali, was sent with seventy men to Tā'if. While his activities in the area aroused the suspicion of Ahmed Bey, Ghalib Pasha was unconcerned by a so small force. Abdullah secretly built up his army to 5,000 men. He then cut the telegraph wires to the city and then went on the attack. All Hashemite attacks on the city were repelled by the mountain guns, and both sides settled down to an uneasy siege. However, Hashemite guns were slowly brought up to Tā'if, and then the city held out a little longer; it finally surrendered on 22 September. The city thus later became a part of the self-proclaimed Hashemite Kingdom of Hejaz.
Ta'if did not remain in Hashemite hands for very long time. Tensions between the King of the Hejaz, Husayn ibn Ali, and Abdulaziz al-Saud, Sultan of Nejd, soon broke out into violence. Although hostilities were temporarily patched up in 1919, by September 1924 the then Saudi-sponsored Ikhwan under the leadership of Sultan bin Bajad and Khaled bin Luwai was ready to attack Ta'if. The city was supposed to have been defended by the king's son, Ali, but he fled in panic with his troops. 300 of them were slain by the Ikhwan. In 1926 Abdulaziz al-Saud was officially recognized as the new king of Hejaz. Ta'if remained a part of the Kingdom of Hejaz until Abdulaziz al-Saud unified his two kingdoms into one under the title of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. The king himself was later to die in the city on 9 November 1953.
Ta'if was still little more than a medieval city when the Saudis took control of it. However, they later stared to modernize the city. Saudi Arabia's first public power generator was set up in Ta'if in the late 1940s. In terms of building roads to the city, in 1965 the then King Faisal inaugurated the mountain highway between Mecca and Ta'if, and in 1974 the 400 mile Ta'if-Abha-Jizan highway was started.
Taif has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification "BWh"), with hot summers and mild winters. Temperatures are not as hot in summer as for lower-lying regions of Saudi Arabia. Rain is low, but all months see some rain, with more rain in spring and late autumn than in other months.
Bani Hareth is one of the Adnani Arabs tribes living around Taif in Saudi Arabia. The tribe is one of the biggest tribes in the area and occupies the full area between Taif and Al Qunfuthah in Saudi.
Bani Adwan is one of the Adnani Arabs tribes living originally in the northern part of Taif, and in the southern part of Jordan. (in Arabic) is a figure of the tribe In the pre-Islamic era, in which he's known as a poet and a man of wisdom.Furthermore, Banu Thabet are people descended from Thabit. The tribe is originally part of Otaibah clan.

Bipolar disorder in children

Bipolar disorder in children, more well known as pediatric bipolar disorder, is a very serious condition that affects children and adolescents. Identifying bipolar disorder for children and teenagers may be challenging-certain symptoms are very different from adults. Children and teens often have depressed moods mixed with mania taking place almost every day and sometimes at exactly the same time. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents is controversial, however. This condition often leads to impairments of daily function, and people with bipolar disorder which is prior to 18 years of age are far more likely to commit suicide. Pediatric bipolar disorder is far more acute in children and youth than in the adult population, with diagnoses at very early age. In children or teens, mania often has serious psychotic troubles with mixed mania and depression episodes which are worse and for more erratic times than in adults. Certain medications for this condition may have strong side effects for those under 18. Most bipolar children have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Violin Concerto (Beethoven)

The Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 61 is a work for solo violin and orchestra. It was written by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1806 for Franz Clement, first violinist and conductor of the Theatre an der Wien orchestra. It met with lukewarm approval. It did not receive its rightful due until 1844 when it was conducted in London by Mendelssohn.
The concerto opens with a few strokes on the timpani that led some music lovers to call the work the "Kettledrum Concerto". The first movement lasts about 25 minutes. The second movement is serene and free from the dramatic turbulence of the first. The third movement displays a happy liveliness and makes great demands upon the soloist's skills.

Pulse

A pulse (or heartbeat) is a throbbing of blood vessels as blood goes through them. You can feel someone's pulse in their wrist, thumb or neck, where vessels are closer to the skin. A normal pulse is below 100 beats per minute. Our pulse quickens when we exercise because the muscles being used need more oxygen.
A change in heart sounds might mean sickness. There are normally four heart sounds. Two of them, S1 and S2, can be heard with a stethoscope. Two other sounds, S3 and S4, can not be heard, but they can be seen using a machine called a phonocardiograph. There are many other heart sounds which are abnormal and can be heard or seen.

Fruits cannot be eaten because their seeds are poisonous; in some species, mainly those from New Zealand, the petals that protect the true fruits can be eaten. Several species of this genus can fix nitrogen from the air because they have bacteria of genus "Frankia" in their roots.
The name of the genus "Coriaria" was given by Linnaeus in 1753 in "Species Plantarum" (Vol. 2, page 1037). The type species is "Coriaria myrtifolia" L.
"Coriaria" comes from the Latin word "corium", meaning "leather" because these plants have a substance named tannin which is used to make leather from skins.
The several New Zealand species are known by the Māori name of "tutu".
The genus has a very interesting geographic distribution. It is found in 5 regions:
Some species of "Coriaria" are used to produce leather from skins of different animals (cattle, horses).
In New Zealand, the Maori people make a juice with the "fruits" (actually the petals) of "tutu". In Chile, the nuts are used to make poison for rats and mice.
Because they produce many bright, colored fruits, some species of "Coriaria" are used as ornamental plants.
In the genus "Coriaria" (y en la familia "Coriariaceae") there are about 17 species.

Spaceport

A spaceport is a place for spacecraft to launch or land. It may have launch pads for rocket-like spacecraft, and many buildings for preparing and launching space flights. In real life, there are very few space ports across the world. They are mostly owned by government agencies (like NASA), and used to launch scientific research missions and to launch man-made satellites. 
However, science fiction stories set in the future often have spaceports that are more like modern airports. In these stories, many spacecraft may come and go each day, and they may transport passengers like a real-life airline.

Pearl S. Buck

Pearl S. Buck (June 26, 1892March 6, 1973) was an American writer. She lived in China many years and wrote about the country. Her book "The Good Earth" was a bestseller in 1931 and 1932. The book won a Pulitzer Prize in 1932. She won the 1938 Nobel Prize in Literature for a trilogy of novels about a Chinese farm family and biographies about her missionary parents. When she returned to the United States, she became active in charitable and political causes.
Buck was born in Hillsboro, West Virginia. The S in her name, Pearl S. Buck, stands for Sydenstricker because her father was named Absalom Sydenstricker. He was a Christian Presbyterian missionary to China, so Buck went to China a little while after she was born. She lived in China until 1934.
Buck learned both Chinese and English. Her mother taught her English, and a tutor taught her Chinese. When she lived in China, the Boxer Rebellion changed her life and her family's life. Chinese friends stopped being their friends, and people from Europe and America came less to China to visit.
In the early 1900s, Buck went to America to attend college. She went to Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia. She finished college in 1914. She then became a Presbyterian missionary like her father and returned to China. She left the missionary life in 1933, after the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy, where Fundamentalists (people who thought the Christian Bible should be taught as it was and that ideas such as Darwinism were wrong) and Modernists (people who thought Darwinism was okay) in the Presbyterian church didn't like each other.
Buck went back to China in 1914. She married a missionary named John Lossing Buck in 1917. In 1920, they had a daughter. She was named Carol. Carol had Phenylketonuria, a disorder that can cause mental retardation.
Buck was not just a missionary in China. She did other work too. Buck and her family lived in Nanjing from 1920 to 1933. There is a college called Nanjing University in the city. That was where Buck's family lived. Pearl taught English Literature in two different colleges which would later become part of Nanjing University. Those colleges were the University of Nanjing and the National Central University. Buck's mother died in 1921 of a disease called sprue. Pearl went back to America in 1924 and got a Masters Degree from Cornell University in 1924. Pearl's family went back to China in 1925.
Something called the Nanjing Incident, where soldiers of two armies fighting for the control of China attacked Nanjing, happened in 1927. Pearl had to hide from the soldiers. Pearl nearly died. American Navy ships rescued her. Pearl's family moved back to China a year after the Nanjing Incident happened. Then she started to write. She wrote because she needed money to support her family. In 1929, Pearl and her family went back to America to get Carol medical care. In America, her first book was published. It was called . It was accepted for publication by a man named Richard Walsh, with whom Buck would later live after she left her husband. She went back to Nanjing later in 1929, and then she started to write The Good Earth. She finished the book in less than one year.
After the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy, Pearl quit her job as missionary and moved back to America for good. She left her husband and he stayed in China.
Buck divorced her husband in 1935. Richard Walsh helped her with the divorce, and she lived with him in Pennsylvania until he died in 1960. Buck died on March 6, 1973 of lung cancer in Danby, Vermont. She designed her tombstone. It had her birth name on it in Chinese.
Pearl wrote many books and short stories about her political views and what she saw in her life. She wrote about women's rights, immigration, adoption, war, missionary work, and Asian life.
Pearl did not like how adoption worked in America. The adoption companies in 1949 thought Asian children and children with mixed races were not able to be adopted. Pearl did not like that. Pearl created Welcome House, which was the first adoption company that had adoption internationally (between two different countries) and interracially (between races). However, some Asian kids were not able to be adopted. This led Pearl to create the Pearl S. Buck Foundation in 1964 to help those kids. It was later re-named Pearl S. Buck International. A year later she opened the Opportunity House (first called the Opportunity Center and Orphanage) in South Korea. Offices of the Opportunity House were later opened in Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. She made Opportunity house to help Asian kids who weren't able to live like other children.
Her books were reviewed a lot. She got many positive reviews. One person said she had "beautiful prose" (prose is how a person writes something) but also said her style makes reading her books hard sometime. Some people like how Pearl's books made Americans understand more how Chinese people lived. The books Pearl wrote made Americans like China more and also made Americans like Japan less.
In 1983 (ten years after Pearl died), the United States Postal Service made a postage stamp with Pearl on it. It was part of the 5 cent Great Americans Series. In 1999, the National Women's History Project made Pearl an Honoree of the Women's History Month.
"The Good Earth" was Buck's most popular book. It was a bestseller in 1931 and 1932. In 1932, Buck won the Pulitzer Prize for "The Good Earth". She wrote many other books and short stories. She wrote biographies (a biography is a story about the life of someone) about her parents. In 1938, she won the Nobel Prize in Literature for her biographies and her trilogy.

Cyanosis

Cyanosis is a medical problem. When a person has cyanosis, their skin and mucous membranes turn blue or purple. Cyanosis is a sign that the cyanotic (blue) parts of the body are not getting enough blood and oxygen. This can happen because there is not enough oxygen in the blood. It can also happen when small blood vessels in the body get smaller because of a medical problem (this is called vasoconstriction).
Usually cyanosis is first seen in the extremities (the parts of the body that are farthest away from the heart). Usually the first parts of the body to become cyanotic are the fingertips (especially under the fingernails), the toes, the lips, the tip of the nose, and the earlobes. As the body goes longer without oxygen, more of the body becomes cyanotic.

Physical system

In physics, a physical system is any object or part of an object that can be analysed with the laws of physics. An atom or the water in a lake can both be considered as physical systems. Everything outside the system is called the environment, which in the analysis is ignored except for its effects on the system.
All matter and energy in the universe could be treated as one big physical system, but often it is much much easier to look at the universe a few particles at a time, and treat these particles as their own quantum systems. There are many many different physical systems that physicists like to study. Some examples are:
Physical systems are different to conceptual systems, which study theoretical objects, ideas or concepts (such as the Turing machine).

Parcae

In Roman mythology, the Parcae (singular, Parca) were the female personifications of destiny. They are often called the Fates in English. Their Greek equivalent were the Moirai. They controlled the "thread of life" of every mortal and immortal. Even the gods feared the Parcae. 
The names of the three Parcae were:
The earliest known documents about these deities are three small stelae "(cippi)". They were found near ancient Lavinium shortly after World War II. They have the inscription:
"Neuna fata, Neuna dono, Parca Maurtia dono"
The names of two of the three Roman Parcae are recorded ("Neuna" = Nona, "Maurtia" = Morta) and connected to the concept of "fata".
One of the sources for the Parcae is "Metamorphoses" by Ovid, II 654, V 532, VIII 452, XV 781.

In 1827, Henry Dodge began what would become the city of Dodgeville. Dodge made a pact with the local Winnebago Indian leaders. The pact let him build a cabin and smelter. The first community was made up of three settlements: "Dodgeville", "Dirty Hollow" and "Minersville".
Dodgeville was named after Henry Dodge. It grew slowly during its early years. It became a village in the 1840s. Later a small "war" was fought with Mineral Point over which community should be the county seat of Iowa County. Mineral Point was the seat, but the people of Dodgeville felt they should be the county seat. It is said that people from Mineral Point fired a cannon at Dodgeville over this. Dodgeville eventually became the county seat. It is the site of the Iowa County seat in what is Wisconsin's oldest courthouse. Dodgeville then had its population grow very quickly. Many miners moved to the city from England. British and Cornish architecture can still be seen in the city today. Dodgeville became the largest city in Wisconsin. This did not last long. The amount of mining grew smaller. Because of this, quickly growing cities such as Milwaukee became larger than Dodgeville.
The foundations for the Iowa County Courthouse were laid in 1859. This makes it the oldest continuously active courthouse in the state.

Violin Concerto No. 1 (Bach)

The Violin Concerto No. 1 in A minor, BWV 1042 is a work for solo violin and orchestra. It was written by Johann Sebastian Bach about 1730. It consists of three movements (quick-slow-quick) in imitation of the pattern set by Antonio Vivaldi. The first movement is in quick 2/4 time and written in ritornello structure. The central movement is an aria "without wordslyrical, expressively warm, ever gentle, yet inescapably melancholic..." The last movement is a jig in 3/8 time marked Allegro. Like Bach's two other violin concertos, the solo instrument appears to both compete and cooperate with the orchestra.

The Violin Concerto No. 5 in A major ("Turkish"), K. 219 is a work for solo violin and orchestra. It was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1775. He wrote five concertos for violin between April and December 1775. These were probably written for his own use as concertmaster of the Archbishop of Salzburg's orchestra. The five concertos are the only violin concertos he wrote.
The concerto begins with a quick Allegro aperto movement which is followed by a slow Adagio second movement. The third and final movement is a rondo in minuet tempo. "Turkish" music was popular at the time this concerto was written. The rondo's wild, frenzied contrasting section gives the concerto its nickname.

Family Fortunes

Family Fortunes is a British television game show. It is based on the American game show "Family Feud". It has aired in various forms since 1980. The current version is called All Star Family Fortunes and is hosted by Vernon Kay. It airs Saturday nights on ITV.
Two teams of five family members compete to guess the answers to survey questions asked to 100 people. The answers are seen on a huge survey board, named Mr. Babbage after Charles Babbage, who came up with the idea of a computer that could be programmed. Each answer is worth £1 per point. If a given answer does not make the survey, the family gets a strike. This is indicated by an "Eh-uh" sound effect, which has become a popular element of the show. If a family gets three strikes, the other family can steal the points by giving an answer that makes the survey. After three rounds, Double Money is played. Here, answers are worth £2 a point, and there are usually fewer answers. The first team to reach 300 points goes on to play Big Money.
Two members of the winning family are asked five survey questions, one at a time. One family member is on-stage, while the other is off-stage. After the five questions are answered or the time limit (either 15 or 20 seconds) is up, the answers and their point values are revealed. After that, the other family member is asked the same five questions. They must give different answers. Afterwards, the answers and their point values are revealed. If the family gets 200 points or more, they win the top prize. If the family gives the number one answers for all five questions, they also win a bonus prize. If they do not reach 200 points, they win £2 per point (£10 per point in the current version).
"Family Fortunes" originally aired from 1980 to 2002 on ITV. It was hosted by Bob Monkhouse from 1980 to 1983. In 1983, Max Bygraves replaced him. Bygraves hosted from 1983 to 1985. When the show came back in 1987, it was hosted by Les Dennis. Dennis hosted from 1987 to 2002. In 2002, he was replaced by Andy Collins, who hosted until the show's end that same year. The current version, which started in 2006, is hosted by Vernon Kay.

Stall (flight)

A stall is what happens when an aerofoil can not make enough lift to keep the aircraft in level flight. Stalling is risky and can be dangerous during low-level flying.
The stall is most likely to happen because of low air speed. To compensate for a decrease in air speed, for example, a pilot may raise the nose of the aircraft subsequently increasing angle of attack, which may increase Lift Coefficient and keep the same lift. However, after a critical angle of attack is passed (often around 16 degrees) the lift stops increasing and actually collapses, causing a stall. 
The critical angle of attack will always stall the aircraft. It does not matter whether the aircraft is going fast or slowly.
The signs of the developing stall are:
The signs of a full stall are:
There is the chance of entering a spin if the aircraft controls are not coordinated.
To recover from a stall, the pilot must push the nose down. Then he must increase the engine power using the throttle. When air speed increases again, the pilot can level his wings and pull up to return to his assigned flight level.
An aircraft with a T tail is at risk from deep stall, because the turbulent air coming back off the stalled wings covers the elevators and makes it very difficult to push the nose down and recover.
A stall turn is an aerobatic manoeuvre also known as a hammerhead. The pilot lowers the aircraft's nose to increase speed, then pulls up sharply to the vertical. The aircraft slows to a low airspeed, then the pilot applies rudder to yaw to the left or right through 180 degrees. The pilot then recovers from the subsequent dive once the aircraft has sufficient airspeed. If executed correctly the wing is not stalled at any point, hence the preferred name of "hammerhead" for this manoeuvre.

The shortfin mako has a wide distribution, being found in tropical and temperate waters throughout the world's oceans. It is a true pelagic species, but it inhabits the cooler, deeper water of tropical regions. The shortfin mako shark has been recorded at depths of up to 740 metres. 
The shortfin mako is the fastest species of shark known, reaching speeds of up to 32 km/h (20 mph), and with bursts of up to . Its great speed helps it to capture other fast swimming animals on which it preys. The shortfin mako shark feeds on pelagic fish such as swordfish, tunas, and other sharks, as well as squid. The shortfin mako holds the record for the longest distance travel: about in 37 days. This is an average of about per day. 
Shortfin mako often leap in sets of three. The third leap is usually the highest. It can reach as high as above the surface. This high-leaping fish is a highly sought-after game fish worldwide. There are cases when an angry shortfin jumped into a boat after it was hooked.
The longfin mako shark has longer pectoral fins and larger eyes than the shortfin shark. It is longer than the shortfin, reaching a maximum length of 4.2 metres. However, it weighs less than the shortfin, weighing up to only 70 kg (154 pounds).
The longfin mako is a pelagic species, and is found in the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Ocean. It is common in the western Atlantic and central Pacific, but elsewhere it is rare. It is thought to be a bottom-dwelling shark, living in tropical and warm temperate waters, but this is uncertain.
Not a lot is known about the Longfin mako shark's feeding habits, but it is thought to feed on schooling fish and pelagic cephalopods.

Pilbara

The Pilbara is a large, thinly populated region in the north of Western Australia. The region has (2010) a population of about 48,600.
Pilbara is known for Aboriginal peoples, its stunning landscapes, its red earth and its vast mineral deposits, in particular iron ore. It is a dry region, but it has cyclones every year or two. The cyclones bring a great deal of rain when they do occur.
The area is known for its petroleum, natural gas and iron ore deposits, which make up much of the economy of Western Australia. Other than mining, pastoral activities as well as fishing and tourism are the main industries.
The Pilbara covers an area of 502,000 km². It includes some of Earth's oldest rock formations in the Pilbara craton. This is one of the world's oldest undisturbed rock formations, dating back to the Archaean eon. It includes landscapes of coastal plains and mountain ranges with cliffs and gorges.

2000 UEFA Cup semi-final violence

The 2000 UEFA Cup semi-final violence was a number of fights in Istanbul, Turkey between fans of English football team Leeds United and Turkish team, Galatasaray before their UEFA Cup semi-final first leg. It is noted for the deaths of two Leeds fans. 
The events happened at 21:00 in Istanbul's Taksim Square during a fight between Leeds fans and Galatasaray fans the day before their UEFA Cup semi-final first leg at Galatasaray's Ali Sami Yen Stadium in Istanbul on 6 April 2000.
Leeds fans had been reportedly taunting people from local bars, to which the Turkish police were called in to stop fights breaking out. There were reports that a Galatasaray fan had run to a nearby phone box to call for help when he saw Leeds fans coming into the area. A large number of Galatasaray fans, reportedly part of a gang called "The Night Watchmen", entered the area soon after which led to a fight between the two sets of fans which led to the two Leeds fans being stabbed. Police arrested Ali Umit Demir and three other men for the stabbings. 
It was not clear how the fight started with reports of the fight either being started by Leeds fans throwing beer glasses at Galatasaray fans and being rude about the Turkish flag or being started by Galatasaray fans throwing chairs or attacking Leeds fans with knives.

The names ariary and iraimbilanja come from earlier currency. Ariary was the name for a silver dollar. Iraimbilanja means "one iron weight". It was the name of an old coin worth ⅕ of an ariary.
The ariary was first used in 1961. It was equal to 5 Malagasy francs. Coins and banknotes were printed in both francs and ariary. The sub-unit of the ariary, the "iraimbilanja", was worth ⅕ of an ariary. Because of this, it was equal to one franc. The ariary replaced the franc as the official currency of Madagascar on January 1, 2005.

The Chase

The Chase is a British television game show that airs on ITV. It started on 29 June 2009. It is presented by Bradley Walsh. So far, it has run for six series.
Four players work together as a team. At the start, each player takes a turn in answering as many questions as they can in 60 seconds. Each correct answer is worth £1,000. This money goes into the player's bank. After all four players have their turn, they then take turns going against the "Chaser."
At the start, the player's money goes on a sloped board. The board has seven spaces. The player starts three spaces ahead of the Chaser. The Chaser then offers two amounts: one higher than their bank, and one lower than their bank. For example, if the player won £6,000, the Chaser might offer £12,000 as the high amount and £3,000 as the low amount. If the player takes the high amount, their head start is lowered to two spaces. If they take the low amount, their head start is increased to four spaces.
After the player decides on what to do, the player and the Chaser are both asked the same multiple-choice question. They both lock in their answers at the same time. If one answers and the other does not do so at the same time, a five-second time limit is given for the one that did not answer. If the player answers correctly, they move one space closer to the bottom of the board. If the Chaser answers correctly, they move one space closer to "catching" the player. If an incorrect answer is given by either, they stay where they are on the board.
If the player reaches the end of the board, their amount is added to the team bank. However, if the Chaser catches the player, the player is out of the game, and their bank is lost. This is done three more times with the other three players. The players still in the game move to on the Final Chase. If all four players are caught, their bank is set to £4,000, and they must choose one player to play the Final Chase.
The player(s) still in the game face the Chaser to win their prize money. They start with a one-step head start for each player in the Final Chase. They then have two minutes to answer as many questions as they can. Each correct answer gives them another step. After their time ends, the Chaser is given two minutes to catch the player(s). If the Chaser does not catch them, the player(s) win their prize money. If the Chaser does catch them, the player(s) leave with nothing.

He worked to destroy the Confederacy, free all the slaves and keep on good terms with Europe. During Reconstruction, he fought to minimize the power of the ex-Confederates and guarantee equal rights to the Freedmen.
Sumner made a speech to put an end to slavery and attack the Kansas-Nebraska act. Sumner attacked many senators about the war and slavery including Senator Stephen A. Douglas and South Carolina's Andrew Butler. This made the Representative from South Carolina, Preston Brooks (Andrew Butler's nephew), angry because he attacked his uncle. Brooks grabbed his cane and knocked Sumner onto the Senate floor. Sumner had to stop his political career until he recovered two years later.
Sumner was born on January 6, 1811 in Boston, Massachusetts. He studied at Boston Latin School and at Harvard College. Sumner was married to Alice Hopper from 1866 until they divorced in 1873. They had no children. Sumner died on March 11, 1874 in Washington, D.C. from an heart attack, aged 63.

Coefficient of friction

A coefficient of friction is a value that shows the relationship between the force of friction between two objects and the normal reaction between the objects. It is a value that is sometimes used in physics to find an object's normal force or frictional force when other methods aren't available.
The coefficient of friction is shown by formula_1. In that equation, formula_2 is the frictional force, formula_3 is the coefficient of friction, and formula_4 is the normal force.
The coefficient formula_5 can be two different things. It is either the coefficient of static friction formula_6, or the coefficient of kinetic friction formula_7.The coefficient of static friction is the friction force between two objects when neither of the objects is moving. The coefficient of kinetic friction is the force between two objects when one object is moving, or if two objects are moving against each other.
The coefficient of friction is dimensionless, meaning it does not have any units. It is a scalar, meaning the direction of the force does not affect the physical quantity.
The coefficient of friction depends on the objects that are causing friction. The value is usually between 0 and 1 but can be greater than 1. A value of 0 means there is no friction at all between the objects. This is only theoretically possible. All objects in the real world will have some friction when they touch each other. A value of 1 means the frictional force is equal to the normal force. Some people think that the coefficient of friction can never be more than 1, but this is not true. A coefficient of friction that is more than one just means that friction is stronger than the normal force. An object such as silicone rubber, for example, can have a coefficient of friction much greater than one. The coefficient of friction can also be changed by the mass and speed of the moving object. 
The friction force is the force exerted by a surface when an object moves across it - or makes an effort to move across it.
The frictional force or force of friction can be expressed as
formula_8 (1)
where
formula_2 is the frictional force (in Newton),
formula_5 is the static (formula_6) or kinetic (formula_7) frictional coefficient (dimensionless) and
formula_13 is the normal force (in Newton).

Invader Zim

Invader Zim, branded as Invader ZIM, is an American cartoon series that was created by comic artist Jhonen Vasquez for Nickelodeon. The series started on March 30, 2001 and was cancelled on December 10, 2002. The show centers around Zim (voice by Richard Horviz), an extraterrestrial being from the planet Irk, who inhabitants participate in an event called "Impending Doom". After failing it miserably, Zim is determined to prove himself to his leaders, the almighty tallest and conquer earth. However, the tallest only sent him to his planet as a "secret mission" only to get rid of him. The series had cost too much to air and the age demographic was aimed toward preteens, but not many were watching the show. Nickelodeon then cancelled the show on January 17, 2002, allowing the remainder of Season 1 to air and "The Most Horrible X-mas Ever" at the series finale.

They then rekindled the event and entitled it as Operation Impending Doom II. They sent Zim six months from Irk.
Six months later, Zim coincidentally found a planet named Earth, assuming it was the "mysterious planet" the Tallest had mentioned.

Nicolai Stepanowitsch Turczaninow

Nicolai Stepanowitsch Turczaninow (1796 - 1863) was a Russian botanist. He was born in Nikitovka, in the south of European Russia near the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. He first identified several genera and many species of plants. Several species have been named after him.
He is also known as Nikolai Stepanovich Turchaninov and Nikolaus von Turczaninow.
Turczaninow was born in 1796 (probably in May) in the town of Nikitovka, Voronezh Oblast (now in the Krasnogvardeysky District, Belgorod Oblast), Russian Empire.
In 1810 he was in high school in the city of Voronezh and later studied in the University of Kharkiv. In 1814 he graduated from Kharkiv and went to Saint Petersburg (St. Petersburg) to work with the government.
While he was in St. Petersburg, Turczaninow studied the plants of the area of that city and, in 1825, he published a "List of plants of the area of Saint Petersburg" with 646 species of plants that he found.
In 1828, Turczaninow was sent to Irkutsk, eastern Siberia, to work with the government of the region. In his free time he could travel around the Lake Baikal area, collecting many plants that later he sent some to St. Petersburg and keeping the rest for his own herbarium.
He became a "Fellow" of the Imperial Botanical Garden of St. Petersburg in 1830 so he could explore the Siberian region between the "Altai Mountains and the eastern ocean" (Pacific Ocean).
He collected plants in the Lake Baikal region and other regions, including northern China and Mongolia. He sent the collected plants and seeds to the St. Petersburg Botanical Garden, keeping some copies in his herbarium. In 1831, 1832 and 1834 Turczaninov wrote some articles in the "Bulletin de la Société impériale des naturalistes de Moscou" ("Bulletin of the Imperial Society of Naturalists of Moscow") on the botany of Siberia and Mongolia.
In 1837 he was sent more to west to the town of Krasnoyarsk, and later he became Governor of the region. In Krasnioarsk, Turczaninov began to publish "Flora Baikalensi-Dahurica" in separate parts from 1842 to 1857 in the Bulletin de la Société impériale des naturalists de Moscow. He wrote those articles in Latin. Later all these articles were published in 2 volumes with the first part (introduction) written in French.
When he was 49 years old, in 1845, and after 17 years in Siberia, Turczaninov went to live in Taganrog on the Sea of Azov near the Black Sea. In Taganrog, Turczaninov fell from a ladder and broke one leg; this affected his life and he could not travel to South America as he wanted. In 1847, Turczaninov move to the city of Kharkiv to work in the herbarium of the University of Kharkiv.
Turczaninov died in Kharkiv on 26 December 1863.
In 1857, The Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg gave him the Demidov Prize because of his contribution to Russian botany. And the University of Kharkiv named him a member of honour.
Several species of plantas are named after Turczaninov, and the Altai State University publishes the bulletin "Turczaninowia" ( for the printed version and for the electronic version).

La Goulue was Louise Weber (13 July 1866, Clichy, Paris 30 January 1929), a French can-can dancer. She was always known by her nickname. "La Goulue" is French slang for 'greedy guts'. It came from her habit of picking up a customer's glass and drinking it while dancing past the table. 
Growing up, Weber was a poor Jewish girl who loved to dance. She would dressed up and pretended to be a glamorous star on a great stage. At 16, she was working with her mother in the laundry. Without her mother knowing, she began sneaking off to a dance hall wearing a dress she would "borrow" from one of their customers.
Weber quickly became popular because of her dancing at small clubs in Paris. She was liked for her dancing skills and her behaviour. In her routine, she teased the male audience by swirling her raised dress to reveal the heart embroidered on her panties. Another trick of hers was to kick off a man's hat with her toe. 
Later, she met the Montmartre painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir. He introduced her to a group of models who earned money posing for artists and photographers.

Pope Leo I

Leo I (; c. 400 – 10 November 461), also known as Leo the Great, was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 45th Pope from 29 September 440 to his death on 10 November 461.
Nothing is known about his early life. Little is known about his early work in the church. The first unmistakable reference to Pope Leo is in 429 when he was only a deacon.
Leo was made Bishop of Rome on 29 September 440. In other words, he became pope.
Leo is one of only two popes who are called "the Great". The other "great" is the first pope named Gregory.
In 452, Leo I peacefully convinced Attila the Hun "not" to destroy and plunder Rome. This made him a legendary figure in Italy.
Leo also wrote many scholarly books. One of them, a "Tome" on the Nature of Christ, was read out to both the Roman Emperor and to the Patriarch of Constantinople. Afterwards, they followed Leo's recommendations, and officially accepted certain religious matters, and rejected others. These decisions had many political implications, in many areas of the Eastern Roman Empire, for centuries to come.

Donkey Kong 3

Donkey Kong 3 is an arcade video game made by Nintendo in 1984. It is the third game in the "Donkey Kong" arcade series. A port was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986. It was later re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in North America and Europe in 2008 and 2009.
Donkey Kong has taken cover in Stanley's greenhouse. Stanley is a bugman, and must stop insects from destroying his flowers. He does this by killing them with bug spray. The main goal is to shoot Donkey Kong with the bug spray and force him to the top of the vine he is on while killing the insects. When Donkey Kong gets to the top, the player moves on to the next stage. The player can also complete a stage by killing all of the insects, which forces Donkey Kong to the top. At the start of a stage, Stanley can get a special bug spray which allows him to shoot Donkey Kong up at a faster rate. It is on one of Donkey Kong's vines. It is dropped when Donkey Kong reaches the point on the vine where the bug spray is. It only lasts for a certain amount of shots.

<doc id="388949" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=388949" title="Costa Rican colón">
Costa Rican colón

The colón is the official currency of Costa Rica. It is named after Christopher Columbus, known as Cristóbal Colón in Spanish. The plural is "colones" in Spanish. The ISO 4217 code is CRC.
The symbol for the colón is a "c" with two slashes (₡). The symbol for the colón in many English language Windows keyboards can be made by pressing +.
The colón sign is not the same as the US cent sign, but the US cent sign is much more commonly available (¢). As such, it is frequently used instead of the colón's own sign in price markings and advertisements.
The colón is divided into 100 "centimos"
The colón was introduced in 1896 and replaced the Costa Rican peso. Between 1917 and 1919 coins were issued using the name centavo for the 1/100 subunit.
In 1897 gold 2, 5, 10 and 20 colones were issued. Later, silver 50 centimos and cupro-nickel 2 centimos were issued in 1903. In 1905 silver 5 and 10 centimos were issued. The 5 and 10 centimos had the initials G.C.R. ("Gobierno de Costa Rica") because they were issued by the government.
The government resumed in 1920 making 5 and 10 centimos coins with the G.C.R initials. Silver 25 centimos coins were made in 1925. The last government issued coins were brass 10 centimos coins in 1941.
In 1935, the International Bank of Costa Rica "(Banco Internacional de Costa Rica)" issued cupro-nickel coins of 25 and 50 centimos and 1 colón. These had the initials B.I.C.R.
The National Bank made 25 and 50 centimos coins in 1937. This bank also issued 1 colón coins. These coins had the initials B.N.C.R. 5 and 10 centimos coins were made in 1942. 2 colones coins were made in 1948.
The Central Bank of Costa Rica took over coin production in 1951. These coins had the initials B.C.C.R. "(Banco Central de Costa Rica)".
The first Banco Central coins were 5 and 10 centimos. Then 1 and 2 colones coins in 1954. In 1965, 50 centimos coins were made. 25 centimos coins were made in 1967.
By 1983, 5 and 10 centimos coins were discontinued. 25 centimos to 2 colon coins were made smaller in size. By this time 5, 10 and 20 colon coins were made. 
By 1998, small brass 1, 5 and 10 colon coins were made. In this same year 25, 50 & 100 colones coins were added. In 2003, 500 colones coins were made. In 2006 aluminium 5 and 10 colones coins were made.
1 colón coins are no longer used. In 2009 the large silver-colored ¢5, ¢10 & ¢20 were withdrawn. There are only the smaller silver-colored ¢5 and ¢10 coins and gold-colored ¢5, ¢10, ¢25, ¢50, ¢100 & ¢500 coins.
Four private banks, the "Banco Anglo–Costarricense", the "Banco Comercial de Costa Rica", the "Banco de Costa Rica" and the "Banco Mercantil de Costa Rica", issued notes between 1864 and 1917.
The Banco Anglo–Costarricense was established in 1864 and issued notes from 1864 to 1917. It later became a state-owned bank and in 1994 went bankrupt and closed. Notes were issued in denominations of 1, 25, 50, and 100 pesos as well as 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 colones. Some 1, 5, 10 and 20 colon notes (unsigned and undated) were released in 1963 when the bank celebrated its 100th anniversary. Some had "Muestra sin Valor" ("sample without value") printed on them in order to nullify the legal tender status and to prevent people from selling them. Most, however, didn't have that printed on them, which makes it harder nowadays to find notes with the seal.
The Banco de Costa Rica was established in 1890 and issued notes from 1890 to 1914. It is currently a state-owned bank. Notes were issued in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 100 pesos as well as 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 colones.
The Banco Comercial de Costa Rica issued notes between 1906 and 1914 in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 colones. The Banco Mercantil de Costa Rica issued notes between 1910 and 1916, also in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 colones.
The government issued gold certificates in 1897 for 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 colones. Between 1902 and 1917, it issued silver certificates for 50 centimos, 1, 2, 50 and 100 colones.
In 1914, the "Banco Internacional de Costa Rica" introduced notes in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 colones, to which 25 and 50 centimos, 1 and 2 colones were added in 1918. Although 25 centimos were not issued after 1919, the other denominations continued to be issued until 1936. After 1917, the Banco Internacional's notes were the only issued for circulation.
In 1937, the "Banco Nacional de Costa Rica" took over paper money issuing and issued notes for 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 colones until 1949. Many of the early notes were provisional issues overprinted on notes of the Banco Internacional, including the 1 colón notes which were briefly issued.
The "Banco Central de Costa Rica" began issuing paper money in 1950, with notes for 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 colones. The first notes were provisional issues produced from Banco Nacional notes (unsigned and undated). The Central Bank printed on them the corresponding signatures and dates, and the legend "BANCO CENTRAL DE COSTA RICA" over "BANCO NACIONAL DE COSTA RICA". Regular issues of notes began in 1951, but a second provisional issue of 2 colon notes was made in 1967. 1000 colon notes were added in 1958, followed by 500 colones in 1973, 5000 colones in 1992, and 2000 and 10,000 colones in 1997.
Whenever a banknote of a specific denomination is changed (design, security features, colour, etc.), a new series is released. Every banknote issued by this bank measures approximately 6.6 cm x 15.5 cm. Every note also has the serial and series numbers printed in red ink. Exceptions occurred with:
Every issue also features the signatures, date, and the agreement number printed in black.
The 1983 "Z" series of the 20 colón note was an experimental issue of the American Banknote Company which made the notes out of a polymer. To date, this has been the only Costa Rican note made of that material.
Since 2012, Costa Rican banknotes are undergoing a reform and are being replaced by a new model. Two new denominations were introduced as part of the reform; 20,000 and 50,000 colones. The old notes will all be withdrawn from circulation and be replaced by new ones. The new banknotes will have different colors, shapes and images than their predecessors. All the denominations have a different length so that people with visual impairments can recognize the banknotes easily.
On February 6, 2011, the United States dollar was worth 508.11 colones. The colón has had an unusual relationship with the U.S. dollar that may best be described as a "crawling peg"; instead of being defined by a constant value to the dollar, the colón instead would grow progressively weaker at a fixed rate of about 3.294 colones per dollar per month. On October 16, 2006, however, this crawling peg was modified due to weakness in the U.S. dollar and the perception that the colón is now undervalued. The exchange rate is now free to float within a currency band referenced to the United States dollar. The floor of the band has been set at a fixed value, while the ceiling changes at a fixed rate. In practice the exchange rate has remained fixed at the lower value of the currency band.
Since October 17, 2006 the colón is no longer bound to controlled devaluations (known in Costa Rica as "minidevaluaciones") by the Central Bank of Costa Rica. With the new system, "sistema cambiario de bandas", the exchange rates posted by the Central Bank are a "reference" and each authorized financial institution can determine their value independently in hopes that the free market will provide a mechanism to keep them reasonable.
The colón is sometimes referred to as the "peso", which was the name of the Costa Rican currency before the colón, until 1896. This is very common across Latin American countries, where most have (or had at some point) currencies called pesos. Another nickname is "caña" (Spanish for sugar cane, plural cañas) but this nickname is more often used in plural for amounts under 100 colones. For example: 5 cañas, 10 cañas, 20 cañas. This term has become less popular.
"Teja" (roof tile in Spanish) is used as another nickname. It means one hundred colones. For example: five hundred colones are called "cinco tejas". "Teja" can also be used for 100,000 colones. "Media Teja" (half a roof tile in Spanish) is used for 50 colones or 50,000 colones.
The one thousand colones note is called "un rojo" (one red) because of its red color.

Sainte-Mélanie, Quebec

Sainte-Mélanie is a municipality in the Lanaudière region of Quebec, Canada. It is part of the Joliette Regional County Municipality. It is located along the western shores of the L'Assomption River.
Sainte-Mélanie used to be part of the territory of the Ailleboust Seignory, which was given to Jean d'Ailleboust d'Argenteuil (1694-1785) in 1736. By 1800, Pierre-Louis Panet (1761-1812) was Lord of Ailleboust. His daughter Charlotte-Mélanie Panet (1794-1872) may have been the source of the name Sainte-Mélanie, also a reference to Melania the Younger (383-439). Charlotte-Mélanie's husband, Marc-Antoine-Louis Lévesque (1782-1833), donated the land in 1814 for a chapel that was built in 1830. The Parish of Sainte-Mélanie was founded in 1832. Four years later, in 1836, the post office opened under the name Daillebout.

Long-tailed river stingray

The long-tailed river stingray or antenna ray, "Plesiotrygon iwamae", is a species of freshwater stingray in the family Potamotrygonidae.
These animals have a long tail, small eyes, and few pectoral-fin radials.
They eat worms, crustaceans, mollusks, and small bottom fish (such as small catfish). They can detect electrical and chemical signals from prey in mud and sand.
The species was mentioned in 1987 by Hugo P. Castello from Museu de Zoologia, University of São Paulo. Examples were then found in other museums that had been given wrong names or identified incorrectly.
This fish does not appear often in the aquarium trade.

Trecento

Trecento was the Italian word for the Italian culture during the 14th century.
The Trecento is considered the beginning of the Italian Renaissance cultural movement. It is sometimes called "Proto-Renaissance".
One of the most important centres of art and architecture in this period is Florence, a political, economical and cultural pole of Italy.
The most important artists who represent this period are Giotto, in painting, and Donatello, in sculpture. Indeed the Trecento begins with the works of the painter Giotto and includes Taddeo Gaddi, Orcagna, Altichiero and the sculptor Nicola Pisano. 
In 1334 Giotto was appointed chief architect to Florence Cathedral, of which the "Campanile" (founded by him on July 18, 1334 AD) bears his name, but was not completed to his design. Most of the famous Florence Cathedral, an architecture masterpiece, was built during the Trecento.
Important sculptors included two pupils of Giovanni Pisano: Arnolfo di Cambio and Tino di Camaino, and Bonino da Campione.
The Trecento was also famous as a time of heightened literary activity, with writers working in the vernacular instead of Latin. Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio were the leading writers of the age. Dante produced his famous "La Divina commedia" (The Divine Comedy), a summation of the medieval worldview, and Petrarch wrote verse in a lyrical style influenced by the Provençal poetry of the troubadours.
In music, the Trecento was a time of vigorous activity in Italy. Musicians and composers of the Trecento included the renowned Francesco Landini, as well as Maestro Piero, Gherardello da Firenze, Jacopo da Bologna, Giovanni da Cascia, Paolo "Tenorista" da Firenze, Niccolò da Perugia, Bartolino da Padova, Antonio Zachara da Teramo and Matteo da Perugia.

Pyramid (geometry)

A pyramid is a three-dimensional shape. It has triangular sides that come together in a point at the top, call the "apex". A pyramid with a square base (bottom) and four sides is called a square pyramid. A pyramid with a triangular base and three sides is called a tetrahedron.
The formula for the volume of a pyramid is:
This means that one must find the volume by multiplying the base (B) by the height (h), then dividing the product by three.
The base is also known as the product of the length and the width, thus this formula could alternatively be written:

Mendeleev's predicted elements

In 1869, Professor Dmitri Mendeleev created the first periodic table of chemical elements. He arranged the elements from the lightest one to the heaviest one. When he proposed his periodic table, he placed empty spaces between some elements. He said that the empty spaces were for undiscovered elements. Mendeleev had also predicted the properties of these undiscovered elements.
Mendeleev gave temporary names for the undiscovered elements. He used the prefixes eka-, dvi- and tri- and combined it with any known elements in the same group with the undiscovered element. Eka-, dvi- and tri- are numbers 1, 2 and 3 in the Sanskrit language. The use of the prefix depends on how far the known element is from the unknown element. For example, germanium was called eka-silicon because silicon is placed one row above germanium, and rhenium was called dvi-manganese because manganese is placed two rows above rhenium. The names of these elements were changed after they were discovered.
Other scientists use the eka- prefix, too. Eka- is also used in the names of elements that Mendeleev did not predict. Before francium was discovered, it was called "eka-caesium", and before astatine was discovered, it was called "eka-iodine". The eka- prefix is also used to name transuranic elements (elements after uranium). For example, ununoctium is also called "eka-radon", and untriennium (element number 139) is also called "eka-actinium". Today, the IUPAC uses the systematic element name to give new elements a temporary name. This new way of naming elements depends on the atomic number of the element. It does not depend on the position of the element in the periodic table.

Christopher Jones

Christopher Jones (about 1570 – about 5 March 1622) was Master of the "Mayflower" when the ship carried the Pilgrims to North America in 1620. 
Jones was born about 1570 to Christopher and Sybil Jones of Harwich, co. Essex, England. Harwich records for the year of his birth are missing. Christopher was his father's eldest son. He lived in a house on High Street. Jones was eight when his father died. Christopher was left his father's share in the ship "Marie Fortune" when he turned eighteen. His brother Roger was left an eighth part and stock in the ship "Centurion" when he turned eighteen. Christopher's mother married Robert Russell on 20 September 1579.
On 23 December 1593, Jones married Sarah Twitt, the daughter of a fairly wealthy Harwich merchant. She lived across the street from Jones in Harwich. Within a year of their marriage in St. Nicholas's Church, Harwich, they had a son, Thomas. The boy was baptized on 1 December 1595. He died a few months later on 17 April 1596. Sarah's father died in 1599, leaving Christopher and Sarah Jones a twelfth share in the ship "Apollo". Sarah died in 1603. She was buried on 23 May 1603 in Harwich. 
Six months after his wife's death, Jones married Josian Gray in St. Nicholas' church. She was the widow of Richard Gray, and the daughter of Thomas Thompson. Both men were ship owners and Harwich merchants. The Joneses had eight children, four born in Harwich and four born in Rotherhithe where the family moved in 1609.
By the time of his first wedding, Jones' father had died. He left Jones his share in the ship "Mary Fortune". Sarah Twitt received £20 and a twelfth share in the ship "Apollo" at her father's death. In 1601, Jones was elected freeman of the Borough of Harwich. He served as tax assessor and jury member in Harwich. 
His name is listed as one of the 24 capital burgesses on the Great Charter granted to the Borough by James I in 1604. In 1605, he was accused of keeping hunting dogs (greyhounds), an interest open only to gentlemen whose land was valued at more than 40 shillings per year.
With what wealth he had acquired through inheritance and marriage, Jones was able to pursue a seafaring career. He built the ship, "Josian", named after his wife. He traded between England and Europe with voyages to Norway, Bordeaux, and Rochelle. He carried woolen cloth on outward bound voyages and wine on return trips.
Jones was part owner in the "Mayflower". He had been the master of the ship for about 11 years when it was hired to carry the Pilgrims to North America. Jones and his 102 passengers and 30-40 crew members left Plymouth, England in September 1620. They arrived in North America in November. Jones remained in the New World through a harsh winter and returned to England in the spring of 1621.
Jones' wintering in the New World very likely undermined his health. He died about 5 March 1622. His burial is recorded in the Parish Register of St Mary's church, Rotherhithe, as 5 March 1622. His house still stands in Harwich on King's Head St.

Goldberg Variations

The Goldberg Variations, BWV 988 is a work for keyboard by Johann Sebastian Bach. It was written about 1741. The work consists of an aria and thirty variations. The aria was not original with Bach, but was probably based on a now lost French dance tune. The work is believed to have been commissioned by a pupil of Bach's named J. G. Goldberg. Goldberg was a celebrated virtuoso, and used the work to lull his insomniac employer Count Keyserkingk to sleep. 
The basic harmonies and structure of the aria remain consistent from variation to variation. The work ends with a quodlibet, a humorous combination of two popular tunes. John Keillor writes, "The work is sublime and compassionate, graceful, warm, and relentlessly intricate, a demonstration of unmatched craft in music history and genuine, poetic imagination." In modern times, the work is played on both the harpsichord and the piano.

Witches' Sabbath

The term Witches' Sabbath was used to describe the belief that there were people, called witches, who regularly met for secret gatherings. The name is used for the gathering. One part of the name refers to the Sabbath, the day of rest in Judaism and other Abrahamic religions. The term was in common use in the Middle Ages. At that time, the Jews were shown as evil in many European countries. It was believed that the witches killed people in secret rituals or poisoned wells during the Witches Sabbath. From about the 14th century, the Holy Inquisition used this belief to organise pogroms against people it called heretics. The Catholic Church developed a whole set of ideas about witches. According to this theory, the Witches Sabbath is one of the five elements that characterize a witch. The other elements are witches' flight, a pact with the devil, the idea that they entered into a sexual relationship with the devil, and that they used black magic to harm people. The idea of a conspiracy theory was thematised more and more in the fifteenth century. People feared a secret society or sect of witches and warlocks (male witches) that would do harm.

Punched tape

Punched tape is a medium for data storage. It is made of a long strip with holes in it. The holes are used to represent information. The principle is the same as that of a punched card, except that the length is variable. Punched tape was widely used in the 1950s and 1960s, but was later replaced by other media. Punched tape was first used to program looms, in the 18th century. Similar looms are still used for waving Tartans, but the punched tape is made of metal platelets today. Another use of punched tape is in barrel organs. 
20th century teleprinters also use punched tape. Herman Hollerith used punched tape for a census, in 1890. Gilbert Vernam, a telecommunication engineer developed the Vernam cipher in 1917. This cipher could be used with punched tape. Vernam combined a character of the punched tape, with one of a key, to give the encoded character. Combining the ecoded character with the key again gives the plain text. This is in fact an exclusive disjunction, even though Vernam used a different name. It was an automated one-time pad. The NSA has called this patent "perhaps one of the most important in the history of cryptography."
There are different formats for punching tapes. Today, two formats are left, which are mechanically compatible. One is used in Telex and early computing applications. The strip is wide, and has five positions, plus a row that serves for feeding, and is always punched. The feeding row is between positions three and four. Data positions use a quadratic raster of a width of . The other format is mainly used in computing. The strip is wide, and has eight positions. Like the other format, the feeding row is between holes three and four. Both formats save ten rows of data (or characters) on a length of . If the 5 position strip is put on top of the 8 position one, the first five holes (and the feeding row) have the same position. Thi means that a reader which is capable of reading 8-position tape can also read 5-position tape. There are devices which can output both formats.
It is possible to encode 256 different characters on an 8 hole tape, the five hole tape can hold 32 different characters. The Baudot code which is used for encoding has two special characters that allow to switch between two halves of a code. This means that the five position punchtape can encode 59 different characters.
Punched tape has some advantages:

Pope Francis

Pope Francis (, , ; born Jorge Mario Bergoglio on 17 December 1936) is the 266th and current pope of the Catholic Church. He was elected on 13 March 2013. He chose the name Francis to honor St. Francis of Assisi. 
Francis is the first Jesuit pope. He is also the first pope in more than a millennium who is not European. He is the first pope ever to come from the Americas, and the first from the Southern Hemisphere.
From 1998 until he was elected as the pope, Francis was the Archbishop of Buenos Aires. Throughout his life, both as an individual and a religious leader, he has been known for his humility, his concern for the poor, and his commitment to dialogue as a way to build bridges between people of all backgrounds, beliefs, and faiths. He has expressed concern about the effects of global warming (climate change). In his 2015 encyclical "Laudato si"' , he wrote about these issues, and others.
Since his election to the papacy, he has shown a simpler and less formal approach to the office, choosing to live in the Vatican guesthouse and not the papal residence. 
Jorge Mario Bergoglio was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He was one of the children of Mario Bergoglio, an Italian railway accountant, and Regina Maria Bergoglio (née Sívori), a housewife.
He received a master's degree in philosophy and theology from the University of Buenos Aires. After that, he studied at the seminary in Villa Devoto. He entered the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) on 11 March 1958.
Bergoglio became a member of the Society of Jesus in 1958. He was made a priest in 1969. In 1973, he was named "provincial" or head of the Jesuits in Argentina. In the mid-1980's, he began work on a doctoral degree at Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology in Frankfurt, Germany.
Pope John Paul II appointed Bergoglio the Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998. During the 2001 Consistory, Pope named Bergoglio as a Cardinal.
Cardinal Bergoglio was elected on March 13, 2013. He chose the name "Francis" to honor St. Francis of Assisi. Just after he was elected, Francis told a newspaper how he chose the new name:
""Let me tell you a story," he said. He then [explained] how during the conclave he had sat next to Cardinal Cláudio Hummes of Brazil, whom he called "a great friend." After the voting, Cardinal Hummes "hugged me, he kissed me and he said, 'Don't forget the poor!' And that word entered here," the pope said, pointing to his heart. "I thought of wars, while the voting continued, though all the votes," he said ... "And Francis is the man of peace. And that way the name came about, came into my heart: Francis of Assisi."" 
Despite both his parents being Italians, Francis is the first non-European pope since Pope Gregory III in the 8th century.
Pope Francis is the first pope to speak to a session of the United States Congress. He spoke there during his visit to the United States on September 24, 2015.
Personally, Pope Francis likes to read books by authors such as Friedrich Hölderlin, Jorge Luis Borges or Fyodor Dostoevsky. He likes to watch movies of Italian neorealism, and likes to go to the opera.
He is also interested in football. He is an active member of San Lorenzo de Almagro, which is one of the teams in the "Primera División" league.
When Bergoglio was a Cardinal, his views about the celibacy of priests were recorded in the book "On Heaven and Earth." The book is a record of conversations he had with a Buenos Aires rabbi. In this book, he said that celibacy "is a matter of discipline, not of faith. It can change." However, he added: "For the moment, I am in favor of maintaining celibacy, with all its [positive and negative parts], because we have ten centuries of good experiences rather than failures [...] Tradition has weight and validity." 
He also said that "in the Byzantine, Ukrainian, Russian, and Greek Catholic Churches [...] the priests can be married, but the bishops have to be celibate". He said that many of those in Western Catholicism who are pushing for more discussion about the issue do so from a position of "pragmatism", based on a loss of manpower. He states that "If, hypothetically, Western Catholicism were to review the issue of celibacy, I think it would do so for cultural reasons (as in the East), not so much as a universal option." He emphasized that, in the meantime, the rule must be strictly followed, and any priest who cannot obey it "has to leave the ministry."
National Catholic Reporter Vatican analyst Thomas Reese, also a Jesuit, called Bergoglio's use of "conditional language" regarding the rule of celibacy "remarkable." He said that phrases like "for the moment" and "for now" are "not the kind of qualifications one normally hears when bishops and cardinals discuss celibacy."
Pope Francis supports the Catholic teaching that homosexual acts are immoral. However, he has said that gay people should be treated with respect. Bergoglio is against same-sex marriage. In 2011, he called it "the Devil's work". 
Argentina considered legalizing same-sex marriage in 2010. At that time, Bergoglio was against this legislation. He called it a "real and dire anthropological throwback." In July 2010, while the law was under consideration, he wrote a letter to Argentina's cloistered nuns in which he said:
After "L'Osservatore Romano" reported this, several priests expressed their support for the law. Gay people believe that the church's opposition and Bergoglio's language actually helped the law get passed. They also think that Catholic officials reacted by taking a less harsh tone in later debates on social issues such as parental surrogacy.
On July 29, 2013, Pope Francis gave an interview to some journalists who were traveling with him. When asked if there should be gay priests, Pope Francis replied: Afterwards, when asked if women should become priests, Francis replied: 
Three days after being elected Pope, Pope Francis told thousands of news reporters:
"[Since] many of you do not belong to the Catholic Church, and others are not believers, I give this blessing from my heart, in silence, to each one of you, respecting the conscience of each one of you, but knowing that each one of you is a child of God. May God bless you."
It is very rare for a Pope to bless people who are not Catholics. By doing this, the Pope was showing that he accepted people who belonged to different religions.
In a speech on 20 March, Pope Francis said that some people do not follow any religion, but still search "for truth, goodness and beauty." He said these people are important allies in protecting human dignity; making peace; and caring for the Earth. This meant the Pope was saying atheists could be allies of the Catholic Church, instead of enemies. 
In the same speech, the Pope said that Catholic and Jewish people are connected "by a most special spiritual bond." To Muslim leaders at the speech he said: "[To] Muslims, who worship God as one, living and merciful, and [call on] him in prayer... I greatly appreciate your presence ... [In] it, I see a ... sign of a will to grow in mutual esteem and in cooperation for the common good of humanity." 
In September 2013, Francis wrote a letter that was published in "La Repubblica" newspaper. The letter said that atheists would be forgiven by God if they followed their consciences and did what they thought was right. The newspaper's editor, who is not a Catholic, wrote back with a list of questions. Francis wrote back:
"You ask me if the God of the Christians forgives those who don't believe and who don't seek the faith. I start by saying—and this is the [most important] thing—that God's mercy has no limits if you go to him with a sincere and [truly sorry] heart. The issue for those who do not believe in God is to obey their conscience. Sin, even for those who have no faith, exists when people disobey their conscience." 
Francis was named 2013 Time Person of the Year in December 2013.

Reynaldo Bignone

Reynaldo Benito Antonio Bignone (born January 21, 1928) is an Argentine general. He was the dictatorial President of Argentina from July 1, 1982 to December 10, 1983. In 2010, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in the kidnappings, torture, and murders of the Dirty War.
Bignone was born on January 21, 1928 in Morón, Buenos Aires, Argentina. He studied at the National War College. He was never married and had no children. 
On April 20, 2010, Bignone was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his involvement in the kidnapping, torture and murder of 56 people, including guerrilla fighters, at the extermination center in the Campo de Mayo military complex.
On April 14, 2011, Reynaldo Bignone was sentenced to life in prison.
On December 29, 2011, Bignone received a further 15-year prison sentence for crimes against humanity. That was for setting up a secret torture center inside a hospital during the 1976 military coup.
On July 5, 2012, Bignone was sentenced to 15 years in prison. That was for his participation in a scheme to steal babies from parents detained by the military regime.

Elizabeth Fry

Elizabeth "Betsy" Fry (21 May 1780 – 12 October 1845), "née" Gurney, was an English prison reformer and social reformer. She was also a Quaker and a Christian philanthropist. She has sometimes been referred to as the "angel of prisons".
Fry was very important in the creation of legislation to make the treatment of prisoners more humane. She was supported in her efforts by the monarch at the time, Queen Victoria. She was especially interested in women and children. Fry also wrote a book about prisons in Scotland and Northern England. Since 2001, she has been shown on the Bank of England £5 note.
Fry was born in the Gurney court which is in Norwich, Norfolk. The Gurneys were a Quaker family. Her family home was called the Earlham Hall. This is now part of the University of East Anglia. John Gurney (her father) worked in the Gurney's Bank. Catherine (her mother) was part of the Barclay family. They were the founders of the Barclay's Bank. Elizabeth's mother died when she was only 12 years old.
Fry was one of the eldest girls in her family. After her mother died she helped take care of her younger brothers and sisters.

Alajuela Province

Alajuela is a province of Costa Rica. It is in the north-central part of the country, bordering Nicaragua. The provincial capital is the city of Alajuela.
The Alajuela province borders the provinces of Heredia to the east, San José to the south, Puntarenas to the southwest and Guanacaste to the west. Nicaragua is to the north of the province.
Alajuela is the third largest province of Costa Rica, after the Puntarenas and Guanacaste provinces, with an area of .
The province is in the western part of the Central Valley and is crossed by the "Cordillera Central" ("Central mountain range) and the volcanic "Cordillera de Guanacaste" ("Guanacaste mountain range). In the northern part, along the border with Nicaragua, are the plains of the San Carlos and Frío rivers.
Two of the most active Costa Rican volcanoes are in this province: the Poás, high, and the Arenal, high.
The people of the province are known as "Alajuelenses", both men and women.
The Alajuela province had a population, in 2011, of 848,146, for a population density of inhabitants/km. The canton of Alajuela, with 254,886 inhabitants, is the canton with more inhabitants.
Evolution of the population in Alajuela
The Alajuela province is divided in 15 cantons, which are divided into 113 Districts.
The main economic activity in the province is farming. In the southern part of the province, tropical ornamentals, coffee, tubers, and Leaf vegetables are the major crops. Toward the north and northeast, rice, corn, pineapple, bananas, and sugarcane are important crops.
There is also an important cattle raising industry in the province, mainly in the San Carlos canton.
Alajuela has attracted many export-orientated manufacturing companies, especially within the free trade zones around the municipality of Alajuela.

Pérez Zeledón (canton)

Pérez Zeledón is the name of the 19th canton of the province of San José in Costa Rica. The canton has an area of . It has a population of 134,534. The capital city of the canton is San Isidro de El General.
The canton's boundaries are made by Río Savegre river, Río Guabo river, and the coastal mountain ranges. The canton has the highest mountains peaks of the Cordillera de Talamanca (Talamanca Mountain Range) on the east. In the middle of the canton, the Río General river goes from north to south.
The canton of Pérez Zeledón is divided into 11 districts ("distritos"):
The canton of Pérez Zeledón was made 9 October 1931. It was granted 4 districts: Ureña, El General, Daniel Flores, and Rivas. Ureña was the capital.
At the end of the 19th century, between 1870 and 1899, there were a few families living in the El General valley. The hamlets "(Spanish: Caseríos)" of El General, Palmares, Rivas, and Ureña were populated from 1900 onward.
The "Caserío" of Ureña grew more. By 1911, during Ricardo Jiménez Oreamuno's government, the Refuges of Ojo de Agua, El Cerro de la Muerte, and División were created. These refuges further advanced the growth of the region.
San Isidro de El General, Pérez Zeledón's capital, was given the title of "Ciudad Mártir". This was because of the civil war of 1948 that happened here.
Decree Nº274 gave the city its title. This decree established official recognition of the city's participation in the civil war of 1948. A section of the decree states (in Spanish):
Which in English would translate into:
Pérez Zeledón was also the location of major battles during the Costa Rican Civil War. One battle was the Battle of San Isidro de El General. It happened around 6:30 am. 200 government forces fought the rebels at the city's central park. The battle was won by José Figueres Ferrer and his rebels. This battle secured the southern pacific region of Costa Rica for the rebels.
The canton of Pérez Zeledón's economy is characterized by agriculture, livestock, trade, industry and tourism. One fact that has helped this economy is the canton's geographic location; it is a 'bridge' between Costa Rica's capital (San José) and the southern areas that border Panamá.
Important farming activities:
The first two products are the most important in the region.
Livestock activities are also important. Pigs and cattle being the most important. The cattle is used for meat and dairy products.
Commercial activities have also become important. There are important credit unions, banks, local companies, media, and various other companies of the San José operating in the canton.
Its main attraction is ecological diversity. There is the Chirripó National Park (one of the highest peak in Central America and the Caribbean).
Another park in the area is the Parque Internacional La Amistad.
The first elementary school in Pérez Zeledón was established during Ascensión Esquivel Ibarra's government (1902-1906). It was called Escuela Mixta de Ureña and was located in the Ureña district, south of San Isidro de El General's central park. After the Costa Rican Civil War the school was moved to a new building. It currently has the name "Escuela 12 de Marzo", in honor of the start of the Costa Rican Civil War. It had just ended when the school was rebuilt at its current location.

I've been thinking that it might be beneficial to begin something similar to Wikisource's "proofread of the month", where everyone proofreads a work for a month. We could call it "expansion/improvement of the month" or whatever, the name isn't incredibly important, but the idea would be that everyone focuses on expanding and improving a particular article for a month. (We could shorten or lengthen the time period if desired.) If the community likes this idea, we could use a proposals page to select the article or choose a completely random article from . Obviously, editors wouldn't be restricted to just that one article and contribution wouldn't be mandatory, but I think it could help a lot with improving our article quality.

One problem I am seeing here (after looking at the faq/help above) is that for new articles, the pen icon should be visible but isn't shown if the page is not listed in wikidate (which is obviously isn't).

My thinking is since this is a Simple English Wiki, why would we be using the short citations styles with a separate bibliography? Why not standardize on using full citation styles, where the information is in one place? At least consider make it a recommended style. The reasoning being it is easier for younger readers (and those newer to English) to look up a reference if everything is on one line (e.g. author, title, (city: publisher, year), page #).

I'd like to get some opinions, please. An editor is adding information about people's political party affiliation using BuzzFeed as a source.

Hi,
The "Heisenberg's uncertainty principle" article in Simple Wikipedia is, in my opinion, a little bit flawed. One statement is:
"The minimum range of error in position (x) times the minimum range of error in momentum (p) is, at a minimum, about equal to the Planck constant."
What is the need for writing "about"? Can't we write the correct form of the equation((delta)x*(delta)p>=(h/4pi))? Also, the image shown (which is a mathematical statement of the above) doesn't have /4pi either. Shouldn't somebody correct it?

The relevant section of the policy is , which gives six steps for repairing or removing dead links. I've fixed a few more of the links (although I'm a bit late and the Main Page has moved onto another rotation now), so there are now seven dead links remaining. A dead web-only source can be considered unverifiable if you can't find another copy, but almost all of the dead links remaining are media sources (and therefore, the links are probably "convenience links" to online copies of newspaper articles). If there are no other copies or replacements, you can just remove the link. () 03:17, 5 April 2013 (UTC)

Has the Simple English Wikipedia considered establishing associations with smaller language Wikipedias? This could especially be useful in countries where the official language is English, but large numbers of the population do not know English. If in that language it is extremely difficult to write about a scientific topic perhaps users may be directed to the Simple English Wikipedia.
As for ideas on possibilities for partnership, here is a listing of indigenous languages in countries with English as a second language, with Wikipedias:

I find that some of the articles are missing the basic descriptions. 
For example; most objects described in wikipedia and especially in the simple wiki are missing key descriptions like:
'a cat has four legs'. Nowhere in the Cat area is a description that says this animal has 4 legs. 
It would makes sense to set up a team of volunteers to take each object and add a 'description' area, that describes 'that object' in it's most common occurrence (as it would in rare circumstances be open to debate). This would also help those with visual impairments to find out about an object. I would suggest a description or table that states: shape, colour, density, hardness, reflectiveness and appendages (legs, arms, branches). It could also describe behavior, noises etc. 
I find this difficult as I wanted to make a program using simple wiki that describes the basics of each common animal's features to children age 1-5. Just because children require this information, doesn't mean the simple wiki should exclude the simple references, in life. :-) 
Has this been missed as it's an encyclopedia created by adults for adults? 
It raises many questions and if anyone knows of an alternative creative commons encyclopedia that does these descriptions, I'd love to hear from you. Thanks in advance.

We have already done this on the [first 11 Wikipedias] (it, he, hu, ru, tr, uk, uz, hr, bs, sr, sh) a month ago and two days ago on the English Wikipedia. Today all the remaining Wikipedias followed.
What does having phase 2 enabled here mean?
You are now able to make use of the structured data that is available on Wikidata in your articles/infoboxes. It includes things like the symbol for a chemical element, the ISBN for a book or the top level domain of a country. (None of this will happen automatically. Someone will have to change the article or infobox template for this to happen!) The current state is just the beginning though. It will be extended based on feedback we get from you now.
How will this work?
There are two ways to access the data:
We are working on expanding the parser function so you can for example use instead of . The complete plan for this is .
Where can I test this?
You can test it on test2 if you don't want to do it in an article here.
Where can I find more information and ask questions?
We have collected the main questions in an . Please ask questions you might have on .
I want to be kept up to date about Wikidata

I seem to have lost my Twinkle. Anyone else having problems? () 08:21, 26 April 2013 (UTC)
Hello. Can someone update the article Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange? It needs to be renamed into Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, because he isn't the Prince of Orange anymore. I'm asking it here, 'cause apparently I can't rename articles. Thanks in advance! 14:40, 30 April 2013 (UTC)
Currently, we use these categories for any kind of populated place (cities, towns, etc.). However, in some countries, the term "municipality" (or "municipio") has a more specific meaning. That makes these categories unclear. For the municipality categories that are used for the more general meaning, I would like to change them from "municipalities" to "populated places". Comments? -- () 13:06, 14 April 2013 (UTC)
Oppose: I'm not sure I understand the thrust of this discussionbut. It suggests bad consequences in a Asian context. This was the subject of discussions in February 2013 here and in March 2012 here.We need to avoid the predictable controversies which follow from changing "municipalities" to "populated places". This is not a reasonable step. -- () 14:46, 17 April 2013 (UTC)
So, Jinki, may I request the following: Please lay out again in very basic terms the following, if you will be so kind. I'm not trying to be patronizing; on the contrary, I want to make sure you get a fair hearing. So:
Frankly, I am having a hard time understanding your concerns. () 16:30, 18 April 2013 (UTC)
We've been discussing this for a week. Here's a recap as I see it.
My reasons for proposing the change were:
The original suggestion was to use "populated places", but that has a specific meaning in at least one place. Creol suggested the term "settlements". I haven't seen any objection to that, and that's the term I'm currently favoring.
It seems to me -- although I recognize that I might be biased -- that most editors who commented support the change, or at least don't oppose it. Gotanda doesn't see the reason for changing. Jinki opposes, although several editors don't understand how his arguments relate to the suggestion.
Have I missed anything? -- () 18:22, 22 April 2013 (UTC)
@Auntof6 -- Re . How might this new category serve the function you had in mind when you began this thread?Thank you for creating User:Auntof6/Municipality categories#Categories that would change. If you please, explain how the change plays out in a context of the three points which are listed in the diff above? Let's work together. -- () 18:03, 25 April 2013 (UTC)
Thanks for everyone's input. I think it will make things easier to maintain, because we won't have to remember which places use which term for the collective category. Only one editor seems to have a strong objection, but he or she hasn't been able to explain how it relates to the proposed change. -- () 20:50, 28 April 2013 (UTC)
I finished with the categories on Monday. I'm now in the process of checking all the "Settlements in" categories to be sure they have their correct interwiki links. The only other thing I can think of is to make sure any commons links are still correct. Can anyone think of anything else? -- () 07:05, 1 May 2013 (UTC)

Many of the crimes in the episodes were "ripped from the headlines", meaning they were based on crimes that really happened. Episodes of the show were usually split into two parts. The first part would show the crime, the police looking for the suspect (the person they think did the crime), and the suspect being arrested. This is the "Law" part. The second part, the "Order" part, would show the trial and whether or not the suspect did the crime.

Helium-4

Helium-4 (also written He) is an isotope of helium. It is the most common isotope of helium in the universe. Out of all the helium on the Earth, 99.99986% are helium-4. The nucleus (the center) of a helium-4 atom is also known as the alpha particle. Helium-4 is made of 2 protons (the part of an atomic nucleus with a positive charge), 2 neutrons (the part of an atomic nucleus with a negative charge) and 2 electrons (the part of an atom that goes around the nucleus with a negative charge).
Many helium-4 on Earth is produced from alpha decay of heavy elements. In the Sun and the whole universe, most helium-4 is made during the Big Bang, the event that created the universe. This "Big Bang helium-4" is known as the "primordial helium". Helium-4 is also made in nuclear fusion at the center of stars. Primordial helium is not much on Earth, because most of it had escaped from the Earth when it was created and the temperatures were very high. Helium-4 on Earth was made through radioactive decay (when an atom breaks down into smaller atoms) from other elements, and it is made after the planet cooled and became solid.
One quarter of all the mass in the universe is helium-4. The rest are mostly hydrogen.
When helium-4 in its liquid form is cooled to below -271.17 °C (2.71 K), it turns into a superfluid. A superfluid is a special kind of fluid that has properties that are different from normal fluids. For example, if helium-4 as a superfluid is placed in an open container, it will climb the walls of the container and spill out. This is called a "Rollin film". It is caused by a phenomenon in quantum mechanics that is known as the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. The nucleus of helium-4 has a total spin of zero (an integer), and this makes it a boson. Now, the superfluid behaviour is a form of the Bose-Einstein condensate that can only be done by bosons.
Helium-4 can also be found on the Moon. On Earth, it is the most common isotope of helium.

Maximum and minimum

In mathematics, the maximum and minimum of a function are the largest and smallest value that the function takes at a given point. Together they are known as the extrema (singular: extremum).
Minimum means the least you can do of something. For example, if the minimum amount of dollars you must pay for something is seven, then you can not pay six dollars or less (you must pay at least seven). You can do more than the minimum, but no less. Maximum means the most you can have of something. For example, if the maximum amount of oranges you can juggle is five, you can not juggle more than five oranges. You can do the maximum or less.
For a differentiable function formula_1, if formula_2 is an extreme value for the set of all values formula_3, and if formula_4 is in the interior of the domain of formula_1, then formula_4 is a critical point, by Fermat's theorem.

He was a slave of a Christian who had educated him. He went into business but the business failed. After some trouble, he was sent to the mines in Sardinia but was freed due to the efforts of Pope Victor I. Callistus went to work for Pope Zephrynus and became a great influence upon him.
He was a very unpopular pope to the theologians of the day.
His tomb was discovered in 1960 in the cemetary of Calepodius and can be seen even today. His feast day is celebrated on October 14.

Origen

Origen (or Origenes, also Origen(es) Adamantius) was an early Christian scholar. He lived in Alexandria in the 3rd century. He was born in the year 185 or 186, and proably died around the year 254. Today, he is regarded as one of the Church Fathers, but not as a Saint. This is probably because he had some ideas, which were declared to be false later on. These ideas included that the human soul existed before conception, and entered the human body before birth (generally known as pre-existence). Another idea was that of the souls entering a different human body after death. A third idea, called Apokatastasis, is that the reign of god would be restored when the world ends. These ideas were discussed by church fathers, but it was decided that they were false beliefs. The Council of Constantinople in 453 CE posthumously excommunicated Origen, and the 2nd Council of Constantinople in 553 CE declared "apokatastasis" as heresy. However, in recent years the idea has found some reconsideration especially among Restorationist Christian groups.
His writings are included in the general collection of early Church Fathers. However, unlike many church fathers, Origen was never canonized by the Catholic Church, because some of his teachings (for example, that every man and woman, and even the devil and his demons, would ultimately be saved) directly contradicted the teachings and actions of the apostles.
Origen was a prolific writer in many branches of theology, including textual criticism, biblical exegesis and hermeneutics, philosophical theology, preaching, and spirituality. Some of his teachings, however, quickly became controversial. Notably, he frequently referred to his hypothesis of the pre-existence of souls. In the beginning all intelligent beings were united to God. In his writingas, Origen also considered the possibility, that in the end all beings, perhaps even the arch-fiend Satan, would be reconciled with God in what is called the apokatastasis ("restitution"). Origen saw the Son of God as subordinate to God the Father. Even though this view of the Trinity was common at the time, it became controversial during the Arian controversy of the fourth century. A group who came to be known as Origenists, and who firmly believed in the preexistence of souls and the apokatastasis, were declared anathema in the 6th century. This condemnation is attributed to the Second Ecumenical Council of Constantinople, though it does not appear in the council's official documents.

Solar car

Solar cars (or solar vehicles) are a special type of electric vehicle that only get their power from the sun. They use solar cells on the surface of the car to produce electricity and the electricity makes a motor turn, and that turns the wheels. They are not useful for normal driving, but once built, they can drive all day and not make any pollution. There are also some solar-powered vehicles for unusual cases, like the first rovers on Mars.
Also, there are electric vehicles that can be charged from separate solar panels, and those panels can be as big as needed. This can work to power an electric car for most daily needs. But this is not called a solar car, since it doesn't have the solar panels right on the car.
The first competition was a trip from Sydney, Australia to Perth in 1983. 
There are now several competitions to see who can build the best solar-powered car. Some of these are for college students, some are open to anybody. It is not easy to build a good solar car. This is a good test of engineering skills, and helps improve the efficiency of cars and test solar equipment.

Chemtrail conspiracy theory

According to a popular conspiracy theory, a chemtrail is a trail of chemicals left by an airplane at a high altitude. The chemicals are said to be deliberately sprayed for reasons that are kept secret by the government. Most scientists and workers in the aviation industry say that the trails left by planes are just a form of condensation. These are called contrails (condensation trails).
People who believe the theory have speculated about what purpose chemtrails may serve. Some say it is to change the weather or stop global warming. Others say that it is to control the population by spreading chemicals that are harmful to the human reproductive system. Some more recent versions of the theory say that chemtrails are being spread by companies that make genetically-modified (GMO) crops. The chemtrails supposedly contain herbicides that will only kill normal (organic) crops and will not affect the genetically-modified crops.
Some claim that specially modified planes, supposedly owned and operated by the government, are necessary to create a chemtrail. The chemicals are said to either come from the engine or from special nozzles on the plane. In some versions of the theory, the chemical is said to be barium or a barium compound, but in other versions it is aluminum oxide, or a mixture of barium compounds and aluminum oxide.
Chemtrails are not to be confused with the spraying of chemicals over short distances at a low altitude, such as aerial firefighting or crop-dusting.
Several photographs on the Internet have been claimed to show the inside of planes that spread chemtrails. They show ballast barrels installed on the inside of the plane. In reality, these are photographs of test planes or firefighting planes. The real purpose of the barrels is to simulate the weight of passengers or cargo. The barrels are filled with water, and the water can be pumped from barrel to barrel to test different weight distributions while the aircraft is in flight.

Battle of the Plains of Abraham

The Battle of the Plains of Abraham was a battle that happened on September 13, 1759. It was part of the French and Indian War, which was part of the big Seven Years' War. The Plains of Abraham is close to the Saint Lawrence River in Quebec City. It is named after Abraham Martin. The battle was the French against the British. The French leader was Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, and the British leader was James Wolfe. Both were young men. The French were wearing blue and the British were wearing red. 
The French were in their fort on the Plains of Abraham, waiting for the British to arrive. They knew the British were coming, from rumors and spies. But when the British arrived, the French were not prepared, and they did not have all their troops with them. They attacked anyway; each side had about 4500 troops. Many of the French troops that were at the battle were not trained as well as the British troops. Montcalm and Wolfe both died. The French retreated, and Quebec surrendered on September 18, 1759. The war continued in 1760, and the British captured Montreal and New France was defeated.

Pitjantjatjara

Pitjantjatjara () is the name of a nation of native Australian people. They live in the central Australian desert. The people call themselves "Aṉangu", a word which means "person" or "people" in their own language. The group is considered part of the Western Desert cultural bloc. Pitjantjatjara people are closely related to their two closest neighbours: the Yankunytjatjara and the Ngaanyatjarra. They can understand much of each other's languages. There are currently about 4,000 people from this nation living in small communities spread out across their homeland.
The homeland of the Pitjantjatjara covers north-western South Australia and the south-west of the Northern Territory. More communities are located a short distance over the border in Western Australia. The land they live in is special to them. It forms a large part of their culture and beliefs. In South Australia, they mostly live in the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands. This area is where the Pitjantjatjara language is strongest. In the Northern Territory, their country is on the south side of Lake Amadeus. It is centred around Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa, two of their most sacred sites. 
Pitjantjatara are historically a nomadic people. They lived in small family groups, travelling from one rock hole to another depending on the water and food that was available. In the mid-20th century, most families settled in new communities they built together. They have kept their culture and identity despite outside influences and attempts to force them to change. These influences come from the wider Australian community.

They originally moved to Hermannsburg and then set up a new community at Areyonga. A Lutheran mission was established in the settlement in the 1940s. In the 1970s, many people from the mission moved back to the community at Kaḻṯukatjara.

Irrunytju, Western Australia

Irrunytju (also called Wingellina) is a small Aboriginal community in Western Australia. It is located in the Goldfields-Esperance region, about southwest of the Surveyor Generals Corner (where the borders of Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory meet). There are about 150 people living in the community, most of whom are Ngaanyatjarra.
The town is surrounded by the Wingellina Hills, a set of large granite hills with mulga and mallee growth. The name of the community, "", comes from the name of a sacred site located in the hills to the south.
The area was part of the Central Australia Aboriginal Reserve when the reserve was created in 1922. In 1955, however, the borders of the reserve were moved to allow for mining and prospecting, mostly of nickel. Mining camps were set up in the area around what is now Irrunytju. In response, Aboriginal families moved to settle around these camps. Some got jobs with the miners and were paid in food rations; others were simply there to protect places of spiritual importance from outsiders. Some companies took steps to make sure their miners respected these sites; other companies did not, and several sacred sites were damaged during this period. The area was made part of the reserve again in 1972.
Once the miners left, the Aboriginal families stayed and built a permanent settlement using what was left from the mining camps (shelters, bores, etc.). The community was also given money from the federal government to help establish a permanent settlement. The community became incorporated in 1976. It became a member of the Ngaanyatjarra Council in 1981.
Irrunytju has remained on Aboriginal land since 1972. Economic activities in the area are governed under the Ngaanyatjarra Indigenous Land Use Agreement, formed in 2006. The community maintains many traditional activities, such as hunting and gathering bush tucker. The community has had its own art centre, Irrunytju Arts, since 2001.

Tjuntjuntjara, Western Australia

Tjuntjuntjara is a remote Aboriginal community in the southeast of Western Australia. It is located in the Great Victoria Desert, inside the Great Victoria Desert Nature Reserve. It is about east of Kalgoorlie. The nearest place with more people is the town of Laverton, . Tjuntjuntjara is connected to Irrunytju in the north by a dirt track.
There are about 160 people living at Tjuntjuntjara. They speak a southern variety of the Pitjantjatjara language. They identify as belonging to a group of people known as ' (meaning "from the spinifex plains"). This group of people are among those that were removed from their homelands in the 1950s and 1960s due to nuclear weapons testing at Woomera Test Range. Most of the people now living at Tjuntjuntjara were previously living at Cundeelee, then a Christian mission, further to the west. Other communities of ' people include Oak Valley and Yalata, over the border in South Australia.
Tjuntjuntjara was founded in the late 1980s. Cundeelee was being closed, so a group of elders led members back east to their homelands to set up a new community. The first choice for a location was Yakadunya (about of Tjuntjuntjara). A water bore was drilled and a temporary camp was formed, but there was not enough water in the ground. The community moved northward to what is now Tjuntjuntjara.
Tjuntjuntjara has since grown into a large community. It acts as a service centre for several outstations. These outstations are occupied at certain times of the year for hunting and gathering and ceremonies. The community is governed by a local council. Facilities and services are managed by the Paupiyala Tjarutja Aboriginal Corporation, a non-profit organisation. The community has its own health clinic. The community school, Tjuntjuntjara Remote Community School, was opened in 2008. Both the clinic and the school are helped by the federal government. Mail is flown in by plane once per week. A truck delivers food supplies to the community once every two weeks. There is no police station.
The Spinifex Arts Project was set up in 1997 for the community to create artworks.
The community is growing. There were about 40 living at Tjuntjuntjara during the 1980s. In the 2006 census, there were 150 people, and in the 2011 census there were 162 people living in 17 houses.

Scalpel

A scalpel is a very sharp knife, made to be used for surgery. Scalpels were developed for cutting through tissue. In 2013, most scalpels used for surgery had blades which are only used once. The blade is replaced after use. Sometimes, the lower part of the scalpel is re-used. The blades are made of different kinds of metal or steel. In some cases, titanium, diamond or obsidian are used. Magnetic resonance imaging uses magnetism to generate an image. This means that people performing operations in such an environment cannot use metal tools. In some cases, scalpels are replaced with lasers, or with electrocautery. Ancient Egyptian medicine used scalpels for enbalming; the material used was obsidian, it is still in use today. Medicine in ancient Rome used over 150 different tools, among them, the scalpel.

Paralegal

A paralegal is a person who works with lawyers. Paralegals know the law, and they use their knowledge to help people who are charged with a crime, people who want to charge someone with a crime, people who want to sue someone, and people who are being sued. Paralegals are similar to lawyers, but not as educated in the law. They sometimes only do what lawyers ask them to do, but can sometimes work alone.
Some companies hire paralegals instead of lawyers, because they are less expensive to hire. Paralegals go to school for a shorter amount of time than lawyers do, and they do not make as much money.
Most paralegals go to school for two to four years. They learn about different kinds of law, such as business law, criminal law, and civil law. They also learn how to work with lawyers, how to create contracts and other official agreements, and how to do research well.
Paralegals normally make around $48,000 a year. They can make as little as $35,000 a year, or as much as $60,000 a year.

Progeroid syndromes

Progeroid syndromes (PS) describes a range of genetic disorders where the affected person appears to grow older faster. All these disorders are monogenetic, meaning they come from mutations of a single gene. Most known PS mutations lead to either defects in the DNA repair mechanism, or defects in a protein known as lamin A/C.
Progeroid means "resembling old age". This definition can be applied to many different diseases. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease affects only one tissue. 
In most cases, the term "progeroid syndrome" is used for cases where the affected people only show some of the features of aging, but not all of them. In these cases, many different kinds of tissue are affected. 
Individuals with PS-related disorders often have a reduced lifespan. The most widely studied of the progeroid syndromes are Werner syndrome (WS) and Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), because they resemble natural aging.
Because of its property of accelerated aging (senescence), progeroid syndomes have been widely studied in the fields of aging,regeneration, stem cells and cancer.

Boeing 737 Next Generation

The Boeing 737 Next Generation, often called the 737NG, is a family of Boeing 737s. The 737-600, -700, -800 and -900 are all 737NG aircraft. It is the third family of Boeing 737. The family which came before it is the 737 Classic (−300/-400/-500) family. They have been made since 1996 by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. All 737s are twin-engined, narrow-body aircraft. This means that they all have two engines and only have two rows of seats.
4,293 737NG aircraft have been delivered (as of December 2012). More than 6,300 have been ordered by airlines. Southwest Airlines has more 737NGs than any other airline. Ryanair, a low-cost airline from Ireland, also has a lot of 737NGs. The only planes Ryanair has are 737-800s. The main rival of the 737NG family is the Airbus A320 family. The Boeing 737 MAX will eventually replace the 737NG.
After Airbus designed the Airbus A320, Boeing started designing a new series of Boeing 737. The "737 Next Generation" (NG) program was announced on November 17, 1993. Boeing made many changes from the 737 Classic. The wing was changed. These changes made its area bigger by 25%. The wingspan was made bigger by 16 ft (4.88 m). These changes meant that it could carry 30% more fuel. CFM56-7B engines were used. These improvements allowed the 737 to fly 900 nmi farther.
The inside of the 737 Next Generation was better than the style used on the Boeing 757-200 and the Boeing 737 Classic. It used certain parts of the Boeing 777's inside style. The style of the 737 Next Generation was made the usual style of the Boeing 757-300.
In 2010, the inside of the 737NG was changed to look like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The new design was called the Boeing Sky Interior. The Sky Interior can only be put into new aircraft. However, a different company has made a style for 737 and 757 aircraft which looks like the Sky Interior.
The first 737NG was a 737−700. The prototype −800 was finished on June 30, 1997 and first flew on July 31, 1997. The smallest 737NG, the 737−600 series, is the same size as the −500. The FAA said it was allowed to fly on August 18, 1998.
In July 2008, Boeing brought out new brakes for 737NGs. They are supposed to replace the steel brakes. They will make the brakes lighter. less weight on a Boeing 737-800 means that 0.5% less fuel will be burned. Delta Air Lines got the first 737NG with these brakes. The plane was a 737-700.
On August 21, 2006, Sky News said that some 737NGs had faulty parts. The report said that Boeing had found some parts of the plane to be faulty, but they did not fix it. Boeing said that these statements were "without merit". This means that Boeing thinks Sky News is wrong. However, another show looked at 737NGs and also thought that some things were faulty.
Since 2006, Boeing has been thinking about replacing the 737 with a completely new design.
On July 20, 2011, Boeing said it would make a new version of the 737. It would have the CFM International LEAP-X engine.American Airlines said it would order 100 of these planes. The plane will probably be finished in 2016 or 2017.
On August 30, 2011, Boeing said it would definitely make this new plane. They called it the Boeing 737 MAX. The CFM International LEAP-1B engines that it will use burns 16% less fuel than the Airbus A320. The 737 MAX's main rival will be the Airbus A320neo family.
The 737-600 replaces the 737-500. Its main rival is the Airbus A318. 69 737-600s have been made.
As of 2012, Boeing has taken the 737-600 out of its list of prices. This might mean that the 737-600 is not being made anymore.
The 737-700 replaces the 737-300. It began being used in 1998. Its main rival is the Airbus A319. Southwest Airlines has the most 737-700s. They have more than 400 of them.
The "737-700C" is a version where the seats can be taken out to carry cargo instead. There is a big door on the left of the aircraft. The United States Navy got the first 737-700C. The Navy planes are called the C-40 Clipper.
The "737-700ER" ("ER" means "extended range") came out on January 31, 2006. It can fly for . The 737-700ER's main rival is the Airbus A319LR.
The 737-800 is a longer version of the 737-700. It replaces the 737-400. For many airlines in the United States, the 737-800 replaced Boeing 727-200s.
The 737-800 is one of the planes which replaces the McDonnell Douglas MD-80. It burns of fuel every hour. That is about 80% less fuel than an MD-80.
On August 14, 2008, American Airlines said it was ordering 26 737-800s. 2,135 -800s have been delivered.
The 737-800's main rival is the Airbus A320.
The 737-900 is the longest 737 ever made. Alaska Airlines got the first -900 on May 15, 2001. The 737-900 has the same MTOW as the −800. It also does not carry any more fuel. The 737-900 can carry more luggage but cannot fly as far. This meant that it could not be a rival to the Airbus A321.
The "737-900ER" ("ER" for "extended range") is the newest Boeing 737. It was made to replace the 757-200. It was also made to be a rival to the Airbus A321.
The 737-900ER can carry more fuel than other 737s. It also has winglets.
The first 737-900ER was finished on August 8, 2006. Lion Air got the first 737-900ER on April 27, 2007. Lion Air has ordered 166 737-900ERs as of August 2011.
On August 22, 2011, it was said that Delta Air Lines ordered 100 737-900ERs. That is the biggest single order for this type of 737.
As of July 2010, 3,119 Boeing 737 Next Generation planes are being used by airlines. There are 62 -600s, 1,019 -700s, 1,915 -800s and 123 -900s.
The Boeing 737 Next Generation series has been involved in 8 hull-loss accidents and 7 hijackings. people have died in these. A hull-loss accident is an accident where the plane is damaged so much it cannot be repaired, or if it is completely destroyed.The most notable accidents are shown here.

The Mann Ranges are mountain ranges in central Australia. They are in the far northwest of South Australia, with a small section running over the border into the Northern Territory. Tha ranges are part of the geological region known as the Musgrave Block, which also includes the Petermann and Musgrave Ranges. Mountains in this region were formed in the Petermann Orogeny (600–550 million years ago).
This area is part of the traditional country of the Pitjantjatjara nation. They associate it with spiritual stories about Wati Ngiṉṯaka (the perentie lizard man), a creation spirit from the Dreamtime. He is said to have created the landforms while travelling through the area during the Dreamtime. His route forms a network of songlines that are spiritually important to native people. The largest communities in the area are Kaṉpi and Nyapaṟi.
The first European person to visit the area was William Gosse in 1873. With the help of local Aboriginal people, Gosse and his team explored the Mann Ranges after seeing the range from the top of Uluṟu. From the Mann Ranges, he went west to the Tomkinson Ranges, but turned back rather than trying to cross the Great Victoria Desert. He came back to the Mann Ranges and then went eastward to the Musgrave Ranges.

<doc id="390195" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=390195" title="Boeing 737 MAX">
Boeing 737 MAX

The Boeing 737 MAX is a new family of Boeing 737. It is being designed by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. This family will replace the Boeing 737 Next Generation family. It will be the fourth family of 737. The biggest change is the engines. The 737 MAX will have new, better CFM International LEAP-1B engines. The outside of the plane will also get some changes. The very first 737 MAX will probably be delivered in 2017, which is 50 years after the first Boeing 737 took off. Boeing has 1,285 orders for the 737 MAX as of May 14, 2013.
Since 2006, Boeing has been thinking about replacing the 737 with a completely new design.
In 2010, Airbus said it was making the Airbus A320neo family, which is an improved version of the Airbus A320 family. Airlines started ordering a lot of A320neos. AirAsia and IndiGo are examples. This made Boeing's managers allow the 737 MAX to be developed on August 30, 2011. Boeing said that the 737 MAX will use 16% less fuel than the Airbus A320 and 4% less than the Airbus A320neo. Boeing thinks the 737 MAX will be able to fly farther than Airbus A320neo. The first 737 MAX aircraft is supposed to be delivered in 2017.
The 737 MAX only has three types. They are the 737 MAX 7, 737 MAX 8 and 737 MAX 9. The 737 MAX 7 will replace the 737-700, the 737 MAX 8 will replace the 737-800 and the 737 MAX 9 will replace the 737-900ER. The -700, -800 and -900ER sold the most out of the 737 Next Generation family.
At first, Boeing would not say which airlines had ordered 737 MAX planes (except American Airlines). On November 17, 2011, Boeing said that nine airlines had ordered 700 planes. On December 13, 2011, Southwest Airlines said they had ordered 150 aircraft. In December 2011, Boeing had 948 orders from 13 airlines.
In January 2012, Norwegian Air Shuttle said it had ordered 100 Boeing 737 MAX planes. This is the first 737 MAX order from Europe. In July 2012, Virgin Australia said it would buy 23 MAX aircraft. Later that month, Air Lease Corporation (ALC) said it would buy 75 MAX aircraft. On July 12, 2012 United Airlines said it would order 100 Boeing 737 MAX 9 and 50 737-900ER aircraft. This entire order costs $14.8 billion.
In late July 2012, Aeromexico said it would buy 90 737 MAX 8 aircraft. In August 2012, Silk Air said it would order 31 737 MAX 8 and 23 737-800 aircraft. In September 2012, Avolon said it had ordered 10 737 MAX 8s, 5 737 MAX 9s and 10 737-800s.
On October 1, 2012, Gol Transportes Aéreos said it has ordered 60 737 MAX 8s. On October 3, GECAS ordered 75 737 MAX 8s and 10 737-800s. On the same day, 22 Boeing 737 MAX 8s were ordered. The airline who ordered these planes is not known. On October 11, 2012, Alaska Airlines ordered 50 Boeing 737s, 20 737 MAX 8, 17 737 MAX 9, and 13 Boeing 737-900ERs.
On November 4, 2012, ALAFCO ordered 20 Boeing 737 MAX 8s. On November 5, 2012, Aeromexico bought 90 Boeing 737 MAX 8s and 9s.
On December 6, 2012, Icelandair bought 12 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft (8 MAX 8s, and 4 MAX 9s).
On January 2, 2013, Aviation Capital Group (ACG) bought 60 737 MAX aircraft. 50 of them are the MAX 8. 10 are the MAX 9. This order has the 1,000th order in it.
On February 7, 2013, American Airlines said it would definitely buy 100 Boeing 737 MAX 8s. On February 13, 2012, Icelandair made its order bigger. They have now bought 16 aircraft (9 Boeing 737 MAX 8s, and 7 Boeing 737 MAX 9s).
On May 14, 2013, Turkish Airlines ordered 50 737 MAX aircraft (40 MAX 8s, 10 MAX 9s).
Boeing spent a lot of 2011 looking at two different diameters of CFM International LEAP-1B engine: or . Both of these would mean that Boeing would have to make some changes to the wheels, because the engines need to be above the ground. Boeing said the bigger engine would use less fuel. However, because it is bigger, it would make more drag and be heavier. This would mean that even more changes would be needed.
Both engines are bigger than the CFM56-7B engines on the Boeing 737 Next Generation. The new engine will use 10–12% less fuel than the engines on the 737NG. It has been said that Boeing are looking at parts of the plane that can be changed to make less drag and burn less fuel.
In November 2011, Boeing said it would use the diameter engine. The landing gear will need to be made longer by 6–8 inches (15–20 cm). This is to make sure the engines stay above the ground. Boeing will probably say exactly what the 737 MAX looks like sometime in 2013. On May 17, 2012, Boeing said the engine's diameter had been made bigger. This means it is now 69.4 inches (176 cm).
The 737 MAX will have the Boeing Sky Interior. The Boeing Sky Interior is like the cabin of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The 737 MAX will also have winglets.
The winglets used on the 737 MAX will be different to the winglets on the 737NG. Boeing says the new winglets will help the plane use 1.5% less fuel.
Boeing does not want to change the cockpit because they want it to be similar to the cockpit on the 737NG. Boeing also wants to add some more fly-by-wire to the 737 MAX. However, Boeing said that changes will be "very minimal".

An airliner is a type of transportation service for transporting passengers and air cargo. Such aircraft are most often operated by airlines. The largest airliners are called "wide-body aircraft". These aircraft are frequently called "twin-aisle aircraft" because they generally have two separate aisles running from the front to the back of the passenger cabin. These aircraft are usually used for long-haul flights between airline hubs and major cities with many passengers. A smaller, more common class of airliners is the "narrow-body aircraft" or "single aisle" aircraft. These smaller airliners are generally used for short to medium-distance flights with fewer passengers than their wide-body counterparts.

The Spokesman-Review

The Spokesman Review Is a newspaper based in Spokane, Washington, in the United States. It is a broadsheet newspaper, meaning it is a lot longer than it is wide. A new one is written every day. It is Spokane's only daily newspaper.
"The Spokesman-Review" was started when two old newspapers merged (meaning they joined together to make one). Those newspapers were called "Spokane Falls Review" and "Spokesman", and they were merged in 1893. The first newspaper to be printed as "The Spokesman-Review" happened in June 29, 1894. It used to published three different newspapers each day: one for Spokane, one for Spokane Valley, and one for Northern Idaho. However, downsizing in 2007 caused "The Spokesman-Review" to only print one paper a day from then on.
"The Spokesman-Review" is thought to lean Liberal, especially when it involves opinions on city hall and hate-groups in the Eastern Washington-Northern Idaho area. Those hate groups didn't like that. In 1997, three far right militants were convicted of bombing the Spokane Valley office of "The Spokesman-Review".
"The Spokesman-Review" is owned by Cowles Publishing Company. Cowles also owns KHQ-TV, a news station in Spokane. This makes "The Spokesman-Review" one of only a few family-owned newspapers in the United States. However, Cowles gets criticized for allegedly using its many news outlets to affect public opinion, and this makes "The Spokesman-Review" criticized for the same reasons. Once, something called "the River Park Square garage issue" occurred, in which Cowles could have made $20 million for affecting public opinion. An independent review by the Washington News Council showed that "The Spokesman-Review" did have bias on the issue.
"The Spokesman-Review" is Washington State's third most read newspaper. Only the Seattle Times in Seattle and the News-Tribune in Tacoma are read by more people.

Because of growth of population and constant growing of developed countries bed bug bites cases have been rising a lot in 1980s–1990s. The reason behind it is unclear - most point that it is caused by increase in international travelling, increase in second hand furniture market and growing immunity to anti bed bug sprays. Bed bugs have been known to human for thousands years.

Very Large Telescope

The Very Large Telescope (VLT) is a telescope operated by the European Southern Observatory. It is on Cerro Paranal in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile.
The VLT consists of four separate telescopes, each with a main mirror 8.2m across. They are often used separately, but they can be used together to get a very high angular resolution. The observatory also has four movable Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs) of 1.8 m aperture.
The VLT operates at visible and infrared wavelengths. Each individual telescope can detect objects roughly four billion times fainter than can be seen with the naked eye. When all the telescopes are combined, the facility can achieve an angular resolution of about 0.001 arc-second. This is equivalent to roughly two metres at the distance of the Moon.
The VLT is the most productive ground-based facility for astronomy: only the Hubble Space Telescope leads to more scientific papers in observational astronomy.
Among the pioneering observations carried out using the VLT are the first direct image of an exoplanet, the tracking of individual stars moving around the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, and observations of the afterglow of the furthest known gamma-ray burst.
The four smaller 1.8-metre ATs are available and dedicated to interferometry. This allows the VLT to operate every night on visible and infrared wavelengths.

Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (U.S. game show)

Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (sometimes called Millionaire) is an American quiz show based on the British show of the same name. One can win up to one million United States dollars ($1,000,000) on the show for answering fourteen (or fifteen in older versions) multiple choice trivia questions in a row. 
The first version of the show was hosted by Regis Philbin and it aired on primetime on ABC. It aired from August 16, 1999 to June 27, 2002. The current syndicated version started airing on September 16, 2002. Meredith Vieira hosted it for eleven seasons, leaving to work on other projects. Cedric the Entertainer was signed up to be the next host, and episodes with Cedric started in September 2013. Cedric announced on April 30, 2014 that he would not return for a second season because of his busy schedule.
The format of the show has changed several times since the show has been on the air. The original format featured fifteen multiple choice questions that got harder as a player continued, and the money amounts got higher. Starting in 2008, the show started using a clock and contestants were timed. If time ran out, they were forced to walk away with the last prize amount they won. The format changed again in 2010 where the first ten questions had random money amounts and difficulty. The second round is then similar to the older Millionaire shows. There are only fourteen questions in this version.

Viverridae

The Viverridae is a family of small to medium-sized mammals, the viverrids. They are in the Feliformia, the cat-like carnivores.
The family is made up of 15 genera and 33 species. It was named by John Edward Gray in 1821. They are found all over the Oriental region, all over Africa and into southern Europe. 
As they live in Madagascar and Celebes, this shows they also lived in the tropics of the Old World, and beyond it, over Wallace's line.
Viverrids mostly live in tropical rainforest. They also live in woodland, savanna and mountains.
Many viverrids are civet cats, such as the genera "Vivera", "Civettictis" and "Viverricula". The term refers to their noticeable and (to us) unpleasant scent. It is sometimes used for other cats which happen to be rather smelly.
Vivverrids of the genus "Genetta" are known as 'genets', and there is another genus, "Poiana", which are called 'linsangs'. The genet "Genetta genetta" is the only viverid to live in Europe. It is the striped-tail one at top right in the illustration above.
Viverrids are the most basal ('primitive') of all the families of cat-like animals and less specialized than the Felidae. Their skeletons are similar to those of fossils dating back to the Eocene, up to 50 million years ago.
In external characters, they are distinguished from the Felidae by the hind foot being five-toed and typically by the longer muzzle and shorter limbs. The skull differs as does the dental formula. They have anal glands which may secrete a strong odour. Many species have striped tails.
Viverrids, though in the order Carnivora, are mostly omnivorous. The species popularly called "palm civets" are entirely herbivorous.

Tjunti is a soakage site near Kaḻṯukatjara, in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is where the Hull River cuts through the Petermann Ranges. It is about to the southeast of Kaḻṯukatjara (41 km by road, along the Tjukaruru Road). Tjunti is the site where the famous gold prospector Harold B. Lasseter took refuge on his fatal search for Lasseter's Reef. An outstation was established here in 1977, and belongs to a Pitjantjatjara family.
The gap in the mountains is formed here by the Hull River, a sandy creek that is usually dry. It splits the Curdie Range in the south from the Mannanana Range in the north. There are several soaks and rockholes in the area.
The small cave where Lasseter took refuge is (now commonly called Lasseter's Cave in English). This is an opening in a rock formation in the Mannanana Range (). Lasseter took shelter here for about 25 days during January 1931. He was trying to find a rich gold deposit that he claimed to have discovered in the area on an earlier expedition. His camels ran away, and he was stranded in the desert without food. While taking shelter in the cave, Lasseter wrote about his journey in his diary. He was later found by a local Pitjantjatjara family, who gave him food and water. After this, Lasseter decided to leave the cave and tried to walk the 140 km to Kata Tjuṯa. He was weak from dehydration, malnutrition and exhaustion, and he died three days later, after walking about 55 km.

Royal Palace, Oslo

The Royal Palace (, or ) in Oslo, Norway is the official home of the present Norwegian monarch. It was built in the early 19th century as the Norwegian home of King Charles III. He was King of Sweden as well as Norway. The palace has 173 rooms.
Before the Royal Palace was built, Norwegian royalty lived in "Paleet". It was a very nice town house in Christiania. Paleet was given to the government of Norway by a rich merchant named Bernt Anker in 1805. During the last years of the union with Denmark, it was used by the viceroys of Norway. In 1814, the first king of independent Norway, Christian Frederick used it as his home. 
King Charles III John picked the site for the Royal Palace on the western side of Christiania in 1821. He had the inexperienced Dutch-born architect Linstow design the building. The Parliament approved the cost of 150 000 Speciedaler. Work on the site started in 1824. On 1 October 1825, the king laid down the foundation stone beneath the altar of the future Royal chapel. 
The cost of the foundation works caused the building to cost more than expected. They had to stop construction in 1827. It was started again in 1833. During this time, the Storting would not approve more money for the construction. They did this because they did not like that the king was trying to create closer ties between Norway and Sweden. In 1833, Linstow changed his plans to reduce the cost. Improved relations with the king made the Storting approve the money to finish the construction. The roof was put on in 1836. The inside of the building was finished during the late 1840s. King Charles John, who died in 1844, never lived in his palace. The first people to live in the palace were his son Oscar I and his queen Josephine.

In 1925, the US Post Office asked for a mail plane to replace the DH-4s that it was using then. The new plane would need to use the same engine as the DH-4. A lot of these could be bought. The Boeing Model 40 could carry up to of mail. The mail was stored in two places at the front of the plane. The wings were made of wood. The Model 40 had landing gear that did not move.
The Model 40 flew for the first time on July 7, 1925. The US Post Office bought the prototype of the Model 40, but it decided to use the Douglas M-2 instead.
Later, Boeing made the Model 40A. The Model 40A had a new engine, which was lighter than the old one. A cabin was also made, which could carry passengers. of mail. The US Post Office let Boeing carry mail from San Francisco to Chicago in January 1927. Boeing built 24 Model 40As to do this.
The next type of Model 40 was the Model 40C. It had a bigger cabin so that four passengers could be carried. Model 40As had their engines changed to even lighter ones. Model 40As with this new engine were called the Model 40B-2. The Model 40B-4 was another model which had the cabin of the Model 40C and the engine of the Model 40B-2. Boeing Model 40s were made until February 1932.
Boeing made its own airline, which was called "Boeing Air Transport". It started flying from San Francisco to Chicago on July 1, 1927.
As of February 17, 2008, a Model 40 called Boeing 40C S/N 1043 is the only Model 40 which can still fly. It is the oldest Boeing plane which can still fly. In 1928, the aircraft was damaged after a crash. It was rebuilt by Pemberton and Sons Aviation in Spokane, Washington.

"PaRappa the Rapper" is a music game in which the main character, PaRappa, must make his way through each of the game's six stages by rapping. On each stage, the game alternates with the rapping teacher to PaRappa. There is a U 'RAPPING meter in the bottom right corner, which will show the player's performance with four levels, from top to bottom: "Cool", "Good", "Bad", and "Awful". The game works by a pattern of buttons (Triangle, Circle, Square, X, L, and R) PaRappa will have to copy. The teacher will set down a pattern and PaRappa will have to copy it. Players will stay on the "Good" ranking when staying to the beat. If he messes up two times in a row, he goes down a level. On the other hand, if he gets a pattern right, he moves up a level, with Good at the maximum. The player must clear the level on Good or Cool. If he clears it on Bad or Awful, or the meter goes below Awful during the game, he will have to try the level again. However, if the meter gets to Cool, the teacher will leave and PaRappa will be able to free-style. This is achieved by freestyling in a manner different to the predetermined lyric. If all of the levels are cleared with the meter on Cool, a bonus level, "K.T and the Sunny Funny Band", will be unlocked. However, the player must complete the game at least once before "Cool" can be reached.
The player takes on the role of Parappa, a paper-thin rapping dog, who is trying to win the heart of a flower-like girl named Sunny Funny. However, he is intimidated by the presence of Joe Chin, a rich, narcissistic dog who goes overboard with his attempts to impress Sunny.
The game starts with a movie, "Jet Baby", being watched by the four main characters, PaRappa, Sunny, Katy Kat (a blue cat), and P.J Berri (a bear). When it's finished, they go to Chunky Burger, a restaurant. Somewhere after that, two bullies come up and pick on them, but they are stopped by Joe Chin. However, he ends up chatting about his adventures, which take too long, and Sunny, P.J, and Katy leave. PaRappa thinks he should be a hero to impress Sunny, and decides to drop off at a kung-fu dojo, learning to fight with help from an onion, Chop Chop Master Onion. After that, they are at a plaza. PaRappa asks they should go down to a beach, but the others note they need a license and a car to do that. Joe Chin, once again, arrives and shows them his new car, the Super Stretched Limo 900. They all like it, until Joe Chin thinks Katy and Sunny should be with him at the front, and PaRappa and PJ all the way at the back. Both are far from amused. PaRappa then thinks if he had a car and license, he could take Sunny anywhere, and decides to drop off at a driver's education course to get his license, with help from a moose, Instructor Mooselini. After he gets his license, he still needs a car, and borrow's his dad's. He invites the others on. "You know, this is really a lot of fun. Wouldn't it be nice if we could so somewhere far far away?" Sunny's words echo in PaRappa's mind, and he doesn't pay attention to driving and instead thinks of him and Sunny on a date, but when their car crashes into a truck, and breaks into pieces, PaRappa has to go to a flea market owned by a frog, Prince Fleaswallow, to earn money to fix his car. Then, the day before Sunny's birthday arrives and PaRappa is assigned the job of getting a cake. However, he is knocked into the cake he spends his money on by Joe Chin, who plans to win over PaRappa with his tall 42 story high cake. Since he is almost out of money, he needs to make a cake himself, following instructions from a cooking show by a chicken, "Cheap Cheap Chicken". The day comes, and his cake is a success. Katy gets an idea to leave PaRappa and Sunny alone, so she and PJ leave. Later, they watch the sunset together. Unfortunately, this goes wrong when PaRappa has a sudden urge to use the bathroom after eating most of the cake later that day. Sunny, on the other hand however, confuses him for "looking real manly today" instead of needing to go to the backroom. They decide to go home, but PaRappa, of course, stops at the restroom and sees his previous mentors, having to out-rap all of them to reach the only toilet in the restroom. Then, one night, he is invited to Club Fun, and asks Sunny to go with him, to which she agrees. After they arrive, PaRappa gets on stage with a spider, MC King Kong Mushi, then raps solo at the end of the song to express his true feelings for Sunny. Then the game ends when they all decide to see another movie.
The characters are 2D to preserve Rodney's unique style of artwork, who designed all of the characters. He was asked to help design the game from an interview by Masaya. Like in the "Paper Mario" series by Nintendo, all of the characters appear to be flat, two dimensional beings cut from paper while the surroundings are primarily three dimensional. The setting is a bright urban city; with its inhabitants ranging from animals (chickens, dogs, frogs, and cats), inanimate objects (onions, flowers, hammers), and some humans.
The game spawned a merchandising campaign in Japan, a spinoff in 1999, an anime series in 2001, and a direct sequel for the PlayStation 2 in 2002. PaRappa is a playable character in "PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale". There is another similar game by Masaya, "Vib Ribbon".

'Would it not be gross ignorance, my daughters, if, when a man was questioned about his name, or country, or parents, he could not answer?

Shapley Supercluster

The Shapley Supercluster or Shapley Concentration (SCl 124) is the largest concentration of galaxies in our nearby universe. 
It is a gravitationally interacting unit 650 million light years away (z=0.046). This means it pulls itself together, instead of expanding with the universe. It is an overdensity in the distribution of galaxies in the constellation of Centaurus. 
In the late 1920s, Harlow Shapley and his colleagues at the Harvard College Observatory started a survey of galaxies in the southern sky, using photographic plates obtained at the 24-inch Bruce telescope at Bloemfontein, South Africa. He found a 'cloud' in the constellation of Centaurus to be the most striking concentration of galaxies.
In recent times, the Shapley Supercluster was rediscovered, in a survey of galaxies of galaxies at the University of Cambridge in England. In this paper, the supercluster was named after Shapley, in recognition of his pioneering survey of galaxies in which this concentration of galaxies was first seen. Around the same time, others had noticed a remarkable concentration of clusters in the Abell catalogue of galaxy clusters: they had named it the "Alpha concentration".

<doc id="390779" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=390779" title="Outstation">
Outstation

In Australia, an outstation is a small, rural settlement of Aboriginal Australians. They are usually built on or near the community's traditional country; the outstations are therefore also called homelands. The people living on an outstation are usually closely related, belonging to one or two families. The people will have a spiritual and ancestral relationship with the land. The number of people living in the settlement may rise and fall throughout the year, depending on events (such as deaths and ceremonies), but the permanent population is normally less than a few dozen. The definition of an outstation will vary greatly depending on the region, cultural group, history and state property laws. They are generally classed as residential areas on Aboriginal-owned land. They are often located near sites that are culturally important. The average outstation consists of little more than one or more houses and a source of water. They are usually very basic, and constructed entirely by the people living there. Most of these communities are located in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland.
In statistical data, outstations are called "discrete indigenous communities". There are more than a thousand such communities in Australia. They are largely self-governing.
Historically, the word "outstation" referred to a dwelling or shelter on sheep or cattle stations. Such shelters were built on stations that were large enough to have more than a day's travel (by horseback) between different parts of the property. They contained beds and food for stockmen.
During the 1970s and 1980s, a large number of Aboriginal people moved away from the towns and missions in which they had been settled years before. They returned with their families to the areas where they grew up, and set up camps or homes there. This became known as the outstation movement. For most people, it was an attempt at returning to the traditional way of life and getting back their autonomy and self-sufficiency. This movement developed after the Australian government had decided to give welfare benefits to indigenous people. It had also started policies encouraging self-determination and self-management for indigenous communities. This was the opposite of what the government had previously planned for indigenous Australians (cultural assimilation).
In October 1976, a report by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs estimated that there were more than 100 outstation communities. Most of them were located in the Northern Territory. In Arnhem Land, there were about 55 outstations by the end of 1976, with an average size of about 30 people. About 30 more were located in the southwest of the Northern Territory, ranging in size from 15 to 100 people. The Northern Territory had early success in the outstation movemnet, because the Aboriginal Land Rights Act was passed in the territory in 1976. This was the first Aboriginal land rights law in the country.
There are now more than a thousand outstation communities in Australia. There are about 500 in the Northern Territory, and around one-third of Aboriginal people in the Territory live on outstations.
Several studies have shown that people living on outstations are much healthier than other Aboriginal people.

Thalassaemia

Thalassaemia (or thalassemia) is a genetic disorder of the blood which originated in the Mediterranean region. 
This disease is caused by the weakening and destruction of red blood cells. This is caused by mutant genes which affect how the body makes haemoglobin. Haemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells which carries oxygen. People with thalassaemia make less haemoglobin and fewer circulating red blood cells than normal, which results in mild or severe anemia.
Thalassaemia can cause significant complications, including pneumonia, iron overload, bone deformities and cardiovascular illness. However, this inherited disease of red blood cells gives a degree of protection against malaria, which is or was common in the regions where the trait is common. This selective survival advantage for carriers (known as heterozygous advantage) is responsible for keeping the mutation in populations way above its mutation rate. Carriers are heterozygous for the thalassaemia allele, meaning only one of their two alleles is mutant (abnormal). There are a number of different versiona of thalassaemia. Each one is caused by a mutation in a different position in the genome.
In that respect, thalassaemia resembles another genetic disorder affecting haemoglobin, sickle-cell disease.
It is possible to cure patients with thalassaemia with bone marrow transplants from compatible donors. However, this method requires an HLA-matched compatible donor.

Cepheid variable

Cepheids are a type of very luminous variable stars. There is a strong direct relationship between a Cepheid's luminosity and pulsation period. This makes Cepheids important standard candles for the galactic and extragalactic distance scales.
Cepheid variables are divided into several subclasses which exhibit clearly different masses, ages, and evolutionary histories: 
The first cepheid known was Delta Cephei in the constellation Cepheus, found by John Goodricke in 1784. Delta Cephei is of great importance because its distance is extremely well known, thanks in part to it being in a star cluster, and the precise Hubble Space Telescope/Hipparcos parallaxes.
Classical Cepheids (also known as Population I Cepheids, Type I Cepheids, or Delta Cephei variables) pulsate with very regular periods of the order of days to months. Classical Cepheids are population I variable stars which are 4–20 times more massive than the Sun, and up to 100,000 times more luminous. Cepheids are yellow supergiants of spectral class F6 – K2. When they pulsate, their radii change by ~25%. For the longer-period I Carinae this means millions of kilometers for a pulsation cycle.
Type II Cepheids (also termed Population II Cepheids) are population II variable stars which pulsate with periods between 1 and 50 days. Type II Cepheids are typically metal-poor, old (~10 giga years), low mass objects (~half the mass of the Sun). Type II Cepheids are divided into several subgroups by period.
Type II Cepheids are used to fix the distance to the galactic center of the Milky Way, globular clusters, and galaxies.

The Boeing 80, sometimes called the Boeing Model 80 or just the Model 80, was an American airliner. It was a biplane with three engines. The Boeing 80 was built by the Boeing Airplane Company. It could carry mail and passengers.
Boeing Air Transport was started on February 17, 1927 by William Boeing. On July 1, 1927, planes from Boeing Air Transport started flying mail from San Francisco to Chicago. At first, the Boeing Model 40A was used for this.
Boeing decided to make a plane to carry passengers. In 1928 it designed the Model 80. The Boeing 80 could carry 12 people. The pilots sat in a cockpit in front of the passengers. 
The first Boeing 80 took off on July 27, 1928. Three more Boeing 80s were made before Boeing started to make the Boeing 80A. The Boeing 80A was longer and it could carry 18 people. It also had better engines. It first took off on July 18, 1929. 
The Boeing 80 first flew for Boeing Air Transport on September 20, 1928. It soon turned out to be successful. The Boeing 80A started being used in September 1929.
In May 1930, Boeing Air Transport hired eight female flight attendants. They first flew on May 15. The Boeing 80 and 80A were used until the Boeing 247 replaced them in 1934.
One Boeing 80A was found in a dump at Anchorage Airport in 1960. It was fixed up and it is now in the Museum of Flight in Seattle.

The Boeing Model 200 Monomail was an American mail plane. It was built in the 1930s by Boeing. It flew for the first time on 6 May 1930.
The Boeing Monomail was a monoplane instead of a biplane. Its wheels could be ed. Only one plane was made for the US Army to look at. The plane eventually began to fly main from San Francisco to Chicago.
Another version was made, the Model 221. It was made longer by 8 inches. This meant it could carry passengers, but less cargo. This version first flew on 18 August 1930. 
There were no good engines for the Boeing Monomail to use. By the time good engines could be used, new planes had been made which were better than the Monomail. One of these was the Boeing 247.

Gill Pinnacle (or Gill's Pinnacle) is an inselberg in the far east of Western Australia, on the Ngaanyatjarra Lands. It is part of the Petermann Ranges. It consists of a dome-shaped hill, surrounded by dense mulga; its top is bare rock. The hill has been useful as a landmark, because it marks the location of one of the area's most reliable freshwater rockholes, Gordon's Springs. This is a few hundred metres to the north of the rock. The area is called (also spelled ' or ') in Pitjantjatjara and Ngaanyatjarra.
The first European people to visit the area were the explorers Ernest Giles and W. H. Tietkens, in 1874. They saw the rock from Weld Pass, which is further to the west. Giles named the rock after his brother-in-law. He named the waterhole, Gordon's Springs, after his nephew.

Giant star

A giant star is a star with much larger radius and luminosity than a main-sequence star of the same surface temperature.
Giant stars are up to a few hundred times the diameter of the Sun and between 10 and a few thousand times brighter than the Sun. They don't last as long as most main sequence stars. Stars still more luminous than giants are referred to as supergiants and hypergiants.
A hot, luminous main-sequence star may also be referred to as a giant.
There are a wide range of giant class stars, and sub-divisions are often used to identify particular types. Astronomers use such terms as: sub-giants, bright giants, red giants, yellow giants and blue giants.

Aggregate fruit

An aggregate fruit is a fruit that develops from a single flower, but the flower has more than one ovary, and the ovaries join together as the fruit grows.
A fruit that grows from just one flower that contains just one ovary, is not an aggregate fruit but a simple fruit.
Not all flowers with multiple ovaries grow into aggregate fruit; the ovaries of some flowers do not become tightly joined together to make a larger fruit.
Aggregate fruits may also be accessory fruits. In accessory fruits, parts of the flower that are not the ovary become juicy and form part of the fruit.
Aggregate fruits include:

Sylvanian Families

Sylvanians were origanally set in Japan in the 1950's most of the families are rural middle-class with many luxuries and local buisnesses. They have many leisure activities such as horse riding, rowing and hosting garden parties. The simple caravan means that they can enjoy short stays on holiday. This means that they can be away from their house whether it is a small cottage or a multi-storey town house.
In 1985 sylvanian families were launched in both Japan and North America. They were such a success that in 1987 they moved over the Atlantic to Western Europe and to the UK. By 1988 these small toys were a major success world wide, they went on to win London toy of the year award 3 times in a row this had never been achieved before or after. They were so popular that in the late 80's an animated TV series was made, this was greatly watched and spain and the UK. In the 90's it was aired on American TV.
By the mid 90's sylvanian families, despite their major success, had gone out of business in the UK. The production company Tomy lost the rights to sylvanian families and American Calico Critters. In the late 90's another company, Flair, took over sylvanian families and reintroduced them into the UK. It was in 2007 that they celebrated their 20th birthday a special edition dalmation family(that had not been sold since they went out of production) with red party hats saying 'happy birthday'. 2012 was the 25th birthday and they sold a celebration rabbit family in honour a birthday that they never have seen if it hadn't have been for Flair.

<doc id="390902" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=390902" title="Boeing 247">
Boeing 247

The Boeing 247, sometimes called the Boeing Model 247 was an American airliner. It is thought to be the first airliner to fully use advanced things like able landing gear, an autopilot and deicing boots. 
The Boeing 247 first flew on February 8, 1933. It started being used later that year. Later, planes became bigger and some had four engines. However, no big changes were made until Boeing made the Boeing 307 Stratoliner.
The Boeing 247 was an advanced plane. The design was taken from the Boeing Monomail (Models 200, 221, 221A) and the B-9 bomber. The Boeing 247 was faster than the Boeing P-12, which was the main American fighter at the time. The P-12 was did not have a roof on the cockpit, and it was a biplane. The Boeing 247 landed at just 62 mph. This meant that flaps were not needed. At just 10 mph, the back wheel came off the ground, which made it easier to steer.
Also, the 247 was the first airliner with two engines which could fly on just one engine. The Boeing 247 had special propellers. It could fly at 11,500 ft at full weight. The Douglas DC-1 and some other airliners before World War II used parts of the Boeing 247's design. The 247 was supposed to carry 14 passengers and have Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet engines, but the plane was made smaller and got different engines. 
The pilots did not think that the plane, which weighed eight tons, could land on any runway back then. They also did not like the Hornet engines. This was because most pilots were used to Wasps. It was thought that they would find Hornets too powerful. Pratt & Whitney's chief engineer, George Mead, knew that the pilots were wrong. P&W's head, Frederick Rentschler, decided to do what the pilots wanted. This made an argument between Mead and Rentschler. 
Even though there were some arguments about the design and engines, the 247 was still a very good design. Boeing showed it at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair.
Boeing wanted to make the plane as safe as possible. They made the plane strong and put in things to make passengers more comfortable. For example, the cabin had air conditioning. It was also sound-proof. The plane had a pilot, co-pilot and a flight attendant. The wheels did not fully go into the plane. A part of the wheels hung down below the plane. This was done to make it safer for the plane to land if the landing gear could not be put down. The wheel at the back of the plane could not be moved.
In 1934, Boeing put a Boeing 247 into the MacRobertson Race. In the race, planes raced from England to Australia. The pilots of the Boeing plane were Col.Roscoe Turner and Clyde Pangborn. The 247 was basically a normal plane, but some parts were taken out to make space for more fuel tanks. Many different planes from all over the world took part. Turner and Pangborn came in second place. The Douglas DC-2 came first.
The Boeing 247 won the 1934 US Collier Trophy for "excellence in aviation design".
The 247 could go across the United States eight hours faster than any plane which came before it. The Boeing 247 started being used on May 22, 1933. One set a record of 19½ hours when it flew from San Francisco to New York. 
The first 60 247s were sold to Boeing Air Transport (part of the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, UATC). They cost $65,000 each. TWA (Transcontinental & Western Air) also ordered the 247 but UATC said no. TWA President Jack Frye asked for a new airliner. He paid Don Douglas to design and build the Douglas DC-1 prototype. Douglas eventually made the DC-3 line.
The Boeing 247 was shown to have some serious problems with its design. Air carriers did not like the fact that it only carried 10 passengers. The DC-2 and later DC-3 could carry many more passengers. This meant that the Boeing 247 would not earn airlines as much money. 
Seventy-five 247s were built. Douglas got 800 orders for DC-3s from airlines before the Pearl Harbor attack. Douglas made over 10,000 DC-3s.
Many of United's Boeing 247s were bought by Western Air Express. It was said that they were bought at a very low price.
The 247 was used until World War II. The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) had seven 247s to move soldiers around. Some 247s were still flying in the late 1960s. These were either cargo planes or personal planes. 
October 10, 1933 – A United Air Lines 247 was blown up by a bomb.
November 9, 1933 - A United Air Lines 247 crashed after it took off. Four of the nine people on the plane died.
December 20, 1934 - United Air Lines Flight 6, a 247, crashed near Western Springs, Illinois. Nobody died. The plane was fixed and started flying again.
October 7, 1935 – United Air Lines Trip 4, a 247D, crashed 10 miles to the west of Cheyenne, Wyoming. It is not known why it crashed. Everybody on the plane died.
October 30, 1935 - A United Air Lines Boeing 247D crashed near Cheyenne. Everyone on board died.
December 15, 1936 – Seven people died when Western Air Express Flight 6, a 247D, crashed on Lone Peak in Utah. 
December 27, 1936 - United Air Lines Trip 34, a 247D, crashed in Los Angeles County, California. All 12 people on board died.
January 12, 1937 – Western Air Express Flight 7, a 247, crashed into a mountain in Newhall, California. Five people died.

<doc id="390944" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=390944" title="Boeing 307">
Boeing 307

The Boeing Model 307 Stratoliner was an airliner which was made by Boeing. It was the first airliner to have a pressurized cabin. This meant that the Boeing 307 could fly at 20,000 ft (6,000 m), which is above most weather. If the plane was at 14,700 ft (4,480 m), it would be like 8,000 ft (2,440 m) inside the cabin. The Model 307 carried five crew and 33 passengers. The cabin was nearly 12 ft (3.6 m) across. It was the first plane which took off from land to have a flight engineer.
In 1935 Boeing designed an airliner with four engines. It was based on the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. This airliner was called the Model 307. It had the same wings, tail, rudder, landing gear and engines as the B-17C. However, the middle of the plane was a circle. Its diameter was . It was designed so that the plane could be pressurized.
The first order was made in 1937 by Pan American Airways. Pan Am then ordered more. Transcontinental & Western Air (TWA) ordered five. Boeing then started making the plane.
When the U.S. joined World War II in December 1941, it was thought to be a luxury to fly. The war meant that government and military officers needed to fly long distances. Planes like Pan Am's 14 flying boats and TWA's five Boeing 307s were used for this. More fuel tanks were added to allow it to fly further. Military Boeing 307s were called C-75s. Before World War II stopped them being made, 10 307s had been made for airlines. TWA flew between New York and Los Angeles for 18 months until the Army bought their planes. TWA changed their 307s to C-75s in January 1942. These were the only American planes which could cross the Atlantic with cargo until the Douglas C-54 Skymaster was made in November 1942.
C-75s had the pressurization equipment removed to make the plane lighter. Some seats were taken off, and some other changes were made. Five fuel tanks were put onto the plane. The landing gear was made stronger and the maximum take-off weight was made bigger (from ). The outside was painted olive drab.
The first Boeing 307 Stratoliner flew from Boeing Field, Seattle on December 31, 1938. However, it crashed on March 18, 1939, while KLM was looking at it. 
The first delivery was made to Howard Hughes. He bought one Boeing 307 to fly around the world. He wanted to do it faster than he did before. Hughes' Boeing Stratoliner had more fuel tanks. It was ready to go, but then Nazi Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, so Howard Hughes did not make his flight. This 307 had its extra fuel tanks taken off. It also had more powerful engines added. It was supposed to be a "flying penthouse" for Hughes, but it was not used a lot. It was eventually sold.
Pam Am started getting its Boeing 307s in March 1940. TWA got its first 307 in April. TWA used its 307s to fly from Los Angeles to New York. Pan Am's flew from Miami to Latin America. Ten 307s were made. Three were given to Pan Am (named Clipper Flying Cloud, Clipper Comet, and Clipper Rainbow) and five to TWA (named Comanche, Cherokee, Zuni, Navajo, and Apache). One went to Howard Hughes. The first 307 crashed.
After the United States joined World War II, Pan Am kept flying its planes to Central and South America, but the Army Air Force was in charge of them. TWA's Boeing 307s were sold to the U.S. government. They were called Boeing C-75 and used by the United States Army Air Forces.
The U. S. Army gave the five C-75s back to TWA in 1944. TWA sent them back to Boeing to be rebuilt. Boeing replaced the wings and put in more powerful engines. The electrics were replaced with electrics from the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. After these changes, the 307 could carry 38 passengers. TWA switched to the Lockheed Constellation, but the 307s were used until April, 1951.
TWA sold its Stratoliners to Aigle Azur.
The C-75 flew two main routes: Washington, D.C. to Cairo and New York to Scotland. They sometimes flew from Gander, Newfoundland to Prestwick, Scotland and between Natal, Brazil and Accra, Ghana. After July 1942, they could stop to refuel at Ascension Island. I
The only Boeing 307 Stratoliner which still exists is at the Smithsonian Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. On March 28, 2002, this plane was damaged a lot when it ditched in Elliott Bay in Seattle, Washington. That was its last flight before it went to the Smithsonian. 
The main part of Howard Hughes' 307 also still exists, but it is now a house boat.

Wikivoyage started publicly in December 2006 as a German-language version that was supported by German and Swiss authors. It was owned by a German non-profit association named Wikivoyage e.V. The Italian version started in December 2007. 
In 2012, the content of Wikitravel in other languages was copied to Wikivoyage. At the same time Wikivoyage became hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), a non-profit organization that hosts other wikis such as Wikipedia. Wikivoyage was officially re-launched by Wikimedia on January 15, 2013. At that time Wikivoyage was available in German, Italian, English, French, Dutch, Russian, Swedish, Portuguese and Spanish languages. The English version is the biggest, with more than 27,400 articles in September 2016.
Wikivoyage is written by the collaboration of "Wikivoyagers" from around the world. Articles cover different levels of geography, from continents to districts of a city. Articles mostly consist of: destinations, itineraries, phrasebooks, and travel topics.
Geographical units are described in articles based on, "can you sleep there?"
The hierarchy includes:
Articles list attractions such as hotels, restaurants, bars, stores, nightclubs, tour operators, museums, statues or other works of art, city parks, town squares or streets, festivals or events, transport systems or stations, bodies of water, and uninhabited islands.
An itinerary describes a list of destinations and attractions to visit during a specific amount of time, with recommendations of how long to stay and routes to follow. Itineraries usually have a well-defined path.
A phrasebook has:
Travel topics include the following: Something that is too large or too detailed to go in a destination article. General travel information that applies to many destinations. Major events that occur in different places. Specialist information such as scuba-diving sites.

RR Lyrae

RR Lyrae is a pulsating variable star in the constellation Lyra. It is the model for the variable stars known as RR Lyrae variables. It pulses over a short cycle of 13 hours, 36 minutes. Each radial pulsation causes the radius of the star to vary between 5.1 and 5.6 times the Sun's radius.
Stars of this type are often found in globular clusters, and used as standard candles to measure distances to other galaxies.
RR Lyrae and its type are pulsating stars of spectral class A (and rarely F), with a mass of around half the Sun's. It is thought they previously shed mass and consequently, they were once stars with similar or slightly less mass than the Sun, about 0.8 solar masses. 
RR Lyrae stars pulse in a manner similar to Cepheid variables, so the mechanism for the pulsation is thought to be similar. The nature and histories of these stars is thought to be rather different.
Unlike Cepheids, RR Lyraes are old, low mass, metal-poor "Population II" stars. They are much more common than Cepheids, but also much less luminous. The average absolute magnitude of an RR Lyrae is about 0.75, only 40 or 50 times brighter than our Sun. Their period is shorter, typically less than one day, sometimes ranging down to seven hours.
The relationship between pulsation period and absolute magnitude of RR Lyraes makes them good standard candles for relatively near objects, especially within the Milky Way. They are extensively used in globular cluster studies, and also used to study chemical properties of older stars.
Knowing the period-luminosity relation for local RR Lyrae-type variable stars allows the distance of more distant stars of this type to be determined. The distance of RR Lyrae remained uncertain until 2002 when the Hubble Space Telescope was used to fix its distance within a 5% margin of error. The result was . When combined with measurements from the Hipparcos satellite and other sources, the result is a distance estimate of .

Enterococcus

Enterococcus is a genus of lactic acid bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes. 
Enterococci are Gram-positive cocci that often occur in pairs or short chains. They look like streptococci. Two species are regular gut flora organisms in the intestines of humans: "E. faecalis" (90-95%) and "E. faecium" (5-10%). 
Enterococci are "facultative anaerobic organisms". This means they can live in both oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor environments. 
Members of the genus "Enterococcus" were classified as Group D "Streptococcus" until 1984. Genomic DNA analysis showed they were a separate genus.
Important infections caused by "Enterococcus" include urinary tract infections, bacterial endocarditis, diverticulitis, and meningitis. 
Sensitive strains of these bacteria can be treated with ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin. Urinary tract infections can be treated by antibiotics, but many virulent strains of "Enterococcus" are resistant. From a medical standpoint, an important feature of this genus is the high level of antibiotic resistance. This rules out some important antibiotics.

"Mycoplasma" are the smallest bacterial cells yet discovered. They are typically about 0.1  µm in diameter.
Many species are parasitic, pathogenic or saprophytic, and can survive without oxygen. In humans, "M. genitalium" causes urethritis, and "M. pneumoniae" is an important cause of pneumonia.

Micropaleontology

Micropaleontology (also sometimes spelled as micropalaeontology) is the branch of paleontology that studies microfossils. Microfossils are fossils generally not larger than four millimeters, and commonly smaller than one millimeter. A microscope is used to study them. Every kingdom of organisms is represented in the microfossil record. Microfossils can provide important information about the ecology in the past.
People who study micropaleontology are called micropaleontologists. Taxonomy and statistics are important parts of micropaleontology. 
Microfossils are most common in sediment that forms beneath water, particularly ocean water or lake water. Very old microfossils may be found in rock. Special techniques are used to separate microfossils from rock. For example, the shells of diatoms and some other organisms are made of silica; other materials in the rock can sometimes be removed with acid, leaving just the silica shells.
Micropaleontology can be divided into four areas of study. The different areas of study use different techniques to separate the microfossils. This is because the microfossils are made of different minerals: 
The area of study for pollen and spores, including fossils, is called palynology.

Palynology

Palynology is the study of very small natural particles. The word literally means the "study of dust". A palynologist is someone whose job is to identify what the particles are. Samples of particles can come from the air or water or soil or rocks. They could be organic and inorganic. Micropaleontology is a related area of study; it involves very small fossils.
A palynologist uses a microscope. They may also use chemical tests to find out what a particle is made of.
The methods used to study fossils in micropaleontology and in palynology are often different. Micropaleontology often involves breaking and dissolving rocks. Palynology often involves soil or sediment.
The main work of a palynologist is to identify each particle. Many different kinds of particles might be in the same sample. They may include:
When the palynologist knows what particles are present in a sample, they may be able to say what the temperature or environmental chemistry was like where the sample came from. They may also be able to say where the sample came from.
Palynology is used in forensic science to learn where something came from, by looking at the particles in or on it.
Palynology is also very important in the study of climate history. In bodies of water such as lakes, ponds, and the ocean, sediment builds up slowly, so that the oldest sediment is at the bottom. There are ways to take a sample of the sediment that doesn't disturb the layers (either using a tube, or by freezing).
In glacial lakes, the sediment may have varves, which are two layers per year that are different colours. If there are varves, a lot of detailed information can be discovered in a core sample.

Delta Cephei

Delta Cephei (δ Cep, δ Cephei) is a binary star system about 887 light-years away in the northern constellation of Cepheus, the King. At this distance, the apparent magnitude of the star is reduced by 0.23 as a result of gas and dust along the line of sight. 
Delta Cephei, found by John Goodricke in 1784, was only the second Cepheid variable discovered. It is very important because its distance is extremely well known. This is partly because it is in a star cluster, close enough for the precise Hubble Space Telescope/Hipparcos parallaxes to give a good result. As a result, it is known as a "fundamental distance calibrator", or absolute candle. Delta Cephei is a classical, or type I, Cepheid variable.
The only Cepheid variable closer to us is Polaris, the North Star, whose distance is still not exactly known.
Delta Cephei is emitting around 2,000 times the Sun's luminosity. This is producing a strong stellar wind, which, with the pulsations and shocks in the star's atmosphere, is ejecting mass at the rate of masses per year. This is the equivalent to the mass of the Sun roughly every million years. The matter is flowing outward at a velocity of about 35 km s. This expelled gas forms a nebula about one parsec across, centered on Delta Cephei, and contains 0.07–0.21 solar masses of neutral hydrogen. A bow shock is being formed where the stellar wind is colliding with the surrounding interstellar medium.

Jackdaw

The Jackdaw ("Corvus monedula") is a large bird, a member of the crow family Corvidae. It is black, with the back of the head grey.
The jackdaw is common over the whole of Europe and much of Asia. It is mostly a resident, although northern and eastern populations migrate south in winter. It is about in length,
The jackdaw is gregarious and vocal, living in small groups with a complex social structure. It is found in farmland, open woodland, on coastal cliffs, and in urban settings. 
Jackdaws are omnivorous and opportunistic. They eat a wide variety of plant material and invertebrates, as well as food waste from urban areas. Jackdaws are monogamous and build simple nests of sticks in cavities in trees, cliffs, or buildings. About five pale blue or blue-green eggs with brown speckles are laid and incubated by the female. The young fledge in four to five weeks.
In his book "King Solomon's Ring", Konrad Lorenz described and analysed the complex social interactions in a Jackdaw flock which lived around his house in Altenberg, Austria. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration. 
Lorenz found that the birds have a hierarchy, with higher-ranked birds dominating lower-ranked birds. Pair-bonded birds share the same rank. Young males establish their individual status before pairing with females. Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order, and are the last to have access to food and shelter. Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the flock, became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each bird in the flock.

Mount Ebenezer

Mount Ebenezer is a pastoral station and roadhouse in the south of the Northern Territory, Australia. It is located on the Lasseter Highway, from the Stuart Highway to the east and to Uluṟu in the west. Mount Ebenezer is owned by the community of Imaṉpa, which is surrounded by the property. It is one of the few Aboriginal-owned stations in the Territory. It is managed by Lisanote Pty Ltd, a company also owned by the Imaṉpa Community. This company also operates the Angas Downs Indigenous Protected Area, which borders the property to the west. The lease for the property is held by the Fogarty family.
The area falls within the traditional homeland of the southern Luritja people (Matuntara). Mount Ebenezer, the mountain that the station was named after, is in the Basedow Ranges and can be seen to the north of the roadhouse. The mountain itself is named for Ebenezer Flint, who worked in the area in 1871 on the Overland Telegraph Line. In the early 1920s, a pioneer named William Liddle established the Angas Downs sheep station to the west of the Basedow Ranges. He had previously worked at the telegraph station in Alice Springs. He settled at Angas Downs with his wife Mary (an Aranda woman) and had several children. From the late 1920s, the family began to use the Mount Ebenezer area as an extension of Angas Downs.
Mount Ebenezer was established as its own station in 1947 by William's second son, Harold Liddle. He was one of the first people of Aboriginal descent to get a perpetual lease for a pastoral property. Liddle sold the new station to Ted Kunoth in 1952. Kunoth built a roadhouse to service tourist traffic between the Stuart Highway and Uluṟu. In 1978, Kunoth agreed to allow the Aboriginal people of the area to set up a community on a part of the station's lands. The area at Imaṉpa, beneath the Basedow Ranges, was removed from the property for this. Kunoth sold the property's lease to Alan Rogers, who then resold to the Fogarty family in 1993.

When the territory was ruled by the Spanish, its name was "Villa Cisneros". It has a size of roughly . To the north, the 26th parallel is the border, and to the south, the territory is limited by the 21° 20' parallel (and the border with Mauritania).
Originally, Portuguese traders called the territory "Rio do Ouro", they traded goods for gold dust, in the year 1442. They believed to be in Mali ruled by Mansa Musa. Mali was famed for its gold deposits, despite the fact that gold was never found there, and only further south in Akjoujt and south of the Niger River. Historic maps show a river running from the center of Africa to the Atlantic Ocean, newer maps show a shorter river which ends in a wadi named Megeta Mersug. In 1886, a Spanish expedition searched for this river, but did not find it.

Platform shoe

Platform shoes are shoes that have extremely dense soles at least four inches high. They are often made out of plastics, rubber or cork. Platform shoes were first worn during the Ancient era. They are known to add height to whoever is wearing them. The shoes are oftentimes worn to avoid coming in contact with urban street filth, grime and muck. These shoes were very popular between the 1930s and the 1980s in the United States, Europe and the United Kingdom. They were worn mostly by girls or young women, although middle-aged or elderly women sometimes wear the shoes. Comfort platforms were invented during the disco music era, and would be designed to mix added heights and sneaker style or orthotic comforts. The fad eventually fizzled out during the late 1980s and early 1990s, though by then people of all ages, particularly girls and young to middle-aged women, wore the shoes.

Nature, first published on 4 November 1869, is the world's most cited scientific journal. It is also the longest continuously published scientific weekly.
Most scientific journals are now highly specialized. "Nature" is one of the few journals which still publish original research articles across the whole range of science. Important new advances and original scientific research is published as articles or letters in "Nature". Surveys and reviews of important research fields are also published.
Research scientists are the primary audience for the journal, but the readership includes many others who are interested in science. Therefore, articles are written and edited to make them understandable to scientists in other fields and the educated general public. 
Towards the front of each issue are editorials, news and feature articles on issues of general interest to scientist. Topics include current affairs, science funding, business, scientific ethics and research breakthroughs. There are also sections on books and arts. Because of limits on the length of articles, often the printed text is a summary of the work in question. Details may be put in "supplementary material" on the journal's website.
Nature has spun off a series of more specialised journals which publish longer, more technical articles which would be unsuitable for Nature's wider readership.

<doc id="391226" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=391226" title="Diabetic retinopathy">
Diabetic retinopathy

Diabetic retinopathy, is the most common eye disease caused by diabetes, it damages the retinas in both eyes, causing vision problems which may lead to blindness.
It affects up to 80 percent of all patients who have had diabetes for 10 years or more. However it is possible that at least 90% of these new cases could be kept from becoming severe with early diagnosis and proper treatment.
Diabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs. As new blood vessels form at the back of the eye as a part of "proliferative diabetic retinopathy" (PDR), they can bleed (ocular hemorrhage) and blur vision. The first time this happens, it may not be very severe. In most cases, it will leave just a few specks of blood, or spots, floating in a person's visual field, though the spots often go away after a few hours.
These spots are often followed within a few days or weeks by a much greater leakage of blood, which blurs vision. In extreme cases, a person will only be able to tell light from dark in that eye. It may take the blood anywhere from a few days to months or even years to clear from the inside of the eye, and in some cases the blood will not clear. These types of large hemorrhages tend to happen more than once, often during sleep.
On funduscopic exam, a doctor will see spots, flame hemorrhages, and dot-blot hemorrhages.
Elevation of blood-glucose levels can also cause edema (swelling) of the crystalline lens as a result of sorbitol (sugar alcohol) building up in the lens. This edema often causes temporary myopia (nearsightedness). A common sign of swelling of the lens is blurring of distance vision while near vision remains adequate.
During the first three stages of diabetic retinopathy, no treatment is needed, unless there is macular edema. To prevent diabetic retinopathy from getting worse, diabetics should control their levels of blood sugar, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol.
Proliferative retinopathy is treated with scatter laser surgery, which helps to shrink the abnormal blood vessels. During the surgery 1,000 to 2,000 laser burns are placed in the areas of the retina away from the macula, causing the abnormal blood vessels to shrink. Two or more sessions usually are required to complete treatment. There may be some loss of peripheral (side) vision, and color vision, and night vision may also be slightly reduced.
Scatter laser treatment works best before the abnormal fragile, new blood vessels which grow because of the disease have started to bleed. Treatment may still be possible after bleeding has begun in some cases.
Macular edema is treated with focal laser treatment. Up to several hundred small laser burns are placed in the areas of retinal leakage surrounding the macula. These burns cauterize the blood vessels, reduces tha amount of leakage and fluid build-up in the retina. The surgery is usually done in one session but further treatments may be needed. If both eyes are affected by macular edema only one is treated at a time usually a few weeks apart.
Focal laser treatment stabilizes vision and reduces the risk of vision loss by 50 percent. In a small number of cases, if vision is lost, it can be improved.
Viteroctomy is the surgical removal of the "vitreous humur". The vitreous humur is a clear, thick, gel-like fluid, that fills the inside of the eyeball and helps it to maintain its shape.
This treatment is done in cases of proliferative retinopathy that causes severe scar tissue to form on the retina or when new blood vessels continue to grow on the retina after laser treatments.
According to research done by the National Eye Institute, prompt treatment of diabetic macular edema with the drug Lucentis, with or without laser treatment, resulted in better vision than laser treatment alone, or steroid injections. When injected into the eye, Lucentis, and two other similar drugs, Avastin or Aylea, reduce fluid leakage and interfere with the growth of new blood vessels in the retina.

Curse of Tippecanoe

The name Curse of Tippecanoe (also known as Tecumseh's Curse, the Presidential Curse, Zero-Year Curse, the Twenty-Year Curse, or the Twenty-Year Presidential Jinx) is used to describe the death of Presidents of the United States in office while elected or re-elected in a year ending in "0".
The "curse" began when President William Henry Harrison (elected in 1840) died in office from pneumonia just one month after becoming President. According to a folk tale, the "curse" happened because then-General Harrison had fought on Native American grounds during the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe. The battle was famous, and "Old Tippecanoe" became Harrison's nickname. But the battle made the Native Americans so angry that they cursed his name.
The last President included in this "curse" to die was John F. Kennedy. He was elected in 1960 and assassinated in 1963. Two later Presidents elected in "0" years—Ronald Reagan (1980) and George W. Bush (2000)—survived assassination attempts.
The following Presidents were part of the "curse":
The only president who died in office without being elected in a "cursed" year was Zachary Taylor, who was elected in 1848 and died in 1850.
The most recent two Presidents elected in a "zero" year survived the "curse":
Many people think that the curse was broken or lifted when John Hinckley tried to kill Ronald Reagan while he left a hotel in Washington, D.C.. After Reagan survived the attack no other Presidents after him were harmed until George W. Bush was elected. When George W. Bush was elected in 2001, someone tried to kill him, but did not succeed.

Assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan

The Assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan happened on Monday, March 30, 1981. 69 days after becoming President, Ronald Reagan was leaving after a speaking engagement at the Washington Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C.. Shots were fired by John Hinckley, Jr. as he left to enter the presidential limo. The assassination attempt started concern about gun control. 
At 2:27 pm Eastern Time, as Reagan exited the hotel through "President's Walk" and its K Street NW exit toward his waiting limousine. Hinckley waited within the crowd of civilians. While the Secret Service blocked those attending the president's speech, in a "colossal mistake" the agency allowed an unsearched group to stand within feet of him, behind a rope line. 
Reagan unexpectedly passed right in front of Hinckley. Believing he would never get a better chance, Hinckley fired a Röhm RG-14 .22 long rifle blue steel revolver six times in 1.7 seconds. 
Five out of the six shots missed the president. The first bullet hit White House Press Secretary James Brady in the head. The second bullet hit District of Columbia police officer Thomas Delahanty in the back of his neck as he turned to protect Reagan. Hinckley now had a clear shot at the president, but the third bullet overshot him and hit the window of a building across the street. 
As Special Agent In Charge Jerry Parr quickly pushed Reagan into the limousine, the fourth bullet hit Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy in the abdomen as he spread his body over Reagan to make himself a target. The fifth bullet hit the bullet-resistant glass of the window on the open side door of the limousine. The sixth and final bullet ricocheted off the armored side of the limousine and hit the president in his left underarm, grazing a rib and lodging in his lung, stopping nearly 1 inch (25mm) from his heart. Parr's prompt reaction saved Reagan from being hit in the head.
Reagan got a punctured lung and heavy internal bleeding. He got medical attention quickly. No formal transfer of presidential power took place, although Secretary of State Alexander Haig stated that he was "in control here" while Vice President George H. W. Bush returned to Washington.
There was a controversy at the White House when Reagan was at the hospital. At a press conference, Alexander Haig spoke to reporters and said the he was "in charge" because of the order of succession. 
Bush was out of Washington and he thought that as Secretary of State he was to succeed, but in reality, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Tip O'Neill was to succeed Reagan and Bush to be in charge. Haig was angry about his mistake as was O'Neill. This feud left Haig to resign after about a year.
The shooter was 30-year old John Hinckley. Hinckley said that he wanted to shoot President Reagan to impress actress Jodie Foster. He planned the assassination after he saw the movie "Taxi Driver" and there was a scene similar to the event.
Hinckley decided to copy DeNiro's character in the movie. He began to stalk President Jimmy Carter. He was surprised at how easy it was to get close to the president—only one foot away at one event. He was arrested in October 1980 at Nashville International Airport for illegal possession of firearms. Even though Carter made a campaign stop there, the Federal Bureau of Investigation did not connect this arrest to the President and did not tell the United States Secret Service. 
He wrote three or four more notes to Foster in early March 1981. Foster gave these notes to her dean, who gave them to the Yale police department. After this, the police wanted to find Hinckley, but failed. Hinckley soon moved to Washington, D.C. to carry-out his assassination plan.
Nobody was killed in the attack. Press Secretary James Brady was left paralyzed and permanently disabled. Brady died in August 2014. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity. He is in a psychiatric facility.
Reagan was the first serving U.S. President to survive being shot in an assassination attempt. The members of his staff were anxious for the president to appear to be recovering quickly, and the morning after his operation he saw visitors and signed a piece of legislation. Reagan left the hospital on the 13th day. He was able to travel outside of Washington 49 days later.
Before the shooting, Reagan had the lowest approval ratings than any other president during his first term in office. After the shooting, Reagan's approval ratings rose. The assassination attempt boosted his popularity and some may say that it helped him win his re-election campaign in 1984.
Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity on June 21, 1982. The defense psychiatric reports had found him to be insane while the prosecution reports declared him legally sane. 
Following his lawyers' advice, he declined to take the stand in his own defense. Hinckley was confined at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C., where he is still being held.

Murchison meteorite

The Murchison meteorite is named after the place it fell: Murchison, Victoria, Australia. It is large (>100 kg) and it was seen falling. It is one of the most studied meteorites, since it belongs to a group of meteorites rich in organic compounds, known as carbonaceous chondrites.
On 28 September 1969 at about 10:58 am, a bright fireball was seen. It separated into three fragments before disappearing, leaving a cloud of smoke. About 30 seconds later, a tremor was heard. People found fragments over an area larger than 13 km², with fragments up to 7 kg. One, weighing 680 g, broke through a roof and fell in hay. The total collected mass exceeds 100 kg.
The whole question of the biochemistry is: were the organic compounds definitely in the meteorite before it landed? Also, how many different kinds of compounds were there? The details below answer these questions as: Q1 yes; Q2 very many.
This type of meteorite is rich in carbon and among the most chemically primitive meteorites. Murchison contains over 15 amino acids. All the amino acids found in the Murchison meteorite have been synthesised in laboratory experiments by the action of electric discharge on a mixture of methane, nitrogen, and water with traces of ammonia.
The amino acids were mostly racemic. This means the chirality of their enantiomers are almost equally left- and right-handed, which suggests they are not caused by terrestrial contamination. A complex mixture of alkanes was isolated as well, similar to that found in the Miller-Urey experiment. Serine and threonine, often earthly contaminants, were absent from the samples.
In 1997 research showed that individual amino-acids from Murchison were enriched in the nitrogen isotope N relative to their terrestrial counterparts. This confirmed an extraterrestrial source. The organic materials identified included sugar-like compounds (polyols).
Research in 2005 showed that an amino acid like -proline is capable of catalyzing the formation of chiral sugars. The catalysis is non-linear, and produces more of one enantiomer than the other. In other words, a small excess of left-handed amino acids may explain terrestrial life's preference for right-handed sugars.
Several lines of evidence show that the inside of well-preserved fragments from Murchison are pristine (not contaminated). A 2010 study using high resolution analytical tools including spectroscopy, identified 14,000 molecular compounds including 70 amino acids in a sample of the meteorite. There may be 50,000 or more unique molecular compositions; the team thinks millions of distinct organic compounds might be in the meteorite.
Measured purine and pyrimidine compounds are indigenous components of the Murchison meteorite. Carbon isotope ratios for uracil and xanthine of 44.5‰ and +37.7‰, respectively, indicate a non-terrestrial origin for these compounds. These results show that many organic compounds which are components of life on Earth were already present in the early Solar System. They may have played a key role in life's origin.

Boeing 314

The Boeing 314 Clipper was a flying boat. It was made by the Boeing Airplane Company between 1938 and 1941. It was one of the biggest planes at that time, and it used the wing of the XB-15 bomber. Twelve Clippers were made for Pan Am. Three of them were sold to BOAC during the Battle of Britain (1940). 
Pan American had asked for a flying boat with a very long range. Boeing wanted to make it, and Pan American asked for six of Boeing's planes. Boeing engineers used a wing taken from one of Boeing's earlier planes. The new plane had Wright Twin Cyclone. 
The plane made flew for the first time on June 7, 1938. The test pilot found some things wrong with the plane. Boeing fixed these and the plane was fine.
Weight was very important. Every passenger could only have of baggage for free. They had to pay $3.25 per lb ($7.15/kg) if they went over this limit. 
Pan Am's "Clippers" were meant for luxury. The seats could be changed into beds. The plane normally flew at only , so flights sometimes lasted more than 12 hours. The 314s had a lounge and dining area, and the planes had chefs from four-star hotels. Men and women had dressing rooms, too. The luxury on Pan American's Boeing 314s was better than anything since then. They were for very rich people. It cost about the same amount as it would have cost to fly on Concorde in 2006. 
The 314 was also successful because of its Pan Am flight crews. They were very good at long-distance flying. Many of the flights had another crew for training. Only the best pilots flew the Boeing 314. If it was hard to see because of fog, pilots sometimes landed at sea and then moved Clipper on the water.
The first 314, "Honolulu Clipper", started being used in January 1939.
When war started in the Pacific, "Pacific Clipper" was flying to New Zealand. Instead of going back to Honolulu, it went to New York. This was done to avoid being shot down by Japanese fighters. 
Pan Am's Boeing 314s were used by the military in World War II. The only thing that changed was how the painting on the plane looked. The Clippers were still flown by their crews from Pan Am. The Boeing 314s used by the military were called C-98s. Winston Churchill flew on Boeing 314s sometimes.
After the war, many Clippers were given back to Pan Am. However, the Boeing 314 was now out-of-date.
One Pan Am 314, called the "California Clipper", had flown more than one million miles when it was retired. Three Boeing 314s crashed. 
No Boeing 314s still exist today. However, there is a replica at the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, Foynes, County Limerick, Ireland.

It is on the western side of the Ras Nouadhibou peninsula. The ghost town is west of Nouadhibou. It is also the name of a daira at the Sahrawi refugee camps in south-western Algeria. The name comes from the Spanish word "" which is a ditch which carries rainwater to the crops. By 2002, it had been abandoned and parts of it had been covered by sand. At the time, only a few Imraguen fishermen lived there and the area was guarded by a Mauritanian military outpost, despite this not being formally Mauritanian territory. 
La Güera is the southernmost town of Western Sahara. It is claimed by both the Kingdom of Morocco and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. Lagouira is situated south of the Moroccan Wall, and abandoned by both Moroccan and POLISARIO forces.

Histrionic personality disorder

Histrionic personality disorder (HPD) is a cluster B personality disorder. The name is derived from Latin "histrio", which is usually translated as actor. People with this condition constantly seek to direct attention to their own person. Very often they also flirt and try to seduce others in inappropriate ways to get this attention, for example by being exhibitionist. These attempts at seduction usually start when they are teenagers. Histrionics feel a strong need to receive a lot of appreciation, admiration and reassurance. HPD affects about four times as many women (4%) as men (1%). It has a prevalence of between two and three percent in the general population, and between ten and fifteen percent in mental health institutions.
HPD lies in the dramatic cluster of personality disorders. People with HPD have a high need for attention, make loud and inappropriate appearances, exaggerate their behaviors and emotions, and crave stimulation. They may exhibit sexually provocative behavior, express strong emotions with an impressionistic style, and can be easily influenced by others. Associated features include egocentrism, self-indulgence, continuous longing for appreciation, and persistent manipulative behavior to achieve their own needs.
A mnemonic that can be used to remember the characteristics of histrionic personality disorder is "PRAISE ME":
Most histrionics also have other mental disorders. HPD is comorbid (often occurs alongside): mood disorders, eating disorders, somatoform disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and other personality disorders - especially antisocial, borderline, narcissistic and dependent.

Pokémon Puzzle League is a puzzle video game for the Nintendo 64 game console. It was released in North America and Europe in 2000. Unlike most "Pokémon" games, it was never released in Japan. It is based upon Nintendo's "Panel de Pon" puzzle video game series, with a "Pokémon" theme. It is the only game to take place in the "Pokémon" anime universe. It was released for the Wii's Virtual Console in 2008.
Players clear blocks that come down by lining them up in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more blocks. The lines have to have the same kind of block. As new blocks come down, the playfield rises. If it makes it to the top, the player loses. The player can stop the playfield from rising by clearing blocks. In two-player games, clearing more than one line at once causes "garbage" blocks to come down on the opponent's side of the field. Garbage blocks can be cleared by clearing lines below it.
The game has 2D and 3D modes. In 3D mode, the playfield is a cylinder that is 18 blocks wide.
In two-player games, players can select one of fourteen Pokémon trainers to play as. Unlike other "Pokémon" games, trainers and their Pokémon do not have an effect on the gameplay.

Angas Downs Indigenous Protected Area

Angas Downs Indigenous Protected Area is a protected area in the south of the Northern Territory, Australia. It consists of a pastoral lease that is owned by the indigenous community Imaṉpa. It is located along the Luritja Highway, about 135 km east from Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park and 100 km south-east of Kings Canyon. It borders the Mount Ebenezer Station to the east and the Curtin Springs Station to the west. The property was made an indigenous protected area on 10 June 2009, and forms part of Australia's National Reserve System.
Angas Downs is part of the homeland of southern Luritja and northern Yankunytjatjara people. Together they are called Matutjara, and speak a dialect that is a mix of the two languages. The people living at Imaṉpa include Luritja, Yankunytjatjara and Pitjantjatjara. The property contains several places (songlines and sacred sites) that are important to native families' "Tjukurpa". Several animals that live in the reserve represent ancestral totems, reminders of people's identity, kinship and descent. Many of the plants and animals have also been important sources of food for the locals for thousands of years.
Previous land management practices and other pressures damaged Angas Downs and many native species disappeared. Game animals and edible plants are less common, and feral animals (camel and horse) and weeds are a major problem. The Central Land Council runs a ranger program in Imanpa.
The area of Angas Downs falls within the traditional homeland of the southern Luritja and northern Yankunytjatjara people. Together they are called Matutjara, and speak a dialect that is a mix of the two languages.
In the early 1920s, a pioneer named William Liddle came to this area looking for land in which he could raise sheep. He arrived at Wollunga, a soakage in the northern end of what is now Angas Downs, and found water there. Further south, he passed through a break in the Wollara Range, visiting another water hole near the site of what would later become the first homestead of Angas Downs. On his way south, Liddle located more water sources at Wilpiya (near the Kernot Range) and at Curtin Springs. In Oodnadatta in 1927, he bought 2000 sheep and drove them northwards along the Finke River and then southwards to the Wollara Range. In 1930, Liddle got a pastoral lease from the government for a block of land around the Wollara Range. He named his property Angas Downs, and settled here with his wife Mary (an Aranda woman) and their children. They built their homestead in the pass of the Wollara Range, which then became known as the Liddle Hills.
In 1945, William sold Angas Downs to two of his sons, Arthur and Milton. They moved the homestead to its present location, where there is a more reliable source of water. They also changed the station's stock from sheep to cattle. In 1947, another of William's sons, Harold Liddle, established a station of his own to the east at Mount Ebenezer. Arthur Liddle took over Milton's half of Angas Downs in 1956.
From July to October 1962, Frederick G. G. Rose stayed at Angas Downs and documented the local Aboriginal people and their way of life. He took a big interest in documenting how aboriginal culture was affected by contact with White civilisation. He also recorded the genealogy of the Liddle family and other Aboriginal families living on Angas Downs.
The Aboriginal community of Imaṉpa was formed near Mount Ebenezer in 1978. At Angas Downs, Arthur Liddle and his family continued to raise cattle during the 1980s and 1990s. As with many pastoral enterprises during this time, Angas Downs struggled with money. The property was eventually bought by the nearby Imaṉpa community, on 2 May 1994. Since then, it has been owned by the Imanpa Development Association, and managed by their company Lisanote Pty. Ltd. Angas Downs was declared an Indigenous Protected Area in 2009. The property still holds 300–400 cattle, which are restricted to a 266 km enclosure in the southeast.
The reserve covers about . The land is mostly flat, but there are two main ranges: the Kernot Range in the southwest and the Wollara Range (or Liddle Hills) in the centre. The old homestead is located in the centre of the property, in a valley of the Wollara Range. The new homestead is further to the south, along the Luritja Highway. This highway runs north–south through the middle of the property. It meets the Lasseter Highway at the southern end of the reserve.

Corrective rape

Corrective rape (sometimes called curative rape) is a hate crime where a person is raped, because of their perceived sexual orientation. People claim to be able to "cure" homosexuals by raping them. The people raping say that they can "correct" their orientation, to turn them heterosexual, or to make them "act" more in conformity with gender stereotypes. The term was coined in South Africa after well-known cases of corrective rapes of lesbians like Eudy Simelane and Zoliswa Nkonyana became public. There are many health problems associated with corrective rape, and although some countries have laws protecting LGBT people, corrective rape is often overlooked.

Macedonians

Macedonians are people who live in the Republic of Macedonia. Macedonians also can mean the ethnic group which speaks the Macedonian language.
The Slavic languages from which Macedonian developed are thought to have grown in the region during the post-Roman period. Many parts of Macedonian culture developed during the rule of Medieval Byzantine, Bulgarian and Serbian Empires. Each of these empires controlled the region for a time. 
Macedonians' genetic background is thought to be the same as Balkan prehistoric and historic demographic processes. This background is also found in other South Slavs, especially Bulgarians, Serbs, Bosnians, Montenegrins, but also in northern Greeks and Romanians. 
The appearance of Slavs in Macedonia and the Balkans happened after the end of Roman authority. Migrations into the area happened, but on a smaller scale: 
"It is now generally agreed that the people who lived in the Balkans after the Slavic "invasions" were probably for the most part the same as those who had lived there earlier, although the creation of new political groups and arrival of small immigrants caused people to look at themselves as distinct from their neighbours, including the Byzantines". 
Later, the Sclaveni in Macedonia were added into the Bulgarian Empire.
The history of the ethnic Macedonians has been shaped by population shifts and political developments in the region of Macedonia. After the end of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century, the Socialist Republic of Macedonia was created after World War II, a state in the framework of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
A large majority of ethnic Macedonians live along the valley of the river Vardar, the central region of the Republic of Macedonia. They form about 64.18% of the population of the Republic of Macedonia (1,297,981 people according to the 2002 census). Smaller numbers live in eastern Albania, northern Greece, and southern Serbia, mostly near the border areas of the Republic of Macedonia. A large number of Macedonians have immigrated overseas to Australia, United States, Canada and in many European countries: Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Austria, among others.
In the past, the Macedonian population was mostly involved with agriculture. The beginning of the People's Republic of Macedonia started a social change. The change was based on Socialist principles, a middle and heavy industry were started.
The Macedonian language () is a member of the Eastern group of South Slavic languages. Standard Macedonian was started as the official language of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. After being codified in the 1940s, a strong literary tradition has developed.
The closest relative of Macedonian is Bulgarian, followed by Serbo-Croat. All the South Slavic languages, including Macedonian, form a dialect continuum, in which Macedonian is between Bulgarian and Serbian. The Torlakian dialect group is intermediate between Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian. 
The orthography of Macedonian includes an alphabet, which is an adaptation of the Cyrillic script. There are also language-specific ways of spelling and punctuation.

<doc id="391383" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=391383" title="Gender role">
Gender role

Gender role is the idea that people should behave in certain ways because of their gender. As an example, it was traditionally the role of the man to earn money, and the role of the woman to educate the children. Observed behaviour can either come from the person, or be a result of social and cultural factors a person is exposed to. In the case that they are determined by the society and culture a person grows up in they are the result of socialization. There is still a discussion to what extent the observed behaviour is a function of the personality, and to what extent social factors play a role in the determinatioon of gender-specific differences in behaviour..
Gender roles are dependent on the culture and history of the society that they are part of. While most cultures express two genders, some express more. Androgyny, for example, has been proposed as a third gender. Other societies have been claimed to have more than five genders, and some non-Western ones have three genders – man, woman and third gender. Gender expression refers to the external manifestation of one's gender identity, through "masculine," "feminine," or gender-variant or gender neutral behavior, clothing, hairstyles, or body characteristics.
The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women says that stereotyped gender role should be abolished.

Kale

Kale is a vegetable with green or purple leaves. It is also called borecole. It is in the group of vegetables called "Brassica oleracea" or wild cabbage. It is cruciferous because of the shape of its flowers.
A plant that would have been first cultivated in the Mediterranean area, it was called in these times cabbage well before the well rounded variety existed. Kale was a significant crop in Roman times; it became a basic staple for peasants in the Middle Ages and it was brought in the United States by the English in the XVII century.
Kale is one of the most resistant from the cabbage family; it can support temperatures as low as -­15 °C but it doesn’t sustain high temperatures. Since it resists to cold temperatures and grows easily, kale was for a long time a very appreciated winter vegetable especially in Scotland, Germany, Holland and Scandinavia. Today, it is eaten the world over.
Kale has large stringy leaves, very curly, with a well-marked flavor. Their color varies from pale green to dark green, sometimes to blue-tinted green. Those leaves are not well rounded, a characteristic expressed by the Latin word which describes this variety of cabbage « acephala » and which means « without head ». Those leaves surmount a fine whitish and very fibrous stem, it can measure from 30 to 40 cm. Kale is so decorative that ornamental varieties were developed.
Kale is an excellent source of vitamin K, C, A and manganese; it is a very good source of fiber, copper, tryptophan, calcium, vitamin B6 and potassium. Kale is a good source of iron, magnesium, vitamin E, omega 3 fats, vitamin B2, protein, vitamin B1, folate, phosphorus and vitamin B3.
Kale is rarely eaten raw. We can add it sparingly to salads. It transmits its well-marked taste to soups and stews. You can blanch it to attenuate its flavour. Kale is delicious coated with sauce, sprinkled with cheese or in purée (alone or with mashed potatoes).
Choose kale with firm leaves, well colored and relatively small, without stain or mold. One cup cooked makes 130 grams. Cut the leaves around the stem, cut the core, separate each leaf. Wash well with running water or with vinegary water to remove dirt and bugs that could remain. We cook kale in water or we steam it from 20 to 30 min, braised in a slow cooker, stuffed or sautéed in a wok.
Put the kale leaves very tight rather than loose in refrigerator without washing it, inside a perforated plastic bag. It can be kept in this way from five to ten days, but it is more flavorful and less bitter when it is eaten rapidly. Kale can be frozen after having been blanched two to three minutes, until the leaves soften a bit.

Boeing 377

The Boeing 377, sometimes called the Stratocruiser, was an airliner made by Boeing after World War II. It was made from the C-97 Stratofreighter, which was a type of Boeing B-29 Superfortress used to move troops around. The Stratocruiser first took off on July 8, 1947.
The Stratocruiser had four piston engines. It had a pressurized cabin and two decks. Airlines could fly for much longer with the Stratocruiser, to places like Hawaii. 
However, the Stratocruiser was a lot more expensive than the Douglas DC-6 and Lockheed Constellation. Only 55 Stratocruisers were made for airlines.
The Boeing 377 used the bottom and the wings of the B-50 Superfortress. The 377 was bigger than the Lockheed Constellation and Douglas DC-6 and it could fly for longer. Boeing stopped making the 377 in 1950.
Pressurization (first used on the Boeing 307) meant that if the plane was flying at , to the passengers it would be like they were on the ground. 
56 Stratocruisers were made. 55 of these were made for airlines. 
The Stratocruiser flew to Hawaii as well as many other places. It was one of the only planes with two decks (another one was the Breguet Deux-Ponts) until the Boeing 747 was made.
In the early 1960s the Stratocruiser was overtaken by jet planes like the de Havilland Comet, Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8. 
Many other types were made, but most of them only had changes made to the shape of the windows.
A company called Aero Spacelines started changing 377s to planes called Guppies in 1960s. There were three types: the Pregnant Guppy, Super Guppy, and Mini Guppy. 
The first of them was the Pregnant Guppy. After this they made the Super Guppy and then the Mini Guppy. The Super Guppy and the Mini Guppy had turboprop engines.
The Stratocruiser had 13 hull-loss accidents between 1951 and 1970. A hull-loss accident is when a plane is damaged so badly it cannot be fixed. 140 people died in these. The worst accident happened on April 29, 1952.

Bronchoscopy

Bronchoscopy is a medical procedure which is used to look at the inside of a person's airway's. It can be used to see the inside of the trachea, and the bronchi and bronchioles within the lungs. There are three types of bronchoscopy: rigid, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy and CT virtual bronchoscopy (CTVB).
Rigid bronchoscopy is a straight rigid tube used to see into the trachea and proximal bronchi. It is usually done in an operating room under general anesthesia. It is usually used when there is a blockage in either the trachea or the primary bronchi. The diameter of the tube is large enough to insert instruments to remove obstructions.
During the procedure, a thin, flexible fiberoptic tube called a bronchoscope. is passed through the nose or mouth nose into the airways. The bronchoscope has a light and a camera which lets the doctor see into the airway. 
This technique uses data from multiple CT scans to create a three dimensional (3D) image. This allows doctors to see what is going on without having to operate.

Children's literature

Children's literature refers to books written for children and young people. Many famous authors wrote for children including Beatrix Potter, Dr. Seuss, A.A. Milne, J. M. Barrie, Edith Nesbit, Enid Blyton, Lewis Carroll, JRR Tolkien and C. S. Lewis. The Newbery Medal is an award given to writers for children.
Children's literature can be divided into several categories, but it is most easily categorised by genre or the intended age of the reader. An example of a classification based on age is young-adult fiction, which is written for children between the ages of 12 and 18.
A literary genre is the style of the book. It also refers to the technique, tone, content, or length.
Many children's books are meant to teach children the consequences of engaging in "bad" behaviour, such as running away, stealing and lying. "Tom Sawyer" and "Toby Tyler" are two notable examples of the genre.

The Division of Yarra was an Australian Electoral Division in the state of Victoria. It was located in inner eastern suburban Melbourne, and was named after the Yarra River. It originally covered the suburbs of Abbotsford, Collingwood, Richmond and part of Fitzroy. By 1969, it no longer covered Abbotsford or Fitzroy, but included Burnley and Hawthorn. Yarra was one of the original 75 divisions set up for the first Federal election in 1901. It was abolished in 1969.
It was a very safe Labor seat. It was held by only four people--Frank Tudor, a leader of the Australian Labor Party; James Scullin, the 13th Prime Minister of Australia; Stan Keon, an important figure in the ALP-DLP Split; and Jim Cairns, who later became Deputy Prime Minister of Australia.

Natural Killer T cell

Natural killer T cells (NKT) are cells formed from small lymphocytes. They are a type of T cell, and are different from natural killer cells (NK). NKT cells are important, but make up only 0.1% of all peripheral blood T cells.
NKT cells are a subset of T cells which also have molecular markers normally associated with NK cells. They are important in recognizing glycolipids from organisms such as mycobacterium, which cause tuberculosis.
NKT cells seem to be essential for several aspects of immunity because their dysfunction or deficiency leads to the development of autoimmune diseases (such as diabetes and atherosclerosis) and cancer. NKT cells have recently been implicated in the disease progression of human asthma.
The clinical potential of NKT cells lies in the rapid release of cytokines that promote or suppress different immune responses.

Gomez then leaves the house and does a dance routine with her backup dancers, while the maid watches from the house window. The video also features Gomez in front of a black background with lyrics from the song (such as "I'm ready for it" and "One in a million") flying around her.

Interferon

Interferons (IFNs) are proteins released by body cells in response to pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, parasites or to tumor cells. They allow cells to trigger the defenses of the immune system.
IFNs belong to the large class of glycoproteins known as cytokines. Interferons are named after their ability to "interfere" with virus replication inside host cells. 
IFNs also have other functions: 
About ten distinct IFNs have been identified in mammals; seven of these have been described for humans. All IFNs are very important for fighting viral infections.

M.U.G.E.N.

M.U.G.E.N. (or simply known as MUGEN) is a modifiable 2D fighting game engine that was created by Elecbyte and initially released in 1999. It was programmed in C, which was originally used in Allegro library, and it compared to 4 versions: DOS MUGEN, Winmugen, Linux Mugen and Mugen 1.0 as the latest release.
The Japanese term "mugen" means dream, fantasy or infinite.
In 1999, Elecbyte had a plan to create a customizable original fighting game engine, DOS-MUGEN. Then later, they created the first original MUGEN character called Kung Fu Man, among with 2 non-playable characters according to the intro and ending storyboards. Aside from it, the engine was released on July 17, 2001. It works platforms such as DOS Mugen, Winmugen and Linux Mugen which is allowed the users to customize before they distribute their website. DOS Mugen was ceased when Elecbyte switched into Linux platform in November 2001. Elecbyte had a request for donations in their site to legally obtain a Windows compiler to create a Windows version of M.U.G.E.N. However, the developers discontinued the project in 2003 and their website was shut off afterwards. Later, they speculated leaks to make public of a private Windows-based beta that was provided to donators. The public beta of Winmugen was released with "no limit" hack after their development.
In January 2011, they decided to create the latest release of previous versions, Mugen 1.0. It has more game features like victory screen to show the win quote of a character.
It is a 7-button (A,B, C, X, Y, Z and Start) game which includes Joystick, arrow keys, letters, number keys, number lock keys and function keys (for debugging). The main mode in menu screen is Arcade Mode, where you can choose only 1 character if you want to play it and fight random characters like other fighting games, especially Team Arcade and Team Co-op modes. VS mode is a 2-player challenge where you can play against your friend. In Team Arcade and Team VS modes, you can play with 1 non-playable character to beat opponents, excluding Team Co-op and Survival Co-op modes. In Survival mode, it is the endless stream of opponents where you can fight them. In Watch mode, you can see the characters with AI during the fight but you can't play as the character unless you press function that turn into playable character if the option of debugging keys is on.

Hyperbola

A hyperbola is a type of conic section. Like the other three types of conic sections - parabolas, ellipses, and circles - it is a curve formed by the intersection of a cone and a plane. A hyperbola is created when the plane intersects both halves of a double cone, creating two curves that look exactly like each other, but open in opposite directions. This occurs when the angle between the axis of the cone and the plane is less than the angle between a line on the side of the cone and the plane.
Hyperbolas can be found in many places in nature. For example, an object in open orbit around another object - where it never returns - can move in the shape of a hyperbola. On a sundial, the path followed by the tip of the shadow over time is a hyperbola.
One of the most well-known hyperbolas is the graph of the equation formula_1.
The two disconnected curves that make up a hyperbola are called arms or branches.
The two points where the branches are closest together are called the vertices. The line between these two points is called the "transverse axis" or "major axis". The midpoint of the transverse axis is the "center" of the hyperbola.
At large distances from the center, the branches of the hyperbola approach two straight lines. These two lines are called the asymptotes. As the distance from the center increases, the hyperbola gets closer and closer to the asymptotes, but never intersects them.
The "conjugate axis" or "minor axis" is perpendicular, or at a right angle to, the transverse axis. The endpoints of the conjugate axis are at the height where a segment that intersects the vertex and is perpendicular to the transverse axis intersects the asymptotes.
A hyperbola that has a center at the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system, which is the point (0,0), and has a transverse axis on the x-axis can be written as the equation
"a" is the distance between the center and a vertex. The length of the transverse axis is equal to "2a". "b" is the length of a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to an asymptote. The length of the conjugate axis is equal to "2b".
The two branches of the above type of hyperbola open to the left and the right. If the branches open up and down and the transverse axis is on the y-axis, then the hyperbola can be written as the equation 
A hyperbolic trajectory is the trajectory followed by an object when its velocity becomes more than the escape velocity of a planet, satellite, or star. For example, meteors approach on a hyperbolic trajectory, and interplanetary space probes leave on one.

<doc id="391690" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=391690" title="Eta Carinae">
Eta Carinae

Eta Carinae (η Carinae or η Car) is a superbright hypergiant star in the constellation Carina, about 7,500 to 8,000 light-years from the Sun. 
The system contains at least two stars, of which the primary is a luminous blue variable (LBV) that initially had around 150 solar masses, of which it has lost at least 30. A hot supergiant of about 30 solar masses is in orbit around the primary. An enormous thick red nebula surrounding Eta Carinae makes it impossible to see this companion optically. 
The Eta Carinae system is inside the Homunculus nebula, itself part of the much larger Carina nebula. Together they have a combined luminosity of over five million times the Sun's. It is not visible north of latitude 30°N and is seen moving round the pole south of latitude 30°S. Due to its mass and the stage of its life, it is expected to explode as a supernova in the future.
Eta Carinae was first recorded as a 4th magnitude star. It brightened from 1837 to 1856 in an event known as "the Great Eruption". Eta Carinae became the second brightest star in the sky between 11 and 14 March 1843 before fading well below naked eye visibility. 
It has brightened since about 1940, peaking above magnitude 4.5 in 2014. Eta Carinae is circumpolar south of latitude 30°S, so it is never seen north of latitude 30°N.
This stellar system is currently one of the most massive that can be studied in detail. Until recently, Eta Carinae was thought to be the most massive single star, but in 2005 it was proved to be a binary system. The most massive star in the Eta Carinae multiple star system probably has more than 100 times the mass of the Sun. There are other massive stars which are known to be more luminous and are more massive.
Stars like Eta Carinae produce over a million times as much light as the Sun. They are quite rare — only a few dozen are present in a galaxy the size of the Milky Way. They are assumed to be near or over the Eddington limit. That means the outward pressure of their radiation is almost strong enough to counteract gravity. Stars over 120 solar masses exceed the Eddington limit, and their gravity is barely strong enough to hold in their radiation and gas.
Eta Carinae's chief significance for astrophysics is its giant eruption, which was observed around 1843. In a few years, Eta Carinae produced almost as much visible light as a supernova explosion, but it survived. It was a 'supernova impostor' or 'failed supernova'. Eta Carinae's giant eruption was the prototype for this phenomenon.
One remarkable aspect of Eta Carinae is its changing brightness. It is currently classified as a luminous blue variable (LBV) binary star due to peculiarities in its pattern of brightening and dimming.
The ionizing radiation emitted by the secondary star in Eta Carinae is the major radiation source of the system. Much of this radiation is absorbed by the primary stellar wind.

The Mark Of Athena is the third book of the "Heroes of Olympus" series by Rick Riordan. In this book, the perspective of the story moves between Percy Jackson, Annabeth Chase, Leo Valdez, Jason Grace, and Piper McLean. All of the seven demigods appear in this book.
In the beginning, the Argo II is approaching Rome (Camp Jupiter) when suddenly, a statue pops into existence on the ship and almost knocks Annabeth overboard. The statue is Terminus, the Roman god of boundaries. He yells that he will not accept having weapons over the Pomerian Line (the camp boundary). After being irritated by a curious Leo and a charmspeaking Piper, Terminus tells them to "surrender, then leave". Annabeth sees Percy walking down in Camp Jupiter with Hazel and Frank as if they were best friends, and knew she was too close to give up. (She also notices that Percy is a praetor now and signs that New Rome had recently been attacked by an army of monsters.) She asks if it was against the rules to hover OVER New Rome, as technically it wouldn't be on Roman soil. Terminus agrees grudgingly to this, but tells them to not harm his city.

Tesla Motors

Tesla Motors is a company based in Palo Alto, California which makes electric cars. It was started in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Elon Musk (who also co-founded PayPal and is the CEO of SpaceX). Eberhard no longer works there. Today, Elon Musk is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). It started selling its first car, the Roadster in 2008.
Some car companies that were trying to start making electric cars in the early 2000's tried to make a car that wouldn't cost very much, so that many people would buy it. But it is hard to for a new company to make many cars for a low price right in the beginning. So Tesla Motors had a different idea. They would make a very expensive, very good electric car, and sell each one for a lot of money. Then after they had made some money, they would start making cars that weren't as expensive, and eventually they would make cheap electric cars that most people could buy. They also had an unusual idea to make only one kind of car at a time. So when they started making the less expensive car (Model S) they stopped making the Roadster. So far their ideas have been working, and they are one of the very few start-up companies that have been able to make electric cars and stay in business.
The Tesla name originally comes from Nikola Tesla. He was an inventor who worked with electricity, electric cars and many other ideas along with Thomas Edison a century earlier.
There were some test cars built from 2004 to 2007, but regular production started in 2008. From then until the end of 2011, they sold 2,150 Tesla Roadsters to customers in 31 countries. It sold for about $100,000 dollars, but it was very fast (0 to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds) and could go a long way before the batteries needed to be recharged. One big problem of electric cars compared to cars that run on gasoline, is that most electric cars could not go very far before needing to be recharged. A gasoline car can often go 300 or 400 miles before needing more gas, but most electric cars could not go over 100 miles on a charge (EV-1, RAV4-EV, etc.). The Roadster could go 220 miles on a single charge.
The Model S replaces the Roadster. It is sold with different battery sizes - for $58,750 it can go 160 miles. The top end can go 265 miles on a charge and with all the extras can cost $100,000. The 2013 Model S was named the MotorTrend Car of the Year, the 2013 Car of the Year by Automobile Magazine and the 2013 World Green Car at the New York International Auto Show. It has a 0.24 coefficient of drag, which is more aerodynamic than a Toyota Prius, so it uses less energy to push the air out of the way as it moves.
The Tesla Model X is an SUV that has been delayed, but is scheduled to come out in 2015.

Peripheral neuropathy

Peripheral neuropathy happens when the nerves of the peripheral nervous system suffer damage due to disease, trauma to the nerves or through side effects of a certain illness. The four patterns of this condition are polyneuropathy, mononeuropathy, nononeuritis mp and autonomic nerve damage. The most common of these is polyneuropathy which affects the feet and legs. The actual forms may be broken down by causes. Losses of muscle bulk and muscle twitches may be seen. Damage to the sensory nerves may lead to numbness, strong tingling or burning pain that is described as electric-like, freezing and burning. Autonomic nerve damage leads to issues, such as hypertension, sexual troubles, bladder dysfunction and abnormal heart rate. Neuropathy can happen with or without the presence of diabetes mellitus.

Officer Creek is a watercourse in the north-west of South Australia, on the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands. It is normally mostly dry except for periods of very high rainfall. It runs from the Musgrave Ranges southward into the Great Victoria Desert. The only major community on Officer Creek is Kaltjiti.
The land around Officer Creek is part of the traditional homeland of the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara. In September 1873, the explorer Ernest Giles and his team came to the creek during his second trip into the centre of Australia. At Kaltjiti, they encountered a large group of Aboriginal men. The Europeans fired shots from their rifles, allegedly because the Aboriginal people were throwing spears at them. Giles' group escaped unharmed, but did not report whether any of the Aboriginal men were hurt. He later acknowledged that aggression from the locals toward White people was usually due to them trespassing on sacred land. Giles may have interrupted an initiation or another kind of ceremony. Giles named the river "The Officer", and it was known by this name until the 1930s when it was renamed Officer Creek.

Lake Neale is a salt lake in the southwest corner of the Northern Territory, in Australia. It is on the north-west side of Lake Amadeus. The two lakes form part of a chain of salt lakes that stretches about , from Lake Hopkins in the west to the Finke River in the east. This drainage basin is known as the Amadeus Basin. The lake is usually a dry salt plain. It holds water for short periods after heavy rainfall. Lake Neale is on Aboriginal land, in the Petermann Aboriginal Land Trust. The Haasts Bluff lands are nearby to the north.
Lake Neale was named after Frank Neale, one of the pilots of an aerial expedition to accurately survey the desert regions northwest of Alice Springs in 1930. Neale flew one of the two planes that had been hired by explorer Donald Mackay for the expedition. The team made 15 survey flights over 24 days, in which they mapped the dimensions of Lakes Amadeus and Neale and found the even larger Lake Mackay, further to the north.
The first European to see Lake Neale was the explorer Ernest Giles in 1872. He had seen Kata Tjuta from far away and was making his way there. Lake Amadeus blocked his path. He also saw Lake Neale when he tried to reach Mount Unapproachable, on the northern side of the lake. He was coming from the east, and did not notice a land bridge between Neale and Amadeus. He mistook them as one big lake. William Tietkens corrected this mistake in an expedition of his own seventeen years later.

Migratory locust

The migratory locust ("Locusta migratoria") is the most widespread locust species, and the only species in the genus "Locusta". It occurs throughout Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. It used to be common in Europe but has now become rare there. 
Because of the vast geographic area it occupies, which comprises many different ecological zones, numerous subspecies have been described. However, not all experts agree on the validity of some of these subspecies. 
Many other species of Orthoptera with gregarious and migratory behavior are indicated with the name of 'locusts'.
The migratory locust is polyphenic. It has a solitary phase and a gregarious phase. This is a type of polymorphism where a single genotype produces two or more phenotypes. During development, an environmental factor causes a switch from one morph to another.
For the migratory locust, the switch is caused by population density. As the density of the population increases the locust transforms from the solitary phase to the gregarious phase, with intermediate phases.
The colour and size of the migratory locust changes according to its phase and its age. "Gregarious larvae" have a yellow to orange covering with black spots. "Solitary larvae" are green or brown. The "gregarious adult" is brownish with yellow, the latter colour becoming more intense and extensive on maturation. The "solitary adult" is brown with varying extent of green colour depending on the colour of the vegetation. "Gregarious adults" vary in size between 40 and 60 mm according to the sex. They are smaller than the solitary adults.

Kow Swamp archaeological site

The Kow Swamp archaeological site is on the eastern side of Kow Swamp in northern Victoria. A number of Pleistocene burials have been found in a sand dune, known as a lunette. Archaeologist Alan Thorne dug up the skeletons of more than 22 people between 1968 and 1972.
The discovery of human remains included skulls which appeared to be 'pre-sapiens', that is, earlier than modern man. Later studies did not confirm this.
Kow Swamp is named for an Aboriginal word, "Ghow", from the Yorta Yorta language. It means white gypsum soil which is found in the area. Kow Swamp is now a lake used to store irrigation water. It is 15 kilometres in circumference and about 3 metres deep. It was once a low lying swamp which only filled when the Murray River was in flood or running at high levels.
Australian aborigines have lived at Kow Swamp. There are canoe trees where the bark has been taken from the tree to make a canoe. There are also middens, which are rubbish heaps with evidence of what people ate. Early European settlers described an Aboriginal ceremonial site on the north side of the swamp. In 1925 part of a skull was found on the west side of the swamp during digging works. It was called the "Cohuna Cranium". The editor of the local newspaper "Cohuna Farmers Weekly" notified authorities and the importance of the discovery was realised. In the 1960s, Alan Thorne also found an ancient bone in the collection at the Museum of Victoria, and traced the find spot to Kow Swamp. Archaeological excavations took place between 1968 and 1972 by Thorne for the Australian National University in Canberra. Further remains were found around the swamp by a local person, Gordon Spark. By 1972 the remains of at least forty individuals had been excavated and studied. These discoveries helped prove the wide range of Aboriginal genetic history. They have been used to show that there were different waves of immigrants to Australia before European discovery.
Radiocarbon dating has shown that most of the burials took place between 13,000 and 10,000 years ago. The youngest burial 6500 was about 6,500 years old. Optically stimulated luminesence (OSL) dating in 2003 showed the burials were between 22,000 and 19,000 years old. However, these dates have been questioned due to the difficulty of making sure the dated sand is the same age as the actual burials. Dating research on bones from other sites in the region such as Nacurrie and Coobool Creek, support the 13,000 to 9,000 date range for Kow Swamp.
At first the skulls from Kow Swamp were thought to be from "Homo erectus", not modern "Homo sapiens". Thorne believed that it showed "the survival of "Homo erectus" features in Australia until as recently as 10,000 years ago". However, Donald Brothwell disagreed and said size and shape of the skulls at Kow Swamp had been caused by artificial cranial deformation. 
The size and shape of the skulls are different from modern Aboriginal skulls. They are also different to Pleistocene remains found at Lake Mungo and Keilor. These differences have been used to suggest that different people came to Australia at different times in the past. However, more recent studies do not support this theory. Most of the skulls were in small fragments, and only two were reasonably complete.
Aboriginal community groups have asked for the human remains from Kow Swamp be returned from Australian and overseas museum collections. The Kow Swamp skeletons were returned to the area and reburied. Casts of some of the Kow Swamp skulls are held by the Archaeology and Human Sciences department at the Australian National University. Some casts are also at London Natural History Museum and other institutions.

Polyphenism

Polyphenism is a kind of polymorphism where different forms of an animal are caused a single genotype. The animal inherits the capability, but the environment determines which form develops. This contrasts with genetic polymorphism, where each morph (form) inherits a slightly different genome.
Polyphenism occurs when the animal inherits a developmental switch. The switch is sensitive to some environmental cue or trigger. For example, the sex of crocodiles is determined by the prevailing temperature. Their gender is a polyphenic trait, and is not determined by the usual sex linkage.
The caste system of social insects is the division of labor between genetically identical individuals. Polyphenism determines whether larvae develop into queens, workers, and in some cases soldiers. In the case of the ant, "P. morrisi", an embryo must develop under certain temperature and photoperiod conditions in order to become a reproductively-active queen. This allows for control of the mating season, but like sex determination, limits the spread of the species into certain climates.
In bees, "royal jelly" provided by worker bees causes a larva to become a queen. Royal jelly is only produced when the queen is aging or has died.
Polyphenic pigmentation is adaptive for species which reproduce several times a year. Different pigment patterns provide camouflage throughout the seasons, and alter heat retention as temperatures change. Because insects cease growth and development after they are adults, their pigment pattern is set in adulthood. In the case of the peppered moth, "Biston betularia", the caterpillars are polyphenic. Their trigger is switched by the colour of the plants they are eating: see "this".

Mount Unapproachable

Mount Unapproachable is a mountain in the southwest of the Northern Territory, Australia. It is on the northern side of Lake Neale. It is about above sea level. The area is far apart from other towns. The nearest towns are Kaltukatjara (116 km away), Kintore (135 km away) and Yulara (138 km away). The mountain is mostly made of sandstone.
The mountain was named by explorer Ernest Giles in 1872. Giles was on an expedition to find a way across the desert from east to west. He had just found and named Lake Amadeus. He could see the mountain rising to the west, and hoped to find water there. But, he was unable to get to the mountain because his path was blocked by the lake. Giles in fact over-estimated the size of Lake Amadeus and missed the bridge of land between Amadeus and Lake Neale.
In 1889, Giles' second-in-command, W. H. Tietkins, came back on his own expedition and surveyed the area. He wrote that he travelled to the Bloods Range, to the south of Lakes Amadeus and Neale. He named the highest peaks Mount Harris and Mount Carruthers. From the top of Mount Harris, he could see Kata Tjuṯa, the Petermann Ranges and the Tomkinson Ranges. Tietkins then travelled to the east for three days, and came to Lake Amadeus. At the western end of the lake and on the north shore, he described a sandstone range, which he named Long's Range after his brother-in-law. He climbed a nearby set of hills, and identified Mount Unapproachable as the westernmost peak of the Long's Range. He reported that his team reached Unapproachable around the middle of June and then spent several days travelling around the western edge of Lake Amadeus. He corrected Giles' earlier mistake and successfully mapped the lake's western shore.
Another team of surveyors visited the area in 1926, led by Donald Mackay and Herbet Basedow. On 1 July, they climbed a hill that Basedow identified as both Mount Unapproachable and Mount Harris. He found them to be the same mountain after comparing his own observations with those of Giles and Tietkens. Basedow decided that this hill was the Mount Unapproachable that Giles had described, and that Tietkens had mistakenly renamed it Mount Harris. But, on modern maps, Mount Harris and Mount Carruthers are the names given to two peaks in the Bloods Range.

Van Wagenen House

The Van Wagenen House is a house in Jersey City, New Jersey. It is also known as the Apple Tree House. It has been part of the National Register of Historic Places since August 16, 2006.
The main part of the house was built in the 1740s, and an addition was made to it in the 1820s. A legend states that during the American Revolutionary War, General George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette talked about war strategy under an apple tree in front of the house in 1779. However, this is probably not true. There used to be an apple orchard and a cider press at the house, which is why it is also called the Apple Tree House.
The house was called one of the most endangered (which means it is at a very high risk of being ruined) historic sites by Preservation New Jersey in 1996. The building really needed to be improved (made better). In 1999 the City of Jersey City bought the house and started to make it better. The city plans to use the house as a museum.

<doc id="391861" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=391861" title="Brachylophosaurus">
Brachylophosaurus

Brachylophosaurus was a mid-sized herbivorous dinosaur, a member of the hadrosaur family. It is known from several skeletons and bonebed material from the Judith River Formation of Montana and the Oldman Formation of Alberta. They lived about 76.5 million years ago.
This animal had a bony crest, a flat, paddle-like plate over the top of the skull. Some individuals had crests that covered nearly the entire skull roof, while others had shorter, narrower crests. Other notable features are the unusually long forelimbs and the beak of the upper jaw being wider than other contemporary hadrosaurs.
Otherwise, "Brachylophosaurus" was a typical hadrosaur. It reached an adult length of 9 meters (30 ft). Like other hadrosaurs, "Brachylophosaurus" had cheeks to keep food in the mouth while it chewed with its hundreds of close-fitting teeth. These teeth could be used to chew efficiently, a feature rare among reptiles, but common among ornithischia like "Brachylophosaurus".
In 2003, evidence of tumors, including metastatic cancer, was discovered in fossilized "Brachylophosaurus" skeletons. Rothschild and co-workers tested dinosaur vertebrae for tumors using computerized tomography and fluoroscope screening. Several other hadrosaurs, including "Edmontosaurus", "Gilmoreosaurus", and "Bactrosaurus", also tested positive. Although more than 10,000 fossils were examined in this manner, the tumors were limited to "Brachylophosaurus" and closely related genera. The reason for this is not known.
In 1994, amateur paleontologist Nate Murphy discovered an immaculate, complete and uncrushed brachylophosaur skeleton which he nicknamed "Elvis". More impressive finds lay ahead for Murphy and his team from the Judith River Dinosaur Institute. In 2000, "Leonardo", a fully articulated and partially mummified skeleton of a young adult brachylophosaur, was discovered. It is considered one of the most spectacular dinosaur finds ever, and was included in the "Guinness Book of World Records". They subsequently excavated "Roberta", an almost complete slender skeleton, and "Peanut", a partially preserved juvenile with some skin impressions.

<doc id="391890" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=391890" title="Ketogenic diet">
Ketogenic diet

A ketogenic diet is a diet that derives most of its calories from fat and only a small number of calories from carbohydrates. 
The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates for energy. Normally, the carbohydrates you eat are turned into glucose in the body, which is used for energy around the body and in the brain. But, if you don't eat enough carbohydrates, your body has a back-up system of burning fat instead. The liver can use stored fat and the fat you eat for energy. Stored fat is broken into two parts, fatty acids, and ketone bodies. Ketone bodies power the brain instead of glucose. This state of having a lot of ketone bodies in your blood is called "Ketosis."
The regular ketogenic diet has two to four times more fat by weight than protein, and very little carbohydrates every day. This means not eating foods that are made from starch or sugar. High-carbohydrate foods are foods like fruits, bread, pasta, grains, cookies, and ice cream. Also, you have to increase your intake of fatty foods, like oils, butter, and fatty meats. It's also important to not eat too much protein. You should only eat just enough protein so you don't lose muscles. Too much protein reduces the ketone bodies in your blood and blocks fat burning. 
A ketogenic diet can be good for losing weight for most people, and is very good for treating seizures. A popular diet similar to the ketogenic diet is the Atkins Diet. Ketogenic diets have not been studied as much as regular diets, so we do not have as much information about them at this point. Compared to the diet that the American government suggests we should eat, there is a lot more fat and a lot less carbohydrate. Some people think this is a healthier way to live since you are eating less sugar, and the fat you eat can be used for energy right away, instead of being stored as body fat.
A ketogenic diet helps to stop seizures in children and can help people lose weight.

John Connally

John Bowden Connally, Jr. (February 27, 1917 – June 15, 1993), was an American politician. He served as the 39th Governor of Texas, Secretary of the Navy under John F. Kennedy, and Secretary of Treasury under Richard Nixon. While he was Governor of Texas in 1963, Connally was a passenger in the car where President Kennedy was assassinated, and he was seriously wounded during the shooting.
Connally was born in Floresville, Texas, near San Antonio. He is one of the seven children born to Lela (née Wright) and John Bowden Connally, Sr., a dairy and tenant farmer.
While Connally attended Floresville High School, he was one of the graduates who attended college. He graduated from the University of Texas at Austin. At University of Texas at Austin, he was the student body president and a member of the Friar Society. He subsequently graduated from the University of Texas School of Law and was admitted to the examination bar.
Connally served in the United States Navy during World War II, first as an assistant to James V. Forrestal. Then, he served again as part of the planning staff for the invasion of North Africa by General Dwight D. Eisenhower. He transferred to the South Pacific Theater, where he served with distinction. He was a fighter-plane director aboard the aircraft carrier USS "Essex" and won a Bronze Star for bravery. He was shifted to another Essex class aircraft carrier which was the USS "Bennington". He won a Legion of Merit. He was also involved in the military campaigns in the Gilbert, Marshall, Ryukyu, and Philippine islands. He quit the military in 1946 at the rank of lieutenant commander.
After he was released from the navy, Connally practiced law in the Alvin Wirtz law firm. He quit practicing law when Lyndon B. Johnson, who was a newly elected senator, persuaded him to return to Washington, D.C. to serve as a key assistant. He had close relations with Johnson before he started his navy career and kept them till Johnson's death in 1973.
Connally's main legal customers were the Texas oil wealthy person, Sid W. Richardson and Perry Bass, who was Richardson's nephew and partner, both of Fort Worth. Richardson's family dynasty business at the time was estimated at $200 million to $1 billion. Under Richardson's custody, Connally had experience in many enterprises and received tips on real estate purchases. The work required the Connallys to relocate to Fort Worth. When Richardson died in 1959, Connally was named as the profitable position of co-executor of the estate.
Connally served as Governor of Texas from 1963–1969. In the campaigns of 1964 and 1966, Connally defeated Republicans, Jack Crichton, a Dallas oil industrialist, and Thomas Everton Kennerly, Sr. (1903–2000), of Houston, respectively. He won with margins of 73.8 percent and 72.8 percent, respectively, giving him greater influence with the most of the legistlature being Democratic.
Connally was governor during a time of great expansion of higher education in Texas. He signed into law the creation of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. He appointed members of a governing body who backed the entry of women into previously male Texas A&M University in College Station, having been prompted to take such action by State Senator William T. "Bill" Moore of Bryan, who had first proposed the admission of women to the university in 1953.
On November 22, 1963, Connally was seriously wounded while riding in President Kennedy's car at Dealey Plaza in Dallas when the president was assassinated. He recovered from wounds in his chest, wrist and thigh. The ten-month investigation by the Warren Commission of 1963–1964 concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. Connally did not dispute this conclusion but did for the rest of his life question the single bullet theory. In 1966, he told the press, "I am convinced beyond any doubt that I was not struck by the first bullet," and added, "but just because I disagree with the Warren Commission on this one finding does not mean I disagree with their over-all findings."
Connally died on April 15, 1993 in Houston, Texas from pulmonary fibrosis, aged 76. When Connally died, forensic pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht and the Assassination Archives and Research Center petitioned Attorney General Janet Reno to recover the remaining bullet fragments from Connally's body, contending that the fragments would disprove the Warren Commission's single-bullet, single-gunman conclusion. The Justice Department replied that it "...would have no legal authority to recover the fragments unless Connally's family gave [it] permission." Connally's family refused permission.

Space Exploration Technologies Corporation

Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or more commonly SpaceX is a space transport company based in Hawthorne, California. It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, who also founded PayPal. It has developed rockets that can lift cargo into space, fly it to the International Space Station (ISS), and safely return cargo back to Earth. In December of 2010, it became the first private company to successfully launch, orbit and recover a spacecraft. In May of 2012 
it was the first private company to send a cargo to the ISS, and it returned. It is planning to take astronauts to the ISS in 2015. This is important, as the United States has had to use Soyuz spacecraft from Russia ever since NASA retired the Space Shuttle program.
Besides working for NASA, SpaceX will launch satellites for the military, private companies, and other countries. In 2009 it already launched a low earth orbiting satellite. The company plans to launch its first commercial satellite for geostationary orbit in 2013.
Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets were built to eventually become reusable. Rockets being reusable is good, because usually other rockets when they go to space burn up when coming back to earth too fast. If rockets can be reusable, that means that they spend less money making new rockets to replace the burned up ones, so rockets get cheaper. SpaceX also built the Dragon spacecraft. This is filled with equipment and supplies for the astronauts on the ISS. It is put on one of the Falcon rockets (because the Dragon does not have big enough rockets to fly to space on its own) and flown into orbit. From orbit it then uses its own smaller rockets to get to the ISS. Then it is filled back up with old equipment, the results of science experiments, and garbage, and parachutes back to Earth, landing in the ocean.
In order to control how much they have to pay for new rockets and how good their rockets will be, SpaceX designs, builds and tests and fabricates the most of its components inside SpaceX itself, not other companies. Usually, companies that build big machines like rockets buy parts from other companies who make and test things for them. Some things SpaceX has made by itself includes the Merlin, Kestrel, and Draco rocket engines used on the Falcon launch vehicles and the Dragon spacecraft. 
Future projects include the Falcon Heavy launch system, and a NASA robotic mission to Mars in 2018. The Falcon Heavy is a bigger rocket that is based on the Falcon 9, and if it goes as planned, it will be the most powerful rocket in America since the Apollo-era Saturn V. Falcon Heavy can be used to send a manned Dragon spacecraft on lunar orbiting missions – like the Apollo 8 mission; or be used to send a modified unmanned Dragon on a Mars landing mission. The Falcon Heavy is going to be made from three of the Falcon 9 rockets that have been changed a bit. This is so SpaceX can build rockets easier, because if they made the Falcon Heavy made of different types of rockets that would mean SpaceX would have to get different things to make the different rockets. Making it with the same kind of rocket means they can just use the same things to make the rocket, making rockets even cheaper.
Musk has stated that his intention for the company is to help in the creation of a permanent human presence on Mars.

Dysthymia

Dysthymia (also called dysthymic disorder or neurotic depression) is a type of mental illness called a mood disorder. People with dysthymia have depression that is mild to moderate and lasts for years.
Dysthymia is a chronic (long-lasting) condition. A person must have symptoms for at least two years to qualify for a diagnosis of dysthymia.
The symptoms of dysthymia and major depressive disorder are similar. Both disorders can have serious effects on the body, mind, and emotions. Physical symptoms can include changes in appetite, low energy, feeling tired, and trouble sleeping. Mental symptoms include difficulty making decisions or concentrating. Emotionally, people with either disorder often feel hopeless and have low self-esteem. However, even though both disorders have similar symptoms, these symptoms are usually less severe with dysthymia.
Like with major depressive disorder, people with dysthymia may think about suicide or try to kill themselves. Dysthymia does not involve mania, hypomania (mild forms of mania), or mixed episodes (where a person has symptoms of both depression and mania).
Sometimes, people with dysthymia have "double depression." This happens when a person with dysthymia has episodes of major depression (where their depression gets much worse) on top of their existing dysthymia.
Dysthymia usually affects adults, though it can affect teenagers. People who are diagnosed early (before age 22) usually have more severe relapses (where they return to being dysthymic after having been healthy), and are more likely to have other mental illnesses along with their dysthymia.

Lake Maurice

Lake Maurice (also known as Carle Thulka) is a salt lake in South Australia. It is the largest of many salt lakes in the eastern end of the Great Victoria Desert. It is normally dry, except during and after periods of heavy rainfall. When it is full, the lake covers an area of around . It is part of the geological basin known as the Officer Basin. The smaller Lake Dey Dey is to the north. Since 1985, Lake Maurice is part of the lands belonging to the Maralinga Tjarutja, a southern branch of the Pitjantjatjara. The community of Oak Valley is near the western shore of the lake.
The exposed surface of the lake normally consists of dry clay, silt or sand, covered with a salty crust. The area around Lake Maurice is very dry. Two wells have been drilled to the southeast and northwest of Lake Maurice, to search for uranium and other minerals. Both wells yield very low levels of groundwater. The water contains high levels of salt. It has also been found to contain radium and sediments from the Cambrian era.
The lake is named after the explorer Richard Maurice. Maurice went on at least eight expeditions to the Great Victoria Desert between 1897 and 1903. He was not the first European to pass through this region: Ernest Giles and his team had explored the area almost 20 years before. Giles saw the lake in 1875, but he did not give it a name. He described the area as barren, and wrote that he and his team found no game between Lake Maurice and the Western Australian border. Maurice, in his own expeditions, recorded information and collected specimens on the plants, animals and geology of the area. In 1904, a mining surveyor named Frank George led a prospecting expedition through this region. He used Maurice's camels and equipment and travelled northwest of Lake Dey Dey and across the border to the salt lakes in Western Australia. George named Lake Maurice, and he reported that the area was not likely to contain anything suitable for mining.
The area around Lake Maurice was affected by the nuclear-weapon tests done during the 1950s. Dozens of Aboriginal families were removed from their ancestral lands and settled in towns far to the north (Ernabella), south (Yalata and Ooldea) and west (Cundeelee and Warburton). In the late 1940s, a single officer, Walter MacDougall, was sent to warn people in the area of the coming tests. The fallout from the hydrogen bombs was expected to harm or kill anyone within range. Officially, all were forced to leave their lands and were not allowed within 200 km of ground zero. Given that only one officer and an assistant were assigned to warn the people who lived across this huge area, many of the people were never informed, nor did they leave the area. Planes dropped information leaflets across the area, but the natives could not read the leaflets and were wary or afraid of the aircraft.

Serpentine Lakes

The Serpentine Lakes is a chain of salt lakes in the Great Victoria Desert of Australia. It runs for almost along the border between South Australia and Western Australia. When full, the lakes cover an area of . Most of it is located in the Mamungari Conservation Park. The Anne Beadell Highway crosses the northernmost arm of the lake.
The Serpentine Lakes are considered an important wetlands area. They form part of a major palaeo-drainage system, an ancient and inactive drainage system from the Palaeozoic era. The surface of the lake normally consists of dry clay, silt and sand, and is covered with a salty crust. The sediment is mostly quartz arenite. The lakes form the main channel of the palaeo-drainage system. Other channels are covered by dunes and are not well defined.
Tektites high in magnesium have been found in these lakes.

Boeing 720

The Boeing 720 is a jet airliner. It has two rows of seats, which means that it is a narrow-body airliner. It has four engines. The Boeing 720 was designed by Boeing in the 1950s. It was based on the Boeing 707, but the 720 is shorter and cannot fly as far. The 720 first took off in November 1959. Airlines began to use it in July 1960.
Two versions of the plane were made. The first one had Pratt & Whitney JT3C turbojet engines and was first used in 1960. The second one is called the 720B, and it has Pratt & Whitney JT3D turbofan engines. It was first used in 1961. Some 720s were changed to 720Bs.
Only 154 Boeing 720s were built, but it still made Boeing a lot of money because it did not cost a lot to design. 
The Boeing 720 was replaced by the Boeing 727.
Boeing said it would make a new type of Boeing 707 in July 1957. At first, the new plane was called the "707-020", but it was changed to "720". The Boeing 720 is shorter than the Boeing 707.
The 720 had a lot of changes made to the outside of the plane. These changes helped the 720 fly faster than the 707−120. It had four Pratt & Whitney JT3C-7 turbojet engines. The engines made of thrust each.
At one point while the plane was being designed, it was called the "717-020". However, Boeing used the name "717" for a military jet, but this was changed to the MD-95 after Boeing bought McDonnell Douglas in 1997.
Since the plane was so similar to the Boeing 707, no prototype Boeing 720 was needed. Any new systems were tested on the Boeing 367-80. The first 720 took off on November 23, 1959. It was first used by United Airlines, on July 5, 1960. 65 720s were made.
The "720B" was a different type of 720. It had JT3D turbofan engines. These engines made of thrust each. The JT3D engines burned less fuel and could make more thrust. The first 720B took off on October 6, 1960. The first airline to use it was American Airlines in March 1961. 89 720Bs were made. American Airlines also changed some of their normal 720s to 720Bs.
Since the Boeing 720 was so similar to the Boeing 707, it did not cost much to design. This meant that it still earned Boeing money, even though not many planes were sold. Boeing made 154 Boeing 720s and 720Bs from 1959 until 1967. 
Although the Boeing 720 was similar to the Boeing 707-120, it was 9 ft (2.73 m) shorter. It was also lighter.
The 707 had emergency exits over the wings. These are called over-wing emergency exits. The back over-wing exit was removed. Two extra over-wing exits could be put in so that the plane could hold more passengers.
The 720's wing was taken from the 707, but some changes were made to it. The 720 had the same wingspan as the 707-120. For the 720, the wing had something called a wing root glove. This glove helped the wing make less drag. 
Although the 720 first had turbojet engines, the Pratt & Whitney JT3D was much more popular. The JT3D was a turbofan engine. 720s which had the JT3D were called 720Bs. American Airlines changed some of their normal 720s to 720Bs.
The 720 used the engines to make air to pressurize the cabin. However, the engines could not make enough air to do this, so some small holes were put in above the engines for more air.
The Boeing 720 did not have an APU, so it needed power from the ground to power the plane until the engines were started (the engines could make electricity for the plane). 
The first Boeing 720 was for United Airlines. It first flew on November 23, 1959. United Airlines first used the plane on July 5, 1960. It flew from Los Angeles to Denver and then Chicago. American Airlines was the second airline to use the 720. The Boeing 720 was replaced by the Boeing 727 during the 1960s.
The first 720 had its name changed to "The Starship". It was turned into a private plane used by rock bands. Led Zeppelin used it most, in the 1970s. A bar was put in, as well as beds, a shower, a lounge area, a TV and video cassette player. 
Honeywell used the last Boeing 720 in the United States. It flew from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Honeywell used it for testing. Honeywell got rid of this plane on June 21 and 22, 2008. Honeywell replaced their Boeing 720 with a Boeing 757.
Pratt & Whitney Canada used the last 720 until 2010. It was used to test new engines. Pratt & Whitney Canada it with a Boeing 747SP. In May 2012, flown to the National Air Force Museum of Canada. It can now be seen there.
These airlines got new Boeing 720/720Bs:
The Boeing 720 has had 23 hull-loss accidents. It has been hijacked nine times. One plane was destroyed by a bomb in 1976. People died in 12 of the hull-loss accidents. 256 people have died on Boeing 720s. The three worst accidents were:

Nicoya is a town in Costa Rica's Guanacaste Province. It is one of the most important tourist zones. It serves as a transport hub to Guanacaste's beaches and national parks. The town is also the capital of the "cantón" of the same name (Nicoya Canton).
The town was built in an old colonial style. It was built in the Cordillera Volcánica de Guanacaste. Agriculture and cattle are the town's main economic activity.
In early 2006, a group of researchers led by adventure writer Dan Buettner and supported by National Geographic Magazine, the National Institute for Aging, and Alliance Healthcare, designated Nicoya as a Blue Zone. This designation is granted to global regions that are characterized by the longest life expectancies. Among the ideal Nicoyan lifestyle characteristics cited by the research were the water’s high calcium content, intense daily physical activity, year-long fruit consumption, and close inter-generational relationships.
While the town elected 61 year old Lorenzo Rosales Vargas as mayor on December 3, 2006 he was only able to serve for about a year before quitting due to health reasons. Since May 5, 2008 Eduardo Gutiérrez Rosales has been holding the office instead as Nicoya's first supply mayor. They are both members of the National Liberation Party (PLN).

Lens (optics)

A lens is a clear (transparent) object (like glass, plastic or even a drop of water) that changes the way things look by bending the light that goes through it. They may make things appear larger, smaller, or upside-down. Some places lenses are used include spectacles (eyeglasses), contact lenses, cameras, projectors, microscopes, telescopes, magnifying glasses, etc. Each eye also has a lens. 
They work by refraction, or the bending of light.
Lenses have three main shapes. Each different shape changes the image (making it bigger or smaller). The three types are:
The word "lens" comes from the Latin word for "lentil," because the earliest convex lenses in common use were shaped like the bean.
The oldest written record of lenses is in the ancient Greek play by Aristophanes called "Clouds", where lenses were used with sunlight to make fire.
Galileo Galilei is commonly believed to have used lenses to make the first known refracting telescope. However, he merely adapted and improved a design he learned from Dutch lensmakers such as Hans Lippershey. He was probably the first to use telescopes to make accurate astronomical observations, though.

When payment is made with credit card, sellers pay small percentage of the transaction to their bank or merchant. Many credit card companies, especially those in the United Kingdom and United States, share the commission with the owner of card by giving him money bonus, points that can be exchange for prizes and discounts once some level of purchases is reached. A monetary benefit is known as cashback, sometimes pronounced as two separate words in the United States - (cash back). Usual cashback amount is between 0.5% and 2% of buyers net spending (purchases minus refunds and tax) as a yearly bonus, which is either added to the credit card account or paid by cheque, cash or wire to the participant.
Recently, major card issuers have increased cashback amount to 5% for purchases especially in grocery stores and petrol stations.
In most cases bonuses like cashback are offered to customers that pay off their credit debt on time every month.

Pit Corder (6 October 1918 - 27 January 1990) was a professor of linguistics at the University of Edinburgh. His important work was studying errors that language learners make. This is called error analysis. He was the first chairman of the British Association for Applied Linguistics, 1967-70.
Pit Corder was born at 4 Bootham Terrace, York, into a Quaker family. His full name was Stephen Pit Corder. His father, Philip Corder (b. 1885), was a schoolteacher from an English family, and his mother, Johanna Adriana van der Mersch (b. 1887), was Dutch. Pit studied at Bootham School, a Quaker boarding school near York. His father was a master at the school. Corder studied modern languages at Merton College, Oxford University, from 1936 to 1939.
After Oxford, Corder began teaching at Great Ayton Friends' School. Then, during World War II, he was in the Friends' Ambulance Unit in Finland and Egypt. He did not have to be a soldier because he was a conscientious objector. In 1946 Corder married Nancy Proctor (b. 1916), his second cousin. They had two sons and a daughter.
After the war, Corder worked for the British Council in Austria, Turkey, Jamaica and Colombia. During this time he taught classes, worked on syllabus design, and prepared new language-teaching materials. In 1957 Corder joined the school of applied linguistics at the University of Edinburgh. However, he still worked for the British Council at the same time. The British Council needed specialists in applied linguistics because it was expanding language teaching programs around the world. Corder studied for the diploma in applied linguistics to help the Council. He taught at Edinburgh University for over twenty years until he retired in 1983.

In this methodology, learners should be exposed to a lot of language. The approach also says that lowering affective or emotional barriers to learning is important.
Tracy D. Terrell graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a PhD. in linguistics. He became an important American Hispanist and theoretical linguist. He taught at the University of California, Irvine from 1970 until 1985. Then, he took a job in the linguistics department at the at the University of California, San Diego. He retired in 1989, and finally died of AIDS in 1991. Along with Stephen Krashen, he developed the “Natural Approach” to second language learning. This was a popular way of teaching second languages.

In this case, the Chancellor might not even live close to the University or take part in meetings there. For example, at the University of Cambridge the chancellor is a person who has done something important in his life, and is in some way connected to the University. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was the Chancellor at Cambridge for 36 years.
The vice-chancellor of a university is instead the chief executive. He/She is the one that makes all the decisions, goes at regular meetings and has the day-to-day duties to do. The vice-chancellor is often very closely linked to the University: for example, he/she might be a fellow there, who decides to take on additional responsibilities. The vice-chancellor might also represent the university at important events if the chancellor is not available.

White-headed capuchin

The white-headed capuchin ("Cebus capucinus") is a medium-sized New World monkey of the family Cebidae, subfamily Cebinae. It is also known as the white-faced capuchin or the white-throated capuchin. It comes from the forests of Central America. It also lives in the extreme northwestern part of South America. The white-headed Capuchin is important to rain forests because of its role in dispersing seeds and pollen. 
In recent years the species has become popular in North American media. It is a very intelligent monkey and has been trained to assist paraplegic people. 
The monkey is medium-sized. It can weigh up to . The color is mostly black but they have a pink face. They also have white on the front part of the body. It has a distinctive prehensile tail that is coiled up and is used to help support the monkey on a branch.
In the wild, the white-headed capuchin can live in many different types of forest. They can eat many different types of food, like fruit, other plants, insects, and small vertebrates. It lives in troops (groups) that can have more than 20 animals, both males and females. It is noted for its tool use. They can rub plants over their fur in using herbal medicine. They can also use tools as weapons and for getting food. The monkey has a maximum recorded age of over 54 years.
The white-headed Capuchin was originally described by Carolus Linnaeus in his 18th century work, "Systema Naturae". It is a member of the family Cebidae. It is part of the family of New World monkeys containing capuchin monkeys, squirrel monkeys, tamarins and marmosets. It is part of the genus "Cebus". It is part of the "C. capucinus" species group. This group also includes the white-fronted capuchin, the weeper capuchin and the Kaapori capuchin.
Some scientists think there are three subspecies of white-headed Capuchin:
But other scientists do not recognize any separate subspecies.
Like other monkeys of the "Cebus" group, the white-headed Capuchin is named after the order of Capuchin friars – the cowls worn by these friars looks like the monkey's white fur.
The white-headed Capuchin has mostly black fur. It has white or yellow fur on the neck, throat, chest, shoulders, and upper arms. The face is pink or a white-cream color. The face can sometimes have marks like dark brows or dark fur patches. There is also an area of black fur on the top of the head.
Adult monkeys can reach a length of between , excluding the tail. They can weight of up to . The tail is longer than the body. It can be as long as . Males are about 27% larger than females. The brain of a white-headed Capuchin is about . It is larger than that of other large monkey species like the Mantled Howler.
The white-headed capuchin is a diurnal and arboreal animal. However, it does come down to the ground more often than many other New World monkeys. It moves primarily by walking on all four limbs. It
lives in troops, or groups, of up to 40 monkeys (mean 16, range 4–40) and has a male/female adult sex ratio of 0.71 on average (range 0.54–0.88). With rare exceptions, females spend their entire lives with their female kin. Males migrate to new social groups multiple times during the course of their lifetimes, migrating for the first time between 20 months and 11 years of age. The median age of migration in the Santa Rosa population is 4.5 years. Males sometimes migrate alone, but more often they migrate in the company of other males who are often their kin. One of the unusual features of the kinship structure of the white-headed capuchin, relative to other primate species, is the high degree of relatedness within groups that results from the long tenures of alpha males who sire most of the offspring. Alpha males have been known to keep their positions as long as 17 years in this species and this puts them in the unusual position of being available to sire the offspring of their daughters and granddaughters, who produce their first offspring at about 6–7 years of age. Typically, however, alpha males do not breed with their own daughters, even though they do sire virtually all offspring produced by females unrelated to them. Those subordinate males who are allies of the alpha male in group defense are the males who sire the offspring of the alpha male's daughters. The high degree to which alpha males monopolize matings results in an unusually large number of paternal half-siblings and full siblings in this species relative to other primate species.
Kinship is an important organizing factor in the structuring of female-female social relationships. Particularly in larger groups, females preferentially associate with, groom, and provide coalitionary support to their matrilineally related female kin. They do not exhibit a similar preference for their paternal half sisters, which may mean that they only are capable of recognizing kinship through the maternal line. Dominance rank is also an important organizing factor, with females more often grooming and associating with females who are closer to them in the dominance hierarchy. Female-female dyads groom far more than male-female and male-male dyads. Coalitionary aggression is common both among males and females, and capuchins seem to have an excellent understanding of the alliance structure in their group. For example, when capuchins are fighting, they sensibly recruit aid from someone who is both higher ranking than they are and also better friends with themselves than with their opponent.
Female capuchins have linear dominance hierarchies. In contrast to many Old World monkeys such as macaques, in which females socially inherit the rank just below their mothers and just above their next oldest sisters, capuchins do not have a highly predictable ranking within their matrilines. Males are typically dominant to females. The alpha male is always easy to discern, but there are sometimes ambiguous rankings among subordinate males. Male-male relationships are tense, and affiliation between males is typically expressed by resting in contact, playing, or non-conceptive sex rather than by grooming. Males cooperate in coalitions against potential predators, and also in defense of the group against other males. Occasionally male coalitionary aggression becomes so violent that males are killed, particularly if they are encountered roaming the forest unaccompanied by allies. Because aggression from other male capuchins is the leading cause of death (aside from poaching by humans, where there is contact between humans and capuchins), male allies are critical for self-defense during migration, and to assist in taking over other groups. Male emigration to a new troop typically occurs about every 4 years, so most males are in constant danger of having to defend themselves against other groups of males. 
Immigrating males often kill young infants when they take over a group. Females band together to defend their infants from infanticidal males, but they rarely succeed in saving their infants. Because infants inhibit their mothers from ovulating by nursing frequently, males are able to bring females into estrus earlier by killing the infants and thereby terminating nursing; this has the effect of increasing their breeding opportunities. Females do often mate with the killers of their infants, and with time, they typically become as supportive of the new alpha male as they had been of the previous one. The alpha male helps defend females from subordinate males within the group as well as from infanticidal males from other groups.
White-faced capuchin troops occupy home ranges of between . They travel between daily, averaging per day. Although they engage in activity that has been described as "territorial", more recent research indicates that White-faced capuchin troops tend to behave aggressively to other White-faced capuchin troops regardless of where they meet, and the aggression is not necessarily intended to exclude the other troops from a specific home range. 
Home ranges overlap extensively, so groups are not territorial in the strictest sense of the word. Perhaps because of the intensity of male-male competition and the threat of infanticide, interactions between groups are typically hostile: the males display aggressively toward one another and sometimes engage in physical aggression (even killing an opponent), while females grab their infants and run. Typically, males are the primary participants in aggressive intergroup encounters, and it seems likely that males are defending access to the females in their groups. Alpha males, who have the largest reproductive stake in the group, participate at a higher rate than subordinate males. Groups with more males have an advantage over groups with fewer males, but the location of the encounter within the home range matters as well; smaller groups defeat larger groups when the contest occurs in the core or center area of the smaller group's home range.
The white-headed capuchin sometimes interacts with other sympatric monkey species. White-headed capuchins sometimes travel with and even groom Geoffroy's Spider Monkeys. However, aggressive interactions between the capuchins and spider monkeys also occur. Interactions between the white-headed capuchin and mantled howler are infrequent, and sometimes result in the capuchins threatening the larger howlers. However, affiliative associations between the capuchins and howlers do sometimes occur, mostly involving juveniles playing together. 
Although South American capuchin species often travel with and feed together with squirrel monkeys, the white-headed capuchin only rarely associates with the Central American squirrel monkey. This appears to be related to the patchier, more dispersed distribution of food resources in Central America and the fact that there is less dietary overlap between the Central American squirrel monkey and the white-headed capuchin than between their South American counterparts. Therefore, there is less benefit to the Central American squirrel monkey in associating with the white-headed capuchin in order to exploit the capuchin's knowledge of food resource distribution. In addition, compared to their South American counterparts, male white-headed capuchins are relatively more alert to rival males than to predators, reducing the predator detection benefits that the Central American squirrel monkey receives from associating with the white-headed capuchin compared to its South American counterparts. Since the squirrel monkeys generally initiate interactions with the capuchins in South America, the fact that similar associations would impose higher foraging costs and impart fewer predator detection benefits to the Central American squirrel monkey leads to fewer associations with the white-headed capuchin.
Several non-primate animal species tend to follow troops of White-faced Monkeys or are otherwise attracted by their presence. white-lipped peccaries and common agoutis are attracted by feeding white-headed capuchins, looking for fruit that the capuchins drop. Several species of bird are also known to follow white-headed capuchins looking for food. These include the double-toothed kite, the white hawk and the sharp-shinned hawk.
The white-headed capuchin is an omnivore. Its primary foods are fruit and insects. It forages at all levels of the forest, and also forages on the ground. Methods for finding food include stripping bark off of trees, searching through leaf litter, breaking dead tree branches, rolling over rocks, and using stones as anvils to crack hard fruits. Its prehensile tail assists with feeding, helping support the monkey when foraging for food below the branches.
Fruit can make up between 50% and 67% or more of the capuchin's diet. In one study in Panama, white-headed capuchins ate 95 different fruit species. Among its favorite fruits are figs from the family Moraceae, mangos and related fruits from the family Anacardiaceae, the bean-like fruits from the family Leguminosae and fruits from the family Rubiaceae. It generally only eats ripe fruit, testing for ripeness by smelling, tasting and prodding the fruit. It typically eats only the pulp and juice, spitting out the seeds and fibers. Other plant matter eaten includes flowers, young leaves, seeds of certain plants, and bromeliads. It also uses the bromelids as a water source, drinking the water that gets trapped inside. In Carara National Park the capuchins have a varied diet in addition to the above of banana fruits and flowers, heliconia seeds, huevos de caballo fruits and anacardiaceae stems. 
Insect prey eaten includes beetle larvae, butterfly and moth caterpillars, ants, wasps, and ant and wasp larvae. It also eats larger prey, such as birds, bird eggs, frogs, lizards, crabs, mollusks and small mammals. The population in Guanacaste, Costa Rica in particular is noted for hunting squirrels, magpies, White-crowned Parrots and baby coatis. The amount of vertebrate prey eaten varies by troop. Even neighboring troops can show significant differences in their diets.
The diet can vary between the rainy and dry season. For example, in Guanacaste, Costa Rica the white-headed capuchin can eat a wide variety of fruits as well as caterpillars in the early rainy season (June to November). But during the dry season, only figs and a few other types of fruit are available. During the dry season, chitinous insects, ant and wasp larvae and vertebrates become a particularly important part of the white-headed capuchin's diet. Access to water can also become an issue during the dry season. The white-headed capuchin likes to drink daily, so in forests where water holes dry up during the dry season, there can be competition between troops over access to the remaining water holes.
Capuchins are considered among the most intelligent of the New World monkeys; they have been the subject of many studies on behaviour and intelligence. The capuchins' intelligence is thought to be an adaptation to support their feeding habits; they rely on ephemeral food sources which may be hard to find. In one particular study conducted in 2007, capuchins were found to be among the ten most intelligent primates, second to spider monkeys among New World monkeys.
The white-headed capuchin is known to rub parts of certain plants into their fur. Plants used in this manner include citrus fruits, vines of the genera "Piper" and "Clematis", monkey comb (genus "Sloanea"), dumb cane and custard apple. Ants and millipedes are also used in this way. It is not definitively known what this fur rubbing is for, but this may deter parasites such as ticks and insects, or it may serve as a fungicide or bactericide or anti-inflammatory agent. Alternatively, it may be a form of scent marking. 
The white-headed capuchin also uses tools in other ways. It has been known to beat snakes with sticks in order to protect itself or to get the snake to release an infant. In captivity, it has been known to use tools to get to food or to defend itself, and in one case a white-headed capuchin used a squirrel monkey as a projectile, hurling it at a human observer. It has been historically noted that the species is often able to recognize, and therefore avoid baited cage traps, and hidden net snares are often the only way to capture this monkey. Some populations also use trees or other hard surfaces as anvils in order to crack mollusks. And it sometimes uses sticks as probes to explore openings. 
Though the white-headed capuchin has perhaps the most extensive and most frequent tool use in comparison to the other gracile capuchins, its tool use is considerably inferior to that of robust capuchins, especially the tufted capuchin. Factors such as easier access to water and food may have to do with the white-headed capuchin's less extensive use of tools.
The white-headed capuchin's intelligence and ability to use tools allows them to be trained to assist paraplegics. Other species of capuchin monkeys are also trained in this manner. White-headed capuchins can also be trained for roles on television and movies, such as Marcel on the television series "Friends". They were also traditionally used as organ grinder monkeys.
The white-headed capuchin is noisy. Loud calls, such as barks and coughs, are used to communicate threat warnings, and softer calls, such as squeals, are used in intimate discourse. Different types of threats, such as a threat from a terrestrial animal versus a threat from a bird, invoke different vocalizations. Facial expressions and scent are also important to communication. It sometimes engages in a practice known as "urine washing", in which the monkey rubs urine on its feet. The exact purpose of this practice is unknown, but it may be a form of olfactory signal.
The white-headed Capuchin has a polygamous mating system. The male can mate with many females. The dominant male usually fathers most of the young. The dominant male is more likely to mate when the female is the most fertile. Dominant males avoid breeding with their own daughters who are members of the troop. This is rare among New World monkeys.
Mating takes about 2 minutes. The gestation period is 5 to 6 months. A single young is born. Twins can sometimes be born. Most births happen during the dry season. It is from December to April. The baby is carried on the mother's back for about 6 weeks. After 4 to 5 weeks the baby can get off from its mother's back for a short period of time. At 3 months it can move around by itself. Some babies will be mostly independent earlier. Weaning happens between 6 and 12 months. While the mother rests, the babies spend most of their time foraging or playing. They can do that on their own or with other babies. Capuchins engage in high levels of alloparenting, in which monkeys other than the mother help care for the infant. Males and females engage in alloparenting. 
Like other Capuchin monkeys, the white-headed Capuchin matures slowly. Sexual maturity is reached at 3 years. On average, females give birth for the first time at 7 years old and give birth every 26 months. Males reach maturity at 10 years old. The white-headed Capuchin has a long life span. The maximum recorded life span in captivity is over 54 years.
The white-headed Capuchin lives in Central America and a small part of South America. In Central America, its home includes Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. It has also been seen in eastern Guatemala and southern Belize, but these reports are unconfirmed. In South America the white-headed Capuchin lives in the extreme north-western part between the Pacific Ocean and the Andes Mountains in Colombia and Ecuador. It is among the most commonly seen monkeys in Central America's national parks, such as Manuel Antonio National Park, Corcovado National Park, Santa Rosa National Park and Soberania National Park.
It is very common in Costa Rica and Panama, but the monkey has been thrown out from Honduras and much of Nicaragua. Many Honduran Capuchin monkeys were captured and relocated to the island of Roatán, and many Nicaraguan Capuchin monkeys were captured and relocated to the island of Ometepe.
It is found in many different types of forest, including evergreen and deciduous forests, dry and moist forests, and mangrove and montane forests. The monkey appears to ilke primary or advanced secondary forests.

Deep brain stimulation

Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a surgery where doctors put wires that can carry corrective electric signals inside a patient's brain. Electronic equipment located outside the brain can then send signals to specific parts of the person's brain. DBS is used to treat many diseases. DBS has been used to treat pain disorder, Parkinson's disease, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Tourette syndrome. The Food and Drug Administration approved DBS as a treatment for tremors in 1997, for Parkinson's disease in 2002, Tourette syndrome in 1999, and dystonia in 2003. DBS is helpful for most patients but there can be serious complications and side effects.
Parkinson's disease is a neurological syndrome characterized by tremor, hypokinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. DBS does not cure Parkinson's, but it can help reduce symptoms and improve the patient’s life. DBS is only used for patients whose symptoms cannot be controlled with medications.
DBS was approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Parkinson's in 2002. DBS carries the risks of major surgery, with a complication rate related to the experience of the surgical team. The major complications include hemorrhage (1–2%) and infection (3–5%).
Deep brain stimulation has been used in a few patients to treat major depressive disorder(MDD). It is hard to find a good target in the brain for DBS because there are few patients that have had DBS for MDD.
A study of DBS for major depressive disorder and Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) looked at 23 patients — nine for OCD, seven for MDD, and one for both. It found that "about half the patients did show dramatic improvement" and that there were few side effects and complications.
DBS for treatment resistant depression can be as effective as antidepressants, but side effects and complications need to be watched. Common side effects for DBS for MDD include infection, headache, bad mood, and suicidal thoughts.
In 1999, DBS was approved for Tourette syndrome - an inherited neurological disorder. Deep brain stimulation is used to treat patients with severe Tourette syndrome when medication does not help the patient. Many patients have fewer symptoms after DBS. In some patients, the DBS is only put on one side of the brain. This can reduce symptoms and patients may have fewer side effects when the stimulation is only put on one side of the brain.
There are two places in the brain where the stimulation is placed. The stimulation is either put in the thalamus or the globus pallidus pars interna. The thalamus is a more common target for DBS, but both targets can reduce symptoms. The best target for treating Tourette Syndrome with DBS is not yet defined.
In 2012, a literature review showed some slowed onset of dementia and memory loss in six Alzheimer's disease patients who had DBS.
In August 2007, US scientists used DBS on a 38-year-old man who was in a coma for six years because of a head injury. The patient was able to wake up, open his eyes, and turn his head in response to talking. After more DBS, the patient could name objects and use his hands. He could also drink liquid and eat food by mouth. Although DBS has worked for some patients with head injuries, DBS may not work for every patient with serious head injury and/or coma.
DBS has been used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) The use of DBS for OCD is one of the most successful uses of DBS for any disease. It is not understood why DBS is so successful for OCD.
DBS is helpful for some patients, but other patients have side effects and complications. Patients may experience side effects of apathy, hallucinations, addiction to gambling, hypersexuality, cognitive problems, and depression. However, these may be temporary and related to correct placement and calibration of the stimulator. Some side effects can go away after some time.
Because the brain can move a little during surgery, there is the possibility that the electrodes can move out of place. This may cause more complications like personality changes. Electrode movement is easy to find using a CT scan.
There may also be complications of surgery, such as bleeding within the brain.
In an rare case, a patient with severe Tourette's Syndrome had very severe side effects and complications. The patient suffered from opisthotonus- when the muscles are contracted without the patient's control. The patient later died from other infections.

Tomkinson Ranges

The Tomkinson Ranges is a mountain range in the northwest corner of South Australia. The range consists of sandstone hills, surrounded by spinifex grasslands. Several rock holes are located in and around the hills.
The mountains were named after politician Samuel Tomkinson (1851–1900). The explorer William Gosse named them when he passed through the region in the early 1870s. Ernest Giles and his team reached the ranges shortly after, and set up a base here from which to explore the Gibson and Great Victoria Deserts. Numerous prospecting expeditions were made through the region until the 1930s.
Together with the Mann Ranges, the Tomkinson Ranges are an important part of the Pitjantjatjara homeland. The communities of Kalka and Pipalyatjara are located at the base of the mountains.

Petermann Ranges

The Petermann Ranges is a mountain range in central Australia. It spreads about across the border between Western Australia and the southwest corner of the Northern Territory. The highest point is above sea level. The ranges were formed about 550 million years ago, in an event called the Petermann Orogeny. They are made mostly of granite, sandstone and quartzite. The greater Petermann Ranges consist of several sections of ridges and hills. In the Northern Territory, these sections include the Dean, Mannanana, Ilyaralona, Curdie and Piultarana Ranges, the Pottoyu Hills, and several isolated mountains. In Western Australia, it includes the Hope and Dean Ranges.
The Petermann Ranges were given their name by the explorer Ernest Giles, who travelled through the area during March 1874.
The area is considered biologically important for Australia. An indigenous protected area, the Katiti-Petermann Indigenous Protected Area, has been proposed to conserve the ranges' ecosystem.

Peyote, also called mescal-button, is two species of the cactus genus Lophophora of plants in the family Cactaceae.
The most common plant, L. williamsii, grow in North America, mostly in Mexico, can be found in the Chihuahuan desert of southern Texas and northern Mexico. The size is about eight centimeters (three inches) wide and five centimeters (two inches) tall. It is mostly blue green in color, with pink to white flowers, growing in groups among scrub, in areas with limestone soil. L. diffusa grows only in a small area in central Mexico, the color is yellow green, with white to yellow flowers.
Peyote is probably most known as an illegal drug and have hallucinogenic effect, made by at least 28 different alkaloids, mostly mescaline. In many countries it is illegal to sell, use or posses both dried plant-material and living plants, but some places also give an exception from the law when used in religious rituals, such as by The Native American Church where it is used in a similar way as some Native American tribes, that likely have used peyote for at least 5,500 years. in their rituals.

Everard Ranges

The Everard Ranges is a mountain range in northern South Australia. It consists of low rounded granite hills, topped with bare rock. The rock is from the Palaeocene period, between 20 and 60 million years ago. The range is segmented, with several monoliths and bornhardts separated from the hills by valleys. The valleys are filled with scrub, and the range is surrounded by Tertiary plains. The plains around it are about 550 metres above sea level.
The Everard Ranges are part of the traditional homeland of the Yankunytjatjara people. However, today most of the people living in and around the area are Pitjantjatjara. There are several caves and overhangs with Aboriginal rock paintings. The community of Mimili is located in the east of the range, about 22 km east of the centre.
The Everard Ranges were named by Ernest Giles after Everard Park, a large cattle station that covered the eastern part of the range (it is now the community of Mimili).

The Basedow Range is a mountain range in the south of the Northern Territory, Australia. It is located on the northern side of the Lasseter Highway, in the section between the Luritja and Stuart Highways. The range consists of two ridges of deformed sedimentary rock. The western ridge makes up most of the range's mass, and is about 12 km long. A small gap separates it from the eastern ridge, which is about 5 km long and much lower in height. The highest peak is Mount Ebenezer (702 m), which is located near the east end of the western ridge.
The Basedow Range is about 204 km south of Alice Springs. It is entirely within the property of the Mount Ebenezer cattle station. The community of Imaṉpa is at the base of Mount Ebenezer on its southern side. To the west of the range is the Angas Downs Indigenous Protected Area.
The Basedow Range was named by the explorer W. H. Tietkens when he reached the area on 19 July 1889. He named it after Martin P. F. Basedow, a German politician from Adelaide.

The United Fruit Company was an American corporation. It dealt with tropical fruits, especially bananas. These fruits were grown on Central and South American plantations. They were sold in the United States and Europe. The company was created in 1899 from Minor C. Keith's banana-trading concerns with Andrew W. Preston's Boston Fruit Company. It grew in the early and mid-20th century. It controlled vast territories and transportation networks in Central America, the Caribbean coast of Colombia, Ecuador, and the West Indies. It competed with the Standard Fruit Company in the international banana trade. 
It maintained a monopoly in certain regions that came to be called banana republics.
It had a deep and long-lasting impact on the economy and politics of many Latin American countries. Critics often accused it of neocolonialism. They described it as the example of the influence of a multinational corporation on the internal politics of countries. After a period of financial decline, United Fruit merged with Eli M. Black's AMK in 1970 to become the United Brands Company. In 1984, Carl Lindner, Jr. transformed United Brands into the present-day Chiquita Brands International.

<doc id="392242" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=392242" title="First-move advantage">
First-move advantage

The first-move advantage in chess is the advantage of the player (White) who makes the first move in chess. Statistics of results on chess databases include almost all published games since 1851. In all forms of statistics, White scores better than Black for the main four opening moves 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.c4 and 1.Nf3.
White's overall winning percentage is calculated by taking the percentage of games won by White plus half the percentage of drawn games. Thus, if out of 100 games White wins 40, draws 32, and loses 28, White's total winning percentage is 40 plus half of 32, i.e. 56 percent. It is about the same for tournament games between humans and games between computers. White's advantage is less significant in rapid games or novice games.
Since about 1889, when World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz addressed this issue, the overwhelming consensus has been that a perfectly played game would end in a draw. 
Recent sources indicate that White scores about 54 to 56 percent. In 2005, GM Jonathan Rowson wrote that "the conventional wisdom is that White begins the game with a small advantage and, holding all other factors constant, scores approximately 56% to Black's 44%". International Master (IM) John Watson wrote in 1998 that White had scored 56% for most of the 20th century, but that this figure had recently slipped to 55%. The website ChessGames.com holds regularly updated statistics on its games database. On March 17, 2008 the database contained 
460,703 games. White won 36.81%, 36.50% were drawn, and Black won 26.69%, resulting in a total White winning percentage of 55.06%.
New In Chess observed in its 2000 Yearbook that of the 731,740 games in its database, White scored 54.8% overall; with the two most popular opening moves, White scored 54.1% in 349,855 games beginning 1.e4, and 56.1% in 296,200 games beginning 1.d4. The main reason that 1.e4 was less effective than 1.d4 was the Sicilian defence (1.e4 c5), which gave White only a 52.3% score in 145,996 games.
Chess Engines Grand Tournament (CEGT) tests computer chess engines by playing them against each other, with time controls of forty moves in one hundred and twenty minutes per player (40/120), and also 40/20 and 40/4, and uses the results of those games to compile a rating list for each time control. At the slowest time control (40/120), White has scored 55.4% (W34.7 D41.3 L24.0) in games played among 38 of the strongest chess engines (as of May 27, 2009). At 40/20, White has scored 54.6% (W37.0 D35.2 L27.8) in games played among 284 engines (as of May 24, 2009). At the fastest time control (40/4), White has scored 54.8% (W39.6 D30.5 L30.0), in games played among 128 programs (as of May 28, 2009).
Joseph Bertin wrote in his 1735 textbook "The Noble Game of Chess", "He that plays first, is understood to have the attack". This is consistent with the traditional view that White, by virtue of the first move, begins with the initiative and should try to extend it into the middlegame, while Black should strive to neutralize White's initiative and attain equality. Because White begins with the initiative, a minor mistake by White generally leads only to loss of the initiative, while a similar mistake by Black may have more serious consequences. Thus, Sveshnikov wrote in 1994, "Black players cannot afford to make even the slightest mistake ... from a theoretical point of view, the tasks of White and Black in chess are different: White has to strive for a win, Black for a draw!"
The view that a game of chess should end in a draw given best play prevails. Even if it cannot be proved, this assumption is considered "safe" by Rowson and "logical" by Adorján. Watson agrees that "the proper result of a perfectly played chess game ... is a draw. ... Of course, I can't prove this, but I doubt that you can find a single strong player who would disagree. ... I remember Kasparov, after a last-round draw, explaining to the waiting reporters: 'Well, chess is a draw' ". World Champion Bobby Fischer thought that was almost definitely so.
Modern writers often think of Black's role in more dynamic terms than merely trying to equalize. Rowson writes that "the idea of Black trying to 'equalize' is questionable. I think it has limited application to a few openings, rather than being an opening prescription for Black in general". Evans wrote that after one of his games against Fischer, "Fischer confided his 'secret' to me: unlike other masters, he sought to win with the black pieces from the start. The revelation that Black has dynamic chances and need not be satisfied with mere equality was the turning point in his career, he said". Watson surmised that Kasparov, when playing black, bypasses the question of whether White has an opening advantage "by thinking in terms of the concrete nature of the dynamic imbalance on the board, and seeking to seize the initiative whenever possible". Watson observes that "energetic opening play by Black may ... lead to a position so complex and unclear that to speak of equality is meaningless. Sometimes we say 'dynamically balanced' instead of 'equal' to express the view that either player is as likely as the other to emerge from complications with an advantage. This style of opening play has become prevalent in modern chess, with World Champions Fischer and Kasparov as its most visible practitioners".
Modern writers also question the idea that White has an enduring advantage. Suba, in his influential 1991 book "Dynamic Chess Strategy", rejects the notion that the initiative can always be transformed into an enduring advantage. He contends that sometimes the player with the initiative loses it with no logical explanation, and that, "Sometimes you must lose it, just like that. If you try to cling to it, by forcing the issue, your dynamic potential will become exhausted and you won't be able to face a vigorous counter-attack". Rowson and Watson concur. Watson also observes, "Because of the presumption of White being better, the juncture of the game at which Black frees his game or neutralizes White's plans has often been automatically assumed to give him equality, even though in dynamic openings, the exhaustion of White's initiative very often means that Black has seized it with advantage".
In chess tournaments and matches, the frequency with which each player receives white and black is an important consideration. In matches, the players' colours in the first game are determined by drawing lots, and alternated thereafter. In All-play-all round robin tournaments with an even number of players, each receives one extra white or black. The double-round robin tournament is considered to give the most reliable final standings, since each player receives the same number of whites and blacks, and plays both white and black against each opponent.
In Swiss system tournaments, the tournament director tries to ensure that each player receives, as nearly as possible, the same number of games as white and black, and that the player's colour alternates from round to round.

Kernot Range

The Kernot Range is a small mountain range in the south of the Northern Territory, Australia. It is located in the Angas Downs Indigenous Protected Area, near the junction of the Lasseter Highway and Luritja Road. The range consists of a singe ridge of deformed sedimentary rock, running in a northwest-southeasterly direction for about 18 km.
The Kernot Range was named by the explorer W. H. Tietkens when he reached the area on 18 July 1889. He named it after William Charles Kernot, a professor at the University of Melbourne. He named Mount Thompson, the highest peak in the north-western end of the range, after a politician from Victoria, H. M. Thompson.
The hills are culturally important to southern Luritja people, many of whom live in the surrounding area. The most important ceremonial site in the Kernot Range is Wilbia (also spelled Wilpia or Wilpiya). This is a clearing at the south-eastern end of the range that contains a soakage. The soak is a reliable source of water and an important place to many families living across the Luritja homeland. The site is connected with similar Dreaming sites at Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa. Wilbia is often used for rituals and ceremonies, including initiations.

The Lasseter Highway is a highway in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is a sealed road that runs for . It connects Yulara, Kata Tjuṯa and Uluṟu to the Stuart Highway. It is the major access route for tourists heading to Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park. The highway is named after the prospector Harold Bell Lasseter, who claimed to have discovered a rich gold deposit (Lasseter's Reef) west of Kata Tjuṯa.
The highway begins in Erldunda, a roadhouse and hotel, on the Stuart Highway (N87). The Stuart Highway connects Darwin in the north and Adelaide in the south and is therefore one of Australia's major highways. From Erldunda, the Lasseter Highway leads west along the southern side of the Basedow and Kernot Ranges. After about 110 km, next to the Kernot Range, there is the junction with the Luritja Highway (S3), which leads north to Kings Canyon. Another 25 km towards the southwest is a rest area that has a view of Mount Conner. A further 22 km away is the Curtin Springs, a cattle station with a roadhouse. A further 100 km west along the highway is the tourist town Yulara. After Yulara, the road meets the Great Central Road, a dirt road that leads into Western Australia through the Petermann Ranges and across the Gibson and Great Victoria Deserts.
There are petrol stations at Erldunda (at the start of the highway), Mount Ebenezer (km 57) and Curtin Springs (km 245).

Stephen Krashen

Stephen Krashen is a linguist and educational researcher. He is professor emeritus at the University of Southern California (USC). Krashen moved from the USC linguistics department to the School of Education in 1994. He is also an activist who works hard to support bilingual education.
Dr. Krashen has published more than 350 papers and books about second-language acquisition, bilingual education, and reading. He introduced several important ideas in the study of learning another language, including the acquisition-learning hypothesis, input hypothesis, monitor hypothesis, affective filter, and the natural order hypothesis. He started the Natural Approach to language learning and teaching with Tracy D. Terrell . More recently, Krashen promotes the use of "free voluntary reading" during second-language acquisition, which he says "is the most powerful tool we have in language education, first and second."
Krashen lives and works in California. Government plans for education there turned against bilingual education. Krashen said that this was a bad idea and responded with research that showed problems with he new policies. He also spoke publicly and wrote many letters to newspaper editors. In 1998, Krashen campaigned very hard against Proposition 227. Though he tried hard, the proposition passed and got rid of most bilingual education in California. Even though he lost, Krashen continues to work hard in support of bilingual education as other states try to get rid of it. His letters often appear in many newspapers. Krashen believes researchers should be more active to educate the public, especially about bilingual education.
Krashen holds a black belt in Tae Kwon Do, and was the winner of the 1978 Venice Beach Open Incline Press. He spent two years in Ethiopia teaching English and science with the Peace Corps.

<doc id="392399" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=392399" title="Earth's magnetic field">
Earth's magnetic field

The Earth’s magnetic field is the magnetic field that surrounds the Earth. It is sometimes called the "geomagnetic field".
The Earth’s magnetic field is created by the rotation of the Earth and Earth's core. It shields the Earth against harmful particles in space. The field is unstable and has changed often in the history of the Earth. As the Earth spins the two parts of the core move at different speeds and this is thought to generate the magnetic field around the Earth as though it had a large bar magnet inside it. 
The magnetic field creates magnetic poles that are near the geographical poles. A compass uses the geomagnetic field to find directions. Many migratory animals also use the field when they travel long distances each spring and fall. 
The magnetic poles will trade places during a magnetic reversal.
The Earth’s geomagnetic field is created because of two things. The convective motions in the liquid conducting core inside the center of the Earth are important for making the magnetic field. When the convective motions occur with the electrical currents around the Earth, the magnetic field is created. The Earth’s rotation is what keeps the magnetic field up. The interaction between the convective motions and the electrical currents creates a dynamo effect.
The intensity of the magnetic field is greatest near the magnetic poles where it is vertical. The intensity of the field is weakest near the equator where it is horizontal. The magnetic field’s intensity is measured in gauss.
The magnetic field has decreased in strength through recent years. In the past twenty-two years, the field has decreased its strength 1.7%, on average. In some areas of the field, the strength has decreased up to 10%. The fast strength decrease of the field is a sign that the magnetic field might be reversing. The reversal might happen in the next few thousand years. It has been shown that the movement of the magnetic poles is related to the decreasing strength of the magnetic field.
A geomagnetic reversal is when the north magnetic pole and south magnetic pole trade places. This has happened a few times throughout the Earth’s history. The magnetic reversal happens after the strength of the field reaches zero. When the strength begins to increase again, it will increase in the opposite direction, causing a reversal of the magnetic poles. The time it takes the magnetic field to undergo a reversal is unknown, but can last up to ten thousand years.
The Earth’s magnetic reversals are recorded in rocks, especially in basalt. Scientists believed that the last geomagnetic reversal occurred 780,000 years ago.
The magnetosphere is created by the magnetic field. It is the area around the Earth that acts as a shield against the harmful particles in solar wind. The magnetosphere has many different layers and structures, and solar wind shapes each of these layers. The interaction of solar wind and the magnetosphere also causes the Northern and Southern Lights to appear. The magnetosphere is very important in protecting the Earth against solar storms which increase solar wind activity. Solar storms can cause geomagnetic storms which sometimes have serious affects on the Earth.
The areas in between the north and south magnetic poles are the magnetic field lines. These lines leave the Earth from the vertical point of the South and reenters through the vertical point of the North. These two vertical points are called magnetic dip poles. The magnetic dip poles are commonly referred to as the magnetic poles. The magnetic poles intersect the earth at two points. The north magnetic pole intersects the Earth at 78.3 N latitude and 100 W longitude. This places the north magnetic pole in the Arctic Circle. The south magnetic pole intersects the Earth at 78.3 S latitude and 142 E longitude. This places the south magnetic pole in Antarctica. The magnetic poles are also where the magnetic fields are the strongest.
The North Magnetic Pole is the point on the surface of Earth's northern hemisphere where the planet's magnetic field points vertically downwards. There is only one place where this occurs, near to (but distinct from) the Geographic North Pole.
Its southern hemisphere counterpart is the South Magnetic Pole. Since the Earth's magnetic field is not exactly symmetrical, a line drawn from one to the other does not pass through the geometric centre of the Earth.
The North Magnetic Pole moves over time due to magnetic changes in the Earth's core. In 2001, it was near Ellesmere Island in northern Canada at . As of 2015, the pole is thought to have moved east beyond the Canadian Arctic territorial claim to .
The Earth's North and South Magnetic Poles are also known as Magnetic Dip Poles, referring to the vertical "dip" of the magnetic field lines at those points.
Earth does change its magnetic poles every million years (plus or minus 250,000 years). Before a change of magnetic field, the Earth's magnetic field becomes weaker and moves around, like a spinning top would before it falls. The Earth has already had hundreds of changes ("flip flops"). Scientists know this as a result of studies of magnetism on the sea floor, near the mid-Atlantic ridge. The lava slowly moves out of this crevasse (gap in the sea floor) and then it cools with its iron oxide molecules all pointing in the new direction of the Earth's magnetic field. We can look at the history of this magnetic field today to look back at the many flips in the past. 
Reversals occur at intervals from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. The most recent geomagnetic reversal, called the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, occurred about 780,000 years ago. Another global reversal of the Earth's field, called the Laschamp event, occurred during the last ice age (41,000 years ago). However, because of its brief duration it is called an "excursion".
Animals which take long migrations may depend on the magnetic field for a guide. 
Some migratory animals know their locations by the intensity of the field. They know the time because of circadian rhythms the field produces. Migratory animals are born with a magnetic map in their head that allows them to migrate great distances safely. Their ability to sense the magnetic field is because of magnetic particles. Other animals have a chemical compass based on a radical pair mechanism.

Mount Curdie is a mountain in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is 958 metres high. It is the highest peak in the Curdie Range, which is a section of the Petermann Ranges. The mountain is located on the southern bank of the Hull River, about southeast of Kaḻṯukatjara. The Great Central Road passes nearby to the north. At the base of the mountain is the valley through which the Hull River flows. The valley contains a place known to local Aboriginal people as Tjunti, where Lasseter's Cave is located.
Ernest Giles named Mount Curdie on 13 March 1874, during his first journey through the Petermann Ranges. He named it after Dr Daniel Curdie, a subscriber to Giles' fund for his expedition.

Prolog

Prolog is a programming language that uses first order logic.It is the most widespread logic programming language. It is declarative. Alain Cormerauer, a French computer scientist developed Prolog in the early 1970s. Prolog is rather different from other programming languages. It uses facts and rules. Given the facts, the rules can be used to derive new facts. 
Note that Prolog uses a paradigm called Negation as failure, which means that formula_1 is assumed if formula_2 cannot be derived. This is different from true logical negation. While negation is failure has its benefits, it often confuses people starting to learn Prolog, as they expect true logical negation.
Prolog also uses Horn clauses. It is a turing-complete programming language.

Horn clause

A Horn clause is a logic disjunction of literals, where at most one of the literals is positive, and all the others are negative. It is named after Alfred Horn who described them in an article in 1951. 
A Horn clause with exactly one positive literal is a definite clause; a definite clause with no negative literals is sometimes called a “fact”; and a Horn clause without a positive literal is sometimes called a goal clause. These three kinds of Horn clauses are illustrated in the following propositional example:
In the non-propositional case, all variables in a clause are implicitly universally quantified with scope the entire clause. Thus, for example:
stands for:
which is logically equivalent to:
Horn clauses play a basic role in constructive logic and computational logic. They are important in automated theorem proving by first-order resolution, because the resolvent of two Horn clauses is itself a Horn clause, and the resolvent of a goal clause and a definite clause is a goal clause. These properties of Horn clauses can lead to greater efficiencies in proving a theorem (represented as the negation of a goal clause).
Horn clauses are also the basis of logic programming, where it is common to write definite clauses in the form of an implication:
In fact, the resolution of a goal clause with a definite clause to produce a new goal clause is the basis of the SLD resolution inference rule, used to implement logic programming and the programming language Prolog.
In logic programming a definite clause behaves as a goal-reduction procedure. For example, the Horn clause written above behaves as the procedure:
To emphasize this backwards use of the clause, it is often written in the backward form:
In Prolog this is written as:
The Prolog notation is actually ambiguous, and the term “goal clause” is sometimes also used ambiguously. The variables in a goal clause can be read as universally or existentially quantified, and deriving “false” can be interpreted either as deriving a contradiction or as deriving a successful solution of the problem to be solved.
Van Emden and Kowalski (1976) investigated the model theoretic properties of Horn clauses in the context of logic programming, showing that every set of definite clauses D has a unique minimal model M. An atomic formula A is logically implied by D if and only if A is true in M. It follows that a problem P represented by an existentially quantified conjunction of positive literals is logically implied by D if and only if P is true in M. The minimal model semantics of Horn clauses is the basis for the stable model semantics of logic programs.
Propositional Horn clauses are also of interest in computational complexity, where the problem of finding truth value assignments to make a conjunction of propositional Horn clauses true is a P-complete problem (in fact solvable in linear time), sometimes called HORNSAT. (The unrestricted Boolean satisfiability problem is an NP-complete problem however.) Satisfiability of first-order Horn clauses is undecidable.

Venn diagram

A Venn diagram is a diagram that shows the logical relation between sets. They were popularised by John Venn in the 1880s, and are now widely used. They are used to teach elementary set theory, and to illustrate simple set relationships in probability, logic, statistics, linguistics and computer science. A Venn diagram uses closed curves drawn on a plane to represent sets. Very often these curves are circles or ellipses. 
Similar ideas had been proposed before Venn. Christian Weise in 1712 ("Nucleus Logicoe Wiesianoe") and Leonhard Euler ("Letters to a German Princess") 1768, came up with similar ideas. The idea was popularised by Venn in "Symbolic Logic", Chapter V "Diagrammatic Representation", 1881. 
The following example uses two sets, A and B, represented here as coloured circles. The orange circle, set A, represents all living creatures that are two-legged. The blue circle, set B, represents the living creatures that can fly. Each separate type of creature can be imagined as a point somewhere in the diagram. Living creatures that both can fly "and" have two legs—for example, parrots—are then in both sets, so they correspond to points in the area where the blue and orange circles overlap. That area contains all such and only such living creatures.
Humans and penguins are bipedal, and so are then in the orange circle, but since they cannot fly they appear in the left part of the orange circle, where it does not overlap with the blue circle. Mosquitoes have six legs, and fly, so the point for mosquitoes is in the part of the blue circle that does not overlap with the orange one. Creatures that are not two-legged and cannot fly (for example, whales and spiders) would all be represented by points outside both circles.
The combined area of sets A and B is called the "union" of A and B, denoted by .
The union in this case contains all living creatures that are either two-legged or that can fly (or both).
The area in both A and B, where the two sets overlap, is called the "intersection" of A and B, denoted by . For example, the intersection of the two sets is not empty, because there "are" points that represent creatures that are in "both" the orange and blue circles.

Dopamine reuptake inhibitor

A dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI) is a drug. Dopamine is a type of brain chemical called a neurotransmitter. Dopamine has many jobs and responsibilities in the brain. Scientists think dopamine controls movement and the human sense of punishment and reward. Dopamine affects dreams, motivation, and sexual gratification, too.
A lack of dopamine is responsible for many diseases and conditions. Sometimes dopamine does not work correctly in the brain. Sometimes the brain does not have enough dopamine. Doctors prescribe dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRI's or DARI's) to help control symptoms. Psychostimulants and antidepressants are types of DRI's. DRI's help manage symptoms of ADHD, narcolepsy, Parkinson's Disease, obesity, substance abuse withdrawal and some mood disorders. Users can become addicted to DRI's sometimes.
DRI's do not have dopamine inside the pills. They help the body make more dopamine, and they change the way dopamine is re-used in the brain.

Prairie restoration

Prairie restoration is a type of habitat conservation, for prairies and habitats that lived alongside prairies. It is the act of restoring land that was once native prairie to how it once was. In North America this is usually defined as "pre-settlement", meaning before Europeans arrived. Much of this land is good for farming and has been plowed for planting crops or turned into pastures. In Illinois, there was once 22 million acres (9 million hectares), now there are less than 2300 acres (920 hectares) of high-quality original prairie remaining.
Invasive species are a big problem with prairies. Since fires cannot burn freely, many new species are taking over, and preventing sunlight from reaching shorter plants. In the United States, European buckthorn is a common problem. Garlic mustard is another. Often areas that once held a hundred different species of plants now only has three or four species.

Thomas Elder

Sir Thomas Elder (August 5, 1817—March 6, 1897) was a Scottish businessman who moved to South Australia and set up the largest wool selling company in the world.
Elder came to South Australia in 1854. He worked with his brother George, and then became a business partners with Edward Stirling, Robert Barr Smith and John Taylor. They spent money setting up the copper mines at Moonta and Wallaroo which made them all very rich. When Stirling and Taylor retired, Elder and Smith became Elder Smith and Company. This company became the biggest wool selling company in the world.
Elder spent money buying large properties for sheep in outback South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia. Some of these included Paratoo, Umberatana, Mount Lyndhurst, Blanchewater and Beltana. He had ridden camels while on holiday in Palestine, and thought they would be good for use in the Australian deserts. He brought 124 camels and Afghan people to breed camels at Beltana. These were used for the building of the Australian Overland Telegraph. Elder provided money and camels for exploration by Peter Egerton Warburton (1872-73), Ernest Giles (1875), John Ross (1874), Lewis (1875), and the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia (1891). 
He became a member of the South Australian Parliament Legislative Council in 1863-69 and 1871-78. He became interested in horse racing and set up stables at Morphetville. He built a grand Scottish style house at Mount Lofty, which was where he died in 1897.
He was a very rich man, and gave money to many organizations in South Australia. This included £26,000 for the University of Adelaide, £20,000 for mathematics and general science, £31,000 to the Medical School, and £21,000 to the School of Music. In his will he gave £10,000 to the Presbyterian Church, £4000 for the Church of England cathedral, £4000 for the Methodist Prince Alfred College, £25,000 to set up a Working Men's Home, and £16,000 to the hospital.

Mir Sultan Khan

Malik Mir Sultan Khan (1905 – 25 April 1966) was the strongest chess master of his time from Asia. He was a manservant from British India who travelled with his master, Colonel Nawab Sir Umar Hayat Khan, to Britain, where he took the chess world by storm. 
In an international chess career of less than five years (1929–33), he won the British Chess Championship three times in four tries (1929, 1932, 1933), and had tournament and match results that put him among the top ten players in the world. Sir Umar then brought him back to his homeland, where he gave up chess and returned to his humble life. He has been called "perhaps the greatest natural player of modern times". He was generally recognised as a grandmaster, but when FIDE took over control of chess, he was forgotten. At the FIDE 1948 meeting, a number of former players were given retrospective titles, but not Khan. 
Sultan Khan learned the Indian form of chess from his father at the age of nine. This was a form of chess which was similar to modern chess, but still had some features of the old Arabic chess. The main feature was that pawns did not move two squares on their first move. Therefore, the role of opening theory was less important, and gemes developed more slowly.
By the time Sultan Khan was 21 he was the strongest player in the Punjab. At that time, Sir Umar took him into his household with the idea of teaching him the European version of the game and introducing him to European master chess. In 1928, he won the all-India championship, scoring eight wins, one draw, and no losses. 
After some training with British masters, Khan entered the British Chess Championship. To everyone's surprise, he won. Next year, in May 1930, Sultan Khan began an international chess career in which he defeated many of the world's leading players. His best results were second to Savielly Tartakower at Liège 1930; third at the Hastings International Chess Congress 1930–31 behind future World Champion Max Euwe and former World Champion José Raúl Capablanca; fourth at Hastings 1931–32; fourth at Bern 1932; and a tie for third with at London 1932, behind World Champion Alexander Alekhine and Salo Flohr. 
Sultan Khan again won the British Championship in 1932 and 1933. In matches he defeated Tartakower in 1931 (four wins, five draws, and three losses) and narrowly lost to Flohr in 1932 (one win, three draws, and two losses). 
Sultan Khan played three times on first board for England at Chess Olympiads. At the 3rd Chess Olympiad, Hamburg 1930, he scored nine wins, four draws, and four losses (64.7%). At the 4th Chess Olympiad, Prague 1931, he faced a much stronger field. He had an outstanding result, scoring eight wins, seven draws, and two losses (67.6%). This included wins against Flohr and Akiba Rubinstein, and draws with Alekhine, Kashdan, Ernst Grünfeld, Gideon Ståhlberg, and Efim Bogolyubov. At the 5th Chess Olympiad, Folkestone 1933, he had his worst result, an even score, winning four games, drawing six, and losing four. Once again, his opponents included the world's best players, such as Alekhine, Flohr, Kashdan, Tartakower, Grünfeld, Ståhlberg, and Lajos Steiner.

Indigenous Protected Area

An Indigenous Protected Area, or IPA, is an area of land or sea owned by the Indigenous peoples of Australia. In an IPA the owners have made an agreement with the Australian Government to protect biodiversity and cultural resources.
There are over 50 IPAs covering an area of more than 36 million hectares. It is planned to increase this area by another 8 million hectares by 2018. In July 2012, the southern Tanami Indigenous Protected Area was declared, covering 10 million hectares in the Northern Territory.

Military radio station of Pierre-sur-Haute

The Military radio station of Pierre-sur-Haute is a site used for French military communications. It is located in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region. It also hosts a civilian radio relay, which is used by Télédiffusion de France.
In the beginning of 2013, the radio station became famous world-wide after the French intelligence agency Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur (DCRI) reportedly attempted to have the article removed from the French Wikipedia. This request was denied by the Wikimedia Foundation in March 2013. After this denial, the DCRI had forced a contributor to the French Wikipedia to remove it leading to world-wide media coverage. The deleted French Wikipedia article was soon restored, because there were no reasons for deletion according to the Wikipedia standards visible. Meanwhile, the article has been translated into 23 other languages, still counting.
In 1913, a semaphore telegraph was built where the military radio station is now. At the time, it was only a small stone building, with the semaphore on top.
In 1961, NATO asked the French army to extend the site. Since then, it is one of the 82 NATO transmission stations in Europe. This network is known as ACE High system. In this network, the Pierre-sur-Haute station, served as a relay between the Lachens station to the south, and the Mont-Août station to the north. It used four 10 kW transmitters and sixteen receivers. In 1974, the French Air Force took control of the station. In 1988, NATO began to decommission the ACE High system.
The site is owned by the French Air Force. It is controlled from a site near Lyon, about away. It has a heliport, and accessible by helicopter. There is also a private road, which starts at the Col du Béal. This road cannot be used when there is heavy snow of more than . Another option is using a hiking trail, which can be used by tracked vehicles. Since the site is of strategic importance to the French army, it has been "hardened". This means that it has its own power supply and can withstand an attack.
There are about twenty people on site. The main purpose of the site is to analyse and relay signals.

Coobool Creek

Coolbool Creek is an archaeological site site near the Wakool River in New South Wales, Australia. It is about half way between Swan Hill and Deniliquin. The site is near Doherty's Hut at Coobool Crossing, although the exact spot is unknown. G. M. Black found 126 skulls at the site in 1950. It has been difficult to give an exact age for the skulls, but one has been dated to 14,300 years ago. Some of the skulls also show artificial cranial deformation. The age, location, and deformities make the site similar to another Pleistocene site at Kow Swamp. Some scientists have said that this shows they were part of the same population, but others have disagreed. Because Coolbool Creek skulls were found on the surface it is difficult to date them, and other scientists have argued that they might be much older.
The skulls were kept at the University of Melbourne until 1984. They were returned to the local Aboriginal communities and reburied.

Birksgate Range

The Birksgate Range is a scattered group of mountains in the northwest of South Australia. It is on the northeast edges of the Great Victoria Desert. It spreads for about from Iltur in the southeast to Watarru in the northwest. The northern portion of it is protected in the Watarru Indigenous Protected Area. The range consists of granitic rock protrusions that have been weathered into rounded and rugged hills. They are not visibly connected to each other. Each are separated by flat plains and sand dunes. The mountains are fairly low in elevation; they are highest at the northern end.
Prominent peaks in the range include the following: Mounts Lindsay (819 m) and Wooltarlinna are at the northeastern end of the range, near Watarru. Further southwest are Mounts Holder and Sir Thomas (773 m). From here the range spreads southeast along the edge of the desert and the hills generally become lower and more widely dispersed. Mount Poondinna (678 m) is the highest peak in the central part of the range. Mounts Cheesman and Yaroona (also spelled Yaruna) are further to the southeast. The southern end of the range is at Iltur (Coffin Hill).
The Birksgate Range was named by the explorer David Lindsay, who led the Elder Scientific Exploring Expedition across the Great Victoria Desert between April 1891 and March 1892. He named the range for the man who funded and equipped their expedition, Sir Thomas Elder. "Birksgate" was the name of Elder's house in Adelaide.

Tipu Sultan

Tipu Sultan (20 November 1750 – 4 May 1799), also known as the Tiger of Mysore, was the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore from 1782 to 1799. He was also a scholar, soldier and poet. Tipu was the eldest son of Sultan Hyder Ali of Mysore and his wife Fatima Fakhr-un-Nisa. Tipu introduced several new laws, including new coinage, a new lunisolar calendar and a new land revenue system. He started the growth of the silk industry in Mysore. Tipu succeeded to a large kingdom bordered by the Krishna River in the north, the Eastern Ghats in the east and the Arabian Sea in the west. At the request of the French, he built a church, the first in Mysore. Tipu Sultan fought against the British to keep Mysore's independence.
Tipu Sultan, prominently known as Sher-e-Mysore (Tiger of Mysore) is also given the sobriquet of Sher-e-Hind and Sher-e-Mashriq (Tiger of the East). A legendary ruler, he not only opposed British rule in South India but also played a major role in keeping the British forces away from South India. He was one of those rare rulers who had the gumption to challenge the British Government.
No wonder, the mighty Tippoo Sahib (as addressed by British) defeated the foreign invaders in the First and Second Anglo Mysore War and even dictated terms to the British in the subsequent Treaty of Madras and Mangalore respectively. 
Tipu was born in the Bangalore area of Devanhalli to a military officer Hyder Ali in the kingdom of Mysore in the year 1750. Hyder Ali and his wife Fatima Fakhr Un Nisa named their baby as Fath Ali but often called him as Tipu after the local saint Tipu Mastan Aulia. Tipu Sultan’s full name was Sultan Fateh Ali Khan Shahab. Soon, Hyder Ali’s career progressed and in 1761 he became the ruler of Mysore. Since, Hyder Ali had a political alliance with the French, Tipu studied military tactics and strategies from the French.
He had some of the best tutors to teach him various subjects like shooting, riding and swordsmanship. Perhaps that is why Tipu at a very young age of 15 with only two to three thousand force could capture the family of the Malabar chief. No wonder, the Malabar ruler surrendered to only Hyder Ali because of Tipu Sultan’s successful invasion of Malabar.
Ghazi Khan, one of the main officer in the military of Hyder Ali and also a great warrior himself, personally tutored Tipu Sultan. He gave Tipu the necessary military education which not only made Tipu a great soldier but also a great General.
After Hyder Ali died due to Carbuncle in the year 1782, Tipu became the new ruler of Mysore. This new ruler who had already fought two war – First Anglo Mysore and Second Anglo Mysore War under the leadership of his father knew that British forces were a great threat to the independent Kingdom of Mysore. He therefore focused more on military advances especially Mysorean rockets which were successfully used by his father in the Second Anglo Mysore War against the British. 
Mysorean missiles were iron cased rockets fitted with swords in them. These rockets used to travel long, covering various kilometres up in the air before launching down – attacking the enemies with sword. Although there were missiles in the Europe, Mysorean Missiles became famous due to their coverage and destructive capacity. Hyder Ali’s Mysore rockets, undoubtedly, were very advanced missiles than what the British had seen. Tipu Sultan had written a Military Manual Fathul Mujahidin in which he explained the operation of these Mysore Rockets. This was mainly due to the iron tubes which were used for holding the rocket propellant. No wonder, it enabled greater thrust and extended distance up to 2 km.
In the year 1801, several of the Mysore rockets were sent to England in the Royal Arsenal lab for R&D by Col. (Later Sir) William Congreve. Roughly, 4 years later in the year 1805, Royal Arsenal came up with their first Congreve rocket only due to the Technology devised by Haider Ali and his son Tipu Sultan. These Congreve Rockets helped the British troops in the Napolenic Wars and also in the War of 1812. Not to forget, the Battle of Baltimore in the year 1814 was won mainly due to these rockets.
Bangalore Fort although built by Kempe Gowda of Vijaynagar Empire in the 16th century, was renovated and made into a stone fort by Hyder Ali in 1761. At one point of time when British bombed the fort, Tipu Sultan repaired it completely. However, the fort was captured by the British after the third Anglo Mysore War. Currently, Delhi Gate and remnants of bastions are the only two parts remaining of this once so powerful fort.
Within the Bangalore fort, there is a palace made of wood famously known as Tipu Sultan’s Summer Palace which though started during the period of Hyder Ali ended during the reign of Tipu Sultan. An example of Indo-Islamic architecture, the walls of the palace are embellished by pretty flower motifs. Currently, the fort is a tourist place in Bangalore near the Kalasipalyam Bus Stand.
Tipu Sultan in his tenure also finished the construction of Lal Bagh Botanical Garden in the Bangalore area which was started by his father Haider Ali. The garden has a large collection of tropical plants as well as a lake and an aquarium. Located in South Bangalore, it is one of the major hot spot of Bangalore. The garden is made in the Mughal style and comprises several plants and trees from various nations.
Srirangapatnam, the island fortress was the capital of Mysore during the 18th century. It was so well organized with good trade routes that British feared terrible consequences. In addition, the ruler of Mysore had an effective army as that of British army. This led to four wars back to back. Although the first two wars were won by the Ruler of Mysore, the third had dire consequences – Tipu’s two son aged 8 and 10 were detained by the British forces. Finally, in the fourth, Tipu Sultan the ruler of Mysore breath’d his last in 1799 at Srirangapatnam.

Barabbas

Barabbas is a person from the Bible who lived around the time of Jesus (33 AD). He has a bad reputation for being a liar, thief, insurrectionist and zealot. He was released by Pontius Pilate the Roman governor of Judea who presided over Jesus' trial. The most notable thing about Barabbas is that this name was his surname (last name), but his first name was also Jesus. So when Pilate — who was warned by his wife to leave this Holy man alone — offered to set free one of the prisoners, he was offering the crowd in Jerusalem two Jesuses to choose from: Jesus Barabbas or Jesus of Nazareth. Pilate released Barabbas and ordered Jesus, "King of the Jews", to be crucified.

Wolf–Rayet star

Wolf–Rayet stars (WR stars) are evolved, massive stars (over 20 solar masses initially). They are losing mass rapidly by means of a very strong stellar wind, with speeds up to 2000 km/s. While our own Sun loses about 10 solar masses every year, Wolf–Rayet stars typically lose 10 solar masses a year.
Wolf–Rayet stars are extremely hot, with surface temperatures in the range of 30,000 K to around 200,000 K. They are also highly luminous, from tens of thousands to several million times the bolometric luminosity of the Sun, although not exceptionally bright visually since most of their output is in far ultraviolet and even "soft" X-rays.
In astronomy, luminosity is not quite the same thing as brightness. Luminosity measures the total amount of energy emitted</u/l> by a star or other astronomical object in SI units of joules per second, which are watts. A watt is one unit of power, and just as a light bulb is measured in watts, so is the Sun, which has a total power output of 3.846×10 W. This number is the basic metric used in astronomy: it is known as 1 solar luminosity, the symbol for which is formula_1. 
Radiant power, however, is not the only way to conceptualize brightness, so other metrics are also used. The most common is apparent magnitude, which is the perceived brightness of an object from an observer on Earth at visible wavelengths. Other metrics are absolute magnitude, which is an object's intrinsic brightness at visible wavelengths, irrespective of distance. The measure of luminosity is "bolometric magnitude", the total power output across all wavelengths.

Star formation

Star formation means the earliest stages in a star's life. Dense regions of particles exist in molecular clouds known as "stellar nurseries". The clouds collapse under gravitation into spheres of plasma to form stars. 
High density regions of the interstellar medium (ISM) form clouds, or "nebulae", where star formation takes place. 
In the dense nebulae where stars are produced, much of the hydrogen is in the molecular (H) form, so these nebulae are called molecular clouds. The largest such formations, giant molecular clouds, have densities of 100 particles per cm, diameters of , and masses up to 6 million solar masses, and an average interior temperature of 10 K. About half the total mass of the galactic ISM is found in molecular clouds. In the Milky Way there are about 6,000 molecular clouds, each with more than 100,000 solar masses. The nearest nebula to the Sun where massive stars are being formed is the Orion nebula, away. However, lower mass star formation is occurring about 400–450 light years distant in the ρ Ophiuchi cloud complex.
A more compact site of star formation is the opaque clouds of dense gas and dust known as Bok globules; so named after the astronomer Bart Bok. The Bok globules are typically up to a light year across and contain a few solar masses. They can be seen as dark clouds against bright emission nebulae or background stars. Over half the known Bok globules have been found to contain newly forming stars.
A spiral galaxy like the Milky Way contains stars, the remains of stars (stellar remnants) and a diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) of gas and dust. The interstellar medium consists of 10 to 10 particles per cm usually of about 70% hydrogen by mass, with most of the remaining gas consisting of helium. This medium is chemically enriched by trace amounts of heavier elements that were ejected from stars as they passed beyond the end of their main sequence lifetime. 
In contrast to spirals, an elliptical galaxy loses the cold component of its interstellar medium within about a billion years. This hinders the galaxy from forming diffuse nebulae except through mergers with other galaxies.
This is a massive protostar about 300 times brighter than our Sun. Astronomers have caught a key stage in the birth of a very heavy star. They used two radio telescope views of the process 18 years apart. The young star is 4,200 light-years from Earth and is surrounded by a doughnut-shaped cloud of dust.
The first observation was in 1996. By 2015 its stellar wind changed from a compact spherical form to a larger, ionized elliptical shape. This gave information about what happens as a massive star forms. Being able to observe its rapid growth is unique, according to Huib van Langevelde of Leiden University, one of the authors of a study of the object.

Indulkana Range

The Indulkana Range is a range of hills in the northwest of South Australia. It is sometimes called the Mount Chandler Range after its highest peak. It is located to the southwest of Indulkana, on the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara lands. The mountains of the Indulkana area are part of the traditional country of the Yankunytjatjara and Antakarinya.
The range consists of a series of parallel ridges running east to west. The southern side of the range ends in an escarpment, the most prominent point of which is Chambers Bluff. The rock is made up of quartzite and sandstone rock, resting on slates of kaolinised clay. At the eastern end of the range is Mount Chandler, which overlooks the settlement of Indulkana and the Indulkana Creek. It rises about from its base. It is made up of quartzite, quartz sandstone and sandstone. Slightly north of the escarpment, and following its path from east to west, is a series of gorges that split the hills. The gorges contain several reliable springs.

A hydrazone is the functional group with structure RRC=NNH. They are like aldehydes or ketones, with an NNH group instead of the oxygen atom.
They are made by reacting hydrazines with ketones or aldehydes:
Hydrazones are very useful molecules to do some reactions. For example, a ketone can be reduced down completely if made into a hydrazine and then treated with sodium ethoxide (Wolff–Kishner reduction). Hydrazones are very important intermediates in many reactions, such as the Fischer indole synthesis. This makes indoles, groups which are found in many drugs.

<doc id="392683" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=392683" title="Reaction intermediate">
Reaction intermediate

A reaction intermediate or simply intermediate is a molecule that is formed during a chemical reaction. It is not the final product, but it is something that is more like the product than the reactants. After every step in a reaction mechanism, an intermediate is formed.
Intermediates usually stay around for a little time because they are very reactive. However, it is important not to confuse an intermediate with a transition state. The latter is at a point of maximum energy. An intermediate instead is at a point of minimum energy, i.e. it is a stable molecule. Intermediates can be isolated from a reaction if needed. 
For example, in the reaction:
A + B → X → C + D
X is the intermediate. In going from A + B to X and from X to C + D, the reaction will go through a transition state.

Although it appears to be a single star to the naked eye, it is actually a star system of four stars in two binary pairs. The first pair consists of two bright, large type-G giant stars, both with a radius about 10 times the Sun's, in close orbit around each other. These two stars are thought to be cooling and expanding on their way to becoming red giants. 
The second pair, around 10,000 astronomical units from the first, consists of two faint, small and relatively cool red dwarfs. The Capella system is relatively close, at only from Earth.
The system is a member of the Hyades moving group, a group of stars moving in the same direction as the Hyades cluster.

Wolf 359 is a red dwarf in the constellation Leo. About 7.8 light years from the Earth, it has an apparent magnitude of 13.5 and can only be seen with a large telescope. 
Wolf 359 is one of the nearest stars to the Solar System. Only the Alpha Centauri system (including Proxima Centauri), Barnard's Star, and WISE 1049-5319 are closer. It is mentioned in several works of fiction.
Wolf 359 is one of the faintest and lowest-mass stars known. At the light-emitting layer called the photosphere, it has a temperature of about 2,800 K, which is low enough for chemical compounds to form and survive. The absorption lines of compounds such as water and titanium(II) oxide are in the spectrum. 
The surface has a magnetic field which is stronger than the average magnetic field on the Sun. As a result of magnetic activity caused by convection, Wolf 359 is a flare star that has sudden increases in luminosity for several minutes. These flares give off strong bursts of X-ray and gamma ray radiation. Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years. No companions or disks of debris have been detected in orbit around it.

Feral

A feral organism is a plant or animal which has changed from being tame or cultivated to being wild. 
A feral animal is one which has escaped from a domestic or captive status and is living more or less as a wild animal. Animals which were wild before they escaped from captivity are not regarded as feral. For example, a lion which has escaped from a zoo is not a feral animal. Some common examples of animals with feral populations are goats, cats, and pigs. 
Domesticated plants that revert to wild are usually known as escaped, introduced or naturalized rather than feral. However, the changes seen in plants that go wild is similar to those of animals.
Some species go feral easily and successfully. Other species usually do not usually survive in the wild.
The introduction of animals or plants to new areas may break down ecosystems. In some cases it has caused the extinction native species. However, returning lost species to their environment can have the opposite effect, bringing damaged ecosystems back into balance. However, sometimes feral species may control other "problem" species such as rodents, harmful insects, or aggressive plants.
Dogs can change to feral animals easily, becoming successful hunters. 
The cat can easily become feral. Feral cats are pests in both rural and urban areas. They have seriously damaged bird, reptile and mammal populations. As feral cats breed quickly, it is difficult to control their populations. In rural areas, feral cats are often shot. More recently, the "Trap-Neuter-Return" method has been used as an alternate means of managing the feral cat population.
The goat is one of the oldest domesticated animals, yet easily goes feral and does quite well on its own.
The dromedary camel, which has been domesticated for well over 3,000 years, will also readily go feral. Feral camels, descended from pack animals that escaped in the 19th and early 20th centuries, thrive in the Australian interior today.
Sheep are vulnerable to predation and injury, and do not usually survive as feral animals. However, in places where there are few predators, they get on well, for example in the case of the Soay sheep.
Water buffalo are found in the wetter parts of Western and Northern Australia. The Australian government encourages the hunting of feral water buffalo because of their large numbers.
Cattle have been domesticated since the neolithic era, but can survive for months or even years with little or no supervision. Their ancestors, the Aurochs, were quite fierce. Modern cattle, especially those raised on open range, are generally more docile, but when threatened can display aggression. Cattle, particularly those raised for beef, are often allowed to roam quite freely and have established long term independence in Australia, New Zealand and several Pacific Islands. There are small populations of semi-feral animals living the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Such cattle are called Mavericks, Scrubbers or Cleanskins. Most free roaming cattle, however untamed, are valuable and are usually rounded up in closely settled regions.
Horses and donkeys, domesticated about 5000 BCE, are feral in open grasslands worldwide ("see" feral horse). In Portugal, feral horses are called Sorraia; in Australia, they are called Brumbies; in the American west, they are called Mustangs. Other isolated feral populations exist, including the Chincoteague Pony and the Banker Horse. They are often referred to as "wild horses," but this is not correct. There are truly "wild" horses that have never been tamed, most notably Przewalski's Horse. While the horse was originally indigenous to North America, the wild ancestor died out at the end of the last Ice Age. In both Australia and the Americas, modern "wild" horses have come from domesticated horses brought by European explorers and settlers that escaped, spread, and thrived.
The pig has feral populations all over the world, including Australia, New Zealand, the United States, New Guinea and the Pacific Islands. Pigs were introduced to the Melanesian and Polynesian regions by humans from several thousand to five hundred years ago, and to Australia and the Americas within the past 500 years. While pigs were brought to New Zealand by the original Polynesian settlers, this population had become extinct by the time of European settlement. All feral pigs in New Zealand today have come from European farm animals. Many European wild boar populations are also come from from escaped domestic pigs and are technically feral animals, although they live in the native range of the ancestral species.
Rock Pigeons were once kept for their meat or more commonly as racing animals and have established feral populations in cities worldwide.
Colonies of honey bees often escape into the wild. Their behavior, however, is no different from their behavior "in captivity", until and unless they breed with other feral honey bees of a different genetic stock, which may lead them to become more docile or more aggressive (see Africanized bees).
Large populatiions of feral parrots are present in various parts of the world. The Rose-ringed Parakeets, Monk Parakeets and Red-masked Parakeets (subject of the documentary movie, The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill) being particularly successful outside of their native habitats and adapting well to suburban environments.
A feral population can damage an ecosystem by eating vulnerable plants or animals, or by competition with indigenous species. Feral plants and animals are often invasive species, and can be a threat to endangered species.
Domestic animals can breed with native, wild animals. This interbreeding can threaten the existence of the original wild population. Examples include the mallard duck, wild boar, the rock dove or pigeon, the Red Junglefowl ("Gallus gallus") (ancestor of all chickens), carp, and salmon. Another example is the dingo, itself an early feral dog, which interbreeds with dogs of other origin. However it is unlikely that this will harm the ecosystems in which these dogs live and some regard the importance of this phenomenon as disputable. In some cases like rabbits, the interbreeding seems not to be noticed. There is much debate over the effect of interbreeding on changes to the genes of a wild species. 
Feral animals compete for food with domestic livestock. They may damage fences, water sources, and vegetation (by overgrazing or introducing seeds of invasive plants). Though hotly disputed, some cite as an example the competition between feral horses and cattle in the western United States. Another example is of goats competing with cattle in Australia, or goats that damage trees and vegetation in environmentally-stressed regions of Africa. Accidental crossbreeding by feral animals may result in harm to breeding programs of pedigreed animals. Their presence may also excite domestic animals and push them to escape. Feral populations can also pass on diseases to domestic herds.
Many feral animals can sometimes be captured at little cost and are therefore an important economic resource. Throughout most of Polynesia and Melanesia feral pigs are the main sources of animal protein. Prior to the Free-roaming Wild Horse and Burro Protection Act of 1971, American mustangs were often captured and sold for horsemeat. In Australia feral goat, pig and camel meat is exported. At certain times, animals were sometimes deliberately left to go feral, typically on islands, in order to be later recovered for profit or food use for travelers (particularly sailors) at the end of a few years.
Scientists can study populations of feral animals to learn about population dynamics, ecology and behavior (ethology) in a wild state of species known mainly in a domestic state. This can give useful information for farmers.
Feral populations sometimes have or develop characteristics which do not always exist in the fully domesticated equivalent. This helps domestic biodiversity and often deserves to be preserved, be it in their feral environment or as domestic animals. For example, feral species that are usually subjects of eradication in certain habitats could become the subject of study to determine if there is a need for their preservation.
American Mustangs have been protected since 1971 in part due to their romance and connection to the history of the American West.

Panama Canal Zone

The Panama Canal Zone () is a former unorganized United States territory. It is now the country of Panama.
In 1903, the territory was controlled by the United States. As a part of the United States, the canal was used for military purposes. The Panama Canal was operated by the United States until December 31, 1999, when it returned to Panama.
It was disestablished in October 1, 1979 as part of a treaty signed in 1977 by former President Jimmy Carter and Omar Torrijos, the unofficial leader of Panama Canal Zone.
The treaty was approved by the provisional Panamanian government on December 2, 1903, and by the US Senate on February 23, 1903. While the treaty was approved, the Panamanians received US$10 million, much of which the United States required to be invested in that country. The Canal Zone was formally turned over by Panama on May 4, 1904, when American officials reopened the Panama City offices of the canal company and raised the American flag.
