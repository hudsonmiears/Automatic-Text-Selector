I would like to talk with Majorly about some of my recent edits but his talk page is being protected so i can't communicate with him properly.
I was a former vandal. Not a major one on en.wikipedia.org just someone messing around on a public terminal from an IP address back in 2006. However, I've learnt since then and grown up. I'm not a vandal anymore. I would like to be helpful here, but don't in all honesty know how to
I have tried to add some comments to . They are about a 'bot' that the user has written. But the page has 'view source' instead of 'change this page'. What do I need to do? () 09:11, 22 September 2009 (UTC)
This is about 'Darkicebot'. should put a statement on describing what the 'bot' is designed to do, and the rules that are used to do this. We could then see if there is a problem with the intention. We may be able to offer advice. () 09:29, 22 September 2009 (UTC)
Hi all! I know this has been proposed and turned down in the past, but I'd like to suggest the starting of Very Good Pictures (equivalent to FPs at enwp). Last time around, the main concern was that the pics were not "ours", they "belonged to commons". Well, even at enwp, all FPs are free use and a majority of them are from Commons. I think this will generate interest among our editors and readers. If we start something like "Picture of the day", then it'll be a nice change to our Main Page. Yes, I accept that we must concentrate on article building, but then, very small projects have this feature, so I think we can start this. Regards, 10:51, 21 September 2009 (UTC)

I'm thinking of writing a bot to create redirects. Information is at . Please leave comments there. 22:03, 24 September 2009 (UTC)
Remember ?? Well, apparently, he seems to have remorse for his actions. Before you ask, no, I'm not him, nor was I recruited here by him. (also, he was about 15-16 when he started his vandalism with friends at high school, he's now 19, and in a year from now, well, he's 20!)
He's admitted to me privately he's been an idiot, and f***ed up the sites, but now finds vandalism boring. He said when he found a vandalised article on something he liked
(Liverpool F.C.) it stopped him from doing it, and gave him a reality check.
I'm not asking for an unban, just explaining. He is "emotionally different". As for his choice of username, well, it "was" plagiarism (and the owner of the website with that name has forgiven him for it), but he's decided to move on now. I'm here to edit some other stuff and so am not singlepurpose account.
Anyway, that's my speech over and done with. Apologies for his behaviour, yes, he is emotionally different, but he's now found other outlets for if he gets pent-up anger/energy and has realized a wiki is not for that. He now wants to be a "proper editor", if there's such a thing. Kurt aka -- () 19:21, 26 September 2009 (UTC)

Hello,
does anybody know if Miszabot allows to "pin" certain discussions, so they don't get archived; I just cleared "Any point" (3 times in the archive, not cleared here); I am unsure whether this is a bug, or intentional, though.
Just a quick note, help appreciated.-- () 22:09, 24 September 2009 (UTC)
I would like to become a part of the Wiki community, but it seems most of you speak 
a different language...I've worked through the tutorials and still feel lost. Any suggestions? Should I just leave it alone altogether? I've been successful
in minor edits and things, but still feel like I'm out of the loop. I also had an article entitled "ServejesusForReal.com deleted twice, and it was an unfinished article...help! 
I've noticed a lot of incivility over the past few days and I'd like to remind all users to . I'll definitely be sending out gentle reminders from now on to users who are being downright rude to other users. No matter how annoying a user may be, please be kind (civil) and discuss the matter in a calm way. I am particularly displeased with admins who have said some very unprofessional and mean things. Its not great if this wiki to overly kind to vandals, but it's much worse if we're overly mean to each other! Vandals can be dealt with without resorting to name calling or insults. Please review if you need to. In good faith, 00:34, 3 October 2009 (UTC)
I agree with you, EhJJ. I have seen users engaging in incivility a lot, though, I won't be naming or pointing to any particular incidents as you clarify that you won't do, and because this thread is "not directed at any one in particular". — 02:54, 3 October 2009 (UTC)
Per this proposal, please have some bots move the tags on talk pages. Thanks, () 20:46, 27 September 2009 (UTC)
<-- Instead of commenting on an archived discussion I'll comment here. As anyone who looks at my contributions here and elsewhere can see I rarely use tags. However I do look at them regularly and think they can be very helpful when someone reads the article. Having problems with tags because they are repetitive or problematic in other ways is fine and needs to be looked at and fixed if possible (sometimes repetitive is unavoidable). That being said however, I seriously disagree with moving most tags on the talk page. Are there some tags that maybe could be moved there?.. maybe but I can't think of any at the moment. I read talk pages when I read articles, especially on EnWiki, because you often see more information about the subject there amid the discussions. I have a feeling however that most people do NOT. If you have the tags on the main page you are a lot more likely to have someone read the article, see the tag and work to fix the article. That of course is the whole point of the tags in the first place and I don't think expecting everyone to read the talk page for every article they read is a good assumption for us to make and would therefore almost guarantee some amount of fixes not being made that would have been in the past. I assume that the biggest problem with them on the main page is for aesthetics (how the page looks)? If that is the case then I would say aesthetics is less important then function and they should therefore stay on the page. TLDR: Important to keep on main page, looks less important then function () 23:41, 28 September 2009 (UTC)
I was under the impression we respected one another here, and that foul language was not used, and was surprised to find the language in this article was otherwise... () 15:10, 5 October 2009 (UTC)
Hello again, I may have already brought this up, the (V)GA process was one of the things that seemed to work on this wikipedia, that is until it was changed recently. Beforehand, we had a multi-stage process, with first commenting and improving the candidate, and then "voting" if it should be promoted or not. This was then changed, as we all know voting is evil, and cannot replace a discussion. Now, the process is supposedly based on consensus. I don't know about other editors, but at least I am now totally unsure about several things:
While many people seem to advocate the system of discussing rather than voting, what are the steps we can undertake to make the process more manageable?- The theaory was that any editor should be able to promote articles/close the discussions, yet judging consensus, picking the right time are skills the community ecxpects bureaucrats to have.
If we cannot get the new system to be as manageable as the old, I suggest we undo the changes and return to a system that had its (well-known) weak points, but otherwise seemed to have worked reasonably well...-- () 09:47, 3 October 2009 (UTC)
Being honest, the new system does not work. Let's go back to the old one which was good! 10:37, 3 October 2009 (UTC)
I have nothing against anything. You came here to simply state "I like the old system. It's better" which is the equivalent of saying "I like strawberry ice-cream". You then said the current system created drama and had fewer participants. I'm saying the only drama is created here by these types of discussion and the level and quality of participation in the current process is way better than before. And no, talk pages are not for "accusations", not in my world, they're used to promote useful discussion about Wikipedia and its articles. () 11:04, 3 October 2009 (UTC)
Hi all, Although we will soon remove the centralnotice that is up, the
Wikimedia Strategic Planning project is still looking for volunteers
to serve as
subject area advisors or to sit on that will
study particular and make recommend short- and long-term
strategies for the Wikimedia projects and Foundation, and the wiki movement.
To apply to serve on a task force or be an advisor in a specific area,
visit http://volunteer.wikimedia.org.
The Wikimedia Strategic Planning project is a year-long collaborative process
being hosted at http://strategy.wikimedia.org. Your input is welcome there, and
will drive the process. When the task forces begin to meet, they will
do their work transparently and on that wiki, and anyone may join
fully in their work. We hope to
include as many community members as possible in the process.
Any questions can be addressed to me either on
at wikimedia.org. I hope you'll consider joining us! () 04:16, 4 October 2009 (UTC)
What ever happened with making assessment scales?(Stub, Start, C, B, A, GA, VGA) I found a few things that said no because there were only 20k articles and half of those would be stubs. What is the status now that there are more then 50k? I am too lazy to dig any more. 00:04, 6 October 2009 (UTC)

I have noticed that indef blocked sockpuppet accounts are being placed in this category, and as such are to be deleted after one month. I think this is a bad idea. The reason being, it makes sockpuppet investigations harder to do. When someone has to search and search and search for an account to compare a possible sockpuppet against when they could have easily found it by looking in the respective sockmasters category, it wastes the reporters time. Also I noticed that the wording at contradicts itself. It states: ""This category is contains userpages of indefinitely blocked users." But then goes onto say: "The following pages should not be in this category, and therefore shouldn't be deleted: Talkpages of indefinitely blocked users."" I am recommending that we clarify that, and remove all sockpuppet accounts from this category. 03:25, 16 October 2009 (UTC)
Following this discussion on notability of Xavier, Kansas I believe the consensus was that "all towns are notable". I view of that decision, I will remove the QD tags put on a number of US towns by . I don't believe we reached a consensus on one sentence stubs, but some one else may remember. (If we have decided to delete one sentence stubs then apologies to Razorflame and I'll delete the pages myself). -- () 06:57, 15 October 2009 (UTC)
Towns are "not" notable just for existing. That's not how Wikipedia works. We are not a directory of every place that ever existed. Articles should have some substance that's more than informing us of its existence, location and population. We should not say all of something is something, we should look at things on their own merits. 10:21, 15 October 2009 (UTC)
Perhaps, since most people think the quick deletion regulations as applied here is purely bureaucratic, why not renominate the oneline city stubs for deletion. No rules as far as I can tell about renominating things for deletion. And, from my point of view, while some people may be aware that the Wales national football team is notable, the page currently provides no to back up this . So some readers would be completely in the dark as to what makes this particular group notable. And saying "national" in the title bestows instant notability, that's simply untrue. Cheers. () 13:21, 15 October 2009 (UTC)
Ahah, I get it now. Okay, well I think there's a general agreement that the Wales (and England and Germany) national football team articles are not "one-line stubs" and need references. We're also probably in agreement that all articles should ideally be referenced, no matter how long they are. As for flooding RC, well that's why we have the flood flag. Finally, the single-sentence stubs about X city in Y county which just say "X is a city in Y", well we're all probably in agreement that they add absolutely NOTHING to this Wikipedia other than make the "Show any page" a tiresome experience. () 13:59, 15 October 2009 (UTC)
(<-) Hello there, I was the one who originally brought up the "cities in Kentucky", a few articles which read "X is a city in Kentucky". My opinion on the notability of places: A place is notable (and not up for quick deletion) if at least one applies:
Most of the cities in Kentucky (a few hundred, I think) were created by one editor; I think spending the same time on getting perhaps two or three of these cities to a decent level of coverage would have been better than a "collect them all" approach. After all, about half of the people in Kentucky live in like 10-12 cities. If someone is really interested in US geography, there are fifty states; for each state, get the state capital and the biggest/most important city of the state...-- () 16:00, 15 October 2009 (UTC)
Here is what I was thinking when I was tagging them for quick deletion: A) They fell under the A4 clause of quick deletion which states that if they don't have a claim of notability, then they can be speedily deleted and B) They were one line stubs which were not going to get expanded. They were valid quick deletion tags and if administrators are starting to not follow even the simplest of deletion policies, then I do not know what the future of this project is. People need to start looking at the facts before they start removing quick deletion tags that were valid in the first place. Stop creating unnecessary drama when you could have easily deleted them and moved on. 00:17, 16 October 2009 (UTC)

Kluge Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Humanities and Social Sciences, given in fields where there are no Nobel Prizes. In announcing the prize, James H. Billington, the librarian of Congress, noted not only Mr. Kolakowski’s scholarship but also his “demonstrable importance to major political events in his own time,” adding that “his voice was fundamental for the fate of Poland, and influential in Europe as a whole.” His work inspired the Solidarity movement in Poland.

Meander

A meander is a curve in a river. Meanders form a snake-like pattern as the river flows across a fairly flat valley floor. The position of the curves changes over time.
The river erodes sediment on the outside of the curves and drops it on the inside of curves. This is because the water moves fastest on the outside of a turn. Slip off slopes are formed on the inside of the bend from deposition and river cliffs are formed on the outside of the bend from erosion. Eventually meanders turn into ox-bow lakes when two outside bends erode together making a shorter route for the water.
Meanders were named for a river in Anatolia.

Manchukuo yuan

The Manchukuo yuan was the money used in the Empire of Manchukuo, from June 1932 until August 1945. 
The Manchukuo yuan would buy 24 grams of silver. The yuan was instead of the Chinese "tael". The tael was common and was in use in Manchuria. A tael would buy about 40 grams of silver.
The Manchukuo yuan would buy 24 grams of silver in 1932. The price of silver changed and the yuan would not buy 24 grams of silver. To show that the yuan had value it was made equal to Japanese money. The Japanese money was called the yen. In 1940 the Manchukuo yuan was being used to measure Manchukuo exports and imports to America, Germany and Japan.
The paper money was in five values in 1932. Each piece of paper money is called a note. There was a one hundred yuan note, a ten yuan note, a five yuan note, a one yuan note and a small value note. A new 1000 yuan note was made in 1944.
The paper money or notes had pictures of Chinese emperors printed on them. The money was first made in Japan. Later they were made by the Bank in the Manchukuo capital of Hsinking (Hsinking is now called Changchun). 
The Yuan was subdivided into 10 "chiao", 100 "fen" or 1000 "li". Coins were made that were worth 5 "li" and bigger values. The largest value coin was 10 "fen".
In 1944 and 1945, Manchukuo made coins of red or brown cardboard. These are a rare coins as they are not made of metal.
On January 1946 Manchukuo Yuan was replaced. The Chinese allowed people to swap 1 Manchukuo for a new type of money called a "North-Eastern Yuan". In 1948 these new yuan could be swapped by a "Gold Yuan". One Gold Yuan cost 150,000 "North Eastern Yuans".

Tropical Storm Jerry (1995)

Tropical Storm Jerry was a weak tropical storm of the very active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. Even though Jerry was weak, Jerry caused 8 deaths and $40 million in damage. Jerry made landfall in Jupiter, Florida and Dixie County, Florida. Jerry was active with four other cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean: Humberto, Iris, Luis, and Karen. Because there was not much damage, the name "Jerry" was not retired and was used again in 2001 and 2007, the name will also be used again in 2013.
A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 9. Over the next week, clouds and other thunderstorms grew near the tropical wave. By August 22 it was upgraded to "Tropical Depression Eleven". Tropical Depression Eleven was located just to the north of Cuba at the time. On August 23 it became "Tropical Storm Jerry". Jerry had winds at 40 miles per hour, however the minimum pressure was not at the lowest still Jerry weakened back to a depression. The National Hurricane Center did not expect to Tropical Depression Eleven to become a tropical storm because most of the showers and thunderstorms were over land.
On August 23, Tropical Storm Jerry made landfall in Jupiter, Florida while it was still a weak tropical storm with winds at 40 miles per hour. It stayed as a tropical storm until it went into the Gulf of Mexico. It made a second landfall in Florida of August 25 while a tropical depression. It crossed into Georgia soon after and into South Carolina. Jerry died on the border of Georgia and South Carolina on August 28. The remains of Jerry either moved to the south back over to Florida or to the east over North and South Carolina. But the remains of Tropical Storm Jerry did last for five days over the United States.
Tropical Storm Jerry killed two people in Florida, three people in South Carolina, and three more in North Carolina. Jerry caused $19 million in damage in Florida, $10 million in South Carolina, and $11 million in North Carolina. In total, Jerry caused $40 million in damage and 8 people to be killed. This was the first time since 1990 that a name starting with the letter "J" was used. It was also only the second time that the name "Jerry" made been used to name a storm in the Atlantic. Because there was not much damage, the name "Jerry" was not retired, so it was used again in 2001 and 2007, it will also be used again in 2013.

Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon

Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (7 September 1707 – 16 April 1788), usually called Buffon, was a French naturalist. He was also a mathematician, cosmologist and encyclopedic author. 
His collected information influenced the next two generations of naturalists, including Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck and Georges Cuvier. 
Buffon published 35 volumes of his "Histoire naturelle" during his lifetime, and nine more were published after his death, for a total of 44 volumes. "Truly, Buffon was the father of all thought in natural history in the second half of the 18th century". 
Buffon held the position of Intendant (Director) of the "Jardin du Roi", now called the "Jardin des Plantes"; it is the French equivalent of Kew Gardens. The "Lycée Buffon" in Paris is named after him.
Buffon is best remembered for his "Histoire naturelle". "Written in a brilliant style, this work was read ... by every educated person in Europe". It was translated into many different languages, making him one of the most widely read authors of the day, a rival to Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Voltaire.
In the opening volumes of the "Histoire naturelle" Buffon questioned the usefulness of mathematics, criticized Carl Linnaeus's taxonomical approach to natural history, outlined a history of the Earth with little relation to the Biblical account, and proposed a theory of reproduction which ran counter to existing ideas. 
The early volumes were condemned by the Faculty of Theology at the Sorbonne. Buffon published a retraction, but he continued publishing the offending volumes without any change.
Buffon noted that despite similar environments, different regions of the world have distinct plants and animals. This observation, later known as Buffon's Law, may be the first principle of biogeography. 
Buffon understood the idea of common descent, and discussed it a number of times. This does not mean he believed in it. Probably he did not, but he discussed it fairly openly on a number of occasions. Interpreting his ideas is not simple, for he returned to topics many times in the course of his work.
In volume 14 he argued that all the world's quadrupeds had developed from an original set of just thirty-eight quadrupeds. On this basis, he is sometimes considered a "transformist" and a precursor of Darwin.
In "Les époques de la nature" (1778) Buffon discussed the origins of the solar system, speculating that the planets had been created by a comet's collision with the sun. 
He also suggested that the earth originated much earlier than the 4004 BC of Archbishop James Ussher. Basing his figures on the cooling rate of iron tested at his Laboratory le Petit Fontenet at Montbard, he calculated that the age of the earth was 75,000 years. Once again, his ideas were condemned by the Sorbonne, and again he issued a retraction to avoid further problems.
Charles Darwin wrote in his preliminary historical sketch added to the third edition of "On the Origin of Species": "Passing over... Buffon, with whose writings I am not familiar." Then, from the fourth edition onwards, he amended this to say that "the first author who in modern times has treated it [evolution] in a scientific spirit was Buffon. But as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he does not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species, I need not here enter on details." 
The paradox of Buffon is that, according to Ernst Mayr:
He was not an evolutionist, yet he was the father of evolutionism. He was the first person to discuss a large number of evolutionary problems, problems that before Buffon had not been raised by anybody... he brought them to the attention of the scientific world.
Except for Aristotle and Darwin, no other student of organisms [whole animals and plants] has had as far-reaching an influence.
He brought the idea of evolution into the realm of science.
He developed a concept of the "unity of type," a precursor of comparative anatomy.
More than anyone else, he was responsible for the acceptance of a long-time scale for the history of the earth.
He was the founder of biogeography.
And yet, he hindered evolution by his frequent endorsement of the immutability of species. He provided a criterion of species, fertility among members of a species, that was thought impregnable.

Nitride

In chemistry, a nitride is a compound of nitrogen with a less electronegative element, attached together in a specific way. Nitrides are a large class of compounds with a wide range of properties and applications.
Most of the names for nitrides follow a simple pattern: the name of the element attached to the nitrogen, then "nitride". So, GaN would be gallium nitride.
There are some exceptions, however, for the compounds that has had a usual name before. For example, NH is not called "hydrogen nitride", even if it is the most simple of this class of molecules, but it is still commonly called ammonia.

Rail gauge

Rail gauge is the distance from the inside of one rail on a railroad track to the inside of the other.
Most countries use a standard gauge of 1,435 mm (4 ft, 8 1/2 in). Wider gauges are called broad gauge, smaller gauges are called narrow gauge. 
Broad gauge may be used where the track needs to have heavy things moving on it. Narrow gauge is used to build railroads for less money, because the smaller track costs less. Places where different gauges meet are called break of gauge.

Hurricane Anita

Hurricane Anita was the only major hurricane of the inactive 1977 Atlantic hurricane season. It struck Mexico as a category 5. Though it struck as a category 5 no one knows the damage. Anita killed 11 people in Mexico.
A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 16. After it moved westward for about a week, it started growing some clouds. It changed the way it was moving to the northwest on August 27 while it was over Cuba, but all clouds were over the Bahamas and Florida. The tropical wave soon crossed Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico. While it entered the Gulf of Mexico, an anticyclone made conditions good for a tropical cyclone to form. The tropical wave also moved slow when it entered the Gulf of Mexico, making it easier for it to develop. By August 29, the tropical wave was good enough to be upgraded to Tropical Depression One.
Tropical Depression One went back on a westward path than a ridge forced it. Conditions remained good and the tropical depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Anita later on August 29. Water temperatures were warm, this allow Tropical Storm Anita to become Hurricane Anita during August 30. Hurricane Anita looked like it would strike Texas at first, but other weather systems did not allow it to do so. Anita began to quickly strengthen, it had become a category 3 hurricane on September 1. By the next day, Hurricane Anita had reached its highest winds as a category 5 hurricane, while not far from the coast of Mexico.
Hurricane Anita stayed as a category 5 hurricane as it made landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas on September 2. Anita weakened fast over land, weakening to a tropical storm over central Mexico later that day. It also weakened to a tropical depression before it reached the Pacific coast of Mexico.
The name Anita was retired. It was not replaced with anything specific because the tropical cyclone names change in 1979.

Nissan Skyline

The Nissan Skyline (スカイライン in Japanese) is a line of compact cars and compact executive cars first made by the Prince Motor Company starting in 1955, and then by Nissan Motor Company after the two companies merged in 1966. After the merger, the Skyline and its larger counterpart, the Nissan Gloria, were sold in Japan at dealership sales channels called Nissan Prince Shop.
It is currently available in either coupé, or sedan body styles. They are most commonly known by their round brake lights. The station wagon bodystyle was ended in 1989 with the introduction of the R32 platform.
Models R30 to R34 of the Skyline are still popular cars for modifying by Japanese car enthusiasts from the 1980s to today. There are available features such as straight-6 engines, turbochargers, and the high-performance GT-R trim. While not distributed in the United States, the Skyline's prominence in video games, movies and magazines resulted in many such cars being imported there from 1999 to late 2005. Motorex petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to allow 1990–1999 GT-Rs and GTSs to be imported, at the condition that they were changed to meet United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.
The 11th-generation Skyline (V35) was another major turning point for the nameplate. It dropped some of the Skyline's trademark characteristics such as the straight-6 engine and turbocharging, eventually separated the GT-R into its own line, and moved to V6-engined era, this decision which extended to all later Skylines. Nissan decided to keep the Skyline for the luxury-sport market. Its platform-mate, the 350Z, revived the Z line of pure sports cars. The V35 was the first Skyline made for export to North America, being sold under Nissan's luxury marque Infiniti as the G35. The Skyline (V36/J50) is sold in Europe, North America, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Middle East as the Infiniti G37.
April 11, 2010 saw a world record for the biggest ever Nissan Skyline meet and the most ever officially recognized on a track in the Guinness Book of World Records. This took place at Silverstone, United Kingdom at the ISTS event.

Vasa (ship)

Vasa was a big Swedish warship. The ship was built from 1626 to 1628. The same year "Vasa" was ready outside Stockholm, but sank by accident on her maiden voyage (first trip). "Vasa" sank because she was too heavy on top. Those who built her knew that she had problems, but they didn't dare say that to the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus. He was not in Sweden when "Vasa" was built and he wanted her to go fight in the Thirty Years' War as soon as possible. There was a hearing about why "Vasa" sank, but no one was found guilty or judged for her sinking.
Swedish divers in diving bells brought up some of "Vasa"'s cannons from the sunken ship in the 1660s. Anders Franzén found "Vasa" in 1956 after he had read about the ship in sources and looked for her in the water around Stockholm. The ship was brought up in 1961 and was then treated with special chemicals so that it would last for a long time. The preservation treatment took almost 20 years to complete. "Vasa" is now in the Vasa Museum in Stockholm, Sweden. It is a very popular place for tourists to visit. It gets more than one million visitors every year.
When "Vasa" was brought up there were thousands of things inside her. There were bones of people, clothes, weapons, tools, coins, food and even some of the sails. The things and "Vasa" have been very good for historians, because they helps them understand how it was in Sweden in the 1600s. "Vasa" was a very expensive ship and was one of the largest in the world. She had hundreds of sculptures, and they were painted in many colors. She was a symbol of how powerful Sweden wanted to look and how good the Swedish king was.

Dover is a huge seaport. It is the easiest way to get to France except for the Channel Tunnel. This is because between Dover and Calais is the shortest distance between France and Britain. These cliffs have great symbolic value because this was often the last thing people saw of Britain before travelling to Continental Europe. This is also the site of famous historic battles. In a clear day, the cliffs can be seen from France.

One-inch boy

The one-inch boy, or Issun-bōshi, is a character in a Japanese fairy tale.
The story begins with an old, childless couple who live alone. The old woman wishes for a child, even though she's old. Eventually, a son was born to them, but their son was only an inch (2.5 centimetres) tall. They named the miniature child Issun-bōshi. The old couple takes good care of him even though he is small. One day, Issun finds out he will never grow, so he goes on a trip to seek his place in the world. He thinks he might become a good warrior, so Issun-bōshi is given a sewing needle for a sword, a soup bowl for a boat, and chopsticks for oars.
He sails down river to the city, where he asks for a job with the government and goes to the home of a rich "daimyo" (lord), whose daughter is an attractive princess. They say no because he is so tiny, but give him a job entertaining the princess. While they travel together, they are attacked by a big monster that swallows Issun-boshi. The boy defeats the monster by pricking him from within with his needle/sword. The monster spits out Issun-boshi and drops a magical Uchide's Mallet as he runs away. As a reward for his bravery, the princess uses the power of the mallet to make him grow. Issun-bōshi and the princess stay friends and get married later.

<doc id="202765" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=202765" title="Pollen tube">
Pollen tube

The pollen tube is the tube through which sperm from the pollen reaches the egg cell, and fertilises the plant to form seeds.
The pollen tube of most seed plants acts as a passageway. It transports sperm cells from the pollen grain, from the stigma (in flowering plants) to the ovules at the base of the pistil. Like ferns, other basal land plants, and many algae, some gymnosperms have flagellate sperm, which swim through a watery fluid to fertilize the egg cells.
In angiosperms the pollen tube germinates from the pollen grain and grows the entire length through the stigma, style, ovary and ovules to reach the eggs. In maize, this single cell can grow longer than 12 inches to traverse the length of the pistil. The sperm cells by themselves are not motile and are carried within the tube. As the tip of the tube reaches an egg it bursts and releases two sperm cells leading to a "double fertilization". One sperm unites with the egg cell to produce the embryo of a new plant, while a second sperm unites with the central cell (polar nuclei) to produce the endosperm of the seed. The endosperm is rich in starch, proteins and oils and is a major source of human food (e.g., wheat, barley, rye, oats, corn)

Kuchisake onna

The Kuchisake Onna, or split mouthed woman, is a popular figure in Japanese folklore. She even shows up in many modern day urban legends. She often appears wearing a surgical mask to cover her mouth, which has been ripped open from ear to ear. She will ask unknowing passers-by whether or not they think she is beautiful. Often they will say yes, and she will remove the mask, showing them her torn face and ask again. If the person says no, then she will rip their face so it resembles hers.
There are different rumors about how to avoid her killing you. One is to say she is average, and another is to ask her if you are beautiful, in hopes of confusing her so one could escape while she has to think about what to do next.
The stories of Kuchisake Onna came from the Heian period Japan, where there lived a very beautiful but very vain woman. Her husband thought she was being unfaithful to her, and cut her face out of jealousy.

The Rook is a member of the Crow family. The crows are a family in the Passerine order. 
The rook is similar in size to the crow. It has black feathers, which show a blue or bluish-purple sheen (glint) in bright sunlight. The feathers on the head, neck and shoulders are dense and silky. The legs and feet are generally black, and the bill (beak) is grey-black. 
Rooks differs from the crow by the bare grey-white skin around the base of the adult's bill, in front of the eyes. The feathering around the legs look shaggier and laxer than the Carrion Crow. The young bird looks just like a crow because it lacks the bare patch at the base of the bill.
Its food is mostly earthworms and insect larvae, which the bird finds by probing the ground with its strong bill. It also eats cultivated cereal grain, smaller amounts of fruit, small mammals, acorns, small birds, their eggs and young and carrion. 
Rooks "always nest together", usually in the very tops of the trees. Branches and twigs are broken off trees for the nests. There may be any number of nests together in a group of trees: twenty or thirty are often seen in the "rookery". This is why rooks are sometimes described as colonial birds.

If a user removes a comment from their own it should not be restored. By removing the comment the user has verified that they have read it. The comment is still in the page history, so it is not necessary to keep it visible just to show that the user received the message. It is also wrong to force them to keep it there as a sort of "Badge of Shame".
There are only four types of messages that a user should not remove: declined unblock requests while the block is still in effect, confirmed notices, miscellany for deletion tags (while the discussion is still in progress) and for unregistered editors. These templates are intended not only to communicate with the user in question but also to communicate with others.
Users should not remove only "portions" of another user's comment, nor edit their comment in any other way. This includes paraphrasing, or correcting spelling, grammar, or factual errors. Even though these actions may be well meaning, they can change the intent of the original user's comment. Indentation or re-sectioning of comments (to help identify who said what or to provide chronological context) is allowed. Removing wikilinks without removing the displayed text is also allowed, as users may not want their talk page to show up in the "what links here" special page for certain wikipedia pages.

Process

A process is a series of stages in time where the last stage is the product, result or goal. 
Processes may be "planned" or "unplanned".
A process planned by humans has a purpose. It is a course of action, or a procedure, to achieve a result, or an end-product. The sequence from start to finish is the plan. A plan may be written, or programmed, or just held in the mind. Examples include building a house, fighting a battle. sowing crops; organising a wedding.
Natural processes are not planned by humans. They are investigated and described. Examples: volcanic eruption, the evolution of the solar system; biological evolution; the melting of ice and other phase changes; the process of development from egg to adult.
Processes often repeat whenever certain conditions hold. Example: car low on petrol/gas, visit garage and refill. Most computer programs are of this type. Processes may be circular: planets revolve around sun; eggs produce chickens, and chickens produce eggs. Rain water flows into rivers, evaporates, and returns as rain.
Processes, especially those which are cyclical, may be subject to feedback. A simple case is a central heating system.

Swan Lake is a romantic ballet in four acts. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky wrote the music. In 1871 he wrote a little ballet about swans for his nieces and nephews. He used some of the music from this ballet for "Swan Lake". The story of the ballet is based on a German fairy tale. This tale was probably tweaked by Tchaikovsky and his friends during the ballet's early discussion stages.
"Swan Lake" is about a prince named Siegfried. He falls in love with the Swan princess, Odette. She is a swan by day, but a young woman at night. She is under a magic spell that can only be broken by a man who will make a promise to love her for all time. Siegfried makes the promise. He is tricked though by the magician who cast the spell. The ballet ends with the deaths of Siegfried and Odette.
The ballet was first performed on 4 March 1877 at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, Russia. Critics looked upon it as a failure for many reasons. In 1895 some changes were made to the ballet. It was then performed at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia. This time the critics thought "Swan Lake" a great success. Most performances today are based on this 1895 version.
Act 1: "1. Scène"The curtain rises on Prince Siegfried's birthday party. He is 21. On the next evening a grand ball will be held. He is to select a bride from six visiting princesses. Wolfgang, his tutor, introduces a band of peasants to the merrymakers. "2. Valse. 3. Scène." The Queen Mother enters. She thinks Siegfried is frivolous. The Queen Mother leaves. Benno encourages the Prince to continue the fun. "4. Pas de trois."Dances for the peasants. "5. Pas de deux."Dances for the merrymakers. "6. Pas d'action."Wolfgang is drunk and collapses. "7. Sujet."The sun sets. Siegfried suggests a final dance. "8. Danses des couppes."The merrymakers dance a "polonaise" holding their goblets. "9. Finale."A flock of swans flies overhead. Benno suggests a hunt. The Prince agrees. They set off.
Act 2: "10. Scène."A lake shimmering in the moonlight is seen. Siegfried and his friends watch a flock of swans glide across the lake's surface. "11. Scène."The hunters take aim. The birds are transformed into maidens. Their leader asks Siegfried why he troubles them. She says that she is the Princess Odette. She and her companions have all been changed into swans by her wicked stepmother. They are watched by her stepmother's companion Von Rothbart in the guise of an owl. Only a marriage vow can break the spell that keeps her a swan by day and a maiden by night. "12. Scène."Siegfried says he loves Odette. She promises to attend tomorrow's ball. She warns him that her stepmother is very dangerous. "13. Danses des cygnes." "14 Scène." Dawn breaks. Odette and her friends return to the lake as swans.
Act 3: Guests arrive in Siegfried's castle for the selection of the Prince's bride. "16. Danse du corps de ballet and des nains."All dance, including a group of dwarves. "17. Scène."La sortie des invités et la Valse. The six princesses arrive. "18. Scène." Siegfried does not choose a bride from among the six princesses. Von Rothbart enters with his daughter Odile. She is disguised as Odette. "19. Pas de six." The princesses dance. "20. Danse hongroise." "21. Danse espangnole." "22. Danse napolitaine." "23. Danse Mazurka." "24. Scène."Siegfried chooses Odile as his bride, believing she is Odette. Von Rothbart flees the hall as an owl. Siegfried rushes into the night to find Odette.
Act 4: "25. Entr'acte. 26. Scène."Odette's friends await her return to the lake. "27. Danse des petits cygnes. 28. Scène." Odette collapses into her companions' arms. She tells them what has happened. A storm rises. Siegfried reaches Odette. "29. Scène finale."He begs her to forgive him. She dies of grief in his arms. He throws her crown upon the waters. The waves overwhelm him. The swans are seen gliding away across the lake.
In 1871 Tchaikovsky was passing the summer in the Ukraine with his sister Alexandra Davydova. It was in her home at Kamenka that he wrote a short ballet about swans for her children to perform. The story of the ballet was based on "The Lake of Swans", a German fairy tale. Tchaikovsky used a musical theme from this children's ballet in the mature "Swan Lake". Little else is known of this ballet for children. 
In 1875 Vladimir Begitchev asked Tchaikovsky to write a ballet about swans. Begitchev was the official in charge of the repertory of the Imperial Theatres. Tchaikovsky accepted his invitation to write the ballet. He told Rimsky-Korsakov, "I accepted the work, partly because I want the money, but also because I have long had the wish to try my hand at this kind of music." In August he had completed sketches for two acts. He finished the ballet on 10 April 1876.
It is uncertain who wrote the libretto of the ballet. Both Begitchev and the dancer Vasily Geltzer were credited in the programme. They likely based it upon discussions with the artists who met at Begitchev's salon. They also used tales from Johann Musäus's "Volksmärchen der Deutschen" (178286), a collection of German fairy and folk tales.
Tchaikovsky had no experience writing ballet music for the professional theatre when he accepted Begitchev's invitation. In 1875 he began work on "Swan Lake". It was his first ballet. He studied the ballet music of other writers. He liked the music and ballets of Leo Delibes. Tchaikovsky thought Delibes's music was pretty and tuneful. Tchaikovsky however would base "Swan Lake" on a symphonic scale. Writing the music for "Swan Lake" was a way for Tchaikovsky to avoid the reality of being a homosexual in czarist Russia. Russia was a repressive state. Homosexuals were sent to prison, exiled, or banished. Symphonies did not ease the stress in the way ballet music did; he had to put too much of his inner life into symphonies. He was hired to write "Swan Lake" in May 1875. He completed the music in April 1876. The official responsible for the music at the Bolshoi Theatre thought Tchaikovsky's music impossible to understand. A "leitmotif" in Tchaikovsky's little ballet music for his nieces and nephews came to be called the "Song of the Swans". Tchaikovsky used this "leitmotif" in "Swan Lake".
John Warrack points out that Tchaikovsky put the drama in the story into music: "By making B the key of the tragedy, he initiates a musical "plot" with the dark forces of Rothbart tending to drag the tonality down into flatter keys. The main action, on the other hand, lies on the key area of A." Tchaikovsky balanced all the musical components of the work. "The divertissements are in his lightest, most appealing musical manner", Warrack writes, "The dances that further the plot have rather greater musical substance, while the scenes of narrative and action are in what was found his "symphonic" manner." Critics said Tchaikovsky's music was "too noisy, too 'Wagnerian' and too symphonic". 
Rehearsals for "Swan Lake" began before Tchaikovsky finished the score, and took place over 11 months. Everyone involved in the production had never heard such a complex score for a ballet. They described the music as "undanceable". Even the conductor threw his hands up in despair over the music.
The choreographer Julius Reisinger was incompetent, and the sets lacked a cohesiveness because they were designed by three different men. In addition, the Bolshoi Theatre was suffering at the time from problems including the lack of a ballet master who could develop a production based on the score. The role of Odette was not given to a first rate dancer but instead to a second rate talent. The reason may have been political.
"Swan Lake" was first performed on 4 March 1877 at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. Julius Reisinger designed the dances. Pauline Karpakova danced Odette. She put some numbers she liked from other ballets into "Swan Lake". The ballet was a failure. In 1883 the Bolshoi dropped the ballet from its repertory. At that time, the sets were falling apart. It was not until 1901 that Alexander Gorsky staged a new production of "Swan Lake" for the Bolshoi.
The first performance of "Swan Lake" was a disaster. Herman Laroche wrote, "I must say that I had never seen a poorer presentation on the Bolshoi stage. The costumes, decor, and machines did not hide in the least the emptiness of the dances. Not a single balletomane got out of it even five minutes of pleasure." He praised the music. He wrote that Tchaikovsky was "in excellent humour ... he was fully at the height of his genius." Tchaikovsky's brother Modest wrote, "The poverty of the production, meaning the décor and costumes, the absence of outstanding performers, the Ballet Master's weakness of imagination, and, finally, the orchestra ... all of this together permitted [Tchaikovsky] with good reason to cast the blame for the failure on others." The ballet was a moderate success with theatre-goers however. It was presented 33 times between its première at the Bolshoi in 1877 and its final performance in 1883.
Tchaikovsky died on 6 November 1893. People started to take more interest in his music after his death. Lev Ivanov was the assistant Ballet Master at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. He designed new dances for Act 2. This act was presented on 1 March 1894 in a concert at the Mariinsky in memory of Tchaikovsky. Pierina Legnani danced Odette. The revised act was a great success. It was presented again with even greater success. Marius Petipa was the Ballet Master at the Mariinsky. He was impressed with the success of these two presentations. He made the decision to stage the complete ballet at the Mariinsky. He designed the dances for Acts 1 and 3 while Ivanov designed the dances for Acts 2 and 4.
Riccardo Drigo was the conductor of the Mariinsky orchestra. He dropped some numbers from the ballet. He orchestrated three piano numbers from Tchaikovsky's Op. 72. He then put them in the ballet. These three numbers were "L'Espiègle", "Valse Bluette", and "Un poco di Chopin". He then put a number into Act 3 which he may have written himself.
Tchaikovsky's brother Modest changed the ballet's story a little for the revision. He gave the ballet a happy ending. The new "Swan Lake" was presented on 27 January 1895 at the Mariinsky. Pierina Legnani danced both Odette and Odile. The ballet was a great success. This version of the ballet is the one generally seen today.
"Swan Lake" is famous for the 32 "fouettés en tournant" in Act 3. These "fouettés" are danced at the end of the "Black Swan" "pas de deux" by the ballerina playing Odile. The "pas" was an afterthought of Tchaikovsky's. It was not included in the original production. It consists of the opening adagio followed by a variation for the male dancer. This is followed by a variation for the ballerina. The whole concludes with a brisk movement for both dancers that includes the "fouettés". Pierina Legnani first danced the "fouettés" in the Mariinsky production of 1895. Ballet-goers were uncertain about the 32 "fouettés". Some thought they were just a stunt. Others found them exciting. These ballet-goers went to every performance to count the number of turns.
"Swan Lake" became known in Europe and the United States not long after the revised version was presented at the Mariinsky Theatre in 1895. It was first presented in Europe at Prague in June 1907. It was first presented in the United States at the Metropolitan Opera House in December 1911. Diaghilev's Ballets Russes presented a two-act "Swan Lake" in London in 1911. The Ballets Russes presented a one-act version in London in 1925. The complete "Swan Lake" was first presented in England by the Sadler's Wells Ballet in November 1934. Ballerinas portraying Odette include Mathilde Kchessinska, Anna Pavlova, and Margot Fonteyn. Pavel Gerdt was the Prince Siegfried of the 1895 St. Petersburg production. Nijinsky and Rudolph Nureyev have also performed Prince Siegfried.
The score used in this comparison is Tchaikovsky's score. It may be different from Riccardo Drigo's score which is usually performed today. The titles for each number are taken from the original published score. Some of the numbers are titled simply as musical indications, those that are not are translated from their original French titles.
Moderato assai — Allegro non troppo — Tempo I
"Pas de deux for Mme. Anna Sobeshchanskaya" fashioned from the original music by Léon Minkus (AKA the "Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux")

Knock-knock joke

A Knock-knock joke is a joke told by saying "knock-knock who's there?"
The basic setup is as follows:
"Joke-Teller:" "Knock-knock!"
"Joke-Hearer:" "Who's there?"
"Teller:" "[some phrase, typically a single word]"
"Hearer:" "[repeats Teller's phrase] who?"
"Teller:" "[finishes the joke, typically a pun]"
Example:
"Joke-Teller:" "Knock-knock!"
"Joke-Hearer:" "Who's there?"
"Teller:" "Police"
"Hearer:" "Police who?"
"Teller:" "Po-lice (please) stop telling these awful knock-knock jokes!"

Adriaen Coorte

Adriaen Coorte (about 1665 – 1707) was a Dutch painter. He mainly painted 'still life'. He signed works between 1683 and 1707. Most of his paintings are small. His style is typical of Dutch 17th century still life painting. Other Dutch painters who lived at the same time had a different style of painting. Coorte was "one of the last practitioners of this intimate category".
Very little is known about his life. He was probably born in Middelburg and also died there. He became a pupil of Melchior d'Hondecoeter around 1680 in Amsterdam. From 1683 he seems to have returned to Middelburg, where he set up a workshop and signed his small, carefully balanced minimalist still lifes. He often painted on paper that was glued to a wooden panel. About 80 signed works by him have been catalogued, and nearly all of them follow the same pattern; small arrangements of fruits, vegetables, or shells on a stone slab, lit from above, with the dark background typical of still lifes earlier in the century. Instead of the Chinese or silver vessels favoured by his contemporaries, his tableware is very basic pottery. "Objects and light are studied intensely, and are painted with a wondrous tenderness". Neither his birth nor death date is certain, and archival evidence only exists in Middelburg for his membership in the Guild of St. Luke there from 1695 onwards, when he was fined for selling a painting without being a member of the guild. His works appear frequently in contemporary Middelburg taxation inventories
Coorte was probably not well known to the people who lived at the same time, outside the city of Middelburg. Much like Vermeer, he was almost entirely forgotten. In the 1950s, the Dutch art historian Laurens J. Bol revived his reputation, beginning with an article in 1952, and finally publishing the first monograph and catalogue raissone on Coorte in 1977 ("Adriaen Coorte", Amsterdam). Bol arranged an exhibition of 35 examples of Coorte's work in 1958 at the Dordrechts Museum. This became a sensation in the Netherlands; the poets Hans Faverey and Ed Leeflang were both inspired by the paintings. In 2003 there was an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art, Washington. In 2008 a new travelling exhibition was set up; "Ode to Coorte", that was nearly as successful, making Coorte the most celebrated "rediscovered" Dutch Baroque painter of recent decades.
His paintings have been compared to Spanish Bodegones, but he may also have been influenced by older painters:

Still life

A still life is a work of art, most often a painting. In a still life, objects like flowers, fruit, or glasses are arranged in a certain way, and then painted. Still life painting has been popular since the 17th century, when Dutch painters like Adriaen Coorte raised it to a fine art. However, the idea is old: examples can be found in antiquity. With a still life, the artist can focus more on composition and arrangement than with other forms of painting, such as landscape painting or portraiture.

The Portland Police Bureau is the law enforcement agency of the City of Portland, the biggest city in the U.S. state of Oregon.
The Bureau, first named the Portland Metropolitan Police Force, was created in 1870 by the Portland City Council. The Council chose Phillip Saunders as its first chief of police. He was in charge of a force with six patrolmen and one lieutenant, at a time when the population of Portland was 9,000. The first member of the force to die in the line of duty was Officer Charles F. Schoppe, who was shot to death in 1874 while trying to disarm a drunken saloon customer. On April 1, 1908, the Bureau became the first in the United States to hire a female police officer, Lola Baldwin, who became the Superintendent of its newly created Women’s Protective Division. In 1915, the "Metropolitan Police Force" changes its name to the Bureau of Police. Four years later, the Bureau becomes the first in the USA to use police radio. In 1985, Penny Harrington becomes Portland’s first woman Chief of Police, and the first to head a major U.S. police department.

Homo rhodesiensis

Homo rhodesiensis is a hominin species described from a single fossil skull. It was found in the colony of Northern Rhodesia, (now Zambia) at a mine called Broken Hill (now Kabwe) in 1921. The skull lacks the lower jaw, but otherwise is almost complete. In addition to the cranium, an upper jaw from another individual, a sacrum (bone of the pelvis), a tibia, and two femur fragments were also found. 
Rhodesian Man is dated to be between 125,000 and 300,000 years old. Cranial capacity of the Broken Hill skull has been estimated at 1,100 cm³. Bada & al (1974) published a direct date of 110 ka for this specimen. The brain size is rather small for such a late date. The destruction of the paleoanthropological site has made layered dating impossible.
The skull is from an extremely robust (= strong) individual, and has the comparatively largest brow-ridges of any known hominid remains. It was described as having a broad face similar to "Homo neanderthalensis" (i.e. large nose and thick protruding brow ridges), and has been interpreted as an "African Neanderthal". There are several features intermediate between modern "Homo sapiens" and Neanderthals. Most current experts believe Rhodesian Man to be within the group of "Homo heidelbergensis". Other names, such as Archaic "Homo sapiens" and "Homo sapiens rhodesiensis", have also been suggested.

<doc id="203521" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=203521" title="Homo georgicus">
Homo georgicus

Homo georgicus is a species of "Homo" that was proposed in 2002. It is based on fossil skulls and jaws found in Dmanisi, Georgia in 1999 and 2001, which seem intermediate between "Homo habilis" and "H. erectus". 
A partial skeleton was discovered in 2001. The fossils are about 1.8 million years old. The remains were first discovered in 1991 by Georgian scientist, David Lordkipanidze, accompanied by an international team which unearthed the remains. Implements and animal bones were found alongside the ancient human remains.
At first, scientists thought they had found mandibles and skulls belonging to "Homo ergaster", but size differences led them to name a new species.
At around 600 cm³ brain volume, the skull D2700 is dated to 1.77 million years old and it is in good condition. The cranium was the smallest and most primitive Hominin skull ever discovered outside of Africa.
In Africa, the "Australopithecines" and early "Homo" represent two distinctive evolutionary paths sharing a common ancestor. In Georgia the specimens, with a brain half the size of anatomically modern humans, were the smallest found until the discovery of "Homo floresiensis" on the island of Flores in 2003.
There is a strong sexual dimorphism present, with males being significantly larger than females. This is a primitive trait, less obvious in more recent human species in Europe (i.e. "Homo antecessor", "Homo heidelbergensis" and "Homo neanderthalensis").
The small size of this species contrasts with the much larger size of "Homo erectus". "H. georgicus" was the first species of "Homo" to settle in Europe, some 800,000 years before "H. erectus".
Later, four fossil skeletons were found, showing a species primitive in its skull and upper body but with relatively advanced spines and lower limbs, providing greater mobility. They are now thought to represent a stage soon after the transition between "Australopithecus" and "Homo erectus", and have been dated at 1.8 million years before the present. The assemblage includes one of the largest Pleistocene Homo mandibles (D2600), one of the smallest Lower Pleistocene mandibles (D211), a nearly complete sub-adult (D2735), and a specimen without teeth (D3900).
"H. georgicus" is often classified as Homo erectus georgicus. The classical textbook definition of "H. erectus" included a brain size range of between 9001150 ccs. If the "georgicus" specimens and the Flores specimens ("Homo floresiensis") are included in "H. erectus", then the range of brain capacities is two-fold, from 600 ccs to 1150 ccs. Also, "Homo ergaster" is also considered by some to be a subspecies of "H. erectus". Size has something to do with it: both the "georgicus" and "floriensis" were much smaller than the classic "erectus", which was as tall as modern man. The classification of all these species or subspecies is provisional at present, and still being debated.

Chicxulub crater

The Chicxulub crater is a very big crater. Some scientists believe that the Chicxulub crater was made by the meteor that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, and many other animals. It is near the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. 
The Chicxulub crater is more than 180 km (110 mi) in diameter, making it the third largest confirmed impact crater. The bolide which formed the crater was at least 10 km (6 mi) in diameter.
Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas. The age of the rocks and isotope analysis show that this impact structure dates from the end of the Cretaceous period, roughly 65 million years ago. The impact associated with the crater is implicated in causing the extinction of the dinosaurs. 
A 2007 study suggests that the impactor may have been a piece of a much larger asteroid that broke up in a collision and also produced 298 Baptistina, 160 million years ago.
In March 2010, following analysis of the available evidence covering 20 years' worth of data in the fields of palaeontology, geochemistry, climate modelling, geophysics and sedimentology, 41 international experts from 33 institutions reviewed available evidence and concluded that the impact at Chicxulub triggered the mass extinctions during K-T boundary including those of dinosaurs.

Ruslan Ponomariov

Ruslan Ponomariov (, born 11 October 1983) is a Ukrainian chess player and former FIDE world champion.
In 2002 he beat his fellow countryman Vassily Ivanchuk in the final of the FIDE World Championship 2002 by a score of 4½–2½. This made him FIDE world champion at the age of 18, the first teenager and youngest person to win this form of the title. However, he is not the youngest undisputed world champion because the traditional World Chess Championship was still held by Vladimir Kramnik. 
In the same year he finished second in the very strong Linares tournament, behind Garry Kasparov. His result in the strong 2003 Corus tournament at Wijk aan Zee was not as good – despite having the third highest rating, he finished only joint eleventh out of fourteen players with 6/13, and at Linares the same year he finished only fifth out of seven with 5½/12.
There were plans for him to play a fourteen-game match against Kasparov in Yalta in September 2003, the winner of which would go on to play the winner of a match between Kramnik and Péter Lékó as part of the so-called "Prague Agreement" to reunify the World Chess Championship (from 1993 until 2006 there were two world chess championships). However, this was called off after Ponomariov refused to sign his contract without reservation. 
Ponomariov remained FIDE champion until Rustam Kasimdzhanov won the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004.

Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis is the weakening of bones in the body. It is caused by lack of calcium deposited in the bones. This lack of calcium causes the bones to become brittle. They break easily. Side effects include limping. Some symptoms late in the disease include pain in the bones, living in a wheelchair, and lower back pain due to spinal bone fractures. It is more likely for a woman to get osteoporosis than a man. Elderly people are more likely to develop osteoporosis than younger people. The amount of calcium in the bones decreases as a person gets older. There are three kinds of osteoporosis.
There is no cure for osteoporosis. A person can keep it from happening by exercising and taking the right amount of calcium each day. 75 million people in the United States, Japan, and Europe have osteoporosis. 30 million people in the US have poor bone density. Vitamin D, calcium, and exercise are the three main things for healthy bones. Consuming too much alcohol and caffeine can cause an increase in the risk of weak bones. Too much salt increases the amount of calcium lost in urine. This is bad because calcium makes bones strong. People should not take iron and calcium supplements at the same time. This is because calcium competes with the absorption of minerals such as iron.

Issler's Orchestra

Issler's Orchestra was probably the first band that became famous because of the records they made.
In or shortly before 1888, music teacher and pianist Edward Issler (1855 - ?) started a four-piece band. The instruments were piano, cornet, flute, and violin. Their first recordings were made in 1888 for Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the phonograph, the first device that could record and play back sound.
Soon, more instruments were added, including the trombone and clarinet, but the band started losing popularity to larger groups. After a client (Columbia) of the company Issler recorded most for (the United States Phonograph Co. of Newark, NJ) started its own studio orchestra, the band faded away. They made their last recordings in 1900, although they may have continued performing into the early 1900s.
The band's four core members were:
All of Issler's records were recorded on fragile hollow cylinders made of a waxy blend of materials that usually became brown-colored during the making of the blank cylinders, so they are called "brown wax cylinders" because of their shape and usual color. Their actual color can be anywhere from nearly white to a very dark brown. They are about 4¼ inches long and 2¼ inches in diameter. Not many cylinder records made in the 1890s have survived and the survivors are almost never in like-new condition, so the sound recorded on them is now less clear than what people heard when they were new and there is much more noise mixed in with it.

Eggs Benedict

Eggs Benedict is a dish usually served at breakfast. It starts with a lightly toasted English muffin. The muffin is topped with cooked bacon or Canadian bacon, and poached eggs. The dish is completed with a small amount of hollandaise sauce. Many variations on the dish exist. There are several stories about the origin of Eggs Benedict.
There are several stories about how Eggs Benedict started.
In an interview in "The New Yorker" magazine in 1942, Lemuel Benedict, a retired Wall Street stock broker, said that he had wandered into the Waldorf Hotel in 1894 and, hoping to find a cure for his morning hangover, ordered "buttered toast, poached eggs, crisp bacon and a hooker of hollandaise." Oscar Tschirky, the "maître d'hôtel", was so impressed with the dish that he put it on the breakfast and luncheon menus but substituted ham and a toasted English muffin for the bacon and toast.
Craig Claiborne, in September 1967, wrote a column in "The New York Times Magazine" about a letter he had received from Edward P. Montgomery, an American living in France. In it, Montgomery related that the dish was created by Commodore E.C. Benedict, a banker and yachtsman, who died in 1920 at the age of 86. Montgomery also included a recipe for eggs Benedict, stating that the recipe had been given to him by his mother, who had received it from her brother, who was a friend of the Commodore.
Mabel C. Butler of Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts in a November 1967 letter printed in "The New York Times Magazine" responded to Montgomery's claim by correcting that the "true story, well known to the relations of Mrs. Le Grand Benedict", of whom she was one, was:
Dates given refer to date of publication.
1898 — In "Eggs, and how to use them", a recipe for eggs Benedict is given as "split and toast some small muffins; put on each a nice round slice of broiled ham, and on the ham the poached egg; pour over some Hollandaise sauce"
1900 — In "The Connecticut Magazine: an Illustrated Monthly, Volume VI", a recipe for eggs Benedict is given as "A third variety is called Eggs Benedict. Broil a thin slice of cold-boiled ham cut the size of a small baker's loaf; toast a slice of bread, butter it and moisten with a little water; lay the ham on it and on that a poached egg. Serve individually."
1907 — In "Many Ways for Cooking Eggs", a recipe for eggs Benedict is given that starts with the muffins. Unlike yeast leavened English muffins, the recipe muffins use baking powder and beaten egg whites for leavening; however, they are still baked on a griddle in muffin rings. The remainder of the recipe reads "Broil thin slices of ham. Make a sauce Hollandaise. Chop a truffle. Poach the required number of eggs. Dish the muffins, put a square of ham on each, then a poached egg and cover each egg nicely with sauce Hollandaise. Dust with truffle and serve at once."
1914 — In the 1914 printing of the "The Neighborhood Cook Book", a recipe for eggs Benedict is given as "Place a slightly fried piece of ham on a piece of toast, place poached egg on ham, and pour over all a Hollandaise sauce."
1918 — In the 1918 printing of the "Boston Cooking-School Cook Book", a recipe for Eggs à la Benedict is given as "Split and toast English muffins. Sauté circular pieces of cold boiled ham, place these over the halves of muffins, arrange on each a dropped egg, and pour around Hollandaise Sauce II, diluted with cream to make of such consistency to pour easily."
1919 — In "The Hotel St. Francis Cook Book", a recipe for eggs Benedict is given as "Cut an English muffin in two, toast, and put on platter. Put a slice of broiled ham on top of each half, a poached egg on top of the ham, cover all with Hollandaise, and lay a slice of truffle on top of the sauce."
1938 — An advertisement for "Haill Hayden's Hollandaise" — a bottled hollandaise sold in a 6 ounce jar for 50¢ — runs in "The New York Times". "Here is a sauce such as no man has had before. On tasting it, great chefs have broken their egg-beaters over their knees and wept in jealousy! It is made of butter fragrant from timothy and alfalfa, eggs to which their mothers are still clucking at this hour, lemon and pungent spices! It is not profaned with a drop of oil or any substitutes. Serve it over cauliflower, artichokes, lettuce, eggs Benedict, fish, singing 'Broccoli, Broccoli,' as you eat".
1942 — In an interview in "The New Yorker", Lemuel Benedict claims to have originated the dish with an order at the Waldorf Hotel, hoping for a hangover cure.
1967 — Craig Claiborne writes in "The New York Times Magazine" that Edward P. Montgomery wrote him a letter to say that eggs Benedict originated with Commodore E.C. Benedict.
1967 — In a letter printed in "The New York Times Magazine", Mabel C. Butler responds to Montgomery's claim by stating that Mrs. Le Grand Benedict originated the dish with an order at Delmonico's.
1978In the Neil Simon comedy film California Suite, Maggie Smith, who won best supporting actress award, laments that she cant get Eggs Benedict late at night, staying in the exclusive 5 star hotel she is in, playng in fact, an academy award losing actress as a part.
Later editions of Charles Ranhofer’s cookbook "The Epicurean" contain a recipe for “Eggs à la Benedick”; however, the recipe is not present in the original 1894 edition. Save for a hiatus from 1876 to 1879, Charles Ranhofer was the chef at Delmonico's from 1862 till his retirement in 1896.

Encyclopaedia Hebraica

The Encyclopaedia Hebraica () is an encyclopedia in Hebrew. It was started in 1948.
The encyclopedia was published by Bracha Peli who had already created another encyclopedia. The man in charge was her son who was named Alexander.
A committee decided the aims of the encyclopedia in 1944. Printing of the first part began in 1948. This was the year that Israel became a country. The president of the encyclopedia project was also the President of Israel, Professor Chaim Weizmann. The first photograph in the encyclopaedia was of Israel's Declaration of Independence.
The first volume covered the entries for the letter "Aleph" (א) to Australia.
The introduction said:
... we will finish publishing all 16 volumes within five or six years...
The writing took more than thirty years. The encyclopedia had thirty-two volumes when it was finished. An Index (publishing)|index was not printed until 1985. In 1995 there were large updates of entries dealing with the State of Israel.
The supervisor was always Alexander Plai. Its editors were Joseph Klausner, Benzion Netanyahu, Yeshayahu Leibowitz, Nathan Rotenstreich, Yehoshua Gutman, and Joshua Prawer. More than 2500 people wrote the encyclopedia.
Some people felt it was very important to be included in the encyclopedia. They would ask the editors to make sure they had an article about them. Other articles caused arguments e.g. Adolf Hitler.
The Schocken Publishing House has been working on a new edition of the encyclopedia.
The "Encyclopaedia Hebraica" said it was about "General, Jewish, and Israeli" ideas. The encyclopaedia covers all the general topics, but the articles were larger on Judaism, Jews, and Israel. The encyclopaedia includes the Jewishness of the person, even when it is not important.
Articles on countries and cities include their history and then a Jewish history. For places which were under Nazi rule an account is given of the Jewish people during the Holocaust.
Writers of the encyclopaedia did not hide their Jewish views. The Kingdom of Jordan was not in the first edition. Instead Jordan was included in the article "Land of Israel,".
The letter Aleph contains the largest number of articles. The longest article is "Land of Israel" which takes all of volume 6.
Next in size is "United States of America". The large size of the aleph articles reflects the enthusiasm of the early editors. It became clear that the encyclopaedia would never come to an end. The plan was changed. The final size of the encyclopaedia was smaller than planned.
The woman who owned it was Bracha Peli. She died in 1986. In 1997 the encyclopedia was sold to another company.

Milkweed

The milkweeds, Asclepias (L. 1753), are a genus of herbaceous perennial, dicotyledonous plants that contains over 140 known species.
Milkweeds are an important nectar source for bees and other nectar eaters, and a food source for caterpillars. The weeds are eaten by caterpillars of the monarch butterfly and its relatives, and by other herbivorous insects (such as beetles, and true bugs). These insects are able to feed on the plants despite their chemical defences. Milkweed is named after its milky sap, which contains alkaloids, latex, and several other complex compounds. Some species are toxic.
Pollination in this genus is accomplished in an unusual manner, as the pollen is grouped into pollen sacs. The feet or mouthparts of flower visiting insects such as bees, wasps and butterflies, slip into one of the five slits in each flower formed by adjacent anthers. The bases of the pollinia then mechanically attach to the insect, pulling a pair of pollen sacs free when the pollinator flies off. Pollination is effected by the reverse procedure in which one of the pollinia becomes trapped within the anther slit.
Milkweeds have three defenses to limit damage by caterpillars and other insects: hairs on the leaves, toxins, and latex fluids. Some more recent milkweed species grow faster than older species. They have the potential to grow faster than caterpillars can eat them. Caterpillars which eat milkweeds, and their adult butterflies, may be protected by the foul taste of the milkweed chemicals. Such butterflies and caterpillars usually show warning colors (see mimicry#warning coloration).

Chaim Weizmann

Chaim Azriel Weizmann, (Russia, November 1874 – Israel, 9 November 1952) was the first President of Israel. 
Weizmann came to the University of Manchester in 1904, where he lectured on chemistry. During World War I, the British forces needed to increase the production of artillery shells. The production was limited by a shortage of acetone, needed to produce cordite. Cordite was used to propel (fire) shells and bullets to their targets. Weizmann developed a production of acetone from the anaerobic fermentation of maize and horse chestnuts by bacteria. As a result, the production of shells rose from 500,000 in the first five months of the war to 16.4 million in 1915.
Weizmann was President of Israel from 1948, and he died in 1952. He had worked for years to get agreement for the Israel.

Natural History Museum

The Natural History Museum (NHM) is a museum in London. It is the largest natural history museum in Britain. It includes the nation's main collections of specimens of life, rocks and minerals. The museum employs scientific staff, conducts research, stores specimens, and manages the public galleries.
The NHM is one of the four large institutions on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, London. The others are the Science Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and Imperial College London.
The NHM was at first a department of the famous British Museum. When the present NHM building was opened in 1881, it was then called the "British Museum (Natural History)" or BMNH. Its head reported to the Director of the British Museum. Not until 1963 did the NHM become fully independent, with its own Board of Trustees, and not until 1992 was it permitted to use its present name.
In 1986, the museum absorbed the adjacent Geological Museum of the British Geological Survey, which is to just to the north of the NHM. The museum's galleries were completely rebuilt and relaunched in 1996 as "The Earth Galleries", with the exhibitions in the Waterhouse building retitled "The Life Galleries". The Natural History Museum's own Mineralogy displays remain largely unchanged as an example of the 19th-century display techniques of the Waterhouse building.
The newly-developed "Darwin Centre" (named after Charles Darwin) is designed as a new home for the museum's collection of tens of millions of preserved specimens, and new work spaces for the museum's scientific staff. Built in two phases, with two new buildings adjacent to the main Waterhouse building, it is the most important new project in the museum's history. 
The museum employs 300 scientific staff, and has huge collections of fossils, rocks and minerals, as well as the preserved specimens of present-day plants and animals. There are over 70 million specimens in the collections. Data bases of the collections are being developed.

Edaphosaurus

Edaphosaurus was a pelycosaur (early Synapsida) that lived during the later Carboniferous and early Permian. It was a herbivorous relative of the well-known "Dimetrodon". Both had a large, thermal regulating sail on the back. Fossils of
"Edaphosaurus" have been found in Europe and North America. 
"Edaphosaurus" species measured from to almost in length and weighed over 300 kilograms (660 lb). It was slightly taller and stockier than "Dimetrodon", but like its pelycosaur relatives had a small head and a long tail.
The head of "Edaphosaurus" was rather small for its body size. The deep lower jaw likely had powerful muscles and the teeth along the front and sides of its jaws could crop bite-sized pieces from tough plants. 
The roof of the mouth and the inside of the lower jaw had batteries of peglike teeth. They were a crushing and grinding surface. Early descriptions suggested that "Edaphosaurus" fed on molluscs, which it crushed with its teeth plates. However, paleontologists now think that "Edaphosaurus" ate plants. Lack of wear on the teeth suggests "limited processing of food". Earlier members of the Edaphosauridae lacked tooth plates, and ate insects.

Mesonychid

Mesonychids were the first mammalian carnivores after the extinction of the dinosaurs.
These "wolves on hooves" are an extinct order of carnivorous mammals, closely related to artiodactyls.
Mesonychids first appeared in the early Palaeocene with the genus "Dissacus". They went in decline at the end of the Eocene, and became extinct in the early Oligocene.
At the start of the Palaeocene, there were (so far as we know) no large carnivores on land. The surviving mammals and birds evolved into many of the ecological niches previously occupied by dinosaurs and pterosaurs. This process is called adaptive radiation. The mesonychids were the first group to become larger carnivores.
They soon had competition. By the later Palaeocene there were several other groups of land carnivores. The giant flightless bird "Gastornis" appeared in the Upper Palaeocene, and the Creodonts had also evolved. The Creodonts became an important order, and would certainly have been serious competitors of the mesonychids.
Most important of all, the modern order Carnivora became significant in the Eocene. They were a sister group to the mesonychids, and started as small forms in the Palaeocene. Once they increased in size they would have been direct competitors of the mesonychids.
The broken-up Gondwana gave rise to southern continents which the early placental mammals could not get to. Africa and India eventually bumped into Eurasia, and South America sometimes had land connection to North America. All this lead to 'faunal interchange'. Australasia developed its own carnivores, which became extinct only in modern times.
Large size was common. The famous "Andrewsarchus" had a skull a metre long, which is much larger than that of the modern Kodiak bear.
Mesonychid teeth consisted of molars which were laterally compressed and often blunt and were probably used for shearing meat or crushing bones. Many species are suspected of being fish-eaters, and the largest species may have been scavengers.

Andrewsarchus

Andrewsarchus mongoliensis (Andrews + Greek ἀρχός, "ruler"), was a mammalian Mesonychid predator.
This large heavily-built, wolf-like, mammal lived during the Eocene, about 45 to 36 million years ago. It walked on four short legs and had a long body, a long tail, and feet with hoofed toes. It had a long snout with large, sharp teeth and flat cheek teeth that may have been used to crush bones. 
Because "Andrewsarchus" is only known from a skull and a few other bones, whether it was an active predator or merely a large scavenger is open to debate, as is its exact time range.

Eurolang

Eurolang is an international planned language created by Philip Hunt between 1995 and 1998 in order to be a language for the European Union. The author stated as a principle of the design that the language should be very easy to learn for Europeans. In contrast with other languages like Esperanto, Eurolang includes a large number of words directly borrowed from English.
At present there's no known community of active speakers of Eurolang. The website of the author in which he described the language has disappeared from the net.
"Eurolang est actifacta lang, qui me creatab estar comuna 2a lang per la Europa Unized (EU). Its word-list est baseda super England-lang, Deutsh-lang, France-lang, Italia-lang, Espanja-lang et Latin. Me desinab it estar facila lernar et usar."

Molar conductivity

Molar conductivity is a scientific term. The molar conductivity of an electrolyte is a measure of how well it conducts electricity in solution. It is calculated by dividing the conductivity (how well the electrolyte conducts electricity) by the molar concentration (how much the electrolyte is diluted: a solution means that it has been dissolved in something else: see solution). It is measured in siemens per metre per molarity. The symbol for molar conductivity is Λ, or Λm.

Mingora

Mingora is the largest city in Swat District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. It lies on the banks of River Swat about 2 km from Saidu Sharif, the capital of Swat.
In 1998 the population of Mingora was about 175,000. The city was once a major tourist destination and was described by Queen Elizabeth as the "Switzerland" of the former British Empire. 
However because of the Taliban, tourism has suffered due to fighting between the Taliban and the government. In March 2009 the city came under Taliban rule due to a peace agreement with the government. But the agreement was soon broken and in May 2009 the government were fighting with the Taliban to end their occupation of the city.

Glass lizard

Glass lizards, or glass snakes, are a genus of reptiles that look like snakes. Although most species have no legs, their head shapes, movable eyelids, and external ear openings show they are lizards. A few species have very small, stub-like legs near their rear vent (cloaca). These are vestigial organs. 
Most described species are native to Asia, a few occur in North America, and at least one can be found in North Africa.
Like many lizards, they have the ability to drop off part of the tail when attacked. It can break into several pieces, like glass. The tail stays mobile, distracting the predator, while the lizard keeps still.

Palm Beach, Florida

The Town of Palm Beach is an incorporated town in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. The Intracoastal Waterway separates it from the cities of West Palm Beach and Lake Worth. As of 2004, 9,860 people lived there. 
Palm Beach began as a resort town when Henry Morrison Flagler, a founder of Standard Oil, built the Florida East Coast Railway down the coast of Florida. In the center of the community, Flagler built two luxury resort hotels, the Royal Poinciana Hotel and The Breakers Hotel. West Palm Beach was built across Lake Worth as a service town, and is now a major city.
Flagler's land for houses was bought by people active in the Gilded Age, and in 1902 Flagler himself built a Beaux-Arts mansion named Whitehall, designed by the New York–based firm Carrère and Hastings and helped start the Palm Beach winter "season" by entertaining visitors. The town was incorporated on April 17, 1911.
An area known as the Styx housed many of the servants, most of whom were black. The workers rented their small houses from the landowners. In the early 1900s the land owners agreed to evict all of the residents of the Styx (who moved to West Palm Beach) and Edward R. Bradley bought up much of this land.

<doc id="204876" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=204876" title="Homosociality">
Homosociality

Homosociality is a term used in sociology, which describes a same-sex relationship which is not romantic or sexual in nature. These relationships might be called friendships, mentorships, or other. Heterosociality is the opposite. It means that one prefers socializing with members of the opposite sex without bringing romance or sex into the relationship. Eve Sedgwick made the term popular in her discussion of male homosocial desire, but Jean Lipman-Blumen had defined homosociality in 1976 as a preference for members of one's own sex.
For example, a close relationship between two men (such as George and Lennie in "Of Mice and Men" (and indeed most of the characters in that book) would be a homosocial relationship. It can apply to single sex schools, prisons, monasteries, but also to simple friendships.
The relationship "can" be a sexual one, but a homosocial relationship can occur between homosexuals, heterosexuals or both.
It is often used to describe the all-male world of medieval knights, or sailors. While it can apply to both men or women, it is most commonly used to refer to men.
Rose surveyed males and females between the ages of 20 and 28. Rose asked men and women about how they felt about same and cross-sex friendships. Both men and women preferred same sex friendships. Both men and women said that cross-sex relationships were less helpful, and less loyal than same-sex friendships. Friendship formation was found to be different between cross-sex and same-sex relationships as well. 
Depending on the culture, and family and social stuctures, same-sex preferences have been found to develop between 3 and 9 years old. (LaFreniere, Strayer,& Gauthier, 1984; Jacklin& Maccoby, 1978; Harkness & Super, 1985) LaFreniere, Strayer, and Gauthier (1984) conducted a three year long study observing fifteen peer groups between the ages of 1 to 6 years old, with 98 boys and 93 girls. As they looked into sex-segregation in childhood, the researchers found that segregation rose with age and that most Western children exihibit these preferences around 3–4 years old. However, in a study by Harkenss and Super, Kenyan children do not have sex-preference in playmates until the ages of 6 to 9 years old. Researchers observed 152 Kenyan children in rural settings and found that this change didn’t occur until parental expectations and customary duties increased. “Just when and how such gender segration appears, is the joint product of the individual and the culturally constructed niche” (Harkness & Super, 1985).
The social bias towards members of one’s own sex can develop early in children. Specifically, studies have found that by the early age of 3 or 4, children prefer members of their own sex to members of the opposite sex (Bussey & Bandura, 1992). That is, young girls favor other females (girls and women) over males (boys and men). The findings are identical for young boys. Also, Carol Martin (1989) found that boys 4.5 years of age expressed significantly more dislike for a girl depicted as a “tomboy” than a boy depicted as a “sissy”; whereas boys 8.5 years of age express more dislike for a boy depicted as a “sissy”. This age difference suggests that children as young as 4 prefer their own sex regardless of gender-incongruent behavior. Around the age of 8 however, boys begin to show males—devaluing feminine behavior. It has also been shown that children ages 10–12 prefer same-sex socializing. That is, girls favored girls who socialized with other girls and boys liked boys who socialized with other boys.
Homosociality, by definition, implies neither heterosexuality nor homosexuality. For example, a heterosexual male who prefers to socialize with men may be considered a homosocial heterosexual. The term is often used by feminists to emphasize aspects of solidarity between males. Feminists also identify a close link between female homosociality, feminism and lesbian desire, with Audre Lorde stating "the true feminist deals out of a lesbian consciousness whether or not she ever sleeps with women."

Girls' Generation

Girls' Generation (Hangul: 소녀시대; Hanja: 少女時代) is a pop group made up of nine members that was formed by SM Entertainment in 2007. Girls' Generation members are Yoona, Tiffany, Yuri, Hyoyeon, Sooyoung, Seohyun, Taeyeon (who is the group's leader), and Sunny. Jessica was a member, but in 2014, she left the group. Fans usually call the group SNSD, which is a short-form of the group's Korean name, So Nyeo Shi Dae (or So Nyuh Shi Dae). Their fans are called "S♡NE" (소원), and is pronounced as "So-won", which means "wish" in Korean.
Each member of the group was trained in singing and dancing before their debut, while some others were trained in acting and modelling. Some girls had already appeared in television advertisements, music videos of other music groups and acted in dramas as well, before Girls' Generation started.
Girls' Generation first performed on M.net "M! Countdown" in July 2007. Even though their performances were never played on television, videos of their performances were posted on the Internet. The girls performed "Into the New World"(), which became their single. "M.Net's Girls Go To School" was filmed during this time, to show how the girls made their debut. The show ended after 9 episodes, when they finally appeared on another show, "School of Rock".
In August 2007, the single "Into the New World" was released. This single included two other songs, "Beginning" and "Perfect for You" (), later renamed as Honey for their debut album "Girls' Generation". An instrumental of "Into the New World" was also put in the album.
After the single was released, the group started to promote it. Girls' Generation performed their single on SBS's "Inkigayo", MBC's "Show! Music Core", and on KBS's "Music Bank".
After a short break, the group's first full album was released in late autumn 2007, with the lead single "Girls' Generation" (), a cover of Lee Seung-Chul ()'s hit song in the 1980s. Promotion for the single started in early November. "Girls' Generation" was became popular, and the album has sold 121,143 copies to date, placing 8th in the year-end charts. In early 2008, Girls' Generation began promoting their third single, "Kissing You". The music video featured Donghae from Super Junior. This song achieved the #1 spot in the three main TV music rankings—SBS "Inkigayo", M.net "M.Countdown!" and KBS "Music Bank".
In March 2008, the album was re-released and re-titled "Baby Baby". A third single, "Baby Baby", was used to promote the album. A digital EP featuring Jessica, Tiffany, and Seohyun was released on April 2008, titled "Roommate". The single from the mini-album is "Oppa Nappa" (, literally "Bad Brother", although contextually it refers to an older male friend).
Girls' Generation, along with fellow artists such as BoA, TVXQ, Super Junior, CSJH the Grace, Zhang Liyin, SHINee and other SM artists participated in SM Town Live '08. The tour went on to South Korea, Thailand, and China.
In 2008, M.net announced that the group would be starring in a reality TV show called "Factory Girl", in which the girls work as interns at fashion megazine "Elle", writing articles for the magazine.
During their break from music, they appeared in many television advertisements for MapleStory and Mabinogi.
Later, it was announced that the group's first mini-album, "Gee", would be released in January 2009.
A teaser video was released in January 2009 and the first single "Gee" was released soon after. People became interested in the song rose after the digital release, and the song became #1 Cyworld's hourly music chart on the release day. The song also went #1 on all major digital music charts within two days.
The group began to promote the album in January 2009 on MBC "Show! Music Core". They sang their new single, "Gee", and "Him Nae/Way To Go", another track from the Gee mini-album. This song is a remake of the song "Haptic Motion" that was used in cellphone advertisements and is a mix of bubblegum pop and punk rock. However, the group did not appear on KBS's "Music Bank" with "Gee", even after winning #1 on the music chart show.
"Gee" is the record holder for the longest-running #1 on music portal M.net (for 8 weeks), surpassing the previous record of 6 weeks set by the Wonder Girls' "Nobody".
They also broke the record on KBS's music show "Music Bank" by being #1 for 9 consecutive weeks, previously set by Jewelry's "One More Time, which had 7 wins. They won the award for best-selling song for the first half of 2009 for "Gee". The group stopped promoting the song at the end of March 2009.
After a short break, SM Entertainment announced that the girls would be back with a new single and showing a "Marine Girl" concept; the song, titled "Sowoneul Malhaebwa (Genie)" (, literally "Tell Me Your Wish"), the mini album was released digitally on June 22, 2009. The mini-album includes a duet between Jessica and Shinee member Onew called "One Year Later". During the group's promotion, the girls would be seen wearing marine uniforms as part of the album's concept.
On May 3, 2009. Girls Generation was starred in their new reality show "SNSD Horror Movie factory", with the premier episode receiving a viewership rating of 3.3%. The show was then cancelled after 6 episodes due to low ratings from the public.

Basilosaurus

Basilosaurus is a genus of cetacean that lived from 40 to 34 million years ago in the Late Eocene. The first "Basilosaurus" fossils were found in Louisiana, USA, but another species was soon discovered preserved in large numbers in the Fayum deposits of Egypt.
The first fossil of "B. cetoides" was discovered in the United States and was initially believed to be some sort of reptile, hence the suffix -"saurus", but it was later found to be a marine mammal. Richard Owen wanted to rename the creature Zeuglodon ("yoked tooth"), but by taxonomic rules the creature's first name remained permanent. Fossils of "B. isis" have been found in Egypt and Jordan. "B. drazindai" was described based on a single vertebra found in Pakistan.
Far from being a marine reptile, "Basilosaurus" is a stage in the evolution of whales. At 40–65 ft (12–20 m), "Basilosaurus cetoides" was one of the largest oceanic animals of its time.

Pakicetus

Pakicetus is a genus of extinct cetaceans found in the early Eocene (55.8 ± 0.2 - 33.9 ± 0.1 Ma) of Pakistan, hence their name. The strata where the fossils were found was then part of the coast of the Tethys Sea.
The first fossil, a lone skull, was thought to be a mesonychid, but Gingerich and Russell recognized it as an early cetacean from characteristic features of the inner ear, found only in cetaceans: the large auditory bulla is formed from the ectotympanic bone only. This suggests that it is a transitional species between extinct land mammals and modern cetaceans.
Complete skeletons were discovered in 2001, revealing that "Pakicetus" was primarily a land animal, about the size of a wolf, and very similar in form to the related mesonychids.

Ed Derwinski

Edward Joseph Derwinski (born September 15, 1926; died January 15, 2012) was an American politician who served as the first Cabinet-level United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs, serving under President George H. W. Bush from March 15, 1989, to September 26, 1992. Before that, he was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1959 to 1983, representing the south and southwest suburbs of Chicago.
Derwinski served in the United States Army in the Pacific Theater during World War II and in the postwar U.S. occupation of Japan. He graduated from Loyola University Chicago in 1951. He was a member of the Alpha Delta Gamma Fraternity. In 1957 he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives, where he served one term before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1958. He served 12 terms as a Republican representative from the 4th District of Illinois, a suburban region south and west of Chicago, eventually becoming the ranking member of the House Foreign Relations Committee. He also served as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly from 1971-1972 and as chairman of the U.S. delegation to the Interparliamentary Union from 1970-1972 and 1978-1980.
A Democratic redistricting plan after the 1980 Census split up the 4th District, with only about 15% of its area remaining and added to various areas from other districts; Derwinski and Republican congressman George M. O'Brien were placed in the same district, and O'Brien won the 1982 primary on the strength of having more of his previous district included in the new change. After Derwinski's loss, President Ronald Reagan picked him to be Counselor to the State Department. In 1987, Reagan picked him to be Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance, Science and Technology, where he served until the end of Reagan's term. Not long after that, he was picked by George H.W. Bush to head the VA.
Derwinski lived in Glen Ellyn, Illinois with his wife, the former Bonita Hickey. He had two adult children from his first marriage to Patricia Derwinski, Maureen and Michael.

Metamorphism

Metamorphism, in geology, is the change of the structure, texture, or composition of rocks. (an aggregation of solid matter composed of one or more of the minerals forming the earth's crust).
The scientific study of rocks is called petrology.
Rocks are commonly divided, according to their origin, into three major classes—Igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. They are caused by the effects of heat, deforming pressure, shearing stress, hot/chemically active fluids, or a combination of these. All of these changes occur while the rock remains essentially in the solid state. In theory, rocks are formed when the things surrounding them are in equilibrium with ambient physical conditions. If the conditions are changed by movements in the earth's crust or by igneous activity, metamorphism occurs to reestablish equilibrium and changes the physical character of the rock mass.

Embassy of Russia in Copenhagen

The Embassy of Russia in Copenhagen is the embassy of Russia to Denmark. The embassy building is located at Kristianiagade 5 in Indre Østerbro, Copenhagen. The building is heritage listed.
In 1897, Otto Mønsted, a Danish businessman and margarine magnate, purchased three pieces of land in Østerbro, Copenhagen and hired architect Vilhelm Dahlerup to design a villa. Dahlerup, who specialised in Italian Renaissance style design had previously designed the Hotel D’Angleterre, Jesus Church in Valby, National Gallery, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, amongst others. Completed in 1899, the building of the mansion cost Mønsted half a million krone.
The entrance was decorated with a monogram with the initials AOM (for Anna-Otto-Mønsted). The Mønsteds kept a large staff in their mansion. Gardeners creating a large garden. In the garage Mønsted kept Copenhagen's most expensive car. The Mønsteds also bred Scottish hunting dogs and kept race horses in the barn.
In 1934 Anna Mønsted sold the mansion for 265,000 krone to Countess Musse Scheel. Scheel was a Danish actress and became the last private owner of the mansion. Scheel was an animal lover and was regarded as being eccentric. Scheel kept a hen house in the yard and sold eggs to her neighbours.
During the occupation of Denmark by Nazi Germany the mansion was the headquarters of the "Northern Society". The Northern Society promoted cultural co-operation between Nazi Germany and the Nordic countries.
In 1950, the Soviet Union signed a contract leasing the mansion for 20,000 krone per year. In 1982, the mansion, as well as Kristianiagade 3 (consulate) and Bergensgade 11 (embassy school), were granted to the Soviets, on the basis of reciprocity, free of charge for the purpose of embassy requirements for a period of 70 years, until 31 December 2051.
The building and garage are heritage listed buildings. The both were placed on the register of the Heritage Agency of Denmark on 3 December 1991.

<doc id="204965" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=204965" title="Parthenogenesis">
Parthenogenesis

Parthenogenesis is a term in biology. It means "virgin birth". It is an asexual form of reproduction. Females lay eggs without fertilization by a male. Growth and development of embryos occurs with all genes inherited from the mother. 
It occurs in both plants and animals and is much less common than sexual reproduction. It even occurs in vertebrates:there are over 80 species of unisex reptiles, amphibians and fishes in nature for which males are no longer a part of the reproductive process.
Some plants and animals can reproduce either sexually or asexually. A good example are the aphids, (e.g. greenfly) which multiply parthenogenetically during the height of summer, but turn to sexual reproduction as the weather gets worse. At different times of the year, they can be viviparous (live birth) or oviparous (eggs). During spring and summer, aphids usually produce live young (nymphs) parthenogenetically. These female aphids may or may not have wings. Males only appear in any number at the close of the season. Females then give birth sexually during autumn, laying eggs. Therefore aphids are said to undergo 'cyclical parthenogenesis'. 
Another interesting fact is that there is a whole order of rotifers (the Bdelloid rotifers) where males have never been found. This is the largest taxonomic category to reproduce entirely by parthenogenesis. 
Other types of asexual reproduction exist. Clones are produced by many Hydrozoa (for example, many corals). Colonies grow, not by laying eggs, but by budding off new individuals. Very similar is reproduction by splitting, common in several phyla such as echinoderms and sponges. These methods are not called parthenogenesis, because they do not work by females laying eggs.

Kingsnake

Kingsnakes are colubrid snakes. They are members of the genus "Lampropeltis", which include milk snakes and four other species. There are many subspecies, and experts differ on their classification. These snakes are mostly found in the United States and Central America.
They use constriction to kill their prey. They prey on other snakes, including venomous snakes. They are immune to the venom. They also eat lizards, rodents, birds, and eggs.
Their colouration is an example of Batesian mimicry, because it is very similar to poisonous coral snakes living in the same areas. This gives the kingsnakes protection from the birds which prey on them.

<doc id="205108" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205108" title="Santa Monica Mountains">
Santa Monica Mountains

The Santa Monica Mountains are a group of mountains in southern California in the United States.
The range extends about 40 mi (64 km) east–west from the Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles to Point Mugu in Ventura County. The mountains form a line between the San Fernando Valley and the Los Angeles Basin, separating "the Valley" on the north and west-central Los Angeles on the south. The Santa Monica Mountains are parallel to Santa Susana Mountains, on the north side the San Fernando Valley. Beginning at the eastern end of the San Fernando Valley, the mountains are bordered to the north by the Los Angeles River. The river flows south after Elysian Park, defining the easternmost edge of the mountains. Mt. Washington, on the other side of the river, has almost the same native plants and weather.
Scientists who study rocks say that the northern Channel Islands are a westward extension of the Santa Monicas into the Pacific Ocean. The range was created by the Raymond Fault which made the rocks push up and sink down over time. This has made old volcano rock come to the surface. Malibu Creek cuts the mountain range in two.
The Santa Monica Mountains have dry, warm to humid summers and wet, mild to cool winters. In the summer, the weather is quite dry, which makes the range prone to wildfires. Snow is unusual in the Santa Monica Mountains, since they are not as high as the nearby San Gabriel Mountains. 
On January 17, 2007, an unusually cold storm brought snow in the Santa Monica Mountains. Malibu picked up three inches (eight centimeters) of snow – the first measurable snow in five decades (50 years). Snow was reported on Boney Peak, in the winter of 2005; and in March 2006, snow also fell on the summit of the mountain.
The mountains have more than 1,000 places where people lived a long time ago, including many places where Tongva and Chumash people lived. 
Cahuenga Pass, present-day site of U.S. Route 101, is the easiest pass through the range connecting the Los Angeles Basin to the San Fernando Valley. In the 1800s, two battles were fought there, and the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed nearby. In the heyday of Hollywood movie studios clustered on both sides of it. Sepulveda Pass is the main north–south pass to the west, connecting the Westside to Sherman Oaks via the San Diego Freeway (I-405). Farther west are Topanga Canyon Boulevard (SR 27), Malibu Canyon Road, and Kanan Dume Road. Mulholland Drive runs much of the length of the Santa Monica Mountains, from Cahuenga Pass to Woodland Hills while the Mulholland Highway runs from Woodland Hills to Sequit Point. The eastern end of the range, located in the City of Los Angeles, is more intensively developed than the western end of the range. The city of Malibu runs between the coast and the leading mountain ridge, from Topanga Canyon in the east to Leo Carrillo State Park in the west. The term Malibu Ozarks is sometimes used derogatorily (or ironically) for the unincorporated part of Malibu beyond the leading mountain ridge and lacking an ocean view; the term is often used synonymously with "818 Malibu" (referring to the less desirable San Fernando Valley telephone area code prefix).
Much of the mountains are located within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Preservation of lands within the region are managed in part by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. Over twenty individual state and municipal parks are in the Santa Monica Mountains, including: Topanga State Park, Leo Carrillo State Park, Malibu Creek State Park, Point Mugu State Park, Will Rogers State Historic Park, Point Dume State Beach, Griffith Park, Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park, Charmlee Wilderness Park, Runyon Canyon Park, and the Paramount Ranch.
Places along the north slope of the mountains include (from east to west):
Places along the south slope of the mountains include (from east to west):
The southwestern headwaters of the Los Angeles River are in the Santa Monica Mountains. The Los Angeles River also forms the northern boundary of the mountains from the easternmost part of the San Fernando Valley to Elysian Park, where the river turns south, thereby defining the easternmost part of the mountain range.
Griffith Park and finally Elysian Park are the eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains. Griffith Park is separated from the rest of the Santa Monica Mountains to the west by the Cahuenga Pass, over which the 101 Freeway passes from the San Fernando Valley into Hollywood. Elysian Park is the easternmost part of the mountains and is bordered by the Los Angeles River to the east.
The Santa Monica Mountains are in the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion and are covered by hundreds of local plant species, some of which are very rare, and others of which have become popular ornamentals. The range is host to an immense variety of wildlife, from mountain lions to the endangered steelhead. The mountain lion population within the Santa Monica Mountains (which includes the Simi Hills & Santa Susana Pass) is severely depleted with only seven known living adult individuals. The primary cause of the decline is due to a combination of traffic related mortality (three from the area were killed within a matter of months), anti-coagulants ingested from human-poisoned prey (two individuals within the Simi Hills) and attacks by other, more dominant mountain lions (an elder male, known as P1, killed both his son and his mate. This is thought to be due to a lack of space available.) Snakes are common but only occasionally seen – the Southern Pacific Rattlesnake (the only venomous species), Mountain Kingsnake, California Kingsnake, Gopher snake, and Garter snake.

Juan Crespi

Father Juan Crespí (March 1, 1721–January 1, 1782) was a Spanish priest who explored what is now the state of California. He entered the Franciscan order at the age of seventeen. He came to America in 1749, and joined Francisco Palóu and Junípero Serra in exploring. In 1767 he went to the Baja Peninsula and was placed in charge of the Misión La Purísima Concepción de Cadegomó. In 1769 he joined the Portola expedition of Gaspar de Portolà and traveled by land, while Father Serra went by boat and got there 8 days later to occupy Monterey; he was the first to write about Franciscan friars meeting with people who already lived there. Later, he went through the area known today as Ventura County, in January and Orange County on July 22 of that year. He was priest of the expedition to the North Pacific led by Juan José Pérez Hernández in 1774. His diaries, first published in H. E. Bolton's "Fray Juan Crespi" (1927, repr. 1971), and published in the original Spanish with facing page translations as "A Description of Distant Roads: Original Journals of the First Expedition into California, 1796-1770" (2001) provided valuable records of these expeditions. One chapel he built, at the Misión San Francisco del Valle de Tilaco in Landa, is reported as still standing.

Cha-cha-cha

Cha-cha-cha is the name of a Latin American music and dance, of Cuban origin. It is dance music introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrín in 1953. The rhythm was developed from a previous dance, the danzón, by a split fourth beat. The name is derived from the shuffling of the dancers' feet.
Many consider the "Orquesta Aragón" and the orchestra of José Fajardo to have been particularly influential in the development of the cha-cha-cha. Outside Cuba, the big bands of Tito Puente (in New York), and Pérez Prado (in Mexico City and California) introduced the Cha-cha-cha to a much wider audience.
Musically, the Cha-cha-cha was perhaps not a great innovation. However, it became hugely popular because people found it easy to dance to. Monsieur Pierre and his colleagues went to Cuba in the early 1950s to study it. They came back to London and codified the dance (sorted it out and wrote it down). It became a standard dance in Latin American ballroom dancing. It is one of the five Latin dances in international competitions governed by the World Dance Council. Today it is still popular as a dance, and is still danced in Cuba.

<doc id="205171" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205171" title="Parlour">
Parlour

Parlour (or parlor), comes from the French word "parloir", from "parler", which means "to speak". The parlour is a room in a house where people could meet. In Turkey it is called a kiosk. The Bible (Judges 3:20), talks about the "summer parlour", a small room built on the roof of the house, with open windows to catch the breeze. It has a door to the outside by which visitors can enter.
In parts of Great Britain and the United States, parlour is a common name for certain types of restaurants such as "ice cream parlour" and "pizza parlour". There are also "Beer parlors", wine parlors, or, in at least one case, a "spaghetti parlor." The word "parlour" has even been used to describe a coffee shop as the "coffee parlor." It can also mean a special service business, such as a tattoo parlour.
The "inner parlours" in 1 Chronicles 28:11 in the Bible were the small rooms or chambers which Solomon built all round two sides and one end of the Temple (1 Kings 6:5). Some people think the inner parlours may have been the porch and the holy place.
In medieval Christian usage, the parlour was one of two rooms in a monastery. The 'outer parlour' was the room where the monks or nuns could meet a visitor and do business with people from outside the monastery. It was generally in the west range of the buildings of the cloister, close to the main entrance. The 'inner parlour' was found off the cloister, next to the chapter house in the east range of the monastery. Most religious orders wanted silence in the cloister, which was the place where the monks studied. The inner parlour was a place where the monks could talk without disturbing the others in the cloister.
In modern use, the parlour is a formal "sitting room" in a large house or mansion. In the late 19th century, it was often a formal room used only on Sundays or special occasions, and closed during the week. The family kept their best furniture, works of art and other things on display in the parlour. The body of someone who died would be put on show in the parlour while funeral was being organized. During the 20th century, architects and decorators have changed the use of the room. In most homes the parlour has been replaced by the living room.

It was first widely used as an ivory replacement, in billiard balls for example. Celluloid catches fire very easily and also easily breaks down, and is no longer widely used. Its most common uses today are for making table tennis balls and guitar picks.

Kingdom Hearts

Kingdom Hearts is a series of console role-playing games made by Square Enix. Several characters, including the main character, Sora, and his friends Riku and Kairi, were created solely for the game, but many of his friends and enemies are existing characters from Disney movies and other Square Enix titles, mainly the "Final Fantasy" series. However, several characters from Square Enix's "The World Ends With You "also appear in "Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance."
As of 2011, there are six main games in the series, and five reissues. The main games, in order of release, are "Kingdom Hearts", ', "Kingdom Hearts II", "Kingdom Hearts coded", "Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days", "Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, and . The reissues, in order of release, are "Kingdom Hearts Final Mix", "Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix +", ', "", "Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix, Kingdom Hearts HD1.5 Remix, and Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix". Of the reissues, only "Re:Chain of Memories," "Re:Coded, "and both "Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix" and "2.5 Remix" have been released outside of Japan.
There is one game planned for future release at a currently unknown time, "Kingdom Hearts III", which will be for consoles.
"Kingdom Hearts" is the first game of the series, and was released in Japan on March 28, 2002 and in North America on September 17, 2002. It is made for the PlayStation 2. In it, the player controls Sora, a 14-year-old boy who lives on a small chain of islands called Destiny Islands. He and his best friends, Riku and Kairi, plan on leaving the islands and exploring, but their plans are interrupted when their world is attacked by the Heartless; monsters who steal people's hearts. During the attack, Sora becomes able to use a weapon called a Keyblade. Their world is destroyed, and Sora, Riku and Kairi end up on different worlds. Sora teams up with Disney characters Donald Duck and Goofy to find his lost friends, and they travel to worlds based on different Disney movies, including "Alice in Wonderland", "The Little Mermaid", and "The Nightmare Before Christmas".
Sora learns later that Riku has sided with Darkness and kidnapped Kairi. Riku is being controlled by a Heartless called Ansem, who wants to capture women and girls who are Princesses of Heart so he can open Kingdom Hearts, the heart of all worlds. Sora rescues Kairi and Riku and defeats Ansem. Kairi goes home to Destiny Islands, but Riku stays in Kingdom Hearts with King Mickey to defend it. Kingdom Hearts then disappears. Sora tells Kairi he will not come home until he finds Riku, and leaves with Donald and Goofy to start a new adventure.
"Kingdom Hearts Final Mix" is a reissue of the game that was released only in Japan on December 26, 2002. It has more features than "Kingdom Hearts", including a battle with the Unknown Man, who is the main enemy in "Kingdom Hearts II". It is also for the PlayStation 2.
"" is the second game in the series, and was released in Japan on November 11, 2004 and in North America on December 7, 2004. It was made for the Game Boy Advance. It starts immediately after the end of "Kingdom Hearts". Sora, Donald and Goofy go to a castle called Castle Oblivion where they visit recreations of the worlds they visited before. Each world is on a different floor, and as they move to higher floors, they lose more and more memories. Their lost memories are replaced by new ones. Sora eventually forgets Kairi, and she is replaced in his memory by a girl named Naminé. Sora also meets and fights members of a group called Organization XIII. The group built Castle Oblivion to erase Sora's memories and trick him into joining them. In the end, Naminé tells Sora she erased his memories, and gives him the choice to keep his new memories or have his old ones restored. If his memory is fixed, he will forget everything that happened in Castle Oblivion. He chooses to get his old memories back and tells Naminé he could never forget her. His story ends with him being put to sleep, because it will take Naminé one year to restore his memories.
After completing Sora's story, the player can play as Riku, who travels through Castle Oblivion's basement levels. Riku meets different members of Organization XIII than Sora did, and fights them. He also recalls what he did during "Kingdom Hearts" and struggles with Ansem's influence on him.
"" is a reissue of the game made for the PlayStation 2. It has added cutscenes and battles that were not in the Game Boy version of "Chain of Memories". It was released together with "Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix +" in Japan on March 29, 2007, and was released as a standalone title in North America on December 2, 2008.
"Kingdom Hearts II" starts one year after the end of "Chain of Memories". It was made for the PlayStation 2 and was released in Japan on December 22, 2005, in North America on March 28, 2006, and in Europe on September 29, 2006. The player starts the game controlling Roxas, a 15-year-old boy living in a town called Twilight Town. He is on summer vacation with his three best friends, Hayner, Pence, and Olette. As a week goes by, strange things begin to happen. A man named Axel, a member of Organization XIII who was in "Chain of Memories", shows up and is surprised and upset that Roxas does not remember him. They fight, and Roxas discovers that he can use a Keyblade. Roxas also meets Naminé and a man named DiZ who was in Riku's side of "Chain of Memories". Naminé tells Roxas she has been changing his memories so he can become "whole" again. Axel tells Roxas they used to be friends and that he must either take Roxas back to the Organization or destroy him. They battle, and Axel disappears. Roxas then finds Sora, and disappears himself.
After Roxas disappears, Sora wakes up and becomes the new player character. Donald and Goofy also wake up, and the three of them continue their mission to find Riku. As they search for him, they meet the rest of the members of Organization XIII and learn that they are beings called Nobodies. When a Heartless steals someone's heart, that person also becomes a Heartless, but if their heart is strong, their body becomes a Nobody. Nobodies have no emotions, but want to have hearts again. Xemnas, the leader of Organization XIII, is trying to summon Kingdom Hearts, which he claims will enable the Nobodies to get their hearts back. To summon Kingdom Hearts, Heartless must be killed with a Keyblade, which will release the hearts they hold and let them return to Kingdom Hearts. This is the reason the Organization wanted Sora to join them.
It is later revealed that Roxas is Sora's Nobody, and was a member of Organization XIII. Roxas was created when Sora briefly lost his heart in "Kingdom Hearts". Naminé is then revealed to be Kairi's Nobody, who was created when Kairi lost her heart at the beginning of "Kingdom Hearts". Xemnas is the Nobody of a man called Xehanort, who no longer exists. Ansem, the main enemy from the first game, was Xehanort's Heartless.
Near the end of the game, Sora, Kairi and Riku reunite and destroy Xemnas. With all members of Organization XIII destroyed and the worlds apparently safe, Sora, Riku and Kairi go home to Destiny Islands.
"Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix +" is a reissue of the game that was released only in Japan on March 29, 2007. It has more content than "Kingdom Hearts II", including new areas, new battles, and a new secret ending. It is also for the PlayStation 2.

Cuban music

Cuban music comes from the Caribbean island of Cuba. Cuba has developed a wide range of musical styles, which draw on its cultural origins in Europe and Africa. Cuba's music has been hugely popular and influential throughout the world. It has been perhaps the most popular form of world music since the introduction of recording technology.
The music of Cuba, including the instruments and the dances, is mostly of European (Spanish) and African origin. Most forms of the present day are fusions and mixtures of these two great sources. The original inhabitants of Cuba died out, and little remains of their traditions.
Large numbers of African slaves and European (mostly Spanish) immigrants came to Cuba and brought their own forms of music to the island. European dances and folk musics included the zapateo, the fandango, the paso doble, the minuet, the gavotte, the contradanza, and the waltz appeared among the urban whites.
The African slaves and their descendants made many percussion instruments and preserved rhythms they had known in their homeland. The most important instruments were the drums. Also important are the claves, two short hardwood batons, and the cajón, a wooden box, originally made from crates. Claves are still used often, and cajons ("cajones") were used widely during periods when the drum was banned.
The great instrumental contribution of the Spanish was their guitar, but even more important was the tradition of European musical notation and techniques of musical composition.
Fernando Ortíz described Cuba's musical innovations as arising from the interplay between African slaves settled on large sugar plantations and Spanish or Canary Islanders who grew tobacco on small farms.
The African beliefs and practices certainly influenced Cuba's music. Polyrhythmic percussion is an inherent part of African life & music, as melody is part of European music. Also typical is syncopation, which is heard in the "cinquillo", a basic rhythm of the habanera, the danzón, the Argentine tango and other dances.
Also, in African tradition, percussion is joined to song and dance, and to a particular social setting. It is not simply entertainment added to life, it "is" life. The result of the meeting of European and African cultures is that most Cuban popular music is creolized (fused). This creolization of Cuban life has been happening for a long time, and by the 20th century, elements of African belief, music and dance were well integrated into popular and folk forms.
Cuban music has been immensely influential in other countries, contributing not only to the development of jazz and salsa, but also to Argentinian tango, Ghanaian highlife, West African afrobeat, and Spanish Nuevo flamenco.
The Cathedrals of the old capital, Santiago de Cuba, and Havana, both employed fine musicians and choir-masters. They composed, taught and directed. This helped the development of all kinds of music. In the 19th century, Manuel Saumell (1818–1870), was the father of Cuban criole musical development. He helped transform the European contradanza by adding African rhythmical elements, and had a hand in the habanera, and the danzon, two typically Cuban dance forms.
During the middle years of the 19th century, a young American musician came to Havana: Louis Moreau Gottschalk (1829–1869), whose father was a Jewish businessman from London, and his mother a white creole of French Catholic background. Gottschalk was brought up mostly by his black grandmother and nurse Sally, both from Dominique. He was a piano prodigy who had listened to the music and seen the dancing in Congo Square, New Orleans from childhood. His period in Cuba lasted from 1853 to 1862, with visits to Puerto Rico and Martinique squeezed in. He composed many famous pieces which were genuinely Cuban, as they drew on traditions of both whites and blacks.
In February 1860 Gottschalk produced a huge work "La nuit des tropiques" in Havana. The work used about 250 musicians and a choir of 200 singers plus a drum group from Santiago de Cuba. He produced another huge concert the following year, with new material. These shows probably dwarfed anything seen in the island before or since, and no doubt were unforgettable for those who attended.
It was Ignacio Cervantes (1847–1905), who was probably most influenced by Gottschalk. Trained in Paris, he did much to assert a sense of Cuban musical nationalism in his compositions. Aaron Copland once referred to him as a "Cuban Chopin" because of his Chopinesque piano compositions. Cervantes' reputation today rests almost solely upon his famous forty-one "Danzas Cubanas", of which Carpentier said "occupy the place that the "Norwegian Dances" of Grieg or the "Slavic Dances" of Dvořák occupy in the musics of their respective countries".
From the 18th century to modern times, popular theatrical formats used, and gave rise to, music and dance. In addition to staging some European operas and operettas, Cuban composers gradually developed ideas which better suited their creole audience. Recorded music was the way for Cuban music to reach the world. The most recorded artist in Cuba up to 1925 was a singer at the "Alhambra", Adolfo Colombo. Records show he recorded about 350 numbers between 1906 and 1917, of which very few survive today.
The first theatre in Havana opened in 1776. The first Cuban-composed opera appeared in 1807. Musical theater was hugely important in the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century. Radio, which began in Cuba in 1922, helped the growth of popular music because it provided publicity and a new source of income for the artists.
Zarzuela is a small-scale light operetta format. Starting off with imported Spanish content, it developed into a running commentary on Cuba's social and political events and problems. A string of front-rank composers, such as Ernesto Lecuona, produced a series of hits for the theatres in Havana. Great stars like the "vedette" Rita Montaner, who could sing, play the piano, dance and act, were the Cuban equivalents of Mistinguett and Josephine Baker in Paris.
Cuban "Bufo" theatre is a form of comedy, ribald and satirical. It uses stock types that might be found anywhere in the country. Bufo had its origin around 1800–1815: Francisco Covarrubias 'the caricaturist' (1775–1850) was its creator. Gradually, the comic types threw off their European models and became more and more creolized and Cuban. Alongside, the music followed. Slang from slave barracks and poor barrios found its way into lyrics:
The guaracha is a genre of rapid tempo and with lyrics. It originated in Bufo comic theatre, and during the early 20th century was often played in the brothels of Havana. The lyrics were full of slang, and dwelt on events and people in the news.
The contradanza is an historically important dance. It arrived in Cuba in the late 18th century from Europe. The contradanza is a communal sequence dance, with the dance figures in a set pattern. The tempo and style of the music was bright and fairly fast. The earliest Cuban composition of a contradanza is "San Pascual bailon", published in 1803. The Cubans developed a number of creolized version, which is an early example of the influence of African tradition in the Caribbean. Most of the musicians were black or mulatto: even early in the 19th century there were many freed slaves and mixed race persons living in Cuban towns.
The contradanza supplanted the minuet as the most popular dance until from 1842 on, it gave way to the habanera, a quite different style.
This, the child of the contradanza, was also danced in lines or squares. It was also a brisk form of music and dance which could be in double or triple time. This type of dance was eventually replaced by the danzón, which was, like the habanera, much slower and more sedate.
The habanera developed out of the contradanza in the early 19th century. Its great novelty was that it was "sung", as well as played and danced. Its development was at least partly due to the influence of French-speaking immigrants. The Haitian revolution of 1791 led to many colonial French and their slaves fleeing to Oriente. The "cinquillo" is one important rhythmical pattern which made its first appearance at this time.
The dance style of the habanera is slower and more stately than the danza; by the 1840s there were habaneras written, sung and danced in Mexico, Venezuela, Puerto Rico and Spain. Since about 1900 the habanera has been a relic dance; but the music has a period charm, and there are some famous compositions, such as "Tu", versions of which have been recorded many times.
The waltz ("El vals") arrived in Cuba by 1814. It was the first dance in which couples were not linked by a communal sequence pattern. It was, and still is, danced in 3/4 time with the accent on the first beat. It was originally thought scandalous because couples faced each other, held each other in the 'closed' hold, and, so to speak, ignored the surrounding community. The waltz entered all countries in the Americas. The walz has another characteristic: it is a 'travelling' dance, with couples moving round the arena. In Latin dances, progressive movement of dancers is unusual, but does occur in some.
A typical dance of the Cuban "campesino" or "guajiro" A dance of pairs, involving tapping of the feet, mostly by the man. Illustrations exist from previous centuries, but the dance is now defunct.
In the 19th century here grew up in Santiago de Cuba a group of itinerant musicians, troubadors, who moved around earning their living by singing and playing the guitar. They were of great importance as composers, and their songs have been used in all types of Cuban music
Pepe Sánchez (1856–1918), was the father of the "trova" and the creator of the Cuban bolero. He had no formal training in music. With remarkable natural talent, he composed numbers in his head and never wrote them down. As a result, most of these numbers are now lost for ever, though some two dozen or so survive because friends and disciples transcribed them. He also created advertisement jingles before radio was born. He was the model and teacher for the great trovadores who followed him.
The first, and one of the longest-lived, was Sindo Garay (1867–1968). He was an outstanding composer of songs, and his best have been sung and recorded many times. Garay was also musically illiterate – in fact, he only taught himself the alphabet at 16 – but in his case not only were scores recorded by others, but there are recordings. He broadcast on radio, made recordings and survived into modern times. He used to say "Not many men have shaken hands with both José Martí and Fidel Castro!" 
Chicho Ibáñez (1875–1981) was even longer-lived than Garay. Ibáñez was the first trovador to specialize in the Cuban "son"; he also sung guaguancos and pieces from the abakuá (a black secret society).
Many of the early trovadores, such as Manuel Corona (who worked in a brothel area of Havana), composed and sung guarachas as a balance for the slower boleros.
This is a song and dance form quite different from its Spanish namesake. It originated in the last quarter of the 19th century with the founder of the traditional trova, Pepe Sánchez. He wrote the first bolero, "Tristezas", which is still sung today. The bolero has always been a staple part of the trova muusician's repertoire. The bolero proved to be exceptionally adaptable, and led to many variants. Typical was the introduction of syncopation. leading to the bolero-son, bolero-mambo and bolero-cha. The bolero-son became for several decades the most popular rhythm for dancing in Cuba, and it was this rhythm that the international dance community picked up and taught as the wrongly-named 'rumba'.
The European influence on Cuba's later musical development is represented by danzón, an elegant musical form that was once the most popular music in Cuba. It is a descendent of the creollized Cuban contradanza. The danzón marks the change which took place from the communal sequence dance style of the late eighteenth century to the couple dances of later times. The stimulus for this was the success of the once-scandalous walz, where couples danced facing each other and independently from other couples, not as part of a pre-set structure. The danzón was the first Cuban dance to adopt such methods, though there is a difference between the two dances. The walz is a progressive ballroom dance where couples move round the floor in an anti-clockwise direction; the danzón is a 'pocket-handkerchief' dance where a couple stays within a small area of the floor.
The danzón was exported to popular acclaim throughout Latin America, especially Mexico. It is now a relic, both in music and in dance, but its highly orchestrated descendents live on.
The "son", said Cristóbal Díaz, is the most important genre of Cuban music, and the least studied. It can fairly be said that "son" is to Cuba what the tango is to Argentina, or the samba to Brazil. In addition, it is perhaps the most flexible of all forms of Latin-American music. Its great strength is its fusion between European and African musical traditions. Its most characteristic instruments are the Cuban guitar known as the "tres", and the well-known double-headed "bongó"; these are present from the start to the present day. Also typical are the claves, the Spanish guitar, the double bass, and early on, the cornet or trumpet and finally the piano.
The "son" arose in Oriente, the eastern part of the island, merging the Spanish guitar and lyrical traditions with African percussion and rhythms. We now know that its history as a distinct form is relatively recent. There is no evidence that it goes back further than the end of the nineteenth century. It moved from Oriente to Havana in about 1909, carried by members of the "Permanente" (the Army), who were sent out of their areas of origin as a matter of policy. The first recordings were in 1918.
There are many types of "son". Odilio Urfé recognised these variants:
and one can certainly add
In addition, the son has again and again changed the older danzón to make it more syncopated and creole in style, starting in 1910 through the danzón-mambo and the cha-cha-cha to complex modern arrangements which are almost impossible to categorize.
The son varies widely today, with the defining characteristic a syncopated bass pulse that comes before the downbeat, giving son its distinctive rhythm; this is known as the "anticipated bass".
The history of jazz in Cuba was obscured for many years; however it has become clear that its history in Cuba is virtually as long as its history in the USA.
Much more is now known about early Cuban jazz bands, though a full assessment is plagued by the lack of recordings. Migrations and visits to and from the USA and the mutual exchange of recordings and sheet music kept musicians in the two countries in touch. In the first part of the 20th century there were close relations between musicians in Cuba and those in New Orleans. The orchestra leader in the famous Tropicana Club, Armando Romeu Jr, was a leading figure in the post-WWII development of Cuban jazz. The phenomenon of cubop, and jam sessions in Havana and New York, created genuine fusions which still influence musicians today.
World-wide interest in Cuban music was rekindled by a remarkable CD album entitled the "Buena Vista Social Club". An American guitarist, Ry Cooder, a British music producer, Nick Gold, and a Cuban musician, Juan Marcos Gonzáles, worked together on a new venture. They put together a group, mostly of older Cuban musicians, with the idea of recreating the Cuban music of the golden era of the 1950s. The first album, released in 1997, became a huge hit, selling over five million copies, and winning a Grammy in 1998. In 2003 it was listed by "Rolling Stone" magazine as #260 in their list of "The 500 Greatest Hits of All Time". A dozen more CDs have followed the first one, mostly issued by "Nonesuch Records" or "World Circuit".
A documentary movie, "Buena Vista Social Club", directed by Wim Wenders, was released in 1999. It grossed $23 million worldwide by 2007. A younger generation had discovered why Cuban music was so popular.

Dune (novel)

Dune is a fictional story set in a space empire far in the future. It is written by Frank Herbert. The book focuses on how politics, religion, technology and many other things interact.
In the world of the Dune series, computers are banned (they are not allowed anywhere). Some humans are taught how to think as fast as computers; they are known as 'Mentats'. The ruler of a planet is controlled by a House. The Houses must obey House Corrino, because the leader of House Corrino is also the Emperor.
"Dune" focuses on Paul Atreides, the 15-year-old heir to House Atreides. His family is forced by the Emperor who rules the Known Universe to leave the planet Caladan and to take control of the planet Arrakis. Arrakis is currently controlled by House Harkonnen, and is the only place that a spice called Melange is found. Melange is the most important thing in the universe. It lets you see the future and think much faster. If you take melange, you live much longer, sometimes even hundreds of years longer. It also lets you travel far distances at great speeds.
Arrakis is a planet that is almost covered in desert. This large desert is very dangerous because it does not have potable (drinkable) water, but mainly because giant worms live in the sand. There are many groups of native humans living there - they are called the Fremen. The Fremen have many rituals that keep water safe. This is important, or they would all die of dehydration (too little water to stay alive).
After his father is killed, Paul and his Mother escape and take refuge with the Fremen. They use their abilities to achieve power over the Fremen and eventually use them to attack the Harkonnen armies, who have taken back control of the planet.
In the books, there are the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, a religious group with only women as its members. This is because men do not have the right kind of mind to learn their ways correctly. They have much more control over their minds and bodies than normal people. Their goal is to protect the human race forever. They have a secret goal, which they want to achieve by their breeding program. It is to make a man that can be a Bene Gesserit. They call him the Kwisatz Haderach. They want to use the Kwisatz Haderach to control people more easily. Paui's mother, Lady Jessica, is a member of the sisterhood and trains her son to use mental and physical powers. 
Multiple films and tv series have been based on the "Dune" series, such as the 1984 film version directed by David Lynch.

Jim Crow laws

The Jim Crow laws were a number of laws requiring racial segregation in the United States. These laws were enforced in different states between 1876 and 1965. "Jim Crow" laws provided a systematic legal basis for segregating and discriminating against African Americans. The laws first appeared after the Civil War and the Reconstruction Era and were enforced through the mid-twentieth century. They were about segregating black and white people in all public buildings. "Jim Crow" was a racist term for a black person. Black people were usually treated worse than white people. This segregation was also done in the armed forces, schools, restaurants, on buses and in what jobs blacks got. In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled that such segregation in state-run schools was against the US Constitution. The decision is known as "Brown v. Board of Education". The other Jim Crow laws were abolished by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) fought against the Jim Crow laws. 
After the Civil War, the U.S. government tried to enforce the rights of ex-slaves in the South through a process called Reconstruction. However, in 1876, Reconstruction ended. By the 1890s, the Southern states' legislatures were all-white again. Southern Democrats, who did not support civil rights for blacks, completely ruled the South. This gave them a lot of power in the United States Congress. For example, Southern Democrats were able to make sure that laws against lynching did not pass.
Starting in 1890, Southern Democrats began to pass state laws that took away the rights African Americans had gained. These racist laws became known as Jim Crow laws. For example, they included:
In 1896, the United States Supreme Court ruled in a case called "Plessy v. Ferguson" that these laws were legal. They said that having things be "separate but equal" was fine. In the South, everything was separate. However, places like black schools and libraries got much less money and were not as good as places for whites. Things were separate, but not equal.

Typhus

Typhus is the name for a number of diseases, caused by bacteria called Rickettsiae. These bacteria are parasites that cannot survive outside their host organism. Depending on the species the host organisms are, fleas (on rats), harvest mites (on several rodents and humans), or lice (on humans). When the term is commonly used, it usually means "endemic typhus", which is spread by lice. The name "typhus" comes from Greek, where it means "smoky" or "hazy". This was the word used to describe the state of mind the patients are in. 
Typhus can be treated with antibiotics.

Federico Peña

Federico Fabian Peña (born March 15, 1947) was United States Secretary of Transportation from 1993 to 1997 and United States Secretary of Energy from 1997 to 1998, during the presidency of Bill Clinton.
Born in Laredo, Texas, Peña earned a B.A. (1969) and a J.D. (1972) from the University of Texas at Austin and The University of Texas School of Law. Moving to Colorado, where he became an attorney, Peña was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1979, where he became the Minority Leader. In 1983, Peña became the first Hispanic Mayor of Denver, and he was re-elected in 1987.
Peña advised Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton on transportation issues during Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign, and Clinton chose Peña to head the United States Department of Transportation. Although he was going to leave Clinton's cabinet after Clinton's first term, Peña also served as Secretary of Energy for one year, from 1997 to 1998. In 1995 the Justice Department began a preliminary investigation into a California transit agency's awarding of a pension management contract to Peña's former investment management firm. However, Peña had cut all connections to his former company both before the contract and before becoming Transportation Secretary. On March 17, 1995 Janet Reno ended the investigation.
When Peña left the Clinton administration, he returned to Denver and joined investment firm Vestar Capital Partners in August 1998, as Senior Advisor. On January 18, 2000, Vestar announced that Peña had become one of the firm's Managing Directors.
Peña is the father of three children: Nelia, Cristina, and Ryan Peña. The divorce of Federico Peña and his first wife, Ellen Hart Peña, became final on September 10, 2001. Federico Peña married Cindy Velasquez on September 2, 2006. Cindy Velasquez is a former broadcast executive for Channel 7, KMGH-TV, and Channel 9, KUSA-TV, in Denver, Colorado.
On September 7, 2007, Peña announced that he would support Sen. Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election, and also serve as Obama's National Campaign Co-chair. The move was important in that Peña did not support Sen. Hillary Clinton, the wife of the president under whom he served. On November 5, 2008, he was named to the advisory board of the Obama-Biden Transition Project.
Peña Boulevard, a freeway in Denver connecting Denver International Airport to Interstate 70, is named for him. As mayor of Denver, Peña led the effort to build the airport.

Cynognathus

Cynognathus was a cynodont (a mammal-like reptile, not a dinosaur) that was the size of a wolf. This therapsid lived on open plains during the early to middle Triassic period, roughly 230-245 million years ago. It was probably warm-blooded and may have given birth to live young. Fossils have been found in South Africa and Argentina.

Natural units

Natural units are ways of measuring things that depend on some basic characteristics of nature that do not change. Which of these basic quantities to choose can depend on the physics problems being investigated, and sometimes choosing one thing as a natural unit means that the size of something else does not become used as a natural unit in that system.
The old system of English measurements such as the pound are based on convenient objects in the natural world. The "grain" is the smallest of these objects, and originally it meant the weight of a grain of wheat or barley. Each individual grain might be slightly larger or smaller than the next, but the more grains were added together to make a larger measure, the more these little differences would even out. Even so, these measures were not entirely precise and did not relate to other measures such as the inch or the foot.
In order to make calculations simpler and units more precise, it turned out that the mass of an electron or the mass of a proton were more useful standards to use for weight. All electrons are believed to have the same mass, and all protons are believed to have their own standard mass. But there is no simple mathematical relationship between the two masses.
The speed of light, c, is a constant. So c is a very natural choice to use as a standard for measuring velocity.
One choice for a standard of length is the Bohr radius. The simplest atom, hydrogen, only has one electron, and its smallest possible orbit, that with the lowest energy, is at a distance from the nucleus called the Bohr radius.
With a standard for measuring distances and a standard for velocity, it would be possible to derive one standard unit of time. In practice, there are several ways of defining units of time. One of the most widely known ways to measure time by natural cycles is by using atomic clocks.

Alexis Herman

Alexis Margaret Herman (born July 16, 1947 in Mobile, Alabama) was the 23rd U.S. Secretary of Labor, serving under President Bill Clinton. Before that, she was Assistant to the President and Director of the White House Office of Public Liaison.
The daughter of politician Alex Herman and schoolteacher Gloria Caponis, Alexis grew up a Catholic home in Mobile and earned her high school diploma in 1965 from the Heart of Mary High School. For a short time, she went to Edgewood College in Madison, Wisconsin, and Spring Hill College in Mobile, but then switched to Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans, where she became a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology in 1969.
After college, Herman worked for Catholic Charities and other agencies advocating minority women employment. Jimmy Carter met Herman while campaigning in Atlanta, Georgia, and after becoming President in 1977, picked her to be Director of the Labor Department's Women's Bureau. At age 29, she was the youngest person to ever serve in that position.
In 1981, Herman founded her own consulting firm - A.M. Herman & Associates. She served as president of the company while remaining active in Democratic politics. During her time as chief of staff and later vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, she was in charge of organizing the 1992 Democratic National Convention.
After Bill Clinton's win in the 1992 Presidential election, Herman became deputy director of the Presidential Transition Office. She was later picked to head the White House Office of Public Liaison, where she was responsible for the administration's relations with interest groups. 
During Clinton's second term, Herman was named Secretary of Labor, the first African American to be picked for that position and the fifth woman to be picked. Congressional Republicans and labor unions initially opposed giving her the job. But she earned praise from her peers for her handling of the 1997 UPS workers strike.

She was the 5th cabinet officer be investigated by independent counsel. Bill Clinton testified on her side. In 2000 the investigation ended with no indictment. 
During the 2000 Florida election recount, Herman was part of team planning a transition to a Gore Administration, and she was mentioned as a likely pick for White House Chief of Staff. She was replaced as Secretary of Labor in the George W. Bush administration by Elaine Chao.
Herman now serves as the co-chairperson (with James Roosevelt, Jr.) of the Democratic National Committee's Rules and Bylaws Committee.
Herman also serves on the boards of several big companies, including Coca Cola Corporation's Human Resources Task Force, Toyota's Diversity Advisory Board, Cummins, Metro Goldwyn Mayer, and Prudential and is the chairman and CEO of New Ventures, Inc.

Conjugate variables

Conjugate variables are special pairs of variables (e.g., x, y, z) that do not commute, If two variables, let us call them m and n, commute, then mn = nm. If two variables, let us call them p and q, do not commute, then pq ≠ qp. 
One of the best known pairs of conjugate variables was found in 1925 by Werner Heisenberg and his co-workers. Heisenberg changed equations from classical physics to describe and predict quantum events. That way he produced an equation that could be used to figure out the product of momentum (mass × velocity) and position (x, y, z, t): 
In the following equations, n, n-a, n-b, etc. name energy levels of an electron in a hydrogen atom. So in the diagram that shows an electron falling from a higher to a lower orbit, a pair of values such as n and n-a would belong to the beginning orbit and the ending orbit.
The first kind of equation could be used to calculate the product of momentum and position:
The same kind of equation could be used to calculate the product of position and momentum:
Heisenberg understood right away that these two results were going to be different, and it bothered him. He was very tired after making his work, which he wrote up as a paper for . So after he gave the paper to Max Born for editing and then to send off to the publisher, Heisenberg went on vacation. Born realized that these strange equations were blueprints for making a matrix for momentum and a matrix for position and then multiplying the two. He also saw that not only would multiplying the matrix p by the matrix q give a different answer matrix than multiplying the matrix q by the matrix p, but that the difference between the two could be computed from the other equations that were involved in Heisenberg's paper, and "Immediately there stood before me the strange :
[The symbol Q is the matrix for position, P is the matrix for momentum, i stands for the square root of negative one (√-1), and h is Planck's constant.]
This equation is an important hint to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

Theory

A theory is a group of linked ideas intended to explain something. A theory provides a framework for explaining observations. The explanations are based on assumptions. From the assumptions follows a number of possible hypotheses. They can be tested to provide support for, or challenge, the theory.
The word 'theory' has several meanings:
These meanings can "shade into each other". Another source offers: 
A theory in science (in contrast to a theory in layman's terms) is "a logical, systematic set of principles or explanation that has been verified—has stood up against attempts to prove it false". For example, Darwin's theory of Evolution is a system of ideas that points to humans and apes having evolved from a common ancestor. This conclusion is based on evidence that supports it.
One basic thing needed by a theory is not to defeat itself. If someone argued that every action a human being takes in life is predetermined before that person is even born, and also argued that a human being will determine his or her future according to the acts that he or she freely wills, there is a contradiction. 
This idea is called "the principle of non-contradiction", not saying the opposite of what you just said. If we consider any statement, A (perhaps A stands for "The Apple has a worm in it."), then A and the contradiction of A is always false. (In logical symbolism, the single statement "A ∧ ¬A" has a truth value of 0 or false.)
A theory that can produce a statement that is not true, a theory that can predict something that does not in fact happen, or that predicts that something will happen but it does not happen, is not a correct theory. This idea has a big hole to fall into. Scientists can look at experiment after experiment, and they may always find that what theory says is true. Years may pass, and then somebody looks at one more experiment. That experiment shows that the theory is false, and every time they do that experiment it shows that the first time was not some kind of accident. The philosopher Karl Popper gave the example of people in Europe before 1492 who wanted to give scientific descriptions of birds. One bird they worked on was the swan. Somebody proposed the idea, "All swans are white." All of the swans that were checked in their century were white. When Europeans first sailed to Australia, the first swan that they saw was black. Suddenly the old scientific description of swans had to be changed.
So it is never possible to prove conclusively that some theory is correct. A "black swan" may come with the next experiment. It is possible to prove some theories are incorrect. Science makes progress by using one theory until it fails, trying to understand why that theory failed, and then making a better theory. Some theories are very well confirmed, that means that they have been tried over and over again and have never yet failed. When a theory is well confirmed people trust its predictions.
It is possible to prove conclusively that some theory is incorrect. Proving a theory is incorrect makes it possible to find a better theory and thus to make progress.

Fingering (sexual act)

Fingering is the act of touching of the clitoris, vagina, vulva or anus for the purpose of sexual arousal and stimulation with the fingers. It is like the handjob (manual stimulation of the penis). It is a common form of foreplay or mutual masturbation. To "finger oneself" is to masturbate in this way.
Digital penetration is penetration (for example sexual penetration), with one or more fingers.
Vaginal fingering can end in orgasm. It also may or may not include the entire sexual encounter. It may be part of foreplay or part of a start to other sexual activities. These activities can provide sexual pleasure to a partner when penetrative intercourse is not possible or desirable for whatever reason.
Fingering of the butt and rectum is commonly enjoyed in preparation for further anal sex. Anal fingering can arouse a person, allowing them to relax their anus and prepare them for the insertion of a penis or a dildo.
The practice is generally considered safe sex as long as the hands are protected with a latex gloves.

Dodger Stadium was constructed from 1959 to 1962 at a cost of $23 million dollars. A neighborhood called Chavez Ravine had to be torn down to build the stadium. The Los Angeles Angels rented from the Dodgers from 1962 through 1965, before moving to Anaheim Stadium. The Angels called the ballpark Chavez Ravine Stadium.
Over five million people have seen a game in Dodger Stadium. The Dodgers have won four World Series while playing in the stadium, in 1963, 1965, 1981 and 1988.
There was talk of tearing down the stadium to build a football stadium, but that did not happen.

Similar to the ER is the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) found only in muscle cells. The SR stores and pumps calcium ions. The SR contains large stores of calcium, which it releases when the muscle cell is stimulated. Another type of cytoplasmic network is the plate-like Golgi apparatus.
The lacey membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum were first seen in 1945 by scientists using an electron microscope.

Morant Bay rebellion

The Morant Bay rebellion began on October 11, 1865, when Paul Bogle led 200 to 300 black men and women into the town of Morant Bay, parish of St. Thomas in the East, Jamaica. The rebellion and its aftermath were a major turning point in Jamaica's history, and also generated a significant political debate in Britain. Today, the rebellion remains controversial, and is frequently mentioned by specialists in black and in colonial studies.
Slavery ended in Jamaica on August 1, 1834, with the passing of the British Emancipation Act, which led to emancipation on 1 August 1838 – the date on which former slaves became free to choose their employment and employer.

1138 Aleppo earthquake

The 1138 Aleppo earthquake happened near the town of Aleppo in northern Syria on 11 October 1138. The United States Geological Survey lists it as the third deadliest earthquake in history with 230,000 people killed. However, the number of dead comes from a combination of this earthquake with earthquakes in November 1137 on the Jazira plain and 30 September 1139 in Ganja, Azerbaijan in historical records. Ibn Taghribirdi first wrote about the large number of dead in the fifteenth century.

Latino moderne

Latino Moderne (LM) is a language that was made by David Th. Stark in the 1980s and first published on the internet in 1996. It is a revision of the grammar of the IALA's language Interlingua, using the IALA's words with little change. Applying the same principles that were used in developing the international vocabulary for Interlingua to developing a grammar, L.M. restores personal endings on its verbs and has gender and number agreement between its nouns and their adjectives and articles. The language also has an more clearly developed system for showing case distinctions in its pronouns. This, in effect, frees L.M. from a dependence on word order as is found in Interlingua. The changes in L.M. actually are very simple and easy to learn, providing a much more poetic and free use of it for international communication. Most of the changes that L.M. makes to the IALA language are actually suggestions that were set forth by the original deverlopers of the IALA project. Properly speaking, L.M. should be viewed as a continuation to the IALA project, not as something in competition with it. 
It is hoped that the spread and use of Latino Moderne may assist in solving some of the communication problems that exist in the European Union and throughout the modern world. In this respect it shares the same goals as Interlingua, Esperanto, etc.. The developer of the language hopes that L.M. will be received and used as a suggested model language to help promote better international communication and friendship among nations.
NO community is presently established for the Latino Moderne (L.M.) project. Its developer, David Th. Stark, welcomes any activity in this area by other interested parties. "The language, Latino Moderne, belongs to all those who desire to use it." 
LM21
Patre nostre, 
Qui es in celo,
Sia Sanctificate tue nomine!
Que adveni tue regno!
Sia facite tue voluntate, como in celo, assi sur la terra!
Le pan nostre necesse da nobis hodie,
E pardona nobis las debitas nostras,
Como anque nos pardonamus les debitores nostres.
E ne induce nes in a le tentation,
Ma libera nes ab le mal,
Proque tues son le regno e la potentia e la gloria 
Por tute las epochas. Amen.
And Modern Latin is also a simplified Interlingua, which same text as above is :
Nostre Patre qui es in le cielos, Que tu nome sia sanctificate ! Que tu reino veni ! Que tu voluntat sia facte sure terra como in cielo ! Dona nois este jorno nostre pan quotidian, E perdona nois nostre ofensas como nos perdona a nostre ofensores. E non somete nois al tentation, ma libera nois del mal, Porque son de te le reino, le pocentia e le gloria pro le sieclos de sieclos. Amen.

<doc id="205783" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205783" title="BookCrossing">
BookCrossing

BookCrossing (also: BC, BCing or BXing) is defined as "the practice of leaving a book in a public place to be picked up and read by others, who then do likewise." The term comes from bookcrossing.com, a free online book club which began in order to further the practice, with the goal to "make the whole world a library."
The 'crossing' or exchanging of books may take many different forms, including wild releasing books in public, direct swaps with other members of the website, or "book rings" in which books travel in a set order to people who want to read that book. The community aspect of BookCrossing.com has grown in ways that were not expected at the start, in the form of blog or forum discussions, mailing lists and yearly conventions all over the world.
Ron Hornbaker came up the idea for what is now known as BookCrossing in March 2001. About four weeks later, on April 17, he started the website, which has grown all over the world. By April 2003 the website had over 113,000 members, and in 2004 the "Concise Oxford Dictionary" included the word "bookcrossing". In the same year, BookCrossing was featured as a part of a storyline in the Australian soap opera "Neighbours". As of 30 September 2009, Bookcrossing.com had over 814,000 members, with over 5,800,000 registered books.
In July 2007 Singapore became the first official BookCrossing country in the world. 2,000 locations within the country were designated as 'hotspots', similar to Official BookCrossing Zones. In 2008, BookCrossing was introduced to Abu Dhabi as part of a joint venture with the Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture and Heritage.
In May 2005 BookCrossing.com won two People's Voice awards in the Webby Awards for best community website and best social/networking website. BookCrossing was also featured in a BBC Radio project broadcast as 84 Book Crossing Road, which involved releasing 84 copies of Helene Hanff's book "84 Charing Cross Road" around the world. The show was produced by Tim Heffer and Alan Hall of Falling Tree Productions, and was nominated for a Sony Radio Academy Award in 2006.
Anyone who wishes to "release" books, whether leaving it in a public place or passing it on to a friend, must register on the BookCrossing.com website, although there is the option to remain hidden when "catching" the find of a book. BookCrossing.com users can 'go hunting', where a member will go to the website to view a list of books that have just been "released", then go to the place it was left to "catch" it. Books may also be left at Official BookCrossing Zones" (OBCZs), which are located in certain coffee shops, cafes, restaurants and other public places. The purpose of these places is to get members in the area to leave books to share with the public. This also promotes BookCrossing and creates more members.

Bukit Timah

Bukit Timah is an area in Singapore and a hill in that area. Bukit Timah Hill stands at an altitude of and is the highest point in the city-state of Singapore. Bukit Timah is near the centre of Singapore island. Bukit Timah is 10 kilometres (6 miles) from Singapore's business district.
Bukit Timah, which means "tin-bearing hill" in Malay, was on the 1828 map by Frankin and Philip Jackson as "Bukit Timah". The hill was on the map as the eastern source of the Kranji River. 
In December 1843, a road was built up to the hill. The hill was an "excellent sanatorium", as the air was "cooler and fresher than the plain, producing an agreeable exhilaration of spirits".
For some, it is synonymous with the Singapore Turf Club, where members and paying visitors flock on race days. This course is closed to the public, unlike the former course (now Farrer Park) where the general public enjoyed watching the king's sport for free.
The 25-km long Bukit Timah Road, the longest road in Singapore, running north and south of the island, takes its name from this hill. The road to Kranji was completed in 1845. Apparently, the area was so infested with tigers that it constituted a serious threat to human life. In 1860, nearly 200 people were reported to have been killed by tigers in and about the gambier and pepper plantations. The first ride on horseback across the island was along Bukit Timah Road in 1840; it took four days and was made by Mr Thomson and Dr Little.
Bukit Timah Road is known as "tek kha kang a kinn" in Hokkien, which means "the side of the stream in the "tek kha" (or Selegie Road) district". This only refers to the lower end of the Bukit Timah Road. The Wayang Satu and Bukit Timah village parts are differently called. The Hokkiens also refer to Bukit Timah as "be chia lo bue", meaning "end of the horse carriage road".
During World War II, the British Army lost Bukit Timah to the Japanese on February 11th, they knew they had little chance of winning the war as most of their food and supplies were stored there. On 15 February 1942, the head of the Allied forces, Lieutenant General A.E. Percival surrendered to Lieutenant General Tomoyuki Yamashita at the Ford Factory in Bukit Timah.
During the Japanese Occupation, the Japanese troops built a Syonan-to Shinto shrine (Syonan-to was the Occupation name for Singapore), similar to the National Shinto in Japan but of a smaller size, at Bukit Timah Hill. Two war memorials dedicated to the Japanese war dead and surprisingly, to the deceased British troops who died defending Singapore, were built at the site. Students, Japanese commanders, British POWs' representatives would gather there regularly to commemorate the dead during the Occupation.
It was only shortly before the Japanese surrender, the Japanese forces hastily destroyed the Shinto Shrine, on fears that returning British forces will demolish it in an bad manner. The present site where the Shinto Shrine existed, lied at a grey area between the Nature Reserve and Singapore Armed Forces restricted area. Several historians have been down at the site, and an episode from then Television Corporation of Singapore (TCS) history documentary show, "Hey Singapore", was on the mysterious Shinto Shrine. Since then, the Singapore Government has erected the place as "Historical Site". No plans have been indicated to restore the site, on speculations of angry responses from the People Republic of China (PRC) and abroad. 
The Japanese war dead were brought back to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, while the remains of the British troops were instituted at the British Commonwealth's Kranji War Memorial in Singapore. Nothing of the Syonan-to Shinto shrine remains, except for the Holy Cleansing Pond and several Japanese stone pavements left at the site.
After the Japanese Occupation, the farms and plantations in Bukit Timah gave way to industrial buildings and high-rise flats. In the 1960s and 1970s, Bukit Timah was a major industrial center. Today, these have been replaced with luxury bungalows, terraces and condominiums, making Bukit Timah Singapore's premier residential district.
The Bukit Timah area is a particularly prominent location with a high land value. The area of Bukit Timah has an extensive flora and forest compared to the parts of Singapore, and contains Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, which is partially responsible for its high land value. The nature reserve was established in 1883.
The Bukit Timah Race Course, a Thoroughbred horse racing facility, was opened in 1933 and operated until 1999.
The nearby area houses many bungalows, traditionally expensive in land-scarce Singapore, as well as high rise condominiums. Many expatriates and well heeled Singaporeans tend to stay in this region. The rise in land prices has led to development of new condominiums. For example, the Copthorne Orchid Hotel in Dunearn Road is being redeveloped into condominiums for sale.
This region was later extended and Upper Bukit Timah (District 21) was formed. The Keretapi Tanah Melayu from Malaysia has a passing loop station here along its rail network from Johor Bahru to Tanjong Pagar.

Tenure

Tenure is normally used for jobs, usually academic high-ranking jobs like professors. It is to protect professors who are teaching something that their employer, the university, might not agree with. Tenure means that these people cannot be fired without a very good reason- the job is for life. The reason for tenure is to help professors be bold about what they teach and research, so that new ideas will be developed. Or a teacher can also have a tenure. It depends how long their term has to be.
Sometimes judges also get tenure. This is so that they can make decisions based on the evidence, even if this means saying that the government, which is their employer, is wrong.

Vikings

The Vikings were peoples from Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, and Sweden) from about 700 AD to about 1100. This period is called the Viking Age. Vikings travelled great distances in their longships, as traders, settlers and warriors. Many of the Vikings were tall and had red or blonde hair and beards. Villages on or near any coast in early medieval Europe lived in great fear of Viking attacks. Some of the countries most affected by Viking raids were Britain, Germany, France, Spain and Italy. The word viking seems to have two uses. The word "vikingr", taken from rune stones, meaning a man who has gone with other men on a military journey. "Viking" is a word for the journey itself. The word did not seem to include those who went on peaceful trading journeys.
The people of the far north, later called Vikings, were first noticed by the Romans around the year 100 BC. This is when the Cimbri and the Teutons moved into southern Gaul. The Romans believed these war-like tribes came from Jutland. But the Romans suspected they were only a part of a greater threat located further north. The Roman historians Jordanes described the destructive Ostrogoths and Visigoths as having come from Gotland. The northern menace survived the fall of the Western Roman Empire. 
The Frankish Empire that succeeded them in Gaul became more and more aware of the northern threat. As the later Carolingian Empire expanded into northern Germany they came into contact with the Danish people. This is when the Vikings first entered into written history. The first recorded raid in the west was at Lindisfarne in 793. Why the Vikings suddenly began raiding is not completely clear. But a popular theory is the populations had grown to the point there was not enough food to feed everyone. The earliest raiders did not seem to want to move out of Scandinavia. They turned to looting, then returning home. This seems to indicate there was space enough for everyone. Because they found raiding so easy, it became more and more popular among the Vikings.
Three different groups of Vikings can be identified. They took three different, sometimes overlapping, routes.
Europeans were scared of the Vikings because of their strong weapons, swift attacks, and cruel fighting tactics. They were known for their bad treatment of women, children and monks in the places where they fought. When the Vikings came to England, the English kings paid them to leave the country, but the Vikings took their money and sometimes fought them anyway. These payments were called Danegeld. From the 9th century to 1066, when the French Duke of Normandy, who became King William I of England, conquered it, Danish and Norwegian Vikings ruled large parts of England.
Because of their longships, which could float in 4 feet (1.3m) of water, the Vikings were able to make their way up rivers and land deep inside a country. For example they sailed up the River Shannon in Ireland and built a harbour 60 miles (100 km) from the coast.
There was a difference in who led Viking raids. In the 9th century Viking Age raids were led by men who may have been exiles in their own countries. The later Viking raids in the late 10th century and early 11th century and were led by Kings. Some of the early leaders tried to become kings with the riches they plundered from Europe and Russia. Some were successful but most were not.
The Vikings were called Rus' by the peoples east of the Baltic Sea. The Vikings who settled in Kiev and formed the first Russian state. The Vikings (Rus') who served the Byzantine Emperors were called Varangians. They became the personal bodyguards to the Emperor and were called the Varangian Guard.
The Vikings traveled through Russia, the Mediterranean Sea, southern Europe, northern Africa and south-western Asia. Some Vikings sailed across the Atlantic Ocean via Iceland and Greenland and may have explored places in North America. The ruins of a Viking settlement have been found at L'Anse-aux-Meadows, Newfoundland. Archaeologists used radiocarbon dating to find out how old the settlement was. Their tests gave them a range of dates from about AD 700 to about AD 1000.
Some English words, and many place names, came from the Scandinavian and Viking language (Norse). For example, the words "skirt" and "shirt" came from the word "skyrta", meaning a tunic. As English changed, the semantics altered to give us the separate words 'skirt' and 'shirt' we know today. "Skin" came from the Norse word "skinn" (which meant to strip the meat off something). Some place-names in the areas the Vikings conquered are still in use. For example in Yorkshire places ending with "-thwaite" meant a "clearing", and "dale" which meant a "valley". The word "thorpe" meant "new village", such as Scunthorpe.
The Anglo-Saxons called the Vikings pagans. They worshiped a great many gods. Viking gods belonged to two groups of gods in Norse mythology. They either belonged to the Aesir or the Vanir. The Aesir were gods of war. Aesir means "gods". They were the rulers of Asgard. Odin was the leader of the Aesir. He and the gods under him ruled mortal men. The vanir were wise gods skilled in magical arts. they live in Vanaheim, although nobody knows where it is. The Vanir can also predict the future. There was a war between the Aesir and the Vanir. When it ended the god Njord and his children Freya and Freyr came to live in Asgard.
The pagan Vikings were exposed to Christianity from the beginning of the Viking Age. They were surrounded by Christian countries. Early Christian missionaries were either enslaved or put to death. The Vikings came into contact with Christianity when they raided other areas around them. Viking raids produced many Christian slaves who were brought back to Scandinavia. They called Christians "Cross-men" because of the cross in their worship. In response many Vikings adopted Thors hammer as their religious symbol. When Vikings settled in Christian areas they converted to Christianity. There are still Headstones in England with both a cross and a hammer. Perhaps they thought it was better to be safe than sorry. That, or the more gods the better. As some Vikings turned from raiding to trading they found a nominal (in name only) profession of Christianity to be helpful. Scandinavia, their homeland, was slower to change to the Christian religion. But by the mid-11th century most of Norway and Denmark had converted. Sweden was converted by the mid-12th century. Overall Scandinavia and the peoples of the Baltic Sea were the last to accept Christianity. 
The Viking's religion affected Christianity as well. The pagan celebration of Yuletide became Christmas along with the custom of the Christmas tree. Priests blessing the fields took the place of pagan fertility rites of spring held to make sure there was a good harvest. Norse kept their "farm gods" well after Christianity just to make sure they were protected. Santa Claus owes much of his legend to the Norse god Odin. With his snow-white beard he traveled the midwinter sky on his eight-footed steed Sleipnir visiting his people with gifts. He became Father Christmas. Blended with the Christian Saint Nicholas he (they) became Santa Claus.

Piracy

Piracy is a crime that is committed on ships which are at sea. Pirate is the name given to those people. They usually have small and fast boats. They use these boats to attack other ships, which are usually large cargo ships. 
For as long as ships have sailed the sea, there have been pirates. From the Greeks, to the Romans, to the Middle Ages, to the British Empire, there have always been pirates. Sometimes fighting pirates has been one of the most important jobs of a navy.
A lot of piracy still happens nowadays in the Gulf of Aden, mostly by Somali pirates. Modern-day pirates usually climb onto ships to get money. In the process, they may kill the crew, or hold them for ransom. In a very few cases, they may also take over the ship and sell its cargo.
The cargo ships that travel the oceans are huge. They usually have very few crew members working on them. Since the ships are so big, they often carry a lot of money in the ship's safe. This money is used to pay the crew, and to pay for the taxes to stay at a port, or to pass through a channel.

Digital media

Digital media (compared to analog media) is electronic media that works on digital codes. Today, computing is based on the binary numeral system, so the "digital" refers to the use of "0" and "1" to show data. Computers are machines that use binary digital data as information. Digital media ("Formats for presenting information" according to media) like digital audio, digital video and other digital "content" can be created, referred to and distributed by digital information processing machines. Digital media is a big change from (analog) media.
The transformation of an Analog signal to Digital information by an analog-to-digital converter is called sampling. According to information theory, sampling is a reduction of information. Most digital media are based on turning analog data into digital data and vice-versa (see digital recording, digital video, television versus digital television).
Compared to analog data, digital data is easier to control, and can be made into many copies without losing any quality. Mathematical operations can be made into digital information regardless of its meaning (you can add "2" to the data "65" and view the result either as the hexadecimal number "43" or the letter "C"). Thus, it is possible to use the same compression operation onto a text file or an image file or a sound file.

Crystal Cave, Bermuda

Crystal Cave is the most famous of Bermuda's many underground caverns. It is in Hamilton Parish, close to Castle Harbor. A favorite of tourists since since 1907, it was found in 1905 by Carl Gibbons and Edgar Hollis. The two boys were looking for their lost cricket ball which fell into a hole in the ground. Soon after, the Wilkinson family (the owners of the property since 1884) learned of the discovery. Mr. Percy Wilkinson lowered his 14-year-old son Bernard into it with a bicycle lamp on 140 feet of rope tied to a tree to explore the cave.
The area around Harrington Sound (which is to the south of Crystal Cave) is made of and has many underground waterways, through which the waters of the sound empty into the Atlantic. Crystal Cave is one of these, and - as its name suggests - has many stalactites, stalagmites, and deep crystal-clear pools.
Next to Crystal Cave is Fantasy Cave with Fantasy being deeper (88 steps down). Fantasy Cave was reopened in the summer of 2001 with all the walking paths having been rebuilt and additional lighting added. It was found and opened about the same time as Crystal Cave. It had been closed by the owners in the 1940s.
The two caves on 8 Crystal Caves Rd. at Wilkinson Ave. can be reached by bus, taxi and other private forms of transportation. Outside the two caves is a sub-tropical garden lined with palm trees where one will find many different trees and flowers.
The caves are owned by the local Wilkinson Trust, and are open to the public.

Fig Pudding

Fig Pudding is a young adult novel written by Ralph Fletcher. It was first published in 1995. The novel was recommended as one of the ten best books of 1995 by the American Library Association.
Cliff is eleven years old and the oldest of six children in his family who live in Ballingsford. As Christmas nears, Cliff's grandmother arrives for a visit. Cliff's baby brother is rushed to the hospital with a severe illness. While he is getting better in the hospital on Christmas Eve his family finally figure out that he has been asking Santa Claus for a little ladder like the one used to climb up to the top of a bunk bed. The whole family work together to build Josh a ladder and deliver it him on Christmas morning. Later, Cliff's first grade brother Brad, drives his bicycle into an ambulance and dies. The family spends the next Christmas at a resort trying to adjust to the loss of Brad but the trip does not seem to work. Their spirits rise during a New Year's party at Aunt Pat's house. When they arrive at the party Josh steps by mistake into Dad's special fig pudding. Dad removes the shoe, smooths down the pudding and swears the children to secrecy. They all keep a straight face until Uncle Eddie says that the fig pudding is the best ever and asks Dad if he has added some new ingredient. They all laugh when the real story of the shoe is told. 
"Fig Pudding" is written using an episodic plot style.
Chris Sherman in his review for "Booklist" said that "Fletcher captures perfectly the humor, irritations, and sadness of life in a large, close-knit family and makes Cliff a sympathetic and thoughtful narrator, occasionally bewildered by his siblings' antics but always a completely believable older brother. The comedy in the final chapter will leave readers recalling hilarious family disasters of their own." Elizabeth Devereaux in her review for "Publishers Weekly" said this novel "neatly blends the humor and frustrations of growing up in a large family."

<doc id="206439" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=206439" title="Solar panel">
Solar panel

Solar panels get energy from the sun for people to use. There are two types of solar panels, those that collect heat (thermal), and those that produce electricity (photovoltaic). Heat from solar panels is often used for space heating and for hot water. 
Solar panels collect renewable energy. In the 20th century some used the heat of the sun to make steam for a steam engine to turn a generator. Nowadays producing electricity from the sun's light is cheaper. This is a solid state way of producing electricity, meaning that it has no moving parts. Solar panels are often mounted on rooftops. Commercial or industrial installations are often on trackers mounted on the ground. The trackers point the panel towards the sun as the sun moves across the sky. Solar panels are also commonly used in outer space, where they are one of the few power sources available.
Solar panels for heat are usually made from a box with a clear window on top. Pipes run through the box. The pipes and the box are usually painted black because black absorbs more heat than other colors. The pipes are filled with a heat transfer fluid such as water or oil. A pump circulates the fluid, which heats up as it is exposed to the sun. When the hot fluid leaves the panel, it goes into a heat exchanger, which transfers the heat into water or air. After the now cool fluid leaves the heat exchanger, it is pumped back up into the panel to collect heat again.
, or Solar Panels, are built to last about thirty years. So far, most of the solar panels, originally created in the 1980's have not yet reached the end of their estimated lifespans. Many of the solar panels which have expired, however, have been classified as hazardous waste. The used solar panels that haven't been considered dangerous can be recycled to create new solar panels. Over 90% of the solar panel is recyclable to create either new solar panels or scrap material. First, the panels are broken down by removing the metal frames and glass plate, leaving the group of solar cell sandwiched between an resin and back film. To actually get to the solar cells themselves, the resin and backing must be removed. 
The top ten uses for solar panels include,
Solar panels have become much cheaper to use, compared to oil, diesel and liquified natural gas in parts of Asia. Solar energy will soon become the main source of energy. Over the years many innovations have been made to improve solar panels. Solar panels have been used for space exploration and are being developed to be able to power cars. Along with this, scientists are developing solar cells in silicone to increase its convenience. 
Solar shingles are a new type of solar panel that look like ordinary asphalt roof shingles. They are used where the appearance of traditional solar panels might be undesirable, such as on residential rooftops. Solar shingles are more expensive and less durable than normal solar panels.

Vaginoplasty is surgery to shape a vagina. Some babies are born with a problem where the vagina did not grow right. Doctors fix this with a vaginoplasty. Some women do not like how their vagina looks or feels. They can ask for a vaginoplasty. Some transsexual women ask for a vaginoplasty when they go from male to female.
There are many ways to do a vaginoplasty. Most use tissue from other parts of the body of the patient. They can use tissue from inside the mouth, skin tissue, the vaginal labia, or the intestines. For transsexual women, they can use the penis and scrotum to make a vagina, but they must continue to dilate the new vagina to keep it by a tool.

Ichthyophthirius multifiliis

Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, also called "white spot disease", "ick" or "ich" is a disease that causes little white spots on fresh water fish. It is one of the most common parasites of fish. It often affects pet fish in tanks and ponds, as well as farm-raised food fish species. Wild fish populations can also get the parasite.
The "I. multifiliis" life cycle from birth to death depends on the temperature of the water. In warm water, 25 °C (77 °F), the parasite's whole life cycle can take place in seven days. In cold water, 6 °C (43 °F), it can take up to eight weeks.
The disease starts when the parasite digs into the skin of the fish. This causes swelling and white spots to form. After a few days, the parasite turns into a trophozoite, a jelly-like substance. This falls off the fish and lives on the bottom of the tank. Inside the jelly are hundreds of baby parasites called tomites. These eventually can swim by themselves and go looking for another fish to live in.
Fish may have Ichthyophthirius multifiliis without there being anything to see. Fish owners need to be careful about where they get their fish from, as the disease can spread very easily. There are a number of different ways to try to get rid of the parasite. One method is to heat the water to kill the parasites in the water before they can infect the fish. Another method is to add salt to the water, or put the fish into a salt water bath. The water should be changed frequently to remove the parasites. Chemicals are also available which will kill "Ichthyophthirius multifiliis". All these treatments need to be carefully planned for the type of fish species.
Fish with the disease will:

Pneumothorax

Pneumothorax (sometimes called "collapsed lung") is a health problem where air or gas is in the pleural space (the space between the lung and the pleura). The pleura is a slim membrane that covers the lungs. The two parts of the pleura usually touch. A hole might grow in the surface of the lung. Air then enters between the pleura and the lung. The lung will collapse. If enough air gets into the pleural space, it can also push against other organs or parts in the chest, like the heart or the aorta. Pneumothorax is a medical emergency.
There are two main types of pneumothorax. These are a Closed Pneumothorax, and an Open Pneumothorax. These are also known as Simple Pneumothorax and Complex Pneumothorax.
The most common symptoms of Pneumothorax are chest pains. The chest pains can be sharp, dull, or stabbing. Some other symptoms of Pneumothorax are shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and coughing.
Pneumothorax happens when there is an injury. Some examples of injuries are fractured ribs, knifes, or lung diseases. Pneumothorax also happens when there is a hole in the surface of the lung. One can avoid this disease by not smoking.
Simple Pneumothorax will heal by itself. Complex pneumothorax will need medical attention. One should treat respiratory problems as soon as they occur.
Closed pneumothorax is when air or gas gets in the pleural space without any outside wound. This sometimes happens when the lung is already injured somehow, like from diseases such as cancer or cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is a disease in the lungs. Glands in the body make large amounts of thick mucus. The mucus blocks ducts and passageways.
The most common cause of closed pneumothorax is called spontaneous pneumothorax. The cause of spontaneous pneumothorax is not known.
Open pneumothorax is when air gets into the pleural space from an injury to the chest. This can happen with stab wounds, like from a knife. It can also happen after a gunshot injury. The injury is most dangerous if the wound lets air in when the injured person (or animal) breathes, but does not let it back out. Sometimes this is called a "sucking chest wound."

Daughter of the Forest is a fantasy novel by Juliet Marillier first published in 1999 It is based on "The Six Swans" (a story that has many versions, one of which is by the Brothers Grimm). A girl must sew six shirts from a painful plant in order to save her brothers from a witch's curse. She must not speak until the task is finished.
Sorcha, the seventh child of Irish Lord Colum of Sevenwaters, has been raised by her six older brothers. Having lost her mother at birth, Sorcha is almost ignored by her father. Her father's new wife, the Lady Oonagh, attacks Sorcha and her brothers. Sorcha alone is able to flee into the forest and escape. Sorcha's brothers, however, have been turned into swans.
The story is a twist on the classic tale of "The Six Swans." Sorcha learns that if she can spin six shirts from a painful plant she can free her brothers from the spell. But she must not speak until the last one has been finished. Sorcha agrees to this and spends several years in the forest hiding as she works on the shirts.
After several years of hard work, Sorcha is saved from drowning by a British lord, Hugh of Harrowfield (known as "Red"). When Red returns to Britain, Sorcha accompanies him. Red believes that Sorcha knows something about his brother, Simon. Sorcha had nursed Simon back to health after his capture by Lord Colum. Sorcha stays with Red as she works on the shirts.
While in Britain, Sorcha finds a new danger in the form of Lord Richard, Red's uncle. Sorcha must fend off the attacks of Richard as she works to save her brothers.

Hyracotherium

Hyracotherium was previously called "Eohippus" (meaning "dawn horse"). It is a Eurasian species ancestral to the horse, but not the same animal as "Eohippus". 
"Hyracotherium" lived during the early Eocene epoch, about 5545 million years ago. It lived in the northern hemisphere in Asia and Europe. The first fossils of this tiny horse were found in England by Richard Owen in 1841 and named "Hyracotherium".
The type species, "H. leporinum", is now regarded as a paleothere, ancestral to both horses and brontotheres. "Eohippus" has been brought back as a name, to describe the early proto-horse found in North America. The main stream of horse evolution occurred on the North American continent.

Hurricane Keith

Hurricane Keith was the strongest hurricane of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season. Keith struck Belize and Mexico before it died on October 6. Keith killed 24 people and left $225 million in damage. Most of this damage happened in Belize. It was because it struck Belize while stronger than when it struck Mexico.
The beginning of the hurricane was from a tropical wave that moved into the Atlantic Ocean off of Africa on September 16. The wave moved across much of the Caribbean Sea, until September 28, at that time it became Tropical Depression Fifteen. Fifteen moved a little northwest and became Tropical Storm Keith on September 29. 
Keith changed its course and moved west. On September 30 Keith became a hurricane. Keith rapidly gained strength and later on September 30, Keith reached its highest wind speed with which at 140 mph. The hurricane was blocked and was forced to make a loop. 
Since Keith was close to land, the block caused Keith to weaken a lot. On October 2 as a weak hurricane, Keith made landfall in Ambergris Caye, Belize. The next day, Keith made another landfall in Belize, this time in Belize City as a very strong tropical storm.
Keith moved over Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula and weakened to a tropical depression. Tropical Depression Keith moved off of the Peninsula and into the Gulf of Mexico, where it quickly became a tropical storm again. 
On October 4, Keith again became a hurricane. Hurricane Keith made its last landfall in Mexico near Tampico in Tamaulipas on October 5. Keith weakened over Mexico until it finally died on October 6. 
The name Keith was retired in the Spring of 2001. The name Kirk was put on the list in 2006, but Kirk was not used, so it must be used again in 2012.

Degree (mathematics)

The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of x that occurs inside that polynomial. 
For example: if we look at the polynomial formula_1, then we can see that the degree of this polynomial is 3 because the highest power of x that occurs is formula_2.

In math, there are many subjects. One of these is group theory. In group theory, the Monster group (shortened to "M" or "F") is important. It is also called the Fischer-Griess Monster, or the Friendly Giant. It is a group of finite order, which is equal to:
It is a "simple group". Simple groups have only two normal subgroups: the identity element, and "M".
The finite simple groups have been completely classified (the classification of finite simple groups). There are two kinds of finite simple groups in the list of finite simple groups. The first kind has 18 countably infinite families. The second kind has 26 sporadic groups. They are not as systematic. The Monster group is the largest of these sporadic groups. It contains all but six of the other sporadic groups inside of it. Robert Griess has called these six exceptions pariahs. The rest make up the happy family.

The Supremes

The Supremes were an American female singing group. It was originally founded as The Primettes in Detroit, Michigan, in 1959. Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, and Florence Ballard sang in the group. They recorded music for Motown records. The Supremes' were known for their doo-wop, pop, soul, and disco.
The Supremes were the most commercially successful of Motown's acts. They are, to date, America's most successful vocal group, with 12 number one singles on the "Billboard" Hot 100. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team, Holland–Dozier–Holland. At their peak in the mid-1960s, the Supremes rivaled the Beatles in worldwide popularity. Their success made it possible for future African American R&B and soul musicians to find mainstream success.
Founding members Florence Ballard, Mary Wilson, Diana Ross, and Betty McGlown, all came from a public housing project in Detroit. They formed the Primettes as the sister act to the Primes (with Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks, who went on to form the Temptations). Barbara Martin replaced McGlown in 1960, and the group signed with Motown the following year as the Supremes. Martin left the act in early 1962, and Ross, Ballard, and Wilson carried on as a trio.
During the mid-1960s, the Supremes achieved mainstream success with Ross as lead singer. In 1967, Motown president Berry Gordy renamed the group Diana Ross & the Supremes, and replaced Ballard with Cindy Birdsong. Ross left to pursue a solo career in 1970 and was replaced by Jean Terrell, at which point the group's name reverted to the Supremes. After 1972, the lineup changed more frequently; Lynda Laurence, Scherrie Payne, and Susaye Greene all became members of the group during the mid-1970s. The Supremes disbanded in 1977 after an 18-year run.

Paper Mario is a roleplaying video game for the Nintendo 64, first sold in 2000. It was later sold for Virtual Console on the Wii in 2007. It is Mario's second role playing game.
A mail Paratroopa, later in the game known as Parakarry, lends a letter to Mario and Luigi, who are at home in their house. The letter is from Princess Peach. She asks Mario and Luigi to come to a party of hers. So Mario and Luigi set out. The party is set in Princess Peach's Castle. While Luigi stays in the lobby, Mario goes upstairs to find Peach. Peach asks Mario to come with her so they can chat in peace. But as soon as they begin to walk, the castle begins to crumble. The player can see that the castle is actually raising into space, but Peach and Mario are confused, especially since they can see stars outside in the middle of the day. Then, all of a sudden, King Bowser smashes through the window riding his Koopa Clown Car. He has his companion Kammy Koopa with him. As soon as Bowser tells Peach and Mario that he was the one who lifted the castle into space using the Star Rod with the purpose of kidnapping Peach, Mario begins to fight him, despite the failures of the past. However, this time, just as Bowser says, is different, because Bowser has the Star Rod. In the middle of the fight, he transforms himself into Rainbow Bowser, making him stronger and invincible. Of course, there is no way Mario can defeat Bowser now. So Bowser simply destroys Mario. After his job is done, he throws Mario out into space, followed by Koopatrols taking Peach to her room. Meanwhile, Mario falls miles towards the Earth.

Check and checkmate

Check is a term in chess when a player's king is attacked. If the king is in check, the player "must" find a way to stop the threat; he can not just ignore it. The player must do one of these things:
If none of these works, then it is not a check but "checkmate". 
Checkmate (often called mate) is when a player's king is attacked (in check) and there is no way to meet that attack. Or, simply put, the king is under attack and cannot get out of being captured. Giving checkmate is the main goal in chess: a player who is mated loses the game.
These rules have been part of chess since its beginning. Until the early 20th century is was customary to announce "Check!" verbally when making the move. It would be regarded as strange today; players do not address each other in competitive chess except where necessary.
Until the 19th century it was customary to warn one's opponent when attacking his queen: "Check to the queen!" Most players today do not know this was ever done.

A Mixed government or mixed constitution is a form of government where different sized groups of people control different types of issues. It integrates different forms of government, like democracy, oligarchy, and monarchy. Mixed government means that there are some issues where the state is governed by the majority of the people, in some other issues the state is governed by few, in some other issues by a single person, often defined in a constitution. Today, this idea is commonly seen as a precursor to that of separation of powers.
Mixed governments was common in Ancient Rome.

Son of the Shadows

Son of the Shadows is a fantasy novel by Juliet Marillier and the second book in the Sevenwaters Trilogy first published in 2000. It follows the path of Sorcha and Red's third child, Liadian, a girl who lives outside the pattern of the 'Fair Folk', also known as Túatha Dé Danann. "Son of the Shadows" won the 2001 Aurealis Awards for Fantasy Novel.
In this novel, Liadan grows up in Sevenwaters with her twin brother Sean and her older sister Niamh. They are the children of Sorcha and Iubdan (formerly Hugh of Harrowfield). Liadan follows in her mothers tradition in learning the healing arts. Niamh has great beauty and is 'expected' to wed Eamonn, a nearby chieftan. Eamonn actually asks for the hand of Liadan, she says that she will give him an answer in one year. While staying at Sevenwaters, Eamonn tells a tale of a recent attack by a band of mercenaries. Upon this attack, all his men were killed, and his life was spared by a man called the Painted Man. He swears that he will kill him. During the festival of Imbolc, a young druid named Ciarán tells the story of Aengus Óg and Caer Ibormeith and catches the fancy of Niamh. They are soon having a secret love affair. Liadan discovers their secret during a walk in the forest. When the truth comes out, Ciarán leaves the Druids and Sevenwaters and Niamh is forced to marry the Uí Néill chieftan, Fionn.
Liadan goes with her sister on the trip to her new home. On the way back she is kidnapped by an outlaw and brought to the camp of "The Painted Man" in order to try to save the life of their smith who was hurt in an accident. She accepts the task and eventually falls in love with Bran, their leader. When Bran finds out that she is the daughter of Hugh of Horrowfield, he sends her back home. When she returns to Sevenwaters, she finds she is pregnant with Bran's child. The Tuatha Dé Danann demand that she and her son remain in the forest, but she refuses to comply. With the help of Finbar she realizes that she has his gift of sight and can read and heal the minds of others.
Sean, Liadan's brother and heir to Sevenwaters, wants to buy the Painted Man's fighting men in their long battle for the sacred islands. All of the leaders go to a meeting to discuss the feud with the Britons. Liadan and her sister visit Sean's future bride and Eamonn's sister at his estate called Sídhe Dubh. During this visit Liadan discovers that her sisters husband has been beating her. She uses her mind gifts to help Niamh. With the help of Bran they plan on secretly taking Niamh out of Sídhe Dubh and take her to a Christian nunnery where she can be safe. At the last moment Eamonn and Fionn return and attack Bran and Gull as they escape with Niamh. Eamonn returns from the chase and tells the tale of how Naimh slips on the rocks and fell into the bog and died. All that remained was a cord that Liadan made for Niamh that held a white stone given to her by Ciarán.
Liadan finally gives birth to her son. Her mother and father realize when the child is born that his father (Bran) must have been the son of John and Margery, kinsman of Iubdan when he was Lord of Horrowfield. Liadan names the child Johnny. Shortly after the birth of Johnny, Sorcha dies. But before her death Liadan tells Sorcha, Iubdin and Finbar the story of Niamh's abuse by her husband; the escape from Sídhe Dubh with the help of Bran; and her belief that Niamh is not dead. On her deathbed Sorcha tells Iubdin that he must return to Harrowfield and learn the truth about John and Margery's son. Ciarán returned in hiding as a tinker during the ceremory for Sorcha. He tells Liadan that Niamh is indeed alive and safe. He also tells her the truth of why they could not wed. Ciarán is the son of Lord Colum and the Lady Oonah, he is half brother to Niamh's mother. So their union was forbidden by blood. This was why they were not allowed to wed and that he could never be a druid since he carried the blood of the sorceress Lady Oonah. Ciarán gives Liadan a gift for helping rescue Niamh for her abusive husband and returning her to Ciarán, a mysterious raven named Fiacha.
Bran comes to Sevenwaters in secret to meet with Sean and meets Liadan, she tells him of his son. After Bran leaves, Liadan has a vision of her Uncle Liam's death; a vision of Eamonn telling Aisling that she could not marry Sean and then her suicide. They then learn that Fionn was recently killed in his sleep. Liam was indeed killed by a Britons arrow and his nephew Sean takes control of Sevenwaters. Sean fearful for Aisling convinces Liadan to go to Sídhe Dubh to bring Aisling back so they can be married. Liadan has had visions of Eamonn torturing Bran. When she arrives at Sídhe Dubh she learns from Eamonn that he indeed has Bran held prisoner. She makes a deal with Eamonn, in exchange for not revealing that Eamonn betrayed his kinsman Liam and sacrificed his life in exchange for the Painted Man capture. Aisling will be allowed to go Sevenwaters and Liadan can leaves with Bran and Gull if she can find them and leave before dusk. With the help of some magic and Fiacha they make it safely through the bog that surrounds Sídhe Dubh. Liadan learns Bran's hidden truth about his childhood during her fight to bring him back from the torture inflicted on him. She reveals this to her father Iubdin and she convinces Bran that his future might lie in returning to his roots at Harrowfield in Briton, while his men talk of setting up a school for warriors.
Publishers Weekly said that "The story, though a bit light on the magic and heavy on the romantic, is reminiscent of Jennifer Roberson's Chesuli series. Fantasy addicts should love it".
Jackie Cassada in "The Library Journal" said "Marillier blends old legends with original storytelling to produce an epic fantasy that belongs in most libraries".
"Booklist" in 2001 said that "Marillier's virtuosic pacing and vivid, filmic style make this an engaging continuation of one of the last year's best fantasies".

The Green Mile is a 1999 American drama movie. It was released on December 10, 1999 in the United States. It stars Tom Hanks, David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, and Michael Clarke Duncan. It was directed by Frank Darabont.
In Louisiana in 1935, inmates at the Cold Mountain Correctional Facility call Death Row "The Green Mile" because of the dark green linoleum that tiles the floor. Paul Edgecomb (played by Tom Hanks) is the head guard on the Green Mile when a new inmate arrives: John Coffey (played by Michael Clarke Duncan), who is to be executed for the murder of two young girls. Despite his size and the fearsome crimes for which he's serving time, Coffey seems to be a kind and well-mannered person who behaves more like an innocent child than a hardened criminal. Soon Edgecomb and two of his fellow guards, Howell (played by David Morse) and Stanton (played by Barry Pepper), notice something odd about Coffey: he's able to perform what seem to be miracles of healing, like bringing a dead mouse back to life, leading them to wonder just what sort of person he could be, and if he could have done the crimes with which he was charged.

Head scarf

Headscarves are scarves covering most or all of the top of a woman's hair and her head. Headscarves may be worn for a variety of purposes, such as for warmth, for sanitation, for fashion or social distinction; with religious significance, to hide rampant baldness, out of modesty, or other forms of social convention.
Headscarves may have specific religious significance. Observant married Orthodox Jewish women, for example, are required to cover their hair, often employing scarves (or sometimes wigs) for the purpose. Headscarves were also worn by married Christian women in Medieval Europe, and even among some of the unmarried. This headcovering habit is better known as a wimple in English.
Islamic law says that women should dress in a special way. This dress code applies to women and adolescent girls, but not to children.
Headscarves and veils used for Muslim religious dress include:
Note that the Arabic word "hijab" refers to modest behaviour in general, and pertains to men and women, but it is sometimes used in other languages to describe the Muslim headscarf, also known as a "khimar".
Some English speakers use the word "babushka" (grandma in Russian) to indicate the headscarf tied below the chin, as commonly worn in Eastern Europe. In most parts of Eastern Europe, headscarves are used mainly by elderly women (grandmothers) and this led the incorrect use of the "babushka" term. In Russia they are worn by women when they go to church to show their convictions to Russian Orthodoxy.
A plain red or scarlet headscarf was worn by female commissars and other women aligning themselves with Bolshevism in times of Russian Revolution and civil war.
A head tie is a west and southern African women's head scarf, specifically an elaborate ornamental head covering.
The Keffiyeh is commonly used by Muslim men.
Ancien Egyptiant men wore a Nemes headcloth.

Laika

Laika (; c. 1954 – November 3, 1957) was a Soviet Union space dog. She was one of the first animals in space, and the first animal to orbit the Earth. She was a mix of either a Siberian Husky or other Nordic breed, and a terrier. NASA refers to Laika as a "part-Samoyed terrier." The reason for sending a dog into space was to get information about the behavior of living organisms in a space environment. Information from the flight led to the discovery of solar (from the sun) and cosmic radiation.
Laika had been a stray dog living in the streets of Moscow. She underwent training with two other dogs. She was then chosen as the dog to go up in the Soviet spacecraft Sputnik 2. It was launched into outer space on November 3, 1957. 
Not much was known about how spaceflight would affect living animals at the time of Laika's mission. There was also no way, at that time, to bring the satellite back down to Earth. So all the scientists knew there would be no way for Laika to survive her trip. It was necessary to send a dog first as a test, because it was not thought that humans could live in outer space. 
Before her trip in Sputnik, one of the scientists took Laika home to play with his children. Dr. Vladimir Yazdovsky wrote: "Laika was quiet and charming...I wanted to do something nice for her: She had so little time left to live."
One of the technicians getting the capsule ready before final lift-off said that "after placing Laika in the container and before closing the hatch, we kissed her nose and wished her "bon voyage", knowing that she would not survive the flight."
Laika died within hours from overheating. Her body temperature got way too hot for her to survive. The heat in her spacecraft had quickly risen to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). The true cause and time of her death were hidden from people until 2002. Instead, it was reported that she died when her oxygen ran out on day six. Another untruth, as the Soviet government first said, was that she was euthanised (put to sleep) before her oxygen ran out.
In the Soviet Union, during the following years, no one openly questioned the decision to send a dog into space. It was not until 1998, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, that Oleg Gazenko, one of the top-level scientists responsible for sending Laika into space, said he was sorry for allowing her to die:
Over five months later, after 2,570 orbits, Sputnik 2 burned up—along with Laika's remains—during re-entry on April 14, 1958.
On April 11, 2008, Russian officials opened a monument to Laika. It was built near the military research facility in Moscow which prepared Laika's space flight. It is of a dog standing on top of a rocket.
She also appears on the Monument to the Conquerors of Space in Moscow.
Laika & the Cosmonauts, a Finnish surf rock band, were named for Laika. They formed in 1987.

Civil law

Civil law, as a system of law, is different from common law, which is another system of law. The origin of the civil law system of law is ancient Rome. The civil law system is used in countries such as Germany, France, many countries which were colonies of those European countries before, and in some Asian countries. It also been adopted in Latin America as well as in some parts of Asia and some African countries. There are about 150 countries worldwide that use mainly civil law systems. About 80 countries use the common law system.
Civil law's very name indicates where it started. Called is was the civil law during the Roman Republic and the later Roman Empire. It started in the 2nd century BC. By the end of the Republic, about 27 BC, a number of experts in the law called "jurists" (not to be confused with judges) became prominent. They were mostly members of the upper classes. Jurists provided their services to counsel people and advise judges who presided over trials. An important feature of Roman law was it did not depend on legal precedent by earlier cases but on the facts and merits of the current case. 
In the 6th century, Justinian compiled the "Corpus Juris Civilis", a simplified code of Roman laws. It was used by the Byzantine Empire. The medieval Church based much of its Canon law on Roman law.
Germanic law, known as "leges barbarorum", written between the 5th and 9th centuries borrows from the Roman civil law.
Civil law developed in Europe during the middle age, about the same time common law developed in England. During the Renaissance, England's common law system borrowed from civil law. While the common law was the traditional law system in England by this time, Equity is based on civil law. Other features were borrowed and used in maritime law and in wills, trusts and estates. The Napoleonic Code, which borrowed much from Roman law, influenced many of the legal systems in Europe and was the foundation for Prussian civil law.
Civil law is based on rules and concepts that come from Roman law. The rules and principles of civil law are found in codes which are available to both citizens and legal professionals. These codes clearly explain everyone's rights and duties. Unlike common law, in civil law judges have a different role. In criminal cases they establish the facts of a case and use the applicable codes. In many countries, judges also bring the formal charges. Unlike common law, precedent is not used to rule in later cases. In this system the legislature passes statutes that are then applied by the courts. Judges look to the statutes instead of precedent in deciding a case.

Hurricane Klaus was a weak hurricane of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season. Klaus moved very close to islands like Antigua and Martinique, while it was a hurricane. The remains of Klaus moved over the Southeastern United States and killed 4 people with Tropical Storm Marco, which was close by. Klaus killed 11 people and cause a little bit more than $1 million in damage.
In the Spring of 1991, France requested that the name Klaus be retired, because of what it did in Martinique. So the National Hurricane Center retired the name Klaus. The name Kyle was used in 1996, 2002, and 2008 instead.

Sherwood Anderson

Sherwood Anderson (September 13, 1876 – March 8, 1941) was an American writer. He is most famous for his book "Winesburg, Ohio". Anderson is said to have had a big influence on some of the most famous American writers such as Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and John Steinbeck.
Anderson was born in Camden, Ohio. He was the third of seven children. Anderson’s father, Erwin Anderson, had a business which failed. After this, the Anderson family had to move house often, finally settling in Clyde, Ohio. Erwin Anderson began drinking heavily and died in 1895. Sherwood Anderson took a number of jobs to help support his family and he left school at the age of 14.
Anderson moved to Chicago. He worked there until just before 1900, when he signed up for the United States Army. In 1900, Anderson went to Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio. He eventually went back to Chicago to take up a writing job.
In 1904, he married Cornelia Lane. Lane came from a rich family in Ohio. They lived in Cleveland, Ohio and then in Elyria, Ohio. Anderson had three children and ran a number of businesses.
In November 1912, Anderson had a mental breakdown. He left his wife and three children and decided to become a creative writer. He moved back to Chicago, but took a job in advertising and publishing. Anderson divorced Cornelia in 1916 and got married to Tennessee Mitchell.
In 1916, Anderson’s first book, "Windy McPherson’s Son", was released. In 1919, Anderson’s most famous book, "Winesburg, Ohio", was released. "Winesburg, Ohio" was a collection of short stories about life in a town in Ohio.
In 1922, Anderson divorced Tennessee Mitchell. He got married again in 1924, to Elizabeth Prall. This marriage did not last either. Anderson married again in the late 1920s – this time to Eleanor Copenhaver. 
His later books were not considered to be as good as his earlier works. Ernest Hemingway openly voiced this opinion on more than one occasion. 
Anderson died in Panama on the 8th March, 1941, at the age of 64. He was buried in Marion, Virginia. The writing on his gravestone reads "Life, Not Death, is the Great Adventure."

Selectivity (electronic)

The principle of Selectivity (Discrimination) is based upon an analysis of several circuit breaker characteristics. These include time-current (tripping) curves, peak-let-through-current (Ipeak) and energy let-through (I²T).
The maximum selectivity level with two nominated breakers in series under short-circuit conditions is often stated by vendors in Technical Reference manuals.
Selectivity can be enhanced beyond the breaking capacity of the downstream breaker provided it is backed up by an appropriately selected upstream breaker, which should not trip (unlatch) under the stated short circuit current. 
Selectivity works as the upstream breaker heats up under fault conditions providing impedance in the fault circuit reducing the overall fault severity.

Wikipedia:Potential, not just current state

Potential, not just current state relates to the debate on whether articles in the should be deleted, merged, or kept based on their current potential to be an encyclopedic entry, or as they are now. Wikipedia is constantly changing and evolving, and it is frequently better to think of the potential of an article as well as how it looks at present.
Many articles are created on Wikipedia every day, most of which are a effort by contributors to improve the encyclopedia. Preferably the first revision of all new articles would be enough so the suitability of an article for inclusion in the encyclopedia could be assessed without needing to look at potential. In practice however due to Wikipedia's open nature of being the 'The free encyclopedia that anyone can edit', articles are and will be created which do not follow Wikipedia's fully but have the potential to do so. While encouraging when creating articles is desirable, contributors, particularly users new to Wikipedia, cannot be expected to build an article perfectly at first attempt. should be given for input from multiple editors to allow improvements to be made.
The concept of potential is recognised in the guideline under . It suggests that if an article does not demonstrate notability, editors should make a good faith search for sources before or .
There are several simple methods that can be used to help determine if an article has potential, even if it is relativity short. An article could have potential if:
In most cases deletion of an article should be a last resort in the event that the article's topic is not notable and has no potential for its own encyclopedic entry on Wikipedia. Deletion of a article can be one step backwards in creating an encyclopedic entry for a notable topic. It is frequently a better option to do one or more of the following:
This will allow for editors in the long-term to improve the article to address all concerns. Keeping articles with potential encourages editors, especially unregistered users, to and improve the article to allow it to evolve over time. Having to re-create an article from scratch often takes a long time and can result in a long-term loss of encyclopedic information from Wikipedia. 
Note however that an article should have "immediate" potential, as . In cases where an article could have potential in the future but does not now, it should be merged or redirected appropriately if possible, so it can be easily re-created when potential is gained.
Merging an article on a topic with narrow scope into an article with a larger scope can frequently be a good solution to issues of a topic not being notable or enough for its own Wikipedia article entry. However, merging an article which has potential to be successful as a standalone article in the long-run can constrain encyclopedia expansion, cause articles to specialise in one subject area, and possibly result in . It is frequently a better option to do one or more of the following:
These options help navigation and allow the encyclopedia to flow, while also encouraging long-term article expansion.
Frequently the concept can be applied when becoming involved with a variety of Wikipedia processes.
If you have just created an article and it is nominated for , it can be sensible to add the tag and then to state on the article's talk page that you are still working on the article. It can also help to explain your aims for the article and its potential notability. Often adding context to the article will help in the short-term to establish the potential of an encyclopedic entry on a topic.
If an article is and you think the article has potential to address the concerns raised, such as notability, then you can simply remove the template from the article. It is polite to state (often on the article's talk page) why you think the article should be kept; such as citing sources (often those on the internet) that the article can use giving the topic notability and making deletion unnecessary. If an article is deleted by the proposed deletion process, it is possible to make a request to a to undelete it, based on its potential for improvement and expansion.
Articles are frequently because of their current state, not their potential as an encyclopedic entry. These nominations can often result in "de facto" time limits of about seven days (changed from five in April 2009) for an article to either improve, or be deleted and sometimes merged. This can cause problems, as frequently editors simply do not have time to fix articles within such a short time period. In these cases it is helpful to alert the discussion that the article has potential to be made into a successful encyclopedic entry, and that more time is needed to improve the article. It can also be helpful to quickly remove content of an article which is causing problems, and to add templates to the article as necessary.
Sometimes it will be suggested that an article be merged with another article. If you are against a merge because you think the article's topic is notable enough for its own entry, it is sensible to explain why on the article's talk page. When discussing mergers it is also wise to think of the long-term, such as the possibility of an article getting too long.

Half-staff or half-mast describes a flag being displayed at halfway up a flagpole or a ship's mast. This is done in many countries as a symbol of respect, mourning, or distress, or a form of honor.
The flag does not always have to be flown at exactly the half-way point, sometimes it is acceptable to have the "half-mast" flag at slightly lower or slightly higher than the middle of the flagpole or mast. Originally, "half-staff" meant that the flag had to be flown one flag-width from the top to allow for the "invisible flag of mourning" to be at the top.

<doc id="207690" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=207690" title="Navier–Stokes equations">
Navier–Stokes equations

The Navier–Stokes equations are mathematical equations that describe the motion of fluids. The equations are named after Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes. The equations result from applying Newton's second law to fluid dynamics with the belief that the fluid stress is the sum of a diffusing viscous term (in relation to the gradient of velocity), plus a pressure term.
They are very useful because they describe the physics of many things of academic and economic interest. They may be used to model the weather, ocean currents, water flow in a pipe, the air's flow around a wing, and motion of stars inside a galaxy. The Navier–Stokes equations in their full and simplified forms help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and many other things. Together with Maxwell's equations they can be used to model and study magnetohydrodynamics.
The Navier–Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Somewhat surprisingly, given their wide range of practical uses, mathematicians have not yet proven that in three dimensions solutions always exist (existence), or that if they do exist, then they do not contain any singularity (or infinity or ) (smoothness). These are called the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problems. The Clay Mathematics Institute has called this one of the seven most important open problems in mathematics, and offered a US$1,000,000 prize (approx. €0.7M or £0.6M as of September 2009) for a solution or a counter-example.
The Navier–Stokes equations dictate not position but rather velocity. A solution of the Navier–Stokes equations is called a velocity field or flow field, which is a description of the velocity of the fluid at a given point in space and time. Once the velocity field is solved for, other quantities of interest (such as flow rate or drag force) may be found. This is different from what one normally sees in classical mechanics, where solutions are typically trajectories of position of a or of a continuum. Studying velocity instead of position makes more sense for a fluid, however for visualization purposes one can compute various trajectories.

Mary Toft

Mary Toft (née Denyer) (c. 1701–1763), also called Mary Tofts, was an English woman from Godalming, Surrey. In 1726 she tricked doctors into believing that she had given birth to rabbits. She became famous, and was taken to London. There she was examined by royal doctors. Later she confessed, and was sent to prison.
Toft became pregnant in 1726, but later miscarried. She had developed a strong interest in a rabbit she had seen while working, and claimed to have given birth to parts of animals. Local surgeon John Howard was called to see if it was true, and upon delivering several animal parts he told other important doctors. The event came to the attention of Nathaniel St. André, surgeon to the Royal Household of King George I of Great Britain. St. André checked further into the event and decided that Toft was telling the truth. The king also sent surgeon Cyriacus Ahlers to see Toft, but Ahlers did not believe it. By now quite famous, Toft was brought to London and was studied at length. She was watched closely. She produced no more rabbits, and eventually confessed to the hoax and was sent to prison as a fraud.
The public learned of the fact that the doctors had been fooled, and this created panic in the medical profession. Several important surgeons' careers were ruined.

San Fernando de Monte Cristi

San Fernando de Monte Cristi, usually just "Monte Cristi", is a Dominican city and the head municipality of the Monte Cristi province, in the northwest of the country.
The name comes from the name given by Columbus on 4 January 1493 to the mountain known now as "El Morro": "Monte Cristo" or "Monte Christi" ("Mountain of Christ").
The name of the city has been written of different ways: "Monte Cristi" (Columbus), "Monte Cristo" (Ferdinand Columbus), "Monte Christi" or "Monte Christo" (Las Casas), "Monte Cristy" and "Montecristi". But the name most used is Monte Cristi.
When the city was founded again in 1751, the name was changed to the present one, "San Fernando de Monte Cristi", after Ferdinand VI, King of Spain.

The city was founded by Juan de Bolaños in 1533; but Rodríguez says that it was in 1545 by Francisco Mesa. Some families from the Canary Islands came to live here. Because it was too dry and hot, there was not possibility of any kind of farming, except some cattle raising, and the city was developed as a port.
The town was destroyed in 1606 by order of the Spanish government and the inhabitants were moved, together with the inhabitants of Puerto Plata inhabitants, away from the northern coast to form the new town of Monte Plata. In 1751, Monte Cristi was founded again by order of the king Ferdinand VI of Spain.
Monte Cristi is in the northwestern end of the Cibao Valley, near the Montecristi Bay. The city is just to the north of the mouth of the River Yaque del Norte.

Twitter

Twitter is a social networking and microblogging service. Users use mobile phones or computers to send and to read messages, called "tweets". Tweets can be up to 140 characters long. They appear on the user's profile page. Tweets can usually be read by anyone, but senders can also keep messages private. Private tweets only go to their list of friends. Users may subscribe to tweets from other people. This is called "following", and subscribers are known as "followers". As of late 2009, users can also follow lists of authors.
All users can send and receive tweets using the Twitter website. They can also use other applications that work with Twitter on smartphones. Twitter by Short Message Service (SMS) is available in certain countries. Using Twitter is free, but sending or getting tweets by SMS may cost money. The website is based in San Francisco, California. Twitter also has servers and offices in San Antonio, Texas and Boston, Massachusetts, and soon in Salt Lake City, Utah.
Twitter has become very popular worldwide since Jack Dorsey created it in 2006. It now has more than 100 million users. It is sometimes described as the "SMS of the Internet."
Twitter started at a podcasting company Odeo. The company board members had a "daylong brainstorming session." During the meeting, Jack Dorsey introduced the idea of one person using an SMS service to communicate with a small group. At first, they called this project "twttr". It fit the five character length of American SMS short codes and sounded like Flickr. At first, the developers planned to use "10958" as a short code. Later they changed it to "40404" because it was easier to remember and type. Dorsey sent the first Twitter message at 9:50 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) March 21, 2006. The first tweet was, "just setting up my twttr."
The first version of Twitter was only for Odeo employees to use. They opened the full version for anyone to use on July 15, 2006. In October 2006, Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Dorsey, and other members of Odeo started a new company called Obvious Corporation. Obvious Corporation bought Odeo and all of its property–including Odeo.com and Twitter.com–from the investors and shareholders. Twitter became its own separate company in April 2007.
Twitter started becoming very popular after the 2007 South by Southwest (SXSW) festival. During the event, Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000. The Twitter company set up two very large computer screens in the hallways at the conference. These screens only showed Twitter messages. Hundreds of people at the conference checked on what each other were doing by looking at the many tweets. Panelists and speakers talked about Twitter. Bloggers at SXSW described it to others in a very positive way.
Reaction at the festival was very good. Blogger Scott Beale said that Twitter "absolutely rul[ed]" SXSW. Social software researcher Danah Boyd said Twitter "own[ed]" the festival. Twitter staff won the festival's Web Award prize. They said, "we'd like to thank you in 140 characters or less. And we just did!"
On September 14, 2010, Twitter changed the site design and added a new logo.
On October 4, 2010, Evan Williams announced that he would not be CEO any more. Dick Costolo became the new CEO. He had been COO of Twitter. Williams will stay with the company and work on plans for the future of Twitter.
Technology author Steven Johnson described the basic way Twitter works. He called it "remarkably simple." Following is an important part of Twitter as a social network. Users' Twitter home pages show all of the tweets from people they follow. The tweets appear from newest to oldest. Johnson said:
Twitter is mainly used by older adults who might not have used other social sites before Twitter. Jeremiah Owyang studies social media. He said, "Adults are just catching up to what teens have been doing for years." Only 11% of Twitter's users were 12 to 17 years old in September 2009. This may be because Twitter first gained popularity in businesses and news media that attract more older people. Many famous people such as Shaq, Britney Spears, and Ashton Kutcher are Twitter users.
In June 2009, more women than men used Twitter—53% women; 47% men. Only 5% of users made 75% of all tweets. Also, New York had the most Twitter users. 
This is a brief summary of Twitter users as of 3 September 2009. 
Twitter is one of the 10 most visited websites in the world.
People can use software from other companies to access Twitter. These programs are called "third-party applications". The Twitter company changed the way this works on 31 August 2010. Now applications must use OAuth to connect to Twitter. This method means that users do not have to give their passwords to the third-party applications. Changing the login system to OAuth did cause some problems. Using OAuth had been optional and programs used to be able to ask for usernames and passwords. However, now third-party applications that try to use a username and password do not work at all. The Twitter company said that using OAuth will give users "increased security and a better experience."
On April 30, 2009, Twitter changed the way it looks on the web. They added a search bar and a space on the right side of the page with "Trending Topics". That space shows the most common phrases appearing in messages. Biz Stone explained that all messages are instantly indexed and explained the results of the change. The Trending Topics has made Twitter something "unexpectedly important — a discovery engine for finding out what is happening right now."
Sometimes Twitter users experience a problem with the service and cannot access the website. They cannot read or write tweets but only see the "Fail Whale" image created by Yiying Lu,
Twitter worked well approximately 98% of the time in 2007. That is about six full days of no service. The problems were particularly noticeable during events popular with the technology industry such as the 2008 Macworld Conference & Expo keynote address.
Twitter developed several software projects to improve their own service. The company shared these as open source software. Some of these software projects are related to databases, such as the Gizzard Scala framework and a distributed graph database called FlockDB.
t.co is a service created by Twitter to make URLs shorter. It can only be used for links that people post to Twitter. It is not available for other uses. Eventually all links on Twitter will use t.co. The company hopes that the service will protect users from harmful websites. They will also use it to keep a record of people clicking on links in tweets.
Twitter had used the services from other sites such as TinyURL and bit.ly. They began trying their own way of making URLs shorter for direct messages in March 2010. They used the domain, twt.tl, before they bought the t.co domain.
The company is using these accounts to test the service on the main site: @TwitterAPI, @rsarver, and @raffi.
On 2 September 2010, Twitter sent an email message to users to explain that they were starting to open the service to them.
Twitter can also be used as an amateur and professional news source.

<doc id="207762" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=207762" title="Microblog">
Microblog

A microblog is a form of a blog where people send short messages of text or media (pictures, video, or sounds). These messages can be sent to a website and shown to either a small group or to the public. A "microblogger" (someone who uses a microblog) could send their messages from different sources including cell phone text messages, email, instant messages or through a website. 
A microblog is usually different from a normal blog. It has much smaller pieces. A microblog entry can be just one sentence, or a link to an image or short video. A person writing a microblog can use many ideas from "what am I doing now," to Race cars or politics or information about their business or personal life.
Micro blogs are in use in many ways on different websites. They became popular with sites like Twitter where people send messages to each other with text comments or links to other media. Newer sites are also available now which allow you to share media like videos, pictures or sounds directly instead of sending a link. 
Many social networking sites (such as Facebook or MySpace) use a type of microblogging using "status updates" where the person tells their friends what they are thinking or doing. 
A Harvard Business School study found that while most social networking websites are more popular with women microblogging, like Twitter, has been much more popular with men. Both men and women "followed" more men, this allows them to receive the messages that get sent out by the person they followed. 
Micro blogs have also become new sources for news that just happened or is still happening, such as the terrorist attacks on Mumbai in November 2008.
A new idea for Micro blogging has been to turn it into a way to talk to other people about work. It allows a person to give quick news or information to the people they work without sending a lot of emails and without the spam they get in their email account. New companies such as Yammer have been started who want to help allow workers to talk to each other with about work and share what they need.

Omegle

Omegle is website that allows one to talk with one person anonymously and randomly without signing up. The nicknames that are used are "You" and "Stranger". It was started in late March of 2009 by an eighteen-year-old, Leif K-Brooks, who lives in Vermont.
The website has started using a lot of new things in the chat. One thing is that people can chat using webcams. Another feature is that one person can ask something while watching two other strangers discussing it. Usually, the asker can't talk, but he/she can watch them discuss the question. One new feature that people can do is use Facebook Connect to find strangers who have liked the same things on Facebook. You can also type in common interests, these will only connect you to people who have the same interest(s).
The website does not ban users because of their age. A user may experience nudity or sexual content on camera. K-Brooks says, that at one time, he felt "disappointment" at the way in which the site has been used.
Since 2013, Omegle monitors the video chats. There is a moderated video section and an unmoderated video section. The unmoderated video section is for adults who are 18 and over. The moderated video section is for everyone. If someone is seen naked on the moderated video section, they will be banned and only be able to use the unmoderated section.

True Blood

True Blood is an American television show that is broadcast on HBO cable television. It is produced by Alan Ball and stars Anna Paquin as the main character, Sookie Stackhouse, a waitress who can hear people's thoughts. The story is based on the novels "The Southern Vampire Mysteries" written by Charlaine Harris. Most of the events of the TV show occur is a small town in Louisiana named Bon Temps. Although there are other places, like Mississippi, this is one of the main places the show is centered around. On July 15, 2013, it was announced by HBO that the show was renewed for a seventh and final season and would premiere on June 22, 2014.
Two years before the present (what the viewer sees now), vampires "came out of the coffin" (a coined phrase of "coming out of the closet"). After the creation of fake blood (called Tru Blood), vampires are allowed to enter the open and interact with humans (which is called "mainstreaming") more often. They can only come out at night, however (unlike Twilight, vampires will burn to death, until they are a pile of ashes, if they step out into the sunlight). The show is mostly centered around Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), a telepath, better known as a person who can hear the thoughts of others, and how her life changes after she meets vampire Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer). 
2008 - Season 1:
Sookie is a waitress for Merlotte's, a bar owned by her boss, Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammel). A rather lousy couple enters the bar, in Sookie's section. She serves them, and when a vampire enters the bar, the heads turn. She accidentely reads the rather rude couple's mind, and hears them both think that when they leave the bar, they will drain the vampire of his blood, a rather expensive substance used and seen as a drug in the series. Sookie leaves in a haste to stop them, and actually does save him. Something rather strange happens (Sookie gains the man's attention by throwing a chain around his neck, and it seems to squeeze itself around him and stay there), it is shrugged off. The woman, speaking for both of them, vows revenge on Sookie for getting in the way and runs off, with her male counterpart trailing behind her. 
She removes small chains of silver off of him (which leads her to realize that one of a vampire's weaknesses is silver), and he thanks her, before she ends up pulling him out the way when the evil duo try to run him over with their truck. Because she works hard to shut the thoughts of other people out, she finds a surprise when she discovers she cannot hear Bill's thoughts. She learns that Bill is from an old time, and that he inherited his old family house from several hundred years ago.

Wikipedia:How to write Simple English pages

This page describes how to write Simple English articles. Simple English Wikipedia articles are written for everyone. This includes children and adults who are learning English. Articles should be written about encyclopedic subjects. 
First, think about your readers. Many readers of are people whose first language is not English. Other readers may be young (they may be children who don't have much knowledge of English) or have learning difficulties. The language is simple, but the ideas don't have to be. If you find anything wrong, please correct it.
Simple English Wikipedia follows some of the rules of Basic English, but is not so strict about using only a certain number of words. Every day, Simple English changes, and does not have only one word list. A good starting point to writing in Simple English is to learn to write using Basic English words. This helps you to write with a limited vocabulary.
Start with Basic English (BE) . Let us say that your readers know the words. If your writing sounds strange, or is not clear, use a less common word. The less common word may be in BE 1500 or Voice Of America (VOA) Special English.
The example below shows why we do not insist on using only Basic English words. The full English sentence is from Winston Churchill:
Full English: "I have nothing to offer but "blood, toil, tears, and sweat"."
Basic English [BE 850]: "... blood, hard work, drops from eyes, and body water."
Another way is to write the more difficult words, but explain what they mean in parentheses, "(" and ")", if they cannot be linked. For example, write "blood, toil (hard work), tears, and sweat".
Simple sentences are easier to understand than complex ones. The simplest sentence structure in English is "subject-verb-object-period", "subject-verb-object-period" and so on. Try to use the simplest sentences that make sense.
You should begin by writing simple sentences naturally when you add something to Simple Wikipedia. In your mind, do not phrase your sentence obscurely and then try to convert it to something simpler. Get in the habit of thinking in clear, direct English, without unnecessary words. But never be afraid to add a few words to make a sentence clearer. Simple English is "not" shorter English, although it frequently has shorter sentences.
In many cases, simple English "needs" more words than ordinary English. In part this is because of "filler words" (extra words), where the words act as a mental pause, allowing the reader to catch up with your thought. When converting something from the English Wikipedia, it is not uncommon to find that your Simple English article takes up 25% to 50% more words than in standard English. In cases where the original English is poorly structured (usually in an attempt to seem smart to others), you may use much more space.
Remember that this guideline, like all Wikipedia rules, is meant to be used with common sense. It is more important to follow the "spirit" of simple sentence structure than reduce every possible sentence to its simplest form.
1. Always start by using "simple sentences". For example:
and
but, if possible, not
2. Try to avoid "compound sentences" – those with embedded conjunctions (and, or, but, however, etc.) – when possible. Write this:
instead of
"But" this is not a guideline in favor of short sentences. For example:
3. If you must use "complex sentences" – those with both independent clauses (which express a complete thought) and at least one subordinate clause (starting with a word like although, because, who, which, etc.) – try to have only one subordinate clause, like this:
For example:
4. Try not to use "compound-complex sentences", with multiple independent and dependent clauses.
To sum up, the preferred sentence forms are:
Here are some suggestions about how to change complex sentence structures into simpler ones. They can be applied over and over again to the same sentence until you feel the sentence is simple enough for this Wikipedia. Although listed in order of complexity, the ideas can be applied in any order.
1. When you see "and", "or", "but", "for", "so", "yet" and other conjunctions that link two independent thoughts in the same sentence:
<br>    1. Remove the conjunction.
<br>    2. Add a period at the end of the word that preceded the conjunction.
<br>    3. Capitalize the first word that followed the conjunction.
<br>    4. You may have to add new punctuation, usually in the second sentence.
<br>Example: "John Smith walked his dog but later he was tired" becomes "John Smith walked his dog. Later, he was tired".
2. When the subject is missing from the second thought, add the appropriate pronoun.<br>
Example: "John Smith walked his dog and later petted Mary's cat" becomes "John Smith walked his dog. Later, he petted Mary's cat".
3. You can always split a sentence at a semicolon.<br>
Example: "John Smith liked to walk his dog; but today, the dog was sick" becomes "John Smith liked to walk his dog. Today, however, the dog was sick".
4a. When the conjunction expresses significant meaning (usually how or why the subject arrived at the current state), you might consider leaving the conjunction in place as the start of the second sentence.<br>
Example: "John Smith walked his dog but he didn't like it" becomes "John Smith walked his dog. But he did not like it" (here 'but' is the conjunction that now starts the next sentence).<br>
4b. You might also want to change the order of the sentences, and change the conjunction if necessary.<br>
Example: "John Smith walked his dog even though he was very tired" becomes "John Smith was very tired. Even so, he walked his dog".
5. If you see more than one subordinate or dependent clause in a sentence, you can usually isolate all but one by:
<br>    1. Changing the order of the sentences so that the most important information comes first.
<br>    2. Starting all but the first sentence with the filler words: "this" or "this is" or "this was due to" and so forth.<br>
Example: "John Smith walked his dog, which made him angry because the dog always cut into on-coming traffic, which, in turn, made the drivers angry at John, not the dog". This becomes "John Smith was angry while walking his dog. This was because the dog would always cut into on-coming traffic. This, in turn, made the drivers irritated at John, not the dog".
6. When you see a dependent clause occurring in the middle of a sentence (normally separated by commas or parentheses), you can usually detach it and make it a separate sentence, again with the appropriate pronoun.<br>
Example: "John Smith, who was very tired, walked his dog..." becomes "John Smith was very tired. He walked his dog...".
Before changing, these two paragraphs were in the Wikipedia article on the Sun:
After changing, these paragraphs looked like this:
These changes were "not" just a matter of language. It did need some subject-matter understanding. The latest version has changes in the language, and better science, with some sources.

Ian Wallace

Ian Wallace (born 10 July 1919; died 12 October 2009 in London) was a British bass-baritone opera and concert singer, actor and entertainer.
Wallace was born in London and went to school at Charterhouse. He soon became known at school as someone who was good at making people laugh. He learned to sing lots of songs and accompanied himself on the banjolele.
When he wanted to study at university he applied for a choral scholarship at King’s College, Cambridge, but he was not offered a place there, so he went to Trinity Hall. There he studied law and was known for the jokes that he played on people. He also had singing lessons.
Wallace wanted to go into music theatre, but the war broke out and he joined the army. Then he was ill with tuberculosis, but it did not stop him from singing to the people in the hospital.
He took a long time to get better. Gradually he started working in music theatre and then he got a chance to sing in opera. His voice was a bass baritone. He sang with the New London Opera Company in operas such as "La bohème" and "The Barber of Seville". From 1948 to 1961, he regularly sang at Glyndebourne. He usually sang comic parts (known as “buffo roles). 
In 1948 he married Patricia Black. It was a long and happy marriage. The couple adopted two children. 
The Glyndebourne season took place in the summer, so he had plenty of time to do other things the rest of the year. He sang in operas in the BBC studios and often appeared in pantomimes. Then he started to take part in a radio programme called “My Music”. Together with Frank Muir, Dennis Norden, David Franklin and Steve Race he made this programme extremely popular. It was a kind of lighthearted quiz programme with lots of stories and laughter. Wallace was particularly known for singing a song called “The Hippopotamus” by Flanders and Swann.
Wallace continued to sing in opera in the mid-1960s. He sang the roles of Leporello (in "Don Giovanni") and Pistol (in Verdi’s "Falstaff"). He acted on television and in films and appeared at many charity events. He was always very cheerful and friendly and he was liked by a lot of people.
He wrote two autobiographies: "Promise Me You'll Sing Mud" and "Nothing Quite Like It".

Bass-baritone

A bass-baritone is a male singer whose voice is quite low, like a deep baritone, but not quite as low as really deep bass. People started to describe some singers as "bass-baritones" in the 19th century, particularly when the composer Richard Wagner wrote operas which needed singers with that kind of heroic voice. Wagner's roles for bass-baritone include: the Dutchman in Der fliegende Holländer, Wotan/Der Wanderer in the Ring Cycle and Hans Sachs in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. Wagner called these roles "Hoher Bass" ("high bass").
Some bass-baritones often sing baritone roles. Others prefer to sing bass roles.
Famous singers who have been, or are, described as bass-baritone include Hans Hotter, José van Dam, Thomas Quasthoff, Friedrich Schnorr, John Shirley-Quirk, Bryn Terfel and Willard White.

Telus

Telus (TSX: T, T.A; NYSE: TU) is a Canadian company that provides phone, internet, television, and cellular phone service. They are a very large company, one of the largest telecommunication companies in Canada. Telus logo is stylized as TELUS. Telus' head office is in Burnaby, British Columbia. 
Telus was made from a merger of BCTel, the main phone company in British Columbia and Alberta Government Telephones, better known as AGT. AGT was owned by the government of Alberta. AGT wanted to separate from the government and formed a company called Telus in 1990. After that, they combined with BCTel to form the current Telus company in 1999. That remaining Telus company purchased Clearnet Communications, a cell phone company. Clearnet gave them the current style of their advertising, including the slogan "The future is friendly." Telus uses colorful animals to advertise their services.
Telus has cell phone, internet, phone and telephone services. They have a CDMA network for most of their cell phones, but on November 5th, 2009, they started up a new HSPA network, similar to Rogers cell phone network. They have started this with Bell. It allows a very large selection of cell phones.
They have television and internet service based on ADSL service. Telus is the major landline telephone service provider for British Columbia and Alberta.

<doc id="208030" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=208030" title="Minimum spanning tree">
Minimum spanning tree

A number of problems from graph theory are called Minimum spanning tree. In graph theory, a tree is a way of connecting all the vertices together, so that there is exactly one path from any one vertex, to any other vertex of the tree. If the graph represents a number of cities connected by roads, one could select a number of roads, so that each city can be reached from every other, but that there is no more than one way to travel from one city to another.
A graph can have more than one spanning tree, just like there may be more than one way to select the roads between the cities.
Most of the time, graphs are weighted; each connection between two cities has a weight: It might cost something to travel on a given road, or one connection may be longer than the other, this means it takes more time to travel on that connection. In the language of graph theory, the connections are called "edges". 
A minimum spanning tree is a tree. It is different from other trees in that it minimizes the total of the "weights" attached to the edges. Depending on what the graph looks like, there may be more than one minimum spanning tree. In a graph where all the edges have the same weight, every tree is a minimum spanning tree. If all the edges have different weights (that is: there are no two edges with the same weight), there is exactly one minimal spanning tree. 
It can be very simple to make an algorithm that will discover a minimum spanning tree:
In this case, "safe" means that including the edge does not form a cycle in the graph. A cycle means starting at a vertex, travelling to a number of other vertices and ending up at the starting point again without using the same edge twice.
Czech scientist Otakar Borůvka developed the first known algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree, in 1926. He wanted to solve the problem of finding an efficient coverage of Moravia with electricity. Today, this algorithm is known as Borůvka's algorithm.
Two other algorithms are commonly used today. One of them was developed by Vojtěch Jarník in 1930, and put in practice by Robert Clay Prim in 1957. Edsger Wybe Dijkstra rediscovered it in 1959, and called it Prim's algorithm. The other algorithm is called Kruskal's algorithm, and was pulbished by Joseph Kruskal in 1956. All three algorithms are greedy, and run in polynomial time. 
The fastest minimum spanning tree algorithm to date was developed by Bernard Chazelle. The algorithm is based on the soft heap,
an approximate priority queue.
Its running time is "O"("m" α("m","n")), where "m" is the number of edges, "n" is the number of vertices and α is the classical functional inverse of the Ackermann function. The function α grows extremely slowly, so that for all practical purposes it may be considered a constant no greater than 4; thus Chazelle's algorithm takes very close to linear time. 
What is the fastest possible algorithm for this problem? That is one of the oldest open questions in computer science. There is clearly a linear lower bound, since we must at least examine all the weights. If the edge weights are integers with a bounded bit length, then deterministic algorithms are known with linear running time.
For general weights, there are randomized algorithms whose "expected" running time is linear.
The problem can also be approached in a distributed manner. If each node is considered a computer and no node knows anything except its own connected links, one can still calculate the distributed minimum spanning tree.

WWE European Championship

The WWE European Championship is a former championship for World Wrestling Entertainment. It was first established as the 'WWF European Championship'. The first and longest reigning champion, The British Bulldog became the first Champion after winning a tournament that was held over several shows in Germany, culminating in a finals victory over Owen Hart. When Shawn Michaels won the belt, it made him the first Grand Slam Champion in WWE. Michaels was and still is the only wrestler to have held both the WWF Championship and the European title at the same time. The title was on a brief hiatus in 1999 due to then-champion Shane McMahon's wanting to retire an "undefeated champion". The WWE European Championship was retired in a ladder match on July 22, 2002 when Rob Van Dam put his WWE Intercontinental Championship on the line, along with Jeff Hardy's European Championship in a winner-take-all type match. When RVD won the match he merged the two titles together, and continued to hold the Intercontinental Title. RVD's title reign is not listed in the official European title history on WWE's official website, and therefore he is not credited with being a Eurocontinental Champion, but is mentioned in RVD's profile.

2008-09 NHL season

The 2008-09 NHL season was the 91st season of the National Hockey League. It was the first season since before to the 2004-05 lockout in which every team played each other at least once during the season, following three seasons where teams only played against two divisions in the other conference (one division at home and one on the road.) It began on October 4, with the regular season ending on April 12. The Stanley Cup playoffs ended on June 12, with the Pittsburgh Penguins taking the championship. The Montreal Canadiens hosted the 57th NHL All-Star Game at the Bell Centre on January 25, 2009, part of the Canadiens' 100th season celebration.
"GP = Games Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, OTL = Overtime/Shootout Losses, GF = Goals For, GA = Goals Against, Pts = Points."
In the event of a tie in points in the standings at the end of the season, ties are broken using the following tiebreaking procedures.
The higher ranked team is the one with:
"GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; +/- = Plus/Minus; PIM = Penalty Minutes"
"GP = Games Played; TOI = Time On Ice (minutes); W = Wins; L = Losses; OT = Overtime/Shootout Losses; GA = Goals Against; SO = Shutouts; Sv% = Save Percentage; GAA = Goals Against Average"
After the regular season, the standard of 16 teams qualified for the playoffs. The San Jose Sharks won the Presidents' Trophy for having the best record in the league, at 117 points. Division champions maintain their relative ranking during the entire playoffs while the remaining teams get reseeded below them after each round.
"*Montreal finished with exactly the same record as the Florida Panthers (including number of wins), but garnered more points (the Canadiens with six, the Panthers with three) in the four game season series between them, to earn the 8th spot."
In each round, the highest remaining seed in each conference is matched against the lowest remaining seed. The higher-seeded team is awarded home ice advantage. In the Stanley Cup Finals, home ice is determined based on regular season points. Each best-of-seven series follows a 2-2-1-1-1 format: the higher-seeded team will play at home for games 1 and 2 (plus 5 and 7 if necessary), and the lower-seeded team will be at home for game 3, 4 and 6 (if necessary).

Wavelet

A Wavelet is mathematical function used to write down a function or signal in terms of other functions that are simpler to study. Many of signal processing tasks can be seen in terms of a wavelet transform. Informally speaking, the signal can be seen under the lens with a magnification given by the scale of the wavelet. In doing so, we can only see just the information that is determined by the shape of the used wavelet.
English term "wavelet" was introduced in the early 1980s by French physicists Jean Morlet and Alex Grossman.
They used French word "ondelette" (which means "small wave").
Afterwards, this word was transferred to English by translating "onde" into "wave" giving "wavelet".
Wavelet is (complex) function from the Hilbert space formula_1. For practical applications it should satisfy following conditions.
It must have finite energy.
It must satisfy admissibility condition.
Zero mean condition implies from admissibility condition.
Function formula_5 is called mother wavelet. Its translated (shifted) and dilated (scaled) normalized versions are defined as following.
Original mother wavelet has parameters formula_9 and formula_10. Translation is described by formula_11 parameter and dilatation by formula_12 parameter.

Princely state

A princely state (also called a native state or Indian state) was a state within the former British Indian Empire where a native Indian prince held rule on behalf of the British rather than them holding direct control over the state. In reality the British still controlled the state as they had control over the local ruler. Such states could not have relations with other states without British approval. 
The rulers of these states held various titles: e.g. raja (a Hindu ruling prince); maharaja (a greater Hindu ruling prince); nawab (a Muslim ruling prince such as the Nawab of Bhopal); nizam, the title of the Nizam of Hyderabad. Only 21 of the 565 princely states existing in 1947 had state governments of their own, and only four were large states (Hyderabad (Princely state), Mysore, Kashmir and Jammu, and Baroda). Of these three became part of the dominion of India while the status of Jammu and Kashmir was disputed.

A Wookiee is a fictional race of aliens from the Star Wars series of movies. Their home planet is Kashyyyk. The best known Wookiee character is Chewbacca.
When George Lucas was developing fictional characters for "Star Wars", he named Chewbacca after his dog, Chewbacca. The name "Wookiee" came from an in Lucas's first feature movie, "THX 1138". The line was "I think I ran over a Wookiee back there."
On Kashyyyk wookiees build their houses in mile-high trees. They have long arms and legs so they can climb the trees. Chewbacca is over seven feet tall and over 200 years old. By nature they are gentle and intelligent creatures. When angered they can pull a man's arms out of their s. Wookiees have a great sense of smell. They are fully covered with a thick coat of hair. Wookiees prize loyalty and above all else. 
The Wookiee language is Shyriiwook. Wookiees are capable of understanding English but cannot speak it. In the original Star Wars trilogy Chewbacca showed he could understand humans. His human partner, Han Solo, also shows knowledge of Shyriiwook. In the Star Wars expanded universe books, Chewbacca builds a miniature translator droid ("Em Teedee") for his nephew Lowbacca. When Lowbacca begins training as a Jedi the droid helped him communicate with his fellow students.

Epistulae morales ad Lucillium

The Epistulae morales ad Lucilium (in English "Moral Letters to Lucilius") is the name for 124 letters Seneca the Younger wrote when he was old. All letters start "Seneca Lucilio suo salutem" (Seneca greets his Lucilius) and with "Vale" (Farewell). In the letters, Seneca gives Lucilius tips on how to become a better Stoic. Lucilius was the Governor of Sicily at the time, but he is only known through Seneca's writings. The letters treat different subjects, amongst others "On Noise" or "Asthma". Other letters are about "the influence of the masses" and "how to deal with one's slaves". Although they deal with Seneca's eclectic form of Stoic philosophy, they also give valuable insights into the daily life in ancient Rome.
The tag "Vita sine litteris mors" ('Life without learning [is] death') is adapted from "Epistle" 82 (originally "Otium sine litteris mors", 'Leisure without learning [is] death') and is the motto of Derby School and Derby Grammar School in England, Adelphi University, New York, and Manning's High School, Jamaica.

<doc id="208163" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=208163" title="Trouble (Coldplay song)">
Trouble (Coldplay song)

"Trouble" is a song recorded by British alternative rock band Coldplay. It was composed for their first album, "Parachutes". The band wrote the song and produced it with British record producer Ken Nelson. The word "trouble" is repeated many times in the lyrics of the song.
The song was released on 26 October 2000 as a single. It was the third single of the album. It reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart. This made it the band's second Top 10 single in the country. "Trouble" did not chart on the main singles chart in the United States. But the music press said it was almost as successful as "Yellow". "Yellow" was the single released before "Trouble". Two different music videos for the single were released.
Chris Martin, the vocalist of Coldplay said that inspiration for writing "Trouble" came from his own behaviour. Martin said that there were "some bad things going in our band ... the song is about behaving badly towards somebody you really love and I was certainly doing that to some members of the band." The four members of Coldplay are credited as the co-writers of "Trouble". But, it was based on Martin's idea.
British record producer Ken Nelson and the band produced "Trouble" for their first album, "Parachutes". The song was recorded four times before the band got the recording they liked most. The band decided that the first three versions were not "working". The last take was recorded into Pro Tools with a shaker. This was done to provide the rhythm to the track. For the backing track, Will Champion played the drums and Martin played the piano. It was recorded in a little wooden room. Guy Berryman recorded the bass and then guitarist Jonny Buckland added the guitar section. In recording the piano section of the track, the band used two microphones. Nelson, who wanted to keep the song simple, chose the microphone which had a fuller sound for the mixing.
"Trouble" was mixed in New York by American mix engineer Michael Brauer. The first mixed version was sent back to the band and Nelson. However, it was not as good as they wanted and had to be mixed again. Nelson found some problems in the version. In spite of this, he did not blame Brauer because he was not present during the mixing. This was because they were recording the album at that time.
Like in the song "Yellow", in this song the word trouble is used many times. The song's lyrics have "softer emotional themes". This includes apologies and unrequited love, and longing.
The song has a minimalistic approach. The song is mainly built around a piano. It has a snare drum in the background. The sound of the drum was mixed very low. The snare drum cannot be heard when the guitar is played. The song has a tempo of 70 beats per minute. Martin's vocal range in the song is from F to A, the highest note being sung using his falsetto voice.
"Trouble" was released on 26 October 2000 in the United Kingdom, and on 18 December 2001 in the United States. It was the third single of "Parachutes". A limited edition CD of the single was released. It had a remix of the songs "Yellow" and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas". Only 1,000 copies were made. It was given only to fans and journalists.
Coldplay did not accept many offers to use "Trouble" for advertisements. In 2004, the band rejected an offer from Diet Coke and Gap to use the song. The offer was worth many million Euros. American actor Sylvester Stallone wanted to use the song for the soundtrack of his 2001 film "Driven". But the band declined.
"Trouble" was a commercial success. It reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart. This made it the band's second Top 10 single in the UK after "Yellow". "Trouble" was successful because the previous singles did very well. Also, the album, "Parachutes" was very successful in the United Kingdom. The British band Lost Witness made a remixed version of the song. It was released and was successful.
In the United States, the single's chart performance was almost as good as "Yellow"s. It reached number 23 on the "Billboard" Adult Top 40 and 28 on the "Billboard" Modern Rock Tracks. Martin has said the single had saved them from being a "one-hit wonder" band. The band thought it was not a "great single". They felt it would not do well in the United States.
The original European version of the music video for "Trouble" was directed by British director Sophie Muller. The video was shot in a Newhall, California ranch. Its theme was the Wild West.
The music video also had a U.S. version. This was directed by Tim Hope who won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction in 2002 for the video. It was also nominated for "Breakthrough Video". The video is similar to "Don't Panic".

Trichomes are structures on a plant's leaves. They look like tiny hairs sticking out from the surface of the leaf.
Trichomes are made of living cells, which can look very different. Some trichomes have one long cell. Other trichomes are a long chain of cells. They may have branches which make them look like a star. 
Trichomes help to shade the leaf from the sun. They block too much wind from moving across the leaf surface. This stops too much water from leaving the leaf. Animals might not eat leaves with trichomes because they do not like the taste.
Glandular trichomes have chemicals in them. They break when the leaf is touched, and then the chemicals come out.

The club is part of the Hapoel sport organisation, which is connected with the Histadrut trade union. Till independence of Israel in 1948 the club often won the Palestine League (5 titles). After the independence Hapoel joined the Israeli League. 1988/1989 they were relegated to the second league for the first time of their existence. Next year they came back. Since 1948 the won 8 national titels. At all the won 13 national titles and 13 State Cups. The bigest success in international football was the victory in the first Asian Club Championship in 1967 and the UEFA Championsleague group stage in 2011.
"As of July 2011"
Only up to five non-Israeli nationals can be in an Israeli club squad. Those with Jewish ancestry, married to an Israeli or who have played in Israel for an extended period of time can however claim a passport or permanent residency which would allow them to play with Israeli status.

Quantum computer

A quantum computer is a model of how to build a computer. The idea is that quantum computers can use certain phenomena from quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. The basic principle behind quantum computation is that quantum properties can be used to represent data and perform operations on it. A theoretical model is the quantum Turing machine, also known as the universal quantum computer.
The idea of quantum computing is still very new. Experiments have been done. In these, a very small number of operations were done on qubits (quantum bit). Both practical and theoretical research continues with interest, and many national government and military funding agencies support quantum computing research to develop quantum computers for both civilian and military purposes, such as cryptanalysis.
Today's computers, called "classical" computers, store information in binary; each bit is either on or off. Quantum computation use qubits, which, in addition to being possibly on or off, can be both on and off, which is a way of describing superposition, until a measurement is made. The state of a piece of data on a normal computer is known with certainty, but quantum computation uses probabilities. Only very simple quantum computers have been built, although larger designs have been invented. Quantum computation uses a special type of physics, quantum physics.
If large-scale quantum computers can be built, they will be able to solve some problems much more quickly than any computer that exists today (such as Shor's algorithm). Quantum computers are different from other computers such as DNA computers and traditional computers based on transistors. Some computing architectures such as optical computers may use classical superposition of electromagnetic waves. Without quantum mechanical resources such as entanglement, people think that an exponential advantage over classical computers is not possible. Quantum computers cannot perform functions that are not theoretically computable by classical computers, in other words they do not alter the Church-Turing thesis. They would, however, be able to do many things much more quickly and efficiently.

Wavelet transform

The wavelet transform is a time-frequency representation of a signal. For example, we use it for noise reduction, feature extraction or signal compression.
Wavelet transform of continuous signal is defined as
where
In case of formula_6 and formula_7, where formula_8, formula_9 and formula_10 and formula_11 are integer constants, the wavelet transform is called discrete wavelet transform (of continuous signal).
In case of formula_12 and formula_13, where formula_14, the discrete wavelet transform is called dyadic. It is defined as
where
It is possible to rewrite dyadic discrete wavelet transform as
where formula_20 is impulse characteristic of continuous filter which is identical to formula_21 for given formula_10.
Analogously, dyadic wavelet transform with discrete time (of discrete signal) is defined as

Quadrature mirror filter

The quadrature mirror filters (QMF) are two filters with frequency characteristics symmetric about formula_1 of sampling frequency (i.e. formula_2). They are used especially in process of orthogonal discrete wavelet transform design.
In notation of Z-transform, we can create the quadrature mirror filter formula_3 to (original) filter formula_4 by substitution formula_5 with formula_6 in the transfer function of formula_4.
By doing it, the transfer characteristic of formula_3 is shifted to formula_4 by formula_11.
Impulse characteristic is therefore
According to the picture above, the signal split and passed into these filters can be downsampled by a factor of two. Nevertheless, original signal can be still reconstructed by using reconstruction filters formula_16 and formula_17. Reconstruction filters are given by time reversal analysis filters.
For orthogonal discrete wavelet transform formula_3 is given by
Impulse characteristic is
Reconstruction filters are still given by same equations.

Neil Aspinall

Neil Aspinall (13 October 1941 - 23 March 2008) was a British music executive. He was the managing director of Apple Corps, a company started by The Beatles. He had earlier served as the band's road manager.
Aspinall was born in Prestatyn, North Wales and grew up in Liverpool, England. He was an Accountancy student and lived with the Best family, renting a room in their house. Eldest son Pete Best was a drummer who played for the Beatles. Aspinall owned a van, and began driving the band to their shows, and setting up equipment. In time, they began to pay him for this, and he gave up his studies to be their official road manager. 
During 1962 the Beatles changed drummers when Ringo Starr joined, and Pete Best was let go. Aspinall offered to quit also, but he was persuaded to keep working for the Beatles. (He kept a connection to the Best family, having a son, Roag, with Mona Best.) Aspinall was joined by another man, Mal Evans, who shared his job duties.
Over time, other people helped with setting up and breaking down the Beatles' instruments and equipment, but Aspinall and Evans still supervised them. They also did other jobs, like shopping for the band, delivering important messages, and dealing with members of the public who wanted to meet the band. Some of their lesser-known jobs were choosing female audience members at Beatles concerts to visit the band backstage, and signing Beatles autographs on photographs. (The demand for autographs was too great for the Beatles themselves to meet practically.)
When the Beatles stopped giving concerts, they put time into forming their own company, which became Apple Corps. Aspinall and Evans were both directors at Apple, and personal assistants to the Beatles. None of the band's inner circle knew how to run a large company, and Apple got into financial trouble. Allen Klein and Lee Eastman (Paul McCartney's father-in-law) took over running Apple, and Evans was fired. Aspinall was also supposed to be fired, but the Beatles themselves insisted he be kept on.
After the Beatles disbanded, Apple's business decreased, Klein and Eastman moved on, and Apple was reorganized. Aspinall alone was able to handle most of Apple's ongoing business, which was mostly licensing Beatles-related products, and future issues of Beatles music. He kept working for the band until shortly before his death.
Aspinall's last tasks for Apple included handling a lawsuit against Apple Inc. over iTunes, and supervising a new recording of the whole Beatles music catalogue. Aspinall died of lung cancer in New York City in 2008.

Jean Balukas

Jean Balukas (born June 28, 1959) is an American pool player from Brooklyn, New York. During the 1970s and 1980s, many people thought Balukas was the greatest female player ever. Some people described her as a leader and "a child prodigy, a loner who rebelled against dress codes for women—the pool equivalent of Billie Jean King". Balukas was named Billiard Congress of America (BCA) Player of the Year five times. She was the youngest person given an entry in the BCA Hall of Fame. She is only the second woman given that honor. In 1999, Balukas was ranked fifteenth on "Billiard Digest's" Fifty Greatest Players of the 20 Century.
Balukas was thought of as a rare young talent. She first earned some fame when she was six years old by appearing in a pool playing event held at New York City's Grand Central Station. She later appeared many times on television, such as on CBS's popular evening television show, "I've Got a Secret". She was nine years old when she placed 5th in the 1969 U.S. Open Straight Pool Championship. She placed 4th and 3rd in the next two U.S. Opens. From that early start, Balukas dominated women's professional pool during the 1970s and 1980s.
Balukas won the U.S. Open seven years in a row, from 1972 through 1978. She won six world championship titles. She had over 100 professional competition first place finishes; 38 of those wins were in major events. She had a streak of 16 first place finishes in women's professional tournaments. Balukas was also the only woman to compete equally with men in professional play in her era. She quit the sport in 1988 because of a dispute that happened in a match at the World Open Nine-ball Championship that year.
Jean Balukas's father, Albert Balukas, and his business partner, Frank McGown, owned a forty-eight-table pool hall, named the Ovington Lounge, in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, New York. Balukas began playing pool when she four years old. She did not play at her father's pool room. Her first play was on a 4½ by 9 foot pool table in the basement of her childhood home. Her parents bought the table to keep her four brothers out of local pool rooms.
Balukas played with a cue stick that had ivory details. It was made just for her in 1965 by a cue stick maker, George Balabushka. When she was five and six years old she would practice a game called straight pool to 50 points after family dinners. Her father supported her play.
In 1966, McGown held a public billiards exhibition at New York City's Grand Central Terminal. With her parents' permission, he brought along the six-year-old Balukas. Balukas participated in the exhibition. This gained Balukas media attention. Later in 1966, Balukas appeared on a television show called "Wonderama". Balukas and her younger sister Laura also appeared on CBS's television show "I've Got a Secret" later that year.
In 1967, Balukas was in an exhibition match at a pool hall called the Carom Club, located Manhattan. In advertisements for the match, Balukas was described as "the Little Princess of Pocket Billiards". A reporter described her at the match as "a little girl with honey-blond hair...wearing a short yellow dress and green leotards...who resembles a young Shirley Temple". She beat her adult opponent, Roland DeMarco, with a final score of 50 to 42. 
In 1969, at the age of nine, she competed in her first Billiard Congress of America U.S. Open Straight Pool Championship. Balukas placed 5th in the competition. All her opponents were adults. In the next two U.S. Opens, in 1970 and 1971, she placed 4th and 3rd, respectively. By that time, Balukas had appeared on other television programs with a number of billiard stars and other celebrities.
On August 18, 1972, when she was thirteen years old, Balukas won the women's side of the U.S. Open Straight Pool Championship. For the win she beat five time champion Dorothy Wise. The prize was $1,500. Balukas was the U.S Open's youngest winner ever and by a large number of years. She also beat in the finals, Madelyn Whitlow of Detroit, Michigan, with a score of 75 to 32 in 44 innings (turns at the table). Reporting on the competition, "The New York Times" described her as a strong player "throughout the tournament ... as she defeated six opponents with precision shooting and [almost perfect] strategy". 
In 1973, at fourteen, Balukas successfully defended her straight pool U.S. Open title. She beat runner-up Donna Ries, a psychologist from Kansas City, Missouri, with a final score of 75 to 72 in 42 innings. In her longest turn, she sank 26 balls in a row and won $2,000 for first place. Earlier in the tournament she beat Mieko Harada, a housewife from Kyoto, Japan. Baluka's score was much higher than Harada's: 75 to 1 in 20 innings and sank 25 balls in a row. In the 1974 U.S. Open held at the Sheraton Hotel in Chicago, Balukas defended her title, again beating out Harada, but by a much closer score: 100 to 99. This was Balukas's third U.S. Open title in a row, at the young age of fifteen. The close scores at the end of the match were similar to the results on the men's side, where Joe Balsis defeated Jim Rempe 200 to 199. 
In 1975, Balukas beat Ries again in the U.S. Open semi-finals with a score of 75 to 15 in 15 innings. She also beat Gail Breedlove of Ames, Iowa, 75 to 19. She then again played and beat Harada in the finals, winning $3,000 with a score of 100 to 63 in 39 innings. In her longest turn, she sank 23 balls. In 1976, then 17, Balukas took her fifth U.S. Open title in a row, beating Gloria Walker of Cheyney, Pennsylvania 75 to 46 in 39 innings and winning a $1,700 prize. Balukas would win the next two U.S. Open straight pool championships for a total of seven wins in a row. Her streak of wins ended after 1978 because the U.S. Open itself was canceled, not because she was beaten. 
Balukas was not only talented at pool but also good at other sports. From age sixteen to eighteen, ABC-TV asked her to be on a show called "Superstars". This event happened in Rotonda West, Florida. Top athletes from one sport competed in a different sports that they did not usually compete in. In her first appearance in 1976, while a junior in high school, Balukas placed second with 192 points. She won titles in tennis and bowling. The winner that year was speed skater Anne Henning. Other competitors included: diver Micki King; tennis and golf pro Althea Gibson; skier Kiki Cutter; runner Wyomia Tyus; and tennis champion Martina Navratilova. The second place win was both good and bad for Balukas. She won $13,100 prize money, so she lost amateur standing. Afterwards, she was banned from competing in high school sports. Also, she was not allowed to get a college athletic scholarship.
Balukas has won many other pool titles, including six at the World Open Pocket Billiard Championships. At her first win in that tournament, held at a convention hall in Asbury Park, New Jersey on August 14, 1977, she was described as "the 18-year-old prodigy from Brooklyn". There, she again beat Gloria Walker with a score of 100 to 57, and earned a $1,001 prize. Balukas has won more U.S. Opens than any other player, male or female. The closest male is Steve Mizerak with four wins to Balukas's seven. Her ball average over the seven U.S. Opens was far better than was her opponents'. Balukas averaged 3.44 in 1972 with the next best, Gloria Walker, having an average of 2.37. In 1975 she averaged 4.05, while no other player averaged even 3.
By the late 1960s, Balukas was playing in exhibition matches with top male players. For example, she played with Willie Mosconi and Irving Crane who were together considered between 1941 and 1956 the "best in the world, flat out". In 1975, she again played Willie Mosconi on CBS's "Challenge of the Sexes", playing in games of eight-ball and nine-ball. For the exhibition, the rules were changed to allow Balukas to have an advantage (a practice called "handicapping"). Specifically, Balukas always took the first shot. Then, she also took the next shot, even if she did not put a ball in a pocket on the first shot. Balukas beat Mosconi at both games. She would later play "Battle of the Sexes" matches on television with Rudolph Wanderone (also known as Minnesota Fats) in 1977, Ray Martin in 1979, and with Steve Mizerak in 1986.
On August 6, 1978, Balukas became the first women to qualify to play in the men's side of the World Open Pocket Billiards Championship. This meant that Balukas would be competing in both the women's and men's sides of the tournament. The tournament was to be held on August 12 of that year at the Biltmore Hotel in New York City. 
Balukas played against men in several other competitions. These included at least one first shown on TV on March 25, 1979, between her and men's champion Ray Martin. The match was described on the television schedule as part of a "Challenge of the Sexes". Other male-female matchups in the series were between golfers Nancy Lopez and Andy North and co-ed participants in a skateboarding challenge match. During 1980, Balukas again competed in the men's side of the World Open Pocket Billiards championship. That year it was played at New York City's Roosevelt Hotel. She was beaten in the second round by Steve Mizerak with a score of 150 to 93. Her final in the tournament was 22nd. At the end, 42 men were behind her. She also played on the women's side and was the champion. She beat Billie Billings, also from Brooklyn, with a score of 100 to 75.
Balukas was entered in both the men's and women's divisions of the 1987 B.C. Classic, a nine-ball competition. After controversy, she competed only on the men's side. There, she beat Keith McCready 11 to 3. At that time McCready was the 17th-ranked male player by money list. Balukas finished the tournament by tying for 9th place.
In August 1987, at the B.C. Classic held at a Holiday Inn in Binghamton, New York, Balukas was scheduled to play in the men's and women's tournaments. After arriving, she found out that for the nighttime matches, she would be required to wear formal clothing. However, she did not have suitable clothing with her. The men's side had no similar dress code. Thus, Balukas did not buy clothes to follow the rule because she thought it was unfair. 
The women held a vote on whether Balukas should be allowed to play. The vote resulted in Balukas being banned from the women's tournament. Some people said that the real reason other players voted her out was because they would have a better chance of winning the first place USD $5,000 prize if Balukas did not play. Balukas did not think so. Balukas did compete on the men's side, tying for ninth place.
Soon after the dress code issue was reported on, the president of the Women's Professional Billiard Association (WPBA), Belinda Bearden, sent a letter to "The New York Times". Bearden wrote that the facts were different than reported. The WPBA stated the dress code was decided by the women players for themselves. They made the rules to improve the image of women's pool and to attract a larger audience and more press to the sport. They said that Balukas was the only woman at the event who was not willing to follow the rule. They also explained that Balukas first left from the women's division. They said that she came back to play after the list of who would play who was already completed. Another vote on whether she could play went 8–7 in Balukas' favor. However, after they asked a player who was absent from the first vote, Balukas withdrew from the women's division of the competition.
In 1988, Balukas was playing another professional player named Robin Bell the Brunswick-sponsored World Open Nine-ball Championship. The tournament was held at Caesars Palace (a casino and hotel) in Las Vegas, Nevada and shown on television. Bell was Balukas's best friend on the women's tour. She had never beaten Balukas before. However, Bell had been playing very strongly in the tournament. The terms of the match were that the winner would be whoever won nine games first. In the game of nine ball, there is a way to win the game very quickly. The game is over and the first player wins if they put the 9 ball in a pocket when they take the first shot. Early in the match the score was 2 games to 3, with Bell winning. Then, Bell sank the 9 ball on the first shot two games in a row, so she won both games. That made the score 5 to 2 very quickly without having to play a complete game. Bell avoided having to match skill with Balukas on each turn.
All television match players wore small microphones so that their words and the sounds of play could be heard by the audience. Balukas quietly said to herself that Bell had gotten lucky. The microphone let others hear what Balukas said. The referee spoke to Balukas and told her not to continue talking about Bell. They continued playing. Balukas won the match with a final score of 9 to 5. According to an interview with Balukas by "New York Woman" magazine in 1991, Balukas's exact words were "Some world championship... beat me with skill, not luck". Despite Bell and Balukas's friendship, after the match Bell made a formal to the WPBA about the incident. The WPBA's board of directors fined Balukas $200 for unsportsmanlike conduct.
Balukas was angry about the fine. She did not pay it. She turned down offers by others to pay the fine for her. Balukas explained that "It wasn’t the $200... [Women] pool players, who were ranked three and six and five, were the ones who decided I should be fined. I felt it should have been done by an outside panel, not by my competitors". The sides were deadlocked. Balukas to pay and the WPBA refused to cancel the fine. They would not allow Balukas to play again until she paid. "Just because she was our premier player does not mean she was above the rules", said Vicki Paski in 1992, then president of the WPBA. Another professional named Loree Jon Jones was also interviewed. Her feelings were more mixed: "Her not playing is, I guess, sad", but she also said that without Balukas playing, "we've all learned how to win".
Balukas had faced other problems before she stopped competing. When she had tried to compete against men as the only woman she heard insults from some men. For example, one said "I’m gonna put on a dress and go play with the women". Balukas heard many complaints from the men upon her entry to a Chicago tournament in 1988. They said it was not fair that she got to play on both the men's and women's side, when the men could only play on their own side. She agreed not to play. However, after she traveled to the tournament she learned she had been tricked: "I found out that the first- and second-place winners in the women’s event were going to be invited to play in the men’s event. I was stabbed in the back".
Balukas also admits having been under great pressure, much of it that she placed on herself. After she reached the very top of her profession, "That's when I started getting nervous... that’s when I started putting a lot of pressure on myself". "Playing against the men, I learned to lose... but [losing] hurt with the women because I was expected to win all the time". Balukas later said that leaving the sport was a combination of many things, including: stress, fatigue, frustration, and anger at the professional pool industry. She said, "You know, you're going to fine me? Well, see you later. That was my excuse to finally say I need a break".
After leaving the sport, Balukas returned to Bay Ridge. She took over management of her family's pool hall, Hall of Fame Billiards on Ovington Avenue in Brooklyn. She says "I'm enjoying my life immensely... I have moved on". In summing up these events in a 1992 article, "The New York Times" stated, "So America's greatest woman pool player competes only for the odd soda. If you're feeling lucky, drop by her poolroom...If you're thirsty...go elsewhere".
In 1975, when she was fifteen years old, Balukas was already described as the "best female pool player in the world". Announcers had stopped calling Balukas "the Little Princess", but introduced her to audiences as "the Queen". By that time she had won the World Straight Pool Championship women's division eight of the last nine years. During those same years, she also won sixteen women's professional tournaments. She had been named the Billiard Congress of America Player of the Year five times. In 1985, Balukas became the second woman (after Dorothy Wise) to enter the BCA Hall of Fame. She was the youngest person ever to receive the honor, at just under 27 years of age. In 1999, Balukas was ranked number fifteen on "Billiard Digest's" Fifty Greatest Players of the Century.

New York State Route 308

New York State Route 308 (NY 308, Route 308) is a short road in Dutchess County, New York. The highway is long. It goes through mostly rural areas, and is usually used as a shortcut from U.S. Route 9 (US 9) to New York State Route 9G. The road passes several landmarks along its path. The road began its history in about 1685, when a group of Native Americans built the Sepasco Trail. This trail went from the Hudson River to Lake Sepasco, and followed the same path that currently exists as Route 308. The trail was there until 1802, when part of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike was built over it. Route 308 was officially formed in 1930.
Part of NY 308 is in the Rhinebeck Village Historic District, which is a area that has 272 historical buildings. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. A well-known attraction is the Beekman Arms Inn, which is located at the corner of NY 308 and US 9. The inn was started in 1776, and says it is one of the oldest inns within the United States.
The road begins at US 9 in the village of Rhinebeck, which is above sea level. To the south of here is a park, a small lake, and a cemetery. At this point, the Dutchess County Fairgrounds are north of Route 308. The highway goes to the east, and is called East Market Street. It soon leaves Rhinebeck, while it runs next to a small creek sometimes known as the Landsman Kill.
The road intersects with County Route 101 and then turns to the north. It also intersects with Route 9G before it turns to the east into a rural area. In this area, Route 308 carries about 6,400 vehicles each day. There are many small lakes around the road as it intersects with County Route 52 and turns to the northeast. NY 308 then travels west of Sepasco Lake before turning east again. It ends at NY 199 in the town of Milan.
The earliest people that lived in northern Dutchess County were the Mohicans. They were a Native American nation that came to the area about 3,000 years ago. There were around 8,000 Mohicans during the time they first saw the Europeans. However, there were only 800 after the American Revolution. Artifacts were found along the shore of Lake Sepasco, which is a small lake near NY 308. The artifacts included very old arrowheads, and are now being shown at a local museum. 
A smaller group of these Native Americans were known as the Sepasco Indians. This name was used for Native Americans in the Sepasco area, which is now known as Rhinebeck. The word "Sepasco" probably came from the tribe's word for "little river" or "stream", which is "sepuus". After the Civil War, only a few of the Sepasco were left. The last Sepasco Indian died in 1867 in a hut near Lake Sepasco. By 1685, a trail known as the Sepasco Trail was formed by the Sepasco people. This trail started at the Hudson River and went east through the village of Rhinebeck. It ended at Lake Sepasco. Part of the trail from Rhinebeck to Lake Sepasco follows about the same path that is today taken by Route 308.
The trail was there until 1802, when a turnpike, a type of road, was built over it "for improving and making a road from the west line of the Town of Salisbury in the State of Connecticut to the Susquehannah River at or near the Town of Jericho". The part of the new turnpike east of the Hudson River was sometimes known as the "Ulster and Salisbury Turnpike". A plaque was placed in November 1922 at the Beekman Arms Inn. The sign marked the crossing of the Kings Highway (now called US 9) and the Ulster and Salisbury Turnpike.
NY 308 itself was officially made during 1930. The path of the road was changed a bit in the 1960s.

Grand Central Terminal

Grand Central Terminal (GCT) — often popularly (and incorrectly) called Grand Central Station or simply Grand Central — is a terminal station at 42nd Street and Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan in New York City. Built by and named for the New York Central Railroad in the heyday of American long-distance passenger trains, it is the largest train station in the world by number of railway platforms: 44, with 67 tracks along them. They are on two levels, both below ground, with 41 tracks on the upper level and 26 on the lower. When the Long Island Rail Road's new station, below the existing levels, opens, Grand Central will offer a total of 75 tracks and 48 platforms. The terminal covers an area of 48 acres.
The terminal serves commuters traveling on the Metro-North Railroad to Westchester County, New York, Putnam County, New York, and Dutchess County, New York in New York State, and Fairfield County, Connecticut and New Haven County, Connecticut in the state of Connecticut.
It was built in 1871 and rebuilt in 1913. Although the terminal has been properly called "Grand Central Terminal" since 1913, many people continue to refer to it as "Grand Central Station". Technically, "Grand Central Station" is the name of the nearby post office, and of a New York City subway station at the same location. The 1871 rail station on the site was "Grand Central Depot".

Pedernales, Dominican Republic

Pedernales is a Dominican city and the capital of the Pedernales province, in the southwest of the country close to the border with Haiti.
The name of "Pedernales" was given to the town when it was founded because that was the name of the river that now is the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
"Pedernales" or "silex" ("flint") is the name of a hard mineral that is common in the region.
Before the conquest of the island by European people, some native groups lived around the place where the city of Pedernales is now. But soon those groups disappeared and very few people came to live here because it is a very dry region.
When the French colony of "Saint-Domingue" (present Haiti) was created, the Pedernales river was the southern border between that colony and the Spanish colony of "Santo Domingo" (present Dominican Republic). During those colonial times, some soldiers came here for some time but almost nobody lived here for a long time.
In 1927, the Dominican government brought farmers from other places of the country and made a town for them; the new town was given the name of Pedernales and its first administrator was Sócrates Nolasco who later became a well-known writer.
The town became, in 1938, a municipal district (an administrative division of a municipality in the Dominican Republic) of Enriquillo, province of Barahona.
When the Pedernales province was created in 1957, the town of Pedernales became the capital of the new province.
The municipality had, in , a total population of 14,590: 7,473 men and 7,117 women. The urban population was of the total population.
The only rivers in the municipality, and in the province, are the Pedernales river and its tributary Mulito.
Sierra de Bahoruco ("Bahoruco mountain range") is in the northern half of the municipality; its highest mountain, and the highest mountain of the province, is "Loma del Toro", above sea level, in the limits with the Independencia province.
The municipality has a total area of and has only one municipal district (a subdivision of a municipality): José Francisco Peña Gómez.
The altitude of the city of Pedernales is above sea level.
The municipality of Pedernales has the Independencia Province to the north, the Barahona Province to the east, the municipality of Oviedo to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the south and Haiti to the west. The city is at about from the border with Haiti.
Pedernales has a subtropical steppe/low-latitude semi-arid hot climate (Köppen-Geiger classification: BSh).
The average amount of rainfall for the year in the city is . The month with the most precipitation on average is September with of rainfall, followed by October with .
The driest season is winter. The month with the least rainfall on average is January with an average of followed by February with an average of .
Pedernales is in a hot region; the average temperature for the year is . The warmest month, on average, is August with an average temperature of . The coolest month on average is January, with an average temperature of .
The municipality of Pedernales has only one municipal district:
Because Pedernales is on the border, the trade with Haiti is important. But the main economic activity is farming, mainly on the mountains, where coffee and beans are important products. Potato, cabbage and other vegetables are produced in the Sierra de Bahoruco.
Fishing is also an important activity in the province, mainly close to the Beata Island, where lobster, conch and several kind of fishes are caught.
Tourism is becoming an important economic activity because there are several beautiful beaches with white sand, like "Cabo Rojo" and "Bahía de las Águilas". There are two of the largest national parks of the country: the "Jaragua National Park" and the "Sierra de Bahoruco National Park".
Mining of limestone to send to other countries and for a cement factory is another important economic activity in the municipality.

Heaviside Function

The Heaviside function, "H" is a non-continuous function whose value is zero for negative argument and one for positive argument.
The function is used in the mathematics of control theory to represent a signal that switches on at a specified time and stays switched on indefinitely. It was named after the Englishman Oliver Heaviside.
The Heaviside function is the integral of the Dirac delta function: "H"′ = "δ". This is sometimes written as
We can also define an alternative form of the Heaviside step function as a function of a discrete variable "n":
where "n" is an integer.
Or
The discrete-time unit impulse is the first difference of the discrete-time step
This function is the cumulative summation of the Kronecker delta:

Often an integral representation of the Heaviside step function is useful:
The value of the function at 0 can be defined as "H"(0) = 0, "H"(0) = ½ or "H"(0) = 1.

Descriptive statistics is a branch of statistics. Its aim is to summarize a set of statistical data. The data are usually taken by sampling a population. To picture the way the data are distributed, a histogram may be drawn. The data may be summarized by computing some characterising values, like the "center" of the dat, and the "spread". In some cases the different items of data will be grouped and the groups will be described, in some way.

<doc id="208412" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=208412" title="Flynn effect">
Flynn effect

There is a rise in average IQ scores since the beginning of measurements. It is called the Flynn effect. The rise in most industrialized countries is about three IQ points per decade. James R. Flynn described this phenomenon in 1984.
Others supported the claims. They found the rise was mostly due to the test scores of those who scored an IQ below 100. The number of those who were classified as "mentally handicapped" reduced from year to year. In contrast, the scores of those who got more than 100 did not seem to be affected.
IQ tests are re-normalized every so often to hold the average score for an age group at 100. This gave a first hint to Flynn that the IQ was changing over time. The revised versions are standardized on new samples and scored with respect to those samples only. The only way to compare the difficulty of two versions is to have a group of people take both tests. This confirms IQ gains over time.
The average rate of rise seems to be around three IQ points per decade. Today, children go to school for a longer time. They have also become more familiar with testing. It might therefore be expected that the biggest gains occur with school-related content, such as vocabulary, arithmetic or general information. Just the opposite is the case: abilities such as these have had small gains and occasional declines over the years. The largest changes appear on general intelligence factor loaded (g-loaded) tests such as Raven's Progressive Matrices, instead. For example, Dutch soldiers gained 21 points in only 30 years, or 7 points per decade, between 1952 and 1982.
Some studies focused on the distribution of scores have found that the Flynn effect mainly occurs with lower scores. However, Raven (2000) found that a lot of data must be re-interpreted with respect to the date of birth. Previously, this data had been interpreted to show that many abilities decrease when people get older. This data must now be interpreted to show that many abilities had in fact increased dramatically, as Flynn predicted. On many tests this occurs at all levels of ability. Two large samples of Spanish children were assessed with a 30-year gap. Comparison of the IQ distributions indicated that 
Some scientists believe these changes are very big. One of them is Ulric Neisser. In 1995 he was the head of a task force of the American Psychological Association, charged with writing a statement on where intelligence research was. He estimates that if American children of 1932 could take an IQ test normed in 1997 their average IQ would have been only about 80. In other words, half of the children in 1932 would be classified as having borderline mental retardation or worse in 1997. Looking at Ravens, Neisser estimates that if you extrapolate beyond the data, which shows a 21 point gain between 1952 and 1982, an even larger gain of 35 IQ points can be argued. Arthur Jensen warns that extrapolating beyond the data leads to results such as an IQ of minus 1000 for Aristotle (even assuming he would have scored 200 in his day).
Most of the time, the effect is associated with IQ rises. A similar effect has been found with increases in semantic and episodic memory.

<doc id="208418" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=208418" title="Billy Graham">
Billy Graham

William Franklin Graham, Jr. (born November 7, 1918), better known as Billy Graham, is an American Evangelical Christian minister and evangelist. He is a member of the Southern Baptist Convention. He has been a spiritual advisor to several U.S. presidents. Graham has preached in person to more people than anyone else who has ever lived. Until 2002, Graham's lifetime audience with radio and television broadcast was more than two billion people. Graham has met every United States President since Harry S. Truman. He has received many honors including the Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Billy Graham was born on a dairy farm near Charlotte, North Carolina. His mother and father Morrow Coffey and William Franklin Graham managed the farm. They were devout Christians and Graham's mother had a big influence on his faith. In 1933 Graham's father forced Graham and his sister Catherine to drink beer until they vomited. This made them hate alcohol for the rest of their lives. The Billy Graham Center says Graham was converted in 1934 during a revival meeting in Charlotte led by local evangelist Mordecai Ham. However, he did not become a member of a local youth group because he was "too worldly". After graduating from Sharon High School in May 1936 Graham went to Bob Jones College (now called Bob Jones University).
In his first year of college, he found both the schoolwork and rules too hard. He almost had to leave school, but Bob Jones, Sr., the founder of the college, said that in doing that, he would throw his life away. He told Graham, "At best, all you could amount to would be a poor country Baptist preacher somewhere out in the sticks... You have a voice that pulls. God can use that voice of yours. He can use it mightily."
While he was at college, Graham would often take a canoe to a little island in the river. On that island he would preach to the birds, alligators, and cypress stumps. In 1937, Graham transferred to the Florida Bible Institute (now Trinity College of Florida) where the Florida College in Temple Terrace, Florida now stands. Graham later transferred to Wheaton College and in 1943, graduated from Wheaton in Illinois with a degree in anthropology. While he was at Wheaton College, Graham decided to take the Bible as the perfect Word of God. He accepted this as truth at the Forest Home Christian camp (now called "Forest Home Ministries"), southeast of the Big Bear area in Southern California. A memorial is there showing where Graham first made this choice.
In 1946, Graham married a girl who was in a class with him, Ruth Bell. Her parents were Presbyterian missionaries in China. Her father, L. Nelson Bell, worked as a surgeon there. When talking about Bell, Graham said "She looked at me and our eyes met and I felt that she was definitely the woman I wanted to marry." Ruth said that he wanted to please God more than any man she had ever met. They married two months after they graduated from college. After marriage, they lived in a log cabin that she had made. Ruth died on June 14, 2007, at age 87. They had five children together: Virginia (Gigi) Graham Foreman; Anne Graham Lotz; Ruth Dienert; Franklin Graham, and Ned Graham. They also have 19 grandchildren and 28 great-grandchildren.
Graham became a Southern Baptist minister in 1939. Then he took over and organized financing of the radio program "Songs in the Night". Afterwards, he made the baritone, George Beverly Shea director of music in his ministry. The program went well, but Graham left it in 1945. He wished to be a chaplain in the armed forces, but after trying to get in, he came down with mumps, so he had to not enlist. After some time, he recovered in Florida. Then he started Youth for Christ with evangelist Charles Templeton. He traveled all through the United States and Europe as an evangelist.
Graham held many revival meetings in Los Angeles in 1949. These revivals are thought to be the time when Graham became a national religious figure. This is because he got help from the powerful newspaper man William Randolph Hearst. Many people believe that Hearst liked Graham for his love of his country. It is also believed that he may have thought that Graham could help with his conservative, anti-communist views. Hearst sent a telegram to his newspaper editors reading "Puff Graham" during Billy Graham's late 1949 Los Angeles crusade. Therefore, one could read much more about Graham now in Hearst's newspaper chain and national magazines. That meant that his crusade event could run for eight full weeks — five weeks longer than planned. Henry Luce put Graham on the cover of "Time magazine" in 1954.
Graham had missions in both London and the Madison Square Garden in 1957. The London mission lasted 12 weeks and the New York mission was about 16 weeks. He also led his first crusade in Australia in 1959.
Graham was the president of Northwestern College in Minnesota from 1948 to 1952. He began many organizations, such as the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. He also spoke against racial segregation during the 1960s. Graham did not want to speak to segregated auditoriums. He even once tore down ropes that had been put up to split the audience. Graham paid bail money to get Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. out of jail. That was during the 1960s American Civil Rights Movement. He asked King to join him in the pulpit at the revival meeting at New York City in 1957. During that 16-week tour, he was heard by many people, who came to hear him at Madison Square Garden, Yankee Stadium and the Times Square. Because they became good friends, Graham was one of the few white people King let call him by his birth name "Michael".
During the Cold War, Graham was the first evangelist to speak behind the Iron Curtain. During the Apartheid times, Graham would not go to South Africa until the government let all people sit together. He finally preached his first crusade there in 1973, during which he taught that apartheid was not right.
Graham went to China, where his wife Ruth was born. He also appeared in North Korea in 1992. On September 14, 2001, shortly after the September 11 attacks, Graham led prayer at the Washington National Cathedral. President George W. Bush went to this service. On June 24, 2005, he began what he said would be his last North American crusade. On the weekend of March 11 and March 12, 2006 Billy Graham held the "Festival of Hope". It was held in New Orleans, which was recovering from Hurricane Katrina.
Graham said that he had to retire because of his failing health. He has had Parkinson's disease for about 15 years, as well as many other problems. In August 2005, though weak, he used a walker to go to at the start of his library in Charlotte, North Carolina. On August 18, 2007, Graham, aged 88, was treated for intestinal bleeding.
Billy Graham has preached Christianity to nearly 215 million people in more than 185 countries and territories. Graham has also preached to hundreds of millions more through television, videos, movie, and webcasts. He has been to over 41 evangelistic crusades since 1948. He began this ministry in 1947, and kept doing it until recently. He would often use a big area, such as a stadium, park, or a large street to speak at. Groups of up to 5,000 people would often sing in choir at his meetings. Graham would preach the gospel and then invite people to come forward. In 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 in his Moscow audience came for Salvation upon his request.
In politics, Graham was a member of the Democratic Party, but changed to Republican during the presidency of his friend Richard Nixon. He is no party member, because he says that Jesus did not have a political party. Though he does not support people running on politics in general, he has given his support in some cases over the years.
Graham has met every United States President since Harry Truman. He became close friends with Vice-President Richard Nixon while on a golf course. Dwight D. Eisenhower asked to see Graham while on his deathbed. Graham also worked with Lyndon B. Johnson, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, the Bush family, and Barack Obama when he visited Rev. Graham at his home in Montreat, North Carolina where they “had a private prayer.”
Graham played golf with John F. Kennedy, even though Kennedy was a Roman Catholic. Graham spent the last night of Johnson's presidency in the White House. He was also there for the first night of Nixon's. Nixon appeared at one of Graham's revivals in East Tennessee in 1970. It had one of the biggest crowds ever to gather in Tennessee. However, their friendship got weaker because Graham did not approve of Nixon's post-Watergate behavior. They became better friends again. Graham said at that time, "I'm out of politics."
When Graham went to the hospital in 1976, three Presidents called in one day to wish him well: former President Nixon, President Ford, and President-Elect Carter. He was at the start of Reagan's presidency, and gave the speech at George H.W. Bush's presidency. Bill Clinton went to one of Graham's New York revivals in 2005. He also said that he had gone to Graham's revival as a boy in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1959.
Graham has spoken at many funerals over the years, but he was unable to do Reagan's on June 11, 2004, because of recent hip surgery. Graham had been Reagan's first choice. Bad health also kept Graham from doing the funeral of President Gerald R. Ford in Washington D.C., on January 2, 2007.
Graham spoke against communism. He was in favor of the U.S. Cold War policy, including the Vietnam War. However, in a 1999 speech, he talked about his relationship with the late North Korean dictator Kim Il-Sung. He said that he was a "different kind of communist" and "one of the great fighters for freedom in his country against the Japanese." Graham went on to say that even though he had never met Kim's son and former North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il, he had "exchanged gifts with him." Graham has given a globe covered with doves to the "North Korean Friendship Museum".
In 1994, the people read in the diaries of H. R. Haldeman that Graham had talked with President Nixon about "Jewish domination of the media". (H. R. Haldeman worked with Richard Nixon at the White House). Because what Haldeman had written was different from things that Graham usually said in public, most Jewish groups did not really believe it. Graham released a statement that he never spoke "publicly or privately about the Jewish people, including conversations with President Nixon, except in the most positive terms." He said, "Those are not my words." In 2002, however, "Richard Nixon tapes" showed that Graham had talked about it, in the 1970s. This was like Haldeman had written. On the tapes, Graham agreed with Nixon that Jews had control over the American media. He called it a "stranglehold" in 1972. Graham said "This stranglehold has got to be broken or the country's going down the drain." When the videotapes were released, Graham said he was sorry for his remarks, saying, "although I have no memory of the occasion, I deeply regret comments I apparently made ... They do not reflect my views, and I sincerely apologize for any offense caused by the remarks." He also said that "If it wasn't on tape, I would not have believed it. I guess I was trying to please... I went to a meeting with Jewish leaders and I told them I would crawl to them to ask their forgiveness."
Between 1950 and 1990, Graham appeared many times on "Gallup's list of most admired people". The United States Postal Service has said that he is one of the few Americans, along with the current President, who can get mail that simply says his name and country: "Billy Graham, America". He has received the "Congressional Gold Medal" from the United States Congress and the "Presidential Medal of Freedom" from Reagan, America's highest civilian honors. President Bill Clinton and former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole gave Graham the "Congressional Gold Medal" at a ceremony in Washington D.C., in 1996. The George Washington Carver Memorial Institute has honoured his work to help make better relationships between people of different races.
In 1971, Graham's hometown of "Charlotte" held a "Billy Graham Day", to which President Richard Nixon came. On May 30, 1999, Graham was invited to speak right before the Indianapolis 500. On May 31, 2007, the $27 million "Billy Graham Library" was officially started in Charlotte. Former Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton came. In 1990, the band "The Swirling Eddies" gave homage to Graham with its song "Billy Graham" on the album "Outdoor Elvis".
Graham got the "Big Brother of the Year Award" for his work on behalf of children. He also got the "Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in Religion" and the "Sylvanus Thayer Award" for his commitment to "Duty, Honor, and Country." The "Billy Graham Children's Health Center" in Asheville is named after him. There is a special chair named after him at the Southern Baptist Samford University; the "Billy Graham Chair of Evangelism and Church Growth."

Daubechies wavelet

Daubechies wavelets are a family of orthogonal wavelets named after Belgian physicist and mathematician Ingrid Daubechies. They are used in discrete wavelet transform.
Scale function coefficients (low pass filter in orthogonal filter banks) must satisfy following conditions (formula_1 is length of filter).
which implies
There is more than one solution (except case of formula_12). However, it is necessary to distinguish between low pass and high pass filter.
Wavelets are denoted like D"x", where "x" is either number of coefficients (formula_1) or number of vanishing moments (formula_14). First case of notation (number of coefficients) is more recent and more frequented (e.g. D8 is wavelet with 8 coefficients).

Straight pool

Straight pool, also called 14.1 continuous or simply 14.1, is a pocket billiards (pool) game. It was the common sport of championship competition until faster-playing games like nine-ball and to a lesser extent eight-ball became more popular. This is the classic game from the history of pool.
The game was especially popular in the United States, and was the subject of the classic 1961 film "The Hustler".
In straight pool, the person shooting may attempt to pocket any ball on the table. The aim of the game is to reach a set number of points. The amount of points needed to win is agreed to before the game. One point is scored for each ball pocketed legally (that is, without a foul). A typical game might require a player to score 100 points. This means that at least 100 balls must be pocketed to win. In professional competition, straight pool is usually played to 150 points. Straight pool is a call-pocket game. This means that the player must call what pocket they mean to sink the ball into on every shot. It does not matter how balls reach the pocket. As long as no foul is involved, and the balls goes into the pocket that is called, a point is scored.
Straight pool is well known in the United States, Europe, Japan and the Philippines, but the game has become more obscure elsewhere. Probably the all-time greatest player (by professional statistics), Willie Mosconi, holds the game's record high run. Here is what he said:
In the first rack in straight pool (when you place all the balls together before the break), the fifteen object balls (the colored balls) are racked in a triangular frame, usually made from aluminum, wooden, or plastic. The center of the ball at the top of the rack is placed over the a spot on the table called the foot spot. Traditionally, the 1 ball is placed at the rack's right corner, and the 5 ball is placed at the rack's left corner. Other balls are placed randomly. All the balls must touch their neighbors. However, it is considered a courtesy by some players to place a striped ball at the front of the rack. This is because the break is very important and it is believed that a striped ball is easier to hit very precisely.
In most pool games, pocketing a ball and spreading the balls is the aim on the break. Straight pool is different. In it, the goal on the first break shot is to leave the opponent with a "safety". A safety means a situation where they opponent has no good shot. The reason for this is because the call-pocket rule—the rule discussed earlier requiring the player to call the ball they intend to pocket—"includes" the break shot. For that reason, if you break the balls hard, and even if you pocket many balls, you will not be able to go again unless you called one of those balls in a pocket and it goes into that pocket.
To perform a legal break, either a ball must be pocketed in a called pocket or the cue ball and at least two additional colored balls must touch rails. If you do not succeed at one of these two options, the shot is a foul. A foul on the first break results in a special penalty of a loss of 2 points. In addition, the opponent has the choice of either accepting the table as it was left, or of having the balls re-racked and requiring the person who fouled on the break to repeat it. 
All other fouls during the game have a penalty of a one point deduction. This includes fouling on an "intragame" rack (a rack after the first rack, which are discussed later). However, a third foul "in a row" at any time in a straight pool game results in a loss of 15 points. When applying this rule, a foul on the initial break, though it is a loss of two points, is not counted as two fouls. The 15 point deduction is in addition to the one point loss for each foul. Thus, the first two fouls are a loss of one point each, and the third foul in a row is a loss of 16 points: 1 point for the foul, and 15 points for it being the third foul in a row.
"Intragame racks" refers to all racks after the first rack. As noted previously, straight pool is played to a specific number of points, normally far more than the 15 total points that can be made in the first rack. For this reason, multiple intragame racks are necessary. Intragame racking employs a separate set of rules from those in place at the game's start on the first rack.
To reach the point in time when an intragame rack is needed, the balls are played until only the cue ball and only one object ball remain on the table's surface. At that time, if neither the cue ball or the fifteenth object ball remains in the rack area (or is interfering with racking in the rack area) the fourteen pocketed object balls are racked with no ball placed at the top of the rack, and the rack is placed so that "if the top ball were in the rack", its center would be placed over the table's foot spot. Play then continues with the cue ball shot from where it rested, and the fifteenth, non-racked object ball from where it rested prior to racking. 
The name "14.1 continuous" is named after this racking method. That is, that fourteen (14) racked object balls and one (.1) separate colored ball are left at the end of each intragame rack. The shooter will then normally try to pocket the unracked fifteenth colored ball, and at the same time have the cue ball smash into the fourteen racked balls, spreading them so that later shots are available, and the player continue at the table.
A number of rules detail what must be done when one or both of the cue ball and fifteenth object ball are either in the rack area at the time an intragame rack is neeeded, or are so close to the intragame racking area, that the racking of the 14 balls cannot be done without moving one of them. The rules also vary depending on whether the cue ball or fifteenth object ball are resting on the table's head spot. These rules are shown on the following chart. Note that in the chart the use of the word kitchen refers to the area behind the table's head string.

General intelligence factor

The general intelligence factor, often shortened to g, is a construct from psychology. It is the common factor in intelligence tests. It is the result of measuring intelligence in different ways. 
Charles Spearman, an early statistician and psychologist, found that school children's grades across unrelated subjects were strongly related to each other. That is to say, children who were good at one area (such as reading) were also good in another area (such as math). He then proposed that these relationships reflected the influence of a dominant factor, which he called "g" for "general" intelligence. He developed a model where all variation in intelligence test scores can be explained by two factors. The first is the factor specific to an individual mental task: the individual abilities that would make a person more skilled at one cognitive task than another. The second is "g", a general factor that governs performance on all cognitive tasks.
After 120 years of cognitive testing, "g"s central role is still a meaningful measure. Other models have also been proposed, and there is significant controversy about "g" and its alternatives.

Wikipedia:Very good articles/Billy Graham

William Franklin Graham, Jr. (born November 7, 1918) better known as Billy Graham, is an Evangelical Christian and an evangelist. He is a member of the Southern Baptist Convention. He has been a spiritual advisor to many U.S. presidents. Graham has preached in person to more people than anyone else who has ever lived. Until 2002, Graham's lifetime audience, with radio and television broadcasts, was more than two billion. Graham has met every United States President since Harry Truman. He has received many honors including the "Congressional Gold Medal" and the "Presidential Medal of Freedom".
Billy Graham was born on a dairy farm near Charlotte, North Carolina. He was the son of Morrow Coffey and William Franklin Graham. In 1933, Graham's father forced Graham and his sister Catherine to drink beer until they vomited. This made them hate alcohol for the rest of their lives. The Billy Graham Center says Graham was converted in 1934 during a revival meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina. However, he did not become a member of a local youth group because he was "too worldly." He then went to see the local evangelist Mordecai Ham. After graduating from Sharon High School in May 1936, Graham went to Bob Jones College (now called Bob Jones University).

For some time now I've listened to quite a few people say that we need to focus on mainspace growth of the project. So, I've been thinking about a few things. Firstly, I wanted to figure out what has been preventing some people from working on articles that they may have an interest in. I thought a lot about it and think it might come down to two main reasons. The first I thought about is that quite a few people have said that they are not very good at editing articles or that they lack confidence in doing so. So with that in mind I have begun a series of "lectures" and "lessons" that can be read and worked through so that people who would like to learn more about editing can do so at their leisure. The first of these is a series about sourcing and citing information found within articles. It is located . Other series of lectures will cover what is simpler English, what should an article contain, as well as others. I hope guest lecturers will sign up and also write courses for others to use. WE have some very good writers who can offer others a lot of good advice. 
The second factor that occurred to me is a lack of a means of focusing on what to do within mainspace. So,my second initiative is aimed at the direct improvement of existing articles and the creation of brand new articles. I call it and it is intended to act as a focusing medium that gives ideas of articles to work on, but does so by encouraging people to partner up with a buddy. Ideally the partnerships could also be used to encourage really experienced writers to team up with novice writers. Hopefully we can get some important articles up to or even status. 
That's it for my first article for Simple News. Take care all, and happy editing! 20:06, 25 October 2009 (UTC)

Thomas Quasthoff

Thomas Quasthoff (born Hildesheim, Germany, 9 November 1959) is a German bass-baritone. He is thought of as one of the best singers of today. It was not easy for him to get a good musical education because of his physical disability. However, he has became one of the world’s finest singers of German song (Lieder) and he also sings a wide variety of styles including Baroque music, opera and jazz.
Quasthoff was born in Hildesheim, Germany. His mother had been taking the drug thalidomide during the pregnancy and this resulted in Thomas being born with physical handicaps. He has flipper-like hands and no arms, and he has very short legs.
Quasthoff wanted to study music at the conservatory, but he was not allowed to do so because there was a rule that every music student had to play the piano. It was impossible for Quasthoff to play an instrument because of his disability.
Quasthoff decided to study singing privately. After he had graduated from school he went to university to study law. He did not enjoy the subject, and after studying for three years he chose music as a career. At first he worked as a radio announcer. He got some experience in singing oratorio. Then, in 1988, he won the ARD International Music Competition in Munich. Many people, including Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, were very impressed with his singing. He became known as a Lieder singer. He first sang in America in 1995. He won many awards, including the Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Performance in 2000. It was for his performance together with the mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter of Mahler’s Des Knaben Wunderhorn. They were accompanied by the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Claudio Abbado. He won prizes for his singing of songs by Schubert, Brahms and Liszt, and Bach Cantatas. 
Quasthoff teaches singing at the Hanns Eisler School of Music in Berlin. He is "artist in residence" at the Barbican Hall, London. A series called "Die Stimme" (The Voice) was made to celebrate his 50th birthday. It was also the title of his autobiography which was published in 2006.
In 2006 he married. His wife is a television journalist. The couple have a daughter and they live in Berlin.

Humanitarianism is a way of behaving out of kindness to other people. Someone who is a humanitarian is a person who helps to improve the lives of other people without thinking about their race, belief or nationality.
Humanitarianism is not the same thing as Humanism which is about not believing in a god. 
A good example of Humanitarianism is the well-known story from the New Testament about the Good Samaritan who goes to help the poor man who has been robbed.
Humanitarianism also means basic morality indispensable for human being. There are international laws called "international humanitarian laws" considered to created out of humanitarianism of this mean. Among them, Geneva Conventions on the matter made at the time of wars are well known.

Drosophila

Drosophila is a genus of small flies, belonging to the family Drosophilidae, whose members are often called "fruit flies". 
There are many species in this genus. Some do prefer places where there is rotting fruit. The adults may feed on nectar, and may lay their eggs on or near decaying fruit. The details differ greatly from species to species. The largest number of species is in the Hawaiian Islands. Some fruit flies can get drunk if they have a gene called "Happy Hour".
One species of "Drosophila" in particular, "D. melanogaster", has been heavily used in research in genetics and is a common model organism in developmental biology. The genus has more than 1,500 species, and has varied appearance, behaviour, and breeding habitats.
Males of this genus are known to have the longest sperm cells of any organism on Earth. One species, "Drosophila bifurca", has sperm long. The cells are mostly tail, and are delivered to the females in tangled coils. Those "Drosophila" species with very long sperms make relatively few sperm cells. "D. melanogaster" sperm cells are a more modest 1.8 mm long, although this is still about 300 times longer than a human sperm. 
Several species in the "D. melanogaster" species group are known to mate by traumatic insemination, in which the male pierces the female's abdomen with his penis and injects his sperm through the wound into her abdominal cavity (haemocoel).
"Drosophila" vary widely in their reproductive capacity. Those such as "D. melanogaster" that breed in large, scarce resources have ovaries that mature 10–20 eggs at a time, and can be laid together in one place. Others, which breed in common but less nutritious places (such as leaves), may only lay one egg each day.
The eggs have one or more respiratory filaments near the front end; the tips of these extend above the surface and allow oxygen to reach the embryo. Larvae feed not on vegetable matter but on the yeasts and microorganisms present on the decaying surface of leaves or fruits. Development time varies widely between species (between seven and more than 60 days) and depends on factors such as temperature, breeding substrate, and crowding.

St. Alban

St. Alban was the first British Christian martyr. He was a Roman soldier who converted to Christianity. 
A priest was being chased by the Romans and St. Alban swapped clothes with the priest so he could escape. When they found out, the romans ordered St. Alban to be killed. As he was a fine soldier, he was allowed to be beheaded by the sword than by the axe, because it was more honorable. When they cut off St. Alban's head, the executioner's eyes fell out into his hand, and he was blinded. 
The bones of St. Alban were kept in a shrine in St. Albans Abbey. They were stolen during the 19th century. The town of St. Albans is named after him.

Lō'ihi Seamount, also known as Loihi or Lōihi, is an submarine volcano (seamount) in the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. It lies in the Pacific Ocean south of the island of Hawaii. 
Lōihi is an active volcano.
In 1995, the United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) changed a longtime policy and is now using the Hawaiian okina and kahakō in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). After 1995, Loihi seamount was officially identified as Lōʻihi.
Lōihi seamount is 32 miles from the peak of Mauna Loa. This small volcano is in on the slopes of the larger and older one. Lōihi Seamount is over 3,000 metres above the sea floor. It is as tall as the volcano Mount St Helens was before it erupted. 
In 2012, the top of this volcano is one kilometre below the sea,
Lōihi is predicted to grow until it is an island, thousands of years from now.

Hi there!
I think we should move the to pages with over 5,000 versions to a "versions archive" or something like . This would give admins the ability to delete the page and restore it. I wasn't sure if I should simply move the pages to /versions1. Now, only oversights can delete the pages if vandalism appears. And btw: yes, revisions delete will be enable, but no one knows when our devs think it is the time for it. Any thoughts? () 20:43, 18 October 2009 (UTC)
Could someone who understands this template have a look at it because it is now making incorrect conversions. -- () 01:37, 17 October 2009 (UTC)
<-- so I broke it again, well sorta It's fixed in the normal sense (the ones you were talking about generally) but we're having the old problems with infoboxes and some other copied en data. After way to long I discovered this is because we really don't have the entire template, we have a very boiled down version of it. This means that alot of the syntax used in copied over infoboxes etc doesn't work and isn't anywhere within the current template (for example there is only kg and lb for weight there is no ton or LT used in the locomotive infoboxes. Sadly this effects ALOT of pages (all locomotive and Lake infoboxes for example) and isn't an issue fixed by editing the infoboxes it's actually a syntax problem on the pages themselves. We are able to do almost everything we want to rewording those pages but we would have to do it everywhere which would take to much time. That said what we need to do is import the entire template from En, which sadly is A BUNCH of templates all used together so it could take some time. PMLinediter is trying it out right now, I'll let you know if it succeeds :). () 12:52, 18 October 2009 (UTC)
I'm fine with anything, If someone decides to go ahead and import them while I'm gone please do the actual template/convert LAST, it must be deleted completely here before it is re imported because of how we have it currently set up. Importing it all first while we have the semi broken template up is better then importing a template that will break half the site :). () 13:38, 18 October 2009 (UTC)
Here is what I did...
Importing pages...
Import finished! 
Thanks, () 17:14, 18 October 2009 (UTC)

Hiya gang! Recently, on IRC, a suggestion came up about dealing with open proxies on all Simple English WMF projects at the same time. The creation of a adminbot (proxyblocker) that'd block proxies for all sites at the same time. This came up because on simpleWQ today an open proxy vandal (the same one as here of late) begun an attack there. This proxy had already been blocked here on simpleWP for some time. As such, it might be useful to get some discussion going about the need for such a tool, what it would look like, what it would do and what it would not do. Suggestions so far have ranged from a non-admin bot that dumps a list of proxies to block into AN on the projects (or another page) to a bot with the sysop flag that finds the proxies and deals with them. It was also wondered about if this should be a new bot (EhJJ expressed interest in writing it) or an existing bot (IE: en:User:Slakr's bot) Thoughts? 00:04, 13 October 2009 (UTC)
I think there are two things that would be nice and would support both:
I think they would be separate proposals and to be honest I think we should do 1. regardless of whether we do 2 or not. () 06:34, 13 October 2009 (UTC)
I propose that we begin to follow the same system like the one that meta has "successfully" executed in that:
The actual meta text reads, which I propose here:
Where the two positions are bundled together. Administrators already judge consensus on discussions, this will telescope into RFx discussions as well. Additionally, administrators who are interested in helping in bot and/or renaming areas, can do so. After some discussion, I intend we put it to a straw poll vote/!vote as well. Thank you for yout consideration. () 15:23, 25 October 2009 (UTC)
I supported this last time someone suggested it. I would rather however, that someone need to be an admin for a year rather than 6 months. So we can see a commitment to staying around. I think 6 months is a relatively short time. This will help to avoid people trying to race to crat and then disappearing right away. - () 20:51, 25 October 2009 (UTC)
I'm not a big fan of the "uninvolved crat" bit. I think people are able to act without a conflict of interest even in a matter they have participated in. To enforce it being an uninvolved person says that for each event someone is not permitted to vote. I think anyone should be able to take part in anything, so I'd prefer that to change personally. 21:13, 26 October 2009 (UTC)
So what's the agreement? 13:30, 1 November 2009 (UTC)
Hello there, I did a little count:
And there are between five and ten regular, unprivileged contributors (not counting rollback as a privilege). Would it not be time to change something? - Grinning sheepishly -- () 13:58, 1 November 2009 (UTC)
I don't know, this is perhaps a short notice, but on Nov. 5, 1605 the Gunpowder Plot took place; influential catholics wanted to kill King James I of England, and most of the (Protestant) aristocracy. Guy Fawkes was the man in charge, even though Robert Catesby did the planning.
Anyway, if we want ot do anything meaningful, the articles need to be written and brought up to a certain standard. This is of course just an idea...-- () 22:16, 1 November 2009 (UTC)
Because there are a lot of users who work on multiple Simple English projects I thought it would be a good idea to draw people's attention to the discussion posted by Anonymous_Dissident proposing that Simple English Wikiquote be closed. - 13:01, 23 October 2009 (UTC)
Not all of the community follows closely, so with that in mind, I bring attention to . The details of the block are final, but BG7 has issued a statement that may be of interest to many. Regards, 00:03, 3 November 2009 (UTC)
There has been much talk in this community about the prevelance of articles on cities and towns that are one-two sentences plus, if you're lucky, an infobox. With regard to the U.S. and Canada, I think that we should pick ~1,000 American cities and ~100 Canadian cities, and those articles need to be created and then expanded, or at least not deleted. Sort of a prototype SimWikiProject Cities' top and high priorities. I have created the beginnings of such a list, which can be found at . Feel free to comment on that list.

Hey guys. I was just browsing when I came across the Gale article. Looks like one of the templates used in the article is outdated or something and it isn't reading it properly. I think it is in the conversions from knots to km/h. I fixed most of it, but there is still the one "Template:Convert/LoffAoffDbSon" redlink there. I am not sure what is causing that. If somebody could take a look at that and try to make something of it, that would be great. Thanks!-- |  16:41, 4 November 2009 (UTC)

As you might know, is a city in Nebraska. Since it had like 470 people in 2000, it would likely be a one-sentence stub, or similar to the EnWP article, that only lists statistics.
Since there are editors working on fixing the problem, I think we should simply give a deadline. One-sentence-stubs are deletable by current deletion policy. I therefore propose that starting next year, anyone who comes across such an article should delete it, if they have the right tools. Even if we delete one or two too much, such articles are easy to re-create with hopefully better content. And before I forget, Iqaluit is the capital of Nunavut. About 7.500 people live there. -- () 15:55, 6 November 2009 (UTC)

This policy was , it was then brought up again and appeared to be getting unanimous support. Deciding that we had had enough conversation was not an invalid decision (in my opinion) especially since the last time it was brought up people apparently decided it wasn't that important to oppose. If people have a problem with the policy let's talk about it (It is obviously not hard to give back the bit), if not lets move on. As anyone who has seen my comments before on inactive admins you'll obviously realize I'm biased (I think 6 months inactivity is easily enough for it to be taken away and that the En attitude about it is somewhat stupid) () 23:09, 8 November 2009 (UTC)

After almost 4 hours of work (3 hours without wanting to ask for help and then another hour after I got pointed in the right direction of what I have missing) we have protection templates with the correct top icon. I am going to bed :) but we will want to adjust the wording on templates so they are simpler (not to mention the docs). I will definitely work on simplifying the templates tomorrow. If you want to know a bit more technical but important data about what I did see below if not just skip it :) However, if you see any issues with ANY top icons please let me know so that I can fix them, it isn't hard but I may have missed some (for why see below). Also: obligatory thank you to for the help :).
Warning somewhat technical and boring info ignore if bored easily
As part of the fix I made some changes to how ALL of our top icons work. We are no longer using the old java script method we were using before because I was worried about some problems that it could cause. I therefore removed that class and totally replaced it with the new "topicon" class using css (from en). On the recommendation of MZMcbride I also imported a script from En that keeps the top icons working when there is a global notice that pushes them down. All of these changes have been added to the global monobook.css and .js. They appear to be working for all users in other skins but if I need to I'll move them over to common.css and .js because they should still work just as well there. If you have any questions about what I did please feel free to let me know either here, on irc,email,talk page whatever works :) Oh and if you want to make your own. () 09:26, 9 November 2009 (UTC)

Just as I say that, all seems to be back to normal. 18:40, 12 November 2009 (UTC)
I've been thinking about this lately, and in my opinion we should just delete complex articles, regardless of whether or no they're copied from the English Wikipedia verbatim. I therefore propose adding "Too complex" to the QD criteria. This could be a bit vague, but we would ideally leave it to the reviewing admin to determine if the article is really too complicated to justify keeping it around. Really if an article isn't written in Simple English, it doesn't belong on Simple Wikipedia. – |  00:58, 13 November 2009 (UTC)
I would have to agree with DJSasso here. Everyone will have a different sense of complexity, so one article that may be complex to one user, may not be complex for another user. As DJSasso said, it is too subjective. It would have to be for pages that are so complex that not even a professor could understand it. 04:34, 13 November 2009 (UTC)
I support the proposal in principle however I do think that before it's implemented it will need some discussion and working out of exactly what constitutes complex. The automated tool could be used to give an idea (though should not be used on its own at all) and then sentence length, word length and the general lexis used within the text. (Sorry, in English lesson as I write this, lots of big English terms being used :P) Perhaps if not a QD criteria it could be something that articles can be more readily RfD'd for, without getting responses such as "" and the like (yes, I know this is all slightly hypocritical). Perhaps also we could run a "trial" whereby articles that would be QDable under the new criteria are listed on a page and then the admins (or wider community) can see if they would agree or not. This could also be done through an RfD. Just my 2p :) 14:32, 13 November 2009 (UTC) 
(<-) Hello, I think that the subject is more complex than it looks at first. In theory, we could go with the "quick deletion" of a "complex" article, but with a few provisions:
Once we are through checking all those steps, we are probably not talking about "quick deletion" any more - we might as well file a regular RfD. As always, just my thoughts. -- () 19:50, 13 November 2009 (UTC)
Can't we have/is there a page with all the pages tagged with "complex", to see how many articles we'd potentially lose? 22:22, 13 November 2009 (UTC)
If you'd like to hide it, just copy my to your . -- () 17:56, 13 November 2009 (UTC)

Mines of Paris

The Mines of Paris (in French Carrières de Paris — "quarries of Paris") are made up of a number of abandoned, underground mines under Paris, France, connected together by large chambers called galleries. Three main networks exist; the largest, called the "grand réseau sud" ("large south network"), lies under the Ve, VIe, XIVe and XVe arrondissements, a second under the XIIIe arrondissement, and a third under the XVIe, though other minor networks are found under the XIIe, XIVe and XVIe for instance. Together, the mines and galleries run for about 280 kilometres. 
Exploring the mines is not allowed by the prefecture and people caught get heavy fines. A limited part of the network (1.7 km) was used as an underground ossuary (storage place for human bones) in the past known as the catacombs of Paris, and can be legally visited from the entrance on Place Denfert-Rochereau. The entire network is commonly but mistakenly called "the catacombs". Despite restrictions, the network is often toured by urban explorers popularly called cataphiles.
During the 18th century, the growing population of Paris resulted in the filling up of existing cemeteries, raising public health concerns. Towards the end of the 18th century, it was decided to create three new large cemeteries and to the existing cemeteries within the city limits. Human remains were slowly moved to a rebuilt section of the abandoned mines that would later become a ossuary. The entrance is located on present day "Place Denfert-Rochereau".
The ossuary became a tourist attraction on from the early 19th century and has been open to the public on a regular basis from 1867. Although it is officially called the "Ossuaire Municipal", it is widely known as "the catacombs". Though the entire network of Paris' mines is not a burial place as such, the term 'Catacombs' is commonly used to refer to the whole network.

I've Got a Secret

I've Got a Secret was a weekly game show produced by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman for CBS television. It was a "panel" game show, which means that it had, in addition to a host and guests, a group of people who together acted as judges. The show was created by comedy writers Allan Sherman and Howard Merrill. It was related to Goodson-Todman's other panel show, "What's My Line?". The first episode of the show aired on June 19, 1952 and ran until April 3, 1967. The first version of the show was in black and white. It switched to color in 1966. 
The show was canceled in 1967 and then brought back for the 1972-1973 season in once-a-week and again from June 15 to July 6, 1976, for a summer run. Another production ran on the Oxygen cable channel in a daily version, airing from 2000 through 2003. GSN ran a revival from April 17 to June 9, 2006 with an all-gay panel. In October 2006, GSN decided not to renew the show for a second season, although reruns remained on its schedule for some time afterward.
The show was first hosted by radio and television personality Garry Moore. After several months of an panel that kept changing, the show settled down to include game show host Bill Cullen, comedian Henry Morgan, TV hostess Faye Emerson, and actress Jayne Meadows. In 1958, Emerson left the show to star in a play and was replaced by actress Betsy Palmer. The following year, Meadows moved to the West Coast to live with her husband Steve Allen and was replaced by former Miss America Bess Myerson. Sometimes, guest hosts substituted for Moore, including panelists Morgan and Palmer. Also, other comedians and celebrities guested for the panel when they were away.
Garry Moore left the show after the 1963-64 season, after his comedy program "The Garry Moore Show" was canceled, and he decided to retire from television to travel around the world with his wife. Moore was replaced by Steve Allen on September 21, 1964. Allen also hosted the show during the 1972-1973 revival. Former panelist Bill Cullen hosted the show for its short 1976 CBS summer run. The panelists on this revival were Richard Dawson, Henry Morgan, New York-based entertainment critic Pat Collins, and Elaine Joyce.
The Oxygen channel version of the show was hosted by Stephanie Miller until August 2001. Panelists in the Oxygen version included Jim J. Bullock, Jason Kravits, Amy Yasbeck, and Teri Garr. The GSN version was hosted by Bil Dwyer; the panelists were Billy Bean, Frank DeCaro, Jermaine Taylor, and Suzanne Westenhoefer.
Each episode usually had two contestants. After that, a celebrity guest played. Once in a while, if there was extra time, the celebrity was followed by a third regular guest.
Each round was a guessing game. The panel tried to figure out the contestants' "secrets". The idea of a "secret" on the show was very broad. Secrets were always intended to be unusual, amazing, embarrassing or . They often were about what happened to a person, owning something, or a job, hobby, success or skill.
One or more would walk on. The host would tell the name the contestant or ask their name and where they were from. He would then ask them to "whisper your secret to me, and we'll show it to the folks at home." The contestant would then whisper their secret to the host, while the audience and television viewers were shown the secret by writing printed on the television screen. Then the host would give the panel a clue. For example, "the secret concerns something that happened to [Contestant's Name]." The host would then choose a panelist to begin asking questions.
When the show first started, each panelist had 15 seconds of questioning of a guest. Then this would repeat once. Each 15 seconds that passed without the secret being correctly guessed won the contestant $10. However, a guest could not win more than $80. In mid-1954, they changed to only one question period for each panelist. They changed the money to $20 so that the top prize would stay at $80. Also, the time limit for questions was no longer exact. Instead, a went off to end the questioning, and production staff decided when to use the buzzer. This was partly because the program was shown live (not taped), and this sometimes required the show to be longer or shorter to keep the show running on time. In later times, the panelists were sometimes buzzed when they were too close to the secret, or at a point that would get a laugh.
Following the guest's secret being discovered, the host sometimes asked the contestant more about their secret, or, if it made sense, the contestant demonstrated their secret. These demonstrations sometimes included the host, and sometimes one or more of the panelists.
A number of famous people appeared with secrets, including Col. Harland Sanders who founded Kentucky Fried Chicken ("I started my restaurant with my first Social Security check"), Philo T. Farnsworth ("I invented electronic television"), Pete Best ("I used to be one of THE BEATLES"), and an elderly man, Samuel Seymour, who was the last surviving eyewitness to Abraham Lincoln's assassination (he was 5 years old at the time).
On each usual episode, a celebrity guest came on the show with a secret. The celebrity usually started the episode by coming out from the behind the curtain and saying "my name is [Name] and I've Got a Secret!". Sometimes, though, the celebrity would say "and this is "I've Got a Secret"!". In the beginning, the celebrities would have a secret. The secrets would sometimes be personal secrets, similar to the other contestants. Other times the secret would be about something they were there to do. The guest part of the show often was really a was to show some new technology or product.
Later in the show, a common thing was for the celebrity to challenge the panel in some other game. This later became the main use of the celebrity part of the show, and they no longer pretended to have a secret. Instead, the celebrity would just come out with a challenge for the panel. Several of these challenges later were the main idea used for other game shows. For example, a game in which Woody Allen challenged the panel to guess words by what children had said they meant, which became the basis for "Child's Play". Or two challenges with Peter Falk and Soupy Sales in which the panel had to guess who a celebrity was after being show a photographs of them as a baby and others as the aged, which later was used for the show, "Face the Music".
"I've Got a Secret" was more informal than its sister show "What's My Line?". The panel and host used each other's first names. As noted, the time limit on questioning was removed early in the show', and time limits were set more for entertainment. The men on the panel always wore normal suits or even sport jackets, though both Morgan and Moore sometimes chose bow ties over straight ties. Until the later years of the series, both Moore, and members of the panel smoked cigarettes on the air. The panel was introduced at the start of each episode by the host, usually with a pun on their names.
Only yes-or-no questions were supposed to be asked by the panel, but this was often relaxed. Unlike on "What's My Line?", the host offered hints and suggestions when the panel was quite lost, or when an answer might make them lost. Like on "What's My Line?", the panelists were not allowed to try to figure out secrets together, but later in the series, no one bothered the panelists when they whispered ideas to each other.
The series began in black-and-white, and only in 1966 switched to color. When the show is seen in reruns, though even episodes which were in color are in black and white, as they did not "record" the color. Much of the series had a commercial sponsor. The opening of the show would have an advertisement for that company. Signs on the set also promoted the products, and on commercial breaks the product would be advertised. Some sponsors provided samples of their products, which were given to each contestant. Late in the series, sponsorship was stopped.
An Australian version of the show was produced and aired in Brisbane on QTQ Channel 9 from 1967 until 1973. It was hosted by Newsreader Don Secombe. Similar to the American version, it had regular celebrity panelists including Ron Cadee, Babette Stevens and Joy Chambers.
The format of the 1970s revivals were very similar to the original series. However celebrity secrets were back, as opposed to challenges.
On the Oxygen revival, the contestant earned $200, and if no one on the panel guessed, they earned a $1,000 prize. Stephanie Miller hosted this version. The show's set was made to look like a fancy city apartment.
On GSN's revival, each panelist had 40 seconds for questioning, with one conference allowed. Stumping the entire panel won the contestant $1,000 and "dinner for 2 in Beverly Hills." The fine print at the end of the show disclosed that contestants were also paid an appearance fee. Losing contestants also received some unspecified parting gifts. Several minor show business professionals demonstrated their performances on the show, including piano juggler Dan Menendez. Another element in the revival was that all the panelists were openly gay. This was played upon as host, Bill Dwyer, was introduced as "the straight man to the panel".
As with "What's My Line?", early episodes from the original series' first season in 1952 appear to have been lost. From late 1952 until the 1967 cancellation, most episodes appear to exist as a digital transfer of the original black-and-white kinescope movies.
GSN concluded its most recent airing of "I've Got A Secret"'s run on July 13, 2008 at 3:30 AM (ET), paired with "What's My Line?" at 3:00. However, they began their run in mid-2007 with episodes from late 1961 or early 1962. A good portion of the series is unlikely to be aired, due to the show's longtime sponsorship by Winston cigarettes, which remains an existing brand. It is unclear whether this is mandated legally, or simply a choice by GSN. In addition, the network skipped several episodes through its run which are known to have been skipped in previous runs of the show; this may mean that other episodes are lost or in bad enough condition for GSN not to air them.
All subsequent revivals of "Secret" exist in their entirety. GSN has occasionally aired single episodes from the 1972-1973 season, the latest being an episode featuring Bob Barker as the celebrity guest, to commemorate his retirement from "The Price Is Right" in mid-2007. GSN also occasionally adds reruns of its 2006 revival to the regular schedule.
The first theme music used on the show from 1952-1961 was "Plink, Plank, Plunk!" by Leroy Anderson (this theme can be heard on the album "Classic TV Game Show Themes". However, the theme on the CD was credited to Norman Paris).
The second theme, used from 1961-1962, was an upbeat arrangement of the "Theme to "A Summer Place"" by Max Steiner.
The third theme was used from 1962-1967. It was an upbeat, spritely march featuring piccolo and xylophone, composed by the show's musical director Norman Paris and played by a live studio combo. It quoted a familiar melody widely associated with schoolyard taunts, to which the words "I've got a secret!" might be sung by children in a teasing manner.
In addition to being used as a tag for his entrance on CBS episodes he hosted, Steve Allen's composition "This Could Be the Start of Something" was used as the opening theme in 1972. The closing theme to the 1972 version was written by Edd Kalehoff. The theme from the 1976 version with Bill Cullen was used one year later on the ABC game show "Second Chance". A remix of that theme was also used in the Australian version of "Family Feud".
Tim Mosher and Stoker are credited with the 2000 theme, while Alan Ett and Scott Liggett contributed an up jazz theme for Bil Dwyer's 2006 version of the show for GSN.

Carrow Road

Carrow Road is a British football stadium in Norwich, England. It is the home of Norwich City Football Club. The stadium is in the centre of the city, near to Norwich railway station and the River Wensum.
The stadium is on Carrow Road, and is named after the road. The stadium was built by Norwich City in 1935. Construction took just 82 days. There has been a lot of work done to Carrow Road since 1935. Since 1990 the stadium has been an all-seater. The ground can accommodate 27,244 today and the record attendance is presently 27,091. The record attendance at Carrow Road before it became an all-seater stadium was 43,984 in 1963. The modern Carrow Road site has a club superstore, catering facilities and a Holiday Inn hotel.
Norwich City F.C. played at Newmarket Road from 1902 to 1908. The record attendance at this time was 10,366 in a match against Sheffield Wednesday in a second round FA Cup match in 1908. After a disagreement over the rent of the Newmarket Road ground, Norwich City moved to a new home in 1908 - a converted disused chalk pit in Rosary Road which became known as The Nest.
By the 1930s, the ground was not big enough for the growing support. Expansion of The Nest was not possible, and there were safety problems with the existing structures. The club began looking for another ground in 1926. Part of the pitch eventually collapsed. The Football Association were not happy with Norwich City’s efforts to repair The Nest. They eventually wrote to the club on 15 May 1935, saying " The Nest was no longer suitable for large crowds and measures must be taken".
With the new season just weeks away, Norwich City were very concerned. About half a mile south of The Nest, they found a new site, the home of the Boulton Paul Aircraft Sports Ground in Carrow Road. On 1 June 1935, the club purchased the ground on a 20-year lease, from its owners Colman's.
The new stadium took its name from the street. However, the name "Carrow" originally referred to the former Carrow Abbey that once stood on the riverside. Construction began quickly. Ten days after buying the site, work began.
By 17 August most of the stands and terraces had been completed. Finally, after just 82 days, on 31 August Carrow Road football ground was opened for the Second Division match v West Ham United.
Norwich won the game 4-3. The attendance was 29,779 – at the time, a new record crowd for Norwich home games. The first competitive goal at the ground was scored by Norwich's Doug Lochhead.
An aerial photograph from August 1935 shows three sides of open terracing and a covered stand, with a Colman's Mustard advertisement painted on its roof, visible only from the air. The club's association with Colman's has continued into the modern era; in 1997 the club signed a shirt sponsorship deal with the company. The mustard manufacturer's original factory was next to the stadium in Carrow Road, and the ground was opened by Russell Colman, the President of the club. Inglis describes the early Carrow Road as comprising "a Main Stand, a covered end terrace and two large open banks". The covered terrace was paid for by Captain Evelyn Barclay, the vice-president of Norwich City. It was constructed in time for the opening of the 1937-38 season. There is a stand named after Barclay in the modern stadium.
At this time, the ground's capacity was 38,000. The new ground received a royal seal of approval: on 29 October 1938, King George VI watched the home game versus Millwall. This was the first time a ruling monarch had watched a Second Division match.
Floodlights were erected at the ground in 1956 and the £9,000 cost nearly sent the club into bankruptcy. However, Norwich's success in the 1959 FA Cup secured the financial status of the club and provided sufficient funds for a cover to be built over the South Stand. In 1963, the record was set for attendance for Carrow Road: a crowd of 43,984 watched a sixth round FA Cup match against Leicester City, and the South Stand (now the Jarrold) was covered "soon after".
After a disaster at Glasgow Ranger’s Ground, Ibrox in 1971, ground capacities had to be reduced to around 20,000 people. 
A two-tier terrace was built at the River End. Soon afterwards, seats began to replace the terraces. By 1979 the stadium had a capacity of 28,392 with seats for 12,675. A fire in 1984 partially destroyed one of the stands. The damaged stand was eventually demolished completely. In 1987 it was replaced by a new City Stand. Chairman Robert Chase said that "Coming to a football match within the City Stand is very much like going to the theatre – the only difference being that our stage is covered with grass".
After a disaster at Sheffield Wednesday’s ground Hillsborough in 1989 and, afterwards, the outcome of the Taylor Report in 1990, the stadium was converted to all-seater with the corners being filled. Today, Carrow Road is an all-seater stadium, with a capacity of 26,034, with a record attendance for an all-seated crowd of 25,522 for the Premiership match against Manchester United in April 2005.
The South Stand was replaced in 2003 when a new 7,000 seat South stand, subsequently renamed the Jarrold Stand was built in its place. The club installed new electronic screen/scoreboards at either end of the stadium in 2007. Behind the goals, they are full colour, with scope for still and moving images. They were first used in the 5-2 Carling Cup victory over Barnet F.C. in August 2007.
The current stadium consists of five stands; the Barclay (sponsored by Coral] (the northeastern stand), the River End known as the Norwich and Peterborough Stand (the southwestern stand), the Geoffrey Watling City Stand (the northwestern stand), the Jarrold Stand (the southeastern stand) and the most recent addition, the Aviva Community Stand (the southern stand).
The previous River End stand (named due to it being close to the River Wensum) was demolished in April 1979. A two-tiered replacement, costing £1.7m, was completed in December 1979. Its name was changed to the Norwich & Peterborough Stand in the 1990s due to a sponsorship deal with the Norwich & Peterborough building society.
This stand is named after Captain Evelyn Barclay, a former vice-president of the club, who donated the roof costs for the original stand. The Barclay is often incorrectly referred to as the Barclay Stand.
The original Barclay was built in 1937 and demolished in 1992, when a new two-tier structure, modelled on the River End (now the Norwich & Peterborough Stand) was built at a cost of £2.8m (offset by a £2m grant from the Football Trust).
Floodlights are supported on both corners of the Barclay and the Norwich & Peterborough stands, which are the ends behind the goals.
The single-tiered Geoffrey Watling City Stand was built following a severe fire on 25 October 1984. The fire was apparently caused by an employee of the club leaving a three-bar electric fire switched on overnight. The City Stand (as it was named at the time) cost £1.7 million to build and was used for the first time on 30 August 1986 when City hosted Southampton. It was formally opened by the Duchess of Kent on 14 February 1987. The stand was renamed in honour of Norwich City president Geoffrey Watling, who died in 2004.
The stand is the smallest of the four in terms of capacity, but includes the Directors' Box, Press Area, and various other hospitality suites.
Where The Barclay extends around to meet the Geoffrey Watling City Stand, is the Thorpe Corner infill, "affectionately dubbed 'The Snakepit' by supporters", a term that is even sometimes used in official club reports.
The Jarrold Stand is on the former site of the South Stand, which was named in honour of Sir Arthur South.
The Jarrold Stand was partially opened for the game against Sheffield United on 31 January 2004, and fully opened for the next home match against West Ham United on 21 February 2004. This was a landmark for the stadium - it represented the final stand of the original ground to be replaced.
The Jarrold Stand is sponsored by Jarrolds, a local department store. The original 4-year sponsorship deal has now been extended through to 2013. The stand is a cantilever, single-tiered, all-seated stand, that can hold up to 8,000 supporters. The Jarrold Stand is "unusual in having not one, but three separate television gantries suspended beneath its largely perspex roof."
In 2005, further work was undertaken on the stand and it reopened in 2006. The stand now extends around the Norwich and Peterborough Stand corner of the ground.
Accommodation for visiting supporters is provided in the end of the Jarrold Stand closest to The Barclay. 
The corner infill between the Jarrold and Norwich & Peterborough stands is called the Aviva Community Stand, which was originally built in 2005 and named after sponsors Norwich Union. It seats up to 1,500 fans and also provides extensive facilities for disabled supporters.
The club had two options on how to fill the corner between the Barclay and the Jarrold Stand. The club decided not to fill this corner with seats, as this would lead to away supporters being surrounded by home fans.
It was therefore decided to complete the ground's corners with a hotel. It was hoped that a hotel could offer greater financial rewards than ticket sales. In 2005, a contract was signed with the Holiday Inn hotel chain in 2005, and construction commenced in 2006. The hotel opened in 2007 and allows customers with pitch-facing rooms to watch matches.
Catering at Carrow Road is provided by Delia's Canary Catering, which is part of Norwich City Football Club PLC. The service is described: "All menus are made up from Delia Smith's own published recipes (6,000 in all) and as we are situated in an agricultural area we take pride in using the finest ingredients and local seasonal produce."
Yellows is a "New York-style diner" in the Norwich & Peterborough Stand. Earlier restaurants in the same place were called 'Strikers' and 'Scores'.
Delia's Restaurant and Bar is a restaurant in the Norwich & Peterborough Stand.
The Gunn Club is a catering facility behind The Barclay. With access restricted to members and season-ticket holders, "The Gunn Club" offers a slightly more up-market catering experience, available for hire on non-match days. The club offers facilities and features including video screens, appearances by current and former club members and (by popular demand) real ale.
The 68-page match programme for Norwich City matches costs £3.
The club have, in the past, stated that they have plans to increase the capacity of the stadium should the club win promotion back to the Premier League, using the increase in funds to finance the expansion. Specifically, these plans include building a second tier on the Jarrold Stand or the Geoffrey Watling City Stand. The club have stated that the Geoffrey Watling stand has foundations designed to support a second tier, and that the roof can be removed and replaced after a second tier is added. At the time the original stand was built the inner ring road ran next to the ground, and any extensions of an upper tier outside the existing footprint of the stand would have caused planning difficulties. Since the road was re-routed in the late 1990s an extension to the stand is less likely to raise planning objections.
Carrow Road has never hosted a match involving the England national football team, but the England national under-21 football team has played at the stadium on three occasions. The first was in 1983 in a UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualifying match against Denmark national under-21 football team, which England won 4-1. The team played another qualifying match in the same tournament at the stadium in 1997, beating Greece national under-21 football team 4-2. This game saw Michael Owen's only ever appearance for the England Under-21 side, before his subsequent rise to fame in the senior national team. As part of their preparations for the 2007 finals of the European Championship tournament, the England Under-21s played Slovakia national under-21 football team in a friendly match at the ground in June 2007. England won 5-0 in front of a crowd of 20,193 people.
Games involving the England Under-19 team and the full England women's national football team have also been played at the stadium. The women's team have played there on two occasions; the first a 1-0 defeat to Nigeria women's national football team in 2002, in front of 8,000 fans, and the second a 1-0 victory over Iceland national women's football team in 2006. The latter game's attendance of 9,616 was the largest crowd that had watched a friendly game involving the women's team.
The stadium has also occasionally hosted music concerts. Status Quo played a concert there in 1997. Elton John, supported by Lulu, appeared at the venue in 2005, performing what was at the time the largest concert ever to have been staged in Norwich. George Michael gave a performance there on June 12 2007, supported by Sophie Ellis-Bextor. The John and Michael concerts both attracted crowds of over 20,000 people. Andrew Cullen, the director of sales and marketing for the Carrow Road ground, told BBC Radio Norfolk prior to the George Michael performance that he hoped such concerts would become an annual summer event for the venue, if big enough star names could be attracted.

Saint Germaine

Sainte Germaine lived from 1579 to 1601. She was born in a village in France called Pibrac, which is about ten miles from Toulouse, France. 
She was born with a disfigured hand and a disease called scrofula. When she was a baby, her mother died. Germaine's father married again, but she was cruel to Germaine. Germaine's stepmother did not want the other children to contract scrofula, so she talked her husband into keeping Germaine away from the house. When she was very young she started to be a shepherdess. At night she slept in the stable or on vine branches in a roof space. In early ages she learned to practice humility and patience. She was not lonely because she had a gift with a sense of presence of God and other spiritual things. Her daily food was bread and water. She loved Jesus and the Blessed Virgin Mary. She went to church every day. When she heard the church bell ring, she fixed her staff on the ground and left the sheep in the care of Jesus while she was in mass. Even though the flock was near a forest filled with wolves, the sheep were never harmed. After heavy rains or the snow melted, it was hard to cross to go to church. Her only book was the Rosary, and she had great devotion to the Angelus. Several times people saw the water make a passageway for Germaine to cross without wetting her cloths. She helped the poor by sharing her bread with them. One day Germaine's father forbade her wife to treat Germaine cruelly, and gave Germaine a place in the house. Germaine begged to be allowed to keep her humbler way of life. Now, when everyone began to realize Germaine's holiness, she died. She had not awoken at her usual hour one early summer morning of 1601, so her father went to look for her. He found her dead on the vine branches. She was 22 years old. She was buried in front of the stand in the Church of Pibrac.

Kricogonia lyside

The Lyside Sulphur or Guayacan Sulphur (Kricogonia lyside) is a North American and South American butterfly. It is in the family Pieridae. In seasons with heavy monsoons, this butterfly is seen in large migrations. These migrations are common in Texas. They are less common in the southwest. It sometimes lives in southern Florida.
The coloring of the Lyside Sulphur . The upper side of the wings is pale yellow. It usually has a black bar on the top edge of the hind wing (the bottom wing). There is normally a bright yellow patch near the base (where the wing connects to the body) of the fore wing (the top wing). Some individuals also have black borders along the top edges of the fore wing. The underside of the wings varies. They vary from a greenish color to bright yellow to almost white. Greener individuals have a whitish vein in the center of the hind wing. The fore wing has a bright yellow basal patch. The wingspan is 1.5 to 2.38 in. (3.8 to 6 cm.).
Similar species in the Lyside Sulphur's range include Queen Alexandra's Sulphur ("Colias alexandra"), the Cloudless Sulphur ("Phoebis sennae"), and the Statira Sulphur ("Phoebis statira").
Queen Alexandra's Sulphur has more yellow on the underside of the fore wing. It has a whitish spot in the center of the hind wing.
The Cloudless Sulphur is larger. It is much more yellow.
The Statira Sulphur has a more yellowish upper side. The underside of the wings is pale greenish to white. Females have light pinkish markings.
This butterfly is seen almost all year in southern Texas. It is seen from early July to mid November in Arizona. In Florida, there have been scattered sightings from July to October.
The Lyside Sulphur may be found in open, subtropical scrub habitats.
The caterpillar varies often. It's varies from green to blackish-green. It may have markings or may not have markings. Marked individuals normally have stripes on the top and sides of their bodies. It is the only caterpillar to feed on "Guaiacum sanctum". The chrysalis is a bluish-green color. The Lyside Sulphur can grow from egg to adult in as little as 13 days. It has 3 or more broods per year in southern Texas.
Here is a list of host plants that the Lyside Sulphur caterpillar eats:

Hello all,
I am starting a new thread here (as the one above is already getting lengthy). I am writing this without the recent closure (see above) in mind; these comments are just "general". They are not meant to favor certain users, or to accuse others. Some time ago, there were just two or three Bureaucrats, Vector, Creol and later me. Vector is still around, Creol has since left the project. At that time we had fewer users, and it was frequent that the bureaucrat who closed, also voted in the RfA. Later on, we "silently agreed" that if possible the person who votes does not close, if it can be avoided. This is however no "tight rule", I think all our bureaucrats are capable of judging an RfA, even if they voted in it - Voting is expressing one's opinion, closing involves judging what the community wants. It may well be that a bureaucrat has a certain opinion about a candidate, but as he sees what certain people wrote, he closes completely differently to his opinion. 
All our bureaucrats -- me included --were hand-picked by the community, to take decisions in RfAs. They are legitimised by the election. It is not possible to elect someone to do a certain task, and then question them every time they exercise this task; this is counterproductive, as anyone can see. We are currently discussing a crat decision, but we should rather spend our time writing articles or improving this Wikipedia.
As a last note: If anyone thinks that some of our crats cannot be trusted in their decisions, please say so. This community can also have the crat flag (or any other flag) taken away. But otherwise, please stop arguing about a crat decision. It is unproductive, and only takes time we could otherwise spend improving this Wikipedia.-- () 11:01, 25 October 2009 (UTC)

The following is from his last 1,000 contributions in all namespaces & works in back-chronological order (now → then). Along with the ones Barras mentioned, there's this one. Click along a few Newer edit → links, and you find this. The previous :| comes in a set of three; this one is iffy; this one involves inferred swearing; and this one is a thinly veiled attack on a couple of s. The first one I found, however, here, is lighthearted, and I have no problem with it. (Endorse block.) 
Bluegoblin7 has, without prompting, issued a statement about recent events. Since he is unable to post it in a more public place, I offer it's location here"(diff)". It does not affect the block, however it is nice to hear. 23:53, 2 November 2009 (UTC)
In light of and response to his statement, I'd like to officially propose reducing BG7's block. It's clear to me that he's learned his lesson, and whilst there are no excuses for incivility and failure to AGF, I don't think maintaining this block will prevent damage from the encyclopedia—indeed, I think the block itself is currently doing more harm that it's preventing. I think lowering the block to 48 hours on the condition that any further disruptive activity will result in an immediate re-instating of the previous block time is therefore appropriate. – |  00:35, 3 November 2009 (UTC)
Well I'm pretty sure you can guess my stance before I've even said it. BG7 is one of the most constructive users here, he continues to edit constructively, and a few little blips (okay, rather large blips) should not cloud this. I support reducing the block at the least. 19:25, 3 November 2009 (UTC)
The IP 114.78.135.76 has been constantly vandalising Wikipedia. He has been given a final warning, but vandalised the page 'Bushfire'. I am proposing a temporary block to stop him vandalising even more. () 09:42, 8 November 2009 (UTC)
Hey guys. I was just looking at a user talk page archive and I found an admin that I have never seen before. . Per the edit counter he has made one edit in the last year, coming in December of 2008, and has not used his bit since April of 2008 well over a year ago. I think this all correct, let me know if I am wrong. I was wondering since it has been over a year since his last logged action, should we be putting him up for de-syops?-- |  00:29, 8 November 2009 (UTC)
Since we now have a policy for desysoping inactive admins, is useless now it would seem. The definition in the policy says that he is "not" inactive. This should probably be closed since it goes against our policy and process as set out in . () 13:31, 8 November 2009 (UTC)

Patau syndrome

Patau Sydrome, also known as Trisomy 13 or Trisomy D is a problem with the chromosomes. People who suffer from it have an extra copy of chromosome 13. This is usually because of a problem that occurred during meiosis, but it can also be the result of Robertsonian translocation, a common rearrangement of chromosomes in humans. The risk of getting a problem during meiosis increases when women have babies later in life. The average age for this syndrome is at 31 years.
It is the rarest of the three common trisomies. Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome are more common. Patau syndrome affects about one in 25,000 live births.

Immunosuppressant drugs are simply drugs which suppress the immune system. In other words, they reduce the effect of the tiny germs that protect your body from dangerous germs. This makes the body open to disease but it is useful in other ways:
When someone receives an organ transplant, the body thinks the new organ is dangerous and tries to get rid of it. This is called organ rejection. If immunosuppressant drugs are taken the body usually accepts the new organ.

Deodoro da Fonseca

Marshal Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca (Alagoas City, August 5, 1827 - Rio de Janeiro, August 23, 1892) was the first president of the Republic of Brazil and he reached this position after a military strategy that put down the Emperor Pedro II.
Son of Manuel Mendes da Fonseca (1785-1859) and Rosa Maria Paulina da Fonseca (1802-1873). His father was also a soldier and belonged to the Conservative Party. He had two sisters and seven brothers and three of them died in the Paraguay War: Afonso Aurélio da Fonseca (the youngest), ensign of the 34º Voluntários da Pátria Battalion; captain Hipólito Mendes da Fonseca, dead in the Battle of Curupaity; and major Eduardo Emiliano da Fonseca, dead in the Battle of Itororó.
His elder brother, Hermes Ernesto da Fonseca, father of Hermes da Fonseca, was a marshal in the Brazilian Army, president of Mato Grosso province, governor of Bahia province and commander-in-chief in Bahia and Pará provinces.
Two other brothers also had brilliant military and political careers: Severiano Martins da Fonseca, who reached the rank of field marshal, received the noble title of "Barão de Alagoas" (Baron of Alagoas) and was the director of the Military School of Porto Alegre; and Pedro Paulino da Fonseca, who was an honorary colonel of the Brazilian Army, head of government of Alagoas and Senator of the Republic for the same Brazilian state.
In 1843, at the age of sixteen, Deodoro enrolled himself in the Rio de Janeiro Military Academy and finished the artillery course in 1847. In 1845, he was already a 1 class cadet. In 1848, he took part in his first military action, helping to repress the Praieira Revolt, an insurrection promoted by the Liberal Party of Pernambuco.
He got married when he was 33 years old, on April 6, 1860, to Mariana Cecília de Sousa Meireles, who was considered by biographers a very well educated woman, religious, modest and full of domestic attributes. They did not have any children. His nephew Hermes da Fonseca, who also reached the Brazilian presidency, was treated like a son by Deodoro.

The astrolabe is a tool using the positions of the stars or sun. It was formerly used in navigation to help explorers and sailors figure out where they were. They found their the distance north and south of the equator by measuring the distance of the sun and stars above the horizon. Astronomers used other kinds of astrolabes, usually larger ones.
An early astrolabe was made in the Hellenistic world in 150 BC. It is often attributed to Hipparchus. The astrolabe was a marriage of the planisphere (a star chart analog computing instrument) and dioptra (a tool to measure angles). It was a calculator able to work out many kinds of problems in astronomy. Theon of Alexandria wrote a complex book on the astrolabe. Lewis says that Ptolemy used an astrolabe to make the astronomy observations recorded in the "Tetrabiblos".

Der Rosenkavalier

Der Rosenkavalier (in English: The Knight of the Rose) is a comic opera by Richard Strauss. The words (libretto) were especially written for the opera by the German poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal.
It was first performed in Dresden on 26 January 1911 and was an immediate success. It continues to be a very popular opera in opera houses all over the world and has been performed more often than any other German language 20th century opera.
The story is supposed to be happening in Vienna in the time of the Empress Maria Theresa (mid to late 18th century). The music and the words deliberately show the elegant life of aristocratic society of that time. For example: the title of the opera is about the silver rose which traditionally was sent by a bridegroom to his bride and was brought by a knight (the Knight of the Rose).
Act I takes place in the Marschallin’s bedroom. The Marschallin is an aristocratic lady aged 32. She has a lover, a young boy aged 17 called Octavian. When the opera starts, we first hear an orchestral prologue. The music suggests that the Marschallin and Octavian are making love. Then the curtain opens and we see the two together. They hear a noise and the Marschallin thinks her husband is coming, so Octavian hides. It is not her husband, but her cousin Baron Ochs. Ochs is a very rude man with bad manners. He marches in to the Marschallin’s room although the servants had asked him to wait. Octavian manages to change his clothes and appears dressed as a maid called Mariandel. Ochs thinks “she” is pretty and wants “her” to meet him. Then he tells the Marschallin what he has come for: he wants a young knight to deliver the silver rose to his bride Sophie. He also needs a notary to sign the legal documents of the wedding. Ochs sings about the fun of making love. He wishes he were like Jupiter who was able to disguise himself in many ways.
The morning levée begins. This means: the ceremony of the Marschallin getting up. Several people come in. They include: an Italian tenor who sings an aria, two Italian people called Valzacchi and Annina, who are always spreading gossip, and a notary. When the notary tells Ochs that he needs to pay a dowry to his bride, not the other way round, Ochs is very angry.
When the Marschallin is left alone she sings a song about how she is losing her youthful looks. Octavian returns and cheers her up a bit, but she feels sad when he says goodbye very politely and formally, not even kissing her. The Marschallin sends her little black pageboy to run after him with the silver rose.
The story continues in the large room of the house of Herr von Faninal, the father of Sophie whom Ochs wants to marry. Sophie is waiting for the silver rose to arrive (the convention of the time says that her father must not be there). Octavian enters and gives her the rose. The music at this moment is very beautiful and very famous. The people in the room are talking, then Baron Ochs enters rudely. Sophie is shocked about his bad manners. Ochs hums his favourite waltz, then goes to the next room to sign a marriage contract. Sophie sinks into Octavian’s arms. When Ochs comes back Octavian tells him Sophie does not want him, but Ochs will not listen. Eventually Ochs takes his sword and starts to fight Octavian, who wounds Ochs slightly. Ochs is furious, but calms down a little after he is given some wine.
Octavian has fallen in love with Sophie, and Sophie with him. He wants to use Valzacchi and Annina to help him with a plan. He writes a note to Ochs, which is supposed to be from the maid Mariandel, asking him to meet her. He gets Annina to take the note to Ochs, who is delighted when he reads it. He sings his favourite waltz.
The scene is an inn near Vienna. Valzacchi and Annina now work both for Octavian and for Ochs. They prefer working for Octavian because he pays them more money. They are planning tricks on Ochs. 
Ochs meets Mariandel (Octavian dressed up as the maid again). He tries to get "her" drunk, but "she" shyly sings “Nein, nein! i’ trink kein Wein.” (“No, no, I don’t drink wine”). Ochs thinks "she" looks like Octavian. Then strange figures of people appear at a window. Then Annina comes in and says she is Ochs’s wife whom he has deserted. Then some children come in and say that Ochs is their father. Ochs is very embarrassed when Faninal comes in and says Mariandel is his fiancée. He tells the people he has never seen Faninal before. Then the Marschallin appears and also the police. The evening is a disaster for Ochs. The Marschallin tells the police it is just a joke. She sends Ochs away.
The Marschallin, Sophie and Octavian sing a beautiful trio (using some of the music from the song “Nein, nein, i’ trink kein Wein”). Octavian is forgiven. He is left alone with Sophie and they sing a duet together, then go off hand in hand. She has left a handkerchief on the floor. The little black pageboy picks it up and runs after them.
The language used by Hofmannsthal changes according to who is speaking. The members of the nobility speak in very elegant language which is often old-fashioned and always very polite. When good friends speak to one another they often use the familiar ("du") (“you” when used between very close friends). For example: Octavian and the Marschallin often use the familiar "you" but sometimes use ("Sie") when they are being more formal.
Baron Ochs is always showing off and the words he uses show this. When Octavian pretends to be the maid Mariandel he speaks in an Austrian dialect. Valzacchi and Annina also speak in a dialect, but their German is not perfect and often mixed with Italian. 
All this makes it particularly difficult to sing the opera in any other language.

Mick Taylor

Michael Kevin "Mick" Taylor (born 17 January 1949) is an English musician best known as a former member of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers and The Rolling Stones. He is well known for his skills as a "slide guitar" player. He also plays piano, bass and drums.
Taylor was born in Welwyn Garden City. He was raised in Hatfield.
He formed his first band "The Gods" in 1965. He played together with Ken Hensley (later with Uriah Heep). Other musicians were Greg Lake (later with Emerson, Lake and Palmer) and John Glascock. 1966 he left the band and joined John Mayall´s Bluesbreakers. He replaced there Peter Green. In June 1969 the Rolling Stones looked for a new guitarist and they found Mick Taylor. His first gig as band member of the Stones was the concert in Hyde Park on 5 July 1969 . The concert was in memory of the late Brian Jones.
Like Bill Wyman he was never the show man on stage. Due to Richards drug problem he did a lot of guitar work for the albums. Jagger and Taylor recorded "Sway", "Moonlight Mile", "Winter", "Till the Next Goodbye" and "Time Waits For No One". But Taylor never earned money for this work. As Richards critizied his guitar playing he decided in December 1974 to leave the Stones.
Taylor's onstage presence with the Rolling Stones is preserved on the album "Get Yer Ya-Yas Out!", recorded in New York and Boston in November 1969; in the documentary films "Stones in the Park" (released on DVD in 2001), "Gimme Shelter" (released in 1970) and "Cocksucker Blues" (unreleased); and in the concert film "" (shown in cinemas in 1974). Bootleg recordings from the Rolling Stones' tours from 1969 through 1973 also document Taylor's concert performances with the Rolling Stones.
Compared to the Rolling Stones time his solo career was not very successful. After leaving the Stones he formed together with Jack Bruce, Carla Bley and Bruce Gary the Jack Bruce Band. The project failed due to musical differences between Bruce and Taylor. But despite the split Taylor was often guitar player on solo projects of Rolling Stones members. For example he played om Richards album "Talk is cheap" from 1988. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Mick Taylor along with the Rolling Stones in 1989.In the early 1990s he played for Bill Wyman´s Rhythm Kings.
Non-Rolling Stones work with Rolling Stones members:
released on CD (A& M - Japan, 2002)
Originally released by Alpha Music in 1996, this "Mick Taylor featuring Sasha" album should have read "Sasha featuring Mick Taylor", but the company felt it would sell better under a household name. It features Mick Taylor on guitar, but is basically a Sasha Gracanin album.

Pedro II of Brazil

Don Pedro II of Brazil (complete name: "Pedro de Alcântara João Carlos Leopoldo Salvador Bibiano Francisco Xavier de Paula Leocádio Miguel Gabriel Rafael Gonzaga"; Rio de Janeiro, December 2, 1825 — Paris, December 5, 1891), known as "O Magnânimo" ("The Magnanimous"), was the second and last de facto Brazilian Emperor. He was the seventh son of Pedro I and the archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria. Pedro II succeeded his father in the Brazilian Throne when he was 16 years of age. Pedro I had to return to Portugal in order to rule over the country as an Emperor and this action made him abdicate from the Brazilian Throne in favor of his son. But, when in Portugal, Pedro I renounced the Portuguese Throne, in favor of his eldest daughter Dona Maria da Glória.
Pedro II was nephew of Miguel I (father's part), Napoleon Bonaparte (mother's part) and cousin of Emperors Napoleon II, Franz Joseph I and Maximilian I of Mexico. He was Maria da Glória's youngst brother and uncle of kings Pedro V and Luís I.

Since the Bhola cyclone killed from 300,000 to 500,000 people, the Bhola cyclone holds the world record as the deadliest storm. Most of the people that were killed, were killed in East Pakistan (Bangladesh), because of the storm surge that caused flooding.

Snake River Plain

The Snake River Plain is a valley in the U.S. state of Idaho. It covers most of the southern part of the state and is transected by the Snake River. The Snake River Plain was formed by magma rising up below the North American Plate. As the plate moved westward, the magma melted rock under the plate. This melting caused the surface to drop and form the Snake River Plain. Underneath the plain is the Snake River Aquifer. The aquifer is fed by the Snake River and its tributaries. Much of the soil in the Snake River Plain is fertile. As a result, today the primary human purpose of the plain is for agriculture.

Wijerd Jelckama

Wijerd Jelckama (1490 – July 7 1523) was a Frisian freedom fighter, legendary warrior, warlord, rebel and pirate.
Jelckama was born in the year 1490 in a large family of farmers and petty noblemen. He was descended from knights who had participated in the Crusades. One of his ancestors from his father's side of the family had died at the Siege of Antioch.
Jelckama was married to a woman by the name of Fokel, the exact year of their marriage is unknown. She survived for longer than her husband but died in 1553. They had two daughters and a son. Their son was named Janco Douwes Jelckama (1514-1587)and their daughters were named Bonga (1516-1575) and Fokel (1517-1546).
Grandchildren and great-grandchildren of Jelckama are known.
A great-granddaughter who died in 1625 probably ended Jelckama's official bloodline.
Together with Pier Gerlofs Donia, Jelckama fought against the Saxon warriors that occupied their homeland of Frisia, at the capture of Medemblik, and in the siege of Middelburg castle.
Jelckama served as Donia's lieutenant for the first five years. After Donia had died in 1520, Jelckama took over the command of the armies. He had been the commander of the Arumer Black Heap and the main leader of the Frisian rebellion against the House of Habsburg since as early as 1519.
Author Wopke Eekhoff described Jelckama as being as sturdy as his giant uncle, who was himself reportedly at least 7 feet tall and once lifted a 1000-pound horse above his head.
Jelckama himself was strong enough to lift a horse over his shoulders high up in the air. His height is documented at 7 feet.
After a series of defeats, he and what was left of the Frisian army were captured in 1523 and taken to the city of Leeuwarden in Frisia. There they were executed. The execution took place in public. It took the executioner four blows to sever Jelckama's head from his extremely thick neck.
With the death of Jelckama and the rebels, the independence of Frisia came to an end. It was the last successful revolt in Frisian history and is remembered as such to this day.

Chronic stress

Chronic stress is stress that happens over a long period of time. It is different than acute stress, which happens over a short period of time and then goes away. 
Stress is a normal part of every living thing's daily life. However, when stress becomes chronic, it can damage the body and the mind. When a person (or animal) is stressed, the body reacts in certain ways - for example, by releasing chemicals called corticosteroids. If this happens again and again, over a long period of time, it can change the way the brain works. These changes can damage working memory spatial memory, and decision-making skills. They can also increase aggression.
Chronic stress can cause (or worsen) many different medical problems. For example, people who have had chronic stress are more likely to get hypertension (high blood pressure) and heart disease.

The Pieridae are a large family of butterflies. They are known as Whites, Yellows, or Sulphurs. This family has about 76 genera and 1,100 species. They are mostly from tropical Africa and Asia. Most pierid butterflies are white, yellow or orange with black spots. The pigments that give the coloring to these butterflies are derived from waste products in the body. They are a characteristic of this family. 
It is believed that the name "butterfly" originated from a member of this family, the Brimstone "Gonepteryx rhamni". It was called the "butter-coloured fly" by early British naturalists. 
The sexes are usually different, often in the pattern or number of black markings.
The caterpillars of a few of these species, such as "Pieris brassicae" and "Pieris rapae", feed on brassicas. They are commonly seen in gardens and are agricultural pests.
Males of many species feed on salts from moist soil. They do this in groups. This behavior is known as mud-puddling or puddling.
The Pieridae have the radial vein on the forewing with 3 or 4 branches and rarely with 5 branches. The fore legs are well developed in both sexes. The tarsal claws are bifid (bifid means split into two parts).
Like the Papilionidae, Pieridae also have their chrysalids held at an angle by a silk girdle. The girdle runs around the first abdominal segment unlike the thoracic girdle seen in the Papilionidae.
The Pieridae are divided into the following four subfamilies:

Woodcut

A woodcut is a way of printing. An image is cut into a block of wood. The printing part remains level with the surface. The non-printing parts are removed, often with a tool called a gouge. The areas that are 'white' are cut away with a knife or chisel. Therefore the wood still at the original surface level are black in the final print.
The wood block is cut in the direction of the grain of the wood. In Europe beechwood was most commonly used. In Japan, a special type of cherry wood was used.
The surface is covered with ink. It is rolled over the surface with an ink-covered roller (called a brayer). This leaves ink upon the flat surface, but none in the non-printing areas. Sometimes woodcuts are referred to by a formal word, xylography.

Blood Brothers is a musical. Book, lyrics, and music were written by Willy Russel. It is one of the longest running musicals in history, with the performance running since its original 1988 West End production. It opened on Broadway on 25 April 1993 at the Music Box Theatre. It closed on 30 April 1995 after 840 performances.
The musical has a main theme of nature vs. nurture; where two twins have been separated at birth. The twins different backgrounds are shown through class,wealth and social status. This continues showing the extremes in British society by one twin becoming an University graduate and the other being stuck with money and home problems. Both fall in love with the same girl, Linda, and end up dying on the same day. As the narrator tells you at the start of the performance.
Over the years the musical has been changed to suit the director. Some changes are that:

Peterloo Massacre

The Peterloo Massacre (or Battle of Peterloo) happened at St Peter's Field, Manchester, England, on 16 August 1819. It was when cavalry charged into a crowd of 60,000 to 80,000 gathered at a meeting to demand the reform of parliamentary representation.
The end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had resulted in a time of famine and chronic unemployment. This was exacerbated by the introduction of the first of the Corn Laws. By the beginning of 1819 the pressure generated by poor economic conditions and the lack of suffrage in northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism. In response, the Manchester Patriotic Union organised a demonstration to be addressed by the radical orator Henry Hunt. The Manchester Patriotic Union was a group agitating for parliamentary reform.
Shortly after the meeting began, local magistrates called on the military authorities to arrest Henry Hunt and several others with him, and to the men. Cavalry charged into the crowd with sabres drawn. In the resulting confusion, 15 people were killed and 400 to 700 were injured. The massacre was given the name Peterloo in ironic comparison to the Battle of Waterloo, which had taken place four years earlier.

Richard Arkwright

Sir Richard Arkwright (3 January 1733 – 3 August 1792) was an Englishman who invented the spinning frame – later renamed the water frame following the transition to water power. A self-made man, he was a leading entrepreneur of the Industrial Revolution in England. Arkwright's achievement was to combine power, machinery, semi-skilled labour, and a new raw material (cotton) to create, more than a century before Henry Ford, mass production. His mechanical abilities and, above all, his genius for organisation made him more than anyone else, the creator of the modern factory system.
Arkwright was born in Preston, Lancashire, England and died in Cromford, Derbyshire at the age of 59.

Port of Manchester

The Port of Manchester is in the north west of England. It was created as a customs port on 1 January 1894. This was four months before the opening of the Manchester Ship Canal transformed Manchester from a landlocked city into a major sea port. It extended along the whole 36 miles length of the canal, from Eastham in the west to Manchester in the east, absorbing the Port of Runcorn, which had been created in 1862. The creation of the new port moved the Port of Liverpool's boundary 11 milles to the west. Once delivered to the port, goods travelled as far west as Warrington, about 20 miles north, as far east as Leeds, and up to 100 miles south to Birmingham.

<doc id="210064" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210064" title="Rotifer">
Rotifer

The rotifers are a phylum of tiny animals which are common in freshwater environments, such as ponds and puddles. Some rotifers are free swimming, others move by inching along, and some are fixed. A few species live in colonies. 
Rotifers were first described when early microscopes became available, around 1700. They are an important part of the freshwater zooplankton. Also, many species help decompose organic matter in soil. Rotifers eat fish waste, dead bacteria, and algae. They eat particles up to 10 micrometres in size. A rotifer filters 100,000 times its own volume of water per hour. They are used in fish tanks to help clean the water, to prevent clouds of waste matter.
About 2200 species of rotifers have been described. They are placed in the phylum Rotifera. This phylum is subdivided into three classes, "Monogononta", "Bdelloidea", and "Seisonidea". The largest group is the Monogononta, with about 1500 species, followed by the Bdelloidea, with about 350 species. There are only two known species of Seisonidea.
Fossils of the species "Habrotrocha angusticollis" have been found in 6000 year old Pleistocene peat deposits. The oldest known fossil rotifers have been found in Eocene Dominican amber.
The front has a ring of cilia circling the mouth. This gave the rotifers their old name of "wheel animalules". There is a protective "lorica" round its body, and a foot. Inside the lorica are the usual organs in miniturised form: a brain, an eye-spot, jaws, stomach, kidneys, urinary bladder.
Rotifers have a number of unusual features. Biologists suppose that these peculiarities are adaptations to their small size and the transient (fast changing) nature of its habitats.
Rotifers are specialists at living in habitats where water dries up regularly. 
The Monogononta, which have males, produce fertilised 'resting eggs' which can resist desiccation (drought) for long periods. 
The Bdelloids, who have no males, contract into an inert form and lose almost all body water, a process known as "cryptobiosis". Bdelloids can also survive the dry state for long periods: the longest well-documented dormancy is nine years. After they have dried, they may be revived by adding water. In this, and several other ways, they are a unique group of animals.
Rotifers are hatched with a standard number of cell nuclei, exactly the same number for every rotifer in a species. This is called "eutely". No cell division whatsoever takes place during adult life. Not only that, but the number of nuclei in each tissue is constant. Furthermore, most of the nuclei do not have cell walls: rotifer tissue is largely or wholly a syncytium.
The absence of cell division is probably one reason they are extraordinarily resistant to ionising radiation. Also, repairing DNA is one of the things they are known to do after desiccation.
In one of the classes, the freshwater Bdelloid rotifers, "no males have ever been seen". It is the largest group of wholly parthenogenetic species in the Animalia. 
The females in this group produce eggs by parthenogenesis (virgin birth). In some species these eggs develop into small juveniles before they are released from their parent. The offspring are "clones" of their mother. 
Cytological and molecular genetic studies show that bdelloids evolved from a common ancestor which lost sexual recombination (meiosis and fertilisation) about 100 million years ago. Research has also been done on the implications of parthenogenesis for speciation.
Bdelloid rotifer genomes contain two or more non-identical copies of each gene. This suggests their asexual reproduction is of long standing. For example, there are four copies of gene "hsp82". Each is different and on a different chromosome. This cannot be explaned by normal gene duplication, which produces two or more near-identical genes next to each other. By contrast, in a monogont rotifer, most genes were single-copy. 
There are genes in bdelloid rotifers that seem to have come from bacteria, fungi, and plants. This suggests they arrived by horizontal gene transfer. The capture and use of exogenous (~foreign) genes seems to be important in bdelloid evolution. The team led by Matthew S. Meselson at Harvard University showed that, despite the lack of sexual reproduction, bdelloid rotifers do engage in genetic (DNA) transfer within a species or clade. The method used is not known at present.
The Acanthocephala, a group of parasitic worms previously considered to be a separate phylum, have been shown to be modified rotifers. The exact relationship to the normal, freeliving, members of the phylum is not resolved.

Estigmene acrea

The Salt Marsh Moth or Acrea Moth ("Estigmene acrea") is a North American moth. It is in the family Arctiidae. The caterpillar is known as the Salt Marsh Caterpillar.
The head and thorax are white. The abdomen is yellow-orange with a row of black spots. The fore wing (the top wing) is white with a variable amount of black spots (some individuals do not have these spots). The hind wing (the bottom wing) is yellow-orange in males. It is white in females. Both sexes have 3-4 black spots or blotches on their hind wings. The wingspan ranges from 4.5 to 6.8 cm.
This moth may be seen from May to August. It is seen all year in southern Florida and southern Texas.
The eggs are a yellowish color. They are laid in clusters on the host plant leaves. The Salt Marsh Caterpillar is highly variable in color. It ranges from pale yellow to dark brownish-black. It has many soft hairs. The hairs are longer towards the end of the body. The thoracic and abdominal segments have a few rows of either orange or black warts. The chrysalis hibernates in a cocoon.
Here is a list of host plants that the Salt Marsh Caterpillar feeds on:

Führerbunker

The Führerbunker (German, literally meaning "shelter for the leader" or "the Führer's shelter") was under Hitler's New Reich Chancellery in Berlin, Germany. It was in this subterranean bunker where Adolf Hitler and his wife Eva Braun spent the last weeks of the war. Both died there on April 30, 1945. 
The elaborate complex consisted of two separate levels, the "Vorbunker" (the upper bunker) or "forward bunker" and the newer Führerbunker one level below. They were both connected together by a stairway set at right angles (they were not spiral). The Führerbunker was about 8.2 meters beneath the garden of the old Reich Chancellery building at Wilhelmstraße 77. This is about 120 meters north of the new Reich Chancellery building, which had the address Voßstraße 6. The Vorbunker was under the large hall behind the old Reich Chancellery. It was connected to the new Reich Chancellery. The Führerbunker was somewhat lower than the Vorbunker and in the west of it. The two bunkers were connected via sets of stairs set at right angles.
The complex was protected by circa four meters of concrete, and about 30 small rooms were distributed over two levels with exits into the main buildings and an emergency exit into the garden. The complex was built in two distinct phases, one part in 1936 and the other in 1943. The 1943 development was built by the Hochtief company as part of an extensive program of subterranean construction in Berlin that begun in 1940. The rooms of Hitler were in the newer, lower section and by February 1945 had been appointed with high quality furniture taken from the Chancellery along with several framed oil paintings.

<doc id="210168" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210168" title="Typhoon Tip">
Typhoon Tip

Typhoon Tip (international designation: 7920, JTWC designation: 23W) was the biggest and strongest known tropical cyclone on record. It was the 19th tropical storm and 12th typhoon of the 1979 Pacific typhoon season. The typhoon formed out of a disturbance in a monsoon trough on October 4 near Pohnpei. At first, a tropical storm to the northwest prevented Tip from strengthening, but after it moved further north, the storm was able to gain more strength. After passing near Guam, it strengthened quickly and reached its highest winds of 305 km/h (190 mph) and a worldwide record low barometric pressure of 870 mbar (hPa, 25.69 inHg) on October 12. At its peak strength, it was also the biggest tropical cyclone on record, with a diameter of 2,220 km (1,380 mi). Tip slowly weakened as it kept moving towards the west-northwest, and later turned to the northeast. Tip made landfall on southern Japan on October 19, and became an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter.
U.S. Air Force Reconnaissance flew into the typhoon on 60 different times, making Tip one of the most closely watched tropical cyclones. Rainfall from the storm breached a wall that was used to stop flooding at a United States Marine Corps training camp in the Kanagawa Prefecture of Japan. This eventually led to a fire which killed 13 Marines and hurt 68. Elsewhere in the country, the typhoon caused lots of damage and 42 deaths and shipwrecks left another 44 killed or missing.
Three low pressure areas formed the monsoon trough that extended from the Philippines to the Marshall Islands. An area of disturbed weather to the southwest of Guam eventually strengthened into Tropical Storm Roger on October 3. Later on the same day, the tropical system which would later become Typhoon Tip formed to the south of Pohnpei. Because Roger was so close, the storm that would become Tip was not able to strengthen much. However, it gradually organized as it moved towards the west. The tropical disturbance moved slowly and and slowly made a loop to the southeast of Chuuk. A Reconnaissance Aircraft flight into the system late on October 4 confirmed the existence of a circulation center. A bit later, on October 5, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) called the system Tropical Depression Twenty-Three.
The tropical depression into Tropical Storm Tip, but it did not organize significantly due to Tropical Storm Roger being so close. After moving slowly for many days, Tip began a steady northwest path on October 8. By that time, Tropical Storm Roger had become an extratropical cyclone. At first, the storm was expected to continue moving northwestward and hit Guam. However, early on October 9, it turned to the west, passing about 45 km (28 mi) south of the island. Later that day, Tip reached typhoon strength.
As a result of certain weather conditions, Typhoon Tip quickly strengthened in the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. Late on October 10, the typhoon reached Category 4 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and the next day it became a "super typhoon". The central pressure dropped 92 mbar (hPa, 2.71 inHg) from October 9 to 11. During this time, the typhoon became extremely large, reaching a record diameter of 2,220 km (1,380 mi). The typhoon continued to gain strength, and early on October 12, Reconnaissance Aircraft recorded a worldwide record-low pressure of 870 mbar (hPa, 25.69 inHg). The typhoon had winds of 305 km/h (190 mph) while located about 840 km (520 mi) west-northwest of Guam. At the time, the typhoon's eye was only 15 km (9.3 mi) wide.
After hitting its peak strength, Tip weakened to a 230 km/h (145 mph) typhoon and stayed at that intensity for several days as it moved west-northwest. For five days, 55 km/h (35 mph) winds extended over 1,100 km (685 mi) from the center. On October 17, Tip began to weaken and get much smaller. The next day, it curved towards the northeast because of a nearby trough. After passing about 65 km (45 mi) east of Okinawa, it sped up and was then moving at 75 km/h (46 mph). On October 19, Tip made landfall on the Japanese island of Honshū with winds of about 130 km/h (80 mph). The typhoon continued moving rapidly northeastward through the country, and became an extratropical cyclone over northern Honshū. What was left of the cyclone kept moving northeastward and slowly lost strength. It was last observed near Alaska.
The typhoon produced heavy rain while passing near Guam, including a total of 23.1 cm (9.09 in) an Air Force base. The outer rainbands of Tip dropped moderate rain in the mountains of the Philippines.
Heavy rainfall from the typhoon breached a wall used to stop flooding at Camp Fuji, a training camp for the United States Marine Corps near Yokosuka. Marines inside the camp during the storm stayed inside of huts near the bottom of a hill. On top of the hill was a fuel farm. The breach caused hoses to be torn from two rubber storage tanks, letting large amounts of fuel flow down the hill. The fuel was ignited by a heater used for warming a hut. This started a large fire which killed 13 Marines, hurt 68 others, and caused damage to the camp. The facility's barracks were destroyed, along with 15 huts and several other buildings. Firemen from nearby areas arrived within two hours. The barracks were rebuilt, and a memorial was created for those who lost their lives to the fire.
While passing offshore, Typhoon Tip came within 65 km (40 mi) of Okinawa. Sustained winds reached 72 km/h (44 mph), with gusts to 112 km/h (69 mph). Winds in mainland Japan are not fully known. The typhoon did many millions of dollars in damage to farming and fishing industries of the country. Eight ships were grounded or sunk by Tip, leaving 44 fishermen dead or missing. A Chinese freighter broke in half as a result of the typhoon. Its crew of 46 people was rescued. The rainfall led to over 600 mudslides across the mountains of the country flooded more than 22,000 homes. It is estimated that 42 people died, with another 71 missing and 283 hurt. Around 27 bridges were destroyed by the storm, as well as about 105 dikes. Following the storm, at least 11,000 people were left without a place to live. Transportation in the country was also affected; 200 trains and 160 domestic airline flights were canceled. Tip was called the most severe storm to strike Japan in 13 years.
Typhoon Tip was the largest tropical cyclone on record, with a diameter of 1,380 mi (2,220 km). This is almost double the previous record of 700 miles (1,130 km) set by Typhoon Marge in August of 1951. At its largest size, Tip was nearly as big as half of the United States. When Tip was at its peak strength, the temperature inside the eye of was 30° C (86° F), which is high for a tropical cyclone. Also, with 10-minute sustained winds of 160 mph (260 km/h), Typhoon Tip is the strongest cyclone in the list of tropical cyclones by the Japan Meteorological Agency.
The typhoon was also the most intense tropical cyclone in the world. It had a minimum a pressure of 870 mbar (hPa, 25.69 inHg), which is 6 mbar (hPa, 0.17 inHg) lower than previous record set by Typhoon June in 1975. The records set by Tip still exists, although because Reconnaissance Aircraft missions in the western Pacific Ocean stopped in August 1987, some people think there might be slightly stronger cyclones. Three researchers found that two typhoons, Angela in 1995 and Gay in 1992, had higher Dvorak numbers than Tip. They believe that one or both of the two may have been stronger than Typhoon Tip. Also, Cyclone Monica of 2006 was rated at 869 mb by Dvorak classifications, but this is not considered accurate data. Because of this, it is unknown if Tip still has the world record. Despite its record intensity and severe damage, the name Tip was not retired. It was then reused in 1983, 1986, and 1989.

1979 Pacific typhoon season

The 1979 Pacific typhoon season has no official limits; it ran year-round in 1979, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between June and December. 
28 tropical depressions formed this year in the Western Pacific, of which 23 became tropical storms. 14 storms reached typhoon intensity. Four of these reached "super typhoon" strength.
Typhoon Alice began as a tropical disturbance on January 1. Alice then on the 9th started to turn northward and began to weaken. Alice then dissipated rapidly on January 14.
Typhoon Hope was a powerful typhoon that hit Hong Kong On August 2 killing 112. 
Typhoon Sarah was a strong tropical cyclone that formed in the monsoon trough on October 4. Sarah then struck Vietnam causing many deaths and damage to crops.
Typhoon Tip was the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded.
Western North Pacific tropical cyclones were named by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The first storm of 1979 was named Alice and the final one was named Ben. The name Alice was retired after this season and replaced by Andy.

Freighter

A cargo ship or freighter is any kind of ship that carries cargo, goods, and materials from one port to another. Thousands of cargo carriers travel on the world's seas and oceans each year, and handle most international trade. Cargo ships are usually specially designed for a special task, often carrying tools like cranes to load and unload. They come in all sizes.

Common scold

In the criminal common law of England and Wales, a common scold was a type of public nuisance. The term was applied to a woman who caused trouble and who disturbed the peace by arguing and fighting with her neighbours all the time. The Latin language name for this type of woman was "communis rixatrix". This name's grammar only applies to females. This makes it clear that only women could commit this type of crime. 
When British people first went to the North America, they took this crime with them. 
The crime was often punished by "ducking". Ducking meant that the offender was placed in a chair over a river or pond. They were then lowered into the water, until they were all in the water. This was done several times. Few people were actually convicted of being a common scold, but it remained a crime listed on the law books of England and Wales until 1967. Because it applied only to women, it was eventually banned in the United States. This was because the U.S. Constitution (the highest law in the U.S.) does not allow people to be treated differently from each other. This comes from a section of the Constitution called the Equal Protection Clause.
In the "Commentaries on the Laws of England", William Blackstone says of this crime:
Lastly, a common scold, "communis rixatrix", (for our law-latin confines it to the feminine gender) is a public nuisance to her neighbourhood. For which offence she may be indicted; and, if convicted, shall be sentenced to be placed in a certain engine of correction called the trebucket, castigatory, or cucking stool, which in the Saxon language signifies the scolding stool; though now it is frequently corrupted into ducking stool, because the residue of the judgement is, that, when she is so placed therein, she shall be plunged in the water for her punishment.——Commentaries on the Laws of England, IV:13.5.8, p. *169 
The common punishment for being a common scold was forcing the woman found guilty under water over and over. This was done using a piece of furniture called a "cucking stool". The cucking stool, according to Blackstone, later was called a "ducking stool".
Other writers disagree with Blackstone. They say that the cucking stool and the ducking stool are really two different types of punishment devices. The "Domesday Book" mentions the use of a cucking stool in the town of Chester. The stool was also known as "cathedra stercoris". This Latin word translates to "dung chair". It is thought that the punishment involved letting everyone see the punished woman's buttocks. This type of chair was used to punish not only common scolds, but also people who make beer (brewers) and bakers who sold bad beer or bread. Francois Maximilian Misson, a French traveler and writer, wrote down the way the ducking chair was used in England in the early 1700s:
"The way of punishing scolding women is pleasant enough. They fasten an armchair to the end of two beams twelve or fifteen feet long, and parallel to each other, so that these two pieces of wood with their two ends embrace the chair, which hangs between them by a sort of axle, by which means it plays freely, and always remains in the natural horizontal position in which a chair should be, that a person may sit conveniently in it, whether you raise it or let it down. They set up a post on the bank of a pond or river, and over this post they lay, almost in equilibrio, the two pieces of wood, at one end of which the chair hangs just over the water. They place the woman in this chair and so plunge her into the water as often as the sentence directs, in order to cool her immoderate heat."——Francois Maximilian Misson
The ducking stool was not always tied down to one spot next to a river or pond. Sometimes it had wheels on it. The woman found guilty would be taken through the streets before punishment was done. Another way of ducking was to use a device called a "tumbrel". The tubmrel was a chair on two wheels. It had two long shafts on its axles. The tumbrel would be pushed into the ducking pond and the shafts would be released. This would tip the chair up backwards, ducking the victim.
A scold's bridle was another punishment device. It was known in Scotland as a brank. A scold's bridle was a metal mask that locked around a person's head. For that reason it was sometimes called a "head cage". The scold's bridle had a tab that went into the victims mouth to make it difficult to talk. Some people say that common scolds had to wear a scold's bridle to stop them from scolding. Some say they were used only to punish. No legal source known mentions the use of scold's bridals to punish a common scold. However, some less formal sources do tell of scolds being punished with scold's bridles. In the United States, scolds, or people found guilty of similar crimes, were sometimes punished using a cleft stick. A cleft stick was similar to a scold's bride, but they were easier to make. The ducking stool was taken to the U.S. when British people went to live there during colonial times.
A piece of writing mounted on the Fye Bridge in Norwich, England says it marks the place where a "cucking" stool had been in place from 1562–1597. It also says that "strumpets" (prostitutes) and common scolds were ducked there. In the "Percy Anecdotes", published in 1820, the authors state that "How long the ducking-stool has been in disuse in England does not appear." The "Anecdotes" also suggest that the ducking stool stopped being used because it did not work well. The text talks about a Mrs. Finch. It says of her that in about 1681, she had been found guilty of being a common scold for a third time. Each time she was found guilty she was ducked. When she was found guilty "a fourth time", the King's Bench (a court) did not order her punished by ducking. Instead, they ordered her to pay a money fine and that she be imprisoned until she paid the fine. 
The Percy miscellany also quotes a poem by John Gay (1685–1732), who wrote that:
and also a 1780 poem by Benjamin West, who wrote that:
These poems do not prove that the punishment took place at the time they were written. However, they do show that ducking had not been forgotten. 
In a 1704 legal case called "The Queen v. Foxby", 6 Mod. 11, the lawyer for the person accused of being a scold said that he did not know of any law allowing the ducking of scolds. Lord Chief Justice John Holt (the person trying to have the judge find Foxby guilty) said this was not correct. He said that it was "better ducking in aTrinity, than a Michaelmas term", meaning it was better that a person be ducked in summer than in winter. The way he said it, however, suggests that he thought the punishment was an old custom and something of a joke. The last written record of stools being used for ducking involved a Mrs. Ganble at Plymouth in 1808, and one Jenny Pipes from Leominster (a town in Herefordshire) in 1809. In 1817, Sarah Leeke, also from Leominster, was sentenced to be ducked. However, the water in the pond was too low. The authorities instead wheeled her around the town in the ducking chair. 
The common law of England—law made by court precedent, rather than through legislation—was adopted by the United States in its early days. The common law included the offence of being a common scold. In 1829, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania court found American writer and journalist Anne Royall guilty of being a common scold. Royall had objected to a firehouse, built with federal money, being used by a small church for their services. She thought this violated the U.S. Constitution's separation between church and state. The local clergymen campaigned to have her punished as a common scold. Hoping the court would sentence Royall to ducking, sailors at the Navy Yard built a ducking stool. However, the Pennsylvania court ruled that the punishment was not to be used any longer. They instead fined Royall ten dollars. In 1972, in the case of State v. Palendrano, 293 A.2d 747, New Jersey State prosecutors charged a woman with being a common scold for a disturbance she had caused. The New Jersey Superior Court ruled that the law was improper because of it was too vague.
In England and Wales, the only parts of the United Kingdom where the law was in use, no prosecutions of common scolds have occurred for a long time. The lawyers in Sykes v. Director of Public Prosecutions [1962] AC 528, described the offence as "obsolete". Section 13(1)(a) of the Criminal Law Act 1967 did away with it. 
The offence of being a common scold has also become obsolete in the United States because only women could commit it. This was found to violate the U.S. Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. Many states have laws restricting public profanity, loud noise in public, and disorderly conduct. None of these laws have any punishment similar to those traditionally used for the common scold.

Tropical Storm Peter (2003)

Tropical Storm Peter was a short-lived tropical storm that formed after the end of the Atlantic hurricane season. It formed from an extratropical storm, and at first, it was a subtropical cyclone. However, as it moved over warmer waters, it began to gain strength. On December 9, 2003, it became a tropical cyclone. An eye formed within the cyclone, and Peter almost became a hurricane. It reached its peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h), but wind shear and cooler waters quickly caused Peter to lose strength. 
An extratropical cyclone developed on December 2 in the eastern Atlantic Ocean about 1430 miles (2300 km) southwest of the Azores islands. It moved northwestward, then turned to the north, and developed gale force winds on December 4 after turning to the northeast. Later that day, it turned into a frontal low pressure system. As high pressure existed across the northeast Atlantic Ocean, the storm turned to the southeast. The system turned to the south-southwest on December 7. Later that day, thunderstorms formed around the center, and it is said that the system organized into a subtropical storm late on December 7 while located 835 miles (1340 km) south-southwest of the Azores. The storm moved to the southwest over warmer waters, and the thunderstorms, or convection, around the storm continued to get stronger. The convection became near the center as rainbands developed around the center. Since the storm was gaining more strength, the National Hurricane Center declared the system Tropical Storm Peter on December 9 while located 980 miles (1580 km) northwest of Praia in the Cape Verde islands.
Several days before Peter formed, forecasts anticipated the development of the storm. As it became a tropical storm, Peter was moving slowly, so initial forecasts said the storm would quickly die out. However, an eye feature quickly developed, and Peter strengthened to reach winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) late on December 9. Although the presence of an eye, along with Dvorak classifications of 75 mph (120 km/h), would usually mean the storm is of hurricane strength, Peter stayed as a strong tropical storm and quickly began to weaken. It moved northward due to a cold front. The combination of wind shear and cooler water temperatures quickly weakened the storm. By December 10, Peter became a tropical depression. As the system turned to the northeast, Peter turned into an extratropical storm on December 11. Shortly afterward, it was absorbed by the cold front.
Peter stayed over the open Atlantic Ocean for its entire lifetime. It did not affect land. Because of this, there were no deaths or damages. The storm formed in the month of December, which is rare, since most storms in the Atlantic exist between June and November. Another storm, Odette, also formed in December. This made the 2003 season the first year since 1887 that two storms developed in the month of December. Peter made 2003 the sixth most active Atlantic hurricane season (at the time, it was the fifth). The 235 days between the development of the first storm, Tropical Storm Ana, and the of the last storm, Peter, made the 2003 season the longest since 1952. Peter is one of only four Atlantic tropical cyclones to reach the "P" name since the official naming of hurricanes began in 1950.

Texas Revolution

In the 1820s, Americans began to migrate to Texas, which was part of Mexico at the time. At first the government thought this was good, but soon many more Americans than Mexicans lived in Texas. The leaders of Mexico began to worry that they might lose Texas to the Americans and so they decided to stop all immigration from the United States. 
To make things worse, Mexico had a new president, Antonio López de Santa Anna, who threw out the Mexican constitution and made himself president for life. He sent soldiers to Texas to make sure that the Texans wouldn't try to secede (separate) from Mexico. Americans and Mexicans living in Texas joined together to fight the Mexican army. The war lasted from October 2, 1835 to April 21, 1836. A famous battle in this war was the Battle of the Alamo in which about 200 Texans were killed. After the war, Texas was declared an independent country, and called itself The Republic of Texas It remained an independent country for ten years. In 1845 Congress voted to admit Texas as a slave state, making Texas the country's 28th state.

Max Euwe (20 May 1901 – 26 November 1981) was the 5th World Chess Champion, from 1935 to 1937. He was a Dutch chess grandmaster, mathematician, and author. He was not a full-time professional player; he got his PhD in pure mathematics in 1926, and worked as a school and college teacher. He was made Professor of Mathematics in 1964. 
Against all expectations, Max won the world chess championship in a match with Alexander Alekhine in 1935. Alekhine won the title back in a rematch two years later. After World War II, Euwe was still the best player in western Europe, and played in two world championship candidates tournaments. Max played for the world championship in 1948, in the match-tournament which decided the successor to Alekhine. He finished below Botvinnik, Smyslov, Keres and Reshevsky. Again he tried, at the Candidates' tournament in 1953, but this was also unsuccessful, though he was still a strong player.
Max used his teaching skills in chess as well as mathematics. He wrote 20 chess books, most aimed at helping the club player improve. He invented a subscription correspondence course called "The Chess Archives", but known everywhere as Euwe's Archives. This gave teaching on chess openings, which were then an area of great weakness for club players. The Archives were published in Dutch, German and English, and helped to give professional help to amateur players.
Euwe served as President of FIDE, the World Chess Federation, from 1970 to 1978. He tried to expand chess into more countries, a goal which has succeeded.

Pit bull

Pit bull is a word used to describe several breeds of dog. This includes the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully and Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and dogs with a mix of these breeds. In some locations, the modern American Bulldog and Bull Terrier are described as a "pit bull-type dog". Pit bull can also mean dogs that were known as "bull terriers" before the development of the modern Bull Terrier in the early 20th century.
These dogs were bred by crossing bulldog breeds and terriers. Pit bulls are very strong and can pull many times their weight. They were also bred for dog fighting. The place where such dogs fought was called a "pit". As such dogs can be dangerous, very often a special permit is needed to breed or to own them. Some places or countries may have forbiddden their use.
Pit bulls are sometimes called "pibbles". Some people think they are all aggressive, but they can be sweet when trained right. They use to have the nickname "nanny dog".

IAHD

The International Association of Handicapped Divers, the IAHD, is an association whose aim is to promote, develop and conduct programs for the training of people with a disability in scuba diving. Since it's began in 1993 the IAHD has held many professional and nonprofessional programs at locations all around the world.
The IAHD is a non profit foundation and all the people on the board are volunteers. There are also volunteers in regions around the world. Physical exercise helps people improve their health both physically and mentally. A person with a disability gets these benefits as well as increased social activity by taking up an activity like scuba diving. The risks in training a disabled person in diving are no higher than for able bodied people.
Instructors may have to alter some of the techniques and some equipment may also need changing to meet the individual's need. In some cases extra pool and / or open water training may be needed. In some extreme cases even individual lessons may be needed. IAHD believes that people with a disability should be in a regular class at some point in their training. Being involved with activities like scuba diving may even result in giving a person with a disability a renewed interest in life and provide positive and lasting benefits.

Ricardo Achiles Rangel (15 February 1924 - 11 June 2009) was a Mozambican photojournalist and photographer.
Rangel was born in the city of Lourenco Marques, now known as Maputo, Portuguese East Africa in February 1924. His father was a Greek businessman and Rangel was of African, European and Chinese descent. Rangel was raised by his African grandmother in the impoverished suburbs surrounding Lourenco Marques, while he visited his parents in the outlying provinces.
Rangel's photography career began during as the early 1940s by developing pictures in a private studio. Interest in taking photographs soon followed. Rangel was hired as the first non-white employee to join the Mozambican newspaper "Noticias de Tarde" in 1952, where he worked as a photographer. Rangel moved to "Noticias de Tarde" sister publication, "Notícias", in 1956.
He next became the head photographer at the Lourenco Marques daily newspaper, "A Tribuna", from 1960 until 1964. Rangel moved to the city of Beira during the mid-1960s. He worked as a photographer for several Beira-based newspapers including "Diário de Moçambique", "Voz Africana" and "Notícias da Beira". He returned to the city of Lourenco Marques during the late 1960s and returned to "Notícias". 
Rangel joined with four other Mozambican journalists in 1970 to found a weekly magazine called "Tempo", which in effect acted as the only publication in opposition to Portuguese rule. Additionally, "Tempo" was also Mozambique's first full color magazine. Rangel's worked as "Tempo"'s main photojournalist, often documenting poverty or Portuguese policies which were perceived as unfair by the publication.
Many of Rangel's colonial era photographs were banned or destroyed by Portuguese government censors, and could not be published or exhibited until Mozambique's independence in 1975. He became a frequent target of the Portuguese secret police, the PIDE.
Mozambique gained independence from Portugal in 1975. Rangel took an active role in training new Mozambican photographers throughout the post-independence era and Mozambican Civil War. He was appointed the chief photographer of Noticias in 1977, after most other photojournalists had left the country following Mozambique's independence.
Rangel became the first director of the weekly Mozambican publication "Domingo" in 1981. He went on to found the Photographic Training Centre, school for photography, in Maputo in 1983 and remained the centre's director until his death in 2009. Rangel began showing his work in European and African art galleries and museums beginning in 1983. 
Rangel also founded the Mozambican Photography Association, serving as the organization's first chairman. He was later bestowed the title of Life President by members of the association and remained the aaosciation's 
In 2008, Rangel was awarded an honorary doctorate in social science for his "contribution to Mozambican culture" from Eduardo Mondlane University, which is Mozambique's oldest and largest university.
Additionally, Rangel was elected to the Maputo Municipal Assembly from 1998 to 2003 as a member of the Juntos Pela Cidade (Together for the City). 
Rangel died in his sleep at his home in Maputo, Mozambique, on June 11, 2009, at the age of 85. He was survived by his Swiss wife, Beatrice. Rangel's funeral, which was held at Maputo City Hall on June 15, 2009, was attended by several dignitaries, including Prime Minister Luisa Diogo. Jazz music was played at the funeral according to his wishes, as Rangel was a fan of jazz. He was buried in the Lhanguene cemetery in Maputo.
Prime Minister Luisa Diogo praised Rangel's life and career at his funeral, noting that Rangel left "an indelible mark on the history of Mozambique." She also praised Rangel's colony era work which was used "to denounce colonial dictatorship," and pointed out that many of Rangel's photographs had been banned until Mozambique's independence.
Joao Costa, the head of the Mozambican Photographic Association (AMF), spoke of Rangel saying, "the man has died, but his work remains".
The movie “Ricardo Rangel – Hot Iron”, the director Licinio de Azevedo is a film designed the Instituto Camões in Luanda as part of the cycle CPLP Film Festival which takes place in the Angolan capital of the 10th day September 16, 2009.

Harem (genre)

Harem is a kind of story in Japanese anime and manga where a male character is surrounded by many female characters. "Suzuka", "Love Hina", "Ai Yori Aoshi", "Rosario + Vampire" and "Sekirei" are just a few examples. Most of the time the females are romantically interested in the main character. The term "harem" is generally not used by itself, but as an adjective to the genre—such as "harem anime" or "harem manga". The term orginates from the arabic word "hareem" which literally means women and was also used to refer to one man many women like a sultan hareem. 
Daryl Surat, a contributor to Otaku USA, suggests that many harem anime are built around one core fetish (e.g. meido ("Hanaukyo Maid Team"), meganekko ("G-On Riders"), lolicon ("Rozen Maiden"), nuns ("Amaenaideyo"), large breasts ("Eiken")). There are also reverse harem anime in which a female protagonist is surrounded by gorgeous boys: "Ouran Host Club" and "The Wallflower" being the best known.
Some recent harem titles have experienced a backlash from some anime fans in the United States, particularly from females, due to recurring usage of female fan service in series with the genre designation, prompting calls of sexism from some viewers. However, this is in spite of portrayals of male sexuality in anime being a fast-growing trend in the U.S.

The species live in the rainforests of New Guinea, and the border of central Irian Jaya in Indonesia. In the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, Goodfellow's tree-kangaroos are listed as endangered. This is a result of too much hunting of them, and humans living too close to their habitat. 
Like most tree-kangaroos, Goodfellow's tree-kangaroos are very different looking from terrestrial (land) Kangaroo species. Unlike land living kangaroos, their legs are not very large compared to their forelimbs (arms), which are strong and end in hooked claws for grasping tree branches. Goodfellow's tree-kangaroos have long tails for balance. These physical traits help them with a mostly tree-living life. They have short, woolly fur, usually reddish-brown in color, a gray-brown face, yellow-colored cheeks and feet; pale stomachs, long, golden-brown tails, and two golden stripes on their backsides. They weigh about 7 kilograms (about 15 pounds).
Goodfellow's tree-kangaroos are slow and on the ground. They move at about the speed a human walks and do not hop well (hopping is something that, by contrast, terrestrial kangaroos are famed for). However, in trees, Goodfellow's tree-kangaroos are fearless and agile. They climb by wrapping their arms around the trunk of a tree and hopping with their strong back legs. This allows their arms to slide. They have very good jumping ability and can jump from trees to the ground from thirty feet up without hurting themselves.
Goodfellow's tree-kangaroos feed mostly on the leaves of the silkwood tree ("Flindersia pimenteliana"). Other foods are part of their diet when available, including different kinds of fruit, cereals, flowers and grasses. They have large stomachs that they use similar to fermentation vats, much the way the stomachs of cows and related herbivores digest food. First the food is softened in one part of their stomach, and then by passing the material back up and chewing it again, they can return it to a second part of their stomach. This is where bacteria in the stomach's various chambers, breaks down the tough fibers of leaves and grasses.

Bowie knife

A Bowie knife is a large hunting knife. It is named after Colonel Jim Bowie. The knife was probably designed by his brother, Rezin P. Bowie. Rezin (pronounced "reason") gave his younger brother (Jim) the knife so he would always have a backup weapon. It became history after the "sandbar fight" on the banks of the Mississippi River in September 1827. This started as a duel but quickly became a fight between the two seconds, Judge Crane and Jim Bowie. Crane pulled out a pistol and shot at Bowie twice. One bullet hit Bowie in the leg the other killed an onlooker. Friends on both sides began shooting and slashing with knives. Bowie was wounded several times but managed to kill one assailant and wound another with what witnesses called a "big butcher knife". This made both Bowie, the knife-fighter, and his knife famous. More than a dozen knifemakers of the time claim to have made the first Bowie knife. But no one knows who made the first one or exactly what it looked like.

Danaus eresimus

The Soldier or Tropical Queen ("Danaus eresimus") is a North American and South American butterfly. It is in the family Nymphalidae. Their flight is slow and they are easy to approach. They will fly for some distance if approached too closely.
The upper side of the wings is a dark reddish-brown color. The fore wing (the top wing) sometimes has white spots along the edge. The veins are lightly marked with black. The male has a black patch on his hind wing (the bottom wing). This spot releases scents to help the female find and mate with the male. This spot is called an androconium (plural, androconia). The underside of the wings is also a dark brown color. There is a band made up of square shaped spots in the center of the hind wing. The Soldier has a wingspan of 2½ to 3½ inches.
Similar species in the Soldier's range include the Monarch ("Danaus plexippus") and the Queen ("Danaus gilippus").
The Monarch is more orange. It has heavier black-lined veins. The underside of the wings is a pale yellowish color.
The Queen has nearly no black-lined veins. On the fore wing it has white spots on both surfaces of the wings.
The Soldier may be found in a variety of open, subtropical habitats such as citrus groves, weedy water edges, and dry fields.
This butterfly my be seen from February to December in southern Florida (it is most common in October to December). In southern Texas, it is seen from August to January.
The eggs are bright orange. The black caterpillar is banded with white and yellow stripes. It has a row of yellowish-tan spots near the top of the body. There are six black, fleshy filaments. The first pair is near the head. The second pair is on the thorax. The third pair is at the end of the abdomen. The chrysalis is very similar to the Monarch's chrysalis. It is very hard to tell the difference between them. It has 3 or more broods per year.
Here is a list of host plants that the Soldier caterpillar feeds on:
