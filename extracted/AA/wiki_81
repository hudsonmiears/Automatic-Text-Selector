Machinima

Machinima ( or ) is a type of animation and digital moviemaking style. It is the use of 3D computer graphics with a 3D video game or computer game to create the 3D animation. The creator who is making the video will record in-game animation and edit it with voice recordings. Machinima can be script-driven, meaning the cameras, characters, and effects are scripted for playback in real time. Unlike other types of animation, the scripting is driven by events and not keyframes.
"Machinima" limits the controls of other animation types. This is according to Machinima.org. For example, "Machinima" videos can be shot live or scripted in real time. So it becomes much faster to produce than traditionally animated movies.
"Machinima" productions can remain close to their gaming roots and feature stunts or other portrayals of gameplay. Popular genres include dance videos, comedy, and drama. Alternatively, some filmmakers attempt to stretch the boundaries of the rendering engines or to mask the original 3-D context. The Academy of Machinima Arts & Sciences (AMAS), a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting machinima, recognizes exemplary productions through Mackie awards given at its annual Machinima Film Festival. Some general film festivals accept machinima, and game companies, such as Epic Games, Blizzard Entertainment and Jagex, have sponsored contests involving it.\
The AMAS defines machinima as "animated filmmaking within a real-time virtual 3-D environment". In other 3-D animation methods, creators can control every frame and nuance of their characters but, in turn, must consider issues such as key frames and in-betweening. Machinima creators leave many rendering details to their host environments, but may thus inherit those environments' limitations. Because game animations focus on dramatic rather than casual actions, the range of character emotions is often limited. However, Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd state that a small range of emotions is often sufficient, as in successful Japanese anime television series.
Another difference is that machinima is created in real time, but other animation is pre-rendered. Real-time engines need to trade quality for speed and use simpler algorithms and models. In the 2001 animated film "", every strand of hair on a character's head was independent; real-time needs would likely force them to be treated as a single unit. Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd argue that improvement in consumer-grade graphics technology will allow more realism; For cut scenes in video games, issues other than visual fidelity arise. Pre-rendered scenes can require more digital storage space, weaken suspension of disbelief through contrast with real-time animation of normal gameplay, and limit interaction.
Like live action, machinima is recorded in real-time, and real people can act and control the camera. Filmmakers are often encouraged to follow traditional cinematic conventions, such as avoiding wide fields of view, the overuse of slow motion, and errors in visual continuity. Unlike live action, machinima involves less expensive, digital special effects and sets, possibly with a science-fiction or historical theme. Explosions and stunts can be tried and repeated without monetary cost and risk of injury, and the host environment may allow unrealistic physical constraints. University of Cambridge experiments in 2002 and 2003 attempted to use machinima to re-create a scene from the 1942 live-action film "Casablanca". Machinima filming differed from traditional cinematography in that character expression was limited, but camera movements were more flexible and improvised. Nitsche compared this experiment to an unpredictable Dogme 95 production.
Berkeley sees machinima as "a strangely hybrid form, looking forwards and backwards, cutting edge and conservative at the same time". Machinima is a digital medium based on 3-D computer games, but most works have a linear narrative structure. Some, such as "Red vs. Blue" and "The Strangerhood", follow narrative conventions of television situational comedy. Nitsche agrees that pre-recorded ("reel") machinima tends to be linear and offers limited interactive storytelling; he sees more opportunities in machinima performed live and with audience interaction. In creating their improvisational comedy series "On the Campaign Trail with Larry & Lenny Lumberjack" and talk show "Tra5hTa1k with ILL Will", the ILL Clan blended real and virtual performance by creating the works on-stage and interacting with a live audience. In another combination of real and virtual worlds, Chris Burke's talk show "This Spartan Life" takes place in "Halo 2"s open multiplayer environment. There, others playing in earnest may attack the host or his interviewee. Although other virtual theatrical performances have taken place in chat rooms and multi-user dungeons, machinima adds "cinematic camera work". Previously, such virtual cinematic performances with live audience interaction were confined to research labs which had powerful computers. 
Machinima can be less expensive than other forms of filmmaking. Strange Company produced its feature-length machinima film "BloodSpell" for less than Â£10,000. Before using machinima, Burnie Burns and Matt Hullum of Rooster Teeth Productions spent US$9,000 to produce a live-action independent film; in contrast, the four Xbox game consoles used to make "Red vs. Blue" in 2005 cost $600. The low cost caused a product manager for Electronic Arts to compare machinima to the low-budget independent film "The Blair Witch Project", without the need for cameras and actors. Because these are seen as low barriers to entry, machinima has been called a "democratization of filmmaking". Berkeley weighs increased participation and a blurred line between producer and consumer against concerns that game copyrights limit commercialization and growth of machinima.
Comparatively, machinimists using pre-made virtual platforms like Second Life have indicated that their productions can be made quite successfully with no cost at all. Creators like Dutch director Chantal Harvey, producer of the 48 Hour Film Project Machinima sector, have created upwards of 200 films using the platform. Harvey's advocacy of the genre has resulted in the involvement of film director Peter Greenaway who served as a juror for the Machinima category and gave a keynote speech during the event.
Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd list four main methods of creating machinima. From simple to advanced, these are: relying on the game's AI to control most actions, digital puppetry, recamming, and precise scripting of actions. Although simple to produce, AI-dependent results are unpredictable, thus complicating the realization of a preconceived film script. For example, when Rooster Teeth produced "The Strangerhood" using "The Sims 2", a game that encourages the use of its AI, the group had to create multiple instances of each character to accommodate different moods. Individual instances were selected at different times to produce appropriate actions.
In digital puppetry, machinima creators become virtual actors; each crew member controls a character in real-time, as in a multiplayer game. The director can use built-in camera controls, if available. Otherwise, video is captured from the perspectives of one or more puppeteers who serve as camera operators. Puppetry allows for improvisation and offers controls familiar to gamers, but requires more personnel than the other methods and is less precise than scripted recordings. However, some games, such as the "Halo" series, (except for Halo PC and Custom Edition, which allow AI and custom objects and characters), allow filming only through puppetry. According to Marino, other disadvantages are the possibility of disruption when filming in an open multi-user environment and the temptation for puppeteers to play the game in earnest, littering the set with blood and dead bodies. However, Chris Burke intentionally hosts "This Spartan Life" in these unpredictable conditions, which are fundamental to the show. Other works filmed using puppetry are the ILL Clan's improvisational comedy series "On the Campaign Trail with Larry & Lenny Lumberjack" and Rooster Teeth Productions' "Red vs. Blue". In recamming, which builds on puppetry, actions are first recorded to a game engine's demo file format, not directly as video frames. Without re-enacting scenes, artists can then manipulate the demo files to add cameras, tweak timing and lighting, and change the surroundings. This technique is limited to the few engines and software tools that support it.
A technique common in cut scenes of video games, scripting consists of giving precise directions to the game engine. A filmmaker can work alone this way, as J. Thaddeus "Mindcrime" Skubis did in creating the nearly four-hour "The Seal of Nehahra" (2000), the longest work of machinima at the time. However, perfecting scripts can be time-consuming. Unless what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editing is available, as in "", changes may need to be verified in additional runs, and non-linear editing may be difficult. In this respect, Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd compare scripting to stop-motion animation. Another disadvantage is that, depending on the game, scripting capabilities may be limited or unavailable. Matinee, a machinima software tool included with "Unreal Tournament 2004", popularized scripting in machinima.
When "Diary of a Camper" was created, no software tools existed to edit demo files into films. Rangers clan member Eric "ArchV" Fowler wrote his own programs to reposition the camera and to splice footage from the "Quake" demo file. "Quake" movie editing software later appeared, but the use of conventional non-linear video editing software is now common. For example, Phil South inserted single, completely white frames into his work "No Licence" to enhance the visual impact of explosions. In the post-production of "", Rooster Teeth Productions added letterboxing with Adobe Premiere Pro to hide the camera player's head-up display.
Machinima creators have used different methods to handle limited character expression. In the "Halo" video game series, helmets completely cover the characters' faces. To prevent confusion, Rooster Teeth's characters move slightly when speaking, a convention shared with anime. Some machinima creators use custom software. For example, Strange Company uses Take Over GL Face Skins to add more facial expressions to their characters filmed in BioWare's 2002 role-playing video game "Neverwinter Nights". Similarly, Atussa Simon used a "library of faces" for characters in "The Battle of Xerxes". In some cases, some game companies may provide such software; examples include Epic Games' Impersonator for "Unreal Tournament 2004" and Valve Corporation's FacePoser for "Half-Life 2". Another solution is to blend in non-machinima elements, as nGame did by inserting painted characters with more expressive faces into its 1999 film "Berlin Assassins". It may be possible to point the camera elsewhere or employ other creative cinematography or acting. For example, Tristan Pope combined creative character and camera positioning with video editing to suggest sexual actions in his controversial film "Not Just Another Love Story".

Clash of the Titans

Clash of the Titans is a 1981 movie. It is about the Greek hero Perseus. He is played by Harry Hamlin. The movie features the final work of stop motion artist, Ray Harryhausen. It made $41 million in the United States. It was the 11th highest money-making movie of the year. Warner Bros. released a remake in 3D on April 2, 2010. Many big stars were in the movie including Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, and Ursula Andress.
King Acrisius of Argos (Donald Houston) has his daughter DanaÃ« (Vida Taylor) imprisoned in a tower, out of jealousy for her beauty. However, Zeus (Laurence Olivier), king of the Greek gods, impregnates her and the product of this affair is Perseus. Fearing that his grandson will one day grow up to kill him, Acrisius has both mother and child set out to sea in a wooden chest, in the hopes of killing them. However, out of revenge, Zeus has Acrisius killed and orders the sea god Poseidon (Jack Gwillim) to release the last of the Titans, a giant humanoid sea monster called the Kraken, to destroy Argos. Meanwhile, DanaÃ« and Perseus miraculously survive and land on the island of Seriphos, where Perseus grows into a young man.
Calibos (Neil McCarthy) is a young man who is the son of the sea goddess Thetis (Maggie Smith) and due to be married to Andromeda (Judi Bowker), daughter of Queen Cassiopeia (SiÃ¢n Phillips) and heiress to the throne of Joppa; however, he has killed off every living thing in the Wells of the Moon (which he was entrusted to guard), among them Zeus' sacred herd of winged horses (except for Pegasus). To punish him, Zeus transforms Calibos into a monstrous satyr and has him exiled by his people. In retribution, Thetis transports the adult Perseus (Harry Hamlin) to an abandoned amphitheatre in Joppa where he encounters the aged poet Ammon (Burgess Meredith) from whom he learns that Andromeda is under a curse and is unable to marry unless her suitors can correctly answer a riddle; those who fail are burned at the stake. To aid his son, Zeus sends Perseus an invisibility helmet from Athena (Susan Fleetwood), a magic sword from Aphrodite (Ursula Andress) and a shield from Hera (Claire Bloom). Wearing the helmet, Perseus manages to capture Pegasus and follows Andromeda to learn the next riddle. Calibos nearly kills Perseus, but he escapes, losing his helmet in the process and also managing to sever Calibos' hand.
With the help of Thallo (Tim Pigott-Smith), Perseus presents himself as a suitor and correctly answers the riddle, presenting Calibos' severed hand and winning the hand of Andromeda in marriage. When Calibos finds his mother cannot act against Perseus, he commands her to take vengeance on Joppa. When Cassiopeia compares her daughter's beauty to that of Thetis', the enraged goddess demands that Andromeda must be sacrificed to the Kraken or Joppa will be destroyed. 
While Perseus tries to find a way to conquer the Kraken, Pegasus is captured by Calibos' henchmen. Zeus commands Athena to give her owl Bubo to Perseus, but she convinces the gods' blacksmith Hephaestus (Pat Roach) to create a golden replica instead, who leads Perseus to a trio of hags called the Stygian Witches (Flora Robson, Anna Manahan and Freda Jackson), who have one tooth and eye between them. By taking their magic eye, Perseus forces them to reveal that the only way for the Kraken to be killed is by killing the gorgon, Medusa, who lives on an island at the edge of the Underworld. The group continues on their journey, minus Andromeda and Ammon, who return to Joppa. 
While on the Gorgon's island, Perseus and his companions are attacked by Dioskilos, Medusa's two-headed hellhound. During the fight, one of the party is killed by the beast, before he is eventually slain by Perseus. He leads his two remaining allies into the gorgon's lair, where Medusa herself kills the two men, shooting one of them with an arrow and petrifying the other. Perseus uses his shield's reflective side to deceive Medusa and decapitates her. He collects her head, but his shield is dissolved by the gorgon's caustic blood. 
As Perseus and his party set to return they are attacked by Calibos, who punctures the bag containing Medusa's severed head, and three giant scorpions called Scorpiochs rise out of the blood. They attack Thallo, who managed to kill one of the scorpions, who Calibos later kills. Perseus slays the two remaining scorpions and Calibos, and later grieves for Thallo. Weakened from his fight, Perseus sends Bubo to rescue the captive Pegasus. Bubo succeeds in freeing the horse and he also manages to destroy Calibos' camp. Perseus manages to reach the Joppa amphitheater, but collapses from exhaustion. Andromeda is chained to the cliffs near Joppa and the Kraken is summoned. Bubo arrives and diverts the monster's attention until Perseus (whose strength was secretly restored by Zeus) arrives, mounted on Pegasus. In the battle, he uses Medusa's head to turn the Kraken to stone, causing to crumble into pieces. Perseus then throws Medusa's head into the ocean, frees Andromeda and subsequently marries her.
The gods predict that Perseus and Andromeda will live happily for the rest of the lives and have children. Zeus also forbids the gods from pursuing vengeance against them. The constellations of Perseus, Andromeda, Cassiopeia and Pegasus are created in their honor.

Hercules Against the Moon Men is a 1964 Italian/French movie. It was directed by Giacomo Gentilomo. It stars Alan Steel (real name Sergio Ciani). The movie "blends" elements from Roman, Greek, Cretan and Egyptian mythologies. In the original Italian language version, the hero was not Hercules. The hero was Maciste. Maciste was a hero in Italian silent movies. Its original Italian title was "Maciste e la regina di Samar" ("Maciste and the Queen of Samar"). Its French title was "Maciste contre les hommes de pierre" ("Maciste Against the Men of Stone"). The English distributors dubbed the hero Hercules, because Maciste was not well known to American audiences.
A race of evil moon men land on Earth. For years, they have terrorized the city of Samar. They have made the people of Samar give them children to be sacrifices. Now, the queen of Samar has made an pact with the moon men to take control of the world. She wants to become the most powerful woman alive. The people of Samar do not like all the chaos.

Women's movies is a movie genre. These movies are ones that moviemakers expect women to like. They are about women. They have themes that moviemakers think would interest women such as home, family life, being a mother, making sacrifices, and romance. Women's movies are movies that were made "for" women by predominantly male screenwriters and directors whereas "women's cinema" is movies that have been made "by" women. Women's movies have been made for years and years, ever since the silent movie days. It took a while for the term "woman's movie" to be used though. These movies were called "melodramas" at first. They were very popular during World War II. Their production fell off in the 1960s. The term "woman's movie" went south in the 1960s even though such movies were still being made. George Cukor, Douglas Sirk, Max OphÃ¼ls, and Josef von Sternberg directed woman's movies. Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, and Barbara Stanwyck made many woman's movies. "Mildred Pierce", "Jezebel" and "Stella Dallas" are examples of woman's movies.

In Search of the Castaways

In Search of the Castaways is a 1962 Walt Disney Productions movie. It stars Hayley Mills, George Sanders, and Maurice Chevalier. The movie was directed by Robert Stevenson. It was based on Jules Verne's 1868 adventure novel "Captain Grant's Children". The movie was Mills's third of six movies for the Disney Studios. The movie was a box office hit.
The Sherman brothers (Robert B. and Richard M. Sherman) wrote the songs "Castaway", "Merci Beaucoup", "Let's Climb", and "Enjoy It". Movie critic Hal Erickson wrote, "[The movie] is a roller-coaster of a Disney film, making up in excitement what it lacks in credibility or coherence...the film was ideal Saturday-matinee fodder for the kiddie trade in 1963."
Teenager Mary Grant, her brother Robert, and their friend Professor Paganel, persuade Lord Glenarvan to rescue shipwrecked Captain Grant. They sail halfway around the world on Lord Glenarvan's yacht. The friends survive an earthquake, a flood, a fire, an attack by a giant condor, and a volcanic eruption before rescuing Captain Grant from fierce Maoris.
A subplot involves a criminal named Thomas Ayerton, a former crew-member of Captain Grant's ship. He was responsible for Captain Grant's disappearance. Another subplot involves a romance between Mary and Lord Glenarvan's son John.

Lake retention time

Lake retention time (also called the residence time of lake water, or the water age or flushing time) is the calculated average time that water (or a dissolved substance) spends in a lake. At its simplest this figure is the result of dividing the lake volume by the flow in or out of the lake. It describes the amount of time that is needed for a substance to flow in and out of a lake.

Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s

Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s (8 December 1861 â 21 January 1938) was a French moviemaker. He led the way in the use of special effects, multiple exposures, time-lapse photography, dissolves, and hand-painted colour in his work. His movies include "Conquest of the Pole", "A Trip to the Moon", and "The Impossible Voyage". These movies involve strange, surreal voyages, like those in Jules Verne's books. These movies are among the most important early science fiction movies. MÃ©liÃ¨s's "The Haunted Castle" is an early horror movie.
MÃ©liÃ¨s was born in Paris, France in 1861. He liked drawing and playing with a puppet theater as a child. He went to the theater often as a young man. About 1888, MÃ©liÃ¨s bought the ThÃ©atre Robert-Houdin and worked there as a magician. He became obsessed with moviemaking after seeing a movie by Antoine LumiÃ¨re in 1895. In May 1896, he acquired his own movie camera and set up a movie studio. At the end of 1896, he formed a new company, Star Film.
MÃ©liÃ¨s began making movies that were three to nine minute long. He wrote, designed, filmed, and acted in nearly all of his movies. He liked putting magic tricks into his movies. While filming a street scene one day, the camera stopped briefly. When MÃ©liÃ¨s looked at the movie later, he noticed that at the moment of the break, the bus he had been filming suddenly disappeared and new vehicles replaced it. Making items appear and disappear by stopping and starting the camera would become one of his most commonly used movie tricks. 
In 1902, MÃ©liÃ¨s produced his first masterpiece, "A Trip to the Moon". It was inspired by several works of the time that speculated about life on the moon. H.G. Wells and Jules Verne wrote about space travel, for instance, and Offenbach composed an opera about a trip to the moon. "Trip" was a huge success in France. MÃ©liÃ¨s hoped to make a fortune showing it in the United States. Thomas Edison and other moviemakers made copies of "Trip" however, and made money on MÃ©liÃ¨s's work. There was nothing he could do about these thieves.

The Haunted Castle

The Haunted Castle is an 1896 three-minute-long French movie written, directed, and produced by Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s. The movie contains many traditional pantomime elements. It was meant to amuse people, not frighten them. It is considered to be the first horror and vampire movie. "The Haunted Castle" is now in the public domain. In English, this movie has been known as "The Haunted Castle", "The Devil's Castle", "The Devil's Manor", "The Manor of the Devil", and "The House of the Devil". It was released on Christmas Eve, 1896, at the Theatre Robert Houdin, 8 boulevard des Italiens, Paris.
A large bat flies into a castle. The bat circles slowly while flapping its monstrous wings. Suddenly, it changes into Mephistopheles (Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s). After preparing a cauldron, the demon produces skeletons, ghosts, and witches from the bubbling contents of a cauldron. One of those summoned from the underworld holds up a crucifix.

Triodia is a large genus of grass endemic to Australia. They are often called spinifex, but they are not a part of the genus "Spinifex", which is only found near the coast. There are 64 known species. Triodia is a perennial grass that grows in dry areas. They have spikey, pointed leaves, about 30-40 centimetres long.
The leaf tips can break off in people's skin, causing infections. Spinifex has been used by Australian Aborigines in many things. The seeds are collected for food. Spinifex resin is used as a glue in spear-making. The grasses were also burned to make smoke signals, to communicate with groups a long way away. Some species are used for building shelters. Others are used to make traps for catching fish.

The Camp David summit of the Group of Eight (G8) was the 38th meeting in a series which began in 1976. 
Previous G8 summits have been hosted by the United States at San Juan, Puerto Rico (1976); Williamsburg, Virginia (1983); Houston, Texas, Denver, Colorado (1997) and Sea Island, Georgia.
The G8 and the summit are part of a consultation process. The G8 is not an international organization. It is an informal group.
The participants were the "core members" of the group:
A number of national leaders are traditionally invited to attend the summit. They are asked to participate in some, but not all, G8 summit activities. The leaders of four African nations were invited by the US president:
The G8 leaders talked about making progress towards food security in Africa. 
Others were invited, including:
The summit is intended as a venue for resolving differences among the G8 members.
Traditionally, the host country of the G8 summit sets the agenda.
Discussions at the 38th G8 summit included some issues from previous summits.
The G8 discussions included a range of topics, including 
Planners anticipated protest groups and other activists. 
When the venue for the summit was changed from Chicago, a White House spokesman said security and the possibility of protests were not factors in the decision. Some protest groups took credit for the change of venue.
For some, the G8 summit was a profit-generating event; as for example, the "G8 Summit" magazines which have been published since 1998. 
Local businesses near Camp David are expecting more people in the area and profits because of the summit.

Western Christianity is a part of the Christian religion. Western Christianity talks about the religious traditions of Christians whose ancestors were from Western Europe.
Western Christianity includes people who are members of the Catholic Church, as well as people who are members of Protestant churches. The Protestant churches were formed by people who were former members of the Catholic Church. Many Protestant churches started during the Protestant Reformation in about 1600. 
As the Protestant leaders were former members of the Catholic Church, Protestants share many, but not all, religious beliefs and religious traditions with Catholics. However, Western Christianity is different from Eastern Christianity, which has a different set of religious traditions, but many of the same religious beliefs.
Western Christianity makes up about 90% of Christians worldwide. The Roman Catholic Church has over half of all Christians. The many Protestant and related denominations make up another 40%. Baptists, Lutherans, and Anglicans are some of the larger and older Western denominations which are not the Roman Catholic Church.

A biosphere reserve is an ecosystem with plants and animals of unusual scientific and naturalinterest. It is a label given by UNESCO to help protect the sites. The plan is to promote management, research and education in ecosystem conservation. This includes the 'sustainable use of natural resources'. If, for example, fish or trees are taken for human use, this is done in ways which least damage the ecosystem.
The program is run by UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme. It has started a World Network of Biosphere Reserves. The MAB programme built up the World Network of Biosphere Reserves since 1971. Biosphere reserves exchange knowledge and experiences on new ideas for sustainable development. They are areas used to develop new ways of doing things, test these ways and share the results.

Lake Amadeus

Lake Amadeus () is a huge salt lake in the southwest corner of the Northern Territory, in Australia. It is about north of Uluá¹u. The lake is 180Â km long and 10Â km wide. It is the largest salt lake in the Northern Territory. Because of the dryness of the area, the lake is usually a dry salt crust. When it rains enough, water flows through it towards the east. It eventually connects to the Finke River. Lake Amadeus holds up to 600Â million tonnes of salt. The groundwater soaks into the ground, and the lake supports several reliable springs.
The first European to find the lake was the explorer Ernest Giles in 1872. He had seen Kata Tjuta from far away and was making his way there. The lake blocked his path. He could not go over it because the dry lake bed was not able to hold the weight of his horses. He described the lake as "an infernal lake of mud and brine". Giles was going to name it "Lake Ferdinand" after Baron Ferdinand von Mueller. But Mueller asked Giles to instead name it after King Amadeus I of Spain. Amadeus had honoured Mueller a few years before.
Lake Amadeus is on Aboriginal land, and is covered by the Katiti and Petermann Aboriginal Land Trusts.

Elder Futhark

Elder Futhark is the oldest known runic script. It was used by Germanic tribes during the 2nd to 8th century. It consists of 24 different characters that are used like an alphabet; each character represents a sound or syllable. All Germamic tribes used the same form and same language. Its use lasted to the mid 8th century. Scholars are still discussing when it was first used: The oldest known use which is not disputed is a comb on the Vimose inscriptions from Denmark. It dates around the year 160. There are also runes on the Meldorf fibula, which date from the year 50. The inscription on the fibular is made of characters that are probably runes. The problem is that these characters can also represent symbols in the Latin alphabet.
Many of the characters from Elder Futhark resemble Latin or etruscan ones. For this reason, Elder Futhark had probably modelled form Southern Europe. The ordering of the Futhark letters is completely different from other known alphabets. In contrast, the ordering of the Latin alphabet is the same as the Greek one, which preceded it.

Max Schreck

Friedrich Gustav Max Schreck (6 September 1879 â 20 February 1936) was a German actor. He is remembered for his role in the horror movie "Nosferatu" (1922).
Schreck was born in Berlin-Friedenau, on 6 September 1879. He received his training at the " (the State Theatre of Berlin). He completed his studies in 1902. He made his stage debut in Meseritz and Speyer. He then toured Germany for two years appearing at theatres in Zittau, Erfurt, Bremen, Lucerne, Gera, and Frankfurt am Main. Schreck then joined Max Reinhardt's company of performers in Berlin. Many of Reinhardt's troupe made a significant contribution to movies.
Between 1919 and 1922, Schreck appeared at the Munich Kammerspiele. He had a role in the expressionist production of Bertolt Brecht's debut, " ("Drums in the Night"). He played the "freakshow landlord" Glubb. During this time he also worked on his first movie "Der Richter von Zalamea". In 1921, he was hired by Prana Film for their first and only movie, "Nosferatu". The company declared itself bankrupt after the movie was released. They did not want to pay copyright infringement costs to "Dracula" author Bram Stoker's widow. Schreck portrayed Count Orlok in the movie. The character was very similar to Count Dracula.
In 1923, Schreck was still in Munich. He appeared in a 16-minute (one-reeler) slapstick, "surreal comedy" written by Bertolt Brecht entitled ' ("Mysteries of a Barbershop"). Schreck appeared as a blind man in the film ' ("The Street") the same year.
Schreck's second collaboration with "Nosferatu" director F. W. Murnau was the 1924 comedy "" ("The Grand Duke's Finances"). Murnau did not like the final product.
In 1926, Schreck returned to the Kammerspiele in Munich. He continued to act in movies. He made the transition to "talkies". He died in 1936 in Munich of a heart attack. On 19 February 1936, Schreck had just played The Grand Inquisitor in the play "". That evening he felt unwell. The doctor sent him to the hospital where he died early the next morning His obituary praised his role as The Miser in MoliÃ¨re's comedy play. He was buried on 14 March 1936 at Wilmersdorfer Waldfriedhof in Berlin.
Schreck was married to actress Fanny Normann. She appeared in a few movies. She was often credited as Fanny Schreck. The word "schreck" is also the German word for "fright", or "terror". Because of this, many authors who were unaware of Schreck's on-stage credits (and ignorant of the rather sparse details of his personal life) speculated that there was really no such person, and that Schreck was, in fact, some well-known actor who had chosen to adopt a pseudonym for his role in "Nosferatu". One of the prime "suspects" was Alfred Abel; however, a careful examination of the photographs of these two actors is sufficient to dispel such notions.
Schreck's contemporaries recalled he was a loner with an unusual sense of humor. He was skilled in playing grotesque characters. One reported he lived in "a remote and strange world". He was said to spend time walking through dark forests.
The person and performance of Max Schreck in "Nosferatu" has been fictionalized by actor Willem Dafoe in E. Elias Merhige's "Shadow of the Vampire". In a sort of secret history, "Shadow" posits that Schreck actually "was" a vampire.
Scriptwriter Daniel Waters created the character Max Shreck for the film "Batman Returns" and compared him to the character Max Schreck played in "Nosferatu". "Variety" claimed the name was an in-joke. Shreck was a character created exclusively for the movie, absent from the comics, and serves as one of the main antagonists.

Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem

The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is one of the last remaining large, nearly intact ecosystems in the northern temperate zone of the Earth. It is partly in Yellowstone National Park. Its management has been controversial: the area is a flagship site for conservation groups that promote ecosystem management. The Greater Yellow Ecosystem (GYE) is a kind of natural laboratory in landscape ecology and geology. It is a world-renowned recreational site, and home to the animals of Yellowstone.
The Yellowstone National Park boundaries were drawn in 1872 to include all the geothermal basins in the area. By the 1970s, the grizzly bear's ("Ursus arctos") range in and near the park became the unofficial minimum boundary of a Greater Yellowstone ecosystem. This had at least . Since then, definitions of the greater ecosystem's size have steadily grown larger. A 1994 study listed the size as , while a 1994 speech by a Greater Yellowstone Coalition leader enlarged that to .
In 1985 the United States House of Representatives Subcommittees on Public Lands and National Parks and Recreation held a joint subcommittee hearing on Greater Yellowstone. The result was a 1986 report by the Congressional Research Service which said that different agencies were not working well together, and the area's essential values were at risk.
There are other areas within the Greater Yellowstone area which are managed by federal authorities. They include the Gallatin, Custer, Caribou-Targhee, Bridger-Teton and Shoshone National Forests, the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway, the National Elk Refuge and Grand Teton National Park. The GYE also includes some private lands around those managed by the U.S. Government. 
Outside of Yellowstone National Park, ten wilderness areas have been established in the National Forests since 1966 to get more habitat protection than usual.

It (1927 movie)

It is a 1927 silent movie. It is a romantic comedy movie. The story is about a girl who works in a department store. She sets her sights on her handsome and rich boss. The movie's star Clara Bow became known as the "It girl". Dorothy Parker quipped about Bow's character: "It, hell: She had those." The picture was believed lost, but a copy was found in Prague in the 1960s. In 2001, "It" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
Betty Lou Spence (Clara Bow) has a crush on her handsome boss, Cyrus Waltham, Jr. (Antonio Moreno). He is the new manager of his father's big department store. They belong to different social classes. He is already romantically involved with socialite Adela Van Norman (Jacqueline Gadsden). Cyrus's silly friend Monty (William Austin) notices Betty. She uses him to get closer to Cyrus. 
When she finally gets Cyrus's attention, she convinces him to take her on a date to Coney Island. He has a wonderful time. He tries to kiss her on the way home. Betty Lou slaps his face. She hurries out of his car and into her flat. She then peeks out her window at him as he drives away.
Betty bravely proclaims herself as an unmarried mother to protect her sickly roommate Molly (Priscilla Bonner) from having her baby taken away by a couple of meddling welfare workers. Monty arrives at just the wrong moment, forcing Betty to continue the charade with him. He tells Cyrus. Although he is in love with her, Cyrus offers her an "arrangement" that includes everything but marriage. Betty Lou, shocked and humiliated, refuses, quits her job, and resolves to forget Cyrus. When she learns from Monty about Cyrus's misunderstanding, she fumes, and vows to teach her former beau a lesson.
When Cyrus hosts a yachting excursion, Betty Lou makes Monty take her along, masquerading as "Miss Van Cortland". Cyrus at first wants to remove her from the ship, but he cannot long resist Betty Lou's "it" factor; he eventually corners her and proposes marriage, but she gets him back, by telling him that she'd "rather marry his office boy", which accomplishes her goal, but breaks her heart. 
He then learns the truth about the baby, and leaves Monty at the helm of the yacht to go find her. Monty crashes the yacht into a fishing boat, tossing both Betty Lou and Adela into the water. Betty Lou saves Adela, punching her in the face when she panics and threatens to drown them both. At the end of the movie, she and Cyrus reconcile on the anchor of the yacht, with the first two letters of the ship's name, "Itola", between them. Monty and Adela are upset at losing their friends however, it's implied they pursue a relationship with each other as the movie ends.
Elinor Glynn is thought to have invented the concept of "It". Actually, in 1904, R. Kipling, in the short story "Mrs. Bathurst" introduced "It".
In February 1927 "Cosmopolitan" published a two-part serial story in which Glyn defined "It".
Paramount Pictures paid Glyn $50,000 for the concept. They gave her a small part in the movie as herself. She was given a "story and adaptation" credit.
Hope Loring, Louis D. Lighton and George Marion Jr. (titles) wrote the screenplay. Carl Sandburg noted that Glyn's magazine story was "not at all like the film, not like it in any respect." 
This is one of the first examples of a "concept film". It is also one of the earliest examples of product placement. The concept of "It" is referred to throughout the movie. In one scene, Glyn appears as herself to define "It" for Mr. Waltham. "Cosmopolitan Magazine" is featured prominently in another scene. In this scene, the character Monty reads Glyn's story and introduces it to the audience.
Stage actress Dorothy Tree had her first movie role in a small, uncredited part. A young Gary Cooper was cast in a minor role as a newspaper reporter.
"It" was a hit with American audiences. It broke box office records. Critics praised the movie. They said Bow was "a joy to behold".

Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man

Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) is a database that keeps track of all known human genes.
It list those which cause genetic disorders, and those which simply cause traits. There are about 8,000 entries for genes, and 15,000 entries for phenotypes, which are (roughly) the feature(s) caused by a person's genes.
When possible it links diseases to specific genes. It provides a useful tool for further research. OMIM is one of the databases housed in the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). People search it using the NCBI search menus.
Mendelian Inheritance in Man was started as books in the early 1960s. The 12th edition is the most recent book. The online version, OMIM, has been available since 1987. NCBI move it to the World Wide Web in 1995. By 2004, OMIM contained more than 15,000 records.
Every disease and gene is given a six digit number. The first digit in each number tells how the gene or disease is inheritance (passed from one generation to the next).
If the initial digit is 1, the trait is autosomal dominant; if 2, autosomal recessive; if 3, X-linked. Each trait defined in this dictionary has a MIM number, the number from the 12th edition of MIM. The MIM number is printed in square brackets with or without an asterisk (asterisks indicate that the mode of inheritance is known; a number symbol (#) before an entry number means that the phenotype can be caused by mutation in any of two or more genes) as appropriate. For example, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease [MIM #312080] is an X-linked recessive disorder.
Range of MIM codes: method of inheritance 
These codes have been used in the medical literature to provide a unified index to genetic diseases.

Un ballo in maschera

Un ballo in maschera (A Masked Ball) is an Italian opera in three acts. The music was written by Giuseppe Verdi. The libretto was written by Antonio Somma. It is based on EugÃ¨ne Scribe's "Gustave III ou Le Bal MasquÃ©". 
The opera was first performed at the Teatro Appollo in Rome, on February 17, 1859. One of Verdi's richest middle-period works, it relates the events surrounding the assassination of King Gustav III of Sweden, but because of censorship, the story was transposed to 17th century Boston, with Gustav becoming an English governor, Richard of Warwick. Nowadays, most productions present the opera in its original Swedish setting.

<doc id="332512" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=332512" title="Aboriginal land rights in Australia">
Aboriginal land rights in Australia

Aboriginal land rights in Australia are the special set of rights given to Indigenous Australians to own land. There are many different types of land rights laws. They all allow the government to grant land to indigenous (native) Australians under many different conditions (terms). Land rights schemes are in place in the Northern Territory, Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria. Under these laws, the title to the land is normally given to a community or ethnic group, not an individual. Usually, land that has been granted in a land rights claim can not be sold, traded, or mortgaged. Grants will be normally require that the land be passed down to future generations through inheritance.
The passing of Aboriginal land rights laws in Australia was caused by many important Aboriginal protests. It was not until the 1970s, though, that there came an "organised" movement for the recognition of Aboriginal land rights.
On 1 May 1946, more than 800 Aboriginal stockmen in the Pilbara region of Western Australia went on strike. They demanded wages for their work. They were joined by other Aboriginal workers from the towns of Port Hedland and Marble Bar. The strike ended in 1949.
In 1963, the government turned part of the Yolngu people's traditional lands (in Arnhem Land) into a bauxite mine. The Yolngu started a petition (now called the Yirrkala bark petitions) to demand the rights to these lands. The petition was turned into a legal case. Mining went ahead anyway, and the legal case went on for 41 years. The Yolngu were finally made a part of the agreement between the government and the mining company in 2011.
In 1964 and 1965, students from the University of Sydney formed a group called the Student Action for Aboriginals. They travelled into New South Wales country towns to research segregation between native and non-native people. They led protests to get people to know about the issue of Aboriginal civil rights. It became known as the Freedom Ride movement. At the time, Aboriginal people were not counted in the census and their civil rights were different to white citizens. This changed in 1967, when a referendum gave Aborigines the same rights as white Australians.
The Wave Hill walkoff was in August 1966. A total of 200 Gurindji stockmen and servants at Wave Hill cattle station went on strike to demand wages and the return of some of their traditional lands. The strike went for nine years. The demand was not met, but the Gurindji stayed camped on their traditional country. They chose to break the state's law but obey their own. It raised popular support for Aboriginal land rights. Supporters in the cities rallied for the Gurindji and eventually they won title to part of their land.
In 1973, an Aboriginal Land Rights Commission was created in the Northern Territory. This royal commission said that the government should recognise Aboringal Land Rights, and gave advice for passing laws on it. Prime Minister Gough Whitlam took the advice and brought a Land Rights Bill to parliament. It was changed by the next prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, and passed by the Governor-General on 16 December 1976.
In 1976, the Territory government passed the first Aboriginal land rights law in the country. It allowed Aboriginal people in the Territory to claim rights to land that their ancestors had lived on before the arrival of white people. Groups that made claims had to show proof of their traditional (historical) association with the land. This ended up giving almost 50% of land in the Northern Territory (around ) to native groups. Before this act, there had been many "indigenous reserves" in the Northern Territory. This land was owned by the government and set aside for Aboriginal people to live on until they were assimilated into white society. When the act was put into effect, the old "reserves" were given to the Aboriginal groups living on them without them having to make a claim.

Mario Manningham

Mario Cashmere Manningham (born May 25, 1986) is an American football wide receiver who currently plays for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League. He was drafted by the New York Giants in the third round of the 2008 NFL Draft. He played college football at Michigan.
In 2005, as a freshman, Manningham had 27 receptions for 433 yards and six touchdowns, including the game-winning catch as time expired in the game against Penn State, handing the Lions their only loss that season.
Manningham finished 2006 with a total 38 receptions 703 yards and nine touchdowns. He was named Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week two weeks in a row, first against Notre Dame and then against Wisconsin.
Manningham had a total of 72 receptions for 1,174 yards and 12 touchdowns in 2007.
After the 2007 season, Manningham opted to forgo (forget, not do) his eligibility for his senior year in 2008 and entered the NFL Draft. He finished his career at Michigan with 137 receptions for 2,310 yards and 27 touchdowns. Those marks (in order) placed him ninth, fifth, and fourth in school history.
Manningham was selected in the third round (95th overall) of the 2008 NFL Draft by the New York Giants.
During rookie training camp, Manningham said that he looked forward to playing with fellow former Michigan Wolverine Amani Toomer, who was with New York at the time. Manningham signed a four-year deal worth up to $2.3 million as a rookie.
Manningham has been working on his punt return abilities and competed for the punt returner spot in 2009.
Manningham kicked off the 2009 NFL season by catching three passes for 58 yards and a touchdown en route to the Giants' 23-17 win over the Washington Redskins. He followed this up by catching 10 passes for 150 yards and a juggling sliding catch for a touchdown in the Giants' 33-31 win over the Dallas Cowboys.
Manningham became the starting wide receiver opposite Steve Smith after fellow receiver Domenik Hixon was injured in a Week 2 game against the Dallas Cowboys.
Manningham let Victor Cruz and Hakeem Nicks take much of his playing time, and Manningham was only the #3 wideout in 2011.
On February 5, 2012, Manningham made a catch in the fourth quarter of Superbowl XLVI to set up the win against the Patriots. Trailing by 2 points with 3 minutes 46 seconds remaining, the Giants started the winning drive. Eli Manning lofted a long pass down the left sideline to Mario Manningham, who kept his feet inbounds by inches with two defenders around him. The Giants went on to beat the New England Patriots 21-17. Manningham ended the game with 5 catches for 73 yards. Most people think that he will not return to the Giants.
Manningham had reportedly been removed from "multiple teams'" draft boards due to alleged marijuana use in college. Mario denied testing positive at first, then sent a letter to all 32 teams saying he lied. Manningham claimed he failed two drug tests. Bob McGinn of the "Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel" reported that Manningham scored a 6 out of 50 on the Wonderlic exam. This along with several other problems caused his draft value to drop.

Broken Blossoms

Broken Blossoms, or The Yellow Man and the Girl is a silent movie directed by D. W. Griffith. It was distributed by United Artists. It premiered on May 13, 1919. 
It tells the story of a young girl who is abused by her alcoholic father. She meets a kind-hearted Chinese man who falls in love with her. The movie is based on Thomas Burke's short story "The Chink and the Child". 
In 1996, "Broken Blossoms" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
Cheng Huan (Richard Barthelmess) leaves his native China. He "dreams to spread the gentle message of Buddha to the Anglo-Saxon lands." His idealism fades in Londonâs brutal and gritty inner-city. He meets and grows devoted to the "broken blossom" Lucy Burrows (Lillian Gish). She is the beautiful but unwanted and abused daughter of prizefighter Battling Burrows (Donald Crisp).
After being beaten and discarded one evening by her raging father, Lucy finds sanctuary in the beautiful and exotic room above Cheng's shop. As Cheng nurses Lucy back to health, the two form a bond as two unwanted outcasts of society. When Lucyâs father gets wind of his daughter's whereabouts, he drags her back to their home to punish her. Fearing for her life, Lucy locks herself inside a closet to escape her brutal father.
By the time Cheng arrives to rescue Lucy, it is too late. Lucyâs lifeless body lies on her bed as her father drinks in another room. Cheng gazes at Lucyâs youthful face which, in spite of the circumstances, beams with innocence. Her father enters the room to make his escape. The two stand for a long while, exchanging spiteful glances, until Battling Burrows lunges for Cheng with a hatchet. Cheng retaliates by shooting Burrows repeatedly with his handgun. After returning to his home with Lucyâs body, Cheng builds a shrine to Buddha and takes his own life with a knife to the stomach.
The most-discussed scene in "Broken Blossoms" is the "closet" scene. Gish writhes in the claustrophobic space like a tortured animal who knows there is no escape. Critic Richard Schickel writes, "It is heartbreakingÂ â yet for the most part quite delicately controlled by the actress. Barthelmess reports that her hysteria was induced by Griffithâs taunting of her. Gish claims that she improvised the childâs tortured movements on the spot and that when she finished the scene there was a hush on stage. Griffith then exclaimed, 'My God, why didnât you warn me you were going to do that?'â. The scene also demonstrates Griffith's ability to create an aural effect with only an image. Gish's screams apparently attracted such a crowd outside the studio that people needed to be held back.

Monsters University

Monsters University is a 2013 computer-animated comedy movie. It is a prequel to "Monsters, Inc." that has Sulley and Mike at university before they became friends. It was directed by Dan Scanlon and produced by Kori Rae. John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi reprised their voice-roles as Sulley, Mike, and Randall for the movie.
A second movie of "Monsters, Inc." had been planned since 2005. Following disagreements between then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner and then-Pixar owner Steve Jobs, Disney (who at the time owned the rights to make sequels to all of Pixar's films until the movie "Cars" was released) announced that a sequel to "Monsters, Inc." would be made by Circle 7 Animation. Circle 7 were also working on an early draft of "Toy Story 3" at the time.
The movie was originally going to be named "Monsters, Inc. 2: Lost in Scaradise". The movie would have been about Mike and Sulley visiting the human world to give Boo a birthday present. However, they find out that she had moved to a different house. After getting trapped in the human world, Mike and Sulley split up after disagreeing on what to do (Sulley wanting to look for Boo, Mike wanting to find a way to get back to Monstropolis).
Screenwriters Rob Muir and Bob Hilgenberg were hired to write the script. They storyboarded an early draft of the script.
A sequel made by Pixar was officially announced in 2010. The movie was originally planned to be released on November 16, 2012. However, it was later changed to November 2, 2012 (eleven years to the day after the release of its predecessor) to avoid direct competition with "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn â Part 2". On April 5, 2011, it was announced that the film's release date had been pushed back farther to June 21, 2013 due to the success of Pixar movies that are released in the summer. This is according to Disney distribution executive Chuck Viane. It will be the studios' fourteenth feature film.
In early 2011, there were claims that "Monsters, Inc. 2" was going to be a prequel which focuses on Sulley and Mike's studies at the University of Fear, where they start off as rivals but soon become best friends. This is similar to how Woody and Buzz Lightyear start off in the first "Toy Story". On March 29, 2011, it was confirmed that the movie will indeed be a prequel and the new title "Monsters University" was shown. The movie will be directed by Dan Scanlon and produced by Kori Rae. It was also announced that John Goodman, Billy Crystal and Steve Buscemi will be reprising their roles. New voice cast includes Dave Foley, Julia Sweeney, Joel Murray, and Peter Sohn.
On August 12, 2011 Billy Crystal went to a 20th anniversary screening of "City Slickers". When he was asked about his return to the role of Mike Wazowski he said, "That's why I'm a little hoarse. I spent five-and-a-half hours today for our fourth session on "Monsters Inc. 2"." Crystal has said that he and co-star John Goodman are having a blast together and describes the script as "really great" and "hilarious". Crystal also gave little details of the story of the movie. He described, "It's college pranks with monsters. And I wear a retainer. Mike has a retainer."

Testaverde was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1987. He struggled with them and went on to play for the Cleveland Browns. In 1996 with the new Baltimore Ravens, Testaverde threw 33 touchdown passes, over 4,100 passing yards, and 19 interceptions. He struggled again in 1997, and went on to the New York Jets, where he had success. Over his later career, Testaverde bounced around the league as a backup for multiple teams. In his final NFL season in 2007, Testaverde and David Carr split time. Testaverde later announced his retirement.
Testaverde holds several NFL records, but not all are positive. He has thrown a touchdown in 21 consecutive seasons. He has the most losses by a starting quarterback with 123. He has thrown touchdown passes to an NFL record 70 different players.

Chelation

Chelation refers to the bonding of elemental atoms that cannot normally be bonded. For example, Sodium is a metal element that can bond with many other elements, like chlorine (forming common table salt: NaCl), or hydrogen and oxygen (Sodium hydroxide). The reason for this is that the way that atoms bond with each other is similar to a jigsaw puzzle: Only the proper shape can fit into the empty space made by the other pieces. However, with atoms, it's a bit different. For each element, the atom carries a certain number of electrons in orbit around its nucleus. Sometimes these orbits are split into levels, and only a certain number of electrons can fill each orbit before moving to a higher orbit. 
Sometimes, an orbit level is not filled all the way and can only be filled with electrons from another element with a smaller number of electrons in a higher level. When the atoms bond together, the electrons are traded between the two equally and create a very strong bond.
However, there are a few elements that cannot bond with many other elements, because they have orbits that are already filled, or nearly filled, equally. (Like a finished jigsaw puzzle) These elements can sometimes be poisonous to a human, and cannot be removed easily (for example, mercury.) Chelation enables a non-bonding element to bond, thereby enabling removal.

Mother's Day is a holiday that celebrates mothers and motherhood. It started in the United States. The holiday was founded in 1908 by Anna Jarvis. Mother's Day was first made to celebrate a person's own mother. Now it is made to celebrate all mothers and motherhood in general. It is celebrated in different times in different countries. In the United States of America, it is the second Sunday in May. Children can make cards and a lot of other things for their mother.
The idea for Mother's Day started in the 1850s. Ann Reeves Jarvis had mother's day work clubs where women tried to fight disease and bad milk. They also helped make hurt soldiers better during the Civil War. After the war, Ann made Mother's Day Friendship picnics and Mother's Friendship Day for the women from both sides of the war.
In 1908 after her mother died, Anna Jarvis made the first Mother's Day celebration in Grafton, West Virginia. People also celebrated in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and many other cities. For six years, Anna made the celebration bigger until President Woodrow Wilson made it a national holiday in 1914.

Alimentary canal

Alimentary canal is the term used in zoology for the gut of animals. For humans in particular, see human gastrointestinal tract.
The canal (or tube) is in bilaterian animals. It carries food through digestion and excretion. Into the tube come various digestive enzymes. Gut flora also help digestion. Muscular movements pass the material down the tube. The gut usually has an exit, the anus, by which the animal disposes of solid wastes. Some small animals have no anus and dispose of solid wastes by other means, for example through the mouth.
Animals that have guts are classified as either protostomes or deuterostomes, as the gut evolved twice, an example of convergent evolution. They are distinguished by the development of their embryos. Protostomes develop their mouths first, while deuterostomes develop their mouths second. Protostome include arthropods, molluscs, and annelids, while deuterostomes include echinoderms and chordates.

Xenoturbella

Xenoturbella is a genus of bilaterian animals; it contains two marine worm-like species. The first known species was discovered in 1915 but was only described in 1949. A 2003 DNA study has shown it is a primitive deuterostome phylum. The genus was the first member of its subphylum (the Xenoturbellida) to be discovered. 
This phylum is basal within the deuterostomes. It is related to the Acoelomorpha, forming a sister clade to the echinoderms and hemichordates. Other members of this phylum are now known.
"Xenoturbella" has a very simple body plan: it has no brain, no through gut, no excretory system, no organized gonads (but does have gametes), or any other organs except for a statocyst containing flagellated cells. It has cilia and a diffuse nervous system. The animal is up to long, and has been found off the coasts of Sweden, Scotland and Iceland.
The association of specimens of "Xenoturbella" with mollusc larva has led many to suggest that they are molluscivores. However, another idea is that the "Xenoturbella" larval stage develops as an internal parasite of certain molluscs.
The genus "Xenoturbella" contains two species:

Christian VII of Denmark

Christian VII of Denmark (29 January 1749 â 13 March 1808) was the King of Denmark and Norway from 1766 to 1808, and the duke of Schleswig and Holstein. He was the son of King Frederick V of Denmark and Louise of Great Britain. 
He lost his mother at the age of three. His stepmother, Juliana Maria of Brunswick-WolfenbÃ¼ttel, did not take an interest in him, and preferred her own son, Frederik. Christian suffered from epileptic seizures. His educator, Count Detlev of Reventlow, educated him very severely, locking him up in dark chambers for hours at times. Starting at an early age, Christian showed signs of mental illness. At age 17, he was married to his cousin, Caroline Matilda of Great Britain. Caroline Matilde bore a son, the future King Frederick VI of Denmark. 
When he became king, his cabinet ruled, much like in his father's time. The cabinet was led by Count Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff. When he toured Europe, he met Johann Friedrich Struensee, a medical doctor, who was influenced by the ideas of Enlightenment. Struensee soon gained influence at the court. Struensee initiated a number of liberal reforms. He also became the lover of queen Louise, who Christan neglected. In the year 1771, Princess Louise Auguste of Denmark was born. People think that Struensee was probably her father. Struensee was executed on 28 April 1772 outside the gates of Copenhagen. The queen was banned from the court. One of the last decrees of Struensee was to create the town of Christiansfeld, where people from the Moravian Church found shelter.
After the execution, Ove HÃ¸egh-Guldberg led the kingdom, supported by Queen Juliane and her son. Many of Struensee's reforms were undone. Andreas Peter Bernstorff stepped down in 1780. In the year 1784, Christian's son Frederick took power, reigning in the place of his father. Frederick was influenced by Enligtenment, and made a number of reforms; for example, the abolition of serfdom. Ernst Heinrich von Schimmelmann was made minister of finances. Together with Christian Ditlev Reventlow they boosted trade. Von Bernstorff returned to power in 1784, and was a strong supporter of the neutrality of Denmark. There was an economic boom.
Christian VII died in 1808 as a result of a stroke.

Cycliophora

The Cycliophora are a new phylum, based on a single genus Symbion. They are so different from other animals that they were put in their own phylum. They were discovered in 1995, and are the most recent new phylum. So far, three species have been found.
They live on the bodies of cold-water lobsters. They are microscopic: the feeding stage is about 0.3Â mm long, and 0.1 mm wide.
Their life style is commensal, (a form of symbiosis) â they feed on the leftovers from the lobster's own meals.
They have three different body forms, and a two-stage life-cycle.
"Symbion" can reproduce both asexually by budding and sexually. In sexual reproduction the male attaches to a feeding stage and impregnates a budding female. The female then separates from the feeding stage and attaches herself to another host, where the larva in her develops. The female dies, and the larva escapes. 
The sexual reproductive cycle is triggered when the host crustacean moults its 'shell' (exoskeleton) in order to grow.

'Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi (7 December 903 â 25 May 986), known as al-Sufi, was a Persian astronomer. The lunar crater Azophi and the minor planet 12621 Alsufi are named after him. Al-Sufi wrote his "Book of Fixed Stars" in 964, in text and pictures.
Al-Sufi was one of the nine noted Muslim astronomers. His name implies that he was a Sufi Muslim. He lived at the court of Emir Adud ad-Daula in Isfahan, Persia. He translated and expanded Greek astronomical works, especially the "Almagest" of Ptolemy. He made several corrections to Ptolemy's star-list and did his own brightness and magnitude estimates which often differed from those in Ptolemy's work.
He was a major translator into Arabic of the Hellenistic astronomy done mainly in Alexandria. This was the first attempt to connect the Greek with the traditional Arabic star names and constellations, which had been unrelated and overlapped in complicated ways.
He identified the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is visible from Yemen, though not from Isfahan. It was not seen by Europeans until Magellan's voyage in the 16th century. He also made the earliest recorded observation of the Andromeda Galaxy in 964 AD; describing it as a "small cloud". These were the first galaxies other than the Milky Way to be observed from Earth.
He observed that the ecliptic plane is inclined with respect to the celestial equator and more accurately calculated the length of the tropical year. He observed and described the stars, their positions, their magnitudes and their colour, setting out his results constellation by constellation. For each constellation, he provided two drawings, one from the outside of a celestial globe, and the other from the inside (as seen from the earth).
Al-Sufi also wrote about the astrolabe, finding numerous additional uses for it: he described over 1000 different uses, in areas as diverse as astronomy, astrology, horoscopes, navigation, surveying, timekeeping, Qibla, Salah prayer, etc.

Field Marshal Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts Bt VC KG KP GCB OM GCSI GCIE KStJ PC (30 September 1832 â 14 November 1914) was one of the most distinguished commanders of the British Empire.
Roberts was Indian born, in Cawnpore (now Kanpur) Uttar Pradesh. The son of a general from County Waterford in Ireland, he regarded himself as Anglo-Irish. 
He served in the Indian rebellion, the Expedition to Abyssinia and the Second Anglo-Afghan War before leading British Forces to success in the Second Boer War. He also became the last Commander-in-Chief of the Forces before the post was abolished in 1904.
Roberts was awarded the Victoria Cross for actions on 2 January 1858 at Khudaganj. The citation reads:
In an important speech in Manchester on 22 October 1912 Roberts warned of the threat posed by Germany:
In the year 1912, just as in 1866 and just as in 1870, war will take place the instant the German forces by land and sea are, by their superiority at every point, as certain of victory as anything in human calculation can be made certain...We may stand still. Germany always advances and the direction of her advance, the line along which she is moving, is now most manifest. It is towards...complete supremacy by land and sea.
He claimed that Germany was making enormous efforts to prepare for war and ended his speech by saying:
Gentlemen, I say, âArm and prepare to acquit yourselves like men, for the day of your ordeal is at handâ.
This speech was much criticised in the liberal and radical press, such as the "Manchester Guardian". Much later, a historian said: "At this distance of time the verdict upon Lord Robert's Manchester speech must be that, in speaking out clearly on the probability of war, he was doing a patriotic service comparable to Churchill's during the Thirties".
Roberts died on November 14, 1914. He died of pneumonia. He got sick when he was visiting British troops. Few non-royal people in four centuries have been given a State Funeral in the United Kingdom. Roberts was one of them.
Robert's son, Frederick Hugh Sherston Roberts, died in 1899 in the second Boar War, and received the VC. They were one of only three father and son pairs to receive the Victoria Cross.

Montreal Impact's biggest rival is Toronto FC because of Canada's two largest cities having shared multiple rivalries. Montreal and Toronto professional soccer teams have competed against each other for over 40 years. From the original North American Soccer League, as well as the Canadian Soccer League and the A-League, the rivalry has continued through many different leagues they have played up until the past few years where both cities would still occasionally meet for the Canadian Championships. Since both teams have joined the MLS, the rivalry is more intense and the matches have become a Canadian soccer classic called the 401 Derby.

Hurricane Floyd (1987)

Hurricane Floyd was the only hurricane to make landfall in the United States during the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the last of seven tropical storms and three hurricanes. Floyd developed on 9 October just off the east coast of Nicaragua. It then became a tropical storm. After this, it moved northward and crossed western Cuba. Because a cold front was approaching, Floyd suddenly turned to the northeast. Late on 12 October it became a hurricane near the Florida Keys. It moved through the south of Florida. It produced two tornadoes and caused some damage. The hurricane also produced rip tides. This killed one person in southern Texas. Floyd was a hurricane for only twelve hours. After this, because of the cold front, it became weak. It passed through the Bahamas before becoming extratropical. It dissipated on 14 October.
Hurricane Floyd originated from a low pressure area in the Gulf of Honduras on October 5. It drifted eastward in the next few days. Then, it moved southward. It moved to a place off the east coast of Nicaragua. On OctoberÂ 9, a Hurricane Hunters flight confirmed that an organized circulation was formed. This showed that the year's thirteenth tropical depression had developed. It drifted more to the south. Then the depression turned to the north and later northwest. This was because a ridge was formed to its east. With an anticyclone over it, the depression gradually organized. It then became stronger and was named Tropical Storm Floyd on OctoberÂ 10.
After it became a tropical storm, Floyd accelerated to the north in the western Caribbean Sea. This was because a cold front was approaching. It steadily became more intense. The storm moved over extreme western Cuba early on OctoberÂ 12. Initially it was forecast to make landfall in the United States between Naples and Fort Myers, Florida. Suddenly, the storm moved sharply northeastward. It went into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. The Hurricane Hunters gave reports which said Floyd got the status of a hurricane on OctoberÂ 12 for a short time. Around the same time, the nearby cold front created a low pressure area. This cut off the hurricane's inflow. While moving through the Florida Keys, Floyd became the only hurricane to affect the United States that year. However, its convection was decreasing very fast over the center due to the front. Soon after this, Floyd weakened to tropical storm status. The circulation became nearly impossible to track on satellite imagery. But surface observations showed it passed just south of Miami. The storm turned extratropical. It went to a process called extratropical transition, meaning it was changed from tropical storm to an extratropical one. This happened as it weakened over the Bahamas. Floyd was no longer a tropical cyclone by late on OctoberÂ 18. The circulation dissipated within the cold front early the next day.
Around when Floyd first became a tropical storm, a tropical storm warning was issued for the Swan Islands and Grand Cayman. Soon after this, a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the northeast YucatÃ¡n Peninsula. The storm caused heavy rainfall along the coast after this warning was issued. A tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were also issued for Cuba west of Havana. To prepare themselves for the storm, Cuban officials in Pinar del RÃ­o Province evacuated 100,000Â people, as well as 40,000Â head of cattle. International flights were also canceled for a day when Floyd was passing. Floyd passed over Western Cuba as a tropical storm. But it left no serious damage or killed anyone in the country. 
When Floyd was a tropical storm located over Cuba, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for the Florida Keys. The southwest Florida coast to Venice also got a warning. It was the first warning in the state related to the storm. It was issued as the National Hurricane Center anticipated Floyd to become more intense into a hurricane. It was also issued because there was not much time left for this. A tropical storm watch, and then a warning, was issued for eastern Florida too. But the track became more easterly after this. So, a hurricane warning was issued for southeastern Florida. It was also issued for the northwestern Bahamas. Officials in southern Florida closed schools due to the storm. A few flights were canceled at Miami International Airport. About 100 F-4 and F16 fighter jets were transported out of Homestead Air Force Base to safer places. The American Red Cross opened 55Â shelters in 10 Florida counties. They had 2,000Â people at some point. This was mainly in Lee County. People in the hurricane's path prepared by buying supplies from supermarkets, keeping the gas in their vehicles full and keeping loose outside items safe.
Floyd was the first named storm to strike southern Florida in two years. The last one was Hurricane Bob in 1985. While passing south of Florida, Floyd produced its strongest winds over water away and from land. The strongest wind in the Florida Keys was 59Â mph (94Â km/h) at Duck Key. But wind gusts were stronger. The Air Force station on Cudjoe Key reported an unofficial gust of 92Â mph (152Â km/h). Rainfall directly from Floyd's rainbands was very low, about . But, the interaction between the hurricane and the approaching cold front caused much heavier rainfall. It reached as far north as Daytona. The highest rainfall was in Fort Pierce. Floyd created a waterspout that moved ashore in Rock Harbor. It damaged a few boats and homes. The hurricane produced rip tides. They went far west as the Texas coast. It killed one person along South Padre Island.
Across southern Florida, the hurricane left minor damage of around $500,000 (1987Â USD). This was largely due to falling of trees and damaging of power lines. There was also minor crop damage in Dade County. The rainfall flooded roads in southern Florida. This caused several vehicles to fail on the Florida Turnpike. After affecting Florida, Floyd caused minor wind damage in the Bahamas. In the country, the highest reported gust was . This was at Freeport, Grand Bahama. Freeport International Airport reported sustained winds of from the remnants of Floyd.

Caramel

) is a beige to dark-brown sweet food. It is made by heating sugars. It is used to add flavour to puddings and desserts. It can also be as a filling, like is done in bonbons, and as a topping for ice cream, custard and coffee.
Simple sugar (Sucrose) starts to melt at about , without changing its color. The process called caramelisation starts when sugar is heated to at least , and more often to around . As the sugar heats, the molecules break down and turn into compounds with the colour and flavour of caramel.
Many candies and desserts are made with caramel. Some of these are caramel apples, pralines, nougats, brittles, "crÃ¨me caramel", and "crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e".
Caramel candy is a soft, dense, chewy candy. It is made by boiling a mixture of milk or cream, sugar(s), butter, and vanilla flavouring. The sugar(s) are heated separately to reach . This turns them to caramel before the other ingredients are added. Another way of doing this is to cook all ingredients together. This way, the milk turns to caramel but the sugars do not. This type of candy is often called "milk caramel" or "cream caramel".
Caramel coloring is a dark bitter-tasting liquid. It is what is made after near-total caramelisation. It is then bottled to be used for other things. It is used as food coloring and in beverages like cola.
Caramel sauce is made from heating water and caster sugar at a low to medium temperature. This is done until the sugar dissolves and "caramelises". This changes its colour to golden brown.

Cartoon Network

Cartoon Network is an American television channel. It broadcasts television programs that are suitable for young children. Most of the shows are animated cartoon series, but some live-action shows are also broadcast. However, at night Cartoon Network switches to Adult Swim which broadcasts programs for teens instead.
Cartoon Network first launched in October 1, 1992 through cable and satellite television in the United States by Turner Broadcasting System (or TBS for short). In the early years, many of the shows featured on the channel were classic cartoons and Hanna-Barbera shows. TBS later launched Cartoon Network Studios to make flagship original shows specifically for Cartoon Network.
After successfully launching the channel in the United States, TBS decided to launch the channel in other countries. The Cartoon Network channels in other countries distributes Cartoon Network's original shows in different languages.

August Bournonville

August Bournonville (21 August 1805 â 30 November 1879) was a Danish ballet master and choreographer. He studied in Paris as a young man. He became a solo dancer with the Royal Danish Ballet in Copenhagen. He became the company's choreographer from 1830 to 1877. He created more than 50 ballets. Only a limited number survive. It was only after World War II that his ballets became known outside Denmark. 
His work is a link with earlier ballet traditions. He avoided the excesses of romantic ballet. He gave equal emphasis to both the male and female dancer. The extremes of human nature were tempered in his work and a more balanced picture of human nature emerged. His ballets include "Napoli" and "The Conservatory".

Napoli (ballet)

Napoli is a ballet in three acts. The story of the ballet and the dances are the work of August Bournonville. The music was written by E. Helsted, Gade, and Paulli. "Napoli" was first danced by the Royal Danish Ballet in Copenhagen on 29 March 1842. "Napoli" has not changed over the years. It is danced in Copenhagen today exactly as it was danced in 1842. It is said to be Bournonville's greatest ballet.
The beautiful Neapolitan girl Teresina loves Gennaro, a fisherman. Gennaro and Teresina sail out into the Gulf of Naples. A storm washes Teresina into the sea. Gennaro sets out to save her. Teresina has been taken to the blue grotto (a rocky cave) by sea sprites. The grotto is the home of the powerful sprite Golfo. He plans to keep Teresina in the grotto. He changes her into a sprite. Gennaro sails into the grotto. He prays to the Madonna and Teresina becomes herself again. Gennaro and Teresina go back to Naples. The people believe Teresina was saved through witchcraft. A priest says it was a miracle. The people are happy. Teresina and Gennaro marry.

Marie Taglioni

Marie Taglioni (18041884) was a ballerina. She was born in Stockholm, Sweden on April 23, 1804. Her father was the choreographer Filippo Taglioni. He created the seminal romantic ballet "La Sylphide" to showcase her talents.
She was the first ballerina to dance "en pointe" for the sake of artistry rather than spectacle. She created a scandal when she shortened her ballet skirts to display her footwork.
She danced mostly in London at Her Majesty's Theatre and in Paris at the OpÃ©ra. In 1827, she began a three-year stint with the Imperial Ballet in St Petersburg. She danced in "Pas de Quatre" with Carlotta Grisi, Lucille Grahn, and Fanny Cerrito in July 1845. She retired in 1847 and lived in Venice, Italy.
She was the guiding spirit behind the reorganization of the Paris OpÃ©ra Ballet. In later life, she taught social dances to children and society ladies. She also took a limited number of ballet pupils. Johann Strauss II composed the "Marie Taglioni Polka, Op. 173" in her honour. She died in Marseilles on April 24, 1884.

Curiosity

Curiosity is an emotion that shows a want or need to know new things. It is shown in behavior such as exploration, investigation, and learning. It is an innate behaviour of humans and many animal species. Curiosity is a major cause and force behind scientific research and other studies. 
Curiosity is common to humans at all ages starting from infancy, through adulthood. It is easy to see in many other animal species, such as apes, cats, rodents, fish, reptiles, and insects. Although it is an innate behaviour of many living beings, it is not thought of as an instinct because it is not a fixed action pattern.
A "morbid curiosity" is an addictive curiosity with death, violence, or something else that may hurt you physically or emotionally.

Indoor Football League

The Indoor Football League (IFL) is a professional indoor American football league created in 2008 out of the combination of the Intense Football League and United Indoor Football. For the 2011 season the league had 22 teams in 14 different U.S. states. The 2012 season has 16 teams. There championship is called the United Bowl. They play games in the Spring.
In 2008, the league was created due to tension between in the Intense Football League and United Indoor Football League.
The 2009 IFL United Bowl had the Intense Conference champs, the Billings Outlaws, against the upset-minded United Conference River City Rage. Scoring was common. The Outlaw defense had a pick in the 2nd quarter which led to another offensive touchdown and two score lead by halftime. The Rage fought back though, recovering an onside kick at the beginning of the 3rd quarter and driving the ball the length of the field for a touchdown. That would be the closest the game would get for the Rage. The Outlaws would put up just enough points to keep a comfortable lead throughout the fourth quarter and after recovering an onside kick in the last minute of the game, the Outlaws kneeled the ball and took home the crown with a score of 71-62 in a loud, sold out Rimrock Auto Arena.
In the 2010 IFL United Bowl, the Billings Outlaws of the Intense Conference took the league championship by beating Sioux Falls Storm of the United Conference 43-34 in front of a sold out crowd in the Billings Sportsplex (a training facility, used by the Outlaws after their arena suffered storm damage).
The IFL got more attention when former National Football League star wide receiver Terrell Owens joined the Allen Wranglers of the IFL for the 2012 season.

Malay race

The Malay race is a theoretical race that was first proposed by the German scientist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752â1840). Blumenbach described five races, and classified them by the colour of people's skin. The Malay race was classified as the brown race. Since Blumenbach, many anthropologists have rejected his theory of five races. Most agree that classifying races is more complicated than Blumenbach allowed for. The Malay race is a concept. It has no connection with the ethnic group of Malays.
The term "Malay race" was often used in the late 19th century and early 20th century to describe the Austronesian peoples.

I discovered that article today and expanded it greatly based on the of that article from the English Wikipedia. I simplified it as good as I can and also added some more references to it. It's been some years since I've nominated an article for GA here, so I guess there might be some issues to be fixed. Any help is really appreciated! - 15:27, 8 March 2012 (UTC)
On closer inspection, it appears that Factoidz.com might not be a reliable reference. Its writers, though paid per contribution, are random individuals who have signed up to the website. The only other thing I might suggest is a brief "history" section, so that the lead can remain a summary and not contain facts not detailed further in the body. I fixed a typo and merged some duplicate citations. Regards, () 03:22, 10 March 2012 (UTC)
Looking great, I'll get to work filling in the two red links. - () 21:59, 10 March 2012 (UTC)
It looks like a good article. I quickly filled in the Great Slave Lake red link and made a few small simplifications. () 12:52, 12 March 2012 (UTC)
The article is generally looking good. My only concern (and this affects a lot of articles we have) is the use of complex language in the info box. I do not think we should have any redlinks in an info box for a PGA. But I also wonder what we can do to simplify the language in infoboxes generally.-- () 20:36, 13 March 2012 (UTC)

Oppose, yet again. For me, not a specially good article. The intro, which has no references, claims 500,000 copies of the video were sold. Proof? And what, exactly, was sold, and how?

I come back a month later, and I see improvement, but do not think it makes GA. There is a through-and-through confusion between what is true of all spiders of this type and what is true of this species. â¢ Example: "The blood cannot flow through their legs while they walk, so they must stop every few seconds to allow the blood to flow". As far as I know, this is true and characteristic of all spiders. It's the way their legs are constructed, and boy, is that a basal trait. And so, obviously, is not characteristic of this species. Incidentally, blood doesn't flow in arthropods the same way it does in us because they don't have blood vessels. They have a sort of internal soup called a haemolymph. I imagine chemicals just diffuse to and fro. They do have a sort of heart, and muscular movements help the goo get round. Just thought you'ld like to know!
â¢ Example: "Scientists who study brown recluses and their relatives can even identify relatives of the brown recluse by studying the shapes of the sex organs". Since I once occupied a lab space next to someone who was doing a PhD on the genitalia of spiders, I can confidently say that's how all closely similar spiders are identified. Spider genitalia work on a lock-and key fit which serves to prevent hybridisation between species. They just can't do it with the species next door...
â¢ On another matter, the last sentence is a victim of WP:Citation overkill. Either you've left something out, or you don't need that many references.
â¢ Flies and moths are not 'soft'. They can be remarkably tough. However, they're not so robust as cockroaches, beetles and some bumblebees. What is soft (in insect terms) are caterpillars and other larvae, and some of those are no pushover, either. However, all spiders are remarkable predators. It's what they do. There seems to be no data on how this particular spider goes about its normal killing.
It's difficult to work on the basis of such a poor article as the one in enWP. Well, this doesn't make it for me. Sorry. () 20:26, 21 June 2012 (UTC)

The references still need cleaning up. It looks like you've used the parameter in the citation templates to say how many pages there are in the book, which we don't really need to know... That parameter is used in "footnotes" when referencing a segment of the book that runs across more than one page. It shouldn't be used in the bulleted bibliography, and you would use instead of if referencing only one page. Some of the footnotes (1, 4, 5, etc) could use more detail, like a publisher, access date, publication date if known. And I think most people will need convincing that "eHow.com" is a reliable reference.
I think for a good article, we should have a map that is in English, and the key should be text-based (not part of the image) for accessibility reasons. The images could use also but that isn't a requirement of course. () 00:07, 12 June 2012 (UTC)
I've fixed the conflicting information that Barras is talking about, but you need to combine those two sentences on the weight and size in the "Adults" section if (according to the information in the start of the "Reproduction" section) they are both about females. I also don't get why that information is being repeated. Is the weight and size of adult frogs immediately relevant to reproduction? The first four sentences of that section don't seem to be about reproduction at all.
It looks like this is considered a pest or invasive species in many countries, but there isn't any information on this. Could you perhaps add a paragraph on the status of the species in countries other than its native one? () 05:55, 8 July 2012 (UTC)
Sorry, Jona, I've had a more thorough look at this and have a few more concerns - but nothing that can't be fixed.

I have tried very hard to keep this article simple, but comprehensive. As far as I can tell the only requirement that may still be short is on red links. I'm working on those ... see the article's Talk Page for a list.

Subalpine zone

The subalpine zone is the zone of plants just below tree line around the world. Species that occur in the zone vary according to where they are on the Earth. For example, Snow Gum in Australia, or Subalpine Larch, Mountain Hemlock and Subalpine Fir in western North America.
Trees in the subalpine zone often become crooked, stunted and twisted in form. At treeline, tree seedlings may germinate on the lee (sheltered) side of rocks and grow only as high as the rock shelters them from wind. Further growth is more horizontal than vertical, and additional rooting may occur where branches touch the soil. Snow cover may protect trees during the winter, but branches higher than wind-shelters or snow cover are usually destroyed. Well-established trees may be several hundred to a thousand years old.
Montane grassland and shrubs may be found in the subalpine zone. Tuolumne Meadows in the Sierra Nevada of California is an example of a subalpine meadow.

The movie was directed by Vincente Minnelli. He met Garland on the set. Later, they married. The critics liked the movie. In 2005, Richard Schickel wrote, "It had wonderful songs [and] a sweetly unneurotic performance by Judy Garland ... Despite its nostalgic charm, Minnelli infused the piece with a dreamy, occasionally surreal, darkness and it remains, for some of us, the greatest of American movie musicals."
The movie was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Cinematography, Color, Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture, Best Music, Song ("The Trolley Song") and Best Writing, Screenplay. In 1994, the movie was chosen for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

Judy Garland as gay icon

American actress and songstress Judy Garland is a gay icon. She rose to iconic status in the 1950s. At that time, gays admired her talent as a performer, and her value as a camp figure. She was often parodied in drag revues. Her struggles with drugs, booze, and personal relationships during her glory days mirrored similar struggles among urban closeted gays during the same era. Garland's role as Dorothy Gale in "The Wizard of Oz" may be the foundation stone of her iconic status. Following her death in 1969 and the Stonewall riots, Garland's status as a gay icon began to slip. Young gay men embraced their sexual orientation with pride rather than shame, and could or would not identify with Garland's melodramatic victimhood and emotionalism.
Judy Garland was born Francis Ethel Gumm in Grand Rapids, Minnesota in 1922. Her parents were vaudevillians who operated a movie theatre that featured vaudeville acts. Judy was a toddler when she joined her two older sisters in singing "Jingle Bells" from the stage of her parents' theatre. The sisters performed as The Gumm Sisters for the next few years. The Gumms moved to Lancaster, California in 1926 when Judy's father was rumored to be making sexual advances to young male theatre ushers. 
The Gumm Sisters continued to perform successfully. They made their movie debut in 1929. In 1934 they changed their name to The Garland Sisters. Judy was signed by MGM in 1935 and made many movies including the Andy Hardy series with Mickey Rooney and "The Wizard of Oz". Judy was given amphetamines and barbiturates to keep up with the hectic pace of moviemaking. She became addicted to drugs.
Judy was insecure about her appearance. Her feelings were exacerbated by cruel studio executives. In April 1947 she had a nervous breakdown and was placed in a sanitarium. In July she tried to commit suicide. She was released from the studio in 1950, but found a new lease on life performing on the concert stage. Her personal life was troubled with drugs and alcohol. She was married five times, four marriages ending in divorce. She died in London in 1969 of an accidental drug overdose. Thousands attended her funeral in New York City.
Gay identification with Garland as a tragic figure was being discussed as early as 1967. "Time" magazine reviewed Garland's 1967 Palace Theatre engagement in New York City, and wrote that a "disproportionate part of her nightly claque seems to be homosexual." The review goes on to say that "[t]he boys in the tight trousers" (a phrase "Time" repeatedly used to describe gay men) would "roll their eyes, tear at their hair and practically levitate from their seats" during Garland's performances. 
"Time" tried to explain Garland's appeal to the homosexual. Psychiatrists thought that "the attraction [to Garland] might be made considerably stronger by the fact that she has survived so many problems; homosexuals identify with that kind of hysteria". They speculated that "Judy was beaten up by life, embattled, and ultimately had to become more masculine. She has the power that homosexuals would like to have, and they attempt to attain it by idolizing her."
William Goldman wrote in "Esquire" magazine about the same Palace engagement. He too disparages the gay men in attendance. He dismisses them as "fags" who "flit by" chattering inanely. He also advances the tragic figure concept. He suggests that "if [homosexuals] have an enemy, it is age. And Garland is youth, perennially, over the rainbow." He wrote, "Homosexuals tend to identify with suffering. They are a persecuted group and they understand suffering. And so does Garland. She's been through the fire and lived â all the drinking and divorcing, all the pills and all the men, all the poundage come and gone â brothers and sisters, "she knows.""
Gay movie scholar Richard Dyer has defined camp as "a characteristically gay way of handling the values, images and products of the dominant culture through irony, exaggeration, trivialisation, theatricalisation and an ambivalent making fun of and out of the serious and respectable." Garland is camp, he asserts, because she is "imitable, her appearance and gestures copiable in drag acts". He calls her "ordinariness" in her early MGM movies camp in their "failed seriousness" and her later style "wonderfully over-the-top." 
Garland herself acknowledged her camp appeal during her lifetime. She once said, "When I die I have visions of fags singing 'Over the Rainbow' and the flag at Fire Island being flown at half mast." Fire Island is a resort community that lies off Long Island. It has a large LGBT presence. The Island is also referenced in Garland's last movie "I Could Go On Singing". The movie is described as "her most gay film" and as the movie most aware of its gay audience.
Another connection between Garland and LGBT people is the slang term "Friend of Dorothy". This term likely derives from Garland's portrayal of Dorothy Gale in "The Wizard of Oz". It became a code phrase gay people used to identify each other. Dorothy's journey from Kansas to Oz "mirrored many gay men's desires to escape the black-and-white limitations of small town life ... for big, colorful cities filled with quirky, gender-bending characters who would welcome them." 
In the movie, Dorothy immediately accepts those who are different. The Lion identifies himself through song as a "sissy" and exhibits stereotypically "gay" (or at least effeminate) mannerisms. The Lion is seen as a coded example of Garland meeting and accepting a gay man without question.
It has been said that Garland's death and funeral, held in New York City in June 1969, helped inspire the Stonewall riots. However, some observers of the riots contend that most of those involved "were not the type to moon over Judy Garland records or attend her concerts at Carnegie Hall. They were more preoccupied with where they were going to sleep and where their next meal would come from." In a 2009 interview, gay historian David Carter stated that this connection was based on a mocking reference to the riot by an anti-gay writer in the "Village Voice" the next day. There was certainly an awareness and appreciation of Garland among Stonewall Inn patrons. Because the bar had no liquor license, it was passed off as a bottle club and patrons were required to sign in. Many used pseudonyms and "Judy Garland" was among the most popular.
"Time" magazine would write decades later: "The uprising was inspirited by a potent cocktail of pent-up rage (raids of gay bars were brutal and routine), overwrought emotions (hours earlier, thousands had wept at the funeral of Judy Garland) and drugs. As a 17-year-old cross-dresser was being led into the paddy wagon and got a shove from a cop, she fought back. She hit the cop and was so stoned, she didn't know what she was doingâor didn't care. Garland's daughter Lorna Luft points to the connection with pride, saying that her mother was a "huge, huge advocate of human rights" and that Garland would have found the rioting appropriate.
The rainbow flag, a symbol of the LGBT community, may have been inspired, in part, by Garland's signature song "Over the Rainbow." Garland's performance of this song has been described as "the sound of the closet," speaking to gay men whose image "they presented in their own public lives was often at odds with a truer sense of self that mainstream society would not condone."
Judy Garland's father and other significant people in her life were gay. Garland's father Frank Gumm would apparently seduce or at least keep company with very young men or older teens. He would move on when told to leave or before his activities could be discovered. Garland's husband Vincente Minnelli was generally known to be a closeted bisexual. Garland liked to visit gay bars with openly gay friends Roger Edens and George Cukor, to the chagrin of her handlers at MGM.

Carlo Bergonzi (July 13, 1924 â 25 July 2014) was an Italian tenor. He performed in Italian operas, especially in the works of Giuseppe Verdi. He was noted for his very good musical skills and style.
Bergonzi was born in Vidalenzo, near Parma, Italy. He studied in Parma with Grandini. His first performance was in 1948 in Lecce, as Figaro in "Il Barbiere di Siviglia". For that, he sang as a baritone. After more studies, he retrained himself as a tenor. His first performance as a tenor was in 1951 in "Bari", as Andrea Chenier. That same year, on the 100th anniversary of Verdi's death, he sang on Italian radio in several Verdi works, such as "I Due Foscari", "Giovanna d'Arco", "Simon Boccanegra", etc.
He first sang at La Scala in Milan in 1953, at the Chicago Lyric Opera in 1955, the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 1956, and the Royal Opera House in London in 1962. 
He sung most of the leading roles in Italian opera, notably Nemorino, Edgardo, Ernani, Macduff, Duke of Mantua, Alfredo, Riccardo, Alvaro, Carlo, Radames, Enzo, Turriddu, des Grieux, Rodolfo, Cavaradossi, Pinkerton, etc. He made many recordings, notably a recording of Verdi's complete tenor arias. This remains a unique achievement.

2006 Chicago BearsâArizona Cardinals game

The 2006 Chicago BearsâArizona Cardinals game was a football game between the Chicago Bears and Arizona Cardinals in 2006. The game was on TV on Monday Night Football. The game took place in University of Phoenix Stadium on October 16, 2006. The Bears beat the Cardinals 24-23 after they were losing by 20 points. Bears quarterback Rex Grossman had his throws intercepted by the Cardinals defense 4 times. Despite this issue, the Bears were able to get away and won in the second half of the game. The game became famous after Cardinals coach Dennis Green became very angry in an interview with reporters, and is one of the best comebacks in NFL history.
The Cardinals started off strong, as Matt Leinart threw 2 touchdown passes. Rex Grossman wasn't as good, since the defense took the ball away from him 6 times. The Bears game back in the 3rd quarter, as kicker Robbie Gould scored the Bears first points. The Bears defense scored twice, and the Bears went ahead after rookie Devin Hester scored the game-winning touchdown on an 83-yard punt return. The Cardinals tried to come back, but their kicker Neil Rackers missed the game-winning kick.
The game reached a new level in fame for the after game interview. The calm Cardinals coach Dennis Green started yelling and complaining with bad words in the interview, and also hitting the microphone. The interview became part of a beer commercial the year later.
After the game ended, the Bears went 13-3 and went to Super Bowl XLI. They lost to the Indianapolis Colts 29-17. Grossman was later released and became part of the Houston Texans and Washington Redskins.
The Cardinals went 5-11, and Green was fired and Ken Whisenhunt became the new coach, and led Arizona to Super Bowl XLIII, and they lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-23. Leinart then was released 2 years later and joined the Texans, and is still with the team as of the 2012 NFL season.

Hines Ward

Hines E. Ward, Jr. (born March 8, 1976) is a former American football wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He played for the Pittsburgh Steelers for fourteen seasons after being drafted in the third round of the 1998 NFL Draft, becoming the team's all-time leader in receptions, receiving yardage and touchdown receptions. Ward was voted MVP of Super Bowl XL, and upon retirement was one of only eight NFL players to have 1,000 or more career receptions. He played college football at the University of Georgia.
Ward played college football for the University of Georgia Bulldogs from 1994 to 1997. Ward's 149 career catches for 1,965 yards placed him second in team history. He also played tailback and totaled 3,870 all-purpose yards, second only to Herschel Walker in Bulldogs history, and even played some quarterback. Ward wore #19 in college.
Ward won the Super Bowl twice in Pittsburgh. He was even the MVP of Super Bowl XL, in which Ward caught a touchdown from fellow wideout Antwaan Randle El. Ward is known for, not only his great receiving skills, but his hard blocks (some call them illegal, Ward was even voted the "NFL's Dirtiest Player") and signature toothy smile. In fourteen seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ward also became their all-time leading receiver. Ward also served as a mentor to several younger Steelers wideouts, including Mike Wallace, Antonio Brown, and Santonio Holmes.
Ward's play became worse late in his career, and so he was released by the Steelers before retiring.
Ward was born in Seoul, South Korea, but grew up in the Atlanta, Georgia, USA area. He made an appearance on Dancing with the Stars with Kym Johnson, even winning. Ward also has not had many major legal issues, except for a DUI in 2011, and those chargers were dropped. However, Ward pleaded guilty to "reckless driving".

David Oaks

David W. Oaks is the founder and executive director of MindFreedom International, based in Eugene, Oregon. The organization includes psychiatric survivors and dissident psychiatrists who reject what they say is the "domination" by the biomedical model that defines contemporary psychiatry. 
Oaks says that the psychiatric drugs that patients take have harmful side effects, and people can often recover without them. 
David Oaks himself was institutionalized and forcibly medicated in the 1970s, while studying at Harvard University, for what was diagnosed as schizophrenia. He recovered, he says, by rejecting drugs and getting support from family and friends. Oaks says he "maintains his mental health with exercise, diet, peer counseling and wilderness trips â strategies that are well outside the mainstream thinking of psychiatrists and many patients".
Oaks is on the board of directors for the United States International Council on Disability.

Marbles (game)

Marbles is a game played by children with small, round glass balls called 'marbles'.
The balls vary in size. Usually they are about 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.6 cm) in diameter, but they may range from less than 1/30 inch (0.111Â cm) to over 3Â inches (7.75Â cm). 
As the photographs show, the little glass balls can be most attractive, and they are often collected by children. In the North of England the objects and the game are sometimes called 'taws'. 
The games has been played in many countries, but the rules are made up by the players, and there are many variations. One standard idea is to have a target marble. Players flick their marbles with their thumbnail, and try to hit the target. Another version is where players try to hit each other's marbles out of a target zone.
Marbles were found in the ancient civilisations of Mohenjo-daro, Ancient Egypt and Rome.
Marbles has been played in Tinsley Green, West Sussex, England for many centuries: "TIME" magazine traces its origins to 1588.
The British and World Marbles Championship have been held at Tinsley Green every year since 1932. The first championship in 1932 was won by a team from the Black Horse public house in nearby Charlwood.
Traditionally, the marbles-playing season started on Ash Wednesday and lasted until midday on Good Friday: it was thought playing after that brought bad luck. More than 20 teams from around the world take part in the championship each Good Friday. German teams have been successful several times since 2000. Often, local teams from Crawley, Copthorne and other Sussex and Surrey villages also take part.

The Natural Bears Classification System

The Natural Bears Classification System (NBCS) is a set of symbols using letters, numbers, and other characters commonly found on modern, Western computer keyboards. It is used by gay and bisexual men who self-identify as "bears". These codes are used in email, Usenet, and Internet forum postings to identify the physical type and preferences of the poster. The code was developed by Bob Donahue and Jeff Stoner. The NBCS is also called the "bear code". 
An example of the bear code is "B4 s- m g++ w d+c t+ f+ k+ r e+(+?)". The translation (in no particular order) is: "Reasonably thick beard, cub tendencies, definite Daddy, (endowment) gets attention, above average fur, loves groping/pawing/touching, (Kinkiness) loves most things, (Muscle) some definition/Blue collar, spends some time outdoors, (sex) plays under special circumstances, tall, bear with a tummy".

Leather Pride Flag

The Leather Pride Flag is a symbol used by the leather subculture since the 1990s. It was designed by Tony DeBlase in 1989. 
The design was presented at the International Mr. Leather event in Chicago, Illinois, on May 28, 1989. Initial reaction to the flag was mixed. According to DeBlase's article "A Leather Pride Flag", "Some, particularly on the east coast, reacted positively to the concept, but were quite concerned, some even offended, that I had not involved the community in helping to create the design." DeBlase gave this explanation of the design: "The flag is composed of nine horizontal stripes of equal width. From the top and from the bottom, the stripes alternate black and royal blue. The central stripe is white. In the upper left quadrant of the flag is a large red heart. I will leave it to the viewer to interpret the colors and symbols."

Seven trumpets

Seven trumpets are sounded, one at a time, to cue apocalyptic events that were seen in the vision of the Revelation of Jesus, by Jonh, as written in the Book of Revelation of the New Testament. The seven trumpets are sounded by seven angels and the events that follow are described in detail from Revelation Chapters 8 to 11. According to Revelation 8:1-2, the angels sound these trumpets after the breaking of the seventh seal. These seals secured the apocalyptic document, that was in the right hand of God.

Alveolar trill

The alveolar trill is a type of consonant. It is found in some spoken languages. It is usually called the rolled R, rolling R, or trilled R. The sound of this consonant is formed by placing the tip of your tongue against the ridge just behind the top row of your teeth. This is what is meant by "alveolar". The sound is then made by vibrating your tongue against that ridge. This makes it a trill consonant.
The International Phonetic Alphabet represents dental, alveolar and postalveolar trills with the symbol â¨â©. The X-SAMPA symbol of it is r.
Quite often, we use â¨â© in phonemic transcriptions (especially those found in dictionaries) of languages like English and German. They have rhotic consonants that are not an alveolar trill. This is because typing the r will be easier in the orthographies of these languages.
In many Indo-European languages, this sound is at least occasionally allophonic with an alveolar tap , particularly in unstressed positions. Exceptions to this include Catalan, Spanish, Albanian and some Portuguese dialects, which treat them as separate phonemes.
These are some examples where the alveolar trill occurs in various languages:
Some languages have a "voiceless alveolar trill". In the normal alveolar trill, the vocal cord vibrates. In voiceless alveolar trill, the vocal cord does not vibrate. We do not often use voiceless alveolar trill, but we often use the voiced alveolar trill. We can find it in Ancient Greek, where it was spelled â¨â©; this sound has combined with in Modern Greek.
In Czech, there are two different alveolar trills. Besides the normal trill, written r, there is another, written Å. This is found in words such as "rybÃ¡Åi" ('fishermen'), ('four'), and the common surname "DvoÅÃ¡k". The way it is pronounced is similar to but the tongue is raised; it is partially fricative, with the frication sounding rather like , though not so retracted. Thus in the IPA it is written as â¨râ© plus the raising diacritic, â¨â©. (Before the 1989 IPA Kiel Convention, it had a dedicated symbol â¨â©). It is normally voiced, but there is a voiceless allophone as with many other Czech consonants.

Bilabial trill

The bilabial trill is a consonant. It is used in some spoken languages.
The International Phonetic Alphabet represents this sound as â¨â©. The X-SAMPA symbol of it is B\.
In many of the languages that contains bilabial trill, it only occurs as part of a prenasalised bilabial stop with trilled release, . This developed historically from a prenasalized stop before a relatively high back vowel, such as . In such instances, these sounds are usually still limited to the environment of a following . 
There is also voiceless alveolar bilabially trilled affricate (, sometimes "táµ"), which is not often used. It is found in PirahÃ£ and from a few words in the Chapacuran languages Wariâ and Oro Win. The sound also appears as an allophone of the labialized voiceless alveolar plosive of Abkhaz and Ubykh, but in those languages it is more often realised by a doubly articulated stop . In the Chapacuran languages, is reported almost exclusively before rounded vowels such as and .

Plutonism

Plutonism (or Vulcanism) is the theory that the rocks forming the Earth were formed in fire by volcanic activity.
It was named after Pluto, the classical ruler of the underworld, or alternatively after Vulcan, the ancient Roman god of fire and volcanoes. The theory was first proposed by AbbÃ© Anton Moro who had studied volcanic islands. It was subsequently developed by James Hutton as part of his "Theory of the Earth" published in 1788. 
The Plutonists strongly disputed the Neptunist view that rocks had been formed by processes that no longer operated, instead supporting Hutton's uniformitarianism.

Tea bag (sexual act)

Tea bag is a slang term for a sexual act in which the male puts his scrotum into his partner's mouth over and over, like a tea bag being put into a cup of hot water. Tea bagging can be an act of male domination, which he might use to humiliate his partner. Some people would not like being tea bagged, but it does not need to be painful.
Tea bagging has been used during hazing or bullying incidents. Groups hold down victims while somebody "shoved his testicles in [the victim's] face" or puts his "crotch to his head." 
Pretending to tea bag is a popular taunt in multiplayer first person shooter video games, the player who has killed the other crouches over and over on the dead body of their opponent. Although some say that it is not being a good winner, it is common in amateur, and possibly even professional gaming.

List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska

The U.S. state of Alaska is not in counties, as 48 other states are (Louisiana has parishes instead). It is in boroughs. Many of the more densely populated parts of the state are in Alaska's eighteen organized boroughs, which are somewhat similar to counties in other states. Unlike in the other 49 states, the organized boroughs do not cover all land of the state. The area not part of any organized borough is called the "unorganized borough."
For the 1970 census, the US and state made the unorganized borough into 11 census areas. Each is roughly the same as an election district. However, these areas are solely for statistical analysis and presentation. They have no government of their own. Boroughs and census areas are both treated as county-level equivalents by the Census Bureau. 
Some areas in the unorganized borough receive limited public services directly from the Alaska state government, usually law enforcement from the Alaska State Troopers and educational funding. 
Six consolidated city-county governments existâJuneau City and Borough, City and Borough of Haines, Sitka City and Borough, Yakutat City and Borough, Wrangell City and Borough, and the state's largest city, Anchorage. Though its legal name is the "Municipality of Anchorage," it is considered a consolidated city-borough under state law. 
The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 55-2,3,4 codes, used by the United States Census Bureau to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry. Alaska's code is 02, which when combined with any county code would be written as 02XXX. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county.
The Unorganized Borough is part of the U.S. state of Alaska not in any of its 18 organized boroughs. It is over half of Alaska's area, 970,500Â kmÂ² (374,712Â miÂ²), an area larger than any other US state. As of the 2000 census 13% of Alaskans (81,803 people) live here.
Unique among the United States, Alaska is not entirely subdivided into organized county equivalents. In 1970, the United States Census Bureau divided the unorganized borough into 11 census areas to facilitate census taking in the large unorganized area.

List of counties in Delaware

The state of Delaware has three counties: New Castle, Kent, and Sussex, the fewest counties of any U.S. state. The origin of the county boundaries goes back to former court districts. The powers of the counties' legislative bodies are limited to issues such as zoning and development.
Each county elects a legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as the "County Council", and in Kent County as the "Levy Court"). The counties are able to raise taxes and borrow money. They also have control over garbage disposal, water supply, sewerage, zoning, development, and building codes.
Most functions which are handled on a county-by-county basis in other statesâsuch as court and law enforcementâhave been centralized in Delaware, leading to a significant amount of power in the Delaware state government.

'Round Springfield

"'Round Springfield" is the 125th episode (the 22nd episode of season 6) of "The Simpsons". It was first shown on television on 30 April 1995. The episode was written by Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia based on a story idea by Al Jean and Mike Reiss and the first episode directed by Steven Dean Moore. The episode features many cultural references, including Carole King's song "Jazzman", the actor James Earl Jones and the "Kimba the White Lion/The Lion King" controversy.
Bart Simpson gets a stomachache after accidentally eating a jagged metal Krusty-O with his breakfast cereal. Lisa is the only one who believes him, however. Homer and Marge send him to school anyway. Bart struggles through the test. After finally convincing Mrs. Krabappel that he is actually ill, she lets him go and see the nurse. Bart collapses on the medical room floor. He is then taken to Springfield General Hospital where he undergoes surgery from Dr. Hibbert and Dr. Nick. It seems Bart has appendicitis. 
While visiting Bart in the hospital, Lisa meets her hero, jazzman Bleeding Gums Murphy, in a bed in another ward. Later, Bleeding Gums gives Lisa his saxophone for her school recital. It starts off terribly (owing to most of the orchestra having their appendixes removed so they could miss school), but Lisa gets up and performs a solo routine, becoming the star of the show. Returning to the hospital the next day, Lisa becomes sad to learn that Bleeding Gums has died. Lisa is the only person who attends Bleeding Gums's funeral, and she vows to make sure that everyone in Springfield knows the name Bleeding Gums Murphy. Bart, meanwhile, sues Krusty the Clown and is given a $100,000 settlement. However, after Bart's attorney Lionel Hutz takes his "legal fees", Bart is left with only $500, though Bart seems to be okay with it.
Lisa is still sad. She decides that the best way to honor Bleeding Gums' memory is by having his album played at the local jazz station. Lisa spots it in the Android's Dungeon store for $250, but after hearing that Bleeding Gums is dead, Comic Book Guy doubles the price to $500. Bart then walks in with his $500 and, after remembering that Lisa was the only one who believed him about his stomach ache, Bart decides to buy the album with his money, and Lisa thanks him for it. When the station plays one of Bleeding Gums's songs, Lisa is disappointed because the station's tiny range still prevents anyone from hearing it. Lightning then strikes the antenna, giving it extra power and projecting it into every radio in Springfield. Lisa is finally satisfied. After proclaiming "that was for you Bleeding Gums," she turns to leave, but not before Bleeding Gums is seen from heaven to tell Lisa that she had made "an old jazz man happy". After saying a final goodbye, Lisa and Bleeding Gums jam to "Jazzman" one last time.
The title of this episode is a play on both the song 'Round Midnight by Thelonious Monk and the movie of the same also about an unhappy jazz musician. 
Bleeding Gums Murphy appears to Lisa in a cloud near the end of the episode with Darth Vader, Mufasa, and James Earl Jones saying "This is CNN". Despite the fact that all three characters were voiced by Jones, the characters in this scene were impersonated by cast member Harry Shearer; Jones himself guest starred in two episodes before. Additionally, Mufasa accidentally saids "Kimba". He corrects himself by saying "Simba". This is a reference to controversy regarding "The Lion King"'s similarity to the anime show "Kimba the White Lion". Lisa and Bleeding Gums play Carole King's song "Jazzman" in this scene and in the hospital earlier in the episode. Bleeding Gums has to leave at the end of the scene because he has a date with the jazz singer Billie Holiday. for the TV Show "ER". 
Bleeding Gums appears on an episode of "The Cosby Show". This is a reference to Cosby often getting jazz musicians he liked to appear on the show; in the episode, Cosby is voiced by "The Simpsons" regular Dan Castellaneta. Lionel Hutz' "crack team of lawyers" Robert Shaporo and Albert Dershman are parodies of Robert Shapiro and Alan Dershowitz, two of the defense attorneys at the O.J. Simpson murder case. The three drive away in a white Ford Bronco, the same car O.J. Simpson drove in his televised low-speed pursuit before his arrest.
This was the first episode directed by Steven Dean Moore. Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia, who were writers on "The Critic" and were big fans of "The Simpsons", were happy to be able to write an episode. The original story was based on a story idea by Al Jean and Mike Reiss. The main story of the episode's first act sees Bart get appendicitis from eating a jagged metal Krusty-O. Mike Reiss's father, being a doctor, "sort of" acted as the medical consultant on this episode. He stated that "you can't get" appendicitis from eating a piece of metal, but the writers decided to do it anyway. In his flashback, Murphy is shown as having a "$1,500 a day FabergÃ© egg habit"; Jean "didn't realize just how expensive" FabergÃ© eggs actually were, so the joke does not make much sense.
This episode was the first to have a recurring character killed off on the show. The writers and production team felt that it would be a good, emotional storyline, which, through Lisa, could focus on the theme of sadness. They decided that it could not be one of the main characters; Jean joked that "we wouldn't want it to be someone like Mr. Burns, that we'd obviously want to see in the show again". But later Jean decided on Bleeding Gums Murphy, a character introduced in "Moaning Lisa", an episode of season 1; a flashback to "Moaning Lisa" is featured in the episode. 
Murphy was a fairly minor character, only appearing in 2 episodes of the show, but he appeared in the show's opening sequence and remained there after this episode, until the opening was re-designed in season 20. Moore's first ever job on the show was in the animation department for "Moaning Lisa" so he "appreciated" being able to direct this episode. Reiss stated "I had been polling for years to kill Marge's mom but this was a better idea". Actor Ron Taylor returned to guest star as Murphy in the episode. Comedian Steve Allen also made his second guest appearance on the show, who had also appeared in the episode "Separate Vocations" before.
"'Round Springfield" finished 60th on its American broadcast in the ratings for the week of April 24 to April 30, 1995. It received a Nielsen rating of 8.2. The episode was the fourth highest rated show on the Fox network that week. Mike Reiss and Al Jean thought that the episode would "get a ton of awards", and joked that this was why they opted to receive a story credit, which they usually would not. Ultimately it did not win any awards. 
Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, who were the authors of the book "I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide" found that it was "a real tear-jerker" and praised Grampa believing everything he saw was death. Ryan Keefer of DVD Verdict rated the episode a "B". Adam Finley of "TV Squad" liked the episode. He liked its many "great moments" including "Steve Allen pimping his books on TV: "How to Make Love to Steve Allen"; "Happiness is a Naked Steve Allen"; "Journey to the Center of Steve Allen"; "The Joy of Cooking Steve Allen"" and "Moe running a "retox" clinic right next to a detox clinic". 
On the bad review side, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide called the episode "dull" stating that "some of the moments connected to Bart's illness are funny," but that he "really hate[s] that "Jazzman" song" and dislikes "the Bleeding Gums parts."
In the episode, budget cuts at Springfield Elementary School force the janitor Groundskeeper Willie to be used as a French teacher. Expressing his disdain for French people, he exclaims to his class: "Bonjour, you cheese-eatin' surrender monkeys." This quote, particularly the phrase "cheese-eating surrender monkeys", has since been more widely used. It was used particularly in the run-up to the war in Iraq, having been popularized by the right-wing "National Review" journalist Jonah Goldberg, to describe European and especially French opposition to military action. It was once noted that the phrase was "made acceptable in official diplomatic channels around the globe". Ben Macintyre has written that the phrase is "perhaps the most famous" of the show's coinages and since Goldberg's usage it "has gone on to become a journalistic clichÃ©." 
It has subsequently been used by the "New York Post" (as "Surrender Monkeys") as the headline for its December 7, 2006, front page, referring to the Iraq Study Group and its recommendation that U.S. soldiers be withdrawn from Iraq by early 2008. Articles in the "Daily Mail" have used the phrase in reference the French's "attitude problem", and the "muted" European reaction to the death of Osama Bin Laden, while "The Daily Telegraph" has cited it in relation to Anglo-French military cooperation. The term has been used in books by commentator Laura Ingraham, and academics Stuart Croft, Stephen Chan, and Paul L. Moorcraft and Philip M. Taylor. Ned Sherrin included the quote in the "Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations"; it was introduced in the third edition in 2005. It is also included in the "Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations". Douglas Coupland's 2009 novel "Generation A" refers to Groundskeeper Willie's use of the phrase.
The line was "probably" written by Ken Keeler during one of the episode's re-write sessions, although none of those present on the episode's DVD audio commentary could remember for sure. The writers were surprised it became as widely used as it did and never meant it as a political statement, merely as an "obnoxious" joke for Willie. The French dub of the show uses the line "singes mangeurs de fromage", eliding the word "surrender".

List of counties in Hawaii

There are five counties of Hawaii on the Hawaiian Islands in the United States. Counties are the only lower governments in the State of Hawaii. This is unusual in the United States. Most states include city governments, township governments, or other local authorities. The Hawaii State Department of Education is in charge of Hawaii's public education, because there are no local school boards to operate schools. People in Hawaii pay property taxes and user fees to the county they live in to help pay for road maintenance, community activities, parks, garbage disposal, police, ambulances, and fire departments. All the counties in Hawaii were formed in 1905 from unorganized territory, seven years after the Territory of Hawaii was created. The county of Kalawao is very small because it used to be a leper colony, so it does not as have many elected officials as the other counties do.
The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code below is a code which is used by the United States government to keep track of all the counties. It can be used to find more information on that county. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county. The county seat is the city, town or village where the county government is actually located.

List of counties in Vermont

There are 14 counties in the U.S. state of Vermont. These counties together contain 255 political units, or places, including 237 towns, 9 cities, 5 unincorporated areas, and 4 gores. Each county has a county seat, known in Vermont as "shire town". In 1779, Vermont had two counties. The western side of the state was called Bennington County and the eastern was called Cumberland County. In 1781, Cumberland County was made into three counties in Vermont plus another county named Washington (not the same as the modern Washington County) that then became part of New Hampshire. Today's Washington County was known as Jefferson County from its start in 1810 until it was renamed in 1814.

Wounded Knee Massacre

The Wounded Knee Massacre was a brief fight between the Native American Lakota people and the US Army. It took place at Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota on December 29, 1890. About 300 Lakota and 25 soldiers were killed. The Lakota were part of the Sioux nation. The army had been sent into the area to take the guns owned by the Lakota.
During the 1890's, a Native American shaman, named Wovoka, began teaching people about his visions for the future. He said the living would join with the dead, and the prairies would be covered in new soil. This would bury the European settlers, and life would return to the way it had been with lots of bison and other animals to hunt. To make this happen, he told people they would have to perform the Ghost Dance. The dancers wore brightly colored shirts with pictures of bison and eagles. They believed the shirts had magic powers which would protect them from bullets. The Ghost Dance caused a lot of excitement in the Sioux camps. European settlers were worried by these beliefs and the sight of wild and crazy people dancing in the snow. They demanded protection from the army.
The army was sent in to the Native American camps to arrest the leaders and take away their weapons until things settled down. Chief Sitting Bull was killed when the army tried to arrest him at Standing Rock Reservation of December 15, 1890. The army then went to arrest Chief Big Foot. On December 28, the army found Chief Big Foot, who was leading his people south to the Pine Ridge Reservation, near the Wounded Knee Creek. The next morning Chief Big Foot met with Colonel Forsyth.
During the meeting a shot was fired, and very quickly both groups began shooting at each other. The army had Hotchkiss cannons which fired into the tepees. Many women and children were caught in the gunfire. When the shooting stopped over 300 people had been killed.

Normativity

Normativity is a concept. Being normative is not about how 'normal' you are, not even in terms of 'normal' as defined by mainstream society. That is because it is not about a description of a person. Being normative is about presenting mainstream/dominant ideas about what is normal, acceptable and desirable as being true for everyone, not just for the dominant group in question.

Bean queen

Bean queen (sometimes rice and bean queen) is a gay slang term. The term refers to a white gay man who is chiefly attracted to Hispanic and Latino men.
One source describes these white gay males as "Gay men who are attracted to gentlemen of the Latino flava." "Bean queen" is probably derived from "rice queen". This term refers to a gay white male who is attracted to Asian men. In this case, the word rice (the food that forms the basis of the Asian diet) has been substituted with the word bean or rice and bean, foods popular throughout Central America, South America and the Caribbean. Other food-based variations include "taco queen" and "salsa queen". "Refried beans" refers to Hispanic and Latino men who prefer other Hispanic and Latino men. Much less frequently, these terms are used to describe gay Latino men themselves. The term is also used in a derogatory manner when referring to a drag queen of Hispanic or Latino background.

JosÃ© Sarria (December 22, 1922 â August 19, 2013) was an American political activist. For many years, he performed in drag at the Black Cat Bar in San Francisco, California. He ran for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1961, making him the first openly gay candidate for public office in the United States. A portion of a San Francisco street was named in his honor.
Sarria was born in San Francisco to Julio Sarria and Maria Dolores Maldonado on December 22, 1922. His parents did not marry. His father showed no interest in raising him. JosÃ©'s mother tried to raise him on her own. This became too difficult. She placed him with another couple. Both they and his mother indulged his early interest in wearing girls' clothing. Sarria had a talent for languages. This led to his first serious romance with another man. Sarria tutored Paul Kolish. Kolish was an Austrian baron who had fled from the Nazis. Sarria and Kolish fell in love. Their relationship lasted until Kolish and his son were killed in a car accident in 1947.
Sarria served in the United States Army during World War II. He studied to become a teacher after his discharge. He often went to the Black Cat Bar. He met waiter Jimmy Moore. Sarria describes Moore as "the love of [his] life". Sarria was hired as a cocktail waiter. He was convicted on a morals charge. He knew he could not become a certified teacher following his conviction. He began performing as a drag queen. He appeared regularly at the Black Cat. Sarria co-founded several organizations dedicated to gay interests. Sarria became the first openly gay candidate for public office in the United States. He ran for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1961. In 1964 Sarria declared himself "Empress JosÃ© I, The Widow Norton". He founded the Imperial Court System. The System grew to become an international association of charitable organizations.
The Black Cat closed in 1964. Sarria went to work with restaurant operator Pierre Parker. The two operated French restaurants at World's Fairs. Sarria was working at the 1964 New York World's Fair when he learned that Jimmy Moore had died. Sarria worked at several more Fairs before retiring in 1974. Sarria lived with Parker in Phoenix, Arizona for several years, then returned to San Francisco. He continued to reign over the Courts for 43 years. He abdicated in 2007. The city of San Francisco renamed a section of 16th Street in Sarria's honor for his lifetime of activism. 
Sarria died on August 19, 2013 from natural causes in his home in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He was 90 years old.

Crown group

A crown group is a group of living species and their ancestors back to the most recent common ancestor. It is a term in cladistics and phylogenetics. It is a clade with at least some members that have survived to the present day. How a crown group is defined depends on which living species are chosen. One definition stresses the need for members of the crown group to have the clade's characteristic synapomorphy.
The idea was developed by Willi Hennig, the founder of phylogenetic systematics, but he did not use this term. The terms "crown group" and "stem group" were invented by R.P.S. Jefferies in 1979. Though invented in the 1970s, the term was not often used until it was reintroduced in the 2000s.
One very simplified cladogram for birds is shown below:
"Archaeopteryx" and some other extinct groups are not included in the crown group Neornithes. They fall outside the clade, as they diverged earlier. Neoaves can also be considered a crown group, as can Paleognathae, the ratites clade, and Galloanserae, the ducks and chickens clade. Bigger crown groups can also be defined, such as the phylum Chordata.
The stem group of birds would be all the earlier Aves minus the crown group Neornithes.

Vampire Lesbians of Sodom

Vampire Lesbians of Sodom is a satirical play by Charles Busch. It is about two immortal vampire lesbians. They are locked in eternal antagonism after surviving the downfall of the Biblical city of Sodom. Both women arrive in Jazz Age Broadway and Hollywood. They pretend to be silent movie stars. They reach a truce in a final scene set in Las Vegas in the 1980s. "The New York Times" described the show as having "costumes flashier than pinball machines, outrageous lines, awful puns, sinister innocence, [and] harmless depravity". It was first performed at the Limbo Lounge in Manhattan's East Village in 1984. It moved Off Broadway in June 1985 to the Provincetown Playhouse. It had a five year run.

There are three main types of municipalities in Japan: 
There is a fourth type of municipality â the 23 special wards of Tokyo. 
In 1878, the national government enacted the "Municipalities Formation Law", the "Prefectural Assemblies Act", and the "Local Tax Ordinance". Japan was organized into three levels of government: 
In 1889, the ""shikuchÅson" was refined to create 39 cities and 15,820 towns and villages. The "Municipal Government Act" was a blend of Japanese customs and Prussiaâs local government system. 
After 1898, local officials were elected in municipal elections.
Since the 19th century, Japan has been divided into 47 prefectures; and each prefecture has many districts and municipalities.
In 1947, the "Local Autonomy Law" (LAL) further refined Japan's municipalities.

Sodom and Gomorrah

Sodom and Gomorrah are two ancient cities mentioned in the "Book of Genesis". Both cities were destroyed by fire from God because of their sexual wickednesses including rape, child sexual abuse, indecent assault. Some scholars believe that the cities were in Moab, east of the southern edge of the Dead Sea. The word "sodomy" (anal sex) is derived from Sodom. The story of Sodom and Gomorrah was made into a movie in 1963. 
God tells Abraham He plans to destroy Sodom because of its wickedness. Abraham gets God to promise to spare it if ten good men can be found.
Lot, Abraham's relative, lives in Sodom. He is visited by three men who are angels. An interpretation by some scholars is that the men of Sodom want to have anal sex with these visitors. Lot refuses to allow this. He offers the Sodomites his two virgin daughters instead. The men decline the offer. They storm Lot's door. The angels rescue Lot. They tell Lot that God has sent them to destroy Sodom for its wickness. They order Lot to gather his family, and leave the city. They forbid Lot or any of his family to look upon the city during its destruction. Lot and his family flee. Lot's wife looks back at the city. She is turned into a pillar of salt.

Windsor Railway Bridge

Windsor Railway Bridge is a wrought iron 'tied arch' bridge in Windsor, Berkshire. It was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and carried Brunel's Great Western Railway (GWR) branch line from Slough to Windsor (Windsor and Eton Central station). It crosses the River Thames between Romney Lock and Boveney Lock.
The bridge is a single-span structure with three bowstring trusses which created two bays for the original two GWR tracks. The bridge is the world's oldest wrought iron bridge still in regular service. It is a forerunner for Brunel's last masterpiece, the Royal Albert Bridge, Saltash. The bridge was Grade II* listed in 1975.
The line opened in 1849. The construction of the line was delayed and could not be included in the original Parliamentary Act because of objections from the Provost of Eton College.
The brick viaduct was constructed between 1861â65 to replace the original wooden trestle viaduct.
Although the bridge was built to take two tracks, the track on the upstream side was removed when the line was rationalised in the 1960s. The trackbed on this side now carries a sewage or water main pipe.

Saint Sebastian

Saint Sebastian (died c. 268) was a Christian saint and martyr. He is said to have been killed during the Roman emperor Diocletian's persecution of Christians. He is usually depicted in art and literature tied to a post or tree and shot with arrows. This is the most common artistic depiction of Sebastian. However, he was rescued and healed by Irene of Rome. He then criticised the emperor. He was clubbed to death. He is venerated in both the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox churches.
Saint Sebastian is possibly the earliest gay icon. His strong and shirtless physique, symbolic arrow-pierced flesh, and rapturous look of pain combined have intrigued both gay and straight artists for centuries. This interest launched the first explicitly gay cult in the 19th century. Journalist Richard A. Kaye wrote, "contemporary gay men have seen in Sebastian at once a stunning advertisement for homosexual desire (indeed, a homoerotic ideal), and a prototypical portrait of tortured closet case." Because Saint Sebastian is a gay icon, Tennessee Williams chose to use that name for the martyred character Sebastian in his play, "Suddenly, Last Summer". The name was also used by Irish writer and poet Oscar Wilde (as Sebastian Melmoth) when in exile after his release from prison. Wilde was about as "out of the closet" as was possible for the late 19th century. He is himself considered a gay icon.

Aurelius and Natalia (died 852) were Christian martyrs who were put to death during the reign of Abd ar-Rahman II, Emir of CÃ³rdoba. They are counted among the Martyrs of CÃ³rdoba. Aurelius and his wife Natalia were both the offspring of Muslim fathers. They were secretly Christians. Aurelius's cousin Felix and his wife Liliosa were also Christians. Under Sharia Law, all four of them were required to profess Islam. In time though all four began to openly profess the Christian faith. The two women would go about in public with their faces unveiled. They were all swiftly arrested as apostates from Islam. They were given four days to recant. They refused, and were beheaded. They were martyred with a local monk, George. He had openly spoken out against the prophet Mohammed. He had been offered a pardon as a foreigner.

Charlotte Corday

Charlotte Corday (Marie-Anne Charlotte de Corday d'Armont, 27 July 1768 â 17 July 1793), was a figure of the French Revolution. In 1793, she was sent to the guillotine for the assassination of Jacobin leader Jean-Paul Marat. She blamed Marat for the more extreme course the Revolution had taken. He played a large role in the takedown of the Girondins. Corday believed in the Girondins' cause. In 1847, writer Alphonse de Lamartine gave Corday the nickname " (the Angel of Assassination).
Charlotte Corday was born in Saint-Saturnin-des-Ligneries, Orne in Normandy, France in 1768. Corday was from a family of minor aristocrats.
When Corday was a girl, her older sister and their mother, Charlotte Marie Jacqueline Gaultier de Mesnival died. Her father sent Corday and her younger sister to a convent in Caen. In the convent's library, Corday read the writing of Plutarch, Rousseau, and Voltaire After 1791, Corday lived in Caen with her cousin, Madame Le Coustellier de Bretteville-Gouville. They were very close. Corday was going to inherit her cousin's estate.
As the French Revolution became more and more extreme, Corday began to support the Girondin even more. She loved their speeches and liked many of the Girondins she met in Caen very much. She decided that she needed to do what the Girondins were doing. She thought that they were the party that would save France from the radicalism of the Jacobins. The Jacobins believed that France would be saved only by terrifying the people into obedience. They believed that violence was the only way. Corday and the Girondins did not agree with this approach. Corday decided to kill Marat, because she believed he was the most radical. She believed this because she blamed him for the September Massacres.
Jean-Paul Marat was a member of the radical Jacobin party that led the Reign of Terror. He wrote an important and widely read newspaper called " (the Friend of the People). Corday also blamed Marat for the civil war she thought would happen in France. She believed that Marat was bad for the future of France and that his death would stop the violence in France. She also believed that Louis XVI should not have been executed.
On July 9th, 1793, Corday left her cousin's estate and went to Paris, where she bought a knife. At her hotel, she wrote a letter to the French people. In the letter, she explained why she had killed Marat. She called it "" ("Address to the French people, friends of law and peace").
At first, she planned to assassinate Marat in front of the entire National Convention. However, Marat did not attend meetings anymore, because of a skin disease. She changed her plan and went to his home. The first time she came, Marat's wife, Simonne Evrard, did not let her come in. When she came back in the evening, Marat let her in. She gave him the names of Girondins in Caen, and he wrote them down. Then, she stabbed him with the knife she had bought. Marat called "" ("help me, my dear friend!") to his wife and died.
David, one of Marat's friends painted Marat's body. The painting became famous.
The moment was also painted by Baudry.
Corday said that she had planned to kill Marat alone. There was no evidence against this. Corday said that she "killed one man to save a hundred thousand" at her trial. 
Four days after she killed Marat, Corday was execution via guillotine. 
Corday's plan worked, but it also failed. The violence in France did not stop. Marat became a martyr.

Batman Bridge

The Batman Bridge crosses the Tamar River in northern Tasmania, about 30Â km north of Launceston. It was opened on 18 May 1968 by the Premier of Tasmania, Eric Reece. When it was built it was one of the first cable-stayed truss bridges in the world. It provides access between the north east and north west of Tasmania. It was named after John Batman, a Tasmanian pioneer and the founder of the city of Melbourne. 
The bridge is held up by cables connected to a high A frame tower on the west bank. This tower is not straight, but leans out over the river. The bridge is in length. The main span over the river is and with a span on the western shore of . The eastern side is approached by four continuous viaduct spans. The bridge is above the high water level. The steel deck has room for two lanes of traffic and a walk way for people on both sides.
The bridge is built at the narrowest point on the Tamar River, at Whirlpool Reach. However, the east bank was found to be soft clay which would not support the bridge. The A frame tower on the west bank is built into the bedrock below the surface and supported by steel cables concreted into tunnels in the bedrock. The tower supports the whole weight of the river span of the bridge.

Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)

The 1940 Tacoma Narrows Bridge was the first version of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. It was a suspension bridge in the U.S. state of Washington. The bridge was built over the Tacoma Narrows strait of Puget Sound between Tacoma and the Kitsap Peninsula. It opened on July 1, 1940. The bridge collapsed into Puget Sound on November 7 of the same year. At that time, it was the third longest suspension bridge in the world in terms of main span length. The Golden Gate Bridge and the George Washington Bridge were the only bridges that were larger.
Construction of the bridge started in September 1938. After the deck was built, the wind caused it to move vertically. Because of this, the people building it gave it the nickname Galloping Gertie. The movement was seen even when the bridge opened to the public. Many things were tried to stop the bridge from moving. None of these things worked. The bridge's main span collapsed under winds on the morning of November 7, 1940.
Because of World War II, the bridge could not be built again at that time. The towers and cables of the bridge were still in place. These and the rest of the bridge were taken apart and sold as scrap metal. In 1950, a new Tacoma Narrows Bridge opened in the same place. It used the first bridge's tower pedestals and cable anchorages. The parts of the bridge that fell into the water are now an artificial reef.
The bridge's collapse had lasting effects on science and engineering. In many physics books, it is used to show resonance. Its collapse also helped increase research in the field of bridge aerodynamics-aeroelastics. This has affected the designs of all the world's large long-span bridges built since 1940.
People wanted a bridge built between Tacoma and the Kitsap Peninsula since the late 1800s. In 1889, the Northern Pacific Railway wanted to build a trestle there. The Tacoma Chamber of Commerce began working toward getting the money to build a bridge in 1923. Many well known bridge engineers were talked to about the bridge. These included Joseph B. Strauss and David B. Steinman. Later in time, Strauss was the main engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge and he designed the Mackinac Bridge. Steinman went to the area many times. He created a plan for the bridge in 1929. By 1931, the Chamber chose not to follow his plan because they thought Steinman was not doing enough to help get money to pay for the bridge. Another problem with paying for the bridge was buying out the ferry contract from a company that was running service on the Narrows at the time.
The Washington State legislature created the Washington State Toll Bridge Authority and gave $5,000 to study the request by Tacoma and Pierce County for a bridge.
From the start, getting money to pay for the bridge was a problem. Money earned from tolls on the bridge would not be enough to pay for the bridge's construction. There was support for the bridge from the U.S. Navy and Army. The Navy had a shipyard in Bremerton. The Army had McChord Field and Fort Lewis near Tacoma. The bridge would be useful to both the Army and Navy.
Clark Eldridge, an engineer working for the state, created a suspension bridge design. This design was similar to the design of many other suspension bridges. It was a design that had be shown to work very well at other places. The Washington Toll Bridge Authority asked for $11 million from the Federal Public Works Administration (PWA). Early construction plans by the Washington Department of Highways had a set of 25-foot-deep (7.6m) girders to sit beneath the roadway. These would make the roadway more stiff so it would not move easily.
Leon Moisseiff had other ideas about building the bridge. Moisseiff was a well known New York bridge engineer. He was the designer and consultant engineer for the Golden Gate Bridge. Moisseiff talked to the PWA and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) about building the bridge for less money. He suggested that they use shallower supportsâgirders that were only deep. His ideas meant the bridge would be slimmer but they reduced the construction costs. Moisseiff's design was chosen. The other design was said to cost too much. On June 23, 1938, the PWA approved nearly $6 million for the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Tolls from the bridge would earn another $1.6 million pay for the estimated total $8 million cost.
Using Moisseiff's design, bridge construction began on September 27, 1938. Construction took only nineteen months. It cost $6.4 million. The Tacoma Narrows Bridge, with a main span of , was the third-longest suspension bridge in the world at that time. The two larger bridges were the George Washington Bridge between New Jersey and New York City, and the Golden Gate Bridge, just north of San Francisco.
Because the bridge was not expected to have large amounts of traffic, the bridge was designed with only two lanes. It was just wide. This was quite narrow given how long it was. With only the -deep girders to give it extra depth, the bridge's roadway was very shallow.
The shallow and narrow girders are what caused the bridge to collapse. With such small girders, the deck of the bridge was not rigid enough. It was easily moved by the winds. The bridge was well known for its movement. A small wind could make the center span move several feet during four- to five-second intervals. This was seen by the builders and workmen during construction. It caused some of the workers to name the bridge "Galloping Gertie." Even the public felt these motions on the day that the bridge opened on July 1, 1940.
Another reason the bridge swayed and then fell was its solid sides. This did not allow wind to pass through the bridge's deck. This design allowed the bridge to catch the wind and sway, which ultimately took it down.
Because the bridge moved so much while it was being built, many ideas were used to make it move less. They included
The Washington Toll Bridge Authority hired Professor Frederick Burt Farquharson to make tests of the bridge in a wind-tunnel. He was an engineering professor at the University of Washington. Professor Farquharson and his students built a 1:200-scale model of the bridge and a 1:20-scale model of a section of the deck. The first studies ended on November 2, 1940. This was five days before the bridge collapse on November 7. He found two ways to fix the problem:
The first option was not not liked because of if the changes were done, they could not be undone. The second option was the chosen one. It was not done because the bridge collapsed five days later.
The collapse happened on November 7, 1940, at 11:00 a.m. (Pacific time). It was caused by physical phenomenon known as aeroelastic flutter.
Leonard Coatsworth, a "Tacoma News Tribune" editor was the last person to drive on the bridge. He was driving with his dog, Tubby, over the bridge when the bridge started to vibrate very badly. Coatsworth had to leave his car:
No one died in the collapse of the bridge. Tubby, a black male cocker spaniel, was the only death of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge disaster. The dog was lost along with Coatsworth's car. Professor Farquharson and a news photographer tried to save Tubby, but the dog was too scared to leave the car. He bit one of the people trying to save him. Tubby died when the bridge fell. Neither his body nor the car were ever recovered. Coatsworth had been driving Tubby back to his daughter. She was the owner of the dog. Coatsworth was payed US $450 for his car and $364.40 for what was in the car. This included Tubby.
Theodore von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n was one of the people who tried to learn what caused the collapse. He was the director of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory and a well known aerodynamicist. He said that the State of Washington could not get money from one of the insurance policies for the bridge. This was because its insurance agent had fraudulently taken the insurance pyments. The agent, Hallett R. French worked for the Merchant's Fire Assurance Company. He was charged with grand larceny for keeping the payments for $800,000 worth of insurance. The bridge was insured by many other policies. These covered 80% of the $5.2 million bridge's value. Most of these were payed without problems.
On November 28, 1940, the U.S. Navy's Hydrographic Office said that the parts of the bridge were at geographical coordinates , at a depth of 180 feet (55 meters).
The collapse of the bridge was recorded on movie by Barney Elliott. He was the owner of a local camera store. The movie shows Leonard Coatsworth leaving the bridge after exiting his car. In 1998, "The Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse" was chosen for preservation in the United States National movie Registry by the Library of Congress. It was chosen because it was culturally, historically, or aesthetically important. This footage is still shown to engineering, architecture, and physics students as an example of what can go wrong. Elliot's movies of the construction and collapse of the bridge were shot on 16Â mm Kodachrome movie. Most copies are in black and white. This is because newsreels of the day copied the movie onto 35Â mm black-and-white stock.
A commission formed by the Federal Works Agency studied the collapse of the bridge. It included Othmar Ammann and Theodore von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n. They looked at three possible reasons for the collapse:
Efforts to save the bridge started after its collapse. They continued into May 1943. It was decided that the bridge could not be repaired. The entire bridge would have to be taken down. A new bridge would have to be built. At the time, the United States was dealing with World War II. This meant the steel that would be needed to built the bridge was needed for the war. Steel from the old bridge cables and the suspension span was sold melted down. It cost the state more to destroy the bridge than it earned by selling the materials. The state lost over $350,000.
The cable anchorages, tower pedestals and most of the substructure were not damaged badly in the collapse. They were used again during construction of the new bridge that opened in 1950. The towers were badly damaged. They were taken down. The steel in them was sold to be melted down.
The parts of the bridge that fell into the water below are now a large artificial reef. They are listed on the National Register of Historic Places with reference number 92001068.
Othmar Ammann is a leading bridge designer. He is also a member of the Federal Works Agency Commission that looked at the causes of the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. He wrote:
The Bronx Whitestone Bridge has a design that is much like the 1940 Tacoma Narrows Bridge. It was reinforced after the collapse. Fourteen-foot-high (4.3 m) steel trusses were added on both sides of the deck in 1943. These add weight to the bridge and make it more stiff. This was done to reduce oscillation. In 2003, the trusses were removed. Aerodynamic fiberglass fairings were added along both sides of the road deck.
Because of materials and labor shortages caused by World War II, it took 10 years before a new bridge was opened. This bridge was opened to traffic on October 14, 1950. It is long â longer than Galloping Gertie. The new bridge also has more lanes than the original bridge.
Half a century later, the new bridge had more traffic than it could handle. A second, parallel suspension bridge was built to carry eastbound traffic. The suspension bridge that was completed in 1950 was changed to only carry westbound traffic. The new parallel bridge opened to traffic in July 2007.

West Gate Bridge

The Westgate Bridge crosses the Yarra River, near Melbourne, Victoria. It is the third longest bridge in Australia. The bridge's length, including the approaches is . Work began on the bridge on 22 April 1968, and the bridge was opened on 15 November 1978 at a cost of AU$202 million. It was the scene of Australia's worst industrial accident when part of the bridge collapsed in October 1970, killing 35 men and injuring 18 others.
The bridge is a box girder and cable stayed bridge. The bridge deck is above the water level to allow ships to pass underneath. The supporting pylons are high, and help support a span of . The bridge is wide and carries eight lanes of traffic. About 160,000 vehicles travel over the bridge each day.
Problems were first noticed on the West Gate Bridge in May 1970 when several steel girders did not fit into position by about . Engineers proposed putting ten concrete blocks, each weighing about 8 tons, onto the girders to bend them into the correct position. In September 1970 is was noticed that this had caused part of the girder to buckle. On 15 October the engineers began removing the bolts holding the buckled girders in place. This would allow the steel to unbuckle and new steel could be put up to support the damaged section. At 11.50am the damaged section collapsed. Workers both on and under the bridge were killed when the 2,000 ton section fell to the ground. The final death toll was 35 men killed and 18 injured.

The Blair Witch Project

The Blair Witch Project is a 1999 American independent supernatural horror movie. It was written and directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo SÃ¡nchez and produced by the Haxan Films production company. 
This movie was put together from amateur footage and relates the story of three student filmmakers (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael C. Williams) who disappeared while hiking in the Black Hills near Burkittsville, Maryland in 1994 to film a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch. The viewers are told the three were never seen or heard from again, although their video and sound equipment (along with most of the footage they shot) was discovered a year later. This "recovered footage" is presented as the viewer is watching the movie.
"The Blair Witch Project" was first shown at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival. It was released by Artisan on 30 July 1999 after months of publicity, including a ground-breaking campaign by the studio to use the Internet and suggest that the film was a record of real events. The distribution strategy for "The Blair Witch Project" was created and implemented by Artisan studio executive Steven Rothenberg. The movie was positively received by critics and went on to gross over US$248 million worldwide, making it one of the most successful independent movies of all time. The DVD was released in December 1999 and presented only in fullscreen.
In October 1994, movie students Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard set out to make a documentary about the fabled Blair Witch. They travel to Burkittsville, Maryland, which the town was used to be called Blair. They interview people living in the local area about the legend of the Blair Witch. The local people tell them of Rustin Parr, a hermit who kidnapped seven children in the 1940s and brought them to his house in the woods, where he tortured and killed them. Parr brought the children into his home's basement in pairs, forcing the first child to face the corner and listen to their companion's screams as he murdered the second child. Parr would then murder the first child. Eventually turning himself in to the police, Parr later pleaded insanity, saying that the spirit of Elly Kedward, a witch hanged in the 18th century, had been terrorizing him for some time and promised to leave him alone if he murdered the kids. The three students also interviews Mary Brown, a local eccentric who tells them that she had encountered the Blair Witch as a child. 
The second day, the students begin to explore the woods in north Burkittsville to look for evidence of the Blair Witch. Along the way, a fisherman warns them that the woods are haunted, and recalls a time that he had seen strange mist rising from the water. The students hike to Coffin Rock, where five men were found ritualistically murdered in the 19th century, and then camp for the night. The next day they move deeper into the woods, despite being uncertain of their exact location on the map. They eventually locate what appears to be an old cemetery with seven small cairns. They set up camp nearby and then return to the cemetery after dark. They later hear crackling sounds in the darkness that seem to be coming from all directions and assume the noises are from animals or locals following them. 
That same following day they attempt to return to their car, but cannot find their way; they try until it is night time, when they are forced to set camp. That night, they hear crackling noises again, but they cannot see anything. The next morning they find three cairns have been built around their tent during the night. As they continue trying to find their way out of the woods, Heather realizes that her map is missing, and Mike later reveals that he kicked it into a creek out of frustration the previous day. Josh and Heather get angry at Mike. They then realize they are now hopelessly lost, and decide to simply "head south". Soon, they discover a multitude of humanoid stick figures suspended from trees. That night, they hear more strange noises, including the sounds of children and bizarre "morphing" sounds. When an unknown force shakes the tent, they flee in a panic and hide in the woods until it is morning. Upon returning to their tent, they find that their possessions have been rifled through, and Josh's equipment is covered with slime, causing them to question why only his belongings were affected. As the day wears on, they pass a log over a stream that was identical to the one they had passed earlier, despite having traveled directly south all day, and again set camp, completely demoralized at having wasted the entire day seemingly going in circles, with Josh outside on guard duty.
Josh disappears the next morning. After a while of finding him, Mike and Heather eventually break camp and slowly move on. That night, they hear Josh screaming in the darkness, but are not able to find him. The next morning, Heather finds a bundle of sticks and fabric outside their tent. Later inspection reveals it contains blood-soaked scraps of Josh's shirt, as well as teeth and hair, but she does not mention this to Mike. 
That night, Heather records herself apologizing to the co-producers of her project as well as her family, and starts to cry, finally admitting her fate. Later, they again hear Josh crying for help, but this time they follow them and discover an abandoned house in the woods. Hanging on the front of the house is the same human stick figure that they saw in the woods. Mike runs upstairs, following the voice, while Heather tries to follow. Mike then claims he hears Josh in the basement. He follows the sound and, after what seems to be a struggle, goes silent and drops to the floor. Heather runs down to the basement screaming for Mike, but she does not hear Mike. She then enters the basement looking for both men, and her camera catches a glimpse of Mike facing the wall. Heather then screams as she and her camera drop to the floor. There is only silence as the footage ends.
"The Blair Witch Project" was developed by the filmmakers. The script was written in 1988. It began with a 68-page outline, with the dialogue to be improvised. According to the directors of the movie, they advertised in "Back Stage" magazine for actors with strong improvisational abilities. There was a very informal improvisational audition process to narrow the total amount of 2,000 actors. In talks with investors of the movie, they presented an eight-minute documentary along with newspapers and news footage. This documentary, originally called "The Blair Witch Project: The Story of Black Hills Disappearances" was produced by Haxan Films. In the movie, the Blair Witch is, according to legend, the ghost of Elly Kedward, a woman banished from the Blair Township (latter-day Burkittsville) for witchcraft in 1785. The directors incorporated that part of the legend, along with allusions to the Salem Witch Trials and "The Crucible", to play on the themes of injustice done on those who were called witches. They were influenced by "The Shining", "Alien" and "The Omen." "Jaws" was an influence as well, presumably because the witch was hidden from the viewer for the entirety of the film, forcing suspense from the unknown.
The movie was shot for only eight days in October 1998. Most of the movie was filmed in the tiny Seneca Creek State Park in Montgomery County, Maryland, although a few scenes were filmed in the real town of Burkittsville. Some of the townspeople interviewed in the film were not actors, and some were planted actors, unknown to the main cast. Donahue had never operated a camera before, and spent two days in a "crash course". Donahue said she modeled her character after a director she once worked with, citing the character's self assuredness when everything went as planned, and confusion during crisis. The three actors filmed the whole movie with only two cameras. They recorded using Heather's video camera and a 16mm camera that can record video in black and white. The apparent use of handheld camera, and the coarse grained picture supports clearly the film's documentary feel. The strange recording method is also based on the actors who did not know the movie's story in detail. The three actors were dragged into the woods, and almost tortured with the cold weather, food shortages and spooky sounds.
During filming, the actors were given clues as to their next location through messages given in milk crates found with Global Positioning Satellite systems. They were given individual instructions that they would use to help improvise the action of the day. Teeth were obtained from a Maryland dentist for use as human remains in the film. Influenced by producer Gregg Hale's memories of his military training, in which "enemy soldiers" would hunt a trainee through wild terrain for three days, the directors moved the characters far during the day, harassing them by night and depriving them of food. 
Almost 19 hours of usable recorded footage had to be edited down to 90 minutes. Editing took more than eight months. Originally it was hoped that the movie would make it on to cable television, and the filmmakers did not anticipate wide release. The initial investment by the three University of Central Florida filmmakers was about US$35,000. Artisan acquired the film for US$1.1 million but spent US$25 million to market it. The actors signed a "small" agreement to receive some of the profits from the film's release.
A list of production budget figures have circulated over the years, appearing as low as $20,000. SÃ¡nchez revealed in an interview that when principal photography first wrapped, approximately $20,000 to $25,000 had been spent. Other figures list a final budget ranging between $500,000 and $750,000.
"The Blair Witch Project" grossed $248,639,099 worldwide, compared to its final budget, which ranged between $20,000 and $750,000. The movie received critically positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes says that out of 133 reviews for the movie, 85% of these reviews were positive. 
Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun Times" gave the movie four out of four stars. He called it "an extraordinarily effective horror film". It was listed on Filmcritic.com as the 50th best movie ending of all time. Critics praised Donahue's apology to the camera near the end of the movie, saying it would cause "nightmares for years to come"; Roger Ebert showed how much different this sequence to Robert Scott's final journal entries as he froze to death in the Antarctic. Donahue said that there was a considerable backlash against her because she was starring in the movie. Her claims led to her having threatening encounters and difficulty obtaining employment.
"The Blair Witch Project" is thought to be the first widely released film marketed primarily on the internet. The film's official website featured fake police reports and 'newsreel-style' interviews. Due to this, audiences and critics initially thought it was an actual documentary about the 'missing' teenagers. These augmented the film's convincing found footage style to spark heated debates across the internet over whether the film was a real-life documentary or a work of fiction.
"The Blair Witch Project" was given a Global Film Critics Award for Best Screenplay and won the Independent Spirit John Cassavetes Award. In 2008, "Entertainment Weekly" named "The Blair Witch Project" one of "the 100 best films from 1983 to 2008", ranking it at #99. In 2006, Chicago Film Critics Association listed it as one of the "Top 100 Scariest Movies", ranking it #12. 
Despite its positive reviews, the movie was nominated for the 1999 Razzie Award for Worst Picture. Heather Donahue won a Razzie Award for Worst Actress. The movie also became controversial for it's shaky footage, especially the final sequence in which the camera operator is running down a set of stairs with the camera. Some viewers had gotten motion sickness and even vomited as a result.
A sequel, "Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2", was released in the autumn of 2000, but was poorly received by most critics. A third installment was announced that same year but did not materialize. On September 2, 2009, it was announced that co-directors Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick were pitching the third film.
"The Blair Witch Project" was released on DVD on October 26, 1999, with VHS and laser disc versions released around the same time. Unlike the widescreen theatrical release, this DVD is presented in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The DVD has a number of special features, including "The Curse of the Blair Witch" and "The Blair Witch Legacy" featurettes, newly discovered footage, director and producer commentary, production notes, cast & crew bios and trailers. A Blu-ray release from Lionsgate was released on October 5, 2010, also in 1.33:1 format.

The Helix Bridge

The Helix Bridge (before called the Double Helix Bridge) is a pedestrian bridge across the opening to Marina Bay in Singapore. It links the new Marina Centre with Marina South. It is located beside the Benjamin Sheares Bridge and the Bayfront Bridge, which are for vehicles (cars, etc.). It was first opened on 24 April 2010, but part of it stayed closed because of nearby construction. The whole bridge was opened on 18 July 2010. It was the last link in the pedestrian walkway that goes all the way around Marina Bay. The bridge is also used as an art gallery where children's paintings and drawings are shown to the public.
The bridge was built as part of a major development plan in the area. Other projects included the huge modern-style Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino, the Singapore Flyer, the Gardens by the Bay, and a business and financial zone. All of it was to be finished by 2012.
The team who designed the bridge included Australian and Singaporean architects. The main design idea is based on the double helix model of DNA. This can be seen best at night, when the bridge is lit up by a series of lights that show the double helix structure. Pairs of coloured letters ("c" and "g", as well as "a" and "t") on the bridge which are lit up in red and green. They represent cytosine, guanine, adenine and thymine, the four bases of DNA.
The bridge has four viewing platforms that give views over the Singapore skyline and events happening within Marina Bay.
The bridge is made of about 650 tonnes of stainless steel and 1000 tonnes of carbon steel. The construction of the bridge was done by two local engineering and construction companies.

Ross Bridge

Ross Bridge is an historic bridge in the town of Ross in central Tasmania, Australia, completed in July 1836. It crosses the Macquarie River. It replaced an earlier bridge built in 1822 made of uncemented stone piers, with a road surface of logs and clay. This bridge was repaired after several piers fell down in 1828, and the bridge finally collapsed in 1831.
The sandstone bridge was built by convicts. It is the third oldest bridge still in use in Australia. The bridge was designed by architect John Lee Archer. Several attempts were made to build a new bridge. Corrupt officials sold materials the government had bought to make the bridge. Archer changed his designs, and a number of different overseers were put in charge. It was not until two convict stonemasons, James Colbeck and Daniel Herbert joined the building team that any progress was made. In 13 months they completed the bridge on which work had started seven years earlier. Herbert is responsible the detailed carvings along both sides of the bridge.

The Richmond Bridge is a historic bridge in Richmond, north of Hobart in Tasmania, Australia. It is the oldest bridge still in use in Australia.
The foundation stone for the Richmond Bridge was laid on 11 December 1823 and the bridge was built by convicts. It was completed in 1825. The bridge was originally named Bigge's Bridge after Royal Commissioner, John Thomas Bigge, who recognised the need for the bridge in 1820.
In 2005, the bridge was recognised as an outstanding historic place and added to the Australian National Heritage List.
In 1832 a guard from the Richmond Gaol was murdered at Richmond bridge. George Grover work including flogging (whipping) the prisoners. He was hated by the convicts. He died after being pushed off the edge of Richmond Bridge while drunk. No one was convicted of his murder.
The Richmond Bridge is made from sandstone dug at Butchers Hill, and carried by convicts using hand carts. It has four main arches, with spans of , , , , and . These arches rise from sloping fins with angular leading edges pointed to the flow of the river.

The Red Bridge in Tasmania crosses the Elizabeth River at Campbell Town. It was built between 1836 and 1838 by convicts using red clay bricks made on site. It has a solid stone base with sandstone piers and cappings. It is the oldest brick arch bridge in Australia, as well as the oldest bridge anywhere on an Australian National Highway. The bridge has three arches with spans of each. It is wide enough for two lanes of traffic as well as pedestrian walkways. It is on the Midland Highway, about halfway between Hobart and Launceston, and carries over two million vehicles per year.
It is said to have been designed by James Blackburn, an architect and a convict who had been sent to Tasmania for the crime of forgery. It was made from 1,250,000 hand-made bricks on dry land. After it was finished the course of the river was changed to flow under the bridge.
The Red Bridge is registered on the Register of the National Estate since 1978.

Cable-stayed bridge

A cable-stayed bridge is a bridge that has one or more columns (called "towers" or "pylons"), with cables supporting the bridge deck.
There are two main types of cable-stayed bridges. In the "harp" design, the cables are nearly parallel. This is done by attaching them to various points on the tower(s). The height of attachment of each cable on the tower is similar to the distance from the tower along the roadway to its lower attachment. In a "fan" design, the cables all connect to or pass over the top of the tower(s).
Compared to other bridge types, the cable-stayed is best for longer spans than used for cantilever bridges, and shorter than those needing a suspension bridge. Cantilever spans become too heavy if they were made longer. A cable-stay bridge is cheaper to build than a suspension bridge over a short distance.
Disadvantages of a Cable Stayed Bridge
-Sways in the wind
-Its support is in water rather than sides
Advantages of a Cable Stayed Bridge
-Good Stiffness
-Large ground anchorages are not required
-It is a modern looking bridge
-Economical for construction
-Well-balanced

Pontoon bridge

A pontoon bridge is a bridge that floats on water. It is a floating bridge with barges or boats ('pontoons') to support the bridge deck. 
Pontoon bridges are usually temporary structures, but some are used for long periods. Permanent floating bridges are useful for sheltered (quiet) water-crossings. It may be too expensive to suspend a bridge from anchored piers. Pontoon bridges may need a section that is elevated, or can be raised or removed, to allow ships to pass.
Pontoon bridges are often used in wartime as river crossings. They are usually temporary, and are sometimes destroyed after crossing (to keep the enemy from using them), or collapsed and carried (if on a long march). They were used to great advantage in many battles. Pontoon bridges have been in use since ancient times. It is thought that the first London Bridge was a Roman pontoon bridge. Roman legions had men and equipment to build pontoon bridges, and often did so.

Cantilever bridge

A cantilever bridge is a bridge built using a cantilever. A cantilever is only supported on one end. For small footbridges, the cantilevers may be simple beams. For large cantilever bridges, designed for road or rail traffic the cantilevers are trusses built from structural steel, or box girders built from prestressed concrete. The steel truss cantilever bridge was a major engineering breakthrough when it was first used, because it can span distances of over . They can be more easily built at difficult crossings as they do not need to be supported during the construction.
Engineers in the nineteenth century knew that a bridge which was built across multiple supports would distribute the loads among them. This meant there would be lower stresses in the girder or truss and meant that longer spans could be built. Several nineteenth century engineers designed continuous bridges with hinge points mid-span. The use of a hinge in the multi-span system meant that engineers could better work out the loads and stresses on the bridge It also meant the bridge that could handle the foundations settling at different rates. 
Heinrich Gerber was one of the engineers to obtain a patent for a hinged girder (1866) and is recognized as the first to build one. The Hassfurt Bridge over the Main river in Germany has a central span of 124 feet (38 meters). Completed in 1867, it was the first modern cantilever bridge. Other early cantilever bridges included the High Bridge of Kentucky by C. Shaler Smith (1877), the Niagara Cantilever Bridge by Charles Conrad Schneider (1883) and the Poughkeepsie Bridge by John Francis O'Rourke and Pomeroy P. Dickinson (1889). The Kentucky River Bridge spanned a gorge that was 275 feet (84 meters) deep. It was built with a cantilver which meant that it did not need to be supported during the building. The most famous early cantilever bridge is the Forth Rail Bridge. This bridge held the record for longest span in the world for 17 years.
Benjamin Baker showed how the cantilever system worked in the photo on the left. The suspended span, where Kaichi Watanabe sits, is seen in the center. The need to resist compression of the lower chord is seen in the use of wooden poles while the tension of the upper chord is shown by the outstretched arms. The action of the outer foundations as anchors for the cantilever can be seen in the placement of the counterweights. 
A simple cantilever span is formed by two cantilever arms extending from opposite sides of the obstacle to be crossed, meeting at the center. With a suspended span, the cantilever arms do not meet in the center; instead, they support a central truss bridge which rests on the ends of the cantilever arms. The suspended span may be built off-site and lifted into place, or constructed in place using special traveling supports.
with as balanced cantilever, the span is balanced by cantilevers going in the opposite direction. If these are anchored into solid foundations, they are called anchor arms. In a bridge built on two foundation piers, there are four cantilever arms: two which span the obstacle, and two anchor arms which extend away from the obstacle. Because of the need for more strength at the balanced cantilever's supports, the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers. The Commodore Barry Bridge is an example of this type of cantilever bridge.
Steel truss cantilevers support loads by tension of the upper members and compression of the lower ones. Commonly, the structure distributes the tension through the anchor arms to the outermost supports, while the compression is carried to the foundations beneath the central towers.
Prestressed concrete balanced cantilever bridges are often built using segmental construction.
Some steel arch bridges (such as the Navajo Bridge) are built using pure cantilever spans from each side. These are then joined with a pin, usually after forcing the meeting point apart. When the jacks are removed and the bridge decking is added the bridge becomes a truss arch bridge. Such unsupported construction is only possible if suitable rock is available to support the tension in the upper chord of the span during construction, usually limiting this method to the spanning of narrow canyons.

Dallas Clark

Dallas Dean Clark (born June 12, 1979) is an American football tight end in the National Football League who is currently a free agent. He played college football for the University of Iowa. He was drafted 24th overall in the 2003 NFL Draft, and played his entire nine-year professional career for the Colts. He has been called a "hybrid" tight end due to his rare ability to play both the wide receiver and tight end positions well. However, injuries have made his career more difficult.
Clark played college football for the University of Iowa. Clark played for the Hawkeyes from 1999 through 2002. Clark was a first-team All-Big Ten selection, a first-team All-American, a John Mackey Award winner (2002, is given to the best tight end in college football. He won the Kenny Yana Award at the end of the 2002 season as well, as he helped lead Iowa to the Big Ten title and 11-2 record.
Clark was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts of the NFL in the 1st round (24th overall) of the 2003 NFL Draft. In Indianapolis, Clark wore #44. As a rookie, Clark started 10 games and had 340 receiving yards before his season ended with an injury. Clark continued his solid production over the next couple years, and in 2004 had an 80 yard touchdown, which is "extremely" rare for a tight end.
In 2006, Clark earned a Super Bowl ring when the Colts beat the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI. That season, Clark had 30 catches for 367 yards and four touchdowns.

Orc

An Orc is a mythical creature. In the 20th century, J. R. R. Tolkien gave orcs their traits: they are servitors of evil and small creatures. The word can probably be traced to Orcus. This is a different name for Pluto or Hades. Pliny the Elder writes about orcs in his "Naturalis historia". They are long-toothed sea monsters. Ludovico Ariosto (1474-1533)wrote an epic "Orlando Furioso": There, the virgin Angelica is captured by a sea monster called orc. The hero, Rogero, is able to free her as he rode a Hippogriff. The Latin name of the Killer Whale, "Orcinus orca" is likely to come from that story. There is another creature called "orc" in "Orlando Furioso": a blind man-eating giant who abducts King Norandin of Damascus and his lover Lucina. This orc cannot be vanquished; only fooled by trickery.
There is another Orc that lives in the Alps. It is a demon living on mountain tops. It sometimes is described as protector of the forest. At other times it is said to be an evil spirit who brings doom to cattle and wild beasts.
From the early Middle Ages, the orc was seen as an evil creature, much like other creatures of Celtic origin.

Azimuntium

Azimuntium (Azimus, or Esimontou) was a fortified town in Thracian region near the Illyrian border of the Eastern Roman Empire (present day Greece). The town is described by the Greek historian as the being the only one of the 182 forts and castles of Thrace to resist during the Attilan War of 443-446 A.D. and separately negotiating an exchange of captives with Attila after the peace was declared in 446 A.D.
The town is thought by Priscus to have still been in existence up the reign of the Emperor Justinian after which it "extirpated by the jealousy of the Roman princes". In Chapter 34 of his book "The history of the decline and fall of the Roman empire", Gibbons describes the town as follows:

Districts are not all the same size. They are roughly equivalent to a county in the United Kingdom or the United States. They are smaller than prefectures and larger than towns and villages.
Districts were established in the 8th century. 
Until the 10th century, the chief government official of a district ("gun") was called the "gunji". During the Edo period, the head of a district ("gun") was called the "gundai".
Between 1878 and 1921, the Meiji period and TaishÅ period, districts were given specific powers and responsibilities which are now diffused.

Weighted average

A weighted average is the average of values which are scaled by importance. The weighted average of values is the sum of weights times values divided by the sum of the weights.
Given two school classes, one with 20 students, and one with 30 students, the grades in each class on a test were:
The straight average for the morning class is 80 and the straight average of the afternoon class is 90. The straight average of 80 and 90 is 85, the mean of the two class means. However, this does not account for the difference in number of students in each class, hence the value of 85 does not reflect the average student grade (independent of class). The average student grade can be obtained by averaging all the grades, without regard to classes (add all the grades up and divide by the total number of students):
Or, this can be accomplished by weighting the class means by the number of students in each class (using a weighted mean of the class means):
Thus, the weighted mean makes it possible to find the average student grade in the case where only the class means and the number of students in each class are available.

David Coverdale

David 'Jack' Coverdale (born 22 September 1951) is an English rock singer. He is most famous for his work with hard rock band Whitesnake. The band was very successful commercially. During his early career Coverdale was the vocalist of Deep Purple for some time. He left the band to become a solo artist, and worked with Whitesnake. He also made an album with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. This was also successful.
Coverdale was born on 22 September 1951, in Saltburn-by-the-Sea, Redcar and Cleveland, England. His love for music developed early. Around the age of 14, he began performing professionally as he wanted to be a singer. He developed his style of singing then. "I don't think my voice had broken," he explained to "Sounds" in 1974. "And that's when I first learnt how to sing with my stomach, which sounds silly, but it's totally different from a normal voice." Coverdale had been the vocalist local bands like The Government (1968â1972); Fabulosa Brothers (1972â73).
In 1973, Coverdale saw an article in a copy of "Melody Maker", which said that Deep Purple was auditioning for singers to replace Ian Gillan. Coverdale was the frontman of a local group called The Government. They had played with Deep Purple in 1969. So both he and the band knew one another. Coverdale first sent a tape to the band. Then, he auditioned to become a singer. He was admitted into the band, with bassist Glenn Hughes being another vocalist.
In February 1974, Deep Purple released their first album with Coverdale and Hughes called "Burn" which was certified Gold in the US on 20 March 1974 and in the UK on 1 July. In April 1974, Coverdale and Deep Purple performed to over 200,000 music fans at the California Jam. . This was his first trip to America.
In December 1974 "Burn" was followed-up by "Stormbringer". This also ranked at Gold album status in the US and the UK. The album had funk and sould influences. So guitarist Ritchie Blackmore left the band in June 1975.
Coverdale did not want Deep Purple to disband. He helped in persuading the band to continue with American guitarist Tommy Bolin (of Billy Cobham and The James Gang). So Jon Lord said, "David Coverdale came up to me and said, 'Please keep the band together.' David played me the album that Tommy did with Billy Cobham. We liked his playing on it and invited Tommy to audition.'" The band released one studio album with Bolin, "Come Taste the Band" in 1975. The album was less successful than previous records. At the end of the tour in March 1976, Coverdale walked off in tears. He handed in his resignation. But he was told Deep Purple was disbanding. So he had no band left to quit. The decision to disband Deep Purple had been made some time before the last show by Lord and Ian Paice (the last remaining original members). Lord and Paice had not told anyone else. The break-up was finally made public in July 1976. Said Coverdale in an interview: "I was frightened to leave the band. Purple was my life, Purple gave me my break, but all the same I wanted out."
After the end of Deep Purple, Coverdale started a solo career. He released his first album in February 1977. It was called "White Snake". All songs were written by Coverdale and guitarist Micky Moody. Coverdale later said about this album: "It's very difficult to think back and talk sensibly about the first album. "White Snake" had been a very inward looking, reflective and low-key affair in many ways, written and recorded as it was in the aftermath of the collapse of Deep Purple." Even though the album was not successful, its title inspired the name of Coverdale's future band.
In 1978 Coverdale released his second solo album "Northwinds". It was received much better than "White Snake". But before the album's release, he had already formed a new band.
After recording "Northwinds", Coverdale soon formed the band Whitesnake. Bernie Marsden and Micky Moody played guitar in the band. It began as a touring band for Coverdale's first solo album. But, it soon developed into a full-time band. In early 1978, the band released the "Snakebite EP". It was repackaged later. It was released as a full album called "Snakebite", released in June 1978, with the B-side taken from Coverdale's "Northwinds" album. For the next album, "Trouble", Coverdale was joined by his former Deep Purple colleague, keyboardist Jon Lord. For Whitesnake's 1980 album, "Ready an' Willing", drummer Ian Paice also joined the group. "Ready an' Willing" also featured the band's biggest hit up to then. This was the song "Fool for Your Loving". It reached #13 on the British charts and #53 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. "Ready an' Willing" was followed up by the even more successful "Come an' Get It" in 1981. During 1982 Coverdale took some time off to look after his sick daughter. He decided to put Whitesnake on hold. When David Coverdale returned, he reformed the band. They recorded the album "Saints & Sinners" after this.
In 1982, according to British heavy metal magazine "Kerrang!", Coverdale was considered for the vocalist position with Black Sabbath following the departure of Ronnie James Dio. Coverdale declined.
Whitesnake became very popular in the UK, Europe, and Asia, but not in North America. In 1984, the album "Slide It In" finally entered the US charts (reaching #40). But it did not reach high enough to be considered a hit. When "Slide It In" was going to be released in the US, Coverdale made a calculated attempt at changing Whitesnake's sound and look. He recruited John Sykes from the remnants of Thin Lizzy for this. Sykes brought a more contemporary, aggressive guitar sound with him. He also had good stage manners to match. In 1985, Sykes and Coverdale started working on new songs for the next album. But Coverdale soon contracted a serious sinus infection. So he could not record that year. Doctors said he might not be able to sing again. Coverdale eventually recovered, and recordings were continued. But before their upcoming album was fully recorded and released, Coverdale had dismissed Sykes from the band.
In many period interviews, Coverdale stated that the next album was a make-or-break album for Whitesnake. If not successful, he would disband Whitesnake altogether. During 1987 and 1988, Whitesnake finally became successful in North America. They released the multi-platinum self-titled "Whitesnake" album. It was co-written (for most of the songs) by Sykes. But guitar was played by virtuoso Adrian Vandenberg, as a session musician.
The 1987 album has sold 8 times platinum since its release. It had hit singles like "Here I Go Again" and "Is This Love". It finally made Whitesnake a concert headliner in North America. Through the late 80s and early 90s, in the "hair-band" era, Coverdale kept Whitesnake going with great success. But lineups changed many times.
In 1989 Coverdale recruited Vandenberg to recorded a new album, "Slip of the Tongue". Vandenberg co-wrote the entire album with Coverdale. But he had a wrist injury. So he could not do solo guitar. Fellow virtuoso Steve Vai was recruited. He re-recorded most of Vandenberg's existing parts and finished the album. Upon release, it was very successful in Europe and the U.S.
The following tour, for which Vandenberg returned to play along with Vai, made Whitesnake famous as a giant in the world of hard rock. The album peaked at number 10 in the U.S., and has achieved platinum status. The tour continued until the end of 1990.
Coverdale did not want to be in Whitesnake any more. He had grown uncomfortable with what he thinks Whitesnake had become. He admits that he got "caught up in it". In a candid period interview, Coverdale sums it up in one sentence: "It got louder and louder, and so did I, to the point now where I have to get dressed up like a "girly man" and tease ones questionable bangs or hair and it's all becoming a bit... boring."
In 1990 Coverdale sang and co-wrote (with Hans Zimmer and Billy Idol) the song "The Last Note of Freedom" for the Tony Scott movie "Days of Thunder".
On 26 September 1990, after the last show on the "Slip of the Tongue" tour in Tokyo, Coverdale disbanded Whitesnake indefinitely. He was tired of the business in general and troubled by his separation and later divorce from Tawny Kitaen. Coverdale wanted to find other values in life. He took "private time to reflect" and think where his career was going.
The hiatus did not last long. In the early spring of 1991, Coverdale collaborated with guitarist Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin fame. Both of them have said that the collaboration revitalized them on many levels. This collaboration led to the "Coverdale-Page" album. It was released in March 1993. The album was a hit all over the world. It reached number 4 in the UK and number 5 in the US. It was certified Platinum in the US on 7 April 1995. But the US tour for the album had to be cancelled due to slow ticket sales. After only a limited Japanese tour, Coverdale and Page parted ways. In part, the problem had been the comparison to Robert Plant who had been the Led Zeppelin vocalist, with Jimmy Page. Some of their audience criticized Coverdale. They thought he was too similar to Plant. Others felt the collaboration only served to inspire Page to once again join Plant, a year later.
In 1994 Coverdale assembled a new line-up of Whitesnake (with the exception of Coverdale's musical partner, guitarist Adrian Vandenberg and bassist Rudy Sarzo, both of whom had been in Whitesnake since 1987). Whitesnake was to tour for the release of their "Greatest Hits" album. The band again broke-up after the tour. After this Coverdale once again went away from the music business, for three years. In 1997 Coverdale returned and released "Restless Heart" (with Vandenberg on guitar). The album was originally meant to be Coverdale's solo album. But the record company forced it to be released under the name of "David Coverdale & Whitesnake". The tour was called Whitesnake's farewell tour, during which Coverdale and Vandenberg played two unplugged shows (one in Japan and the other for VH1). The first of the two shows was released the next year under the title "Starkers in Tokyo". After the Restless Heart-tour ended, Coverdale once again ended Whitesnake and took another short break from music.
In 2000 Coverdale released his first solo album in 22 years, titled "Into The Light". The album was not a hit. But it did return Coverdale to the music business.
In December 2002, Coverdale re-reformed Whitesnake for an American and European tour, with Tommy Aldridge on drums, Marco Mendoza (bass), Doug Aldrich (guitar), Reb Beach (guitar) and keyboardist Timothy Drury. In 2004-2005, Whitesnake went on a tour of the United States, South America and Europe. A live DVD, shot during the 2005 tour at the legendary Hammersmith Apollo was released in February 2006. In June 2006, Coverdale signed a new record deal with Steamhammer Records. The first release under the record label was the double live album "" (released 27 November 2006). The album also contained 4 brand new studio tracks. They were written by Coverdale and Aldrich.
In 2008 the band (with new bassist and drummer) released its first new studio album in over 10 years titled "Good to Be Bad". The band toured for the album extensively. Also in 2008, Whitesnake went on a European Tour with fellow Yorkshire rock band Def Leppard.
In 2009, Whitesnake toured with Judas Priest on the "British Steel" Anniversary Tour. On 11 August 2009, Whitesnake was playing a show at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado, when Coverdale suffered a vocal injury. After seeing a specialist, it was announced on 12 August 2009 that Coverdale is suffering from severe vocal fold edema. He has a left vocal fold vascular lesion. The rest of their tour with Judas Priest was cancelled.
In early February 2010, David Coverdale has announced his voice seems to have fully recovered from the injury. He says he's been recording new demos. He wants to create a new Whitesnake album. On tape his voice is sounding full and strong. The latest Whitesnake studio album "Forevermore" was released on 25 March 2011, with Aldrich and Beach on board.
Coverdale was first married in 1974 to Julia, and their daughter Jessica was born in 1978. Coverdale's second marriage was to actress Tawny Kitaen, from 17 February 1989. They divorced in April 1991. Kitaen was known for her provocative appearances in Whitesnake's music videos for "Here I Go Again", "Is This Love" and "Still of the Night." Since 1997, he has been married to Cindy, an author with works such as "The Food That Rocks." They have a son, Jasper (born 1996).
On 1 March 2007, Coverdale became a U.S. citizen, in a ceremony in Reno. He now holds dual US/UK citizenship. He has lived near Lake Tahoe, Nevada for more than 20 years.

Super Bowl XL was an American football game in the National Football League between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Pittsburgh Steelers against the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Seattle Seahawks to decide the Super Bowl champion for the 2005 season. Played on February 5, 2006, at Ford Field in Detroit, the Steelers beat the Seahawks, 21-10. Steelers receiver Hines Ward, who caught 5 passes for 123 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 18 yards, was named Super Bowl MVP. Pittsburgh finished the regular season with an 11-5 record and became the fourth wild card team, and third in nine years, to win the Super Bowl. Pittsburgh also became the first #6 seed in the NFL playoffs to win a Super Bowl (and the first #6 seed to win a conference title). The Steelers became the second franchise, following the Oakland Raiders, to appear in the Super Bowl in four different decades (1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s), and the first to appear in four consecutive decades. Also, Steelers runningback Jerome Bettis was able win a Super Bowl thanks to this game.
However, many have criticized the officiating in that game, as they believe Seattle was cheated during some questionable calls by referee Bill Leavy.

Gulf of Honduras

The Gulf or Bay of Honduras is a large inlet of the Caribbean Sea. It indents the coasts of Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras. From north to south, it runs for approximately 200Â km from Dangriga, Belize, to La Ceiba, Honduras.
The inner Gulf of Honduras is lined by the Belize Barrier Reef. It forms the southern part of the 900Â km long Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. This is the second-largest coral reef system in the world. The Belize Barrier Reef has a number of small islands. They are called cays, and collectively known as the Pelican Cays.
The Gulf of Honduras contains complex dynamics of coastal and open waters, and ocean currents. These have produced a very diverse and unique ecosystem with a wide variety of coastal marine waters. It includes coastline estuaries, barrier beaches, lagoons, intertidal salt marshes, mangrove forests, seagrass beds, keys and barrier reefs.
The gulf receives the runoff from the watersheds of 12 rivers . They discharge at 1232 mÂ³ s. These rivers include the Moho, SarstÃºn, RÃ­o Dulce, Motagua, and UlÃºa. Volume of sediment from these rivers is increasing. This damages the marine ecosystem.
Many American anglers visit the Gulf of Honduras to catch the marlin that abound there. Tourists are often taken on boat trips to the Pelican Cays, notably Caye Caulker and Ambergris Caye.
In 1961 Hurricane Hattie swept across the Gulf of Honduras. It destroyed buildings in Belize.

The Swan Islands, or Islas Santanilla, are a chain of three islands. They are in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. They are about ninety miles off the coastline of Honduras. They have a land area of . 
They are within the EEZ of Honduras and belong to the Islas de la BahÃ­a department of Honduras. They consist of three islands:
Rosario Bank and Misteriosa Bank are 130 to 150Â km north of the Swan Islands. The >5000 metres deep Cayman Trench separates them.
The islands have no people in them, except for a small Honduran navy garrison. Great Swan has a 3800â² (1158 m) grass airstrip (ICAO code MHIC, IATA code SWA).
Both the United States and Honduras claimed the Swan Islands until the United States dropped its claim. This was under the Guano Islands Act in 1972. The islands gained attention in the early 1960s. This was because of Radio Swan, which began broadcasting in May 1960 during preparation for, and during, the Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba. The station was removed from the islands in the late 1960s. Its main transmitter was transferred for use in the Vietnam War.
In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch moved over Swan Island with winds of 180Â mph.

Matthew Hopkins

Matthew Hopkins (c. 1620 â 12 August 1647) was a witch-hunter. His 3-year career began in 1645 during the time of the English Civil War and ended in 1647. Matthew and his colleague John Stearne were responsible for the rising number of witch hunts during that time. At the end, more people were hanged for being witches because of Hopkins and Stearnes accusations than in the previous 100 years. It is believed the number of deaths due to them was about 300 women. His witchhunts mainly took place in the eastern counties of Suffolk, Essex, Norfolk, and occasionally in Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, and Huntingdonshire. 
Very little is known of Matthew Hopkins before 1644. There are no documents from that time about him or his family. He was born in Great Wenham, Suffolk. His father, James Hopkins, was a Puritan clergyman in Suffolk. 
Hopkins wrote in his book "The Discovery of Witches" that he "never travelled far... to gain his experience".
In the early 1640s Hopkins moved to Manningtree, Essex near Colchester. According to tradition Hopkins used his inheritance to establish himself as a gentleman and to buy the Thorn Inn in Mistley.
From the way that he gave evidence in trials, Hopkins is thought to have been trained as a lawyer, but there is little evidence to prove this.
Matthew Hopkins died at his home in Manningtree, Essex, on 12 August 1647, probably of tuberculosis.

Inflow (meteorology)

Inflow is the flow of a fluid into a large collection of that fluid. In meteorology, inflow normally means the influx (entry) of warmth and moisture from air within the Earth's atmosphere into storm systems. Extratropical cyclones are created by inflow focused along their cold front and warm fronts. Tropical cyclones need a large inflow of warmth and moisture from warm oceans to become very powerful, mainly within the lowest of the atmosphere. Once the thunderstorms and their associated tornadoes do not get the flow of warm and moist air, the storms begin to dissipate.

Hurricane Bob (1985)

Hurricane Bob was a hurricane that affected the southeast United States in July 1985. It was the second tropical storm and first hurricane of the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season. The system developed from a tropical wave on July 21 in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Bob began moving east. It struck southwestern Florida as a weak tropical storm. The storm then turned to the north. It quickly became more intense and was promoted to hurricane status on July 24. The next day, it made landfall near Beaufort, South Carolina. It became one of a record-tying six hurricanes to hit the United States during a single season. Bob quickly weakened over land. It was absorbed by a frontal trough over eastern West Virginia on July 26.
Bob caused $20Â million in damage and five indirect deaths. In Florida, the storm produced heavy rainfall. It peaked at over in Everglades City. In most areas, the rainfall was beneficial due to dry conditions that had persisted throughout the year. Damage was minimal in South Carolina, where the hurricane made its final landfall. In Virginia, the storm spawned three tornadoes, one of which destroyed two houses.

Cudjoe Key, Florida

Cudjoe Key is a census-designated place in Monroe County, Florida. It is on an island of the same name in the lower Florida Keys. As of the 2000 census, the CDP had a total population of 1,695.
It was originally called Littleton Island.
The United States Army activated Cudjoe Key Air Force Station in 1959. It was to track missiles traveling through the Eglin Gulf Test Range. The Air Force took over operations the next year. After this, it became a detached installation of Homestead Joint Air Reserve Base. The station flies a white radar aerostat. It is known locally as "Fat Albert". This is used for drug interdiction missions by the Drug Enforcement Administration. On April 20, 2007 a Cessna 182 crashed after its left wing struck the tether anchoring "Fat Albert" . The aerostat is marked on air navigation charts inside a restricted area. The area has the warning, "Caution: Unmarked balloon on cable to 14,000 [feet]."
It is possibly named after the Joewood tree ("Jacquinia keyensis"), a native species. It is also known as cudjoewood. But writer John Viele of Summerland Key gives a better reason for its name. He believes that Cudjoe, a very common West African name, was the name of a fugitive slave or free negro who lived on the island at some point before to Gerdes' survey in 1849.
Cudjoe Key is located at (24.664298, -81.482339).
U.S. 1 (or the Overseas Highway) crosses the key at approximately mile markers 20.5Â â 23, between Summerland Key and Sugarloaf Key.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 14.6 km (5.6 mi). 13.6Â km (5.2Â mi) of it is land and 1.0Â km (0.4Â mi) of it (6.93%) is water.
As of the census of 2000, there were 1,695 people, 799 households, and 541 families living in the CDP. The population density was 124.9/km (323.6/mi). There were 1,482 housing units. The average density was 109.2/km (282.9/mi). The racial constitution of the CDP was 96.22% White, 0.88% African American, 0.47% Native American, 0.88% Asian, 0.12% Pacific Islander, 0.71% from other races, and 0.71% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.66% of the population.
15.6% of the households had children under the age of 18 living with them. 62.0% were married couples living together. 3.4% had a female householder with no husband present. 32.2% were non-families. 21.7% of all households were made up of a single person and 7.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.12 and the average family size was 2.43.
12.2% residents were under the age of 18, 3.7% from 18 to 24, 27.1% from 25 to 44, 38.8% from 45 to 64, and 18.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The average age was 48 years. For every 100 females there were 108.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 109.4 males.
The median income for a household in the CDP was $57,500, and the median income for a family was $59,883. Males had a median income of $36,094 versus $31,250 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $27,085. About 4.4% of families and 5.8% of the population were below the poverty line.

<doc id="333964" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=333964" title="Tay Rail Bridge">
Tay Rail Bridge

The Tay Bridge (or Tay Rail Bridge) is a railway bridge about two and a quarter miles (three and a half kilometres) long that spans the Firth of Tay in Scotland, between the city of Dundee and Wormit, Fife ().
As with the Forth Rail Bridge, the Tay Bridge has been called the Tay Rail Bridge since the construction of the Tay Road Bridge over the firth. The original rail bridge replaced an early train ferry.
The present Tay Bridge is the second Rail bridge over the Tay. The first one collapsed in 1879 in a storm, with great loss of life.
The original Tay Bridge was designed by noted railway engineer Thomas Bouch, who received a knighthood when the bridge was completed. It was a lattice-grid design, combining cast and wrought iron. The design was well known: it was used with success in the Crumlin Viaduct in South Wales in 1858, after the use of cast iron in the Crystal Palace.
A previous cast iron design, the Dee bridge which collapsed in 1847, failed due to poor use of cast-iron girders. Later, Gustave Eiffel used a similar design to create several large viaducts in the Massif Central (1867).
Proposals for constructing a bridge across the River Tay date back to at least 1854. The North British Railway (Tay Bridge) Act received the Royal Assent on 15 July 1870 and the foundation stone was laid on 22 July 1871.
The original design was for lattice girders supported by brick piers resting on bedrock shown by trial borings to lie at no great depth under the river. At either end of the bridge the single rail track ran on top of the bridge girder, most of which therefore lay below the pier tops. However, in the centre section of the bridge (the âhigh girdersâ) the railway ran inside the bridge girder, which could then run above the pier tops to give the required clearance to allow passage of sailing ships upriver (e.g. to Perth).
However as the bridge extended out into the river, it became clear in December 1873, that the bedrock really lay much deeper; too deep to act as a foundation for the bridge piers. Bouch had to redesign the bridge.
He reduced the number of piers and increased the span of the girders. The pier foundations were no longer taken down to bedrock; instead they were constructed by sinking brick-lined wrought-iron caissons onto the riverbed,
The company which had the contract for building the bridge went bankrupt while Bouch was redesigning the bridge. The replacement company did poor work. Almost every part of the bridge was substandard, including the iron and the ties and fixings. Lack of precision in the bolts and braces led to ad hoc on-site fixes, described by one witness at the later inquiry as "about as slovenly a piece of work as ever I saw in my life".
The bridge was opened for passenger traffic on 1 June 1878. The next year, on June 20 1879, Queen Victoria crossed the bridge to return south from Balmoral. Bouch was presented to her before she did so, and on June 26th 1879 he was knighted by the Queen at Windsor Castle.
On the night of 28 December 1879 at 7.15pm, the bridge collapsed after its central spans gave way during high winter gales. A train with six carriages carrying seventy-five passengers and crew, crossing at the time of the collapse, plunged into the icy waters of the Tay. All seventy-five were lost. The disaster stunned the whole country and sent shock waves through the Victorian engineering community.
At the time a gale estimated at force ten or eleven (Tropical Storm force winds: 55â72Â mph/80â117Â km/hr) had been blowing down the Tay estuary at right angles to the bridge. The engine itself was salvaged from the river and restored to the railways for service.
The collapse of the bridge, opened only nineteen months earlier and passed as safe by the Board of Trade, is still the most famous bridge disaster in the British Isles. The stumps of the original bridge piers are still visible above the surface of the Tay even at high tide.
The inquiry held that "the fall of the bridge was occasioned by the insufficiency of the cross-bracings and fastenings to sustain the force of the gale on the night of December 28th 1879 and that the bridge had been previously strained by other gales".
However, this is not a finding that the bridge "as designed" would have failed. The engineer appointed to carry out detailed investigations testified: 
The section in the middle of the bridge, where the rail ran inside high girders, was potentially top-heavy and very vulnerable to high winds. Neither Bouch nor the contractor appeared to have regularly visited the on-site foundry where iron from the previous half-built bridge was recycled. The cylindrical cast iron columns supporting the 13Â longest spans of the bridge, each 245Â ft (75 m) long, were of poor quality. Many had been cast horizontally, with the result that the walls were not of even thickness, and there was some evidence that imperfect castings were disguised from the (very inadequate) quality control inspections.
In particular, some of the lugs used as attachment points for the wrought iron bracing bars had been "burnt on" rather than cast with the columns. Even the normal lugs were very weak. They were tested for the Inquiry, and proved to break at only about rather than the expected load of . These lugs failed and destabilised the entire centre of the bridge during the storm.
Put into simple words, the bridge failed because of defects in its manufacture. This meant it did not reach the standards of wind resistance intended by the designer.
A new double-track bridge was designed by William Henry Barlow. It was built by William Arrol & Co. upstream of, and parallel to, the original bridge. The foundation stone laid on 6 July 1883. Construction involved of iron and steel, of concrete, ten million bricks (weighing ) and three million rivets. Fourteen men lost their lives during its construction, most by drowning.
The second bridge opened on 13 July 1887 and is still in use. In 2003, a Â£20.85Â million strengthening and refurbishment project (Â£ as of ), on the bridge was completed. More than of bird droppings were scraped off the ironwork lattice of the bridge using hand tools, and bagged into sacks. Hundreds of thousands of rivets were removed and replaced. All work was done in very exposed conditions high over fast-running tides in the river.

Carlotta Grisi

Carlotta Grisi (June 28, 1819 â May 20, 1899) was an Italian ballet dancer. She was famous for creating the role of "Giselle". 
Grisi was born in Visinada, Istria (now part of Croatia). Her real name was Caronne Adele Josephine Marie Grisi. She was trained at the ballet school of Teatro alla Scala in Milan. 
At her 1836 debut in London, Grisi danced with Jules Perrot. She next appeared in Paris at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre de la Renaissance in 1840. A year later, she toured with Perrot to Paris, London, Vienna, Munich, and Milan. By dancing Perrot's choreography, she gained both public and critical acclaim. 
Her greatest role was Giselle. The world premiÃ¨re of this two-act ballet was on June 28, 1841 at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre de l'AcadÃ©mie Royale de Musique, Paris. The ballet caused a sensation. It inspired reviewers to proclaim "Giselle" to be the greatest ballet of its time. The ballet immediately established Grisi as a star in her very first full-length ballet in Paris. Her salary grew from 5,000 francs to 12,000 in 1842 and 20,000 by 1844, with additional performance fees on top. It also marked the beginning of a change in her relationship with Jules Perrot. Grisi's last performance in the west was in Paul Taglioni's "Les MÃ©tamorphoses" (aka "Satanella", 1849).
In 1850, she joined Perrot in St. Petersburg, Russia. He had been appointed balletmaster to the Imperial Ballet. She danced "Giselle" at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre. The first Giselle in Russia had been danced by Fanny Elssler. The initial reaction to Grisi's interpretation of the role was not enthusiastic. Over time, the Russians came to appreciate her talents. She was "Prima Ballerina" of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres in St. Petersburg from 1850 to 1853. She worked with Perrot and also Joseph Mazilier. 
In 1854, she left Russia for Warsaw with her daughter. She intended to continue dancing. She became pregnant by Prince LÃ©on Radziwill. He persuaded her to retire from ballet. Grisi gave birth to her second daughter, LÃ©ontine Grisi. She settled in Saint-Jean, Geneva, to spend the next forty-six years of her life in peaceful retirement. She died in Saint Jean on May 20, 1899. Her tomb is located in "CimetiÃ¨re de ChÃ¢telaine". One of "Giselle"'s creators, ThÃ©ophile Gautier described her dancing as having a childlike artlessness, a happy and infectious gaiety.

<doc id="333988" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=333988" title="Romantic ballet">
Romantic ballet

The Romantic ballet is a genre of ballet that evolved in the early 19th century as a reaction against the classicism that dominated 18th century art and literature. Balletomanes of the early nineteenth century were bored with stories about ancient gods and goddesses, plots based on myths, and ancient costumes. They wanted ballets about real people and real places. "Pointe" work became artistic expression rather than stunt work, and the long, white, ballet skirt of tulle was introduced. Both produced the illusion of ethereal weightlessness. Gas lighting made capable special dimming effects and wires made it possible for ballerinas to "fly". 
The romantic era in ballet began with "The Ballet of the Nuns" in 1831 and was followed by "La Sylphide" in 1832. The genre began a slow decline. "CoppÃ©lia" of 1870 is said to mark the end of the romantic ballet, although the three ballets composed by Tchaikovsky are romantic ballets. Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" of 1876 is considered a romantic ballet. Even his "The Nutcracker" of 1892 is a romantic ballet. Michel Fokine's "Les Sylphides" of 1906 is considered a tribute to the romantic ballet in its atmosphere and tone. 
Romantic ballets have four things in common: they are about real people rather than mythological gods and goddesses; they employ local or national color in costumes, settings, and dances such as mazurkas and waltzes; a supernatural, fantastic, exotic, or spiritual element is usually prominent; and ballet technique is a focus, especially "pointe" work for the ballerina.

The Bolte Bridge is a large twin cantilever bridge in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It crosses the Yarra River and Victoria Harbour in the Docklands area to the west of the Melbourne CBD. It forms part of the CityLink system of toll roads that joins the Tullamarine Freeway from the northern suburbs with the West Gate Freeway and the Domain and Burnley tunnels to the Monash Freeway and the south eastern suburbs.
The bridge was designed by architects Denton Corker Marshall. It was built for Transurban by Baulderstone Hornibrook, from 1996â1999 and cost AU$75 million. It was named by Jeff Kennett, for former Premier of Victoria, Sir Henry Bolte because it linked the West Gate, Monash and Tullamarine Freeways - projects planned or completed by the Bolte Government.
It is one of the largest balanced cantilever cast in situ box girder bridges in Australia. It is built as two separate bridges of variable depth, prestressed concrete box girders, separated by a gap between the structures.
The bridge has two high silver towers. These are on either side of the roadway at the middle of the bridge's span. These two towers are only for show, and are not joined to the main body of the bridge. The towers are hollow, and have ladders leading to a small roof top hatch. The Bolte Bridge has four spans with two main spans of and side spans of . The total length of the bridge is . The twin bridge has two wide decks, each with three lanes of vehicles. There is no access for cyclists or pedestrians.
Other bridges in Australia built in the same way are the Gateway Bridge, Brisbane and Mooney Mooney Bridge near Gosford, north of Sydney.

There are 99 counties in the U.S. state of Iowa. The first two counties, Des Moines County and Dubuque County, were formed in 1834 when Iowa was still part of the Michigan Territory. One of the most important days in Iowa county history was January 15, 1851, when 49 counties were created.
The Iowa Constitution of 1857, which is still in effect today, states that counties must have an area of at least . No county be reduced below that size by boundary changes. Exceptions to this rule were granted, as ten counties have areas below this size. The smallest county (Dickinson) has a land area of , while the largest (Kossuth) has an area 973sq mi (2,520Â kmÂ²). Polk County is the most densely populated county at 657 persons/sq mi, and contains the state's capital and largest city, Des Moines.
The number in the column headed "#" is the one used on the map from the National Atlas of the United States, shown on the left. The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify counties, is provided with each entry. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county.

Maribyrnong River Viaduct

The Maribyrnong River Viaduct (also known as the Quarter Mile Bridge) is a railway bridge across the Maribyrnong River in the western suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. It is near the E.J. Whitten Bridge, and almost 400 metres long (hence the quarter mile name). The Albion-Jacana railway line uses the bridge, which is mainly used for freight. It also carries the Melbourne to Sydney CountryLink XPT. It is the second highest bridge in Victoria, only behind the West Gate Bridge (58 metres). At a height of 180 feet (54.86 m) above the water, it is even higher than the Sydney Harbour Bridge (52 metres). The bridge is 1257 feet (383.13 m) long
It was built in 1927â29 by the Victorian Railways Construction Branch, being the largest trestle bridge in Australia when completed in June, 1929. It is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register and employed 200 people during construction, with one fatality.

Bridge of Sighs

The Bridge of Sighs (Italian: Ponte dei Sospiri) is a small bridge in Venice, northern Italy. The bridge has walls and a roof. It is made of white limestone and has windows with stone bars. It passes over the Rio di Palazzo and connects the old prisons to the interrogation rooms in the Doge's Palace. It was designed by Antoni Contino (whose uncle Antonio da Ponte had designed the Rialto Bridge), and built in 1602.
The view from the windows of the Bridge of Sighs was the last view of Venice that convicts saw before their imprisonment. The bridge was named by Lord Byron in the 19th century. It was thought that prisoners would sigh at their final view of beautiful Venice through the windows before being taken down to their cells. In reality, the days of inquisitions and summary executions were over by the time the bridge was built and the cells under the palace roof were occupied mostly by small-time criminals. In addition, little could be seen from inside the Bridge due to the stone grills covering the windows. 
A local legend says that lovers will be granted everlasting love and bliss if they kiss on a gondola at sunset under the bridge.
The name "Bridge of Sighs" has since been applied by association to other similar covered bridges around the world, including:

Jonathan Nolan

Jonathan Nolan is a British-American author and screenwriter. He is the brother of movie director Christopher Nolan. Jonathan Nolan's story "Memento Mori"was made into a critically acclaimed film "Memento". He has also co-written screenplays for "The Prestige" and "The Dark Knight", with his brother. In movie credits, his name has appeared as Jonah.
He was born in London, England, to an English father and American mother. He was raised in the Chicago area. Nolan attended Loyola Academy in Illinois. He graduated from there in 1994, and then graduated from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., in 1999. In this university, he studied English and was a staff writer for "The Hoya".
His brother, Christopher, speaks with a British English accent, but Jonathan speaks with an American English accent.
Nolan tells about successful work relationship with his brother in the production notes of "The Prestige": "Iâve always suspected that it has something to do with the fact that heâs left-handed and Iâm right-handed, because heâs somehow able to look at my ideas and flip them around in a way thatâs just a little bit more twisted and interesting. Itâs great to be able to work with him like that."
On March 23, 2007, it was announced he would pen "Interstellar", a science fiction film. It is based on the theories of Kip Thorne, a theoretical physicist who is known for his theories in gravitation physics and astrophysics and for having trained a generation of scientists. The film was first reported to be directed by Steven Spielberg and eventually settled with Christopher Nolan as director and is released in 2014.
Nolan is currently working with his brother for "The Dark Knight Rises". It is the third Batman movie.
On February 10, 2011, Nolan's TV pilot "Person of Interest" had been picked up by CBS and plan was to make it in a TV show. The show was officially picked up by CBS on May 13, 2011, and will star Michael Emerson, Jim Caviezel, and Taraji P. Henson. It will be produced by J. J. Abrams. His company Bad Robot Productions will produce it. Nolan will be the executive producer.

Afrikaner nationalism

Afrikaner nationalism is a political ideology which was created in the 19th century in South Africa. There is an ethnic group called Afrikaner in South Africa. Afrikaner nationalism is the idea that the Afrikaner are "chosen people". It says that Afrikaners who speak their language should unite to fight off foreign influences that come from English-speaking settlers of South Africa, black people or Jews. 
The historian T. Dunbar Moodie describes Afrikaner nationalism as a kind of civil religion that combined the history of the Afrikaners, their language and the Afrikaner Calvinism as key symbols. A major proponent of the ideology was the secret "Broederbond" organization and the National Party that ruled the country from 1948 to 1994. Other organisations aligned with the Afrikaner nationalistic ideology were the Federation of Afrikaans Cultural Organisations ("Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurvereniginge ", FAK), the Institute for Christian National Education and the White Workers' Protection Association.

Numerical analysis

Numerical analysis studies different algorithms to get approximations for problems of mathematical analysis. Approximations are used for the following reasons:
One of the earliest known uses of numerical analysis is a Babylonian clay tablet, which approximates the square root of 2. In a unit square, the diagonal has this length. Being able to compute the sides of a triangle is extremely important, for instance, in carpentry and construction.
Numerical analysis continues this long tradition of practical mathematical calculations. Much like the Babylonian approximation of formula_1, modern numerical analysis does not seek exact answers, because exact answers are often impossible to obtain in practice. Instead, much of numerical analysis is concerned with obtaining approximate solutions while maintaining reasonable bounds on errors.
Numerical analysis naturally finds applications in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, but in the 21stÂ century, the life sciences and even the arts have adopted elements of scientific computations. Ordinary differential equations appear in star movement; optimization occurs in portfolio management; numerical linear algebra is important for data analysis; stochastic differential equations and Markov chains are essential in simulating living cells for medicine and biology.
Computers greatly helped this task. Before there were computers, numerical methods often depended on hand interpolation in large printed tables. Since the mid 20th century, computers calculate the required functions instead. These same interpolation formulas nevertheless continue to be used as part of the software algorithms for solving differential equations.

As people settled the backcountry, judicial districts and additional counties were formed. This structure continued and grew after the Revolutionary War. In 1800, all counties were renamed as districts. In 1868, the districts were changed back to counties.

Interpolation

In many domains of science, measurements are done. If these measurements are drawn in a graph, they will be shown as simple unconnected points. Such data are called data points, or discrete. Handling and analysis of the data is easier, if it can be described using a continuous function, or a line connecting the discrete data point together. In order to do this, the line between two measurements, or data points, need to be created. This process of connecting the data points together with a line called interpolation. There are different ways to invent the data, such as simply drawing a straight line between two data points, which is not very accurate, or using polynomials to create a more accurate representation. In many cases, the results of this interpolation are usable, either as a replacement for missing data points, or as a tool to help understand more complicated data.
Interpolation tries to find the values between two known points of data. It is not to be confused with extrapolation, which is a similar process that tries to find data points at the edge or outside the currently defined points.
The primary use of interpolation is to help users, be they scientists, photographers, engineers or mathematicians, determine what data might exist outside of their collected data. Outside the domain of mathematics, interpolation is frequently used to scale images and to convert the sampling rate of digital signals.
In the domain of science, a scientist may need to use a computer to calculate a complicated function. However, if that function takes a very long time to compute, it may make her experiments difficult or impossible to run properly. So, she might use interpolation to create a slightly less complicated version of her function, which takes less computational time and energy to run. This interpolated function should achieve the same results as the more complex function, but will make some errors, or lose some detail as compared to the original function. However, the reduced time and cost of running the interpolated function may make this trade-off worthwhile.
When an image is made larger, the existing pixels cannot simply be stretched, as you might stretch a rubber band. Instead, new pixels must be created. In order to "guess" what these pixels should look like, the software that enlarges the image uses interpolation. The software first spreads out the existing pixels into the new image size, leaving many gaps and spaces. Then, it examines the existing data (the original pixels) and then creates a function that describes the missing data (the new pixels) to create a new data set (the enlarged image). Sometimes, the program does a poor job, and the resulting image is blurry or wrong in places. These are called interpolation errors - the software did not correctly guess what the data should be. But, overall, the image will look similar. This is an example of the risks and benefits of interpolation - the user can see new data, but that data may not be perfect.

Gay icon

A gay icon is a prominent person (either living or dead) who is liked by the gay community. Gay icons are often glamourous and even flamboyant. They show strength through adversity. They often show a blend of masculine and feminine traits. Sometimes they show no gender traits at all. Gay icons can be male or female. They can be gay, straight, bisexual, or asexual. If they are gay, they can be openly gay or not. Sometimes living gay icons support LGBT causes, sometimes they do not. Some gay icons from history are tragic figures like Saint Sebastian, Oscar Wilde, or Judy Garland. Some more modern gay icons are entertainers like Ellen DeGeneres, BeyoncÃ©, Lady Gaga,Cher, Barbra Streisand, Liza Minnelli, and Freddie Mercury.

Afternoon of a Faun (Nijinsky)

The Afternoon of a Faun () is a modern ballet. It was choreographed by Nijinsky to a short symphonic work by Claude Debussy called "PrÃ©lude Ã  l'aprÃ¨s-midi d'un faune". Both the music and the ballet were inspired by the poem "L'aprÃ¨s-midi d'un faune" by StÃ©phane MallarmÃ©. It was Nijinsky's first choreographed work. The ballet was first performed by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in Paris at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre du ChÃ¢telet on 29 May 1912. The costumes and sets were designed by LÃ©on Bakst. Nijinsky danced the role of the faun. 
Grace Robert writes in "The Borzoi Book of Ballet" that Bakst was responsible for the choreography. Nijinsky simply carried out his directions. However, Nijinsky's sister alleged that Bakst and Diaghilev were not involved with the choreography and were admitted to rehearsals only in the last stages. The truth will never be known; those involved are dead. The choreography however caused a scandal, especially the ending. Here, the Faun appears to climax upon a Nymph's scarf. Gaston Calmette, the editor of "Le Figaro", attacked the choreography on moral grounds. Sculptor Auguste Rodin defended it. The furor assured the public's interest in the ballet, then and now. 
The first American performance occurred in New York City on January 17, 1916. The Catholic Theatre Movement decided the ending should be modified. The ending was duly altered. Diaghilev told the head of the Metropolitan Opera House, "America is saved." Thereafter, the ballet saw a variety of manifestations until 1936 when a close facsimile of the original was presented at the Metropolitan by Colonel W. de Basil's Ballets Russes. Grace Robert believes the original ballet was produced as an aesthetic antidote to Isadore Duncan's copycats and their Greek dances. 
Lincoln Kirstein describes the story: "A faun lolls on a hillock ... Seven nymphs in chain step shuffle past him ... Curious, the Faun descends to watch. Curious, then alarmed, they flee, to return shyly. The Faun tries to play with them, but they are frightened by this half-boy, half-beast. The least shy ... returns; they link arms. Contact frightens her; she escapes, dropping her scarf ... she is eager to stay, but the creature seems too theatening. Leaping onto his rock, he carries her scarf ... Arching his body, he thrusts his length into it."

<doc id="334233" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=334233" title="Victoria Falls Bridge">
Victoria Falls Bridge

The Victoria Falls Bridge crosses the Zambezi River just below the Victoria Falls and is built over the Second Gorge of the falls. The river is the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia. The bridge has border posts on both ends, at the towns of Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe and Livingstone, Zambia.
The bridge was the idea of Cecil Rhodes. It was part of his grand plan to build a railway from Cape Town to Cairo. He never visited the falls and died before the building of the bridge began. Rhodes told the engineers to "build the bridge across the Zambezi where the trains, as they pass, will catch the spray of the Falls". It was designed by George Anthony Hobson, of consultants Sir Douglas Fox and Partners, not as is often stated, Sir Ralph Freeman, the same engineer who designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Freeman, who also worked for Sir Douglas Fox and Partners, did the calculation of stresses for the bridge.
The bridge was built in England by the Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company. It was then shipped to the Mozambique port of Beira and transported on the newly built railway to the Victoria Falls. It took just 14 months to put together and was completed in 1905. 
The bridge was officially opened by Professor George Darwin, son of Charles Darwin, and President of the British Association (now the Royal Society) on 12 September 1905. The American Society of Civil Engineers lists the bridge as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.
Made from steel, the bridge is long, with a main arch spanning . It is above the lower water level of the river in the gorge below. It carries a road, railway and footway. The bridge is the only rail link between Zambia and Zimbabwe, and one of only three road links between the two countries. The other road links are at Chirundu Bridge and Kariba Dam.
The Victoria Falls Bridge did not bring the first train or the first railway to Zambia. In order build the railway north as fast as possible, Cecil Rhodes wanted the Livingstone to Kalomo line built before the bridge was finished. A locomotive was carried in pieces across the gorge by the temporary electronic cableway used to carry the bridge materials. The cableway was called the 'Blondin' by the bridge engineers. The locomotive was put back together and started work months before the bridge was complete. 
For more than 50 years the bridge was used by passenger trains as part of the main route between the then Northern Rhodesia, southern Africa and Europe. Freight trains carried mainly copper ore (later, copper ingots) and timber out of Zambia, and coal into the country.
The age of the bridge and maintenance problems have led to traffic restrictions at times. Trains cross at less than walking pace and trucks were limited to loads of 30 tons. Bigger trucks have to take the longer road using the Kazungula Ferry or Chirundu Bridge. The limit was raised after repairs in 2006. The bridge needs to be extensively rebuilt or replaced. 
During the Rhodesian UDI crisis and Bush War the bridge was often closed (and regular passenger services have not been successful). In 1975, the bridge was the site of unsuccessful peace talks when the parties met in a train carriage above the gorge for nine and a half hours. In 1980 freight and road services restarted and have continued without interruption except for maintenance.
Today one of the Victoria Falls Bridge's main attraction are historical guided tours about the construction of the bridge and which include a walking tour under the main deck. On the Zambian side there is a small museum about the bridge which is free to enter and contains cafe selling refreshments.
Also located on the bridge is the Shearwater bungee jump including a bungee swing and zip-line. Concerns about safety of the attraction were raised in late 2011 after the bungee's cord snapped and a young Australian woman fell into the fast flowing river with many crocodiles.
The bridge was originally called the Great Zambesi or Zambezi bridge, later becoming known as the Victoria Falls Bridge.

Bailey bridge

The Bailey bridge is a factory made truss bridge. It was made in small sections that could be easily moved and put together on site. It was developed by the British during World War II for military use. 
A Bailey bridge did not need special tools or heavy equipment to put into place. The wood and steel bridge parts were small and light enough to be carried in trucks and lifted into place by hand. The bridges were strong enough to carry tanks. Bailey bridges continue to be used in building projects and to provide temporary crossings for people and vehicles. 
It was designed by a British engineer, Donald Bailey. The British army tested different bridge designs in 1941â1942, including a suspension bridge and a stepped arch bridge. The flat truss bridge was the most successful. An early test model of the Bailey flat truss bridge is still in place over Mother Siller's Channel in Dorset. The Bailey bridge was first used by the army in Tobruk in 1942. The US Army built many of the bridges for use after the D-Day landings in France.
The basic Bailey bridge is made up of three main parts, the "floor", the "stringers" and the side "panels". The floor of the bridge is made up of a number of that run across the bridge. Across the bottom of these, forming a square, are . The bridge's strength is provided by the panels on the sides. The panels are , , cross-braced rectangles. Each weighs , and can be lifted by six men.
The transoms rest on the lower part of the panels, and are held together by clamps. The stringers are placed on top of the completed structural frame, and large pieces of wood are placed on top of the stringers to provide a roadbed. Ribands bolt the planking to the stringers. Later in the war, the wood was covered by steel plates, to protect it from the damage caused by tank tracks.
Each unit built in this way is a single section of bridge, with a roadbed. After one section is complete it is pushed forward over rollers on the bridgehead, and another section built behind it. The two are then connected together with pins pounded into holes in the corners of the panels.
Bailey bridges are in regular use throughout the world. Some examples include:
The Skylark launch tower at Woomera was built up of Bailey bridge parts.

Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links

A should not have many pages linking to it. These pages are . They are there to clarify and help readers in cases where there are two or more topics with a similar name. For example, if two or more famous people have the same name, a disambiguation page helps the reader find the article they want. Ideally, should not link to disambiguation pages, except when the ambiguity (many meanings) of a term is being described. Instead, links should go directly to the right article. Where an article links to a disambiguation page on purpose, that link should be through a Foo (disambiguation) redirect, to make it clear that the link is on purpose. Links from namespaces other than articles are allowed, but still may need to be disambiguated. to disambiguation pages are not considered to be within the article namespace for purposes of this guideline.
Several automated tools can be used to make disambiguation easier. The English Wikipedia also has to help you fix links more efficiently. All of the following tools work on Simple Wikipedia:

Bleeding

Bleeding, technically known as haemorrhaging (Brit.) or hemorrhaging (US) is the loss of blood or blood escape from the circulatory system. 
Bleeding can occur internally, where blood leaks from blood vessels inside the body, or externally, either through a natural opening such as the vagina, mouth, nose, ear or anus, or through a break in the skin.
Desanguination is a major blood loss. Exsanguination is losing enough blood to cause death. A person does not have to lose all of their blood to die. People can die from losing half to two-thirds of their blood.
Typically, a healthy person can endure a loss of 10â15% of the total blood volume without serious medical difficulties, and blood donation typically takes 8â10% of the donor's blood volume.

Rumpelstiltskin

"Rumpelstiltskin" () is a fairy tale. It was first published by the Brothers Grimm in their "Children's and Household Tales" of 1812. There are many similar tales such as "Tom-Tit-Tot". Maria Tatar points out that the Rumpelstiltskin plot hinges on greed and deception, and has little moral value for children. 
A poor miller tells the king that his daughter can spin straw into gold. The king locks her in a castle room to test her. She cries because the task is impossible. A little man appears. He spins the straw into gold. He takes a trinket in payment. The king is delighted. He does not know the girl has had supernatural help. He tests the girl again the next night. Once more, the little man does the task and receives a trinket. On the third night, the girl promises to give the little man her first-born child in payment for again spinning the straw into gold. The king marries the girl. She gives birth to a child. The little man comes to claim the child. He gives the queen the chance to keep her baby if she can guess his name. A courtier spies on the little man and learns his name is Rumpelstiltskin. The queen confronts the little man with his name. He rages and tears himself in two.

Edward Thorndike

Edward Lee "Ted" Thorndike (August 31, 1874 â August 9, 1949) was an American psychologist. He spent most of entire career at Teachers College, Columbia University. He worked on ethology and the learning process. This led to the theory of connectionism, and helped lay the scientific foundation for modern educational psychology. 
Thorndike also worked on industrial problems, such as employee exams and testing. He was a member of the board of the Psychological Corporation, and served as president of the American Psychological Association in 1912.
The law of effect basically states that âresponses that produce a satisfying effect in a particular situation become more likely to occur again in that situation, and responses that produce a discomforting effect become less likely to occur again in that situationâ.
Thorndike's textbooks were widely used in psychology courses for teacher training in the first part of the twentieth century.

Nasty Party

The term Nasty Party was first used by Theresa May where in October 2002 she described the Conservative Party of the United Kingdom as "There's a lot we need to do in this party of ours. Our base is too narrow and so, occasionally, are our sympathies. You know what some people call us -- the Nasty Party."
The term "Nasty Party" applied to Conservative Party members with traditional conservative stances which included being anti-gay, anti-minorities, and pro-business, and lacking concern for the poor.
Many conservatives felt this one the reasons the Conservative Party lost the last three general elections and needed to broaden their traditional base to have a chance of reelection.

Pas de Quatre is a romantic ballet with music by Cesare Pugni and choreography by Jules Perrot. It premiered at Her Majesty's Theatre in London on 12 July 1845. The critics raved. The ballet was created for the four great ballerinas of the age: Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi, Fanny Cerrito, and Lucile Grahn. The ballet was given four performances. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attended the third performance.
It was thought that the four great ballerinas would never consent to appear on stage together. They were very jealous and extremely competitive. It was only through the tactful persistence of Benjamn Lumley, the manager of the theatre that the ballet was realized. Fanny Essler was one of the great ballerinas of the age, but not invited to participate because she was Taglioni's greatest rival. She had threatened to dance Taglioni's signature piece "La Sylphide".

Don Ho

Donald Tai Loy "Don" Ho (; August 13, 1930 â April 14, 2007) was a Hawaiian musician, singer and actor.
Ho is of Chinese, Hawaiian, Portuguese, Dutch, and German descent. He was born in the small Honolulu neighborhood of Kakaako. Ho grew up in KÄneohe on island of Oahu. He was a graduate of the Kamehameha Schools in 1949. He attended Springfield College on a football scholarship in 1950. Ho left Springfield and returned home to earn a bachelor's degree in sociology at University of Hawai'i in 1953. In 1954, Ho entered the United States Air Force. He did his basic training at Keesler AFB, Mississippi. Ho spent time flying fighter jets in both Texas and Hawaii. When he was sent to Hamilton AFB, California, he went to the local town of Concord and bought an electronic keyboard from a music store. He was known to say, "That's when it all started."
Don married the girl he was in love with in high school, Melvamay Kolokea Wong, on November 21, 1951. She was the mother to the first six of his children. Ho was married for 48 years until she died on June 8, 1999. While in the military, Ho lived in many states with his family until he was called home to help his mother Honey Ho, with the family bar business called Honey's.
Ho left the United States Air Force in 1959 due to his mother's illness. He began singing at his mother's club in Kaneohe. Honey's became a main location for the local entertainment. Many of their customers were from the Kaneohe Marine Base.. Ho always honored the military. He remembered his own years of military service. In 1963, he moved the club in KÄneohe to WaikÄ«kÄ«. After much success, Kimo Wilder McVay wanted Don to play at a night club called "Duke's". It was owned by Duke Kahanamoku. This was where he was noticed by record company officials.
Ho was first signed to Reprise Records. He released his first album, "Don Ho Show", in 1965. Ho began to play places in Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe, and New York City. In 1966, he released his second album. It was a live album called "Don Ho â Again!". This album charted in the early part of that year. In the fall of 1966, Ho released his most famous song, "Tiny Bubbles". The song charted on both the pop (#8 Billboard) and easy listening charts. The "Tiny Bubbles" LP was in the album Top 20 for almost a year.
Ho had many guest appearances on television series. These included "I Dream of Jeannie", "The Brady Bunch", "Sanford and Son", "Batman", "Charlie's Angels", and "Fantasy Island". Although his album sales peaked in the late 1960s, he was able to get a television series on ABC from October 1976 to March 1977. It was called the "Don Ho Show". It was a variety program and was broadcast on weekday mornings. 
Ho had ten children. His children often worked with him either. They either performed with him or were a part of the business part of his performances. He loved to work with his children. He taught them the entertainment business. His daughter, Hoku, performed with her father in his WaikÄ«kÄ« show. In 2000, she went on to become a well known singer. In 2005, he sang a song that was used as the opening theme to the direct-to-video and DVD movie "Aloha, Scooby-Doo!".
In 1995 at the age of 65, Ho's health began to get bad. He had a small stroke. By 2002, he had a heart condition that could not be fixed. He was always hopeful no matter how bad his health was. He always felt there was a way to fix things. He also kept singing ever night.
Ho was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in 2005. He had a pacemaker implanted. He talked with a biotechnology company that dealt with treating heart conditions with adult stem cells. This company was working with Dr. Shoa, cardiac surgeon and one of the first people to work with adult stem cells for heart disease. On December 6, 2005, Ho had his own stem cells put into his heart by Amit Patel and his other doctors in Thailand. The treatment went without problems. Later in the month, Ho said, "I'm feeling much better and I'm so happy I came up here to do it."
Around September 12, 2006, Ho married Haumea Hebenstreit. She worked on his show in WaikÄ«kÄ«. A few days later Ho went into cardiac arrest. He had had a new pacemaker installed on September 16, 2006, but still died in WaikÄ«kÄ« from heart failure on April 14, 2007.

Miniature horses are not ponies they are actually mini horses because they have the features of a horse (i.e. longer legs and they are not as chubby as ponies).

Alveolo-palatal consonant

In phonetics, alveolo-palatal (or alveopalatal) consonants are palatalized postalveolar sounds. They are usually fricatives and affricates. We pronounce them with the blade of the tongue behind the alveolar ridge, and the body of the tongue raised toward the palate. These consonants are similar to palato-alveolar consonants, but alveolo-palatal consonants are more fully palatalized.
We often use the alveolo-palatal sibilants in the Chinese languages (e.g.Mandarin, Hakka, and Wu), and other languages in the East Asian sprachbund (e.g.Japanese and Korean). Many slavic languages (e.g.Polish, Russian and Serbo-Croatian) also contains alveolo-palatal sibilants. Northwest Caucasian languages (e.g. Abkhaz and Ubykh) also use this consonant. Kinnauri uses an alveolo-palatal nasal. The alveolo-palatal consonants in the International Phonetic Alphabet are: 
The sinological circles sometimes use (), (), and () for alveolo-palatal plosives, nasals and liquids. But the IPA does not accept these symbols. We sometimes use these symbol to represent simple palatal or platalized consonants. 
We consider the Polish nasal (represented with the letter "Å") to be alveolo-palatal, but not palatal. And the "palatal" consonants of several Indigenous Australian languages are also sometimes judged closer to alveolo-palatal in their articulation.

Hello, If I can, I would like to be granted admin status. I have been on this project since about late December '05, and I have cumulated a bit over 1600 edits on simple (usually about 20 a day, a bit over 2 edits per page).Editcount on Interiot"s tool. On de, en, and la I have also a few, but I really focused on this project.I currently have a job, and edits happen in my free moments. I am also interesed in quality edits, rather than quantity. 
I know that this must look pale compared to Freshstart , who's candidature I fully support. -- 12:43, 14 March 2006 (UTC)
I do not claim to be faultless. In the recent months I have tried to bring down the number of edits per page (exactly because of those 'broken links' issues,previewing also helps there). I started out at almost 3 edits per page, today I am slightly above 2. I am a professional computer scientist, and have done professional software development in several languages (eg. Java, C) as well as done things in "web-frontend" languages like PHP. Btw: Where those errors affect the syntax, I am sure there are tools that will tell me."
Typos are human, yes. To expect other editors (note that the Wikipedia software didn't complain about either broken link--it took the review of a human) seems like 'make-work' for other editors. 
I don't have a problem with 'typos'--we all make them. I DO have a problem with a consistent pattern of zero percent policing one's edits to avoid the most basic errors, creating extra work others. I have no idea where the "Also he thinks that relying on the computer in those areas that the computer is good at" comes from. The Wikipedia computer/software more than happily accepted Eptalon's broken links (check two versions before--it was only followup human editors (not just me) that detected and fixed Eptalon's errors. Computers will NEVER be as able to detect software errors as humans can.--scroll to the bottom. 07:30, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

After being here for a few months, I feel that I have learned and more fully understand the finer points of Simple Wikipedia; therefore, I humbly request to be a sysop for Simple Wikipedia. I am an avid vandal fighter on English Wikipedia, English Wiktionary, and here at Simple Wikipedia. I am a member of the Counter Vandalism Unit. I am a channel staffer at #vandalism-simple-wp, #vandalism-en-wt (the Wiktionary vandalism channel), and #vandalism-meta (the Meta vandalism channel). For the full picture, I am an op in #vandalism-en-wp (the WP channel). In addition to CVU bots, I frequently watch for vandalism with CDVF.
I know that my edit count is relatively low compared to other new admins, but one should note that many of my edits have been speedy deleted after I have posted speedy tags on articles. In addition, I feel I should mention that I am an admin on English Wikipedia and English Wiktionary. Also, I have already served as an admin on Simple Wikipedia in a temporary capacity twice. I offer my logs as testament to my judgement as an admin. I feel that admin rights would assist me in the course of my work and help me to better serve the community.
I completely understand if the community feels that I should be here longer for applying for powers, but I strive to assist the wiki-community. Therefore, I offer myself to you for your consideration. -- 23:58, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

I would like to candidate myself to sysop status because, I spent about 18 hours in wikipedia, My favourite work is patrolling...my VF is always open with the recent changes of simple.wikipedia, if we look on my edit we fount a good number a rollback.
Sometimes when I fight with vandals I never found an admin to help me. I'm a sysop on italian wikipedia, but I believe in this "simple" project. Now there are (13) pages in request in Category:Deletion requests but anyone delete them...
We have 6,010 users...and 7(0.15%) active sysops...it's a small number.
Thanks anyone for supports and not supports -- 18:02, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

Mining (military)

Mining, landmining or undermining is a way of attacking a walled city, fortress or castle during a siege. It has been used since before the Middle Ages. During the Middle Ages, "mines" or "tunnels" were dug underneath castles to let soldiers into the castle or to destroy the walls. Mining was used during World War I to try and break the stalemate of trench warfare. Soldiers tunneled under no man's land and put of explosives beneath the enemy's trench. On 7 June 1914, as part of the Battle of Messines, the Allies set off hundreds of tonnes of high explosive in 19 mines at the same time. About 10,000 German troops were killed.

I know I've only been contributing heavily for the last nineteen days, and I saw people on saying their minimums are three months and 1000 edits so I know my chances of this succeeding are pretty slim at this point, but this wiki doesn't have many active administrators and I'm active a lot so I'd be able to help out quite a bit. I'm an administrator on English Wikipedia, so I know about how everything works. I'm pretty good with English Wikipedia's policies, and I've read a bit of the stuff here too. Because of how active I am, I'd be able to deal with quick deletions and vandals quickly.
I'm not actually expecting this to pass, and if it doesn't, I'll understand; it seems unlikely that the community would be able to trust a user enough in less than a month to give them the administrator tools. But I'm giving it a shot, so here goes. 22:45, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

The Substitute

"The Substitute" is the seventh episode of the second season of the American television series "Glee". It was the 29th episode of the entire series. The episode was directed by Ryan Murphy and written by Ian Brennan. It was first broadcast on FOX on November 16, 2010. The episode was watched by 11.70 million people in the United States. It was the top scripted show among adults aged 18â49 for the week it was broadcast. The episode guest stars Gwyneth Paltrow as Holly Holliday. She is a substitute teacher who does Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) job as glee club director while he is sick. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) becomes principal of William McKingley High School, and glee club members Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) and Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) start to feel stress in their growing friendship.
The episode includes cover versions of six songs. These songs got mixed reviews from music and television journalists. The cover version of Cee Lo Green's "Forget You" and mash-up of "Singin' in the Rain" with Rihanna's "Umbrella" was given good reviews. Both covers' charted on the "Billboard" Hot 100. Paltrow's guest appearance was given positive reviews. The sub-plots of the episode did not get good reviews. Aly Semigran of MTV, Robert Canning of IGN and "Entertainment Weekly"s Tim Stack all thought that "The Substitute" is the best episode of the season. "Time"s James Poniewozik said that the episode was an "okay" episode. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said it was better than the previous two episodes. The National Alliance on Mental Illness gave positive reviews for the episode's definition of bipolar disorder. Paltrow won the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for "Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series" for her acting.
Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) is given the job of being the principal of William McKinley High School. She was given the job after causing Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) to be infected with the flu. Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) also gets the flu. He takes time off from work to get better. He is cared for by his ex-wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig). This leads to them sleeping together.
Glee club co-captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) tries to take over for Will. This results in problems. At the request of Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), club lessons are taught by substitute teacher Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow). She has different ways of doing things. These include talking about Lindsay Lohan's rehabilitation in Spanish, singing "Conjunction Junction" to her English class, and pretending to be a bipolar Mary Todd Lincoln for the History class. When Holly first goes to glee club rehearsal, she does a cover of Cee Lo Green's "Forget You". The group likes her performance. Rachel is annoyed. She is worried that Holly may not be able to get them ready for the Sectionals competition. Holly later wins over Rachel by "duetting" with her on "Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag" from the musical "Chicago".
Kurt rejects his best friend Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) in favor of his new friend Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss). Mercedes does not like it when Kurt tries to set her up on a date with a football player because they are both black. She also feels left out when she comes with Kurt and Blaine to dinner. This is because the conversation is mostly about gay issues and icons. When Sue starts a healthy eating program and says people can not eat "Potater Tots", Mercedes starts a student protest. She also puts Tots in the tailpipe of Sue's car. This causes $17,000 worth of damage.
Sue's program becomes popular with the students' parents. Her job as principal is made permanent, and she fires Will. Will is later visited by Holly who is looking for help. Holly does not think she is doing a good job as a teacher. She thinks this because she caused Mercedes to act the way she did. She tells him that, at first, she took her work seriously. She changed when a student (Lindsay Sims-Lewis) hit her in the face. Because of being hit, she chose to be more laid-back. Terri arrives while they are talking. She gets mad because Holly is there. Will asks Terri to leave. He tells her her that their "reunion" was a mistake and he ends their relationship.
Kurt confronts Mercedes. He tells her that she may be substituting food for love and their friendship for a romantic relationship. Mercedes decides to talk to the student who Kurt tried to set her up with. As she leaves, school bully Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) approaches Kurt. He tells Kurt that he will kill him if Kurt tells people that he is gay. At the request of the glee club members, Sue makes Will the director again. He suggests a group performance of "Singin' in the Rain". Will asks Holly to help them make it modern. They end up with a mash-up with Rihanna's "Umbrella" song.
"The Substitute" is Paltrow's first ever scripted-show guest performance. The role of Holly was created for her by show creator Ryan Murphy. Murphy suggested that she show her vocal and dancing talent before the December 2010 release of the movie "Country Strong". In this movie, Paltrow plays a country singer. In September 2010, BBC News said that she would be in two more episodes of "Glee". E! Online's Kristen dos Santos said that Holly would become a love interest for Will in the episode. Murphy later said that Holly's appearance would create a "love quadrangle" between herself, Will, guidance counselor (a counselor and an educator who helps students with problems they are dealing with in school by giving positive advice.) Emma Phillsbury (Jayma Mays) and her boyfriend Carl Howell (John Stamos). Fancast later said that Paltrow's guest appearance had been shorten to a single episode. They also said that neither Mays and Stamos were in "The Substitute". After the episode was done filming, Murphy stated that both he and Paltrow hoped that she would appear on "Glee" again in the future. This would depend on a storyline that best fit with her character Holly. In December 2010, Paltrow said that she would return to the series for another episode. A month later, Murphy said she would be on the series again as a sex education teacher. Paltrow won the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for "Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series" for her work in "The Substitute".
"The Substitute" includes a short "fantasy" moment. In it, Will sees the club members as kindergarten-aged children. Child actors were used to act out as the characters' younger selves. These included Jake Vaughn and Lauren Boles as young Finn and Rachel. The episode also includes the return of Gilsig. Gilsig had not been in several episodes of "Glee". Gilsig believed that Will's sickness let viewers see the couple in a positive relationship for the first time. She also thought that the addition of Holly "highlighted" a special bonding in their relationship. She said that while Terri is not "the most pleasant person", she is at least faithful to Will, while he has "a wandering eye" (has interest in another women) and treats Terri badly in "The Substitute". The main characters in this episode include glee club members Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) and Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), Principal Figgins, school bully Dave Karofsky, cheerleader Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter), wrestler Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink) and Kurt's friend Blaine Anderson.
"The Substitute" includes cover versions of six songs. Paltrow performs on four of these. She recorded them all in one day. The songs she recorded were "Conjunction Junction" from Schoolhouse Rock!, and a clean version of Cee Lo Green's "Fuck You!" entitled "Forget You". The producers of the series had wanted Paltrow to sing a Coldplay song. They chose to not do this. They wanted to use the song for a competition episode of "Glee". Morrison and Shum, Jr. sang a duet version of "Make 'Em Laugh" from the musical "Singin' in the Rain". Paltrow and Michele did a duet on "Nowadays / Hot Honey Rag" from the musical "Chicago". Morrison and Paltrow performed a mash-up of "Singin' in the Rain" with "Umbrella" by Rihanna featuring Jay-Z. The cast had to spend twelve hours filming for the mash-up in a tank of water.
All of the songs performed except "Conjunction Junction" were released as digital download singles. "Forget You" is featured on the soundtrack album "Glee: The Music, Volume 4" (2011). "Forget You" and "Singing in the Rain / Umbrella" charted both on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and internationally. "Forget You" peaked at number eleven in the US and number twelve in Canada. "Singing in the Rain / Umbrella" peaked at number ten in Ireland. Green's "Fuck You!" entered the top ten of the Hot 100 for the first time after the Glee cover. His sales increased 94% in a week.
When "The Substitute" was first broadcast on FOX, it was watched by 11.70Â million US viewers. It had a 5.0/14 Neilsen rating/share in the 18-49 demographic group. This helped the episode to become the top-rated program of the night for adults aged 18â49. In the weekly rankings, the episode was the top scripted program for adults 18-49. Overall, it placed twentieth for the second season. Views and ratings were both better than the previous episode, "Never Been Kissed". It was watched by 10.99Â million viewers and had a 4.6/13 rating/share. In Canada, viewership was also better than the last episode. It was watched by 2.29Â million viewers and ranked ninth for the week. The last episode had 1.97Â million viewers and ranked twelfth. In Australia, the episode was watched by 1.06Â million viewers. This made "Glee" the seventh most-watched program of the night and nineteenth of the week. In the UK, the episode was watched by 2.55Â million viewers-2.11 million on E4, and 439,000 on E4+1. It was the most-watched show on cable for that week.
The music performances got mixed feedback from music and television journalist. Anthony Benigno of the "Daily News" gave "Conjunction Junction" an "A". He had noticed the "ordinarily" (in a normal way) of the song. Benigno did not give a review for the song because of its short length. He only said "what a glorious ten seconds it is". Benigno and Poniewozik criticized "Forget You" for not having any profanity that was in the original recording. Poniewozik liked Paltrow's "deeper voice". He gave her cover a "A". Benigno liked the original version better. "Rolling Stone"s Erica Futterman believed the "clean version" of the song did not affect its success. She said that it was "charming and sassy". Megan Vick of "Billboard" called it "the most exciting number (song)" of the episode. Stack gave the song an "A+". He also said it was "one of the most memorable and energetic "Glee" performance(s) ever, thank in no small part to Paltrow". Green told MTV that we was "flattered" by the cover, mostly because he did not know Paltrow would perform it after he was allowed to be in the audience watching the episode filming. He called her performance "great". He also said that he did not know that she could sing.
Benigno and Stack gave a good review for the choreography of "Make 'Em Laugh". They gave it a "B" and "B+". These were lower grades than they gave "Forget You". Vick said that "Glee" covers songs from musicals to often introduce classic songs to viewers in a more modern way. He felt that "Make 'Em Laugh" did not do this. The "Chicago" cover did not get a positive review from many critics. Futterman, "The Wall Street Journal"s Raymund Flandez and "The Atlantic"s Patrick Burns all believed the choreography was "lacking". Kevin Fallon said that "Glee" should not be "overusing recreations". He said that they had done this in other episodes. These included "The Power of Madonna", "Britney/Brittany" and "The Rocky Horror Glee Show". Todd VanDerWerff of the "A.V. Club" said he did not like the performances. He said they were "outright plagiarism", not an homage (in respect)" to the original artist.
For the song "Singin' in the Rain/ Umbrella", Benigno and Futterman compared the songs as a better mash-up than the previous episode's mash-up. Benigno gave the cover a "B". He said that by using "Singin' in the Rain" as the chorus, the song lacked "catharsis". This was also seen by Flandez. He gave positive reviews on the costumes, props and staging, but had hoped that the cover had more "bite" and "attitude". Futterman said it was a "buoyant (cheerful) and catchy homage to the old and the new [that] perfectly captures "Glee"s musical spirit". Vick felt the song could not compare to the previous episode's mash-ups. She believed the staging was "implausible" (not believable). Stack wrote that he loved the mash-up. He gave it an "A-". Amy Reiter of the "Los Angeles Times" liked the choreography.

Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden

The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden is a zoo in the American city of Cincinnati, Ohio. It claims to be the second oldest zoo in the United States because it opened 14 months after the Philadelphia Zoo.
The zoo has over of land and about 2,800 animals. It has over 30 indoor and outdoor attractions. The Cincinnati Zoo also breeds rare animals. For example, it was the first zoo to breed the California sea lion and one of the first to breed the American bison both in 1878. It is the only place in the Western Hemisphere where one, two, and three Sumatran Rhinoceroses have been born.
The Cincinnati Zoo started in 1875. It covered 66 acres and was owned by some of the richest men in Cincinnati. There are currently around 500 species at the zoo with a total of around 1900 animals. There are also over 6,000 plant species shown at the zoo. The zoo is home to Indian blue peafowls that are free to walk anywhere around the zoo.
In the late 2000s, the Cincinnati Zoo was named the Greenest Zoo in America for their "go green" practices. The zoo currently has ten special garden exhibits and has over 5,000 other plant species spread throughout the zoo. In early 2010, the zoo completed their construction of over 6,000 solar canopies in the main parking lot. This is the largest display of solar panels in the world. The zoo also displays plants in the animal exhibit in which they are the correct biome for that species. For example, there are many Florida native marsh plants and shrubs in Manatee Springs; bamboo gardens in the red panda exhibits; and bushes from California in the sea lion exhibit.
Since 1989, Wildlife Canyon has been showcasing rare and exotic hoofstock species that are native to many parts of the world. It currently consists of six different paddocks along the bottom of a steep canyon that was built in 1942. Visitors may walk among emus, camels, Asian wild horses, Sichuan takins, river hogs and the critically endangered Sumatran rhinoceros. Every Sumatran rhino that lives in the U.S. was born at the Cincinnati Zoo.
At this attraction that opened in 1970, guests can walk into large flight cages that are home to two of some of the largest flying birds on the planet, condors and sea eagles. When visitors enter the two flight cages while being in an elevated observation deck, there is nothing that comes between the visitors and the birds. The Cincinnati Zoo is currently the only institution in North America to breed the Steller's sea eagle. Efforts to set these species free have been successful multiple times. Two eagle chicks can be seen nesting in the sea eagle flight.
This island is a man-made rock surrounded by a moat and exotic landscaping and provides a home for to a large troop of snow monkeys or Japanese macaques. It is over 80 years old and was one of the first bar-less monkey exhibits in North America.
Gorilla World attempts to simulate the rainforest of central Africa. It opened in 1978 as one of the first, natural gorilla exhibits in the country. The main enclosure is about a 30,000 square foot, forest habitat with many tropical plants, waterfalls, meadows, logs and vines for zoo's famous Lowland gorillas to encounter. The zoo also holds the record for having the most gorilla births in one year; six, in 1996. There are also exhibits for colobus monkeys and crowned guenons.
This whole area are is a series of eight enclosures housing a variety of African species of the Savannah, and Asian species of the forest. The rhino reserve opened in 1997.
Jungle Trails takes visitors through a 2.5 acre naturalized rain forest habitat, teeming with rare and exotic wildlife and hundreds of plant species from Asia and Africa. Each region in the exhibit is divided by outdoor and indoor habitats with enjoyable viewing of the Zoo's collection of rare primates such as Bornean orangutans, bonobos, MÃ¼eller's and lar gibbons, bamboo, ruffed, and sifaka lemurs, Angolan colobus monkeys, aye-ayes, Francois langurs, lion-tailed macaques, pottos, pygmy slow lorises, and greater galagos that brachiate, crawl, and jump from branch to branch. In addition, Jungle Trails houses some of the zoo's birds, reptiles, insects, and other rare mammals that include lesser adjutant and saddle-billed storks, pelicans, white-naped ravens, yellow-billed hornbills, starlings, shelducks, hammerkops, cloud rats, sugar gliders, large-spotted genets, emperor scorpions, and ground boas. The attraction received the AZA prestigious exhibit award in 1994, a year after it opened. Two baby galagos and three baby large-spotted genets can be seen in the African Building.
The main animals in the area are the zoo's two polar bears, a male named Little One, and a female, Berit. Visitors can watch the bears swim in their one large 70,000 gallon pool that stretches between the two enclosures. There are many observation areas available for the guests, including underwater viewing, across from a moat, and even of the bears on land only with 3 inches of glass separating them from the visitors. Next to the bears is an aviary that houses a bald eagle.
The Bear Hill grottoes were built in 1937 featuring two bear species from North and South America, black bears and Andean bears. The exhibits were built on a hillside to complete their natural mountainous habitats to also keep the sun from shining light into their exhibits.
In Lorikeet Landing, a flight cage built in 1962 and renovated in 2006, is a mesh enclosed aviary filled with hundreds of birds native to Australia and New Guinea.
Guests can hike through the Wolf Woods to see animals native to North America. The area opened in 2005 after a renovation of Otter Creek.
Opened in the 1950s and renovated in 1985, and 2008, the Children's Zoo is an attraction for children and young animals. The zoo's nursery features baby animals that come and go from different zoos. The young animals have the opportunity to come out of their exhibit, and walk around the zoo while being guided by keepers. The play area designed for children contains small habitats for threes species of armadillos (three-banded, six-banded, screaming hairy), and three species of tortoises (gopher, red-footed, radiated).
Children may enter the Petting Zoo and feed and interact with dwarf goats and doll sheep. Blakely's Barn, that was added in 1997, has both indoor and outdoor paddocks with close viewings of four-horned sheep, cattle, llamas, dwarf goats, miniature cows, miniature donkeys, and alpacas. At the entrance of the attraction is Penguin Walkabout that opened in 1985. Little and black-footed penguins live here.
This attraction features rare and endangered apes that can be viewed brachiating on two large jungle gyms built on two circular islands that were constructed in 1972. Guests can walk on a wooden platform that is on the surface of the lake to get an even closer look of the zoo's loudest animals, siamangs and buff-cheeked gibbons, as they can be heard from every part of the park.
Some of the zoo's current red pandas were given to the zoo in 1985 from the Beijing Zoo. They live in two exhibits at the zoo that teems with natural plants of China. The Zoo has bred over 70 red pandas, the last one being in the early 2000s.
The exhibit Elephant Reserve, opened in 2008 after the renovation of Vanishing Giants, in an area that has been exhibiting elephants and other pachyderms since the zoo's opening in 1875. The main feature of the exhibit is a 1.5 acre female habitat showcasing the zoo's stars, Schottzie, Mai-Thai, and Jati. The exhibit includes a 60,000 gallon pool that is next to one of the many viewing areas. Sabu, the bull, has his own habitat that was added in the year 2006.
Swan Lake is the largest body of water at the zoo, giving a home to native waterfowl of Cincinnati. Many species like mallards, pintails, and swans are free to inhabit the lake as they please as the historic train also circles around them. Along the end of the lake is "Crane Island", home to a Japanese species called red-crowned cranes. "Wetland Trails" is an area, giving an all natural, naturally enclosed habitat to a sandhill crane.
The Reptile House is America's oldest existing zoo building. Visitors can see a variety of monitors, pythons, mambas, tortoises, and even frogs and salamanders behind glass. There is an open-topped exhibit in the center of the building where alligators and sliders co-exist.
This includes an eagle owl, vampire bats, and giant fruit bats. There are cat species like endangered Pallas' cats, clouded leopards, Brazilian ocelots, black-footed cats, sand cats, a caracal, fishing cats, and bobcats. There are dog and cat like species like fossas, aardwolves, palm civets, bearcats, tayras, bat-eared, and fennec foxes. Here also lives rare primates like pottos, and greater bushbabies. Aardvarks and a Burmese python are also displayed
World of the Insect, or the Insectarium has the widest collection of six-legged species:
Monitor lizards from the smallest to the longest, and the largest in the world. Guests may observe dwarf, green, quince, and crocodile monitors. In the largest enclosure of the complex lives the star of the attraction Hudo, a Komodo dragon. Each indoor exhibit is glass-enclosed and are full of real plant life and branches. Outdoor viewing for the Komodo dragon is available near the exit of the building.
Built in 1999, based on the Everglades, Manatee Springs houses many different species of wildlife from the swamps of Florida. The first section of the building is a greenhouse that simulates the sights and sounds of a freshwater swamp, tropical hammock and coastal wetland mangrove wetlands. American alligators, American crocodiles, and Florida cooter turtles can be observed in a series of water/land exhibits all with an underwater viewing. This includes a bridge constructed over a deep pool where zoo visitors may walk on as an alligator snapping turtle lies directly beneath it.
Over 50 species of birds, and displays that provide habitats as natural as the outdoors. Birds from the Amazon all the way to the Antarctic Coast are displayed. Guests can see owls, macaws, bird-of-paradises, hornbills, parakeets, auklets, puffins and even three species of penguins. Seeing opportunities for zoo visitors as such include two walk-though aviaries, open-fronted habitats, and species behind glass with underwater viewings.
Discovery Forest is a 4,500-square-foot tropical rainforest in a unique, two-story circular atrium. The setting is a tropical Latin American rainforest, incorporating interpretive elements from throughout Central and South America. In 2008, several neotropical animals like a two-toed sloth, a blue-and-gold macaw, and boa constrictors were added to emphasize the relationship between plants and animals.
Africa will be the largest animal exhibit in the Zoo's history, planned to be nearly 8-acres big and at a cost of $32,000,000. In Phase IV, the zoo will add the largest part of the future attraction, a wide Savannah teeming with some of Africa's most spectacular hoofstock such as zebras, gazelles, and elands. Along with some of the world's largest birds like ostriches, Marabou storks and grey-crowned cranes. This phase will be open in 2014.
The final phase will bring Nile hippos and crocodiles. The hippo area will give visitors a view above and below-water. In addition, this phase will include Nile crocodiles and possibly African wild dogs. This last area will open in 2015.

Provinces of Greece

The provinces of Greece were divisions of some the country's prefectures. In 1887 the provinces were endeed as administrative units. They were still used for some state services, especially finance services and education, as well as for electoral purposes. Before the Second World War, there were 139 provinces. After the war, with the addition of the Dodecanese Islands, their number grew to 147. The largest province is Dodoni

<doc id="334995" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=334995" title="Eggshell">
Eggshell

An eggshell is the outer covering of a hard-shelled egg and of some forms of eggs with soft outer coats. It is a main character of the cleidoic egg, which allows amniotes to breed on land.
Amniotes developed the cleidoic egg early in the Carboniferous period, and this meant they could live and reproduce on dry land. These early land animals evolved into the reptiles, birds and mammals of today. In contrast, the amphibia are land animals who must lay their eggs in water, because the eggs are not protected by a shell. 
The structure and composition of the eggshell protects the egg against damage, microbial contamination, and desiccation (drying out). Small molecules can pass through it, so the shell allows gas exchange for the growing embryo. It also provides calcium for the embryo's skeleton. 
While many reptiles lay eggs with flexible, calcified, eggshells, there are some that lay hard eggs. Eggs laid by snakes generally have leathery shells which often adhere to one another. Depending on the species, turtles and tortoises lay hard or soft eggs. Several species lay eggs which are nearly the same as bird eggs.
The normal bird egg is a fertilized egg sitting on the yolk surface and surrounded by albumen, or egg white. The albumen in turn is surrounded by two shell membranes (inner and outer membranes) and then the eggshell. The chicken eggshell is 95-97% calcium carbonate crystals, which are held together by a protein matrix. 
While the bulk of eggshell is made of calcium carbonate, it is now thought that the protein matrix has an important role to play in eggshell strength. These proteins affect crystallization, which in turn affects the eggshell structure. 
The average laying hen, takes about 20 hours to make the shell. Pigmentation is added to the shell by papillae lining the oviduct, coloring it any of a variety of colors and patterns depending on the species.

Pacheco, California

Pacheco is a census-designated place (CDP) in Contra Costa County, California, United States. At the 2010 census, 3,685 people lived there. Pacheco is north of Walnut Creek.
According to the United States Census Bureau, Pacheco has a total area of .
The town was started in 1857. There was a post office there from 1859 to 1913. In 1955, postal service started again.
For a short time, Pacheco had a lot of very successful businesses. During that time, ships from the Pacific Ocean were able to get to the town by going through Pacheco Slough. Then, during the 1860s, there were some fires, floods, and an earthquake. These destroyed the town and filled the slough with silt so that ships could not get there any more. Many people later left Pacheco to go to the nearby town of Todos Santos, which was later renamed to Concord.
In January 2011, the Martinez City Council voted to take over the parts of Pacheco that are north of California State Route 4. The government was expected to approve the takeover in the fall of 2011. In March 2012, enough people objected that an election would have to be held about the issue.

Bombyliidae

The Bombyliidae are a family of flies. Their common name is bee flies. 
The Bombyliidae are a large family of flies. It has hundreds of genera, but the life cycles of most species are known poorly, or not at all. Some are very small (2Â mm in length), but some can be very large for flies (wingspan of some 40Â mm). 
Adults normally feed on nectar and pollen. Those with a spectacularly long proboscis are adapted to plants (such as "Lapeirousia") which have long, narrow floral tubes. 
The Bombyliidae include a large number of species, but for its size this is one of the least understood families of insects. There at least 4,500 described species, and certainly thousands still to be described. The adult flies usually feed on nectar and pollen, and some are important pollinators.
Many Bombyliidae look like bees and so a common name for the family is the bee flies. The reason is probably aposematic: the adults are safer from predators because they share the warning colours of bees. The adult females usually lay eggs near the nests of possible hosts, often in the burrows of solitary bees, wasps or beetles. 
The larval stages are predators or parasitoids of the eggs and larvae of other insects. The eggs hatch into larvae which eat the eggs and larvae of the 'host' insect. Although most bee-flies usually are fairly or highly host-specific, some species do attack a number of hosts.

Phototropism

Phototropism is growth in the direction of light. Phototropism is common in plants, but can also occur in other organisms such as fungi. The cells on the plant that are farthest from the light have a plant growth hormone called auxin, which causes phototropism to occur. It causes the plant to have elongated cells on the farthest side from the light.
Phototropism is one of the many plant tropisms or movements which respond to external stimuli. Growth towards a light source is a "positive phototropism", while growth away from light is called "negative phototropism". Most plant shoots have positive phototropism. Roots usually have negative phototropism, though gravitropism may play a larger role in root behavior and growth. Some vine shoot tips exhibit negative phototropism, which allows them to grow towards dark, solid objects and climb them.
Auxin collects mainly on the darker side of the stem and stimulates cell elongation. Thus, the cells on the side not directly exposed to light will grow faster than the opposing side, and the stem will curve towards the light source. 
Phototropism in plants such as "Arabidopsis thaliana" is directed by blue light receptors called phototropins. Other photosensitive receptors in plants include phytochromes that sense red light, and cryptochromes that sense blue light.

Pastygate is the name given to a political scandal in the United Kingdom in March 2012. The government had said that it was going to place a 20% VAT charge on hot pasties.
A Labour Member of Parliament asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Conservative MP George Osborne, about when he last ate a Cornish pasty. Osborne answered that he had no idea when he had last eaten one. This answer has been used to show how out of touch with ordinary people the Conservative party had become. The Prime Minister David Cameron later said that he had recently eaten a Cornish pasty at Leeds railway station "and that it was very good". However, The Sun newspaper then reported that there was no place to buy Cornish pasties at Leeds railway station at the time David Cameron claimed to have eaten one there. 
The issue, which at first appeared to be unimportant, was then taken up by several other newspapers and political commentators. They pointed out that the Conservatives seemed not to know that the pasty was a basic food eaten by many ordinary people in the country. The VAT rise on the pasty would affect both these customers and the pasty industry itself. These newspapers and commentators made fun of David Cameron's attempt to show himself as a regular pasty eater (i.e. as one of the people) and that George Osborne's did not know what a pasty was.

Axiom of choice

In mathematics the axiom of choice, sometimes called AC, is an axiom used in set theory. 
The axiom of choice says that if you have a set of objects and you separate the set into smaller sets, each containing at least one object, it is possible to take one object out of each of these smaller sets and make a new set. You do not always need to use the axiom of choice to do this. You do not need to use the axiom of choice if the starting set is finite, or if the starting set is infinite and has a rule built in for how it can be divided. For example, for any (infinite or finite) sets of pairs of shoes, one can pick out the left shoe from each pair, but for an infinite collection of pairs of socks, the axiom of choice is needed.

Her modesty and piousness are described by many contemporary historians.
Her Sufi position was accepted by the poet Ali Haider who previously believed that "a woman can't become Sufi".
She was born in Jarala (a place in present Punjab, Pakistan). According to tradition, she was of Arab descent, her grandfather being one Abu'il'Fateh, who was an Arab merchant and a Qadiri Sufi by denomination. In her childhood, she got formal religious education in Islam and also learnt three languages, Punjabi, Persian and Arabic. In addition, she also obtained spiritual-mystical training.
At the time of her birth, the Punjab was under the Mughal Empire. But after the death of Nader Shah, Ahmad Shah Durrani the Afghan in 1747 became the Padshah (King) and most of the area was ceded to him along with Sindh by the weak Mughals, in order to save themselves from Afghan attack. This was the foundation of the Afghan Durrani Empire which remained in power from 1747 until 1826. This period also coincided with much of her life, by and large. After that the Punjab came under the Sikh Empire (1799â1849) and was later annexed to British India in March 1849.
She was supposedly married to one Khawaja Noor Muhammad and had two children by him. Whilst living a normal domestic life, she also practiced her ascetic beliefs and was very pious and devoted to prayer. In time, it is claimed she performed several miracles and attained to a high degree of faith. After her demise, her family and various locals set up a small shrine over her grave where people would come to pray and ask for assistance >. After her demise she was titled 'Rabia Zaman' by people, indicating that she was the 'Rabia of the Age' (after the earlier Arabic Sufi saint Rabia Basri).
She had two children Saleh Muhammad Safoori (son), Saleha (daughter).
The descendents of Saleh Muhammad Safoori are still living in same area where she was born, lived and died.

These include a Writers Guild of America Award nomination and a Golden Globe Award nomination for "Best Television Series Drama". It has won one Emmy Award. The series has also had very good Nielsen ratings. The rating for the series have set many records for a cable series. For example, 9 million people watched its season two finale (last episode of the season). This made it the most-watched basic cable drama telecast in history.
"The Walking Dead" is based on the comic book series of the same name. It tells the story of a small group of people living in a zombie apocalypse. Most of the story takes place in the near Atlanta, Georgia. The group looks for safe place which is not near the very large groups of deadly zombies. The zombies are called "walkers" in the series. Walkers will eat any living thing they can catch. They also infect anything they bite. The first episode deals mainly with the problems the group have as they try to keep their humanity and still survive.
The group is led by Rick Grimes. He was a sheriff's deputy before the zombies. The group must always deal with the horror and danger of the walkers. They must also deal with changes in their group as new people join them and others are killed.
Season one is about Rick Grimes as he tries to find his family and take them to safety. The series starts with Rick waking up from a coma. He awakes to a world overrun with the walking dead ("walkers"). Rick leaves the hospital. He goes to his home and learns that his wife and son are not there. Rick hears a rumour from a fellow survivor. He goes to the police station and gets weapons. He goes to Atlanta. He was told that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention created a "safe-zone" in the city. He thinks this is where his family would have gone. During his travel, Rick sees the damage to both society and infrastructure caused by the disaster. When he gets to Atlanta, he sees that the city is overrun by the undead. It is no longer a safe zone.
A few miles outside the city, Rick's wife Lori and son Carl have been hiding from the walkers with Shane Walsh. Shane was a deputy who worked with Rick. He was also his best friend. Shane and Lori are in a camp with a small group of survivors. Rick meets Glenn in the city. Glenn helps him leave Atlanta and takes him to the camp where he finds Lori and Carl. Rick takes command of the group with Shane. Part of the group goes back into Atlanta to get weapons. While there, they have a conflict with other survivors. When the group returns to their camp, they find that many walkers are now there. One of their group is injured and needs medical treatment. The group chooses to go back to Atlanta and try to get help from the CDC.
Only one person is left in the CDC. This person is Dr. Edwin Jenner. Everyone else has either left or killed themselves. Dr. Jenner tells the group that his research into the infection has not led to a cure. The CDC building is not the safe place the group thought it would be. The next day, the safety protocols are started when there is not enough fuel for the generators. An explosion will destroy the CDC. The explosion is to stop the escape of any deadly diseases in the CDC. Dr. Jenner tells the group that the French may have found a cure. He thinks this is possible since they survived the longest in their labs. Dr. Jenner choses to stay in the CDC and die in the explosion. A member of the group, Andrea, tries to stay as well. Her sister Amy had just died and Andrea did not want to live anymore. Dale stays with her. He tells her that if she does not leave, he will not leave also. To stop him from dying, Andrea choses to leave with the group. Before the group leaves, Dr. Jenner whispers something into Rick's ear. The group leave just as the CDC explodes.
The second season starts with Rick and his group leaving the CDC. They think that they should go to Fort Benning. While going there, they find that I-85 is blocked by many empty vehicles. The group searches some of the vehicles and takes things that could be useful. While they are searching, a very large group of walkers moves along the road towards them. They have to hide under the vehicles so the walkers do not see them. Sophia is seen by a walker and runs into the woods to get away from it. After the walkers leave, the group starts to look for Sophia. During the search, Carl is shot by a man hunting a deer. Otis, the man who shot Carl, takes Rick and Shane to a large farm. The farm is owned by a veterinarian named Hershel Greene. Hershel removes the bullet from Carl. The group go to the farm while Carl heals. Secrets and issues about who should lead the group causes problems. During this time, many relationships are dealt with and the group continues to look for Sophia. Glenn starts a romantic relationship with one of Hershel's daughters, Maggie. He learns that Hershel's barn is full of walkers. Some of these are HershelÂ´s family members. Hershel thinks they are just sick and could be cured someday. When Shane lets the walkers out of the barn and the group shoots them all. After the last of the walkers is killed, one last walker leaves the barn. It is Sophia. She is then shot by Rick.
Hershel tells Rick and his group that they have to leave his farm. Rick and Glenn go looking for Hershel. They find him in a local tavern. He is drinking large amounts of alcohol. After trying to get Hershel to go back to the farm, two other men enter the bar. They are with another group of survivors. This meeting does not go well and both men are killed in a gunfight. Other members of the group the dead men were with come looking for them. They find Rick, Hershel, and Glenn at the bar and begin shooting at them. The noise of the guns attracts a large group of walkers. While trying to get away from the walkers, the other group leaves one of their group, Randal, behind. Rick does not want to leave Randal to be killed by walkers. He cover his eyes and take him to the farm. Once they get him to the farm, they think that he could lead the rest of his group to the farm. Rick wants to drive Randall far away and set him free. While He and Shane are doing this, they are attacked by walkers when Rick and Shane get into a fight. Before the walkers attacked, Randall tells Rick and Shane that he knew Maggie. He knows where the farm is at. Rick thinks the location of the farm should be a secret to keep them safe. Since Randal knows where it is, they take him back to the farm until they know what to do with him. Rick and Shane talk about the fact that they will probably have to kill Randal. Back at the farm, Hershel's daughter Beth tries to kill herself. Seeing so many people in her family die, she does not want to live in this world anymore. The group talks about what to do with Randall. Only Dale thinks they should not kill him. While they are talking about Randal, Carl takes a gun from Daryl's motorcycle and goes into the woods. He sees a walker with its legs trapped in mud. Rather than shooting it, he starts throwing rocks at it. After a while, the walker gets free of the mud but Carl runs away. Later that night, the Rick and Shane go to kill Randal. As they are doing this, Carl enters the barn and tells Rick to shoot him. This causes Rick to stop and try to find a different way to deal with the problem. Soon after this, Dale is badly injured by a walker and will die soon. It is the same walker that Carl ran from earlier. Dale is then shot in the head by Daryl. This ends his suffering and stops him from coming back as a walker. Shane goes to the building where they are keeping Randal. He sets him free and takes him into the woods. Shane tells Randal he want to leave Rick's group and join Randal's group. Instead of this, Shane leads Randal from the farm and kills him by breaking his neck. The group sees that Randal is gone and starts to look for him. Shane goes back to the camp and tells them that Randal had gotten free, attacked him and taken his gun. Daryl, Glenn, Rick and Shane go looking for him. They separate into two groups. Daryl and Glenn are one group, Rick and Shane are the other. Daryl and Glenn find Randall. He has become a walker. They look at his body and see that he was never bitten. They understand that the dead can come back without being bitten. Shane uses the search for Randall to try to kill Rick. His plan does not work and Rick kills Shane. Just minutes later, Shane turns into a walker and stands up. Carl shoots him.
A very large number of walkers in the woods hear the noise caused by Carl's gun. They all start to walk in that direction. Rick and Carl run to the barn. Rick tells Carl to set the barn on fire after the walkers come inside. Rick and Carl leave the barn from an upper level while the walkers burn. With walkers all over the farm, a large battle takes place. Jimmy and Patricia are killed and Andrea is left behind. The rest drive away from the farm. Andrea runs into the woods. She is chased by many walkers. She kills many of them and is later rescued by a hooded woman. This woman, Michonne, is carrying a sword to kill walkers. She also has two walkers with her. These two walkers have had both of their arms and their lower jaws cut off. Michonne leads the armless walkers around with chains around their necks. The survivors all meet back on the highway where they lost Sophia. They drive off but must soon make camp when Rick's vehicle has no more fuel. Rick tells them that "this isn't a democracy any more" after he tells them what Dr. Jenner told him. Jenner told him that all of the survivors are infected. A large prison is shown in the be background as the episode ends.
The group have been on the road for months and Lori is far into her pregnancy. Rick finds a prison which was seen in the final scene in season 2. They decide to go to the prison and stay there. They kill the walkers outside and then go inside to kill some more. Hershel gets bitten in the leg and Rick has to cut it off. The group meet prisoners who had been in the prison's cafeteria for months. The prisoners had no idea what had been going on in the world since the outbreak started and Rick tells them about it. Some of the prisoners try to kill members of the group and so Rick kills Tomas and leaves Andrew to die while Oscar and Axel are put in another block away from the group. Andrew is still alive and rings an alarm which brings walkers to the prison. A huge battle happens. T-Dog is killed by walkers trying to protect Carol. Lori is about to give birth to her baby as this is happening. Maggie cuts her open to take the baby out but Lori dies. Carl is then forced to shoot his mother in the head. Rick finds Andrew and is nearly killed when Oscar shoots Andrew, killing him and saving Rick. After the attack, Maggie and Carl bring the baby to Rick. Rick finds out Lori died and starts crying.
After Lori has died, Rick starts to see visions of her. At the same time, Andrea and Michonne are found by Merle, who is Daryl's brother. Merle takes them to a town called Woodbury. The leader of Woodbury is a man who everyone calls The Governor. Michonne doesn't trust Woodbury and goes to the prison where Rick is. At the prison, Michonne meets Rick and his group. Glenn and Maggie are captured by Woodbury, so Michonne takes Rick's group to Woodbury to save them. In the battle, people on both sides die, but the prison group finds a way to escape. The Governor says to Woodbury that Rick and his group are terrorists.
Daryl reunites with his brother Merle after the battle and chooses to leave Rick's group with Merle. He changes his mind later and goes back to the prison group. Rick goes to his hometown to get weapons, and thinks about his morals when he sees Morgan again. Andrea convinces The Governor to speak to Rick and make an agreement for peace; secretly, The Governor plans an attack, and Merle risks his life to stop the attack. Andrea runs away from Woodbury but is caught by The Governor. He locks her in a room with a walker and attacks the prison. They are stopped by Rick's group, and The Governor kills his own people for not fighting. The Governor escapes, and Rick's group returns to Woodbury to bring in the survivors but are too late to save Andrea.
Several months later, the prison community has gotten bigger. Many people in the prison get sick with the flu at once. The flu kills many people who come back as walkers. Rick sends Carol away for murdering two sick residents. Walkers attack the prison fence and break it but are stopped afterwards. The Governor meets the Chambler family, and they join another group of survivors led byÂ Martinez, who was in Woodbury before. The Governor kills Martinez and takes lead the group to attack the prison. Rick offers to share the prison, but The Governor calls Rick a liar and kills Hershel. The Governor fights Rick and is killed by Michonne, but the prison is taken over by walkers and Rick's group is divided.
Separated into small groups, the survivors see signs along railway lines that say that there is a safe place at Terminus. Glenn andÂ Tara ChamblerÂ join a group of people including Eugene PorterÂ â who says he knows how to stop the walkers if he can get to to Washington, D.C. They meet up with Maggie and are the first to get to Terminus. Carol helps two sisters she taught to use weapons in secret. After one of them kills the other, Carol kills the living sister.Â Beth GreeneÂ is taken away from Daryl by unknown people. Daryl meets and joins a gang that later say they want to kill Rick. Daryl helps Rick, and Carl and Michonne to defeat them. Then they reach Terminus. They are welcomed by the residents of Terminus first, but are forced to give up their weapons and locked inside a railway boxcar.
Rick's group find out that the residents of Terminus eat other people. Carol uses walkers to attack Terminus so the others can escape. Reunited, they soon encounterÂ GarethÂ and a small group of Terminus survivors who try to eat Rick's group but are defeated.Â Abraham FordÂ andÂ Rosita EspinosaÂ continue their mission to get Eugene to Washington, D.C., joined by Glenn, Maggie and Tara. After facing a number of problems, Eugene says that he made up the story about a cure in order to get protection. Daryl and Carol follow a marked car to Atlanta, where Beth has been kept in a nearby hospital ruled by untrustworthy police officers. Carol is taken, and Daryl gets the rest of his group to help. They capture police officers to make a trade but a brief standoff ends with Beth killed.
The reunited group continue toward Washington, D.C. and meetÂ AaronÂ who offers them shelter at the Alexandria Safe Zone, a community led byÂ Deanna Monroe. Feeling the sheltered residents can't survive against walkers or other survivors, Rick and Carol discuss taking over the community while others begin to take leadership roles. A series of problems scare residents, and during a meeting deciding Rick's fate he kills a resident who accidentally killed Deanna's husband. Rick's friend Morgan arrives to see the execution.

Neurolinguistic programming

Neurolinguistic programming is a way of communicating, created in the 1970s. It is often shortened to "NLP". The discipline assumes there is a link between neurological processes, language and behavior. According to NLP, it is possible to achieve certain goals in life by changing one's behaviour. 
Certain neuroscientists psychologists and linguists, believe that NLP is unsupported by current scientific evidence and that it uses incorrect and misleading terms and concepts.
NLP was invented by Richard Bandler and John Grinder. According to these people, NLP can help solve problems such as phobias, depression, habit disorder, psychosomatic illnesses, and learning disorders.
Reviews of empirical research on NLP show that NLP contains many factual errors. It did not produce reliable results for the claims for effectiveness made by NLPâ developers and proponents. According to Devilly, NLP is no longer as common as it was in the 1970s and 1980s. Criticisms go beyond the lack of empirical evidence for effectiveness; critics say that NLP has pseudoscientific characteristics, title, concepts and terminology. One example where NLP is used as pseudoscience is to make the teaching of scientific literacy at the professional and university level easier. NLP also appears on peer reviewed expert-consensus based lists of discredited interventions. In research designed to identify the âquack factorâ in modern mental health practice, Norcross "et al." (2006) list NLP as possibly or probably discredited, and in papers reviewing discredited interventions for substance and alcohol abuse, Norcross "et al." (2010) list NLP in the top ten most discredited, and Glasner-Edwards and Rawson (2010) list NLP as âcertainly discreditedâ.

Orion (mythology)

In Greek mythology, Orion is a giant hunter. When he goes hunting, his dogs Sirius and Procycon accompany him. He lived in Boeotia and Crete. People do not agree about his parents: Sometimes he is said to be the son of Poseidon and the gorgon Euryale, at other times, he is said to have three fathers, Poseidon, Zeus and either Hermes or Ares. All three mixed their perm in a bag of animal hide. Zeus gave him his craving for erotic adventures, from Poseidon, he got the ability to walk on water.
He is married to Side, but Hera cast his wife into the Tartaros, because Side was too proud of her own beauty.
In Greek literature he first appears as a great hunter in Homer's epic the "Odyssey", where Odysseus sees his shade in the underworld. The bare bones of his story are told by the Hellenistic and Roman collectors of myths, but there is no literary version of his adventures. Other heroes' stories are told, for example Jason in Apollonius of Rhodes' "Argonautica" or Euripides' "Medea". The entry in Ovid's "Fasti" for May 11 is a poem on the birth of Orion, but that is one version of a single story. The surviving fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about Greek prehistory and myth.
Orion served several roles in ancient Greek culture. The story of the adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one on which we have the most evidence (and even on that not very much); he is also the personification of the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a hero, in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one etiological passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the Straits of Sicily.

<doc id="335528" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=335528" title="Paquita">
Paquita

Paquita is a romantic ballet in two acts and three scenes. Its story was written by Joseph Mazilier and Paul Foucher. The music was composed by Edouard Deldevez. It was originally choreographed by Joseph Mazilier. "Paquita" was first performed in the Salle Le Peletier by the Paris Opera Ballet on 1 April 1846. It starred Carlotta Grisi and Lucien Petipa. "Paquita" remained in the repertory of the OpÃ©ra until 1851. 
The story takes place in Spain during the occupation of Napoleon's army. The heroine is the young Gypsy girl, Paquita. She is really of noble birth. She was abducted by Gypsies when she was an infant. She saves the life of a young French officer, Lucien d'Hervilly. He is the target of a Spanish governor who desires to have him killed by IÃ±igo, a Gypsy chief. Paquita discovers that she is of noble birth. She is in fact the cousin of Lucien. She and Lucien marry.
In 1847, "Paquita" was staged for the first time in Russia for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg by Marius Petipa and Pierre-FrÃ©dÃ©ric Malevergne. It was Petipa's first ballet staged in Russia. In 1881, Petipa produced a revival of the ballet. He added new pieces specially composed by Ludwig Minkus. This included the "Pas de trois" (aka the Minkus Pas de trois or Paquita Pas de trois) for the first act, and the Paquita "Grand pas classique" and the "Mazurka des enfants" (Children's mazurka) for the last act. Petipa's version of "Paquita" remained in the repertory of the Mariinsky Theatre until 1926.
Marius Petipa's 1881 additions for "Paquita" survived long after the full-length ballet left the stage. Today these pieces, particularly the "Grand pas classique", are major cornerstones of the traditional classical ballet repertory. They have been staged by ballet companies throughout the world.
In 2001, the Ballet Master Pierre Lacotte produced a revival of the full-length, two act "Paquita" for the Paris Opera Ballet. Although Lacotte re-choreographed most of the ballet himself, he restored Joseph Mazilier's original mime sequences and mise-en-scÃ¨ne, as well as Marius Petipa's 1881 additions.

Speed skating

Speed skating "or" speedskating is when in ice skating, people race against each other. Everyone will travel the same distance. They usually compete around an oval course. The Dutch were arguably the earliest pioneers of skating. They began 
using canals to maintain communication by skating from village to 
village as far back as the 13th century. Skating eventually spread 
across the channel to England, and soon the first clubs and artificial 
rinks began to form. Passionate skaters included several kings of England, Marie Antoinette, Napoleon III and German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. 
Speed skating appeared for the first time in 1924 at the first Olympic Winter Games in Chamonix. Initially, only men were allowed to 
participate. It was only at the Lake Placid Games in 1932 that women 
were authorised to compete in speed skating, which was then only a 
demonstration sport. It was not until the 1960 Games in Squaw Valley that womenâs speed skating was officially included in the Olympic programme. 
The events almost always follow the European system, which consists 
of skaters competing two-by-two. At the 1932 Olympic Games, the Americans organised American-style events, i.e. with a mass start. This decision brought about a boycott by many European competitors, which allowed the Americans to win the four gold medals. This system would give birth to short-track speed skating, which was added to the Olympic programme in Albertville in 1992. The first known skating competition is thought to have been held in the Netherlands in 1676. However, the first official speed skating events were not held until 1863 in Oslo, Norway. In 1889, the Netherlands hosted the first World Championships, bringing together Dutch, Russian, American and English teams.

Ann Martin grew up in Princeton, New Jersey with her parents and her younger sister, Jane. She graduated from Smith College. After this, Martin became a teacher and then an editor of children's books. Now, she is a full-time writer.
Martin finds the ideas for her books from many different things. Some are based on what she has done herself. Others are based on childhood memories and feelings. All of the characters that Ann uses in her books, including the members of "The Baby-Sitters Club", are fictional. However, many of her characters are based on real people. Sometimes Ann names her characters after people she knows, and other times she simply chooses names that she likes. 
In 1990, she started the Ann M. Martin Foundation. This gives money to causes which help children, education/literacy programs, homeless people and animals.

Magical thinking

Magical thinking is a kind of thinking that looks for relationships between actions and events that can not be proved by reason and observation. Examples of magical thinking include some forms of prayer, some religious or magical rituals, superstitions, and taboos. The rain dance is a form of magical thinking. The dancers believe that the actions and songs used in the rain dance will cause rain to fall. Faith healing is a form of magical thinking where the healer says prayers, puts their hands on the sick person in the belief that the healer's actions will cure the person. Explanations for magical thinking include coincidence, the placebo effect, self-deception, staged events, and natural causes. See materialism. 
In psychology, magical thinking may lead people to believe that their thoughts by themselves can cause effects in the world or that thinking something is the same as doing it. It is a type of incorrect reasoning that looks for meaningful relationships between coincidences. 
However many people believe supernatural things do happen sometimes. To believe all explainable events are simply due to magical thinking is a form of scepticism.

"The song hugely objectifies women and excuses rape culture,â Hollie OâConnor, president of the University of Derby Studentsâ Union, told NBC News. âIt is a man suggesting that there are âblurred linesâ when it comes to sexual consent and that is unacceptable. We felt we needed to take a stand.â Numerous parodies of the video were released online. Thicke responded to criticism by calling it 'ridiculous'. He said the lyrics are about "blurring the lines between men and women and how much we're the same" and "blurred lines between a good girl and a bad girl."

ÂÂIn August the song was performed at the MTV Video Music Awards with Miley Cyrus. The performance was the most Tweeted-about event in history. Thicke also performed Give It 2 U with Kendrick Lamar and 2 Chainz.

Assembly line

An assembly line is a manufacturing process which is a very important part of industry.
In an assembly line, parts are added to a product in a sequence. Each worker and machine does one part, and the parts are put together to make the finished object. This makes a product much faster than with handcrafting-type methods, where one person made the whole object. 
The division of labour was discussed by Adam Smith in his book "The Wealth of Nations" (1776). He used the manufacture of pins as an example.
The assembly line developed by Ford Motor Company between 1908 and 1915 made assembly lines famous as an example of mass production. The result was a cheaper car, the Ford Model T, and higher wages for Ford workers. Henry Ford was the first to master the moving assembly line, and was able to reduce labor hours needed to make a car, and increased numbers of cars and parts. Ford was the first company to build large factories around the assembly line concept. 
Mass production by assembly lines was the catalyst which started the modern consumer culture by making possible low unit cost for manufactured goods. It is often said that Ford's production system was ingenious because it turned Ford's own workers into new customers. The lower prices turned a huge potential market into a reality. The greater demand allowed further economies of scale to be exploited. This bootstrapping quality of growth made Ford famous and set an example for other industries.
The idea was not invented by Ford. Its use in America may have started with the production of cars by Ransom E. Olds in 1901.
The earliest example of an assembly system is the Terracotta Army of the 3rd century BC. The terracotta army figures were made in workshops. The head, arms, legs and torsos were created separately and then assembled. Studies show that eight face moulds were most likely used. Once put together, features such as facial expressions were added. 
It is thought their legs were made the same way that terracotta drainage pipes were made at the time. This would make it an assembly line production, with specific parts manufactured and assembled after being fired, as opposed to crafting one solid piece and subsequently firing it. In those times, each workshop had to write its name on items produced.

Charnia

Charnia is the genus name of a frond-like Ediacaran lifeform. It has segmented ridges branching alternately to the right and left from a midline. The genus "Charnia" was named after Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire, England, where the first fossilised specimen was found.
"Charnia" is a highly significant fossil for several reasons. It is the first fossil ever described from undoubted Precambrian rocks. Until then the Precambrian was thought to have no fossils. Similar fossils found in the 1930s (Namibia) and the 1940s (Australia) but were thought to be of Cambrian age. 
Secondly, "Charnia" has become an enduring image of Precambrian animals. Originally interpreted as an alga (Ford), it was recast as a sea pen, a sister group to the modern soft corals, from 1966 onwards (Glaessner). The sea pen interpretation has recently been discredited. The current "state of the art" is something of a "statement of ignorance".
Little is known of the ecology of "Charnia". It was benthic, anchored to the sea floor. It probably lived in deep waters, below the waves (perhaps a great deal below the wave base). This means it did not photosynthesise. Further, it has no obvious feeding apparatus (mouth, gut, etc.) and so its lifestyle is somewhat of an enigma. Some think it survived by filter feeding or directly absorbing nutrients. 
The growth and development of the Ediacara biota is also important. It was used to discredit the sea pen hypothesis. In contrast to the sea pens (that grow by new buds at the base), "Charnia" grew by new buds at the apex.
"Charnia" is, in time and geography, the most widespread Ediacaran fossil. The greatest abundance of specimens, which are also the oldest reliably dated Ediacaran fossils, are found at Mistaken Point on Newfoundland.
Three species, "C. masoni", "C. wardi", and "C. antecedens", have different length/width ratios and attachments of adjacent branches. 
"Charnia masoni" was found by Roger Mason, a schoolboy who later became a professor of metamorphic petrology, in 1957. Tina Negus, a 15 year old schoolgirl at the time, had seen this fossil a year previously, but her geography schoolteacher flatly denied the possibility of Precambrian fossils. 
"Charnia wardi", later discovered in 1978 in southeast Newfoundland, was first described in 2003. This is the longest surviving Ediacaran age fossil, lasting over 2 million years. The holotype is a fragmentary specimen with a "C. masoni" like structure. It was defined as a new species on the basis of long and narrow shape. 
"Charnia antecedens" has more irregular and higher angles of branching than "C. masoni".
A number of Ediacaran form taxa are thought to represent "Charnia" (or "Charniodiscus") at varying levels of decay.

A nursery is a school for children between the ages of one and five years. It is a pre-school education institution, part of a child's education.
A nursery in England is also called FS1, which is also first year of foundation before they go into primary school.
Nursery "kindergarten" (children's garden), is a name given by Friedrich FrÃ¶bel, who created the Nurseru in Germany, in 1837. Other common names are "pre-school", "playschool" and "playgroup". The German word Kindergarten is also used in many non-English-speaking countries to denote a form of pre-school education. However, in the United States, Canada, and some parts of Australia, "kindergarten" is instead the term used to describe the first year of compulsory schooling. The word "kindergarten" is not generally used in the UK.

Kingsway (London)

Kingsway is a major road in central London in the United Kingdom, designated as part of the A4200. It runs from High Holborn, at its north end in the London Borough of Camden, and meets Aldwych in the south in the City of Westminster at Bush House. It was built in the 1900s. Together Kingsway and Aldwych form one of the major north-south routes through central London linking the ancient east-west routes of High Holborn and Strand.
The road was built as part of a redevelopment of the area in the 1900s. Its route cleared away the maze of small streets in Holborn such as Little Queen Street and the surrounding dwellings. However Holy Trinity Church, which was built in Little Queen Street was spared. Whereas the Sardinian Embassy Chapel, an important Roman Catholic church attached to the Embassy of the Kingdom of Sardinia, was demolished to make way for the new street.
Plans were published by London County Council in 1898 and the road was formally opened in 1905. It is one of the broadest streets in central London at wide.
It was unique in containing below it a tunnel for a tramway, which started just north of Southampton Row, passed beneath Aldwych and continued to the Thames Embankment: this Kingsway tramway subway joined the North and South London tram systems. In 1958 the disused tunnel was reopened at the southern end to make a new connection, the Strand Underpass, for light traffic between Waterloo Bridge and Kingsway on order to reduce congestion. Also beneath Kingsway was a branch of the Piccadilly tube line from Holborn to Aldwych. It is now closed with no service but the platform at Holborn used for the branch is used for TV and film sets that require underground scenes. During WW2 the branch was used to store art treasures from the British Museum, including the Elgin Marbles.

Hello there,
this morining I extended System of linear equations, and also added links to common methods for solving such systems. While I know that solving such systems is an art to itself, I still noticed that we lack articles to most - if not all such methods. While some may only be applicable in certain cases, other methods are very imporant in mathematics, and should get their article here. I am thinking about Gaussian elimination, QR decomposition, Cramer's rule, and possibly Relaxation (iterative method). Look in the article to get a full list. I am laso not sure if the first two methods I described (replacing a variable by an expression only using other variables, and reducing the number of equations) have proper method names; if this is the case, these should probably be used, instead of the description. -- () 11:29, 24 March 2012 (UTC)
A discussion on the access page for AWB has brought up an issue. This would be the lack of interwiki links on many pages. According to the special page that tracks these pages we have 2373 pages without any interwiki links at all. This can lead to a lot of long hard hours hunting these links down. On the plus side, after an hour or two of poking and prodding, has emerged. This is the list of our pages here which do not have interwiki links but do have a page on the English wikipedia with the same name. In many of these cases, it is just a simple matter of copying the pagename to the interwiki link and the page will be fine. There are some problems (covered on the list) with redirects at en:wp and the lists is still over 1400 pages long but this would be little problem to anyone with en:wp AWB capability - grab the list, fire it up on en:wp, add our interwiki to the pages over there that are not redirects (easier than adding them here after looking that you are not linking to a redirect). The IW bots will do the rest and spread the information back here to our pages. Often the redirect there would even get you to the correct page to add the iw to but that page should be verified to not already hold a link back here to some other article (we do have a number of duplicates here that need to be merged). 
The other 900-ish pages are a bit more troublesome. Many may exist under different names, others will not exist at all. This is often the caase of pages deleted there or more obscure information here that they merged into a larger article and never created a redirect for that would have triggered the article to fall into the first 1400 page list.-- 07:00, 21 March 2012 (UTC)

While going through articles, it is easy to come across a stub that falls under multiple stub categories. For example, an American singer and actor. Three stubs could be used on this article. As the prevailing opinion is that putting all three on there is flooding the page too much (a bit cluttered and garish) the problem has always been how to chose which one. It generally ends up as personal choice at that moment. In some cases, the editor will just add a second stub and not worry about it. 
To get the best of both worlds, I tossed together . It allows from 2 to 6 stubs to be used on a page without the clutter. It only shows the first stub. It also knows that all of our stub templates (accept itself which should never be used with another stub) end in "-stub" so it includes that automatically. us-bio becomes us-bio-stub, music - music-stub. 
The appearance of the pages and what the users see would not change at all, but the page would be included in multiple stub tracking categories. This lets someone interested in working on specific stub types locate them more easily. Obviously, widespread use isn't practical as going through and re-stubbing all of our stubs to take advantage of this is not an option (and probably a bad idea to even attempt), but passive use of it by just adding it where there are already multiple stubs or when an editor is cleaning up an article or originally tagging it a stub and trying to chose which one would be best of the viable options they have... this could be handy to have available. 
An example of its use is on the Melissa Etheridge page (it had two stubs already). -- 08:48, 26 March 2012 (UTC)

We as a wiki are, in many cases, a second home to banned English Wikipedia users. We offer a second chance for users banned there to both contribute and show they are changing (although not an official "proving ground for good behavior"). As a group we have always been forgiving of past behavior. Opinions on this and its effects will always differ but that is the way things are. 
One issue about this position we take on the subject is NPOV / edit warring / battlegrounds. A number of our emigrated editors are serving a ban from the English wikipedia for conflicts on certain topics. They pushed their point, others fought back, hayhem ensued and they got a ban by ArbCom. While I think it is fine that we give them a chance to be productive, one huge problem remains. We normally do not have the personnel to prevent this from happening here. We don't have a horde of experts watching certain topics to notice one user from POV pushing. Our articles are completely open (for the most part) for users to spin many topics in whatever way they want. Many of these editors have already proven that they will spin them in the direction they feel is best. It is part of the reason they are banned and even after their ban is up, they are often still prohibited from ever editing on the subject. But they are free to come here and continue what is little more than a personal propaganda program on their topics of choice as we are not equipped to deal with it.
I propose that while we do not accept the en:ArbCom's rulings on banning, that we do, for the most part, follow their decisions on topic bans. The editors can still contribute, just not on topics they have proven they have issues with. Topics we, as a group, can not be expected monitor for continued POV pushing. A primary example of this is (en:user ) who had an extensive history of POV issues on boxing articles on En, came here and pushed the same agenda (and was only stopped when his "nemisis" from en: noticed and came here to correct his pov edits leading to even more drama that still ends up in my mailbox weekly years later.)
I feel it is better to lose an editor with a proven likelihood of POV and a small range of articles they are interested in editing than to allow them to have free reign and obscurely push their POV wherever they chose. It may be acceptable to allow them to edit these articles after someone steps up and offers to mentor/watch their edits on certain subjects, but free reign is too dangerous. 
We can not handle serial POV pushers. If they were bad enough for EN:wp to ban them for it, the least we can do is restrict their edition away from articles they have a prove issue with. -- 05:07, 4 April 2012 (UTC)
The headnote for the Point of view disambiguation page explains
A point of view which is informed and supported by inline citation support is good, solid, deserving encouragement. It is, in fact, not so much the point of view of the writer as it is the collective point of view of the serial sources which are cited. For example, it is not POV-pushing to mirror the scholarly consensus presented in the Library of Congress Country Studies, Japan (LOC).Do we not agree that this is what needs if the goal of our project is about building an online encyclopedia.IMO, Wikipedia is not primarily a game ... or is it? Creol's comments are "just what one person thinks". It is POV is informed by experience with our project, but its focus draws attention to the wrong thing. This thread mixes "apples and oranges".I am unwilling and unable to make guesses about what's worse -- the intended consequences or the unintended consequences which Creol has in mind. -- () 09:58, 4 April 2012 (UTC)

I'd like to transfer some articles from the main English Wikipedia to this one, but I'm unsure of some of the steps involved, and especially how to rewrite articles for this site. Stage 5 of "How to properly copy a page from another Wikipedia" says, "Don't save the new page yet, but go through the text and change words not in the combined wordlist to words that are in that list". This is the part I'm unsure about - I don't know which words are in the combined wordlist and which aren't. I have seen the page at Basic English combined wordlist, but it seems to give only a very short list of words, and I don't understand how one could use only those words to write an article.

Hello, 
I work with Clear Passage Physical Therapy, a network of physical therapy clinics treating chronic pain, infertility and bowel obstruction. I attempted to post information to pages relating to conditions we treat but the information was removed for the following reason: "We should be using secondary reviews, not primary studies." 
I understand that there are guidelines for the types of sources we can cite on Wikipedia, however the studies I was referencing are from recognized leaders in mainstream medical research â namely mainstream medical journals and the U.S. National Library of Medicine. These journals require independent peer-reviews by experts in the field. Several of the journals (Medscape General Medicine, Fertility and Sterility, Contemporary Ob/Gyn), are among the most respected journals in medicine. 
I'm not sure how to proceed -- I don't want to keep re-posting the information and have it taken down each time. Any help would be appreciated. 
Thanks very much!
Anna
Thank you, Gotanda! I can't seem to find a Help Forum for English wikipedia -- would it be possible for your to provide a link?

Hello.
I tried to upload an image of a music album cover here (under Fair Use), but apparently uploading images is prohibited in Simple English Wikipedia. I'm quite new to this wiki, but other languages haven't prohibited the upload of images. Could someone kindly clarify this for me? What do we do in cases of album covers, movie posters, cover art, etc.? How do we provide such visual identification?
Thank you. () 11:53, 20 May 2012 (UTC)

In my opinion, there are problems with some article titles in French. The suggestions at do not help me understand how to parse the issues. 
I first noticed a problem with the title of this article about a French Technicien supÃ©rieur de l'aviation? 
When I reviewed the history of the article's creator here, I found many carefully written articles with problematic non-English titles.
We understand that the proper names of institutions and airports may need to be non-English if there is no conventional English alternative. For example, 
I wonder if the French acronym is a better article title because it is simpler? I don't think so. () 20:00, 22 May 2012 (UTC) 
Is the French non-English proper name usually or always best? I don't think so. For example, 
In my opinion, Groupement des Ã©coles d'aÃ©ronautique (GEA) needs to be moved to French aviation school network or to the French acronym which is now a redirect page. What do you think? -- () 17:13, 22 May 2012 (UTC)
I'd like to see more of these in English as well. However, I think they're better in French than using acronyms. I don't think article titles should be acronyms. -- () 02:05, 23 May 2012 (UTC)
Technicien supÃ©rieur de l'aviation (TSA) needs to be moved to TSA (title) or TSA (job title). In my opinion, this article title should be the French acronym -- TSA -- because it is the closest English alternative. The French acronym will need disambiguation to distinguish it from the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA). What do you think? -- () 17:13, 22 May 2012 (UTC)
Technicien aÃ©ronautique d'exploitation (TAE) needs to be moved to TAE (title) or TAE (job title). What do you think? -- () 17:13, 22 May 2012 (UTC)

Hello everyone. I've decided to take the role of coordinator for this months Big Weekend. This month the focus is on "creation of vital articles" from . This is a good one because although you will be editing a "very" wide range of subjects you are maximising the benefit to Wikipedia by creating the most important articles. If this weekend is a success Simple English Wikipedia will take a sizeable step forward. The weekend is due to start on Friday 8 June until Sunday 10 June. When you edit please add the letters "BWR" to the edit summary to allow us to count the success of the weekend.

Hello! Have you been in the English Wikipedia in the last time? Did you go to somebody's user talkpage? Then you might have perceived a red heart icon. By clicking on this icon will open a JavaScript window, see the picture right. This extension is named "WikiLove", see for the topic.
Maybe you now recognised what this Extension does. It let's you adding messages to someone's talkpage, mostly barnstars. Specifically, it makes adding awards, gifts, and invitations to user talk pages as simple as clicking a few buttons. It is described like this: "WikiLove is a feature designed to make it easy and fun to express appreciation for other users. WikiLove can be invoked from any user page by clicking the "Heart" icon. It was originally developed by Ryan Kaldari as a user script, and is now available as a MediaWiki extension."
This extension is an official Wikimedia extension and is activated in the main English Wikipedia. You can find out more and . I suggest activating the extension here, hence the extension is written in English and the templates work together. Maybe simplification is needed but I'm sure that people here are willing to help. -- () 14:37, 11 June 2012 (UTC)
Sure, why not? It would certainly help with adding barnstars etc. to talk pages without having to copy-paste the code. - () 15:59, 11 June 2012 (UTC)
Oh god I hope we don't add this...its a nuisance on en.wiki and I would hate to see it migrate here. If you want to message someone a fuzzy message just use the talk page like normal. Once you automate the sending of a message like this (which this is essentially doing since all you have to do is click a few buttons) you lose the personal touch of the message. Which is sort of the point of sending such a message. Its the same reason we don't use welcome bots, who wants to be welcomed by an automated bot. It makes you feel less special because someone couldn't be bothered to take the effort to give you a real message. - () 12:05, 12 June 2012 (UTC)
That doesn't matter. I suggest to deactivate the feature by default. -- () 21:26, 12 June 2012 (UTC)
Please take a stand to discussion, I'm posting it here because I think that not many editors have the page on their watchlist. Cheers, () 13:49, 13 June 2012 (UTC)
I have a concern about a lot of the articles we have about individual movies. I've been reading , and it seems to me that a lot of the movie articles we have do not indicate notability. Many of the articles are little more than ""Movie X" is a 1990 American drama movie starring X and Y.", often with a link to the movie's IMDB entry. To me, this doesn't say notability. I know I can be quick to QD things, so I wanted to get some more discussion on this before I go QDing movie articles. Do we want looser notability criteria for movies than enwiki? For example, if a movie has one or more major movie stars in it, is that enough? Please let me know your thoughts. -- () 02:57, 14 June 2012 (UTC)

<doc id="336306" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336306" title="Box office">
Box office

A box office is a place where tickets are sold to the public. These tickets let people into a theater to see an event. In the movie industry, the term is most often used to mean the amount of money a movie makes by the selling of tickets. The term can also mean things which affect the amount a movie earns.
"Box office" business can be measured in terms of how many people see a movie. It can also be measured by how much money is earned by selling tickets. The estimate of these amounts and analysis of them is very important to the movie industry. It is often something that is important to fans as well. 
Some people think that the movie industry is concerned too much with this. They say profit is more important to movie studios than making movies as a form of art. Understanding how different types of movies earn money affects the how other movies are made and paid for. If a certain type of movie often has a large box office, studios are more likely to make that type of movie. Some types of movies earn more when they are released at certain times of the year. Studios use this information to plan when to release certain movies. For example:
There are many websites that show box-office number. Two of these are ShowBIZ Data and Box Office Mojo. 
Usually, the movie's distributor gets more than half of the money earned. The rest is kept by the movie theater. The percentage is different from movie to movie. The distributor often gets a higher percentage in early weeks. As time passes, the percentage become lower and the theater keeps a larger part of the ticket sales. With some movies, the distributor may take all of the ticket sales for the first week. The theater earns its money by selling food and drinks. After several weeks nearly all of the ticket sales is kept by the theater. Because of this, only the first few weeks are very important to the movie studios. 
The following is movie industry specific terminology. It is defined by Box Office Mojo.
For movies released in North America, box office figures are usually divided into two categories. The first is domestic. This is the amount a movie earns in the United States and Canada. The second is foreign which includes all other countries. The Weekly box office is the amount a movie makes from Friday through Thursday. The "movie week" starts on Friday because most movies are released on that day. A large part of this is the weekend box office. It is defined as the amount earned on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The first weekend after a movie is released is the opening weekend. The amount made by a movie on its opening weekend is what is often reported. 
Theaters is the number of theaters in which the movie is being shown. Because a theater may show a movie on more than one screens, the total number of screens is also used. If a movie is released in over 600 theaters, it is said to be wide release. If the number is less than 600, it is a limited release. A limited release may be as small as one theater or 1-2 theaters in New York City and Los Angeles, California. A movie may start with a limited release and later get a wide release. "Little Miss Sunshine" is an example of this.

Battersea Bridge

Battersea Bridge is a cast-iron and granite five-span cantilever bridge crossing the River Thames in London, England. It is on a sharp bend in the river, and links Battersea south of the river with Chelsea to the north. 
The first Battersea Bridge was a toll bridge. Although a stone bridge was planned, a cheaper wooden bridge was built instead. Designed by Henry Holland, it was opened to pedestrians in November 1771, and to vehicles in 1772. The bridge was poorly designed. Iy was dangerous to its users and to passing shipping. Boats often collided with it. To reduce the dangers to shipping, two piers were removed, and the sections of the bridge above them were strengthened with iron girders.
Although dangerous and unpopular, the bridge was the last surviving wooden bridge across the Thames in London. It was the subject of paintings by Turner, Cotman and Whistler.
In 1879 the bridge was taken into public ownership, and in 1885 demolished and replaced with the existing bridge, designed by Joseph Bazalgette. It is the narrowest surviving road bridge over the Thames in London, and one of London's least busy Thames bridges. The position on a bend in the river makes the bridge a hazard to shipping, and it has been closed many times due to collisions.
In June 2012, the bridge was highlighted on the route of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the Thames. The Battersea Bridge area marked the official start of the parade of ships and boats moving towards Tower Bridge.

<doc id="336412" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336412" title="Saint">
Saint

A saint is a holy person. In many religions, saints are people who are believed to be holy. 
In Christianity, the word "saint" refers to any person who is "in Christ", and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or in earth. Orthodox Christians and Catholics teach that all Christians in Heaven are saints, but some are worthy of more honor than others.
In the Christian Bible, only one person is actually called a saint: "They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD." () The apostle Paul called himself "less than the least of all saints" in .
Many religions use the "saint" idea to honor people, like Hindu saints. If a person is considered a saint, no matter what religion they belong to, they are usually:
In the Anglican Communion and the Continuing Anglican movement, a Saint is a person who has been elevated by popular opinion as a holy person. The saints are seen as models of holiness to be followed, and as a 'cloud of witnesses' that strengthen and encourage the believer during his or her spiritual journey (). Official Anglican policy recognizes the existence of the saints in heaven.
In the Eastern Orthodox Church a saint is defined as anyone who is in Heaven, whether recognized here on earth, or not. This means Adam and Eve, Moses, and the various prophets (except for the angels and archangels) are all given the title of "Saint". In the Orthodox Church, sainthood refers to closeness to God. 
In the Lutheran Church, all Christians, whether in heaven or on earth, are regarded as saints. However, the church still recognizes and honors certain saints, including some saints honored by the Catholic Church.
While Methodists as a whole do not practice the patronage or veneration of saints, they do honor and admire them. Methodists believe that all Christians are saints, but mostly use the term to refer to biblical people, Christian leaders, and martyrs of the faith. Many Methodist churches are named after saints, such as the Twelve Apostles, John Wesley, etc.
The beliefs within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) with regard to saints are close to the beliefs of the Protestant faith. In the New Testament the saints are all those who have been baptized. "Latter-day" refers to the doctrine that members are living in the "latter days", before the Second Coming of Christ. Therefore members are often referred to as "Latter-day Saints" or "LDS", and among themselves as "Saints".
The Syriac Orthodox, Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Ethiopian Orthodox, Eritrean Orthodox, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and Armenian Apostolic Church do accept the existence of saints, but officially recognize them in their own ways. For example, the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria canonizes saints, through the approval of that church's Holy Synod. A requirement of the Coptic Orthodox faith is that at least 50 years must pass from a saint's death to his canonization, and the Coptic Orthodox Pope must follow that rule.
There are some groups who do not accept the idea of the Communion of Saints. Some believe all of the departed are in soul sleep until the final resurrection on Judgment Day. Others believe that the departed go to either Paradise or Tartarus, to await the day in which the living and the dead are judged. Certain groups do not believe that the departed have any connection with the living.
In many Protestant churches, the word "saint" is used more generally to refer to anyone who is a Christian. This is similar to Paul's numerous references in the New Testament of the Bible. In this way, anyone who is within the Body of Christ (any Christian) is a 'saint' because of their relationship with Christ Jesus. Many Protestants consider prayers to the saints to be idolatry because they believe prayers should be given only to God himself. 
One Roman Catholic website says that "There are over 10,000 named saints and beatified people from history, the Roman Martyrology and Orthodox sources, but no definitive head count".
Rev. Alban Butler published "Lives of the Saints" in 1756, containing 1,486 saints. The latest edition of this work contains the lives of 2,565 saints. Monsignor Robert Sarno, an official of Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints, said it is impossible to say the exact number of saints.
The Catholic Church teaches that it does not make anyone into a saint. Instead, it recognizes a saint. In the Church, the title of Saint refers to a person who has been canonized (officially recognized) by the Catholic Church, and is therefore believed to be in Heaven.
Because the Church believes all people in Heaven are saints, there are many people believed to be in Heaven who have not been officially declared as saints. Sometimes the word "saint" is used to refer to Christians still living here on earth.
The veneration of saints, in Latin, "cultus", or the "cult of the saints", describes devotion to a particular saint or saints. Sometimes this is called "worship", but only in the old-sense meaning "to honor or give respect". According to the Catholic Church, Divine Worship is properly reserved only for God and never to the saints. Saints can be asked for help, just as one can ask someone on earth to pray for them.
A saint may be a patron saint of a cause or profession, or invoked against specific illnesses or disasters, sometimes by popular custom and sometimes by official statements of the Magisterium. Saints are not thought to have power of their own, but only that granted by God. 
A person who is seen as very holy can be declared a saint by a formal process, called canonization. Formal canonization is a lengthy process often taking many years, even centuries. The first step in this process is an investigation of the candidate's life, undertaken by an expert. After this, the report on the candidate is given to the bishop of the area and more studying is done. It is then sent to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome.
If the application is approved, the person may be granted the title of "Venerable". Further investigations may lead to the candidate's beatification and given title of "Blessed". At least two important miracles are required to be formally declared a saint. These miracles must have happened after the candidate died. Finally, when all of this is done the Pope canonizes the saint.
Once a person has been declared a saint, the body of the saint is considered holy. The remains of saints are called holy relics and are usually used in churches. Saints' personal belongings may also be used as relics. Some of the saints have a symbol that represents their life.
The word "saint" is not only used by Christianity. In many religions, there are people who have been recognized as having reached the highest goals of religious teaching. In English, the term saint is often used to translate this idea from many world religions.
Cuban SanterÃ­a, Haitian Vodou, Brazilian Umbanda and CandomblÃ©, and other similar syncretist religions adopted the Catholic saints, or at least the images of the saints, and applied their own spirits/deities to them. They are worshiped in churches (where they appear as saints) and in religious festivals, where they appear as the deities. The name "santerÃ­a" was originally a negative term for those whose worship of saints deviated from Catholic norms.
Buddhists hold the Arhats and Arahants in special esteem, as well as Bodhisattvas and Buddhas.
In Discordianism, anyone, living or dead, or even anything can be named a saint. Anyone may canonize anything or anyone else as everyone, whether they are aware of it or not, is a pope in the POEE. This is because "moral perfection isn't necessary for Discordian Sainthood. You just have to suffer a lot."
There are people who have been described as being Hindu saints, most of whom have also been more specifically identified by the terms Sant, Mahatma, Paramahamsa, or Swami, or with the titles "Sri" or "Srila".
The Arabic word "wali" (Arabic ÙÙÙ, plural AwliyÄ' Ø£ÙÙÙØ§Ø¡) is usually translated into English as "Saint". However, the "wali" should not be confused with the Christian tradition of sainthood. An important early scholar of Sunni Islamic beliefs, Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tahawi, mentioned in his book "Al-Aqidah At-Tahawiya":
"We do not prefer any of the saintly men among the Ummah over any of the Prophets but rather we say that any one of the Prophets is better than all the awliya' put together. We believe in what we know of Karamat, the marvels of the awliya' and in authentic stories about them from trustworthy sources.
Unlike Prophets and Messengers, the "awliya" can be either male and female. One of the best known female saints is Rabi`a al-Adawiyya.
It is widely regarded in Islam that the saints of saints is Ali Ibn Abi Talib the cousin of Muhammad all Sufi orders originate through his teachings. In addition all saints regard him as their champion 'The Saints of Saints'
In Sufism, the major "wali" are considered to have been masters in the art of spiritual purification. Some groups within Islam hold the Hadrat (literally, Presence, a title of Sufi saints) in esteem.
The word "Tzadik" "righteous", and its associated meanings, developed in Rabbinic thought from its Talmudic contrast with "Hasid" ("Pious" honorific), to its exploration in Ethical literature, and its spiritualisation in Kabbalah. In Hasidic Judaism, the institution of the Tzadik assumed central importance.
The concept of sant or bhagat is found in North Indian religious thought including Sikhism. Figures such as Kabir, Ravidas, Nanak, and others are widely regarded as belonging to the Sant tradition. Some of their mystical compositions are incorporated in the Guru Granth Sahib. The term "Sant" is still sometimes loosely applied to living individuals in the Sikh and related communities.

Apples and oranges

Apples and oranges is a common English idiom. It is used to describe unlike objects or people. One of the most well-known bits of popular wisdom in the English-speaking world is that apples and oranges cannot be compared. The ability to tell apples from oranges is learned. 
The phrase is almost always used along with a warning that things in different categories cannot be compared, or that the comparison is improper.
This idiom began as a comparison of "apples and oysters" in a book of proverbs published in 1670. This idiom has become a marker in English-speaking culture. Idioms are a common stumbling block for learners of a language.
The idiom is not uniquely English.
In French-speaking Quebec, the idiom is "comparer des pommes avec des oranges" (to compare apples and oranges), In Europe, the French idiom is "comparer des pommes et des poires" (to compare apples and pears).
In Latin America, the Spanish idiom is "comparar papas y boniatos" (comparing potatoes and sweet potatoes) or "comparar peras con manzanas" (comparing pears and apples). 
In British English, the phrase "chalk and cheese" means the same thing as "apples and oranges".
In order to compare anything, there needs to be a theory to be proven and framework for testing the theory. Three basic questions come first: 
The idiom has inspired scientific research projects. For example, the "British Medical Journal" published a study of red delicious apples compared with navel oranges. They were found to have many similarities.
There are differences in nutritional value.
Experiments at NASA Ames Research Center showed that apples and oranges decay at similar rates.

Hardness

Hardness is a measure of how hard a material is. Hard things resist pressure. Some examples of hard materials are diamond, carbides, quartz, tempered steel, ice, granite, concrete. 
Harder materials are more difficult to cut and shape than softer ones. They are also usually more brittle which means they do not bend much but can shatter. Hard materials are important in industry. Cutting tools, machines and construction materials are usually hard. 
The Mohs scale of mineral hardness is a scratch test of how hard minerals are. Compression tests and rebound tests are more used for metals and artificial materials.

Small Island Developing States

Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are low-lying coastal countries. They share similar problems because of their size. Some of these problems are: small but growing populations, limited resources, and long distances from other countries.
The SIDS were first seen as a distinct group of developing countries at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in June 1992. The Barbados Programme of Action was made in 1994 to help the SIDS to develop.
Currently, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs lists 52 small island developing states. These are broken down into three geographic regions: the Caribbean; the Pacific; and Africa, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean and South China Sea (AIMS). Each of these regions has a regional organisation for cooperation: the Caribbean Community, the Pacific Islands Forum and the Indian Ocean Commission.

Below is a list of the water bodies of Azerbaijan, which include rivers and lakes. Canals which are artificial rivers and reservoirs which are artifical lakes are also a part of Azerbaijan's water systems.
The hydrography of Azerbaijan basically belongs to the Caspian Sea drainage basin.
There are 8,359 rivers of various lengths within Azerbaijan. Of them 8,188 rivers are less than 25 kilometers in length. Only 24 rivers are over 100 kilometers long. The largest rivers that flow through the country are:
The rivers in Azerbaijan can be divided into three groups:
The Kur and Aras are the longest rivers in Azerbaijan. The rivers directly flow into the Caspian Sea. They come from the north-eastern slope of the Greater Caucasus and Talysh Mountains and run along the Samur-Devechi and Lenkeran lowlands.
The Kur River drainage basin area (86,000 kmÂ²) up to the junction with the Aras River is smaller than the Aras drainage basin (101,937 kmÂ²). The river is still called Kur on the junction because the water level of the Kura is twice as high as that of the Aras River.
There are over 60 water reservoirs. These help guide the river flow in Azerbaijan. Most of them are used for irrigation. The largest water reservoirs are:

Hulme

Hulme is an inner city area and electoral ward of Manchester, England which is south of Manchester city centre and divided from it by the River Medlock. Historically a part of Lancashire, the name Hulme comes from the Old Norse word for a small island, or land surrounded by water or marsh, showing that it was probably settled by Norse invaders during the period of the Danelaw.
The part of Hulme nearest to Old Trafford is known as Cornbrook from the Corn Brook, a tributary of the River Irwell. The Bridgewater Canal passes through Hulme. Chorlton-on-Medlock is to the east, Moss Side to the south and Old Trafford to the west.

Major Lance

Major Lance (April 4, 1939, 1941 or 1942, â September 3, 1994) was a solo singer. 'Major' was his given name; it was not a nickname or stage name. Born in Winterville, Mississippi, Lance moved to Chicago as a kid and became friends with Otis Leavill Cobb. Both of them took boxing and also worked at a drug store.
Although he was arrested a couple of times in his life and his earliest records were not successful, Lance was most known for his music hits in the United States called "Monkey Time" and "Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um". He was considered the most successful Okeh artist. After these hits, he became an iconic figure in Britain, where he lived throughout in the 1970s, among followers of Northern soul. 
Lance continued to tour and perform at clubs and music festivals, such as in the United Kingdom and England, until he died in 1994 from a certain heart attack at the age of 55. Lance is buried in Homewood, Illinois.
Major Lance was born in Winterville, Mississippi. There has been something confusing over Lance's birth year; some sources say he was born 1941 or 1942 (as Lance claimed), while his gravestone states he was born in 1939. 'Major' was his given name; it was not a nickname or stage name. Major Lance was one of 12 children. One of his hobbies was playing Baseball. 
Lance moved with his family on the northwest side of Chicago in the Cabrini-Green projects, where there was a lot of crime in the area, as a child. After moving to Chicago, he developed a boyhood friendship with another singer named Otis Leavill Cobb. They both attended Wells High School. This was the same school Curtis Mayfield and Jerry Butler, who were also both singers too, went to. Mayfield called him a "sparkly fellow, and a great basketball player, which is probably how we met. His hero was Jackie Wilson, and he was always coming round and looking through my bag for songs that I'd written but didn't want to do with the Impressions. He was pretty good at picking them, too." Lance and Otis both toke boxing and were also singing as members of the Five Gospel Harmonaires. Both of them also worked together at a drug store.
Lance and Otis Leavill formed a group named the Floats in the mid-1950s. However, they broke up before recording any songs. But Lance became a featured dancer on a local TV show named "Time for Teens", and presenter Jim Lounsbury gacve him a one-off record deal with Mercury Records. Mercury released his single "I Got a Girl", written and produced by Curtis Mayfield, in 1959, which was not successful. Because of this, Lance worked at various jobs over the next few years.
Lance signed with OKeh Records in 1962 as Curtis Mayfield recommended. Major was constantly showing up at the Okeh offices, offering to run errands for Carl Davis, telling him about the record he'd once made and how he and Curtis Mayfield were friends from their childhood. Major Lance's first single was called "Delilah", which was made by Curtis Mayfield. Although it was not successful, it made his partnership with a writing and arranging team for Curtis Mayfield, Carl Davis, and Johnny Pate, often with members of Mayfield's music group called The Impressions on backing vocals. Together they made a distinctive, Latin-tinged sound which epitomised Chicago soul unlike other music. 
Major Lance's second Okeh single was called "The Monkey Time". This song was also written by Mayfield. Unlike his first Okeh single, Monkey Time was a success, becoming #2 on the "Billboard" R&B chart. It was also the #8 pop hit in 1963. "The Monkey Time" became Okeh's first hit single for 10 years.
His hits quickly became more successful, including "Hey Little Girl", "Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um" (his biggest hit, reaching #5 in the US pop chart and #40 in the UK, where it was his only chart success. It was also one of the top 100 on the Billboard chart in 1964), "The Matador" (the only one not written by Mayfield), "Rhythm", "Sometimes I Wonder", "Come See", and "Ain't It A Shame".
Lance and Davis continued to work together, during the time Pate and Mayfield left Okeh Records. "Too Hot To Hold" was a minor hit, but they had poor success before Davis left the company in turn. During this period, Lance toured in the United Kingdom. This is where he was supported by Bluesology, a band including pianist Reggie Dwight (Reggie was later known as Elton John.). Over the next two years he began working with several music producers. Soon after Lance left OKeh Records in 1968 and moved to Dakar Records, where he had the Top 40 R&B hit "Follow the Leader." He then moved to Mayfield's label named Curtom Records, which resulted in his last two Top 40 R&B hits, "Stay Away From Me (I Love You too Much)" and "Must Be Love Coming Down." One of Lance's song recorded at Curtom called "Stay Away From Me" was listed #4 in Jet Magazine's "Soul Brothers Top 20". He left Curtom in 1971, and recorded Volt and Columbia Records labels for a short amount of time.
Lance moved to England in 1972. He was to become "legendary as a UK club act, known to deliver 110% at every performance." During his time in England, he recorded an album, "Major Lance's Greatest Hits Recorded Live At The Torch", recorded at The Torch, a club in Stoke on Trent, which has been described as "perhaps the best Northern Soul album ever made". Lance returned to Atlanta in 1974. He recorded an updated disco version of "Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um" for Playboy Records. He set up a new label, Osiris, with Al Jackson, a former drummer for Booker T and the MG, but again with little success, and his songs became less popular. But later found that his recordings had become popular on the beach music circuit in the Carolinas, where he continued to perform at live performances. He recorded a comeback album, "The Major's Back", and several tracks for the Kat Family label.
Major Lance was married to Christine Boular Lance, and had nine children. He was 6'6 foot tall.
Lance was arrested two times in his life. In 1965, Lance was arrested in violation of the Paternity Act. A Chicago Women, Para Lee Thomas, told she had a son named "Ronnie Maurice Lance" (born ). She declared Lance who promised to pay her doctor and hospital bills around 375$, but defaulted in the payment. Judge Benjamin J. Kanter issued for the arrest, setting Lance's bond at $1,000. After recording briefly for the Motown Records subsidiary label Soul in 1978, he was convicted of cocaine possession and was sentenced to four years in Jail.
In 1987, Lance was diagnosed with a heart attack, and he became nearly blind from glaucoma. As a result, he made no more recordings since. In June 1994, he gave his final performance at the 11th Chicago Blues Festival. In September of that year, he died in his sleep at the age of 55 of heart disease in Decatur, Georgia. He was survived by his family. He is buried at Washington Memory Gardens Cemetery in Homewood, Illinois.

Rachel Berry

Rachel Berry is a fictional character from the FOX musical comedy-drama series "Glee". The character is played by actress Lea Michele. The character first appeared in "Glee" from its pilot episode. It was first broadcast on May 19, 2009. Rachel was created by "Glee" creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. She is the glee club captain of the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio, where the show is set. Her storylines have seen her suffer feeling alone because of her ambition to win. She has also developed romantic feelings for Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff), a member of the rival (enemy) glee club Vocal Adrenaline. She also had many dates with quarterback and glee club co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith). The two eventually become engaged.
Michele has stated that she was just like Rachel when she was younger. She had inspiration to play the role as Rachel. These include the movie "Election" and other television roles such as the "Gossip Girl" character Blair Waldorf. Michele has said that she feels "vulnerable" while playing Rachel. She stated, "Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren't (are not) considered beautiful, and when I was in high school it was the same for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out." Michele added, "What's so great about "Glee" is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't matter: You can still be who you want to be."
Rachel is a "strong, driven girl" but somewhat nervous about herself. "Glee" follows Rachel's journey to become more of a team player. She does this to fulfill her own dreams. Michele was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for "Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series" in 2010. She was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for "Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy" in 2010 and 2011. Rachel has received mostly positive reviews from critics. Maureen Ryan of "The Chicago Tribune" thanked Michele for making the character "more than a humorless (not funny) stereotype". However, "The Wall Street Journal"s Raymund Flandez has described Rachel as "insufferable" (annoying). Several songs performed by Michele as Rachel have been released as digital download singles. They have also been included on the series' soundtrack albums.
Rachel is the daughter of an interracial same-sex couple. She is Jewish and was named after Rachel Green from "Friends". She joins the glee club. She hopes that fame will increase her popularity and to find a boyfriend. She is bullied by members of the school cheerleading and football teams. She is, however, excited that quarterback Finn Hudson joins the club. She then develops a crush on him. The two kisses in the episode "Showmance". However, Finn tells her to forget that it happened and continues dating his girlfriend, cheerleader Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron). Rachel quits the glee club. She does this because she is not given a solo she wanted. She is then given the lead role in the school musical, "Cabaret". However, she later quits the musical and rejoins the glee club. She returns because she rather have friends then be alone. She has a short relationship with another glee club member, Puck (Mark Salling). He is also Jewish, and is a football player who used to bully her. Rachel later breaks up with him because she still has feelings for Finn. She later learns that Quinn's pregnancy was not caused by him but by Puck. She then tells Finn the truth who then attacks Puck. Finn then breaks up with Quinn and drops out of glee club. He returns on the day of the group's first major competition, the Sectionals. He does this to undo damage by cheerleading couch Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch). The group makes up a completely new set list. Rachel starts the show with a solo of "Don't Rain on My Parade". They win by an agreement decision.
For a short time Rachel believes that she is dating Finn. However, he tells her that he needs to take time out for himself. He changes his mind soon after. By that time, Rachel has already begun dating Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff). He is the lead singer of the enemy glee club Vocal Adrenaline. The rest of the glee club tries to convince Rachel to break up with Jesse. However, he transfers (moved) to William McKinley. He then joins New Directions. Rachel tells Jesse that her dream is to find her birth mother. He offers to help her do so. However, he already knows who it is: Vocal Adrenaline coach Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel). Shelby asked Jesse to befriend Rachel. She hopes that it might reconnect with her daughter. Shelby cannot directly contact Rachel until she is eighteen. When Rachel discovers that Shelby is her mother they begin to talk. They both confess to not feel an anything. They eventually decide to not develop a relationship. Jesse betrays Rachel and returns to Vocal Adrenaline. In the episode "Journey to Regionals", Finn tells Rachel that he loves her. Although they lose the competition to Vocal Adrenaline, they become a couple.
Sue Sylvester tells glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) about a rule. The rule is that there has to be a minimum of twelve students when competing. Will tells the glee club that they have to find new members. At first Rachel encourages Sunshine Corazon (Charice) to try out. However, when she realizes that she is a good singer, she gives her wrong directions to the auditions. She gives Sunshine directions to an inactive (no longer in service) crack house. Sunshine then transfers (moves to) Carmel High School and joins Vocal Adrenaline. Puck and Finn's friendship becomes stronger again. They work together and sing horribly at the duets competition. They do this so new club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) wins instead. They want him to feel welcomed and appreciated by the club. Rachel later finds out that Finn slept with cheerleader Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) the previous year. At the time, Rachel was dating Jesse. Finn lied to Rachel, though Rachel herself had lied. She said she slept with Jesse which she had not. Feeling hurt, she makes out with Puck to hurt Finn back. This causes Finn to break up with her. Rachel later tries get back with Finn.

Rachel is portrayed by Lea Michele. Younger Rachel has been played by Lauren Boles. When Ryan Murphy was casting for "Glee", he wanted actors who could take on theatrical roles. Murphy did not want to do network casting calls. He instead, spent three months on Broadway. He found Michele, who was starring in "Spring Awakening". The role of Rachel was written just for Michele. In an interview with "The Washington Post", Michele commented on her casting, saying: "I was kind of just thrown into thisâthis is one of the first television jobs I've ever had. Of course being able to sing helps bring a sense of comfort. The character I'm playing is really outgoingâshe performs in her everyday life as though she's performing in front of a huge audience."
In December 2010, Murphy announced that the cast of "Glee" would be replaced. He stated that the replacements would happen at the end of the third season. Which would be around the time when they graduate. Murphy said: "Every year we're going to add a new group [of people]. There's nothing more sad than a high schooler with a bald spot." He also revealed that some of the original cast will leave as early as 2012: "I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives." Murphy said in July 2011 that Michele would be one of the actors leaving. Michele commented on this, saying: "We always knew we'd graduate in real time. It's all part of the plan and it's all good! It's going to make Season 3 amazing! This is just the beginning!" However, Falchuk later stated that Michele, along with Chris Colfer and Cory Monteith will graduate at the end of the third season. He also said: "because they're (they are) graduating doesn't mean they're (they are) leaving the show." Falchuk also said: "it was never our plan or our intention to let them goâ¦. They are not done with the show after this season."
Sandra Gonzalez of "Entertainment Weekly" commented on the news about the cast leaving. She said: "Indeed, a rolling cast list has done some shows good in the past. I'll admit that it took me some time to warm up to the 'new kids' on "Friday Night Lights", which ends its run tomorrow on NBC, but it was a well-done transition. What I loved most was that the new blood (group) didn't (did not) try to be the new versions of the old characters. They were new characters with completely different outlooks and goals. "Glee" could learn a lot from what "Friday Night Lights" accomplished (have done successfully): a seamless, realistic (real) transition (change). The problem? 'Seamless' and 'realistic' have never been "Glee"s strong points, which is not to say they couldn't (could not) be. But the question is: Is "Glee" looking to be the less-attractive comedy cousin of "Friday Night Lights"â¦ or "Saved By the Bell: The New Class"?"
Michele took the role as Rachel because of her characterization. Michele explained: "Not only is she a singer, but she has so much heartâI think it's what we need on TV. A show that is filled with heart and love that is funny. It sends an amazing message to kids about the arts and being who you are." Michele described the first thirteen episodes of "Glee". She described it as: "Rachel's journey of finding herself within the glee club". She also said that "she's learning how to be a team player and work within this group. She's a very strong, driven girl, who's (who is) sometimes a little misunderstood."
"Glee"s costume designer Lou Eyrich described Rachel's costumes. Eyrich told "Entertainment Weekly": "Originally (at first), the inspiration for her look was Tracy Flick from "Election"âvery buttoned-down (someone who is serious in the job they are doing), preppy (someone who looks like a high school student), obnoxious (not very well liked by people), squeaky clean, nerdy. But she's got at least 12 costume changes each episode. That same look all the time just gets boring for the screen (television) and for the actress to wear, so we spread it out a lot. We try to have her buttoned-up or wearing a nerdy sweater over a cute dress, like she doesn't quite get it right. Or she takes that sweater and tucks it into the skirt and pairs it with knee highs and flats. She makes it her way, which is more quirky. The popular girls find a way to make it look cool, but Rachel makes it look nerdy. But it's not old-school nerdy with thick glasses and pocket protectors. She thinks she's taking a trend and making it cool, but she wears it wrong."
Michele have stated that she was just like Rachel when she was younger. She also gets inspiration from the movie "Election", and "Gossip Girl" character Blair Waldorf. She has explained: "[Blair] is shady (a mean person), but you still love her. She's still vulnerable (easy to get hurt). That's what I try to do with Rachel. Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren't (are not) considered beautiful, and when I was in high school it was the same for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out. I was not cool. What's so great about Glee is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't (does not) matter: You can still be who you want to be. And in four years, high school will be over and all of that crap won't (will not) matter anyway."
Some songs performed by Michele as Rachel have been released as digital download singles. They were also on the soundtrack albums, "Glee: The Music, Volume 1" and "Glee: The Music, Volume 2". Rachel has received positive reviews from critics. Michele was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for "Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series" in 2010. She also was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for "Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy" in 2010. Robert A. George of the "New York Post" stated "the only female [in Glee] who doesn't (does not) come across as manipulative (easy to tell someone what to do) or vapidly (nothing good about her) helpless" (not able to help her own self). "Chicago Tribune"s Maureen Ryan wrote, "Lea Michele not only has an amazing voice but manages to make her character, spoiled (get's whatever she wants in life) diva Rachel Berry, more than a humorless (not funny) stereotype." Denise Martin of "The Los Angeles Times" commented in her review of the episode "The Rhodes Not Taken": "if there's any justice in the world, Lea Michele will win a Golden Globe and an Emmy for playing Rachel".
In the episode "Hairography", Kurt Hummel gives Rachel a bad make over. Mike Hale of the "New York Times" remembered a popular theme that critics give negative reviews because of the way "Glee" treats its female characters. Hale said that he understands why, but also says that the show equally treats male characters the same. However, he wrote that "it was a bit much when Finn looked at Rachel in her catsuit and frizzy hair and said she looked like a 'sad clown hooker.' Come on. She looked fantastic (really good)." Zap2it's Korbi Ghosh commented: "when we saw Rachel fall for them (Finn and Puck), she was actually relatable. Likable even. The type-A (best), uber-talented, self-involved (gets into things by herself) know-it-all (a person who believes they know everything) who's usually alienating her classmates let her guard down to expose (to show) a vulnerable side. And, as a bonus, we got some super solid musical performances from those awkward courtships."
Michele has won a number of awards for her portrayal of Rachel. Michele won the Satellite Awards for "Best Performance by an Actress in a Musical or Comedy Television Series" in 2009. She also won, as part of the cast, for "Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series" at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. In 2010, Michele won the NewNowNext Awards for "Brink of Fame: Actor". In 2009, she was nominated for a Teen Choice Awards in the category "Choice TV Breakout Star". That same year, Michele was nominated for a Golden Globe for "Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy". She also was nominated for an Emmy Award for "Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series". She received another Teen Choice Award nomination in 2010 for "Choice TV Actress: Comedy". Michele was included in "Time" magazine's 2010 list of the "100 Most Influential People In the World". Her cover of The All-American Rejects' "Gives You Hell" reached the top 40 on the US "Billboard" 200. Michele is featured as lead singer in 14 of the top 20 selling Glee Cast songs as of 2010. She won the 2012 People's Choice Award for "Favorite TV Comedy Actress".
Michele was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 2011. The first for "Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals" ("Don't Stop Believin"). The second for "Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television, or Other Visual Media" ("Glee: The Music, Volume 1"). Michele said of the first Grammy nomination: "I like that it's for 'Don't Stop Believin", which is for the whole cast, so that we all get to go. That's just awesome." She was nominated again for "Best Actress- Television Series Musical or Comedy" at the 2011 Golden Globe Awards. The cast of Glee was also nominated for the "Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series" award at the 2011 and 2012 Screen Actors Guild Awards.

Hermaphroditus

In Greek mythology, Hermaphroditus was the son of Hermes and Aphrodite. He was a minor god of fertility and symbolized the unity of male and female. His name is the origin of the word hermaphrodite.
According to a myth of Ovid, he was raised by nymphs in a cave on Mount Ida. At the age of fifteen, he traveled to the cities of Lydia and Caria in Asia Minor. It was there that he came upon a pool of fresh water. He undressed and bathed in the pool. Meanwhile, the nymph of the pool Salmacis, fell in love with him. She jumped into the pool and embraced him, not letting go, he struggled to get away from her. Salmacis prayed to the gods that they should never separate and the gods hearing her prayer, merged their bodies together, transforming Hermaphroditus into an androgynous being. Hermaphroditus, in anger of his transformation, cursed the pool so that anyone who bathed in it would suffer the same fate.
The worship of Hermaphroditus originated from Cyprus, under the name of Aphroditus. The cult was introduced into mainland Greece around the late 5th century BC. At rituals and sacrifices to the god, worshipers cross-dressed; men wearing women's clothing and women dressed in men's clothing. The god was also identified with the moon, because the moon was thought to be both male and female.
Hermaphroditus was a popular subject in ancient Greek and Roman art. He is often shown alone and sometimes interacting with satyrs and cupids. There is a famous statue called "The Sleeping Hermaphroditus" at the Louvre Museum in Paris.

Max Payne

Max Payne is a third-person shooter video game made by Finnish developers Remedy Entertainment and published by Gathering of Developers in July 2001 for Microsoft Windows. Later in 2001, ports for PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameBoy Advance were published by Rockstar Games. A Macintosh port was published in July 2002 by MacSoft in North America, and by Feral Interactive in the rest of the world. There were plans for a Dreamcast version of "Max Payne", but they were cancelled because of the console had stopped being made. The game was again released in April 2009 as a downloadable game for the Xbox Originals program for the Xbox 360.
The game features a neo-noir type style and uses comic strips (with voice-overs) in place of animated cutscenes to narrate the game. This is because it is inspired by hard-boiled detective novels by authors like Mickey Spillane. The game contains many references to Norse mythology, particularly the myth of RagnarÃ¶k. Several of the names used in the game are those of Norse gods. The gameplay is very much influenced by the Hong Kong action cinema genre, particularly the work of director John Woo, and it was the first game to feature the bullet time effect made famous in "The Matrix".
"Max Payne" got very good reviews from critics and was praised for its exciting gun play and use of noir storytelling devices. As of 2012, the "Max Payne" franchise has sold over 7.5 million copies. The game has also won a BAFTA Award.

Nautiloid

Nautiloids are a large and varied group of marine cephalopods (Mollusca) in the subclass Nautiloidea. They began in the later Cambrian. "Nautilus" is the only surviving genus. 
Nautiloids flourished during the early Palaeozoic era, when they were the main predatory animals. They developed an extraordinary range of shell shapes and forms. Some 2,500 species of fossil nautiloids are known, though only a few species survive today.
Nautiloids are among the group of animals known as cephalopods. The cephalopods are an advanced class of molluscs. The cephalopods also include ammonoids, Belemnites and modern coleoids such as octopus and squid. 
Traditionally, the most common classification of the cephalopods has been a three-fold division into the nautiloids, ammonoids, and coleoids. This article is about nautiloids in that broad sense, sometimes called Nautiloidea "sensu lato".
Cladistically speaking, nautiloids are a paraphyletic group united by shared primitive (basal) features not found in derived cephalopods. In other words, they are a evolutionary grade that is thought to have given rise to both ammonoids and coleoids. They are defined by the exclusion of both those descendent groups. Both ammonoids and coleoids probably descended from bactritids, which in turn arose from straight-shelled orthocerid nautiloids. 
The ammonoids (a group which includes the ammonites and the goniatites) are extinct cousins of the nautiloids which evolved early in the Devonian, some 400 million years ago.

Aphroditus

The worship of Aphroditus comes from Cyprus, a cult of a masculine or hermaphrodite form of Aphrodite. The divinity was introduced into Greece and celebrated in Athens in a cross-dressing ritual.
It is thought that Hesiod's myth, explaining the birth of Aphrodite, born when Cronus cut off the genitals of Uranus and threw it into the sea, originated from the cult of Aphroditus. A terracotta plaque from the 7th century BC found at Perachora in Greece, representing Aphroditus emerging from severed male genitals, suggests this, as there are two different myths of the creation of Aphrodite.
According to Macrobius, Aphroditus was represented in Cyprus with a beard and phallus, wearing female clothing and holding a scepter. At sacrifices to the god, worshipers cross-dressed, men wearing women's clothing and women dressed in men's clothing. The cult spread from Cyprus into southern Asia Minor, eventually reaching mainland Greece around the late 5th century BC. In Athens, the iconography of the god took on the "anasyromenos" pose, a female figure lifting her dress to reveal an erect phallus, a gesture that had apotropaic qualities, much like the god Priapus. By the Hellenistic period, the cult and votives had spread throughout Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy.
Gradually over time the cult lost popularity, Aphroditus was also being called Hermaphroditus, which originally meant Aphroditus in the form of a herm or "a herm of Aphroditus". These were marble or bronze sculptures with a head or torso above a plain rectangular pillar, a symbol of fertility. In later Greek mythology, Hermaphroditus came to be known as the son of Hermes and Aphrodite.

Transuranium element

Every transuranium element is a chemical element with an atomic number greater than the atomic number of Uranium. These elements have atomic numbers greater than 92.
The word "transuranium" is made of two parts. The Greek prefix "trans-" means "beyond" or "across". The second part of the word is the name of the element "uranium". 
Many transuranium elements are unstable and are not found in nature. An element that is unstable will split into two or more other elements. The process of fission occurs when an element splits into pieces.

Stupendemys

Stupendemys is a prehistoric genus of freshwater turtle. Its fossils have been found in northern South America, in rocks dating from the late Miocene to the very start of the Pliocene, about 6 to 5 million years ago.
"Stupendemys"'s carapace measured over in length and was also very wide. With a total carapace length of at least 11 feet (3.3 m) it was the largest turtle that ever existed, surpassing even "Archelon". 
Two species have been described to date. "Stupendemys geographicus" from Venezuela, and "Stupendemys souzai", a bit smaller and more slender, from Brazil.
Its weight helped "Stupendemys" stay under water for long periods, grazing on aquatic plants. It was probably a very weak swimmer, unable to move its bulk against a swift current, and probably avoided smaller streams.
Altogether, the fauna of the time had many large herbivores and few terrestrial carnivores. The habitat was mostly low-lying rainforest that was seasonally flooded, as well as floodplains and swampland. The rivers must have been wide and slow-moving.

Carol Greider

Carolyn Widney "Carol" Greider (born April 15, 1961) is an American molecular biologist. She is Professor and Director of Molecular Biology and Genetics at Johns Hopkins University. 
Greider discovered the enzyme telomerase in 1984, when she was a graduate student of Elizabeth Blackburn at the University of California, Berkeley. Greider pioneered research on the structure of telomeres, the ends of the chromosomes. She was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, with Blackburn and Jack Szostak, for their discovery that telomeres are protected from progressive shortening by the enzyme telomerase.

<doc id="336823" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336823" title="Telomerase">
Telomerase

Telomerase is an RNA protein which is an enzyme. It adds DNA sequence repeats ("TTAGGG" in all vertebrates) to the end of DNA strands in the telomere regions. 
The telomeres are disposable buffers blocking the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. They are a region of repeated nucleotides containing noncoding DNA. Telomeres are destroyed during cell division, and are remade by the enzyme telomerase.
The function of telomeres is to avoid the loss of important DNA from chromosome ends. Every time the chromosome is copied 100â200 meaningless nucleotides are lost, which causes no damage to the organism's DNA. So, the telomeres are shortened after each replication cycle, and then are restored to their proper length by telomerase. Telomerases carry their own RNA molecule, which is used as a template to elongate the telomeres.
The existence of a compensatory mechanism (a 'fix') for telomere shortening was first predicted by Soviet biologist Alexey Olovnikov in 1973. He also suggested the telomere hypothesis of ageing and the telomere's connections to cancer. 
Telomerase was discovered by Carol Greider and Elizabeth Blackburn in 1984 in the ciliate "Tetrahymena". Together with Jack Szostak, Greider and Blackburn were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery.

Luc Montagnier

Luc Antoine Montagnier (born 18 August 1932 in Chabris, Indre, France) is a French virologist and joint recipient with FranÃ§oise BarrÃ©-Sinoussi and Harald zur Hausen of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, for his discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). He currently works as a full time professor at Shanghai Jiaotong University.
In 2009 he published two controversial research studies which, if true, "would be the most significant experiments performed in the past 90 years, demanding re-evaluation of the whole conceptual framework of modern chemistry". 
Homeopaths claim his research as support for homeopathy, but Montagnier himself says it cannot be extended to homeopathy. Many scientists have greeted it with scorn and harsh criticism.

An interracial marriage is a marriage between two people of different races. In some countries, it is against the law to marry someone of a different race. These countries include, Germany (during the Nazi period), South Africa under apartheid, and some U.S. states in the United States before a 1969 ruling. In some Arab countries, it is forbidden for an Arab to marry outside their race because of the law and traditional customs. If an Arab person marries someone out of their race their civil rights are taken away from them. In 2008, Pakistani senators allowed women to be buried alive, if found guilty, of marrying someone outside their race.

Lee Hartwell

Leland Harrison (Lee) Hartwell (born October 30, 1939, in Los Angeles, California) is former president and director of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington. He shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Paul Nurse and Tim Hunt, for their discoveries of protein molecules that control cell division.
When cells divide, they divide in phases called G1 (growth), S (synthesis), G2 (growth), and M (mitosis). Nurse, Hartwell and Hunt together discovered two proteins, cyclin and CDK (cyclin dependent kinase), which control the change from one stage to another. These proteins are called "checkpoints", because they check whether the cell has divided properly. If the cell does not divide correctly, other proteins will try to repair it. If that does not work, they will destroy the cell. If a cell divides incorrectly and survives, it may cause cancer and other serious diseases.
Working in baker's yeast ("Saccharomyces cerevisiae"), Hartwell identified the fundamental role of checkpoints in cell cycle control, and CDC genes such as CDC28, which controls the start of the cycle â the progression through G1.

Formula One car

A Formula One car is a racing car used in Formula One races. They have one seat, which is open to the air. They have aerodynamic wings on their front and rear, and the engine is positioned behind the driver. The regulations governing the cars are unique to the Formula One championship. The regulations say that cars must be built by the racing teams themselves, though the design and manufacture can be done by others.
F1 Cars have technology to make them faster, more drag resistant and safer. Some of this technology is described below.
ERS stand for Energy Recovery Systems. There are two basic types of ERS systems - mechanical and electrical and both recover energy without using fuel and damaging the environment. The rule to use KERS was introduced by the FIA in 2009. It works by storing energy in a flywheel or battery (like the one on the right) that would be lost when braking, and allow that energy to be re-used when accelerating. ERS was introduced in 2014 to activate wherever a driver chose permanently throughout a race weekend
This is used a lot in corners because it controls the wheel spin when under and over steering. They mean simply to which end of the car runs out of grip first as the tyres only have limited amount of grip. In an under steer, the front axle and wheels runs out of grip first and in Over steer the rear end runs out first. When this happens it is like a handbrake skid. Traction Control is the device that tries to keep the car stable by adjusting the wheel movement in these turns.
DRS stand for Drag Reduction System. It is an addition to the rear wing of the car introduced in 2011 Formula 1 season aimed at reducing aerodynamic drag in order to promote overtaking. It is used when a driver is close to somebody in front of him. He will be able to open the rear wing so the car becomes more streamline and aerodynamic so he can overtake his opponent. The device is then disabled as soon as he overtakes his opponent.
Formula One teams do much research into materials. Below are list of materials used in the F1 world, what they are, what they do, where they're placed and why F1 teams choose them over everything else.
Carbon fibre is a very strong and light material that contains carbon fibres. It may sometimes contain other fibres such as Kevlar, aluminium and glass. Although it has a very big price tag, its strength to weight ratio and the good rigidity of it make it a very valuable piece of material. However as is it gets cheaper it is being used in much smaller products like sports equipment, bodies for instruments and also household objects.
Carbon fibre is most commonly used in the bodywork of an F1 car and also the air box, the wings, the engine cover, steering wheel and in the suspension. It is sometimes reinforced with titanium or steel.
It is used over every other kind of material because itâs lightweight, very strong, very stiff and can easily be moulded into any shape. 
Kevlar is another fibre like carbon. Some of its properties are very similar. Kevlar is a very strong and lightweight material. If you have an equal amount of steel and Kevlar, Kevlar would be 5 times stronger than the steel. When it is woven, it is suitable to take underwater. Kevlar is also used by the army as it a very sturdy material and it is used to make a range of items like helmets.
Kevlar is used in pretty much the same areas as carbon fibre is used. For example it is used in the bodywork, the wings, the suspension and more.
Kevlar is an extremely firm material. As F1 cars go at high speed it adds extra protection to drivers and stops massive damage being done to the cars.
Aluminium is an element. It is very light and hard. It is often used for ships so that ship doesnât get corroded and it is very stable due to its oxide coating. Aluminium is used in the bodywork and almost every single part of a F1 car. Aluminium is used because it is extremely light and very strong.
Magnesium is another chemical element and is very light and strong. Its main use is to combine with aluminium to make alloys which are extremely light and strong, such as magnalium. It is used mainly in the wheels and some small parts in the engines.
Gold foil is a type of foil which is gold coloured and stops heat from escaping. It is used between the engine and fuel tank. It is used in that certain position so it can stop heat transfer from the engine to the fuel tank.

Structural isomer

Structural isomerism (IUPAC call this constitutional isomerism) is a kind of isomerism. Two chemical in this isomerism have the same molecular formula, but the molecules have bonded together in different orders. The opposite of structual isomerism is stereoisomerism. There are many words that represents structual isomers.
There are three kinds of constitutional isomers. They are skeletal isomers, positional isomers, and functional isomers. Positional isomers are also called regioisomers. Tautomers are also a kind of functional isomers.
In skeletal isomerism, or chain isomerism, components of the skeleton (usually carbon) are re-ordered to make different structures. Pentane has three isomers. They are "n"-pentane (often called simply "pentane"), isopentane (methylbutane) and neopentane (dimethylpropane).
In position isomerism, a functional group or other substituent changes its position on a parent structure. In the table below, the hydroxyl group can stay in three different positions on an n-pentane chain to make three different compounds.
Many aromatic isomers exist because substituents can be positioned on different parts of the benzene ring. Only one isomer of phenol or hydroxybenzene exists but cresol or methylphenol has three isomers where the additional methyl group can be placed on three different positions on the ring. Xylenol has one hydroxyl group and two methyl groups and a total of 6 isomers exist.
Functional isomers are one of the structural isomers. Two compounds in functional isomerism have the same molecular formula (the number of each atom is the same, like cyclohexane: and 1-hexene:). But, the atoms are connected in other ways so that the groupings are different. We call these groups of atoms functional groups, functionalities, or moieties. Another way to say this is that two compounds that have the same molecular formula, but have different functional groups, are functional isomers.
For example, the chemical formula of cyclohexane and 1-hexene are CH. We call them functional group isomers because cyclohexane is a cycloalkane and hex-1-ene is an alkene.
For two molecules to be functional isomers, they must contain key groups of atoms arranged in particular ways. Some of the best examples come from organic chemistry. CHO is a molecular formula. Depending on how the atoms are arranged, it can represent two different compounds dimethyl ether CH-O-CH or ethanol CHCH-O-H. Dimethyl ether and ethanol are functional isomers. The first is an ether. The carbon chain-oxygen-carbon chain functionality is called an ether. The second is an alcohol. The carbon chain-oxygen-hydrogen functionality is called an alcohol.
If the functionalities stay the same, but their locations change, the structural isomers are not functional isomers. 1-Propanol and 2-propanol are structural isomers, but they are not functional isomers. Both of them are alcohols. The functional group (carbon chain-O-H) is present in both of these compounds, but they are not the same.
While some chemists use the terms structural isomer and functional isomer interchangeably, not all structural isomers are functional isomers.
Functional isomers are most often identified in chemistry using infrared spectroscopy. Infrared radiation corresponds to the energies associated primarily with molecular vibration. The alcohol functionality has a very distinct vibration called OH-stretch that is due to hydrogen bonding. All alcohols in liquid and solid form absorb infrared radiation at certain wavelengths.
Compounds with the same functional groups will all absorb certain wavelengths of infrared light because of the vibrations associated with those groups. In fact, the infrared spectrum is divided into two regions. The first part is called the functional group region. Dimethyl ether and ethanol would have dissimilar infrared spectra in the functional group region.
The second part of the infrared spectrum is called the fingerprint region; it is associated with types of motion allowed by the symmetry of the molecule and influenced by the bond energies. The fingerprint region is more specific to an individual compound. Even though 1-propanol and 2-propanol have similar infrared spectra in the functional group region, they differ in the fingerprint region.
In simple terms, functional isomers are structural isomers that have different functional groups like alcohol and ether.
As an example of isomer counting, 7 structural isomers exist with molecular formula CHO, each with different bond connectivities and air-stable at ambient temperature. An additional two structural isomers are the enol tautomers of the carbonyl isomers, but these are not stable.

Karl Pearson

Karl Pearson FRS (27 March 1857 â 27 April 1936) was an influential English mathematician. He helped establish the discipline
of mathematical statistics.
"Carl Pearson" became "Karl Pearson" by accident when he enrolled at the University of Heidelberg in 1879. They changed the spelling. He used both versions of his name until 1884 when he finally adopted Karl. Eventually he became known as "KP".
In 1911 he founded the world's first university statistics department at University College London. He was a proponent of eugenics, and a protÃ©gÃ© and biographer of Sir Francis Galton.
A conference was held in London on 23 March 2007, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of his birth.
Pearson met Charles Darwin's cousin Francis Galton, who was interested in heredity and eugenics. Pearson became Galton's protÃ©gÃ©, at times close to hero worship.
After Galton's death in 1911, Pearson started on a massive three-volume biography of Galton. The biography was done "to satisfy myself and without regard to... the needs of publishers or to the tastes of the reading public". It celebrated Galton's life, work, and talent. He predicted (wrongly) that Galton, rather than Charles Darwin, would be remembered as the most prodigious grandson of Erasmus Darwin.
When Galton died, he left much of his estate to University College London for a Chair in Eugenics. Pearson was the first holder of this chair, in accordance with Galton's wishes. He formed the Department of Applied Statistics, which included the Biometric and Galton laboratories. He stayed with the department until his retirement in 1933, and continued to work until his death in 1936.
Pearson's ideas helped build the statistical methods in common use today.

Yutyrannus

Yutyrannus is a Tyrannosauroid dinosaur, an early forebear of "Tyrannosaurus rex". 
It lived during the Lower Cretaceous 
124.6 million years ago (mya). It was about 10 meters long and 3 meters tall, and is the largest known dinosaur with direct evidence of feathers. It is forty times heavier than the previous record holder, "Beipiaosaurus". The feathers were long, up to , and filamentous. 
The fossil was found in what is now northeastern China. Three fossils of "Y. huali", were all found in the rock beds of Liaoning Province. Because of its size, it is certain that "Yutyrannus" could not fly. The feathers supported other functions, such as temperature regulation and visual signalling. 
"Yutyrannus" is known from three nearly complete fossil specimens (an adult, a subadult and a juvenile). They were got from a fossil dealer who claimed all three were found in a single quarry at Batuyingzi in Liaoning Province. They were probably found in a layer of the Yixian Formation.

Evil eye

The evil eye is a look that is believed by many cultures to be able to cause harm, injury, misfortune or bad luck for the person it is directed at. This could be for reasons of envy, jealousy or dislike. In some forms, it is the belief that a person can bestow a curse on someone when giving an "evil look" out of envy or jealousy.

Capri is an island in the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is on the south side of the Gulf of Naples, Italy. The main town on the island shares the name. It has been a resort since the time of the Roman Republic. The Emperor Tiberius lived here from 26â31 AD.
Features of the island are the Belvedere of Tragara (a high panoramic promenade lined with villas), the limestone crags called sea stacks that project above the sea (the "Faraglioni"), the town of Anacapri, the Blue Grotto ("Grotta Azzurra"), and the ruins of the Imperial Roman villas.
Capri is part of the region of Campania, Province of Naples. Most people on the island live in the town of Capri. The island has two harbours, Marina Piccola and Marina Grande (the main port of the island). The separate "comune" of Anacapri is high on the hills to the west.
The etymology of the name 'Capri' is unclear.

Hypochondriasis (more well known as hypochondria) is a condition which involves excess worries about having an illness that often results from having inaccurate perceptions of the human body. People with hypochondria are often very worried about their health even though there is no real medical condition. They become unduly alarmed of even the slightest physical symptom in their very bodies and are convinced they are about to become sick or have health problems.

Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa

Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa (c. 63 BC â 12 BC) was a general of the Roman Empire and a statesman. He was a close friend and brother-in-law of Augustus.
Agrippa's place of birth is not known for sure. It may have been the city of Arpinum. His father was callled Lucius Vipsanius Agrippa (we know this from an inscription on the Pantheon). He had an elder brother, and a sister named Vipsania Polla. The family had not been prominent in Roman public life. 
Agrippa first married Caecilia Attica, the daughter of Cicero's friend T. Pomponius Atticus. They a daughter â Vipsania Agrippina, and perhaps another: 'Vipsania Minor'. Vipsania Agrippina became the wife of Tiberius. 
By his second marriage to Claudia Marcella (oldest daughter of Octavia) he probably had a single surviving daughter. 
His third wife, Julia (daughter of Augustus) bore him three sons and two daughters: Gaius (born 20 BC), Julia the Younger, Lucius (born 17 BC), Agrippina the Elder (born ca. 15 BC), and Postumus Agrippa. The last child was born in 12 BC after the death of Agrippa. Agrippa died in March 12 BC. Agrippa's more famous descendents stem from his daughter Agrippina: they include his grandson Caligula and great-grandson Nero.
Agrippa fought in Caesar's Civil War (49â45 BC), giving help to Octavian against Lucius Antonius. 
Later services include his defeat of Sextus Pompey at Naolochus, Antony and Cleopatra at Actium, and the fall of Egypt. Later he completed of the conquest of Spain and fought in the North and East. For his valuable services he held three consulships (37, 28, 27 BC). He became Tribune of the plebs in 18 BC and renewed in 13, making him Augustus' unofficial co-emperor. He died at the height of his power in March 12 BC.

Totem and Taboo

Totem and Taboo is a book by Sigmund Freud. It is four articles in the magazine "Imago" then combined as a book in 1914. The first article is "The Horror of Incest", the second "Taboo and Emotional Ambivalence", the third "animism, magic, and the omnipotence of thought", and the fourth "the return of totemism in childhood". It was written partly as a response to Wilhelm Wundt's ideas on psychology, and partly as a response to Carl Jung's ideas. It describes Freud's idea of how the incest taboo began. The last article combines Charles Darwin's idea of an ancient family with William Robertson Smith's idea of human sacrifice being the origin of religious ceremonies, to argue that an ancient group of brothers killed their polygamous father and took his wives and then created totemism as an idea to create conscience and prevent their action from being repeated.

Alexander Gorsky

Alexander Gorsky (6 August 1871-1924) was a Russian ballet choreographer and a contemporary of Marius Petipa. He is known for restaging Petipaâs classical ballets such as "Swan Lake", "Don Quixote", and "The Nutcracker". Gorsky "sought greater naturalism, realism, and characterization" in ballet. He valued acting skills over "bravura" technique (a showy display of skills such as many turns or high jumps.) His interpretations of ballets were often controversial and he often used artists outside the dance world to create sets and costumes. Gorsky gave continuity to the plots of Petipaâs ballets and removed excessive choreography that did not relate to the story.

William Smith (geologist)

William 'Strata' Smith (23 March 1769 â 28 August 1839) was an English geologist, who created the first nationwide geological map. 
Like another great scientist of his time, Michael Faraday, he was the son of a blacksmith. His geological discoveries were made when, as a young man, he was a surveyor, and so travelled the country. Smith's greatest discovery was that sedimentary rocks of a similar age held fossils of a similar type. So he could identify them when they were at the surface in different parts of the country.
Smith put together the geological history of Britain (England and Wales) and southern Scotland into a single record. At the time his map was published he was almost unknown to the scientific community. His humble family and education meant he did not mix easily in learned society. His work was plagiarised, he was financially ruined, and he spent time in debtors' prison. It was only later in his life that Smith got recognition for what he had done.
In 1799 Smith produced the first large scale geologic map of the area around Bath, Somerset. Before, he only knew how to draw the vertical extent of the rocks, but not how to display them horizontally. Then, in the Somerset County Agricultural Society, he found a map showing the types of soil and vegetation around Bath and their geographical extent. The different types were coloured. Using this technique, Smith could draw a geological map from his observations showing the outcrops of the rocks. He took a few rock types, each with its own colour. Then he estimated the boundaries of each of the outcrops of rock, filled them in with colour and ended up with a crude geological map.
In 1801, he drew a rough sketch of what would become "The map that changed the world". 
In 1815 he published the first geological map of Britain. Conventional symbols were used to mark canals, tunnels, tramways and roads, collieries, lead, copper and tin mines, together with salt and alum works. The various geological types were indicated by different colours; the maps were hand coloured. The map is remarkably similar to modern geological maps of England. He also published his "Delineation of the strata of England" in the same year. In another of his books "Strata identified by organized fossils" (London 1816â1819) he recognised that strata contained distinct fossils. These fossil assemblages could be used to match rocks between regions. This marks Smith as an important figure in the history of stratigraphy.
In 1817 he drew a remarkable geological vertical section from Snowdon to London. Unfortunately, his maps were soon copied (plagiarised) and sold for prices lower than he was asking. He went into debt and finally became bankrupt.
On 31 August 1819 Smith was released from King's Bench Prison in London, a debtor's prison. He returned to his home at 15 Buckingham Street to find a bailiff at the door and his home and property seized. Smith again worked as an travelling surveyor for years. One of his employers, Sir John Johnstone, recognised him and took steps to get him the respect he deserved. Between 1824 and 1826 he lived and worked in Scarborough. There he was responsible for the building of the Rotunda, a geological museum devoted to the Yorkshire coast. The Rotunda was re-opened as 'Rotunda â The William Smith Museum of Geology', on 9 May 2008.

Cybele

In Anatolian mythology, Cybele was the personification of the earth. She was the goddess of nature, fertility, mountains, and wild animals. She is often represented sitting on a throne, flanked by two lions, and wearing a mural crown. In Phrygian myth, she was born a hermaphroditic being named Agdistis, a child of Zeus and Gaia. Cybele had a shepherd consort named Attis, and a priesthood of eunuchs called the Galli. Her cult was adopted by the Greeks and later by the Romans.
Zeus let fall in his sleep seed upon the Earth, which in course of time gave birth to an androgynous being, born both male and female, whom they called Agdistis. But the gods, fearing Agdistis, cut off the male organ. The blood fertilized the soil and there grew up from it an almond-tree. A daughter of the river Sangarius picked an almond and laid it in her bosom, where the almond disappeared. She then had a child, a baby boy named Attis.
Her orgiastic cult dominated the central and north-western districts of Asia Minor, and was introduced into Greece via the island of Samothrake and the Boiotian town of Thebes. Cybele was closely associated with a number of Greek goddesses, firstly Rhea, the Greek mother of the gods (Meter Theon), but sometimes also Demeter (especially in the Samothrakian cult), Aphrodite (on Mount Ida) and Artemis (in Karia). Her main cult followers were the Galli, these were eunuch priests of a feminine nature, who celebrated her festivals with wild dancing, self-laceration, and self-scourging.

In Anatolian mythology, Attis was the eunuch consort of the goddess Cybele. He was the son of Nana, the daughter of the river god Sangarius. Attis died after being castrated and was resurrected by Cybele. He was a god of vegetation and represented the fruits of the earth, which died in winter and grew back again in the spring. He is often shown wearing a Phrygian cap on his head. The cult of Cybele and Attis was adopted by the Greeks and later by the Romans.

Agdistis

In Anatolian, Greek and Roman mythology, Agdistis was a hermaphroditic being, and symbolized the wild and uncontrolled powers of nature. She is the personification of a mountain of the same name in Phrygia.
She was born after Zeus accidentally impregnated the earth goddess Gaia. The gods feared Agdistis because she held all the powers of creation within her body. Dionysus tricked her into castrating herself, and from then on she was known as the goddess Cybele. The blood from her severed gentials fertilized the earth, and from that spot an almond tree grew. One day the nymph Nana picked an almond from the tree, and held it against her chest, the almond vanished and she became pregnant with Attis.
Some ancient writers say Agdistis is the same as Cybele, and worshiped under that name. In many ancient inscriptions, Agdistis is clearly separate from Cybele, but in many others she is listed as an epithet of Cybele. Although primarily an Anatolian goddess, the cult of Agdistis covered a lot of territory. By 250 BC it had spread to Egypt, and later to Attica, Rhamnus around 80 BC (where there was a sanctuary of Agdistis), and later in Lesbos and Panticapeum.

Galli

The Galli (singular: Gallus) were eunuch priests of the goddess Cybele or Agdistis. They were temple attendants sometimes wandering the streets begging for charity, and in return they told people's fortunes. The Galli wore feminine clothing and grew their hair long, wearing earrings, necklaces, and heavy make-up. At festivals to Cybele and Attis they danced around wildly to loud music and whipped themselves until they bled. The newcomers to the priesthood would voluntarily castrate themselves. 
In Rome, the head of the galli was known as the Archigallus. A number of archaeological finds depict the Archigallus wearing luxurious and extravagant costumes. The Archigallus was always a Roman citizen chosen by Rome's college of priests, and the term of service lasted for life. Along with the institution of the Archigallus came the Phrygianum sanctuary and the rite of the taurobolium, two aspects of the Cybele cult which the Archigallus had responsibility, as well as presiding over the Galli priests.

Biological species concept

The biological species concept gives an explanation of how species form (speciation). A biological species is a group of individuals that can breed together (panmixia). However, they cannot breed with other groups. In other words, the group is reproductively isolated from other groups.
According to Ernst Mayr, a new species forms when an existing species splits. A similar idea had been suggested in the 19th century by Moritz Wagner. Dobzhansky described the role of reproductive isolation in the formation of new species. Once a species lives in two different areas, the geographical isolation makes breeding between the groups reduce or stop. Each group develops features which make breeding between them work less well. Eventually, each group becomes a 'good' biological species, because the two species do not reproduce with each other even when they are together.
This is still considered the most common reason for species splitting, and has the technical name of allopatric speciation. It is contrasted with sympatric speciation where speciation takes place even though all the members live in the same area.
The biological species is the main reason for classifying living things, but applying it in practice is not easy. Good examples of this are the following:
What this is saying is that, in practice, the biological species concept is not sufficient by itself to decide on the classification of animals.
In 1686 John Ray introduced a non-evolutionary biological concept. To him, species were distinguished by always producing the same species, and this was fixed and permanent, though considerable variation was possible within a species.
The idea of a species as a physical type of organism had a long history. This survives as the concept of a type specimen in taxonomy. It was the way Linnaeus worked in his binomial classification, and is still useful for amateur naturalists today. 
In the "Origin", Charles Darwin said that species were labels which experts gave on the basis of their observations.
But twenty years before, he had a much better idea. He thought of species as maintained by reproductive isolation. He even says "Hence species may be good ones and differ scarcely at all in any external character". Here he quotes the two sibling species of leaf warbler discovered in England by Gilbert White in 1768. At this early stage in his career, Darwin came very close to the modern biological species concept.
In the last 70 years two ideas have dominated the way professional biologists think about species.
The first is the population genetics concept. This is where a species is seen as a group which can mate together even though they are all to some extent different. It amounts to saying that a species is a gene pool.
The second is the use of DNA sequence analysis to show whether similar-looking species are genetically different from each other. This is especially useful when it is not practical to do breeding experiments.
Sibling species are often called cryptic (hidden) species because their differences can only be seen by analysing their DNA. They are very common in the marine environment. 
Many cryptic species exist in all habitats. In the marine bryozoan "Celleporella hyalina", DNA sequence analysis was used to show that more than ten ecologically distinct species that had been diverging for many millions of years.
Evidence from the identification of cryptic species means that older estimates of global species richness are too low. For example, mitochondrial DNA research suggests there are at least 11 genetically distinct populations of giraffes. Similarly, the Amazonian frog "Eleutherodactylus ockendeni" is at least three different species which diverged over 5 million years ago.

Kyushu-Palau Ridge (KPR) is an ocean floor feature in the Philippine Sea. It is named after the nearby islands. At the northern end is the Japanese island of Kyushu. At the southern end is the Pacific island nation of Palau.
The seabed ridge begins in an area about 900Â km from the eastern end of the or ""Bungo" strait" between the Japanese islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. The ridge creates a line on the ocean floor which runs southeast in the direction of the island of Palau. There is a chain of extinct volcanos on this line.

Seamount

A seamount is a mountain rising from the ocean sea floor. It does not reach to the water's surface (sea level), and so is not an island. These are usually formed from submarine volcanoes. They are usually 1,000â4,000 metres (3,000â13,000 ft) in height from the sea floor. 
The peaks are often found hundreds to thousands of metres below the surface, and so are in the deep sea. There are an estimated 100,000 seamounts around the globe, but only a few have been studied. Seamounts come in all shapes and sizes, and follow a distinctive pattern of growth, activity, and death. In recent years, several active seamounts have been observed, for example Loihi seamount in the HawaiianâEmperor seamount chain.
Seamounts are one of the most common oceanic ecosystems in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, and their raised position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and cetacea alike. Their effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are concerns about the effect of fishing on seamount ecosystems. There are well-documented cases of stock decline. 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling, which literally scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.
Most seamounts are not yet to be studied, or even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies used to collect data. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses. As they get older, water pressure pushes water into their sides, causing landslides that may cause massive tsunamis.
