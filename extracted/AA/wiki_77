Muhammad Ali Pasha

Muhammad Ali Pasha al-Mas'ud ibn Agha (4 March 1769 – 2 August 1849) was an Albanian commander in the Ottoman army. He became Wāli, and self-declared Khedive of Egypt and Sudan. 
Though not a modern nationalist, he was the founder of modern Egypt because of the dramatic reforms he made to the army, economy, and culture of Egypt. He also ruled some Levantine territories outside Egypt. The dynasty he established ruled Egypt and Sudan until the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.
Muhammed Ali was born in the Ottoman Empire, in the area which is now the Greek province of Macedonia. His parents were Albanian, and their language was the only one he spoke well. He also spoke some Turkish, but not Arabic. He led a group of Albanian troops sent to Egypt. They were part of an Ottoman force that reoccupied Egypt after Napoleon's French troops left. The Ottomans had ruled Egypt by a Wali (Governor) with Mamluk troops. The Mamluks were former slaves.
The French Capitulation of Alexandria left a power vacuum in the Ottoman province. Mamluk power had been weakened, but not destroyed, and Ottoman forces clashed with the Mamluks for power. During this period of anarchy Muhammad Ali used his loyal Albanian troops to play both sides, gaining power and prestige for himself. As the conflict drew on, the local populace grew weary of the power struggle. A group of prominent Egyptians demanded that the then Wāli, Ahmad Khurshid Pasha, step down and Muhammad Ali be installed as the new Wāli in 1805.
Muhammad Ali’s goal was to establish a powerful, European-style state. To do that, he had to reorganize Egyptian society, streamline the economy, train a professional bureaucracy, and build a modern military.
In practice, Muhammad Ali’s land reform amounted to a monopoly on trade in Egypt. He required all producers to sell their goods to the state. The state in turn resold Egyptian goods, and kept the surplus. This was very profitable for Egypt, especially with their cotton, which was of high quality. The new-found profits also extended down to the individual farmers, as the average wage increased fourfold.
Beyond building a more modern economy, Muhammad Ali started to train a professional military and bureaucracy. He sent promising men to Europe to study. Students were sent to study European languages, primarily French, so they could translate military manuals into Arabic. He then used both educated Egyptians and imported European experts to establish schools and hospitals in Egypt. European education also provided talented Egyptians with social mobility. Bright boys from poor families could work their way up, and become successful.
A byproduct of Muhammad Ali’s training program was the establishment of a Civil service. Establishing an efficient central bureaucracy was needed for Muhammad Ali’s other reforms. In the process of destroying the Mamluks, the Wāli had to fill the posts that the Mamluks had previously filled. He divided Egypt into ten provinces, each leader responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining order. Muhammad Ali installed his sons in most key positions; however, his reforms did offer Egyptians opportunities beyond agriculture and industry.
At the start, Muhammad Ali waged war on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan, Mahmud II, in Arabia, and Greece. Later, he came into open conflict with the Ottoman Empire.
His first military campaign was an expedition into the Arabian Peninsula. The holy cities of Mecca, and Medina had been captured by the House of Saud, who held a form of Islam called Wahhabism. Armed with their new religious zeal, the Muhammad ibn Saud began conquering parts of Arabia. 
With the main Ottoman army tied up in Europe, Mahmud II turned to Muhammad Ali to recapture the Arabian territories. Muhammad Ali in turn appointed his son, Tusun Pasha, to lead a military expedition in 1811. The campaign was turned back in Arabia; however, a second attack was launched in 1812 that recaptured Hejaz. After a two-year campaign, the Saudis were crushed and most of the Saudi family was captured. The family leader, Abdullah ibn Saud, was sent to Istanbul, and executed.
Muhammad Ali next turned his attention to military campaigns of his own design, beginning with the Sudan which he viewed as a valuable addition of territory, gold, and slaves. Sudan at the time had no real central authority and used primitive weaponry in its tribal infighting. 
In 1820 Muhammad Ali dispatched an army of 5,000 troops commanded by his third son, Ismail, south into Sudan with the intent of conquering the territory and subjugating it to his authority. Ali's troops made headway into Sudan in 1821, but met with fierce resistance. Ultimately, Egyptian troops and firearms ensured the conquest of Sudan. Ali now had an outpost from which he could expand to the source of the Nile in Ethiopia, and Uganda. His administration captured slaves from the Sudan, who were then made into a foot regiment of soldiers. Ali's harsh reign in Sudan, and that of his immediate successors, led eventually to the popular independence struggle of the self-proclaimed Mahdi, Muhammed Ahmed, in 1881. 
As Muhammad Ali was expanding his authority into Africa, the Ottoman Empire faced ethnic rebellions in its European territories. The rebellion in the Greek provinces of the Ottoman Empire began in 1821. The Ottoman army failed to put down the revolt, and ethnic violence spread as far as Constantinople. Sultan Mahmud II offered Muhammad Ali the island of Crete in exchange for his support in putting down the revolt.
Muhammed Ali sent 16,000 soldiers, 100 transports, and 63 escort vessels under command of his son, Ibrahim Pasha.. Britain, France, and Russia intervened to protect the Greeks. On 20 October 1827 at the Navarino, the entire Egyptian navy was sunk by the European Allied fleet under the command of Admiral Edward Codrington (1770–1851). Muhammad Ali suffered the loss of his competent, expensive navy. With its fleet destroyed, Egypt had no way to support its forces in Greece and was forced to withdraw. Ultimately the campaign cost Muhammad Ali his navy for no gains.
To compensate for his and Egypt's losses, the conquest of Syria was set in motion. Like other rulers of Egypt before him, Ali desired to control the Levant, both for its strategic value and for its rich natural resources. Not only had Syria abundant natural resources, it also had a thriving international trading community with well-developed markets throughout the Levant. It would be a captive market for the goods now being produced in Egypt. Perhaps best of all, Syria was desirable as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman Sultan.
A new fleet was built, a new army was raised and on 31 October 1831, under Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian invasion of Syria started the First Turko-Egyptian War. The Egyptians overran most of Syria with ease. The strongest and only really significant resistance was put up at the port city of Acre. The Egyptian force eventually captured the city after a six-month siege. Unrest on the Egyptian home front increased during the course of the siege. Ali was forced to squeeze Egypt more and more to support his campaign, and his people resented the increased burden.
After the fall of Acre, the Egyptian army marched north into Anatolia. At the Battle of Konya (21 December 1832), Ibrahim Pasha soundly defeated the Ottoman army led by the Grand Vizier Reshid Pasha. There were now no military obstacles between Ibrahim's forces and Constantinople itself.
Through the course of the campaign, Muhammad Ali watched the European powers carefully. Fearing another intervention that would reverse all his gains, he proceeded slowly and cautiously. For example, he continued the practice of using the Sultan’s name at Friday prayers in the newly captured territories. He continued to circulate Ottoman coins instead of issuing new ones bearing his likeness. So long as Muhammad Ali’s march did not threaten the complete collapse of the Ottoman state, the powers in Europe remained passive observers.
Despite this show, Muhammad Ali's goal was now to remove the current Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II and replace him with the sultan's son, the infant Abdülmecid. This possibility so alarmed Mahmud II that he accepted Russia's offer of military aid. This led to the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi. Russia's gain dismayed the British and French governments, so they worked for a negotiated solution. In May 1833 the Convention of Kutahya was signed. 
The terms of the peace were that Ali would withdraw his forces from Anatolia and receive the territories of Crete and the Hijaz as compensation. Ibrahim Pasha would be appointed Wāli of Syria. The peace agreement fell short, however, of granting Muhammad Ali an independent kingdom for himself, leaving him wanting.

George III of Great Britain and Ireland

George III (Born George William Frederick 4 June 1738 29 January 1820) was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 25 October 1760 until 1 January 1801. He was then King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until his death. He was also Elector of Hanover, making him a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire.
During George III's reign, his home country was defeated in a noble war and he lost control of the United States of America. His two kingdoms Great Britain and Ireland were merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Also during his reign Great Britain and its successor the United Kingdom were at war with republican and Napoleonic France. His land in Hanover, Germany became a Kingdom. He suffered from periodic bouts of insanity. One of these caused a Regency crisis in 1788 during which the kingdom of Ireland attempted unsuccessfully to nominate his son George IV as regent. He quickly recovered and prevented this.
George III signed the Quebec Act of 1774 abolishing William of Orange's anti-Roman Catholic laws in Great Britain's 13 North American colonies. Also during his reign George III signed legislation abolishing some of the anti-Catholic Laws in Great Britain and Ireland, such as Catholic Relief Acts of 1772 and 1774 allowing Roman Catholics to have land leases in Great Britain, and a 1793 Irish Parliament bill called Hogart's Act allowing Roman Catholics to vote in Irish elections. But he still blocked a proposal in 1800 by the British Parliament to allow Catholics to sit in Parliament.
In the later part of his life, George III suffered from recurrent, and eventually permanent, mental illness. Although it has since been suggested that he suffered from the genetic blood disease porphyria, the cause of his illness is not certain. After a final relapse in 1810, a regency was established, and George III's eldest son, George, Prince of Wales, ruled as Prince Regent. On George III's death, the Prince Regent succeeded his father as George IV.
Because of "his plain, homely, thrifty manners and tastes", George III has been nicknamed "Farmer George".

Abercrombie River

The Abercrombie River is a river in New South Wales, Australia. It flows west from Mount Werong to the Wyangala Dam near Cowra. The river is a tributary of the Lachlan, which it joins at Wyangala lake.
The Abercrombie River is in length, and passes through the Abercrombie River National Park. It provides habitat for platypus and rakali. The Goulburn-Oberon Road crosses the Abercrombie River in the steep-sided Abercrombie Gorge.
The first people to live alongside the river were Aborigines of the Wiradjuri and Gundungara tribes. They may have used the river as a trading route. The first European to discover the river was explorer Charles Throsby on 5 May 1819, during an expedition from Sydney to the Central West of New South Wales. Alluvial gold was discovered in and along the river in 1851. This started a small gold rush. It was difficult to find gold because of the rough terrain, and changing water levels in the river. Early miners found up to of gold a day along the river. By 1862 about 45 mining parties were working at Milburne Creek, a minor tributary of the Abercrombie. 
It is the furthest east of the inland flowing rivers.

Rakali

Hydromys chrysogaster, also known as Rakali or Water-rat, is an Australian native rodent. The species lives in burrows on the banks of rivers, lakes and estuaries. It feeds on aquatic insects, fish, crustaceans, mussels, snails, frogs, birds' eggs and water birds. Rakali are in length with a thick tail measuring around . They weigh . They have webbed hind legs, waterproof fur, a flattened head, a long blunt nose, many whiskers and small ears and eyes. They are black to brown in colour with an orange to white belly, and dark tail with a white tip.
Until the 1980s, this species was commonly known as Water-rat. During the 1990s there was a push for English common names to be replaced with indigenous names. In 1995 the Australian Nature Conservation Agency recommended that the name Rakali be used as the common name. The Australian Department of Environment and Heritage has taken up this suggestion and both common names are now used.

The Battle of White Mountain in 1620, was the first battle of the Thirty Years War. Duke Maximilian I of Bavaria defeated the forces of Frederick V, Elector of Palantine, King of Bohemia and Moravia. 
The cause of the battle was a revolt by a group of Czech lords who threw two governors and a secretary out of the windows of Prague Castle. This incident is known as the Defenestration of Prague. They quickly built up an army of 30,000 to make an independent Protestant country. The Czechs were defeated by a well trained Imperial army, the battle lasting less than one hour. Emperor Ferdinand II replaced Frederick as King of Bohemia, and then killed many who had opposed him. Others were given a choice, convert to Catholicism or leave the country.
White Mountain is now in the city of Prague. There is an open space and monument.

Gansus

Gansus is a genus of aquatic birds that lived during the Lower Cretaceous period, between 115 to 105 million years ago (mya). It was found in what is now Gansu province, western China. It is the oldest-known of the Ornithurae, the group which includes modern birds (Neornithes) and extinct related groups, such as "Confuciusornis", "Ichthyornis" and "Hesperornis".
The genus "Gansus" contains a single species, "G. yumenensis", which was about the size of a pigeon and similar in appearance to loons and diving ducks.
"Gansus" was discovered in the form of a single fossil foot in 1981. Five more well-preserved fossils were found in 2003–2004 in mudstone at the site of an ancient lake at Changma, Gansu; the geological stratum in which the fossils were found is the Xiagou Formation. Their bodies had settled in anoxic mud and were soon covered with further extremely fine silty sediments. Without oxygen, their remains resisted decay: these specimens preserved remains of flight feathers and traces of the webbing between their toes.

This City

This City is the first solo mainstream radio single released by American pop singer-songwriter Patrick Stump off the debut album "Soul Punk" under Island Def Jam Records on July 26, 2011 on his blog. The song features American rapper and songwriter and producer Lupe Fiasco. The original track does not feature Fiasco's addition to the rap versus in the single. In January 2010, Stump announced that he was producing his debut solo album, titled "Soul Punk". This came after Fall Out Boy (his main band)'s hiatus in late 2009. His album is a complete solo effort as he is doing everything: performing, composing all music, penning all lyrics, playing over ten instruments and producing, with the album's recording is funded by his own Fall Out Boy earnings. Its musical direction is generally pop/R&B orientated and has been described by Stump as "soul punk" and "smart pop," drawing influence from a wide scope of artists including Prince, Michael Jackson and David Bowie. According to Stump, the song changed the entire course of "Soul Punk". "I had written a while draft of the album and then at the 11th hour came up with "This City," I really loved the song but felt like, conceptually, it didn't fit on the album. I had to go back and make an album for that song because I loved it so much. So one of the holdups on [the album] was re-writing the record around [it]." With "Soul Punk" originally due in February 2011, Stump delayed it to October 18 and rebuilt the album with the song, releasing "Truant Wave" EP in the meanwhile for its delay in February 2011. "I had this feeling that the album was disjointed, and right before I was mastering, I played "This City" for my manager — I really liked it, but I was unsure about it, although I thought it was what I wanted to say — and he was like, 'Put it on, it's great! Then I thought, 'Well, if I'm going to put that on the record, then I really need to go back to the drawing board.' Basically I took "This City", "Everybody Wants Somebody", "Allie", and a song called "Dance Miserable", and rebuilt the album around those four songs."
A music video for the remix has been released, directed by Ken Koller. On September 13, Patrick Stump announced that the music video for "This City" (remix) would premiere on September 20 on Vevo with a teaser on Idolitor. Prior to that he Tweeted about the video in the making Twitter and a behind-the-scenes clip was reported by MTV on their website. The video features Stump dancing and performing the song in a room with flashing lights, projections and heavy use of special effects, alternating with brief grayscale flashes of a city. Despite not being available at first, Lupe Fiasco appears for one scene by himself. Stump and Koller made the video simplistic to let the music do the talking rather than the video.
"There's not really a plot, there's not really a story to it. The song's called 'This City,' and it describes a lot of these images in a city, and I feel like those images are already there; it would be kind of redundant to take a camera into a city; it's almost like the colors and the lights and the images that are going to be around this are going to be representing the life in a city. One thing that Ken and I were talking about is that a city is so complicated, so ... we wanted to do something a bit different with it, and a bit more abstract [...] the treatment was really funny to look at; it was literally one sentence, like 'Patrick stands in a room and sings and we project all these images and lights on the walls.'"—Stump, reported by MTV.

Field Marshal Horatio Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener KG, KP, GCB, OM, GCSI, GCMG, GCIE, ADC, PC (24 June 1850 – 4 June 1916) was an Irish born British Field Marshal.
Kitchener was Sirdar (British Commander in Chief) of the Egyptian Army. He defeated the Mahdist rebels against Egyptian rule in 1898 and conquered the Sudan for Britain and (nominally) Egypt.
He was Chief of Staff during the Boer War of 1899-1902. From 1899-1900 he was also Commander-in-Chief of the forces in southern Africa. He was given many orders of chivalry, both British and foreign, including Knight of St. Patrick and Knight of the Garter.
At the start of the First World War, the Prime Minister, Asquith, quickly appointed Lord Kitchener Secretary of State for War. A massive recruitment campaign began, featuring his image in a famous advertisement. Kitchener was drowned in 1916 when the HMS Hampshire sunk near the Orkney Islands after hitting a German mine.

Anglo-Egyptian Sudan

Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was the name of the Sudan when it was a colony of the United Kingdom and Egypt. It was officially under the joint rule of both countries, but really the British controlled the government from the beginning. Every Governor was British, and all decisions about the country were made by the British, although many of the administrators of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan were Egyptians. The Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was created in 1899 when the Egyptian Army under Herbert Kitchener recaptured the Sudan, which was before an Egyptian colony, from the Madhists, a group of Islamic rebels against Egypt.

Neornithes

The Neornithes are the modern birds. These are the most recent common ancestor of all living birds and all its descendants. There are about 9 to 10,000 known living bird species in the world.
Modern birds are divided into two superorders; the Palaeognathae (tinamous and flightless ratites), and the Neognathae, containing all other birds. 
It is generally agreed that the Neornithes evolved in the Cretaceous and that the split between the Palaeognathae and Neognathae, and then the split between fowl and the other Neognathae, occurred before the K/T extinction event. The earliest fossil remains of the Neornithes might be about ten million years after the start of the Cretaceous. "Gallornis" may be the first fossil, but its remains are only a worn partial femur and a fragment of the humerus. 
There are different opinions about whether the radiation of the remaining neognathes occurred before or after the extinction of the other dinosaurs. Molecular dating suggests a Cretaceous radiation, while fossil evidence suggest an early Tertiary radiation. Attempts made to bring together the molecular and fossil evidence have proved controversial.
The classification of modern birds is difficult. Sibley & Ahlquist's "Phylogeny and classification of birds" (1990) is a landmark work on the classification of birds, though it is often debated and revised. Most evidence suggests that the modern bird orders are accurate taxa. More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.

Palaeognathae

The Palaeognathae or paleognaths are one of the two living superorders of birds. The other living superorder is Neognathae. Together these two clades form the subclass Neornithes.
Paleognath is a word derived from the ancient Greek for "old jaws" in reference to the skeletal anatomy of the palate, which is described as more primitive and reptilian than that in other birds. Paleognathous birds are uncontroversially the most primitive, or basal, living birds, though there is some controversy about the precise relationship between them and the other birds. 
This superorder contains four extant orders of flightless ratites and one order of flying tinamous;
The order Tinamiformes (tinamous) includes nine living genera and forty-seven species.
The Apterygiformes (kiwis) include five species in one genus ("Apteryx").
The Casuariiformes have two genera. The cassowaries ("Casuarius") have three species and the emus (Dromaius) have one living and one recently extinct species.
The Rheiformes (rheas) have two genera with one species each.
The Struthioniformes (ostriches) have only one living species.
There are extinct orders: the Lithornithiformes, the Dinornithiformes (moas), and the Aepyornithiformes (elephant birds). There are other extinct orders which have been allied with the Palaeognathae by at least one author, but their affinities are a matter of dispute: the Ambiornithiformes, the Gansuiformes, the Paleocursornithiformes, the Gobipterygidae.
These are the families of running-birds:

Neognathae

Neognaths are birds in the subclass Neornithes. The Neognathae include almost all living birds: their sister taxon Palaeognathae has just the tinamou and the flightless ratites.
There are nearly 10,000 species of neognaths. Since the Cretaceous they have undergone an adaptive radiation. This has produced the variety of form, function, and behavior which we see today. The Passeriformes (perching birds) are the largest order of land vertebrates. They are some 60% of living birds.
The neognaths have fused hand bones, an elongate third finger, and 13 or fewer vertebrae. They differ from the Palaeognathae in features like the structure of their jawbones. "Neognathae" means "new jaws" but, ironically, paleognath jaws are one of the few derived) features of that group.

Officially, the movement wanted to create a free secular Sudan, which it called "New Sudan". In reality, however, many people in the movement wanted to create an independent state, South Sudan. In 2005, there was a peace treaty. From that moment, until 2011, the SPLM was part of the Sudanese government. Since the independence of South Sudan in 2011, the SPLM is de facto the only party in the country. In the south, the SPLA will become the regular army.

Human swimming

Swimming is the movement of the body through water using arms and legs. Most of the time equipment is not used. People swim for exercise, fun.and they can swim competitively.
People swim using their arms and/or legs. There are several "strokes": "breaststroke", "front crawl", "butterfly", and "backstroke" are some of them. The main stroke usually is front crawl, but many people prefer breaststroke because it is relaxing.
Swimming can be done for competitive sport. Many schools use swimming as a physical training exercise. 
People can swim in the sea, swimming pools, rivers and lakes. 
Swimming has been around for a long time. Humans learned how to swim from the sea creatures. When they started swimming, they could swim as well and fast as today. 
Swimming works all the muscles simultaneously. It is impact free.
Competitive swimming became popular in the nineteenth century. The goal of competitive swimming is to constantly improve upon one's time(s), or to beat the competitors in any given event. However, some professional swimmers who do not hold a national or world ranking are considered the best in regard to their technical skills. Typically, an athlete goes through a cycle of training in which the body is overloaded with work in the beginning and middle segments of the cycle. The workload is decreased in the final stage as the swimmer approaches the competition in which he or she is to compete in. This final stage is often referred to as "shave and taper"; the swimmer tapering downs his or her workload to be able to perform at their optimal level. At the very end of this stage, before competition, the swimmer shaves off all exposed hair for the sake of reducing drag and having a sleeker and more hydrodynamic feel in the water. Women who are menstruating may use tampons rather than pads.
There are several styles in swimming. Some of them are:

Biological control

Biological control, or biological pest control, is the reduction of pest populations by using natural enemies. It is important because crop pests become resistant to chemical pesticides.
Natural enemies of insect pests include predators, parasitoids, and pathogens. Biological control agents of weeds include herbivores and plant pathogens. Predators, such as birds, lady beetles and lacewings, are free-living species that eat many prey during their lifetime. 
Parasitoids are species whose larvae develop on or in a single insect host, ultimately killing or fatally infecting the host. Most have a very narrow host range. Many species of wasps and some flies are parasitoids. 
Pathogens are disease-causing organisms including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They kill or debilitate their host and are relatively specific.
There are three basic types of biological control strategies; conservation, classical biological control, and augmentation.
A Chinese text from 304 AD, "Records of the plants and trees of the southern regions", by Hsi Han, describes mandarin oranges protected by large reddish-yellow citrus ants. The ants attack and kill insect pests of the orange trees. The citrus ant ("Oecophylla smaragdina") was rediscovered in the 20th century, and now is again used in China to protect orange groves.

Auld Alliance

The Auld Alliance (Scots) () was an alliance between the kingdoms of Scotland and France. It played a major role in the relations between Scotland, France and England from its beginning in 1295 until the 1560 Treaty of Edinburgh. The alliance was renewed by all the French and Scottish monarchs of that period except for Louis XI. By the late 14th century, the treaty was renewed even in France or Scotland was not at war with England.
The alliance dates from the treaty signed by John Balliol and Philip IV of France in 1295 against Edward I of England. The terms of the treaty said that if either country was attacked by England, the other country would invade England. This happened at the Battle of Flodden Field, 1513. The alliance played an important role in conflicts between both countries and England, such as the Wars of Scottish Independence, the Hundred Years' War, the War of the League of Cambrai and the Rough Wooing.
In a speech which he delivered in Edinburgh in June 1942, Charles de Gaulle described the alliance between Scotland and France as "the oldest alliance in the world". He also declared that:
"In every combat where for five centuries the destiny of France was at stake, there were always men of Scotland to fight side by side with men of France, and what Frenchmen feel is that no people has ever been more generous than yours with its friendship."
In 1995, celebrations were held in both countries for the 700th anniversary of the beginning of the alliance.

Sosigenes the Peripatetic

Sosigenes the Peripatetic was a philosopher who lived in the 2nd century AD. He followed the Aristotelian school of thought, and was one of the first people to write interpretations and commentaries to Aristotle's work. 
He was the tutor of Alexander of Aphrodisias, and wrote a work "On Revolving Spheres". On 4th September 164 AD, he watched an 'annular' solar eclipse. He noticed that, unlike a total solar eclipse, the apparent size of the moon was smaller than that of the sun. This meant the distances between the sun, moon and earth were not the same at different eclipses. For this reason, sun and moon could not be on a circular movement around the same centre. 
This was a significant discovery. It pinpointed a difficulty with the theory that the earth was the centre of the known universe. Much later, Nicolaus Copernicus used the same idea when he proposed a heliocentric view. In this view, the earth, moon and the planets rotate around the sun, which does not move.

Lacewing

Lacewings, or 'Green lacewings', are insects in the large family Chrysopidae of the order Neuroptera. There are about 85 genera and (differing between sources) 1,300–2,000 species in this widespread group. However, in America and Europe, the two genera "Chrysopa" and "Chrysoperla" are very common.
Most species of lacewings and their larvae are active predators, and are often used for biological control. 
Many adults of "Chrysopa" can defend themselves by giving out a vile smell from glands at the front of their thorax.
They have 'ears' at the base of their front wings. When they hear bat echolocation sounds, they close their wings and drop down. They can escape spider webs, because, being so light, they do not create much vibration to alert the spider. Instead of struggling like most insects, the lacewing bites through the strands holding its legs and antennae. When it is stuck only by its wings, it become completely immobile. Slowly, the lacewing slides downwards out of the web. Tiny hairs on the wings prevent the sticky spider silk from touching the wings' surface. 
The larvae are voracious, attacking other insects of suitable size, especially soft-bodied ones (aphids, caterpillars and other insect larvae, insect eggs). When they touch a potential prey object, the larva grasps it. Their maxillae are hollow, and inject a digestive secretion into the prey. The organs of an aphid can be dissolved by this in 90 seconds.

Pre-frontal cortex

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the front part of the frontal lobes of the brain. It lies in front of the motor and premotor areas.
This brain region helps plan complex cognitive behaviours, personality expression, and decision making. It helps correct social behaviour. The basic activity of this brain region is to bring together thoughts and actions to help achieve internal goals.
The most typical psychological term for functions carried out by the prefrontal cortex area is executive function. This is the ability to work out conflicting thoughts. It determines good and bad, better and best, same and different, consequences of current activities, working toward a goal, prediction of outcomes, and expectation of results. Critical is 'social control': the ability to suppress urges which, if not suppressed, could lead to socially unacceptable outcomes.
Many authors have indicated an integral link between a person's personality and the functions of the prefrontal cortex.

It is considered one of the 100 worst invasive species in the world. Infestations are difficult to control because of the insect's ability to survive without food for long periods, its preference for dry conditions and low-moisture food, and its resistance to many insecticides. There is a federal quarantine restricting the importation of rice into the U.S. from countries with known infestations of the beetle.

The full name of the exam is the "Test of English for International Communication". The Educational Testing Service (ETS) writes and gives the test.
The Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) is meant to measure English skills in everyday workplace activities.
The TOEIC Listening & Reading Test is a two-hour multiple-choice test. It has 200 questions. One hundred questions test listening comprehension, and the other 100 test reading comprehension. Test takers get separate scores for listening and reading on from 5 to 495 points. The total score adds up to from 10 to 990 points. The TOEIC certificate comes in five colors based on the scores:

The TOEIC Speaking Test takes about 20 minutes. The TOEIC Writing Test lasts about 60 minutes. Each test has a score between 0-200.
Nearly 1.5 million people take the TOEIC each year in Japan. The offers the test in Japan. There are two ways to take the TOEIC test. One is the TOEIC Secure Program (SP), the other is the TOEIC Institutional Testing Program (ITP). The SP is offered at a set place and time, and test takers go there for the exam. In the ITP, a group such as a university gives the test when and where they like. Groups giving the ITP test must follow the test rules.
The Institute for International Business Communication had a scandal in 2009.
The IIBC’s 92 year-old Chairman Yaeji Watanabe made his girlfriend's son Chairman of the IIBC Board of Directors. Watanabe forced out half the board of directors. Also, Watanabe only worked about one day a week. Watanabe's salary was more than 25 million yen each year. Watanabe said he was Chairman in name only and had little to do with choosing the new chairman. Then, Watanabe suddenly quit the IIBC. The son of his girlfriend was in charge of the non-profit company. The IIBC paid Watanabe 25 million yen for his retirement.
The IIBC lowered the price of the TOEIC Secure Program Test from 6,615 yen to 5,985 yen from September 13, 2009. Ministry of Trade asked the IIBC to lower the price because the test was making too much money.
IIBC has a for-profit partner company called International Communications School (ICS). In July 2010, the Tokyo Tax Bureau announced that ICS lied about 100 million yen in income. ICS had to pay 30 million yen in taxes and fines.
South Korea is the second largest user of TOEIC by population. But, some major corporations have stopped using TOEIC scores for employment, or have required lower scores.
From 2011, Korean universities were no longer allowed to use TOEIC and TOEFL scores as part of the selecting students. Seoul National University has developed another English proficiency test, TEPS. It may replace TOEIC.
In France, some Grandes écoles require a TOEIC score of at least 785 for a diploma. Some people think this is wrong because it means a diploma from a state school depends on a private corporation. The "Commission des titres d'ingénieur" set the 785 score as similar to a B2+ level on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.
Student who cannot score 785 may have to show their English language ability in some other way. Some schools allow one more year after the end of studies to complete the diploma.
In Greece, TOEIC is accepted by ASEP as part of hiring new government workers.
TOEIC is used by some universities in Italy. All universities require that students pass an English examination before entering a degree courses or receiving diplomas. Students usually need a TOEIC score of 600 to earn a diploma. Many universities allow other tests such as the Cambridge certificate and TOEFL.
TOEIC Bridge is a simpler version of the TOEIC test. This test is for beginning and intermediate speakers. It has 100 multiple-choice questions. The test lasts about one hour.

Lady Macbeth

Lady Macbeth is a fictional character in William Shakespeare's play "Macbeth" (c.1603–1607). She is the wife to the play's main character, Macbeth, a Scottish nobleman. After talking him into killing the king, she becomes Queen of Scotland. Later, she feels bad about her part in the crime. She dies off-stage in the last act. This is thought to be suicide.
The idea for the character came from Kings Duff and Duncan in "Holinshed's Chronicles" (1587), a history of Britain familiar to Shakespeare. Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth appears to be made up of two personalities in Holinshed's work. These are Donwald's nagging, murderous wife in the account of King Duff and Macbeth's ambitious wife in the account of King Duncan.

The last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Puyi, who was living in exile in Tianjin was invited by the Japanese to accept the throne of the new Empire of Manchukuo, which was controlled by the Japanese army. In January 1933, to guard Manchukuo’s southern borders, a joint Japanese and Manchukuo force invaded Rehe, and after conquering that province by March, drove the remaining Chinese armies in the northeast outside the Great Wall into Hebei Province.
The Western powers blamed Japan's actions but did little else. When the League of Nations demanded that Japan stop fighting, the Japan withdrew from the League on March 27, 1933.
As the Japanese army was under clear orders from Emperor Hirohito (who wanted a quick end to the fight with China) not to go into the Great Wall, the Japanese halted their attack in May 1933.
On May 22, 1933, Chinese and Japanese representatives met to talk the end of the fight. The Japanese demands were serious: a demilitarized zone covering one hundred kilometers south of the Great Wall, from Beijing to Tianjin was to be set up, with the Great Wall itself under Japanese control. No regular Kuomintang military units were to be allowed in the zone, although the Japanese were allowed to use scout aircraft or ground patrols to check that the agreement was maintained. Public order within the zone was to be maintained by a police unit Demilitarized Zone Peace Preservation Corps.
Two secret clauses left out any of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies from this Peace Preservation Corps and provided for any problems that could not be fixed by the Peace Preservation Corps to be arranged by agreement between the Japanese and Chinese governments. Having lost every major battles and much territory, and with the Chinese government under Chiang Kai-shek more concerned with fighting the Chinese Communist Party than the Japanese, the Chinese government agreed to all demands. Furthermore, the new demilitarized zone was mostly within the remaining territory of the Manchurian warlord Zhang Xueliang.
The Tanggu Truce resulted in the "de facto" recognition of Manchukuo by the Kuomingtang government, and acceptance of the loss of Rehe. It brought a short end to the combat between China and Japan and for a brief period, relations between the two countries improved. On May 17, 1935, the Japanese legation in China was improved to the status of , and on June 10, 1935, the He-Umezu Agreement was concluded. The Tanggu Truce gave Chiang kai Shek time to merge his forces and to focus his efforts against the Chinese Communist Party, though at the cost of northern China. However, Chinese public opinion was opposing to truce so favorable to Japan and so shameful to China. Although the Truce set up a demilitarized buffer zone, Japanese territorial desires towards China remained, and the Truce proved to be only a short break until fightings broke out again with the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937.

Mukden Incident

The Mukden Incident, also known as the Manchurian Incident, was an event set up by Japanese soldiers as a reason for invading the northern part of China known as Manchuria in 1931.
On September 18, 1931, a little amount of dynamite was blown up by a Japanese soldier near Japan's South Manchuria Railway near Mukden. Although the explosion was so weak that the rail was still usable, the Japanese army, blaming the action on the Chinese people, fully invaded Manchuria, leading to its occupation. Japan set up its puppet state of Manchukuo six months later. Soon the world knew the event, leading Japan to diplomatic isolation and its withdrawal from the League of Nations.

Sensory receptor

A sensory receptor, or sense organ, is the part which responds to a stimulus in the internal or external environment of an organism. It is the input to the sensory system. In response to stimuli the sensory receptor fires off a nerve fibre which goes to the central nervous system.

Parietal lobe

The parietal lobe is a part of the brain positioned above the occipital lobe and behind the frontal lobe. 
The parietal lobe brings together information from different senses, particularly spatial sense and navigation. For example, it uses input about touch, balance and the visual system. This enables the parietal cortex to map seen objects in relation to the body (into 'body coordinate positions'). This makes it possible for a person to reach out and handle objects.
The name derives from the overlying parietal bone, which is named from the Latin "pariet-", = 'wall'.

<doc id="314487" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314487" title="Frontal lobe">
Frontal lobe

The frontal lobe is an area in the brain of humans and other mammals, at the front of each cerebral hemisphere. It is in front of the parietal lobe and above and in front of the temporal lobes. 
The frontal lobes takes action based on sensory information (sight, sound, touch) from the three rear areas of the cerebrum. The action is moderated by the influence of the pre-frontal cortex. The system is a delicate balance between the need to satisfy urges from the most ancient parts of the brain, such as hunger, self-defence and sex, with the need to act in a way which is socially acceptable. 
The precentral gyrus, forming the back of the frontal lobe, contains the primary motor cortex. This controls voluntary movements of specific body parts.
For many years, many scientists thought that the frontal lobe was comparatively larger in humans than in other primates. They thought that this was an important feature of human evolution and was the main reason why human cognition is different from that of the other primates. 
However, this view has been challenged by later research. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to find the volume of the frontal cortex in humans, all living ape species and several monkey species. The human frontal cortex is "not" relatively larger than the cortex in the other great apes, but it is relatively larger than the frontal cortex in the lesser apes and the monkeys.

Temporal lobe

The temporal lobe is a region of the cerebral cortex that is under the Sylvian fissure on both cerebral hemispheres of the mammalian brain.
The temporal lobe is involved in auditory perception and is home to the primary auditory cortex. It is also important for the processing of semantics (meaning) in both speech and vision. The temporal lobe contains the hippocampus and plays a key role in the formation of long-term memory.
An area in the Sylvian fissure is the first place where auditory signals from the cochlea reach the cerebral cortex. This part of the cortex (primary auditory cortex) is involved in hearing. Other areas of the temporal lobes are involved in high-level auditory processing. In humans this includes speech, for which the left temporal lobe in particular seems to be specialized. Wernicke's area, which spans the region between temporal and parietal lobes, plays a key role (with Broca's area, which is in the frontal lobe). The functions of the left temporal lobe extends to comprehension, naming, verbal memory and other language functions. 
The underside of the temporal lobes do high-level visual processing of faces and scenes. Front parts of this area are involved in object perception and recognition.
Deep inside the medial temporal lobes lie the hippocampus, which is essential for memory function – particularly the transfer from short to long term memory and control of spatial memory and behaviour.

Super Size Me

Super Size Me is a 2004 American documentary movie directed by and starring Morgan Spurlock. It is about an experiment where Spurlock ate nothing but food from McDonald's for thirty days. He ate at McDonald's three times a day, eating an average of 5,000 kcal per day. This experiment lasted from February 1 to March 2, 2003. This experiment was bad for his own physical and psychological health. 
During the experiment, Spurlock gained 24½ lbs., had a 13% body mass increase, his cholesterol level went to 230, and he had mood swings, sexual dysfunction, and had fat accumulation in his liver. After the experiment, he recovered with a vegan diet his then-future wife All Saints singer Natalie Appleton. 
This experiment was conducted because of the obesity epidemic in the United States, and because of a case in which two teenage girls sued McDonald's who claimed they became obese as a result of eating food from McDonald's.
Spurlock also uses this movie to criticize McDonald's and the fast food industry, ranging from the sale of unhealthy food to corporate marketing and to the personal profit of these organizations.

Non-Newtonian fluid

A non-newtonian fluid is a thixotropic fluid which changes its viscosity when the forces on it change.
Other flow properties may also be affected. Most commonly viscosity of such fluids is not independent of the shear rate or the shear rate history. Examples of such fluids are blood, quicksand and certain components of cement. Many lubricants, ketchup, certain forms of dough and pudding also have this property. 
The other kind of fluids that do not show this behaviour are called Newtonian fluids.
It is very fun and easy to make your own Non-Newtonian fluid. There are many websites that show different recipes, such as cornflour mixed with water.

Newtonian fluid

A Newtonian fluid is a fluid, where the ratio between shear stress changes linearly in proportion to the stress it is exposed to. This proportion is known as viscosity. Note that the inverse is not true; there are fluids with constant viscosity, that are Non-Newtonian fluids: one example is the Boger fluid.

Schengen Area

The Schengen Area is an area that includes 26 European countries. All of those countries have signed the Schengen Agreement in Schengen, Luxembourg in 1985. 
The Schengen area removes passport control between its member countries. This means travellers who go from one Schengen country to another do not clear immigration checks anymore. Passengers go through immigration checks if they enter or exit the Schengen Area. 
The current members of the Schengen Area are Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Because Switzerland is not part of the European Economic Area, customs control in Switzerland still exists. 
At this moment, 400 million people live in the area. It is 4,312,099 square kilometres big.
On 14 June 1985 the Schengen Agreement was signed. This happened on the boat "Princess Marie-Astrid" in the middle of the river Moselle. On that place, the borders of France, Germany and Luxembourg meet. Five countries signed the Agreement: Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands and West Germany. It was signed, but that didn't mean it was already implemented.
In 26 March 1995, all European Union members (except the United Kingdom and Ireland) signed the Agreement. Norway and Iceland also signed the Agreement. 
On 1 May 2004, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia joined the EU. They signed the Schengen agreement on that same day. They implemented the Schengen Agreement on 21 December 2007.
Switzerland joined the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008. Liechtenstein joined it on 19 December 2011.
Twenty-six countries belong to the Schengen Area. All these countries are members of the European Union, except Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.
Some nationalities need visas to visit the Schengen Area. They only need one Schengen visa for all countries. But they must apply at the embassy of their main destination. The main destination is where a traveller wants to spend the longest time. The visa officer can issue a visa for only one trip or many trips. The officer also decides how long the visa is valid for. The traveller needs to exit before the Schengen visa expires. 
Travellers who do not need a Schengen visa can stay for up to 90 days in a 180-day period.

<doc id="314556" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314556" title="Undergraduate education">
Undergraduate education

Undergraduate education is a level of education wherein a student completes their first degree. The first degree of an undergraduate degree is normally named a bachelor's degree. Therefore, for many subjects in many systems of education, undergraduate education is between secondary education and a bachelor's degree. This education usually takes place in a university. In the United States, a person starting at a university is known as undergraduate while students who have higher degrees are known as graduate students. In some other educational systems and subjects, undergraduate education is between secondary education and a master's degree, for example in some science and engineering courses in Britain and some medicine courses in Europe.
In Brazil, it normally takes four or five years to complete an "undergraduate" degree. Students need to choose their main subjects before they join the university by taking a test named a "vestibular".
Undergraduate degrees are not like in the United States where students have general studies during the first years and only specialize in a "major" during the last years of college. European students enroll in a specific course of studies they want to do from the start. They are expected to have received a good general education already in the secondary level in a school (like a gymnasium or lycée). In many countries they go to university at 18 or 17. The degree normally takes four or five years. After completing the first degree students can move on to doctoral studies. In many countries, the English distinction between a bachelor's and master's degree is only now being introduced by the Bologna process. This means that the old first degree would be approximately equal to a master's degree in the US or the UK.
In the United Kingdom, undergraduate normally means students studying to get a Bachelor's degree. It is also called an award. Getting a bachelor's degree normally takes three years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, it takes four years to obtain what is known as an "ordinary" degree, and five years to obtain a Scottish master's degree. Some undergraduates in England do a master's degree as their first degree in a similar manner to Scotland. The first three years are spent attaining a bachelor's degree and the last year includes research and more difficult subjects. In England, this is more common for degrees in science and engineering.
The only universities where it is possible to receive a master's degree without even attending the university beyond the award of the bachelor's degree are Oxford and Cambridge. Master's are generally awarded to Oxford and Cambridge graduates a year after they have graduated with bachelor's degrees.
In Ireland, undergraduate study is like in the United Kingdom. It is like this because undergraduate education was first taught the same in both countries. In Ireland, the undergraduate degree is closest to the Scottish type in the United Kingdom. They are four year undergraduate programmes.
In India, it takes 3 years to complete the undergraduate course (other than engineering, law and medicine). There are two types of undergraduate courses. Arts and Science is the first one which takes 3 years to complete the courses. Another one is Engineering, this will take 4 years to complete the courses (B.E/B.TECH).
In the United States most undergraduate education is done at colleges or universities. Undergraduate education gives a bachelor's degree. This usually takes four years of study, although some courses take five years.
In the United States students in different years are often given different names:
Some students choose to attend a community college or junior college for two years beforehand to further study at another college or university.
Most universities also offer graduate study. Some institutions (e.g. liberal-arts colleges) only give undergraduate education or only give a small number another level of education. Getting an undergraduate degrees normally needs many courses to be completed. The courses have different subjects and different levels of difficulty. The academic discipline of the most number of subjects taken is called a "major" or concentration.
Unlike in the British model, degrees in law and medicine are not offered at the undergraduate level and are completed as graduate study after earning a bachelor's degree. Neither field specifies or prefers any undergraduate major, though medicine has set prerequisite courses that must be taken before enrollment. However, nursing is taught as an undergraduate program.

<doc id="314567" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314567" title="Thixotropy">
Thixotropy

Thixotropy is the property of certain gels or fluids that are thick (viscous) under normal conditions, but flow (become thin, less viscous) when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.
In more technical language:
some Non-Newtonian fluids show a change in viscosity; the longer the fluid undergoes shear stress, the lower its viscosity. A thixotropic fluid is a fluid which takes a finite time to attain equilibrium viscosity when introduced to a step change in shear rate. Many gels and colloids are thixotropic materials, exhibiting a stable form at rest but becoming fluid when agitated. 
Some fluids are anti-thixotropic: constant shear stress for a time causes an increase in viscosity or even solidification. Constant shear stress can be applied by shaking or mixing. They are much less common.
It is a common experience walking on sand that in places it liquifies as one walks on it. This is a thixotropic response to pressure. In extremes, a quicksand may be danger to man and animals.
Some clays are thixotropic, and their behaviour is of great importance in structural and geotechnical engineering. Landslides, such as those common in the cliffs around Lyme Regis, Dorset and in the Aberfan disaster in Wales are evidence of this. Similarly, a lahar is a mass of earth liquefied by a volcanic event, which rapidly solidifies once coming to rest. 
Drilling muds used in geotechnical applications can be thixotropic. Honey from honey bees may also exhibit this property under certain conditions.(Heather honey). 
Another example of a thixotropic fluid is the synovial fluid found in joints between some bones.
Some clay deposits found in the process of exploring caves exhibit thixotropism: an initially solid-seeming mudbank will turn soupy and yield up moisture when dug into or otherwise disturbed. These clays were deposited in the past by low-velocity streams which tend to deposit fine-grained sediment.
These properties are often used in commercial products which are applied to surfaces, such as paint or toothpaste. With paint, the fluidity vanishes quickly and the surface sets permanently as water (or oil) evaporates.

Coke (fuel)

Coke is a fuel used mainly in blast furnaces to reduce iron oxide to produce iron. It contains carbon, and is similar to coal. It is made from coal by cooking out things that are not carbon.
Volatile parts of the coal, such as water, gas, and tar, are driven off by baking. This is done in an airless furnace or oven (kiln) at temperatures as high as but usually around .
Coke is used as a fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace. The carbon monoxide produced by its combustion reduces iron oxide (hematite) to the iron product.
Although coke is more expensive than coal, it can be used in households as a clean fuel, relatively free of smoke and impurities. At the present day its use in domestic heating has been less than oil or gas, but in the 20th century it was often used in kitchen stoves.

Squad automatic weapon

A squad automatic weapon (SAW, also known as section automatic weapon or light support weapon) is a weapon used to give infantry squads or sections automatic firepower that can easily be moved around. Weapons used for this are selective fire rifles. They usually have a bipod and a heavier barrel so that they can be used as light machine guns. SAWs usually fire the same cartridge as the assault rifles or battle rifles used by other people in the squad/section. This makes logistics easier because only one type of ammunition needs to be given to a unit. SAWs are light enough to be used by one man. However, heavy machine guns such as the Browning M2 are more powerful but need a crew to be as effective as they can be.
Many SAWs (such as the RPK and L86) are just assault rifles or battle rifles that have been changed. They may be able to carry more ammunition and will almost always have a bipod. In the case of some assault rifles, such as the H&K G36 or Steyr AUG, the SAW is simply the usual rifle with a few parts changed. However, the Austrian Army, who uses the most Steyr AUGs, doesn't use the HBAR (heavy barrel) version of the assault rifle. Instead, they use the MG 74, which is a gun which was made from the design of the German WW2-machine gun MG 42. One of the first weapons designed for this role was the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle. Even though it could not carry many bullets in its magazine, it was still better than the usual infantry rifle.

Sign (mathematics)

In mathematics, the word sign refers to the property of being positive or negative. Every real number (that is not zero) is either positive or negative, and therefore has a sign. Zero itself is without a sign, or signless. In addition to putting signs in to real numbers, the word sign is used throughout mathematics to indicate parts of mathematical objects that mean positivity and negativity. Usually, if numbers are seen without a sign, they are seen as a positive number.
The word sign is also sometimes used to refer to various mathematical signs, such as the plus and minus signs and the multiplication sign.
A real number is said to be positive if it is greater than zero, and negative if it is less than zero. The attribute of being positive or negative is called the sign of the number. Zero itself is not considered to have a sign.
In arithmetic, the sign of a number is often denoted by placing a plus or minus sign before the number. For example, +3 would denote a positive 3, and −3 would denote a negative 3. When no plus or minus sign is given, the main way of seeing it is that a number is positive.
The sign of any number that is not zero can be changed to positive using the absolute value function. For example, the absolute value of −3 and the absolute value of 3 are both equal to 3. In symbols, this would be written |−3| = 3 and |3| = 3.
The number zero is neither positive nor negative, and therefore has no sign. In arithmetic, +0 and −0 both mean the same number 0.
Because zero is neither positive nor negative, the following are sometimes used to refer to the sign of an unknown number:
Thus a non-negative number is either positive or zero, while a non-positive number is either negative or zero. For example, the absolute value of a real number is always non-negative, but is not necessarily positive.
The same definition is sometimes used for functions that take real or integer values. For example, a function would be called positive if all of its values are positive, or non-negative if all of its values are non-negative.
In many texts, it is common to see a sign together with the measure of an angle, particularly a located angle or an angle of rotation. In such a situation, the sign says whether the angle is in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Though different conventions can be used, it is common in mathematics to have counterclockwise angles count as positive, and clockwise angles count as negative.
It is also possible to put a sign to an angle of rotation in three dimensions, assuming the axis of rotation has been oriented. Specifically, a right-handed turn around an axis usually counts as positive, while a left-handed rotation counts as negative.
In arithmetic and physics, it is common to label certain directions as positive or negative. For a basic example, the number line is usually drawn with positive numbers to the right, and negative numbers to the left:
On the Cartesian plane, the rightward and upward directions are usually thought of as positive, with rightward being the positive "x"-direction, and upward being the positive "y"-direction.
In addition to the sign of a real number, the word sign is also used in various related ways throughout mathematics and the sciences:

Exxon Valdez oil spill

The "Exxon Valdez" oil spill was a shipping accident that happened off the coast of the United States on March 24, 1989. An oil tanker, the "Exxon Valdez", hit a reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska. At the time of the disaster, the ship carried 53,094,510 U.S. gallons (44,210,430 imp gal/200,984,600 L) of crude oil. The accident caused a massive oil spill: 10.8 million U.S. gallons (9.0 million imp gal/41 million L) were spilled into the Prince William Sound. It was one of the worst man-made environmental disasters in the history of the United States. 
The ship had left the shipping lanes because of icebergs. The ship never returned to the shipping lane and hit Bligh Reef at around 12:04 AM. Later, people looked at the causes, and found that the people on board were badly trained and overworked. What made things worse was the fact that the government was not prepared to handle a disaster with such large consequences for the environment. This disaster badly damaged the ecosystems of the area. An estimated 21,300 fish died after being poisoned by the crude oil. The birds that ate the fish got sick.
Some of the methods tried to clean up the oil were: burning, mechanical cleaning, and chemical dispersants.

Pope Urban VI (; c. 1318 – October 15, 1389), born Bartolomeo Prignano, was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 203rd Pope from 1378 to 1389.
Prignano was born in Naples. 
In 1364, Prignano was made the Archbishop of Acerenza by Pope Urban V.
Pope Gregory XI made Prignano Archbishop of Bari in 1377.
He was not a cardinal. There were several Popes who were not Cardinals. One of these was Pope Urban V.
Prignano was elected pope on April 8, 1378; and he chose to be called Pope Urban VI. 
A period called the "Western Schism" began on 20 September 20, 1378 when Robert of Geneva (also known as Clement VII) was chosen pope by 13 French cardinals. Clement VII is now considered to have been an antipope. 
A large part of Germany, Flanders, Italy (with exception of Naples), England and Ireland recognized Urban VI as the pope; but many in Western Europe supported the papacy of Clement VII.

Rocca Petru

Rocca Petru (1887–1966) was a poet and writer from Corsica, who wanted his island free from France. At first, he supported the Corsica becoming a part of Italy, but then promoted the autonomy of Corsica after World War II.
Rocca, called Petru in Corsican, was a gifted writer since young age. He contributed in Corsica to the magazine "A Tramuntana". During World War I, he wrote about the war and was decorated with the French Legion of Honor.
From May 1920, Rocca worked with the literary magazine "A Muvra". During the first half of the 20th century, this was the most important Corsican publication in Italian. In 1922 he created the "Partitu Corsu d'Azione", following the model of the Italian Partito Sardo d'Azione of Sardinia that had autonomism ideals.
After that, in the late 1920s, he created the "Partito autonomista di Corsica" with the support of Domenico Parlotti and Dr. Croce, director of the Archivi di Stato della Corsica.
During the late 1930s Rocca, slowly changed his political opinions from wanting autonomy for Corsica to supporting the union of Corsica with Italy. He supported the ideals of Petru Giovacchini, an irredentist leader who created the main pro-Italian political organization in Corsica: the "Gruppi d’Azione Irredentista Corsa".
In 1938, the French government punished him for his approach to the Italian Risorgimento ideals. They took away his French Legion of Honor medal. "A Muvra" started in 1939 to write articles against the Jews (responsible in Rocca's opinion for the French "occupation" of Corsica) and was quickly closed.
During World War II, Rocca supported Benito Mussolini's ideals about the union of Corsica to the Kingdom of Italy. When Italian troops occupied the island in 1942, Rocca was proposed to be "Governor" of a Corsica united to Italy. After the Italian defeat in September 1943, he was harassed by the French authorities.
As a consequence of this in 1946 he was sentenced to 15 years of jail and sent to French Guiana. When released, he quickly recreated his original "Partito autonomista di Corsica".
In 1953, Rocca created an academy for the defense of the Corsican language. He demanded from France the recognition of the Corsican people and language and the creation of the University of Corte. Rocca was, until his death in 1966, a strong supporter of Corsican nationalism.

Lyme Regis

Lyme Regis is a coastal town in West Dorset, England, 25 miles west of Dorchester and east of Exeter. The town lies in Lyme Bay, on the English Channel coast at the Dorset-Devon border. It is nicknamed 'The Pearl of Dorset'. 
The town is noted for the fossils found in the cliffs and beaches, which are part of the Jurassic Coast–a World Heritage Site. The harbour wall, "The Cobb", features in Jane Austen's novel "Persuasion", and in the movie and novel, "The French Lieutenant's Woman", by local writer John Fowles.
The town's population at the most recent census was 4,406, 45% of whom were retired.
The town is noted for the fossils found in the cliffs and beaches, which are part of the Jurassic Coast–a World Heritage Site. The Jurassic Coast stretches over a distance of . 
The coastal exposures along the coastline provide a continuous sequence of Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous rock formations spanning approximately 185 million years of the Earth's history. The localities along the Jurassic Coast include some important fossil zones.
The Blue Lias rock is host to a multitude of remains from the early Jurassic, a time from which good fossil records are rare. Many of the remains are well preserved, with complete specimens of several important species. Many of the earliest discoveries of dinosaur and other prehistoric reptile remains were made in the area surrounding Lyme Regis, notably those discovered by Mary Anning (1799–1847). Significant finds include "Ichthyosaur", "Plesiosaur", "Dimorphodon", "Scelidosaurus", one of the first armoured (Thyreophora) dinosaurs. The town now holds an annual Mary Anning Day and Lyme Regis Fossil Festival. A fossil of the world's largest moth was discovered in 1966 at Lyme Regis.
The coastal region near Lyme Regis is subject to large landslips. This means that Jurassic age fossils are regularly exposed and can be found on the beaches, but also causes devastation to the town.
One of the most spectacular landslips occurred on 24 December 1839, west along the coast in Devon belonging to Bindon Manor and known as "The Dowlands Landslip". About of fields growing wheat and turnips were dislodged when a great chasm was formed more than across, deep and long. The crops remained intact on the top of what became known as "Goat Island" among the newly formed gullies. On 3 February 1840, five weeks later, there was a second landslip nearby but much smaller than the former. This strange phenomenon attracted many visitors, and the canny farmers charged sixpence for entrance and held a grand reaping party when the wheat ripened. The area is now known as The Undercliff and is of great interest because of its diverse natural history.
In 2005, work began on a £16 million engineering project to stabilise the cliffs and protect the town from coastal erosion. The town's main beach was reconstructed and re-opened on 1 July 2006.
On the evening of 6 May 2008, a section of land slipped onto the beach between Lyme Regis and Charmouth. Local Police described the landslip as the "worst for 100 years".

Non-renewable resource

A non-renewable resource is a natural resource that is used up faster than it can be made by nature. It cannot
be produced, grown or generated on a scale which can sustain how quickly it is being consumed. Once it is used up, there is no more available for future needs. Also considered non-renewable are resources that are consumed much faster than nature can create them. Fossil fuels (such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas), types of nuclear power (uranium) and certain aquifers are examples. Resources such as timber (when harvested sustainably) or metals (which can be recycled) are considered renewable resources.

Kimmeridge clay

The Kimmeridge clay formation is a sedimentary deposit of fossiliferous marine clay and mudstones. It is of Upper Jurassic age, and occurs in Europe. It gives its name to a stage in the Upper Jurassic called the Kimmeridgian, lasting from 157.3–152.1 million years ago.
Kimmeridge clay is perhaps the most economically important unit of rocks in the whole of Europe, because it is the major source for oil fields in the North Sea. 
The clay is named after the village of Kimmeridge on the Dorset coast of England, where it is well exposed and forms part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. It exists across England, in a band stretching from Dorset in the south-west, north-east to East Anglia and Hull. The River Humber Bridge's foundations are in the Kimmeridge Clay deposits under the Humber estuary.
The fossil fauna of the Kimmeridge Clay includes a reptile fauna of turtles, crocodiles, dinosaurs, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs, as well as many invertebrate species such as "Gryphaea".
The Kimmeridge Clay was laid down in 
an environment which is not present on the Earth today. Much of Western Europe was covered by a high sea-level: this may be related to the opening of the Atlantic. As a consequence, the UK was covered by a shallow and largely anoxic sea, perhaps less than 100m deep, with occasional landmasses. 
This was shallower water than the Blue Lias of the Lower Jurassic. It was often low in oxygen, which led to its organic material being only partially decomposed. The mudstones are organic-rich, and gave rise to most of the North Sea oil.

Orbital forcing

Orbital forcing is the effect on climate of slow changes in the tilt of the Earth's axis and shape of the orbit (see Milankovitch cycles). These orbital changes alter the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth by up to 25% at mid-latitudes. In this context, the term "forcing" is a physical process that affects the Earth's climate.
This mechanism is believed to be responsible for the timing of the ice age cycles. The timing of past glacial periods coincides very well with the predictions of the Milankovitch theory, and these effects can be calculated into the future.
Note in the graphic the strong 100,000 year periodicity of the cycles, and the striking asymmetry of the curves. Ice ages deepen by progressive steps, but the recovery to interglacial conditions occurs in one big step.

States of Malaysia

Malaysia is a federation which consists of thirteen states ("Negeri") and three federal territories ("Wilayah Persekutuan"). Eleven states and two federal territories are located on the Malay Peninsula while the remaining two states and one federal territory are on the island of Borneo.
Malaysia is a federation consisting of 13 states ("Negeri") and 3 federal territories ("Wilayah Persekutuan"). These are divided between the two regions of Malaysia, with 11 states and 2 federal territories on Peninsula Malaysia and the other 2 states and 1 federal territory in East Malaysia. 
As Malaysia is a federation, the governance of the states is divided between the federal and the state governments, while the Federal government has direct administration of the federal territories. The specific responsibilities of the federal and the state governments are listed in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution of Malaysia. Theoretically, any matter not set out in the Ninth Schedule can be legislated on by the individual states. However, legal scholars generally view this as a "pauper's bequest" because of the large scope of the matters listed in the Ninth Schedule. The courts themselves have generally favoured a broad interpretation of the language of the Ninth Schedule, thus limiting the number of possible subjects not covered. The Ninth Schedule specifically lists the following matters as those that can only be legislated on by the states: land tenure, the Islamic religion, and local government. 
The 13 states are based on historical Malay Kingdoms, and 9 of the 13 states, known as the Malay States, retain their royal families. The Federal King (titled "Yang di-Pertuan Agong") is elected (de facto rotated) among the nine rulers to serve a 5-year term. The nine "Malay States" have a hereditary Ruler as titular Head of state and an executive Chief Minister or "Menteri Besar" as politically responsible Head of government. The rulers of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Pahang, Perak, Selangor and Terengganu are styled Sultans (typically Islamic). Only Negeri Sembilan's elective ruler holds the rare, autochthonous Malay title of "Yang di-Pertuan Besar", whereas only the Ruler of Perlis is titled "Raja". Former British settlements and crown colonies of Penang and Malacca (both peninsular) and Sabah and Sarawak (both on Borneo) each have a federally appointed titular Governor (styled "Yang di-Pertua Negeri") and an executive Chief Minister or "Ketua Menteri".
Sabah and Sarawak have additional powers as part of the terms when they joined Malaysia, such as immigration controls. They have separate immigration policies and controls and a unique residency status. Passports are required even for Malaysians for travelling between these two states or between either state and Peninsular Malaysia, however Peninsular Malaysians who are on social/business visits up to three months are allowed to produce a MyKad or birth certificate and fill in a special form in lieu of a passport.
Each state has a unicameral legislature called "Dewan Undangan Negeri" ("DUN", State Assembly). Members of DUN are elected from single-member constituencies drawn based on the population. The state leader of the majority party in DUN is usually appointed Chief Minister by the Ruler or Governor. The term of DUN members is five years unless the assembly is dissolved earlier by the Ruler or Governor on the advise of the Chief Minister. Usually, DUN of the states in Peninsular Malaysia are dissolved in conjunction with the dissolution of the federal parliament, in order to have state elections running concurrently with the parliamentary election. However, Rulers and Governors hold discretionary powers in dissolving the DUN.Each state sends two representatives to the "Dewan Negara" (Senate), the upper house of the federal parliament.
The Parliament of Malaysia is permitted to legislate on issues of land, Islamic religion and local government in order to provide for a uniform law between different states, or on the request of the state assembly concerned. The law in question must also be passed by the state assembly as well, except in the case of certain land law-related subjects. Non-Islamic issues that fall under the purview of the state may also be legislated on at the federal level for the purpose of conforming with Malaysian treaty obligations. Each state is further divided into districts, which are then divided into mukim. In Sabah and Sarawak districts are grouped into "Divisions".
 was a Malaysian state from the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 until it was expelled from the Federation on 9 August 1965.

Works of Jagadguru Rambhadracharya

Jagadguru Ramanandacharya Swami Rambhadracharya (better-known as Jagadguru Rambhadracharya or Swami Rambhadracharya) is a Hindu "guru", Sanskrit scholar, writer, poet, play writer, composer, singer, philosopher and "Katha" artist. He is living in Chitrakoot, India. His works includes poems, plays, lectures, commentaries, religious speeches, and musical works of his works. He has written more than 90 works, including published books and unpublished hand written books, and four epic poems, a Hindi commentary on Tulsidas' Ramcharitmanas, a rhythmic Sanskrit commentary on the Ashtadhyayi, and Sanskrit commentaries on the Prasthanatrayi sacred books. Many of his audio and video recordings have been released. He writes in Sanskrit, Hindi, Awadhi, Maithili, and many other languages. He is blind.
"Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam" is his most famous work. He won many awards for it like the Sahitya Akademi Award for Sanskrit. He has also been given many other honors and titles as a writer and poet, like "Mahakavi" and "Kavikularatna".
His important literature works and musical works, grouped by their type, are listed below.
Rambhadracharya made Sanskrit commentaries named "Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam" on the Prasthanatrayi – Brahma Sutra, the Bhagavad Gita, and eleven Upanishads. These commentaries were released on 10 April 1998 by the then Prime Minister of India, Atal Behari Vajpayee. He made "Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam" on Narada Bhakti Sutra in 1991. Rambhadracharya then renewed—after five hundred years—the tradition of Sanskrit commentaries on the Prasthanatrayi. His commentary was also the second Sanskrit commentary on Prasthanatrayi of Ramananda Sampradaya, an the first was made by Ramananda himself and it was named "Ānandabhāṣyam". Rambhadracharya's commentary in Sanskrit on the Prasthanatrayi was the first written in almost 600 years.
Rambhadracharya's most controversial work was the critical edition of the Ramcharitmanas. It was published as the Tulsi Peeth edition. It was said that he changed the epic, but the dispute ended when Rambhadracharya said sorry for any problem caused by the publication. A writ was also filed against him but it was not accepted. This edition was published in 2005 by Shri Tulsi Peeth Seva Nyas.

Fermi paradox

Enrico Fermi's paradox wonders why, given the age and size of the universe and that there are billions of stars and planets that have existed for billions of years, we have not detected any other alien civilizations. There have been attempts to resolve the Fermi paradox by finding evidence of alien civilizations, along with thoughts that such life could exist without humans knowing.
The physicist Enrico Fermi first asked the question in an informal discussion in 1950. A paper by Michael H. Hart in 1975 made scientists more curious and they began to study the question in more detail. This is why some people call it the Fermi–Hart paradox. Other common names for the same phenomenon are "Fermi's question" ("Where are they?"), the "Fermi Problem", the "Great Silence", and "silentium universi" (Latin for "the silence of the universe"; the misspelling "silencium universi" is also common).

Drake equation

In 1961, Frank Drake wrote down an equation for the chance of a contactable alien civilization from another planet in the Milky Way Galaxy. This is known as the Drake Equation (sometimes called the Green Bank equation or the Green Bank Formula). Carl Sagan mentioned the Drake equation often so it that has been mistaken for the 'Sagan equation'. 
The Drake equation states that:
where:
and
We don't know the solution to the equation. 
Although written as an equation, Drake's formulation is not particularly useful for getting a value of formula_2. The last four parameters, formula_3 and formula_4 are not known. They are very hard to guess, with values ranging over many orders of magnitude. Therefore, the SETI League says the importance of the Drake equation is not in solving it, but in thinking about it. It may be more useful to think of it as a series of questions framed as a numbers game.

The Mexican Revolution was brought on by a major armed struggle that started in 1911, among other factors, with an uprising led by Francisco I. Madero against longtime autocrat Porfirio Díaz. The Revolution was characterized by several socialist, liberal, anarchist, populist, and agrarianist movements. Over time the Revolution changed from a revolt against the established order to a multi-sided civil war. 
There was less fighting after 1920, when Álvaro Obregón, the most important revolutionary leader still alive, became President. 
During that span, power was concentrated in the hands of a select few; the people had no power to express their opinions or select their public officials. Wealth was likewise concentrated in the hands of the few, and injustice was everywhere, in the cities and the countryside alike.

A tanning bed is a device that emits ultraviolet radiation to give people a tan (make their skin darker). Like the sun, a tanning bed can also cause a sunburn if the person stays in too long. There are many kinds of tanning beds, but most look like the one in the photo.
Tanning beds became popular in Europe and America because of the work of Friedrich Wolff around 1979. He patented his design and charged others to use his ideas. His company, "Wolff Systems" does not build the tanning beds, they research and design for the tanning lamp. Some of the early adopters of the Wolff technology include ETS, Inc., SCA, Sun Industries, Inc., Montego Bay, Sunal. Later, Friedrich sold Wolff Systems to his brother Jorg Wolff, who was the founder of Cosmedico, Ltd., another pioneer in the tanning industry.
Tanning beds use a special fluorescent lamps (16 to 32 per tanning bed) that creates visible light and ultraviolet light. Like all fluorescent lights, they use a ballast system to limit the electricity going to each lamp, which is most often 100 watts per lamp. The tanning beds use a special acrylic, or clear shield over the lamps. Most clear plastics will block ultraviolet, but this special type of plastic lets most of the ultraviolet light pass through. Most tanning beds also have a cooling fan system, to cool the electronics inside the tanning bed and keep it from getting too hot. All tanning beds have a timer, a device to limit the amount of time the person is exposed to the ultraviolet light. After a few minutes, the timer makes the bed turn off.
Like the sun, tanning beds help your skin to produce vitamin D due to the exposure to the UV (ultraviolet light). Both the sun and tanning beds can damage your skin if you stay exposed for too long. Getting too much UV, or many sunburns can cause skin cancer, including melanoma, which can be deadly. There is a lot of controversy due to the risks. Most countries have many laws and rules that regulate tanning beds.

The area was first called the Navarre Diggings after gold was found in June 1859 by a group led by James Law (1827-1910). It was about six miles from the Navarre township. This caused a gold rush and there were soon about 700 people on the diggings. At the peak of the rush, there were over 6000 people in the area digging for gold.
James Law, who had come to Australia from Scotland, was given a reward of 150 pounds for being the first person to find gold. Other members of his group, John Fewster, W.R. Marshall and George Mill also were rewarded.
The name was changed to Barkly on 1 November 1861, after the Governor of Victoria, Sir Henry Barkly. The name was changed by the local gold warden, Mr. Warden Alley, a government official in charge of the diggings. A school was started, the Barkly Common School.
A cemetery, now called the Pioneer Cemetery, was begun close to the original diggings. The town of Barkly developed about two miles from this area, and a new cemetery was opened.
Barkly has a small Anglican church, a hall, and a few houses. The school has been closed and the buildings removed. There is a rose and lavender farm which is open to the public during the year. A headstone was placed on James Law's grave on 5 May, 1985. In 1996 a memorial stone was placed at the site of the first gold discovery.

The country of Azerbaijan is a republic, with the President of Azerbaijan as the head of state, and the Prime Minister of Azerbaijan as head of government. The Constitution of Azerbaijan makes the President the Commander-in-Chief of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces and the President of Azerbaijan has more powers than the Prime Minister of Azerbaijan and the National Assembly of Azerbaijan. 
The President is directly elected by the people for a five-year term and can be re-elected without any limit. The President cannot be put on trial or put in prison during his term. 
The President can call a national referendum for important issues for the country, such as changing the articles of the Constitution, because a referendum is necessary for changing the Constitution. The Constitution also allows the President to be a member of a political party.
The current President of Azerbaijan is Ilham Aliyev. The list includes all the presidents that lead the country after it became independent in 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed the same year. This is a complete list of the Presidents of Azerbaijan.

Bullet-proof glass

Bullet-proof glass, or bullet-resistant glass, is a type of strong, clear material that resists bullets. Complete protection against all weapons is not possible.
It is usually made from two or more types of material, one hard and one soft. The softer layer makes the glass more elastic, so it can flex (bend) instead of shatter. There must be a clear view through the glass. Bulletproof glass varies in thickness from three-quarters of an inch to three inches.
A popular method is stick a special plastic film to the inner surface of ordinary glass. This 'security laminate' bonds to the glass with an adhesive. This gives a protection similar to the multi-layered bullet-resistant glass. Transparency is better, tint-free; thickness and weight is reduced as much as 50-70%. The laminate can be stuck on to existing windows; this a called a 'retrofit'.
The plastic provides little bullet-resistance. Glass, much harder than plastic, flattens the bullet. The plastic deforms, absorbing energy and (perhaps) stopping the bullet. The ability of the plastic layer to stop projectiles is directly proportional to its thickness. Bulletproof glass may be up to three inches thick.
All the parts of the glass must be transparent. The essential components are these:
The most usual method today requires three parts in layers:
A simpler version is used for car windshields. It consists of two panels of toughened glass, bonded together with polyvinyl butyal (PVB). The PVB stops cracks in the outer glass from spreading.
The idea is for guards inside to be able to shoot out, while attackers can't shoot in. One-way bulletproof glass is usually made of only two layers, a brittle layer on the outside and a flexible one on the inside. A bullet fired from the outside hits the brittle layer first, shattering an area of it. This absorbs some of the bullet's kinetic energy, and spreads it on a larger area. When the slowed bullet hits the flexible layer, it is stopped. 
However, when a bullet is fired from the inside, it hits the flexible layer first. The bullet penetrates the flexible layer because its energy is focused on a smaller area; the brittle layer then shatters outward due to the flexing of the inner layer and does not significantly hinder the bullet's progress. A problem with this idea is that a two-layer glass has limited stopping power.
There is a new type of transparent armour with aluminium oxynitride instead of glass. As the outside 'strike plate' layer, it is much lighter and performs better than traditional glass/polymer laminates. Aluminum oxynitride 'glass' can defeat .50 caliber armour-piercing rounds. Various types of other materials which closely resemble glass are also being developed.
Certain types of ceramic can also be used for "transparent" armour. They are denser and harder than traditional glass. These new types of transparent ceramic armours make thinner armour with equal stopping power to traditional laminated glass.

Frank Drake

Frank Donald Drake PhD is an American astronomer (a scientist who studies the universe and what is inside it) and astrophysicist (someone who studies the physics of astronomy). He is most famous for joining in the first new SETI (Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence) experiment in 1960 and for making the Drake equation.
Born on the 28th of May 1930 in Chicago to Richard and Winifred Drake. As a young boy (in Chicago), Drake loved electronics and chemistry. He says that he thought of life on other planets but never said the idea with his family or teachers.
He enrolled at Cornell University on a Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps scholarship. Once there, he began studying astronomy. A lecture from astrophysist Otto Struve in 1951 strengthen Drake's ideas about the possibility of extraterrestrial life. After college, he served briefly as an electronics officer on the USS Albany. He then went on to graduate school at Harvard in radio astronomy.
Drake's hobbies include lapidary and orchid cultivation.
Drake started his career undertaking radio astronomical research at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Green Bank, West Virginia, and for a short time in 1963 at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He conducted key measurements which revealed the presence of a Jovian ionosphere and magnetosphere.
In 1960, he started Project Ozma, which searches for extraterrestrial life. Drake is one of the pioneers of the modern field of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence with Giuseppe Cocconi, Philip Morrison, Iosif Shklovsky, and Carl Sagan. 
Drake joined the Astronomy faculty of Cornell University in 1963. Drake lead the conversion of the Arecibo Observatory to a radio astronomical facility. He lead Arecibo's improvements in 1974 and 1996. As a researcher, Drake was involved in the early work on pulsars. In this period, Drake was a professor at Cornell University and Director of the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC) – the formal name for the Arecibo facility. In 1974 he wrote the Arecibo message.
Drake co-designed the Pioneer plaque with Carl Sagan in 1972, the first physical message sent into space. The plaque was made to be read by clever alien life if they find it. He later helped the making of the Voyager Golden Record. He was elected to the AAAS in 1974.
Drake is a member of the National Academy of Sciences where he chaired the Board of Physics and Astronomy of the National Research Council (1989–92). He also served as President of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. He was a Professor of Astronomy at Cornell University (1964–84) and served as the Director of the Arecibo Observatory. He is currently involved in "The Carl Sagan Center for the Study of life in the universe".
He is Emeritus Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz where he also served as Dean of Natural Sciences (1984–88). He serves on the Board of Trustees of the SETI Institute.
Drake Planetarium at Norwood High School in Norwood, Ohio is named for Dr. Drake and linked to NASA.

This It has been known as a landmark since the 16th century. Spanish ships crossed the Pacific Ocean by following the Pacific trade winds. The North Equatorial Current brought them to the North American coastline. After landfall, the Manila galleons would sail down the coast to Acapulco in Mexico.
Francis Drake sighted Cape Mendocino in 1576.
Hasekura Tsunenaga's sailed from Japan to Cape Mendocino in 1613. Hasekura was on a diplomatic mission. He was traveling to the courts of Philip II of Spain and Pope Paul V.
The Cape Mendocino region is an active earthquake zone. In April 1992, three big earthquakes were centered near the cape.
The Mendocino Triple Junction is to the west of Cape Mendocino under the Pacific Ocean. It is a geologic triple junction where three tectonic plates come together. The San Andreas Fault, a transform boundary, runs south from the junction, separating the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. To the north is the Cascadia subduction zone, where the Gorda Plate is being subducted under the edge of the North American plate. Running west from the triple junction is the Mendocino Fracture Zone, the transform boundary between the Gorda Plate and the Pacific Plate.

Indo-Pakistani War of 1971

The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 was a military conflict between India and Pakistan. Lasting just 13 days, it is considered one of the shortest wars in history.
During the war, Indian and Pakistani forces fought on the eastern and western fronts. The war effectively came to an end after the Eastern Command of the Pakistani Armed Forces signed the Instrument of Surrender (1971) on December 16, 1971. After the surrender, East Pakistan seceded as the independent state of Bangladesh. Around 97,368 West Pakistanis who were in East Pakistan at the time of its independence, including some 79,700 Pakistan Army soldiers and paramilitary personnel and 12,500 civilians, were taken as prisoners of war by India.
The Soviet Union sided with the Bangladeshis, and supported the Indian Army and Mukti Bahini during the war. The Soviets thought that the independence of Bangladesh would weaken the position of its rivals—the United States and China. The USSR gave assurances to India that if a confrontation with the United States or China developed, it would take counter-measures. This assurance was enshrined in the Indo-Soviet friendship treaty signed in August 1971.
The United States supported Pakistan politically and with supplies. President Richard Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger feared Soviet expansion into South and Southeast Asia. Pakistan was a close ally of the People's Republic of China, with whom Nixon had been negotiating a "rapprochement". Nixon was planning to visit China in February 1972. Nixon feared that an Indian invasion of West Pakistan would give the Soviets control over the region. It would seriously undermine the global position of the United States and the regional position of America's new tacit ally, China. In order to demonstrate to China the "bona fides" of the United States as an ally, Nixon sent military supplies to Pakistan, routing them through Jordan and Iran, while also encouraging China to increase its arms supplies to Pakistan. The Nixon administration also ignored reports it received of the "genocidal" activities of the Pakistani Army in East Pakistan, most notably the Blood telegram. This prompted widespread criticism and condemnation both by Congress and in the international press.
The United States introduced a resolution in the UN Security Council calling for a cease-fire and the withdrawal of armed forces by India and Pakistan. It was vetoed by the Soviet Union. In the following days Nixon and Kissinger tried to get India to withdraw, but they did not succeed.
President Nixon requested Iran and Jordan to send their F-86, F-104 and F-5 fighter jets in aid of Pakistan. 
When Pakistan's defeat in the eastern sector seemed certain, Nixon deployed a carrier battle group led by the aircraft carrier USS "Enterprise" into the Bay of Bengal. The "Enterprise" and its escort ships arrived on station on 11 December 1971. According to a Russian documentary, the United Kingdom deployed a carrier battle group led by the aircraft carrier HMS "Eagle" to the Bay.
On 6 December and 13 December, the Soviet Navy dispatched two groups of cruisers and destroyers and a submarine armed with nuclear missiles from Vladivostok; they trailed U.S. Task Force 74 into the Indian Ocean from 18 December 1971 until 7 January 1972. The Soviets also had a nuclear submarine to help ward off the threat posed by USS "Enterprise" task force in the Indian Ocean.

Many people think that AVR stands for Alf (Egil Bogen) and Vegard (Wollan)'s Risc processor".
This architecture replaces older MCS-51 architecture. One machine cycle of MCS-51 takes 12 clock cycles and most of instructions are executed in one machine cycle.
AVR microcontrollers (MCUs) can execute most of instructions in single machine cycle too, but one machine cycle takes only one clock cycle. Performance per clock cycle is 12 times higher with AVR.
The core has 32 general purpose registers directly connected to ALU. It allowing two independent
registers to be accessed and instruction with them executed in one machine cycle.

Ludwig Wittgenstein's, 1921 book "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus" formed the basis for the group's ideas. Wittgenstein himself insisted that they did not understand him correctly and took to quietly reading poetry to himself during their meetings. 
The Vienna Circle was broken up when the Nazi party came to power in Germany in 1933, many of its members moved to the USA, where they became teachers in several universities. 
The Vienna Circle's influence on 20th century philosophy was very large.

Senedd

The Senedd (), also called the National Assembly building, contains the "debating chamber" and 3 committee rooms for the National Assembly for Wales in Cardiff. The building is 5,308 square meters (57,100 sq ft) large. 
After 2 selection processes were held, it was decided a new debating chamber for Wales was to built on a new site," Site 1E," at Capital Waterside in Cardiff Bay. 
Richard Rogers, an architect who had won the Pritzker Prize, won the international competition to design the building. It was designed to be sustainable, with renewable technologies, and to be energy efficient. The building was awarded an "Excellent" certification by the" Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method", the highest ever certification to be awarded in Wales, and was nominated for the 2006 Stirling Prize. The Senedd is now a symbol of Cardiff, and Wales.
The Senedd was constructed in two phases, the first in 2001 and the second starting in August 2003, until it was handed over to the National Assembly in February 2006.
Between the phases, the National Assembly changed contractors and the management structure of the project, but kept Rogers as architect.
Once finished, the building cost almost 6 times more than expected, and was finished 4 years and 10 months late (compared to estimates in 1997).
The cost grew because of the extra security that had to be added after the September 11 attacks, and because the National Assembly did not have an independent estimate of the project's cost until December 2000, three years after the original estimate. The costs of the second phase grew by less than 6% over budget, and was 6 months late, because of ICT problems.
It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 1 March 2006 and it cost £69.6 million, which included £49.7 million in construction costs. The Senedd is part of the land owned by the National Assembly that includes Tŷ Hywel and the Pierhead Building.

Harley-Davidson, or H-D for short, is an American motorcycle maker that started making motorcycles in Milwaukee in 1903. The company makes heavyweight motorcycles that are designed for cruising on the highway; they're called Harleys. Harley-Davidson is one of two big U.S. companies that made motorcycles that was still in business after the Great Depression; the other closed down in 1953.
Harleys have a special look and sound. Most new Harleys, except the V-Rods, are made to look like old Harleys. Harley-Davidson made small motorcycles in the US and in Italy, but they didn't sell well enough. They stopped making small motorcycles in the US in 1966 and in Italy in 1978.
Harley-Davidson and their motorcycles have many fans. The fans can join clubs and go to events or to Harley-Davidson's museum. Apart from selling motorcycles, Harley-Davidson also charges fees for companies to put Harley-Davidson's logos on the things they make. Less than one-hundredth of the money Harley-Davidson made in 2010 came from these fees.
William S. Harley, Arthur Davidson, William A. Davidson and Walter Davidson, Sr. were inducted into the Labor Hall of Honor. They were given the award for their good work for the H-D company and its workforce.

Ultralight material

Ultralight materials are very light substances. They include silica aerogels, carbon nanotube aerogels, metallic foams, polymeric foams, and metallic microlattices. The density of air is about 1.275 mg/cm, which means that the air in the pores greatly lowers the density of the material.
The lightest material ever made was invented in 2011. It is made out of a microscopic micro-lattice of hollow tubes – a criss-cross diagonal pattern with open spaces between the tubes. The researchers say the material is 100 times lighter than Styrofoam and is very strong. The material is low density: it has a density of 0.9 milligrams per cubic centimetre. Silica aerogels, the world's lightest "solid" materials, are only as low as 1.0 mg per cubic cm. The metallic micro-lattices are 99.99% air and only 0.01% solid. The metal used is nickel.
The material is not just light: it has some elastic properties. When it is squashed, the little tubes are also squashed, but when the pressure is removed, they rebound. A sample squashed to half its height rebounds 98% when the pressure is lifted. That makes the material similar in some ways to elastomers: they are materials used to cushion against shock.

The word VENONA is in capital letters (VENONA) although in many writings it seen as lowercase letters (Venona). VENONA was made to spy on Soviet government communications. The Venona project was most famous for the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg case known as LIBERAL and it ended in both of them being executed. 
In July 1995, the first six public releases were shown which also had 49 messages about the Soviets trying to get information on the United States atomic bomb and the Manhattan Project. In the next five more years, about 3,000 VENONA messages were made public.

The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) is a NASA mission to land and control a rover named Curiosity on the surface of the planet Mars. The MSL was launched on November 26, 2011. The MSL successfully did the first-ever precision landing on Mars. It landed on Mars at Gale Crater on August 5, 2012 and began exploring the surface.
The goal of the Curiosity rover is to study the history of Mars. It was to see whether Mars has, or ever had, an environment able to support microbial life. It indeed did that, finding evidence that 3 Billion years ago there was once water and a life-supporting environment. It is important to know that it found that life COULD HAVE existed, not that it certainly DID. It will also carefully look at samples scooped up from the soil and drilled powders from rocks.
"Curiosity" is five times as heavy as the Mars Exploration Rovers "Spirit" or "Opportunity" and carries more than ten times their mass of scientific instruments . It was launched by an Atlas V 541 rocket. "Curiosity" will be expected to work for at least 1 Martian year (668 Martian sols/686 Earth days), but may live a lot longer than that. It will explore Mars with greater range than any other rover.
Mars Science Laboratory mission is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program. The program is a long-term mission of robotic exploration of Mars. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology manages the program for NASA. The total cost of the MSL project is about US$2.3 billion.

Mayfair (first called The May Fair) is an area in central London. It is in the city of Westminster.
Mayfair is named after the annual fortnight-long "May Fair" that happened in a place that is Shepherd Market today (from 1686 until it was banned at that place in 1764). Until 1686, the May Fair was held in Haymarket, and after 1764, it moved to Fair Field in Bow.
Mayfair was bordered by Hyde Park to the west, Oxford Street to the north, Piccadilly to the south and Bond Street to the east, although the eastern boundary has been made longer recently, so now it goes all the way to Regent Street. Most of the area was first made between the mid 17th century and the mid 18th century.
The district is mostly commercial now. It has many offices in houses and new buildings. The price of rents in Mayfair are some of the highest in London and the world. There is still a large amount of houses as well as some exclusive shopping and London's largest amount of luxury hotels and many restaurants. Some buildings in Mayfair are:
The City of Westminster uses the Mayfair Library as a local library.
St. Nicholas College of London has lessons in English and other languages for people who live in and visit Mayfair.

Folie à deux

Folie à deux is the name for a condition where an otherwise sane person develops the symptoms and delusions of a person suffering from psychosis. If more than two people share the symptoms or delusions, people speak about "folie à trois" (3), "folie à quatre" (4), "folie à plusieurs", or "folie en famille". Officially, the condition is known as induced delusional disorder or shared psychotic disorder today, but many publications still use the original terms, which were developed in France in the 19th century.
Today, there are two main forms of the condition:
Newer studies seem to indicate that this classification may not be sufficient to fully describe 'folie à deux'. There may be more symptoms than are usually described in the cases above. Also, in many cases, separating the two patients may not be enough to make the condition go away in one of them. Also, the person described as "sane" before developing the folie à deux may already be suffering from a psychiatric illness, or may develop one. 
The condition was first described in an article pubilshed by Ernest-Charles Lasègue and Jules Farlet in 1877.
Mass hysteria can be seen as a form of folie à deux.

<doc id="315385" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=315385" title="SnRNP">
SnRNP

Small nuclear RNA (snRNP, or 'snurps'), joins with proteins to form spliceosomes. The spiceosomes govern alternative splicing.
The background to this is that, in eukaryotes, most genes code for a protein in separated strings of DNA. This is because, of a total gene, coding bits (exons) are separated by non-coding bits (introns). The process called alternative splicing can produce many possible proteins from the gene parts because the proteins are put together in different ways. Alternative splicing produces alternative messenger RNAs, and these produce different proteins. Spliceosomes control the details of the splicing.
The two essential components of snRNPs are protein molecules and RNA. The RNA found within each snRNP particle is known as small nuclear RNA, or snRNA, and is usually about 150 nucleotides in length. The snRNA component of the snurp is specific to individual introns because it 'recognises' the sequences of critical signals at the ends and branch sites of introns. The snRNA in snurps is similar to ribosomal RNA: it acts both as an enzyme (catalyst) and builds structure.
SnRNPs were discovered by Michael Lerner and Joan Steitz.
Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman also played a role in the discovery, winning the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1989 for their independent discoveries that RNA can act as a catalyst in cell development.

Dave Seville (Jason Lee), the chipmunks, and the chipettes are on a cruise with Dave for a family vacation. Dave discovers that his old boss, Ian Hawke (David Cross) is working as a pelican on the Cruise. Dave warns Alvin to not have too much fun but Alvin does not listen and him and the other chipmunks get blown away while holding onto a kite and they end up stranded on a deserted island. Dave tries to take a hanglider to find the chipmunks but after Ian tries to stop him and they both end up in the ocean.
On the island, the chipmunks try to find food and they meet a castaway, Zoe (Jenny Slate). She shows the chipmunks her hut she built with a zip line. Eleanor sprains her ankle after falling from the zip line and Simon gets bitten by a spider. This gives him a neurotoxin disease making him believe he is a French explorer named "Simone." Simone asks Jeanette to dance, thinking she is beautiful, much to Alvin's dismay. Zoe takes Simone, Jeanette, Eleanor and Theodore to a waterfall and Simone finds a cave full of gold and jewellery.
The next day, Alvin and Brittnay notice the volcano on the island is active and decide they had better leave the island after Dave and Ian arrive at the island. They begin to build a raft to escape the island. Simone and Jeanette are still looking for food. Zoe knocks Simone out with a golf ball, and captures Jeanette. She forces her to give her all the gold, by tying Jeanette to a rope and putting her down into the cave. Even though Jeanette refuses, Zoe still makes her.
Later, Simon wakes up as his normal self and cannot remember anything after the spider bite. When the others cross a tree log to find Jeanette but when the ground begins to rumble, Zoe lets go of the rope. Jeanette follows Dave and Alvin back but gets caught by Zoe who still forces Jeanette to give her the gold. Simon saves Jeanette from Zoe. Alvin cuts the rope, releasing Zoe's grip and as the log begins to crack, Dave hangs on and Ian finally convinces Zoe to help save Dave.
They escape the island on the raft just as the volcano erupts and later are rescued by a rescue helicopter, Jeanette gives Zoe a bracelet that Simone gave her as a present. Alvin and Dave reconcile.
The chipmunks and chipettes perform at the International Music Awards and Ian gets his job back by selling Zoe's story to Hollywood.
In the epilogue on the flight home, Alvin speaks on the pilot's microphone that the plane is heading for Timbuktu. The flight attendant says the flight will leave now and Alvin accidentally pushes the food cart and it hits Dave and Dave yells "ALLLLVINNN!!"

<doc id="315459" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=315459" title="Halkett boat">
Halkett boat

A Halkett boat is a type of lightweight inflatable boat. The boat was first created by (1820–1885) during the 1840s. Halkett had been interested in the problems of travelling in the Canadian Arctic. He wanted to make a boat that was light enough to be carried over bad terrain, but strong enough to be used in very bad weather conditions.
Halkett's first design was a boat that was made using cloth combined with rubber. This boat could be filled with air (inflated) to float on water or the air could be removed (deflated) so it would be smaller and lighter to carry. When deflated, the hull of the boat could be worn as a cloak. The oar used as a walking stick and the sail could be used as an umbrella. Next, he created a two-man boat that was small enough to fit into a knapsack. When it was deflated, It could be used as a waterproof blanket.
Many people who explored Canada liked his ideas but they were not very useful to most other people. He tried to show the Royal Navy that the boats could be useful to them but did not succeed. He also could not sell them fishermen and people that hunted duck. They were commercially unsuccessful. Only two Halkett boats are still known to exist. One belonged to Orcadian explorer John Rae. The other is in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum.
Peter Halkett was a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy in the 1840s. He was the son of John Halkett, a director of the Hudson's Bay Company who had lived in Canada for many years before returning to England. Peter Halkett was interested in the exploration of the Canadian Arctic for a long time. He was very interested in John Franklin's Coppermine Expedition of 1819–1822. This expedition had many problems.
Franklin explored the northern coast of Canada for three years. He was looking for the Northwest Passage. His search ended very badly. It was said that people killed other members of the expedition and that some even ate the other people. 11 of the 20 members of the group were killed. The people that were not killed had to eat lichen, their own boots, and the remains of dead animals left by wolves. They had become stranded on the wrong side of the Coppermine River after their boats had been destroyed in a storm. John Richardson tried to swim to safety. This caused him very bad hypothermia. One person in the party built a small canoe from canvas and willow. They had to cross the river one at a time using the canoe.
Halkett was an amateur inventor. During his spare time while in the navy, he worked on building a boat that would be small and light enough to be carried through wilderness, but strong enough to carry people in safety across wide bodies of water. He chose to build a boat in which all parts could also be used as clothing or items that the user would normally carry with them.
Halkett made a waterproof cloak. It was created from an early form of Macintosh cloth. This cloth was made of cotton combined with India rubber. The inside of the cloak was an airtight and watertight inflatable ovoid. It was made of four different airtight sections. If one section was damaged and could not hold air, the others would still keep the boat floating. The cloak had a pocket that held a paddle blade and a small bellows. The person wearing the cloak would carry a walking stick. This stick was also used as the handle for the paddle. There was also a large umbrella which was used as a sail for the boat. The cloak weighed about . It took three to four minutes to inflate the boat. Once the boat was inflated, it could carry six to eight people.
In early 1844, Halkett tested the first boat-cloak on the River Thames. He paddled it without taking on any water. His test went very well. Because of this, he took the boat-cloak with him while on naval service. He used it whenever he could to test it under many different sea conditions. In November 1844, Halkett wanted to test the boat-cloak in bad weather conditions. The seas of the Bay of Biscay were usually very bad, but the weather was unusually calm when he got there. The boat-cloak was very well liked by explorers. John Richardson (who had almost died during the 1819–1822 Coppermine expedition) wrote that "Had we been possessed of such a contrivance in our first expedition, I have little doubt of our having brought the whole party in safely".
Because of how well the boat-cloak did during his tests, Halkett built a larger version. This boat could be folted into a knapsack. When inflated, it could carry two men. Each man would use a paddle on each side of the boat. When deflated, the boat could be used as a waterproof blanket. This would allow the users to sleep on wet ground. The people in charge of the Royal Navy though the boat could be useful to some people but was not likely to be useful to the Navy. On 8 May 1845 Lord Herbert, First Secretary to the Admiralty wrote to Halkett that "My Lords are of an opinion that your invention is extremely clever and ingenious, and that it might be useful in Exploring and Surveying Expeditions, but they do not consider that it would be made applicable for general purposes in the Naval Service".
Although the Navy saw no use for Halkett's boats in general naval service, this larger boat was liked very much by explorers. John Franklin bought one to take on the 1845 expedition. This expedition ended badly. All 129 men and their two ships wee lost and never found. Franklin believed that Halkett boats were very needed to travel in Canada. He gave the boat that was to be used for his expedition to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land so that Simpson could use in his travels in the region. He got another boat from Halkett to be used on his last expedition.
Orkneyman John Rae, known by the Inuit as (, "He who takes long strides"), was a Hudson's Bay Company surgeon. He became a surveyor of the Canadian Arctic. Unlike most Europeans of that time, Rae believed that the local people knew the best ways to deal with the very bad weather conditions. He travelled Inuit-style, using sledges and snowshoes. He slept in snow igloos. Rae took a Halkett boat on his first expedition in 1846. He said that it was "most useful in crossing and recrossing the river at Repulse Bay". He also said that "although in constant use for upwards of six weeks on a rocky coast it never required the slightest repair" and "ought to form part of the equipment of every expedition".
In 1848, the Royal navy sent out people to find out what had become of the ships and men of Franklin's expedition. The search party was led by John Richardson and John Rae. They had a Halkett boat bought by the government. The party did not find Franklin, but they learned that the Halkett boat very useful. During the search, they used the single boat to move their entire party across a river in 14 trips. Rae said that although the rubber of the boat became stiff from the cold, it was not hard to warm it to soften the material when needed. Halkett boats were also taken on 6 other expedition that were sent to look for Franklin. During these they were used for fishing.
In 1851 French explorer Joseph René Bellot led another expedition to find Franklin. This was paid for by Franklin's wife. Bellot took a Halkett boat-cloak on the journey. He said that it was "of immense value in a country where the want of wood renders it impossible to form any sort of raft". Bellot's expedition did not find Franklin. It was not until 1853 that an expedition led by Rae (using with "two beautiful Halkett boats") found a group of Inuit who told them that they saw men dragging a boat four years earlier. Their bodies were found soon after that.
Even though the boats were said to be very good for lake-fishing and duck-shooting and were shown in the Great Exhibition of 1851, they did not sell well. Halkett's boat were not widely used except in the field of Canadian exploration. Halkett died on 23 March 1885, aged 65, and the building of his boats stopped. John Rae gave his boat from the 1853 expedition to a Miss Peace of Kirkwall. Many years later it was found and is now in the Stromness Museum at Orkney. A second boat is in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum.

Mackenzie Large Igneous Province

The Mackenzie Large Igneous Province (MLIP) is a major Mesoproterozoic large igneous province of southwestern, western and northwestern Canada. It is a group of igneous rocks which were formed during a massive igneous event starting about 1,270 million years ago. The large igneous province extends from the Arctic in Nunavut to near the Great Lakes in northwestern Ontario.
MLIP is one of the largest Proterozoic magmatic provinces on Earth, as well as the world's largest and best-preserved continental flood basalt terrain. This huge area of igneous rock was spewed out in a short time, geologically speaking. The MILP is much larger than other well-preserved large igneous provinces. The standard size classification for large igneous provinces is a minimum of . However, the Mackenzie dyke swarm itself occupies an area of at least , making the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province larger than the Ontong Java Plateau in the southwestern Pacific Ocean or the U.S. state of Alaska.
The Mackenzie Large Igneous Province was caused by processes other than normal plate tectonics and seafloor spreading. Igneous rocks of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province are generally mafic in composition, including basalt and gabbro.
Like most large igneous provinces, the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province was caused by a mantle plume—an upwelling zone of abnormally hot rock within the Earth's mantle. As the head of the Mackenzie plume reached the Earth's lithosphere, it spread out and melted catastrophically to form large volumes of basaltic magma. This resulted in the creation of a stationary volcanic zone west of Victoria Island, called the Mackenzie hotspot.
The Coppermine River Group is a sequence of Mesoproterozoic continental flood basalts forming part of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, Canada. It is one of the largest flood basalt provinces on Earth, covering the area with a volume of approximately .
Between 1,200 and 740 million years ago, a series of flood basalt eruptions took place. At the northern portion of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province, vast volumes of basaltic lava paved over a large part of the northwestern Canadian Shield. This constructed a large lava plateau with an area of , a volume of lavas of at least 500,000 km (120,000 cubic miles). 
This extensive area of flood basalt lava flows has been called the Coppermine River flood basalts. With an area of and a volume of 650,000 km (120,000 cubic miles), the Coppermine River flood basalt sequence is larger than the Columbia River Basalt Group in the United States. It compares in size to the Deccan Traps in west-central India. This makes the Coppermine River flood basalts one of the largest flood basalt events ever to appear on the North American continent, as well as on Earth. The maximum thickness of the Coppermine River flood basalts is and has 150 lava flows, each to thick.
The Coppermine River flood basalts occurred shortly after a period of crustal uplift. The uplift then collapsed. This sudden uplift was likely caused by rising magma of the Mackenzie plume, which caused the Mackenzie hotspot. The Coppermine River basalts show over 100 individual lava flows.

Giorgio Orsini

Giorgio Orsini (referred often as Giorgio da Sebenico, Giorgio di Matteo, born 1410, died 1475) was an Italian medieval sculptor and architect from Dalmatia. Orsini lived and worked mainly in the city of Sebenico (modern-day Šibenik, Croatia), Republic of Venice.
Giorgio Orsini descends from ancient and noble House of Orsini. Hard times had been fallen upon the House branch Giorgio belonged to. Mateo, Giorgio's father, as much as Giorgio himself, has forced to support himself and his family by manual labor. As the architect and sculptor, he was educated in the art workshop of sculptors Giovanni and Bartolomeo Buon in Venice. While in Venice, Giorgio married Elizabetta da Monte, who brought him a fair dowry, money and homes in Venice. He invested Elizabetta's money in a grocery store and in a merchant ship which brought them good returns. Elizabetta's husband entrusted her of a power of attorney by which she was able to attend to his affairs while he was absent. In July 1455 Giorgio bought home from a local nobleman Simeonich, where he engraved his family's heraldic symbol - a bear. When signing contracts, Giorgio often used his art name Georgius Dalmaticus, Sixty five years after his death, his grandson, Giacomo, an advocate by vocation, was recognized as a descendant of the noble House of Orsini. Giorgio's and Elizabetta's daughter Flavia married another Dalmatian painter, Giorgio Culinovich (Schiavone) in the year of 1463. Other source claims that the Orsinis' daughter's name was Elena (who married Schiavone).
In Venice, in 1441, Giorgio was invited to Sebenico to replace Messer Antonio di Pietro Paolo who had fallen into disrepute with the building committee of the cathedral of Sebenico. Antonio commenced the Cathedral building in 1431. Giorgio abandoned the Gothic style based ideas of his predecessor and followed revolutionary ideas of Italian Renaissance architecture, The whole cathedral building is roofed with wagon vaults, made of huge slabs of marble supported on strong transverse ribs, the same stone covering forming the ceiling inside and the roof outside. He was the chief cathedral architect from 1441 to 1473. From July 1, 1477 the work was continued by another architect, Niccolò di Giovanni da Firenze. In 1444 Giorgio went to Spalato to build the chapel of S. Ranier in the church of S. Benedetto. The work was finished in two years. He came back to Spalato in 1448 to make the chapel of S. Anastasius in the cathedral.
Orsini did not follow always the Renaissance. There are also several fine late Ancona Gothic buildings, among them the facade of S. Francesco and S. Agostino churches, the build of Palazzo Benincasa, all done by Giorgio Orsini. Work on S. Agostino facade was finished in 1455. On the S. Agostino facade, Orsini worked between 1455 and 1459. On the Loggia dei Mercanti, which was built by Giovanni Pace in 1443, the facade, with statues representing the virtues, is the work of Giorgio Orsini (1451-9) In 1460, Giorgio returned to Sebenico. In 1464 and 1465 he was at Ragusa, where he helped in building the Torre Menze, and in restoring the palace of the Rectors. The Palace of Rectors was badly damaged by the 1462 earthquake. Orsini replaced the tree central capitals, who were damaged beyond repair, of that building. The next year he was at Pago (today Pag, Croatia), improving and enlarging the courtyard of the bishop's palace. The design and work on facade of the cathedral at Ossero belongs to him, too. In the next year he undertook work on the facade of the Cappella Grande of the parish church at Pago. In 1470 he went to Rome, where his compatriot Giovanni Dalmato, the sculptor, of Trau (today Trogir, Croatia), was at work on the monument of Paul II. In 1472 he commenced the facade of S. Maria, Cittanova, in the Marche.
He had many pupils, some of whom continued to work on the cathedral at Sebenico after his death in 1475.
In Croatia, Giorgio Orsini is celebrated as a Croatian sculptor and architect, known under the Croatian name "Juraj Dalmatinac". This name is translation of his art name "Georgius Dalmaticus". The translation is coming from the second half of 19th century. Another version of the Orsini's croatised name is "Juraj Matejević". This name comes as translation of the "Georgvs Mathei" (Georg, Mathew's son) text engraved in the marble of St. Jacob cathedral church in Sebenico. Croatian author Fisković claims that "Orsini", as his family name, was never used by the artist and it was adopted by his son, after the death of his father. His claim is not supported by any documents or records dated back to the times Orsini lived and worked. Fisković's claim is defeated by the home sale contract where Giorgio Orsini was named as the home buyer. Two Italian authors recorded the use of Giorgio's family name by his son Mateo and grandson Giovanni and refuted Fiskovic
Croats erected a monument celebrating Orsini in the front of St. Jacob cathedral church in Šibenik, Croatia. This monument, an over-sized standing statue of Orsini, is a work of Yugoslav sculptor Ivan Meštrović. Two elementary schools in Croatia bear that name: one in Pag, and one in Šibenik.

Gabbro

Gabbro is a large group of dark, coarse-grained, igneous rocks. They are chemically equivalent to basalt. The rocks are plutonic, formed when molten magma is trapped under the Earth's surface and cools into a crystalline mass. 
Most of the Earth's surface has gabbro in the oceanic crust, produced by basalt magmatism at mid-ocean ridges. In general, when the gabbro is formed, it lies above the Earth's mantle, and below the basalt.
Gabbro is generally coarse grained, with crystals in the size range of 1 mm or greater. It is an essential part of the oceanic crust. Long belts of gabbro intrusions are typically formed at proto-rift zones and around ancient rift zone margins.

Facies

Facies is a term in geology. It means the look of a rock. If one looks up at a cliff of rock, the appearances changes from one layer to another. This because the ecological conditions changed as the rock was laid down. So, the facies reflect the process of sedimentation. 
Regular changes in the facies usually means regular changes in the ancient climate. As the climate chaged, so the sea level rose and fell. What was deep water became shallow water, and so on. In the Milankovich cycle, the climate changes regularly. As it does so, deeper water carbonates may alternate with shallow-water shales and silts. These "facies" are seen in the column of rocks.

Towers and other structures protect this building. Players must destroy these first because until then, the main building is unable to be destroyed. The team who destroys the opposing team's building automatically wins. The player controls a hero with whom they advance to the opponent's base. Your hero becomes more powerful with time, you must gather experience and gold because then you are abbe to buy powerful items. The forces of both sides are the same, except for differences in the ability of players. You can choose from over hundred different characters with different abilities. Heroes are divided to a several classes

Floorball

Floorball is an indoor team sport similar to hockey. Floorball is usually played in gyms with little plastic balls and special hockey sticks. In floorball, there are basically five players with sticks and a goalkeeper without any special equipment. The goalkeeper has only special jersey and helmet. Floorball is very popular today and in 2020 it is going to be part of the Summer Olympic Games.
Floorball was invited in the USA, but has been most popular in Sweden since the 1970s. Its popularity quickly spread to Finland and Switzerland, but with different rules. For example, in Switzerland a goalkeeper is allowed to use a stick. In 1986, the International Floorball Federation (IFF) was founded and rules became the same.
Floorball is played in a gym on an area of 40x20 meters bordered by boards 50 centimetres high. The formations are very similar to ice hockey. Both teams play with 3 attackers, 2 defenders and a goalkeeper. They can relieve whenever they want. Floorball is played 3x20 minutes with 15 minutes breaks. This is only for men. In juniors matches the time is different. Floorball is a contact sport so players can play with their body, but it has limits. The only thing they can give a goalkeeper is a stick, but they can handle the ball with the body. They cannot hit the ball with their hands or head and they cannot jump. The goalkeeper can hit the ball with every part of his body and he can it for 3 seconds. In floorball, a player can be excluded for 2 minutes when he breaks the rules.
The most redistricted players have in Sweden. The second is Finland and the third is Czech Republic.
IFF organises world championships in floorball. Every year they are in a different country.

Gaslighting

Gaslighting is a type of psychological abuse where somebody uses lies or tricks to make another person doubt their memory and mental health. Gaslighting can be anything from an abusive person insisting that the abuse never happened, to setting up strange incidents to confuse the victim.
The word "gaslighting" comes from the play by Patrick Hamilton, "Gas Light" (1938), and its movie adaptations. In those works a character uses many tricks, including turning the gas lamps lower than normal, to convince his spouse that she is crazy. Since then, the phrase has become a common expression which has also been used in clinical and research literature.

Images drawn on the tablet are not shown on surface itself but they appear on the monitor. However there are screen hybrids which allow user to see drawing right on the drawing surface. These hybrids are combination of an ordinary tablet and touchscreen (unlike touchscreen, they offer pressure sensitivity and higher resolution).
Stylus: A stylus is a pen-like device (often powered by battery) that allows sending user action to the tablet. It detects different degrees of pressure, e.g. for use in a drawing program to differentiate line thickness or color density. 
Puck: After stylus, pucks are the most commonly used tablet accessory. A puck is a mouse-like device that can detect its absolute position and rotation. Professional pucks often have a loupe for greater precision.
Passive tablets use electromagnetic induction technology. The tablet generates an electromagnetic signal, which is received by the circuit in the stylus. The wires in the tablet then change to a receiving mode and read the signal generated by the stylus.
Active tablets use self-powered electronics that generate and send a signal to the tablet. Tablets may listen for pen signals constantly, so it eliminates inaccuracy of transmission.
Optical tablets operate by a very small digital camera in the stylus.
Acoustic tablets were early models. A small sound generator was mounted in the stylus, and the acoustic signal picked up by two microphones placed near the writing surface.
Electromagnetic tablets work by generating and detecting an electromagnetic signal.
Since a stylus can sense pressure, tilting and other attributes, it is good for computer graphic usage (especially two dimensional). These attributes can make differences between brush size, opacity, shape, color, etc. in certain graphic programs. Graphics tablets are much used for technical drawing and computer-aided design.
They are also used for online teaching, e.g. live tutorials or lessons where visual information is needed. Some users prefer tablet computers for some purposes, though those devices mostly lack sensors for pressure and tilt.

Patrick Murphy (giant)

Patrick Murphy (1834–1862) was an Irish giant, born in County Down from parents James Murphy and mother Peggy (née Cunningham), who put himself in a show as a way of making money. He originally worked on the docks in Liverpool, England and, after that, became a waiter at a hotel. Because he was so tall, Murphy attracted crowds everywhere he went. He eventually decided that he could make a living being tall. He had always told of himself as being 8'10" and in some circles as much as 9'3". In about 1860, he was measured by Dr. Virchow as being 7'3.4" (222 cm) tall.
In May 1857 the Emperor and Empress of Austria invited the tall Irishman to visit their kingdom. While he was on tour throughout Europe, he died of smallpox in Marseille at the age of twenty-eight.

Patrick Murphy (pilot)

Patrick Murphy was an Irish pilot who mistakenly bombed the border town of Naco, Arizona. Not much is known of his personal life. 
Murphy owned a plane around the time of the Cristero War in Mexico against the anti-Catholic government of Emilio Portes Gil. Murphy decided to help the rebels by using his plane to bomb the government-controlled town of Naco, Sonora. He tried many times between March 31 and April 6 to bomb Naco but also accidentally, bombed the Arizona border town with the same name. He destroyed some buildings and a car. United States soldiers eventually came to his house and took away his plane. Murphy escaped to rebel territory in Mexico but returned to the United States and was jailed for a little while.
Murphy became the first person working for another country to ever bomb the mainland United States. Singer Dolan Ellis honored Murphy in one of his songs on his "Tall Tales, Lost Trails & Heroes" album.

Crosstalk, also known by its Chinese name xiangsheng (Simplified Chinese: 相声, Traditional Chinese: 相聲, pinyin: "xiàngsheng", literally, "looking at each other and speaking"), is a traditional Chinese comedy form. Crosstalk is a special kind of dialogue and a special kind of performance.
The comic language has many puns and allusions. The words are spoken in a fast, rushed manner. The comedy is a kind of banter. 
According to Canadian crosstalk comedian Dashan (Mark Rowswell), the closest equivalent in English would be Abbott and Costello's "Who's on First?" sketch.
Modern crosstalk is made up of four skills–speaking (Simplified Chinese: 说, Traditional Chinese: 說, pinyin: "shuō"), imitating (Simplified Chinese: 学, Traditional Chinese: 學, pinyin: "xué"), teasing (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 逗, pinyin: "dòu"), and singing (Simplified and Traditional chinese: 唱, pinyin: "chàng").

Oppidum

Oppidum (plural oppida) is a Latin word for the main settlement in any administrative area of ancient Rome. The word comes from "ob-pedum", an "enclosed space." This may in turn have come from the Proto-Indo-European word, "*pedóm-", meaning an "occupied space" or "footprint."
Julius Caesar called the larger Celtic Iron Age settlements he found in Gaul "oppida". The word is now used to describe the large pre-Roman towns that existed across Western and Central Europe. Many oppida grew from hill forts, but not all of them had an important defensive role. The main features of the oppida are:
The development of oppida was an important step in the urbanisation of Europe. They were the first large settlements north of the Mediterranean that could be described as towns. Caesar pointed out that each tribe of Gaul would have several oppida, but that they were not all of equal importance. This suggests that there was some form of hierarchy.
In conquered lands, the Romans took over the oppida to administer the empire, and many became full Roman towns. This often involved a change of location from the hilltop into the plain.
One of the best preserved oppida is at Enserune in France. It was occupied continuously from 6th century BC until the 1st century. Other oppida are now buried beneath large cities, such as Vindobona which is covered by Vienna.

The Mandarin orange, also known as the mandarin or mandarine (both lower-case), is a small citrus tree ("Citrus reticulata") with fruit that looks like other oranges. Mandarin oranges are usually eaten plain or in fruit salads. The mandarin is tender, and is damaged easily by cold. It can be grown in tropical and subtropical areas.
The mandarin is easily peeled with the fingers, and can be easily split into even segments without squirting juice. This makes it more convenient to eat, as utensils are not required to peel or cut the fruit. Mandarin segments are also sold in cans.
During Chinese New Year, Mandarin oranges and tangerines are considered traditional symbols of good fortune. During the two-week celebration, they are frequently displayed as decoration and presented as gifts to friends, relatives, and business partners.

Thermal expansion

In physics, thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in temperature. When a substance is heated, its constituent particles move around more quickly and by doing so generally maintain a greater average . Materials that contract with an increase in temperature are very uncommon; this effect is limited in size, and only occurs within limited temperature ranges. The degree of expansion divided by the change in temperature is called the material's coefficient of thermal expansion and generally varies with temperature. 
Thermometers are an example of using thermal expansion. They contain a liquid which can only move in one direction (along the tube) when volume changes along with temperature.

Algal bloom

An algal bloom is an accumulation of algae (typically microscopic) or a rapid increase in their amount in a body of water. Algal blooms may occur in fresh water as well as salt water. Algal bloom concentrations may reach millions of cells per milliliter of water. Algal blooms are often green, but they can also be other colors such as yellow-brown or red, depending on the species of algae. So-called algal blooms are often caused by Cyanobacteria such as "Aphanizomenon flosaquae", which are no longer considered to be algae. Some kinds of algal blooms, such as red tides, are poisonous.
Algal blooms are often caused by eutrophication. Eutrophication occurs when abnormal amount of nutrients, especially phosphorous and nitrogen, enter a body of water. Algal blooms are a big problem to ecosystems because, like any sudden unnatural growth, it harms the other animals in that ecosystem, usually decreasing their numbers quickly. The abundance of algae in algal blooms causes layers of algae that are unable to get sunlight, and this causes the algae to die and start to decompose. The top layers of algae is able to photosynthesize and continue living. The lack of nutrients and dissolved oxygen in the water inhibits other life. Fish become unable to breathe and other aquatic vegetation cannot photosynthesize. All the organisms in the water start to die and decompose. The decomposition of the dead organisms use up most of the remaining dissolved oxygen in the water. Without a sufficient amount of nutrients and dissolved oxygen all living organisms in the water die which leads to a dead zone.

They have a lot of different kinds of weapons, from World War II to the current era. These include rifles, machine guns, submachine guns, sniper rifles, pistols, grenades, flame throwers, and bazookas. They may also have radio men, minesweepers, and men armed with bayonets. Army men are sometimes packaged with additional accessories including tanks, jeeps, helicopters, half tracks, artillery, helicopters, jets, and buildings.

Samuel Finley Breese Morse (April 27, 1791 – April 2, 1872) was an American inventor. He was the first person to create a telegraph with only one wire, and also helped come up with the brilliant idea of Morse code.
Since the 1700s, there were different types of telegraphs being made, but they were hard to use because they had several wires. (The first telegraph ever built had 26 wires, which made it almost impossible to use.) Morse spent years trying to build one with only one wire, and managed to do it in 1836. Morse and his assistant made a code with "dots and "dashes", which were two different types of "clicks" on the telegraph.
Morse's invention made it possible to quickly communicate with people far away, and many telegraph lines were built. A telegraph line using his invention was built between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore in 1844. By the 1860s, there were telegraph lines all around North America, and in 1866, a telegraph line was built across the Atlantic Ocean.
Samuel F. B. Morse was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts
Morse was a painter before he was an inventor. He was a professor of art at New York University. He wanted to do some paintings that were going to be done at the United States Capitol, but was not chosen to do them. He was so disappointed that he gave up painting.
Morse was a devout Christian. The first message he sent on his 1844 telegraph line was "What hath God wrought?", which comes from the Book of Numbers in the Bible.
He died in New York City on April 2, 1872.

Ryan Stiles

Ryan Lee Stiles (born April 22, 1959) is an American actor, comedian, director, and voice actor whose work is often paired with improvisational comedy. He is best known for his improv and co-production work on the American and British versions of "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" and the role of Lewis Kiniski on "The Drew Carey Show". He played Herb Melnick on the CBS comedy "Two and a Half Men" and was a performer on the show "Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza".
Stiles was born in Seattle, Washington, the youngest of five children. His father, Sonny, was a fishing plant supervisor. Stiles lived in Vancouver, British Columbia as a teenager. At the age of seventeen, he dropped out of his high school, Richmond Secondary, to have a career in comedy. He worked in his father's fish-processing plant to earn a living. He then began performing improv with Vancouver TheatreSports League. In 1986, Stiles successfully auditioned for a berth at Toronto's renowned Second City comedy ensemble.
By 1989, the producers of the comedy show, "Whose Line Is It Anyway?", noticed his work. Stiles was a regular guest on the show until 1998, and the show's short production season allowed him to make numerous television and motion picture appearances in the United States.
In 1995, Stiles was asked by American comic Drew Carey to be a regular on his comedy "The Drew Carey Show". Stiles played Drew's smart but under best friend, Lewis Kiniski. Stiles' first line in the first episode of the show, "And that's why the French don't wash," is a line he had used in an episode of the British version of "Whose Line?".
In 1998, Carey successfully got ABC to get an American version of "Whose Line?" produced. Following the final season of the British version in 1998, the American version premiered, with both Stiles and Carey as executive producers. Stiles and Colin Mochrie were the only two actors to appear in every episode of the US version, though Wayne Brady also became a regular near the beginning of the second season. The series was produced until 2006.
Stiles was the most iconic performer on the original UK version of "Whose Line?", appearing in 76 of the series 136 episodes (including compilations). He first appeared in the fifth episode of the second season, which aired in late 1988. He appeared in one other episode of that season, before returning for four episodes of the third season. His prominence increased with each season, including appearances in every episode of Season 4 which was filmed in New York; ultimately appearing in every episode from the seventh season onwards.
Stiles was known for several recurring impressions he performed on the shows, performed both at his own decision and as an assignment in games. These included Carol Channing, Elvis Presley, John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Steve Irwin and Christopher Lloyd's character in "Taxi", Jim Ignatowski. He made clear his dislike of the musical segments of the show at every opportunity whenever he was chosen to perform in them, mostly because of his inability to form lyrics quickly. In particular, he disliked the games Hoedown and Irish Drinking Song, often reacting negatively (or sarcastically positively) to its being announced. Other than in early UK playings, Stiles was always the last performer to sing in Hoedown and other similar musical games, allowing him more time to devise lyrics, and giving him the final punch-lines, as well as injecting (usually not-so subtle) jabs at the Hoedown itself, or of the host for having him perform in it.
Stiles had first met Colin Mochrie years before while performing stand-up. They first performed together in Vancouver TheaterSports then in Second City, Toronto.There were a number of games which paired Mochrie and Stiles at every playing. Though other performers did so, he was the most common performer to make bald jokes at Mochrie. In return, Mochrie often made jokes about Stiles's height, nose, attractiveness, and tendency to wear exotic, flamboyant shoes, which were designed by George Esquivel. However, he would sometimes stand up to or make jokes at the other performers (including Drew Carey) who made fun of Mochrie's baldness or Mochrie in general, mostly during Scenes From A Hat.
Stiles received a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program in 2002 for his work on the show.
In 1981, Stiles met Patricia McDonald at Punchlines where she was waitressing. They lived together for seven years before marrying in 1988. They have three children: Sam, Mackenzie, and Claire. When not working in Hollywood, he lives at his home on Lake Sammamish, outside Bellingham, Washington, where he has opened the Upfront Theatre, a small theatre dedicated to live improv comedy.
Stiles once lived in a house previously owned by Liberace in Sherman Oaks, California, but he sold it.
Stiles appeared in the 1991 film "Hot Shots" as Mailman Farnham, and also starred in the 1993 sequel (follow-up) "Hot Shots! Part Deux", as marine Rabinowitz.
Since 2004, Stiles has been seen as the reappearing character Dr. Herb Melnick in several episodes of the comedy "Two and a Half Men" which stars his "Hot Shots" co-star Jon Cryer and formerly Charlie Sheen. Stiles also made short guest appearances on "Murphy Brown", "Mad About You", "Mad TV", and "Dharma & Greg". In July 2008, he was a guest star on "Reno 911!" as Sergeant Clift, an acting coach.
During the 1994 Major League Baseball strike Stiles appeared in several commercials for Nike, hanging out in an empty ballpark doing things such as playing the organ and attempting to do the wave alone. The commercials ended with the tag line: "Play ball. Please."

Canoe racing

Canoe racing is a water sport. The sport normally takes place on water that is moving very slowly or not moving at all. The goal of the sport is to move the canoe a given distance in the shortest time. This sport is an Olympic event. At one time, wooden boats were used for racing. Over time, people started using boats made of carbon fibers. These boats are lighter and tougher than wooden boats.
There are two main types of races. These are canoe (C1, C2, C4) and kayak (K1, K2, K4). The number tells how many people are on the boat. In a kayak, a person sits. In a canoe, a person kneels on one knee. A kayak has a rudder. It is used to steer the boat. A canoeist (person who uses a canoe) uses the paddle to move the boat. This is done by moving the paddle from the bow to the stern (front to back). After each race, the boats are looked at to make certain they are legal. If a boat does not have enough weight, the racer is disqualified and cannot win the race.
Races are divided into several groups based on how long they are.
In short distance races, the races are either 200 m, 500 m or 1000 m long. The path of the race is laid out using buoys. Each person has a separate path to follow from the starting line to the finish. On longer races, there may be a point where the paths cross each other to let the person turn their boat.
Long distance races are 5000 m long. Marathon races are at least 15 km. Men's marathon has a minimum length of 20 km. Women's marathon has a minimum of 15 km. Most major races are 30 km or longer. There is no maximum distance for marathon races. There is a marathon race that is about 1000 km long on in the Yukon. The longer races are usually broken up into several parts and may be raced over several days. In long distance and marathon races, all racers start at the same time. They do not use "intervals" where the racers are started at different times.

<doc id="315927" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=315927" title="Geocaching">
Geocaching

Geocaching is an outdoor sport activity based on GPS (Global Positioning System). Players use a receiver or mobile device and other navigational techniques to hide or look for containers, called "geocaches" or "caches".
One of the main ideas of geocaching is putting caches in places that are interesting, but not often visited by tourists. In the listing of the cache, information about the places is given.
After 13 years of activity there are over 2,000,000 active geocaches. There are over 5 million geocachers worldwide.
Geocaching was invented shortly after the removal of artificial error from GPS on May 2, 2000. Accuracy of the GPS before this date was about 100m, after this date is less than 3m. Improved accuracy allowed geocachers to specify where caches are located.
The first cache was placed on May 3, 2000, by Dave Ulmer in Beavercreek. It was found by Mike Teague of Vancouver on May 6, 2000. The original name of the game is "GPS Stash Hunt", but it was changed on May 30, 2000 after the discussion of several players to "Geocaching". 
The cache is usually in a waterproof plastic container with a logbook where geocachers write their registered nickname and date they find it. Larger containers usually contain items for trading like plastic toys, hockey cards or special trackable items called Travel Bugs or Geocoins. Trackable items are logged on the website and moved from cache to cache.
The coordinates of a hidden cache with the rating of the difficulty and terrain and information about size are placed by owner at the official website Geocaching.com. After checking by a reviewer, they are published and available for other geocachers.
Traditional cache: The basic cache type, hidden on the place defined by coordinates in header of listing.
Multi cache: The geocacher usually has to go over the stages, find some information at every stage (such as number on information board etc.) and at the finish calculate the coordinates of the final cache.
Mystery/puzzle cache (also called "Unknown cache"): The coordinates of the final cache are usually hidden in some cipher, image or text and the geocacher has to discover it.
Letterbox hybrid cache: A combination of geocaching and letterboxing in the same container. Instead of a classic cache there is a stamp, which the finder can print to his or her diary.
Webcam cache: It is not a typical cache where the geocacher has to find a hidden box with a logbook. Instead, he has to find a webcam on the published coordinates and take a photo of himself.
Virtual cache: Similar to webcam cache, there is no hidden box at the coordinates. The geocacher only has to find out information such as the name on a monument and send it to the owner of the cache.
Earth cache: Very similar to virtual cache, but in a geographically interesting place. The geocacher has to find out answers for the questions in a listing, take a photo here, and send it to the owner of the cache.
Event cache: Meeting organized and attended by geocachers. There is also special type of event – CITO (Cache in, trash out), where geocachers have to clean up an area. An event attended by more than 500 people is called a Mega-event, and an event attended by more than 5000 people is called a Giga-event

Cardinal-nephew

A cardinal-nephew (; ;) was a pope's relative -- a nephew -- who was raised to the rank of cardinal. The practice of creating cardinal-nephews originated in the Middle Ages.
Cardinal-nephew was an office in the Curia of the Roman Catholic Church before 1692. After the death of the reigning pope, the office of cardinal-nephew was vacated. 
The pope's cardinal-nephew was his chief assistant and confident. The man in this role was expected to act as if he were a relative of the pope; and sometimes -- often, he was in fact a member of the pope's extended family. 
After 1692, this office was banned by Pope Innocent XII in "Romanum decet pontificem." 
This role and function is now filled by the Vatican's Secretary of State.
Notable cardinal-nephews include many who would later become popes:

Many chemical reactions produce energy in the form of heat. This warmth is sometimes called chemical energy.

El Cid

Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar (AD. 1043 – July 10, 1099), known as El Cid Campeador, was a Spanish general. Exiled from the court, El Cid went on to command a Moorish force. After the Christian defeat, El Cid was recalled to service. He took command of a combined Christian and Moorish army. He used this army to create his own fiefdom in Valencia. He was a brave general that lead his country to victory. El Cid was born in Vivar, also known as Castillona de Bivar. The Muslims gave him the nickname "El Cid" from the Spanish Arabic word al-sid, meaning "lord." 
After his father, Diego Laínez was killed in 1058, El Cid was an orphan. He was then taken to the court of King Ferdinand I of Castile, and Ferdinand’s eldest son, Prince Sancho II became in charge of him. El Cid studied alongside Sancho III, Prince Sancho II’s son, and they soon became friends. El Cid then proved to become a fantastic warrior.
When King Ferdinand (Ferdinand VI of Spain) of Castile died in 1065 the kingdom was divided into three parts, Castile for Sancho, Leon for Alfonso, and Galicia for García. El Cid became Sancho’s armiger regis, meaning standard bearer, and also became general of the army. 
But King Sancho wanted to reunite all the three parts of his dead father's kingdom. He attacked his older brother Alfonso and defeated him and his army at Llantada in 1068. In 1072, with the help of El Cid, Sancho defeated Alfonso again at Golpejera. King Alfonso then sent his brother into exile. A Zamora knight slaughtered Sancho in October. 
After his brother's death, Alfonso returned from exile attempting to claim his dead brothers throne. El Cid then swore Alfonso to the throne and named him King.
Although, Alfonso feared that El Cid would not prove loyal, but with no proof. In 1074, El Cid married Alfonso's niece, Jimena. Some believe the marriage was encouraged by Alfonso to bring El Cid under his watchful eye. Alfonso never gave El Cid a chance to make a better name for himself in the military, and kept him from becoming famous. 
El Cid soon became fed up, and in 1081, without Alfonso's permission, he invaded the city of Toledo.
This made Alfonso very mad, and his advisors told him that El Cid had tried to betray him by attacking the city without his permission, false information. Alfonso then banished him from the city of Castile. 
El Cid then worked as a paid, professional soldier for the Muslim king of Saragossa. During the time that had past, El Cid defeated Christian attacks and continued to make himself better known and more famous as a general. This caused other kings and generals to fear that El Cid would overtake them with his power.
In October 1086, Alfonso had a battle with the Almoravids. They attacked each other at Sagrajas, where Alfonso was defeated. The loss made Alfonso reconsider banishing El Cid. Alfonso called him back, hoping El Cid could defeat the Almoravids. However, the trust issues led the two men to go their separate ways yet again. The Alfonso and El Cid were meet together with their armies, but they failed to because of miscommunication. People convinced King Alfonso that El Cid had planned to not show up, and let Alfonso and his army be defeated. Once again, Alfonso exiled El Cid.
El Cid and his small army left, and invaded land in eastern Spain. Four years later, he ruled a large, wealthy plot of land, it’s capital being Valencia.
He ruled well, allowing Muslims and Christians to mingle. King Alfonso begged for El Cid’s help in his ongoing battle with the Almoravids. Meanwhile, the kingdom El Cid had worked so hard to build was falling apart from Muslim revolts. El Cid went back to Valencia and returned the city to peace.
El Cid continued to conquer many cities before his death on July 10, 1099 in Valencia. El Cid's life story inspired many playwrights and poems.

Uncanny valley

The uncanny valley is a psychological theory about the effect involving art and robots and human emotions. As something starts to look more human-like, there is a point at which people start to feel it looks wrong. At this point, they have negative feelings toward the object. These feelings keep getting worse as the object is made to look more human-like. At a certain point, as the object starts to get very close to looking human-like, how people feel towards it tend to reverse and they have more positive emotional feelings towards it. The theory was created by the robotics professor Masahiro Mori in 1970.
One of the main points of the theory to explain this is that people are not as affected in an emotional way by the object if it is easy to tell it is not human. After a certain point, people start to feel emotionally about it, but feel negatively because it is so nonhuman. As it gets closer to looking human, they start to feel more positive emotions towards it. A graph of these feeling shows a valley. This is part of the reason for the naming of the theory.

James Black

Sir James Whyte Black, OM, FRS, FRSE, FRCP (14 June 1924 – 22 March 2010) was a Scottish doctor and pharmacologist. Black started in the physiology department at the University of Glasgow. While there, he became interested in how adrenaline affected the human heart. He went to work for ICI Pharmaceuticals in 1958. While working for ICI, he created propranolol. Propranolol is a beta blocker, used to treat heart disease. Black also created cimetidine. It is a drug used to treat stomach ulcers. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1988 for creating these drugs.
Black was born in Uddingston, Lanarkshire. He was the fourth of five sons of a Baptist family. His father was a mining engineer. He grew up in Fife. Black went to Beath High School, Cowdenbeath. At the age of 15, he won a scholarship to the University of St Andrews. At St Andrews, he studied medicine. He graduated in 1946.
After graduating he joined the Physiology department at University College as an Assistant Lecturer. He later took a lecturer position at the University of Malaya. Black had decided against a career as a medical practitioner as he objected to what he perceived as the insensitive treatment of patients at the time.
After graduation, Black took a teaching job in Singapore for three years. He moved to London in 1950. Later in 1950, he returned to Scotland. He joined the University of Glasgow (Veterinarian School). There that he became interesteed in how adrenaline affects the human heart. He was mainly interesting in how it affected people with angina. He found the effects of adrenaline did not help. He joined ICI Pharmaceuticals in 1958. He worked with the company until 1964. During this time, he created propranolol, which became the world's best-selling drug. While at ICI, Black developed a new way of doing research. Before this, drug molecules would be created and then tested to find in what ways the molecules could be used as medicine. Black chose to pick a medical use and then try to create the molecules for that medicine. The discovery of propranolol was said to be the greatest discovery in the treatment of heart disease since the discovery of digitalis.
At the same time, Black was trying to find a treatment for stomach ulcers. ICI did not wish to do this so Black stopped working for them in 1964. He joined Smith, Kline and French. He worked for them for nine years until 1973. While there, Black developed his second major drug, cimetidine. It was first sold under the brand name Tagamet in 1975. Tagamet soon outsold propranolol to become the world's largest-selling prescription drug.
Black became the department head of pharmacology at University College London in 1973. He created a new undergraduate course in medicinal chemistry. He had many problems trying to get money for research, so he quit. He went to work for Wellcome Research Laboratories in 1978. He worked there until 1984. Black then became Professor of Analytical Pharmacology at the Rayne Institute of King's College London medical school. He stayed there until 1992. He created the James Black Foundation in 1988 with money from Johnson and Johnson. He worked with 25 scientists in drugs research. This research included gastrin inhibitors which may stop some stomach cancers.
Black helped increase basic scientific and clinical knowledge in cardiology. His creation of propranolol is thought to be one of the most important contributions to clinical medicine and pharmacology of the 20th century. Propranolol has helped millions of people.
Black was made a Knight Bachelor on 10 February 1981 for services to medical research. He received the honour from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. On 26 May 2000 he was appointed to the Order of Merit by the Queen.
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1976. That same year he was awarded the Lasker award. In 1979, he was awarded the Artois-Baillet Latour Health Prize. In 1982 Black was awarded the Wolf Prize in Medicine. He was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings for their work on drug development. In 1994 he received the Ellison-Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine.

Video camera

A video camera is camera used to make electronic motion pictures. It captures moving images and synchronous sound. Early video cameras were all analog and most modern ones are digital. Analog video cameras produce signals that can be displayed with analog televisions. The signals can be shown at the time, or can be stored in an analog format on magnetic tape. Digital video cameras produce digital images.
Video cameras were invented early in the 20th century for television use, and by the end of the century, people could buy digital video cameras, which can almost immediately display the image. Video recorders that could record the image on magnetic tape were created in the middle 20th century.
At first, video cameras were large and expensive. Only professionals operated them. As the electronics industry advanced, and solid state circuits with transistors and microprocessors replaced vacuum tubes, video cameras became smaller and inexpensive. Now many mobile phones and other consumer electronic devices include video cameras. In addition, software is now widely available to edit or to compress the output from video cameras.
Modern video cameras have numerous designs and uses, not all of which resemble the early television cameras. 
Special uses of video cameras include systems that capture images at the finish line to time races and sporting events. Some toll roads use video cameras to make pictures of the license plate of any car that fails to pay tolls. Computers then identify the drivers and mail enforcement letters to collect the missed tolls.

Aggression

Aggression refers to behavior between members of the same species that is intended to cause humiliation, pain, or harm.
Ferguson and Beaver defined aggressive behavior as ""Behavior which is intended to increase the social dominance of the organism relative to the dominance position of other organisms"”
Aggression takes a variety of forms among humans and can be physical, mental, or verbal.
There are two types of aggression - hostile, affective aggression and instrumental, predatory, or goal-oriented aggression.
Reactive relational aggression (hostile, affective, retaliatory) is used in response to feeling attacked, threatened, or mad. Usually the person who exhibits this type of aggression feels provoked to do so. Instrumental relational aggression (predatory, goal-oriented) is used in order for an individual to get what they want.
Predatory or defensive behavior between members of different species is not normally considered as "aggression."
Like most, or even all behaviors, aggression can be examined in terms of its ability to help an animal reproduce and survive. Animals may use aggression to gain and secure territories, as well as other resources including food, water, and mating opportunities.
The most apparent type of aggression is that seen in the interaction between a predator and its prey. An animal defending itself against a predator becomes aggressive in order to survive and predator in order to secure food. Because aggression against a much larger enemy or group of enemies would be nearly certain to lead to the death of an animal, animals have developed a good sense of when they are outnumbered. This ability to gauge the strength of other animals gives animals a "fight or flight" response to predators; depending on how strong they gauge the predator to be, animals will either become aggressive or flee.
Although humans share aspects of aggression with non-human animals, they differ from most of them in the complexity of their aggression because of factors such as culture, morals, and social situations.

Focal length

Focal length tells how strongly a lens, a curved mirror or another optical device brings light together or spreads it out. If rays of light go straight into a lens and the focal length is positive, the focal length is the distance to the point behind the lens where the rays will be brought to a focus. If the focal length of the lens is negative, the focal length is the distance at which the light has spread to twice its original size. Light from a large distance produces an image at F (focal point). The distance from the centre of the lens to F is the focal length

The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a collection of information about the three dimensional (3-D) structure of large biological molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. Biologists and biochemists from around the world send in the data. Most data comes from X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. Anyone can access the PDB for free online. The Worldwide Protein Data Bank, wwPDB, manages the PDB.
The PDB is useful for scientists studying structural biology and structural genomics. Many scientists have to send their information to the database. Major scientific journals and some funding agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health in the United States have rules telling scientists to send the data to the PDB. The PDB has the original or primary data. Hundreds of other databases reuse the data. These secondary databases organize the information in different ways. For example, both SCOP and CATH put structures into groups organized by type of structure and ideas about how they are related through evolution. Gene ontology puts the data into groups based on genes.

At that time, Singapore was part of Malaysia. The team from Malaysia included people from Singapore. When Singapore became independent from Malaysia in 1965, the country began sending its own team again. It sent a team for every summer games after then, except in 1980. The country boycotted the 1980 games along with many other countries. No athletes from Singapore have been in any Winter Olympic Games.
The country has won four Olympic medals. The first medal was won by Tan Howe Liang, who won a silver medal in lightweight weightlifting in 1960. In table tennis, Jing Jun Hong and Li Jiawei came close to winning medals in Sydney in 2000. They finished in fourth place. They also finished fourth in the 2004 Athens Olympics. Singapore sent many athletes to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. It was felt that this was their best chance of winning a medal since 1960. This proved to be true.
In the Beijing, Li, together with Feng Tianwei and Wang Yuegu, beat the South Korea Women's Table Tennis team in the semi-finals. Because of this, they made it to the final match and would win at least the silver medal. Singapore lost to host China in the gold medal final.

Philip Showalter Hench

Philip Showalter Hench (February 28, 1896 – March 30, 1965) was an American physician. Hench won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1950. He won the award along with his Mayo Clinic co-worker Edward Calvin Kendall and Swiss chemist Tadeus Reichstein . They won it for finding the hormone cortisone and its use for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis."
Hench went to university at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. He was trained as a physician at the United States Army Medical Corps and the University of Pittsburgh. Hench began working at Mayo Clinic in 1923. He later became the head of the Department of Rheumatology.
He attended Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. At Lafayette, he earned his Bachelor of Arts in 1916. After that, he served in the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army and the reserve corps to finish his medical training. He got a doctorate in medicine from the University of Pittsburgh in 1920. After getting his medical degree, Hench spent a year as an intern at St. Francis Hospital in Pittsburgh. Next, he became a Fellow of the Mayo Foundation.
In 1928 and 1929, Hench studied at Freiburg University and the von Müller Clinic in Munich.
Hench started his career at Mayo Clinic in 1923. He worked in the Department of Rheumatic Diseases. In 1926, he became the head of the department. While at Mayo Clinic, Hench worked mainly on arthritic diseases. This lead him to believe that steroids lessened the pain caused by the disease. During this time, biochemist Edward Calvin Kendall has found several steroids created by the adrenal gland cortex. After several years of work, Hench and Kendall decided to use one of these steroids on patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Testing of the hypothesis was delayed because the synthesis of Compound E was costly and time-consuming, and Hench served in the military during World War II. The tests were conducted successfully in 1948 and 1949. The steroid they used was named Compound E at the time. It later become known as cortisone.
Hench, Kendall and Swiss chemist Tadeus Reichstein won the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for their discoveries relating to the hormones of the adrenal cortex, their structure and biological effects." As of the 2010 prizes, Hench and Kendall are the only two Nobel winners who worked with Mayo Clinic. 
During his career, Hench was one of the founding members of the American Rheumatism Association. He was its president in 1940 and 1941. 
Hench has also gotten the Heberdeen Medal (1942), the Lasker Award (1949), the Passano Foundation Award (1950), and the Criss Award. Lafayette College, Washington and Jefferson College, Western Reserve University, the National University of Ireland and the University of Pittsburgh given Hench honorary doctorates.

Kaštanka

Kaštanka is a forest. It has one of the highest lying sets of chestnuts in central Europe. It is in a small town called Nasavrky. Nasavrky is in eastern Bohemia, Czech Republic. It is about 25 km south of county seat Pardubice. 
Jan Adam von Auersperg came back from Italy with six seedlings of chestnut at the end of 18th century. He ordered that the seedlings were planted on the north side of Nasavrky hill. This happened between 1776 to 1778. The plants were the start of Kaštanka. In passing time, the set was expanded a lot. Kaštanka had over 110 trees in the turn of 19th and 20th century.
Kaštanka was made a nature monument on 1 December 1990. At that time, Kaštanka had over 138 trees. One of the first planted trees survives to this day. It was named "Knížák" in honor of prince Auersperg.
The chestnut became the sign of Nasavrky. It became the main motive in the emblem of the city Nasavrky, and the flag of Nasavrlky in 1996.
Kaštanka is natural monument which was declared as special protection area on 1st December 1990. The set of chestnuts is on a slight rise north ward. This area is in a built-up area about 100 meters from the city square. Kaštanka is at an altitude of 472 – 486. The area of set is 1,088 hectares large and all trees are chestnut trees expect a few that are on the edge.
Kaštanka was main theme of many artists like painters, sculptors and writers. Some writers wrote novels about Kaštanka. Two of the authors that did this were Marie Doležalová and Alois Stanislav Novák. Kaštanka gave Věra Vovsová, Jiří Poláček and Karel Pavlík the inspiration to make art.

Prequel

Prequel is a term in drama and literature: it means the opposite of sequel. When a story is told in several stages, it is natural to tell it in order of time. For example, a series of books on the Second World War started with the 1930s, and ended up in 1946. 
For various reasons, this does not always happen. In the movie series "Star Wars", the first movie was ' (1977). It was followed by three prequels, which were ' (1999); ' (2002) and ' (2005).
For correct use, the term 'prequel' is only applied when work is part of a series, and when the later publication refers to an earlier time. It is an old idea, but one which is often used today for drama on movie and television. The "Cypria", a work of Ancient Greek literature, is a prequel to Homer's "Iliad". A related idea is the back-story, which is the background story of a main story or character.

Blind men and an elephant

The Blind men and an elephant is an idiom.
The story of the blind men and an elephant comes from India. It is about a range of truths and mistakes. It is also about the need for communication and the need for respect for different perspectives. 
The idiom shows the effects of observation and bias. Idioms are a common stumbling block for learners of a language.
A group of blind men (or men in the dark) touch an elephant to learn what it is like. Each one feels a different part, but only one part. For example, one touches only the side and another touches only the tusk. 
The blind men discover that they disagree when each describes what he has learned from touching the elephant.
A famous version of story is a poem -- "The Blind Men and the Elephant" by John Godfrey Saxe (1816–1887).
The poem begins:
It was six men of Indostan
To learning much inclined,
Who went to see the Elephant
(Though all of them were blind),
That each by observation
Might satisfy his mind
They conclude that the elephant is like a wall, snake, spear, tree, fan or rope, depending upon where they touch. None of blind men's description is correct for the whole elephant.

<doc id="316307" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316307" title="Kaskaskia, Illinois">
Kaskaskia, Illinois

Kaskaskia is a village in Randolph County, Illinois, United States. In 2010 the population was only 14, making it the second-smallest incorporated community in Illinois. It was a major French colonial town of the Illinois Country. Its peak population was about 7,000 when it was a regional center. Kaskaskia became the capital of the Illinois Territory on February 3, 1809. In 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state and Kaskaskia was its capital until 1819. 
In April 1881, the Mississippi River moved its path to the east. This flooded most of the town. The river now passes east rather than west of the town. The state boundary line, however, remained in its original location. Kaskaskia is on a small part of Illinois west of the river. It can only be reached from Missouri.
The town was named after the Native American word for the Kaskaskia River. The site of Kaskaskia had been a Native American village for thousands of years. In 1703 French Jesuit missionaries started a mission. They wanted to change the Illini (Native American) people's religion to Catholicism. The first stone church was built in 1714. The French also had a fur trading post at the village. French settlers came to farm and mine lead on the Missouri side of the river. In 1718 Kaskaskia became the capital of Upper Louisiana and a fort, Fort de Chartres,was built.
From its beginning, Kaskaskia was a French/Indian settlement, with a few French men and many Illinois and other Native Americans. In 1707, the population was about 2,200. Most were Illinois, who lived somewhat apart from the Europeans. From the French, the Native Americans, and their mixed-race descendants at Kaskaskia came the voyageurs and coureurs des bois. They explored and hunted in the Missouri River country. The French wanted to trade with all the Prairie tribes, and with the Spanish colony in New Mexico. This idea horrified the Spanish. The explorer Claude Charles Du Tisne set up trade relations with the Plains Indians in 1719.
King Louis XV sent a bell to Kaskaskia in 1741 for its church. During French rule, Kaskaskia and the other farming settlements in the Illinois Country were important for supplying Lower Louisiana, especially New Orleans, with wheat and corn. Farmers sent tons of flour south over the years. These staple crops could not grow in Louisiana's climate.
In 1733, the French built Fort Kaskaskia. The British destroyed the fort in 1763 during the French and Indian War. After the war France gave up the territory east of the river. Many French-speaking people from Kaskaskia and other colonial towns moved west of the Mississippi to the Spanish-held, Upper Louisiana settlements of Ste. Genevieve, St. Louis, and other areas.
On July 4 1778, during the American Revolution, the city was captured by George Rogers Clark and his force of 200 men including Captain Leonard Helm. It was one of the western-most battles of the Revolution. The parish rang the church bell in celebration, which has since been called the "liberty bell". The bell is housed in a brick building near the Church of the Immaculate Conception. The brick church was built in 1843 in the squared-off French style.
As a center of the regional economy, Kaskaskia was the capital of Illinois Territory from 1809 until Illinois became a state in 1818. Zaskaskia continued as the state capital until 1819. Its peak population was about 7,000 before the capital moved in 1819 to Vandalia. Although introduction of steamboats on the Mississippi River helped the economies of river towns in the 19th century, their use also had devastating environmental effects. Loss of trees (Deforestation) along the river banks was caused by steamboat crews' cutting trees to feed the engine fires. River banks became unstable and collapsed into the water.
At first, the town had a good site where the Kaskaskia and Mississippi Rivers joined. But from St. Louis to the junction of the Ohio River, the Mississippi became wider and more shallow, with more severe flooding. Much of Kaskaskia and other French colonial towns have been lost through flooding and erosion. Following the Great Flood of 1844, Kaskaskia was rebuilt to the south. The original site became an island, surrounded by the Mississippi River. The flood of 1881 destroyed the original town, and the Mississippi shifted into the channel of the Kaskaskia River, passing east instead of west of the town. Parts of the town were rebuilt in the new area.
As the Mississippi continued to flow through its new bed, earth was deposited so that the village became physically attached to the west bank of the river, which is in the state of Missouri. Now a bayou, the old river bed, is regularly flooded. It has a bridge to carry traffic over it. In 1893, the people of the town moved and rebuilt the Church of the Immaculate Conception on Kaskaskia Island.
By 1950 only 112 people lived in Kaskaskia. By 1970 the population had fallen to 79, and it continued to fall to 33 in 1980. The town was flooded with nine feet of water by the Great Flood of 1993, which reached the roofs of the buildings. By 2000, with a only nine residents, Kaskaskia was almost a ghost town and the least populous incorporated community in the State of Illinois.
Kaskaskia is located at .
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total land area of 0.2809 km² (0.1085 sq mi, or 69.41 acres), all land. However, the village is only a small part of Kaskaskia Precinct, which includes all of Randolph County's land west of the Mississippi. Kaskaskia Precinct has a land area of 24.037 square miles (62.255 km²) and a 2000 census population of 36 persons. In 1993 the Mississippi River almost completely flooded the island.

For example, if a date is given but the dated category is not defined, and there's no category that holds all tagged articles (dated or not), then the article doesn't show up in a defined category.

I have a near conspiratorial grievance with Wikipedia. There seems to be a concerted and consistent effort to purge certain unpopular facts about people's backgrounds in their articles. The facts shouldn't be altered by the current cultural marxist zeitgeist. If they are going to report anybody's ethnicity, they should report everybody's ethnicity. If someone is part "Jewish" but has "other" ancestors, they don't become just "Jewish". Their "other" ancestors' ethnicities must be reported. If you're going to report on one of their ancestors, you must report on them all, or you undermine your objectivity and credibility. All I demand is uniformity and fairness, that is all. I find these trends disturbing. I have altered multiple articles that comport to this trend. This is my official formal complaint and mandate that Wikipedia follow this paradigm. I'm left wondering, are some "special", "chosen" ancestors more important than others? And remember, you can't choose your genetic and ethnic history. It's a matter of fact, not opinion. You can identify culturally with a group but that does not render you ethnically of that group at all, let alone entirely. Don't conflate the two. That's also fact, not opinion. The website might even be wise to segregate the two. No more promoting some groups and their successes and denigrating or censoring others. Just facts, how's that? That's what encyclopedias are supposed to be about.
I am upset about a particular webpage. I am not an expert, and I don't claim to be an expert, but simple math and first hand knowledge result in me concluding that the webpage in question is wildly inaccurate. In particular, I am speaking about the webpage for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In one part of the page the claim is made that only 3% of the population is not Muslim. In another portion of the page, the claim is made that 20% (1/5) of the population is non-resident (immigrant-work permit). Having grown up in Saudi Arabia, I will concur to the second claim, but I question how the initial claim can be true if the second claim is true. I don't believe it can be. I also object to references of suppression of other belief systems in the KSA. I have several photographs in my possession documenting "open" and "other" holidays which were celebrated in the KSA. In particular, my favorite photograph has on display a Halloween float. This float has a "Happy halloween" sign written in arabic. The people who are standing in front of the float are (presumably, from attire) from India, America/or Europe, and from Saudi Arabia. 
There is a great tolerance for other faiths in the KSA. If, as a Christian, I can presume, I would quote from the Qu'ran:
“Say: ‘Unbelievers, I do not worship what you worship, no do you worship what I worship. I shall never worship what you worship, nor will you ever worship what I worship. You have your own religion and I have mine.” (Qur’an 110:1-6)
. . . Do not say to one who offers you peace, “You are not a believer,” seeking the spoils of this life. For God has abundant treasure. You used to be like them, after all, and then God blessed you. [Qur’an 4:94]
I do not understand how I can put any faith into Wiki content, when such blatant misrepresentations are allowed to continue without contemplative editing.
As I'm sure most have seen, we have a ton of . I haven't touched them because they raise a question that I've never seen before. Do we want to categorize images? Our QD policy says we can't upload locally, it doesn't say we can't create the File space pages and categorize them. What does the community think?

Some big words have special meanings and connotations to them. To use another word would be difficult, because the big word is the perfect word that fits the context. Take "recidivism", for example. This may look like a mouthful, but really it means the tendency to return to former behavior. I have a hunch that this Simple English Wikipedia, if it wants to describe certain words with special meanings, would have to make the articles more wordier rather than sticking to brevity.

However, it is really helpful to those of us who watch a large number of pages. I would think we ought to make it mandatory, at least for anonymous users. Alternatively, its importance should be stressed to every new user in the welcome flag. Only a brief note is needed to let watchers know the rough significance of the edit.

I have been thinking about creating a team effort project that we all can collaborate in. The project is about expanding articles (and other articles not listed but are of importance in life) to status. An encyclopedia should be a place where people can get comprehensive information about a topic of choice, and since Simple contains "mostly" stub articles, I think its time to worry more about adding information then creating stubs that drive newcomers away to English Wikipedia. I've been thinking about having a two-month (December 1, 2011 - February 1, 2012) long drive called "Very Good Article Drive" (VGAD) and separating topics into groups. For an example: (these are just examples of articles that would be considered in the list; furthermore, we don't need 4 groups if consensus agree)
These groups could have a min of 3 users (per group) who work together in expanding the articles in their group to VGA status. However, users who work in a group can't work at another since that would be violating . At the end of the drive, each group must review other groups articles and gather consensus on weather or not the article meets the criteria; this can lower chances that articles will remain at the nominations for a very long time. This isn't a "project" that needs its own page here, moreover, this team effort is just a collaboration to get vital articles to VGA status. One of the benefits of this are; (1) working as a team (2) building Simple Wikipedia as an encyclopedia (3) gaining viewership and users who aren't acquainted with Simple to join and best of all (4) it'll be fun :-) (my PoV) So what do you guys think? If you are interested in helping just say which group you would like to join. Best, 22:50, 29 November 2011 (UTC)

Hello,
Our VGA requirement number 10 ("Content that is from books, journal articles or other publications needs to be referenced. This can either be done with tags, or as a list of publications. For articles that have references or external links on the English Wikipedia, there must be at least one in the Simple English article as well.") references the regular English language wikipedia. I think that this can lead to confusion. Potentially, we may have a VGA-candidate that does not exist on another wikipedia. Take the case of an editor coming from another Wikipedia (Chinese, Arabic, Russian, Ido...) improving an article that only exists in that Wikipedia to a standard that it can be a VGA candidate? - What about Simple having articles that do not exist in other Wikipedias? - Can those articles not reach VGA status? - For that reason I propose to get rid of the second part of the requirement ("For articles that ...").

Hi there,
I'd like to advice you about this message that I sent to the WM Foundation mailing list a few week ago.
It is about kind of equivalent to "simple" in dutch, french and spanish, but intended for children.
By the way, I found this other message (Jun 2010) which says : ""Considering the historical role of the children's encyclopedia, we might consider rescoping "simple" as "for children" -- this could help to increase participation and use, and clarify the role of these projects.""
What do you think about it ? () 23:23, 10 December 2011 (UTC)
I'm sorry...I'm not seeing the point here. If you think there is a need for a WikiKids in English, go make one at Vikidia. But we're not going to change our ways or mission because someone coming in from the outside says we should. Additionally, the US has not ratified the Convention on the Rights..., and since Wikimedia is based in the US, the conventions have no relevance here. And it's not like we're preventing children from using Wikipedia...they can and do. They have the right to seek, receive and impart information...no where does it say "this information must be put into ways they'd understand." () 12:31, 11 December 2011 (UTC)
My input is that this Simpple English Wikipedia should not be rescoped. I've seen several editors here who appreciate us because their first language is not English. I don't remember seeing any say they appreciate us because they're children. As far as articles that a target audience might not "be ready for": as an official policy, .
If a children's Wiki were to be established elsewhere, I believe the licensing on Wikipedia would allow articles from here to be used there if credit is given. (Someone please correct me if that's wrong.) The other Wiki could pick and choose which articles they wanted from here. -- () 21:35, 11 December 2011 (UTC)

I have so many people telling me so many different things about this, we need consensus to see what the "rule" is for certain. For three (American) holidays I have wished my fellow Americans a happy <Fourth of July/Thanksgiving> only to have it either reverted or complained about by either Dj or scream. I then find people that find nothing wrong with it (i.e. Normandy or Gordon), it's confusing so I need to know for certain through consensus, am I or am I not allowed to celebrate a holiday with a small thread like this on ST? Thanks. | 23:38, 24 November 2011 (UTC)
There isn't anything wrong with wishing people a happy holiday. It cheers me up and reminds me that this place isn't all serious. If people were allowed to put things like "happy holidays!", "seasons greetings!" and "merry Christmas!" in their signatures at Christmas, then why is it not allowed to wish people a happy Thanksgiving on Simple Talk? - 11:24, 25 November 2011 (UTC)

Wikipedia is supposed to be apolitical and neutral. Wishing someone a Happy Whatever is a violation of and technically in that its a social thing not related to the building of an encyclopedia.

Is this the place to ask someone to correct a small spelling error in an article title? Is this called a "move"? The article about the Japanese era name "Hōtoku" should be spelled with a diacritic line above the first vowel ("") -- see In other words, "Hotoku" should be a redirect for "Hōtoku".

Personally I would rather it not be on the sidebar so it doesn't get confused with simple talk. Simple talk is where people should come with questions and looking for help. Administrator notice board on the other hand is for things that need to be brought to administrator attention such as needing admin intervention in a dispute or clearing up a backlog etc. I think newer users would get the two mixed up quite easily if we had them both lists. I already see people getting them mixed up now without it being listed. As for on the help contents page that makes sense. - () 17:00, 6 December 2011 (UTC)

The first settler in Windsor was Captain Steele Smith who arrived with his family in August 1764. The Constitution of Vermont was written and signed in 1777 at a tavern, now called Old Constitution House. This constitution declared that Vermont was an independent republic, and no longer part of the British Empire. By 1820, Windsor was the largest town in Vermont. It had factories making guns, machinery, tinware, furniture and harness. A dam built across Mill Brook in 1836 provided water power for these factories.

Psychopathy

Psychopathy is a personality disorder or antisocial personality disorder. Psychopaths are unemotional. They do not care about the emotions or rights of others. They show almost no empathy, and do not try to conform to social norms. They lack a conscience and do not feel guilt. A similar term is sociopathy.
Many psychopaths are charming and often manage to have superficial ties with other people. They use other people for their own benefit. Psychopaths often show other antisocial behaviour as well, including sadism, violence and deception. They are very selfish and discard people whom they have no further use for. They tend to have many children by many partners.
The definition of psychopathy has varied. Different definitions are used. They only partly overlap and sometimes seem contradictory.
There are efforts to use behaviour therapy to treat psychopaths; very often, this is done in prisons. 
Some people are mislabeled as "psychopaths", but have no problems with social norms, but they are good at influencing people.

Map projection

A map projection is a way of showing the surface of a three-dimensional sphere on a flat surface. Such projections are necessary to create maps. The problem with projections is that they change the surface in some way; this is called distorsion. Depending on the purpose of the map, some distorsions may be acceptable. For this reason, there are different map projections that serve different purposes.
Carl Friedrich Gauss showed that is not possible to project the surface of a sphere to a plane, without distorting it. This theorem is known as Theorema egregium today.
To understand the projections, it is easier to imagine a light source, a globe, and another geometric object. The light source shines "a shadow" of each point of the globe onto the geometric object. At the end the surface of the geometric object is unrolled, this yields the map. It is possible to tell the projections apart by the type of helper object used.

Road Town, on Tortola, is the capital of the British Virgin Islands. It is next to the horseshoe-shaped Road Harbour in the centre of the island's south coast. About 9,400 people lived there in 2004.
The name comes from sailing. "The roads" means a place less sheltered than a harbor but where ships stop. Its marina made Road Town a popular place in the Caribbean for chartering yachts. Cruise ships often dock here. Road Town also has tourism.
The Harbour is the dock for many of the ferries servicing the island. The ferry terminal is at the southwest end of Road Town. Ferries run during the day every day of the week. A 28 hectare (70 acre) development called Wickham's Cay, is on two areas of man-made land. The HM Prison on Main Street is the oldest building in Road Town. It was built in the 1840s. People disagree about where the borders of the town are.
The Emancipation Proclamation was read on 1 August 1834. This gave slaves their freedom, even though slavery had been officially abolished in 1807.
In 1853, a fire destroyed nearly every building in Road Town. Angry rioters spread the fire to protest an increase on the cattle tax. Rioters burned most of the plantations across the island.

Couvade

Couvade (French, from "couver", 'to hatch', from Latin "cubare" 'lie down) describes the imitation of a pregnancy. It is performed by a man. The anthropologist E. B. Tylor was the first person that made use of the name "couvade". 
To do so, the father carries out the same restrictions as the mother. These usually start closer towards the end of the pregnancy. It often proceeds for various amounts of time after childbirth. Restrictions: certain food taboos, staying only in the village or at home, avoiding certain places, no consumption of alcohol, cigarettes or stimulants or handling with sharp instruments. In some cases, the man copies the woman’s behaviour and pains during childbirth.
The couvade is known throughout history, for example in the ancient Greece and the Roman Empire, in the Basque Country and in the south of France. These days, it still exists in various cultures around the world among indigenous people in India, Thailand, Indonesia, China, Africa, North America and South America.
These range from the spiritual and physical protection of the child, bonding of father with child as well as wife, the public recognition of fatherhood and support and relief of mother so she can maintain the household after the childbirth. The reasons for couvade are in some cultures linked to certain myths that give instructions and show what can go wrong if the parents do not follow them. 
It is believed to have huge impacts on the child such as illness, disability, death and the transformation into other creatures.

Corydon, Indiana

Corydon is a town in Harrison Township, Harrison County, Indiana, United States. It was founded in 1808. Corydon was the second capital of the Indiana Territory, from May 1, 1813, until December 11, 1816. When Indiana became a US state in 1816, Corydon became Indiana's first state capital. On January 10, 1825 the capital moved to Indianapolis. The town remains the county seat of Harrison County. It had a population of 3,122 at the 2010 census.
Corydon was part of the land captured for the United States by George Rogers Clark from the British during the American Revolution.
In the early 1800s, Edward Smith and his family settled on the site of today's county fairgrounds. William Henry Harrison, Governor of the Indiana Territory, often stopped to rest at their home while travelling to and from Vincennes. Harrison decided to build a town there and asked Edward Smith's daughter, Jenny, to name it. She chose the name "Corydon" from Harrison's favorite hymn, the Pastoral Elegy.
Harrison sold the town site to Harvey Heth in 1808, a government surveyor and large landowner. Heth donated the town square for public use, and sold individual lots to settlers and the government. In 1809, Corydon was joined by road to Doup's Ferry, 15 miles (24 km) to the south in Mauck's Port. This gave access to the Ohio River for trade. Corydon sent a mounted militia company company nicknamed the Yellow Jackets to support the US army in the War of 1812. They fought in the Battle of Tippecanoe.
Corydon, Madison and Jeffersonville all wanted to be the new capital of the territory, but Corydon was more central to the population of the newly reorganized Indiana Territory. Corydon became the second capital of the Indiana Territory on May 1, 1813, when it was moved there from Vincennes. When Indiana became the 19th US state on 11 December 1816, Corydon became the state capital of Indiana. The first state capitol building made using limestone from a nearby quarry, was built from 1814-1816. The Governor's Mansion and First State Office Building were built in 1817. The Grand Masonic Lodge, the first in the state, was built in 1819.
The state's first constitution was written in Corydon during June 1816. The 43 delegates, representing Indiana Territory's counties, met in the Harrison County Courthouse. Because of cramped conditions inside the courthouse and the summer heat, they often met outside under a giant elm tree next to Big Indian Creek. This tree is now known as the Constitution Elm, and its trunk is still preserved. 
Dennis Pennington, the speaker of territorial legislature and others from Harrison County in the Indiana General Assembly did not want to move the capital from Corydon. They added a clause to the state constitution during the convention preventing the capital from leaving the town before 1825. But as the population of the state shifted continually northward, it was no longer convenient to have a state capital at the southern edge of the state. The capital was finally moved to Indianapolis on January 10, 1825.
Corydon was the site of the only Civil War battle fought in Indiana. On July 9, 1863, Confederate cavalry led by Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan, and citizens of Brandenburg, Kentucky, crossed the Ohio River into Indiana. This became known as "Morgan's Raid". Morgan's 2,500 men were opposed by 400 hastily assembled home guard at the Battle of Corydon. The Union troops were quickly defeated and the town surrendered. Corydon was sacked in retaliation for Union looting in Kentucky. The town's treasury of $690 was seized, and prisoners in the jail were released. Morgan demanded from $600 to $700 from each mill and shop owner; otherwise their buildings would be burned. Tradition says one Corydon miller overpaid by $200; Morgan promptly returned it to him.
The railroad reached Corydon in 1882. Corydon was connected by Southern Railways to the main line running across northern Harrison County at Crandall. The line remained open to passenger traffic until 1996. In 2008, the line was owned by Lucas Oil.
In 1929, the county built a new courthouse to replace the old state capitol building. The old statehouse was converted into an historical memorial.
The Old Capitol Building is now a state historic site and the downtown area became a National Historic District in 1973. The Governor's Headquarters, Constitution Elm, First State Office Building and Posey House are also part of the historic area. The O'Bannon Publishing Company prints the "Corydon Democrat"', a weekly newspaper. Indiana Governor Frank O'Bannon owned the publishing company and his wife still lives nearby.
Corydon is located at (38.212724, -86.125318).
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.6 square miles (4.1 km²), all land.

Matsudaira Sadanobu

Sadanobu was born in Edo on January 15, 1759, into the Tayasu branch of the Tokugawa clan. The Tayasu was one of the "gosankyō". The Tayasu were the oldest members of the Shogun's family who still had the name Tokugawa. The other members of the family had the Matsudaira surname.
His father was Tayasu Munetake and he was the grandson of the eighth shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune. The Tayasu house held different beliefs than the others living in Edo Castle. They lived a lifestyle that was more strict. The Tayasu following the example set by Yoshimune. In Munetake's words, the praise of manly spirit ("masuraoburi") as opposed to feminine spirit ("taoyameburi"). This set them apart from the rest of the family. Munetake thought he would rule after his father died. This did not happen. Yoshimune's eldest son, Ieshige became ruler. Because of this, Sadanobu was raised under the belief that he would be the next heir to the title of Shogun. His education growing up was very good. He was taught along Confucian lines. By the time Sadanobu was in his teens, he had already learned much of the teachings of Confucius. As he grew older, many expected more strongly for Sadanobu do well because many members of the Tayasu house began to die young. The family tried many ways to make Sadanobu as the next shogun. Their attempts were stopped by the political clique of Tanuma Okitsugu. Okitsugu was the chief rōjū at that time.
After the last failed try to get Sadanobu adopted by the shogun, Sadanobu was adopted by Matsudaira Sadakuni. Sadakuni was head of one of the Hisamatsu-Matsudaira houses. This was another part of the Tokugawa branch of the family. They ruled the Shirakawa Domain in southern (Mutsu Province. 
Sandanobu took control of Shirakawa in 1783. As soon as he took control he had to deal with a very bad problem. The lands he controlled were said to be worth 110,000 "koku". 1 Koku was the amount of rice needed to feed one person for one year. The land should have been able to create enough rice to feed 110,000 people for a year. But 108,600 Koku was said to be "lost". Sadanobu worked constantly to fix the economic problem in Shirakawa. He work fixed the problems of the finances and economy of the lands. The changes he made, along with his political workings made him very famous. Because of this, he was named chief councilor of the Shogunate in the summer of 1787. He was also made regent to the 11th shogun Tokugawa Ienari early the next year.
Sadanobu was also known as a writer. He wrote using the pen name "Rakuō" (楽翁). Some of his notable texts include "Uge no Hitokoto", "Tōzen Manpitsu", "Kanko-dōri", "Kagetsutei Nikki", "Seigo", and "Ōmu no Kotoba", among others.

Contemporary art

Contemporary art means modern art done after 1945. Another term, which really means the same thing, is postmodern art. Yet another term, which goes wider than art, is Postmodernism.
This problem of labelling comes about because the word 'modern' in art was used for some art from the mid-Victorian period through the whole 20th century. It covers a wide range of styles and movements. So when art critics wanted to describe post-WWII art they had to use a different word. Thus, in art, 'contemporary' (which really means 'at the same time as') comes to mean 'modern', and modern comes to mean 'earlier'.

Dynasties in Chinese history

Many Chinese dynasties have ruled the country during its history. China is a society which has had a very long history. This history was affected by the dynasties which have ruled it. They have slowly changed China into its current form.
The Xia dynasty lasted from 2070 BC until 1600 BC. It was the first ruling dynasty in Chinese history. The Xia was probably created by emperor Yu the Great. It is not known for certain if the Xia dynasty actually existed. Many people thinks that the Xia dynasty is only a legend. This is because there is no evidence that can prove that there was some dynasty before 1600 BC. There were found some archaeological excavations from 1500 BC which may come from the Xia dynasty. For example one of the excavations causes archaeologists to believe that the foundations of China were created during the Xia dynasty. Also there are findings of the oldest Chinese calendar called a lunar calendar. Xia dynasty was ended by a dynasty named Shang.
The Shang dynasty lasted from 1600 BC until 1046 BC. It started when Tang took control from the last Xai emperor, Jie. The dynasty ended with the suicide of Di Xin.
The Shang dynasty was important for Chinese culture. The first Chinese character fonts were created at this time. They were mainly used by seers and shaman. People made their own ritual vessels, agricultural and craft tools and even weapons. Everything was made of cast bronze.
In agriculture, millets, wheats and rice were the main crops. Mulberries were also grown. They were used to feed mulberry silkworms.
The Zhou dynasty lasted from 1045 BC until 256 BC. The Shangs had became weak because they were always fighting with a neighboring tribes. This was good for the less advanced Zhou. They defeat the Shang in the current town of An-yang. After that, the Zhou dynasty took the government. They ruled for the longest time of all Chinese dynasties. 
Zhous were nomadic shepherds from the Shanxi province. The rulers of Zhou dynasty divided the country into four smaller areas. Each of these areas were controlled by relatives and members of aristocracy. Princes controlled fortified towns with a peasant background. They also helped the rulers at times of war. This form of government allowed the Zhou rulers to control more area.

Ethernet hub

An ethernet hub is an electronic device that runs a computer network. It is a simple device and is easy to configure. A hub acts like a repeater: all data that arrives to one port is sent to all other ports (without looking at IP address for the data's destination). That means that all devices in this network will get all data. A hub is very simple device and does not operate Ethernet traffic. In contrast, a switch hub has a lower latency. Many hubs have LED signal lamps to show the state of the hub (which ports are conected and if the hub working). A "collision" happens when two or more devices on the same network try to send packets at the same time. When collisions happen all of the devices have to go through a routine to resolve the conflict. The process is set in the Ethernet Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) protocol
Some hubs may also come with a BNC and/or Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) connector to allow connection to legacy 10BASE2 or 10BASE5 network segments.
There are three kinds of hubs:
Hubs can be used for:
Historically, the main reason for purchasing hubs rather than switches was their price. Today few hubs are produced, because they are not an effective solution for building networks.

The city's primary industries include healthcare, tourism, manufacturing, and professional services. It also has the Park City Center shopping mall. A controversial, citywide video surveillance system includes the most outdoor cameras per capita of any US city.
It was first called Cuteanal Town. Its first leader, John Wright, renamed the city after his home English city of Lancaster. The city's symbol, the red rose, is from the House of Lancaster. Lancaster was part of the 1681 Penn's Woods Charter of William Penn, and was laid out by James Hamilton in 1734. It was incorporated as a borough in 1742 and incorporated as a city in 1818. When the British captured Philadelphia in the American Revolution, Lancaster became the capital of the colonies on September 27, 1777. After the Continental Congress met one day, they moved still farther away, to York, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania government also moved from Philadelphia to Lancaster, but stayed in Lancaster until the British troops left Philadelphia. Lancaster was capital of Pennsylvania again from 1799 to 1812, after which the capital was moved to Harrisburg.
In 1737, the Lancaster County Prison was built in the city, styled after Lancaster Castle in England. The prison remains in use. Public hangings were conducted there until 1912.
The first paved road in the United States was the former Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike (which makes up part of the present-day U.S. Route 30). The Turnpike opened in 1795. The Turnpike connected the cities of Lancaster and Philadelphia, and was designed by a Scottish engineer named John Loudon MacAdam. Lancaster residents are known to use the word, "macadam", instead of "pavement" or "asphalt". This name is a reference to the paving process used by MacAdam.
The city of Lancaster was home to several important figures in American history. Wheatland, the estate of James Buchanan, the fifteenth President of the United States, is one of Lancaster's most popular attractions. Thaddeus Stevens, considered among the most powerful members of the United States House of Representatives, lived in Lancaster as an attorney. Stevens gained notoriety as a Radical Republican and for his abolitionism. The Fulton Opera House in the city was named for Lancaster native Robert Fulton, who had designed the modern steamboat. 
After the American Revolution, the city of Lancaster became an iron-foundry center. Two of the most common products needed by pioneers to settle the Frontier were manufactured in Lancaster: the Conestoga wagon and the Pennsylvania long rifle. The Conestoga wagon was named after the Conestoga River, which runs through the city. 
In 1803, Meriwether Lewis visited Lancaster to be educated in survey methods by the well-known surveyor Andrew Ellicott. During his visit, Lewis learned to plot latitude and longitude as part of his overall training needed to lead the Lewis and Clark Expedition.
In 1879, Franklin Winfield Woolworth opened his first successful "five and dime" store in the city of Lancaster. The F. W. Woolworth Company is succeeded by Foot Locker.
Lancaster was one of the winning communities for the All-America City award in 2000.
Lancaster is located at 40°02'23" North, 76°18'16" West (40.039860, -76.304366), and is above sea level.
The city is located about southeast of Harrisburg, west of Philadelphia, north-northeast of Baltimore and north of Washington, D.C.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and 0.14% is water.
According to Lancaster's 2009 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:
Lancaster has one of the highest rates of green roof space per capita in the US.Lancaster now has of green roofs for a city with a downtown population of 65,000.
Community discussion of rising crime rates sought to avoid a government- or police-operated system of cameras. The Lancaster Community Safety Coalition (LCSC) was registered with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a nonprofit in 2004 to carry out the implementation and operation of a video surveillance system. Paid LCSC staff are background checked by the FBI and trained to monitor the network of 164 closed-circuit TV cameras in the city of Lancaster.
In 2009, the LCSC's expansion from a 70 to a 165 camera network attracted national attention. The national attention led to people asking to end the system. MSNBC commentator Keith Olbermann used the story in his 'Worst Person in the World' segment, "calling out the 'citizen patriots of Lancaster, Pennsylvania' and criticizing them for spying on each other". The surveillance system was also featured on ABC's "Nightline" and "CBS Evening News".
Although public opinion was initially mixed among Lancaster residents, statistical and anecdotal data suggest that the network of cameras is achieving the desired effect. In the fall of 2010, the Lancaster Community Safety Coalition was among several factors credited for a 13.7% drop in Lancaster's violent crime rate according to the FBI's Unified Crime Report (UCR). Property crime dropped 7.1% during the same period. Neighboring cities have not experienced similar reductions in crime. Although in the year 2010, cameras only helped solve 28 of the 6,653 crimes committed in the city in the year 2010. Although the year of 2009 received a reduction in violent crimes of over 13% and recorded 465 violent offenses, the following year of 2010 saw a rise in violent offenses. Violent offenses jumped from 465 in 2009 to 511 in 2010. Lancaster Community Safety Coalition had a success rate of preventing and helping police catch a suspect in .037% of crimes committed and Lancaster has more unsolved homicides since the installation of the cameras.
The Red Rose Transit Authority (RRTA) provides local bus transit to Lancaster City as well as surrounding areas in Lancaster County. RRTA is headquartered outside the City of Lancaster.
Bieber Trailways (formerly Capitol Trailways) provides intercity bus transit from the Lancaster Train and Bus Station to King of Prussia, Philadelphia, and New York City to the east, and York and Harrisburg to the west.
Amtrak also serves the Lancaster Train and Bus Station, located on the northernmost edge of the city at 53 East McGovern Avenue. The "Pennsylvanian", with service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, as well as the "Keystone Service", which runs from Harrisburg to New York via Philadelphia, both serve Lancaster.
The city is served by the Lancaster Airport, located six miles (10 km) north of downtown and just south of Lititz.
Lancaster is also a hub for automobile traffic, with so many major roadways passing through or around the city, including US-30, US-222, PA-283, PA-72, and PA-272.
The city of Lancaster hosts several museums that preserve its important contributions to society. The Demuth Museum is in the former home of a well-known Lancaster painter named Charles Demuth. Additional art museums include the Lancaster Museum of Art and the Philips Museum of Art on the campus of Franklin & Marshall College. Art students at the state-of-the-art Pennsylvania College of Art and Design present their works at the academy's gallery that is open to the public. Another newly constructed museum, completed in 2007, is the Lancaster County Quilts and Textile Museum that celebrates the hand-sewn quilts and other textile items produced by the region's Amish and Mennonite communities. Lancaster also possesses two other museums showing Pennsylvania Dutch heritage with the Lancaster Mennonite Historical Society Museum and the Heritage Center Museum. Children can have a hands-on experience with educational learning at the Hands-on House, also known as Children's Museum of Lancaster. Nature and geology-minded visitors can view the more earthly exhibits of the Louise Arnold Tanger Arboretum and the North Museum of Natural History and Science. Upon completion, the Lancaster County Convention Center will incorporate the Stevens and Smith Historic Site, a museum that will include the preserved home of Thaddeus Stevens and his confidante Lydia Hamilton Smith.
Education in Lancaster is provided by many private and public institutions. The School District of Lancaster runs the city's public schools. The local high school campuses are McCaskey and McCaskey East. Established in 1836, it is the second oldest school district in Pennsylvania. Lancaster Catholic High School was founded in 1926. It currently falls under the jurisdiction of the diocese of Harrisburg. With a P-12 enrollment of more than 500 students, Lancaster Country Day School is one of the region's largest independent nonsectarian schools. Founded in 1908 as the Shippen School for Girls, the school later became coeducational.
Lancaster area hosts several colleges and universities including: Consolidated School of Business, Franklin & Marshall College, Lancaster General College of Nursing & Health Sciences, Lancaster Theological Seminary, Lancaster Bible College, Pennsylvania College of Art and Design, Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology, Millersville University of Pennsylvania, Central Pennsylvania College,and the Harrisburg Area Community College.

Eurasian Union

The Eurasian Union () is a political and economic union whose members are Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and could include other countries from Europe and Asia, such as, for example, countries that were once part of the USSR.
The idea was suggested in October 2011 by the Prime Minister of Russia, Vladimir Putin, but the idea was first proposed by the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, in a speech, in 1994, in Moscow. On 18 November 2011, the presidents of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia signed an agreement in which they agreed to create the Eurasian Union by 2015. The agreement talked about the membership of candidate states and created the Eurasian Commission (which is based on the European Commission) and the Eurasian Economic Space, which both started work on 1 January 2012.

In July, editing restrictions were placed on at the end of this discussion 
Since then, he continued to copy and paste articles into userspace and expected Barras to review them. There have been many discussions about deletion or moving complex chemistry articles fron namespace back into userspace. He has tended to look for ways to skirt any restrictions. Recently, rather than creating new pages as copies from En (restricted), he's been copying section from En into already existing articles. The most recent was Mormonism, which was a 100%, not one char changed, copy. Sometimes they are locations and therefore not too complex, but often they are not. See University of Virginia, Glucose, Nuclear proliferation and Oblate spheroid as just some examples.
Although strictly speaking copying and pasting just a "section" might be considered legalistically different from the above restrictions, I don't think it is in practice. His edits have followed a consistent pattern. He seems not to understand that copying and pasting is a problem. He seems to be encouraging/supporting others (Jonayo) to copy-paste from En as well. RP also shows essentially no interest in simplifying the long backlog of complex copied articles he has created.
I'd like to ask administrators to consider either enforcing the editing restrictions if they are still in place, or putting them back in place if they are not. This editor is disruptive, and just as a reminder, has already been banned on En. I'll leave this to the admins and try to remove myself from any further discussion at this point unless asked a direct question.

I have been going though the contributions for and noticing a lot of subtle vandalism in the form of seemingly correct information. Its mainly been adding certain companies to the distributor listings, movies to the wrong templates (straight to dvd templates getting movies with theatrical releases or tv movies later released to dvd). Two templates created by the user have been tossed up for RfD already. This IP may need to be monitored closely for continuing vandalism as well as all of its contributions rechecked for validity. (working on that last part myself and reverting almost everything as it all seems to be incorrect information.) These actions are very similar to the previous Disney vandal although the IP does not trace to the same geographic location (although a lot of time has passed, thing could have changed for him/her).

I just wanted to bring the page titled "British Israelism" to the admins' attention. The page seems to be glowing with praise for this ideology, despite the fact that it has no basis in science or widespread acceptance. The "Support [for British Israelism]" section is both massive and indiscriminate, with one section simply listing supporting scholars with their affiliations. The corresponding section of detractors, which is merely titled "Reactions," is half the size, and includes several advocates of British Israelism alongside their opponents. The "Research" section is similarly brief, with the sub-section on Genetics at less than 100 words!
At over 18,000 words, this article is a train-wreck. References to actual science are fleeting at best, and the page's content indicates that British Isrealism is a thriving, widespread, even reasonable belief. Please make the changes necessary to correct this. Thank you. 
The articles Modular arithmetic and Module arithmetic have been merged. They have been under proposals to move for over a year with no one arguing the point so I merged the information. All that is left is for the edit histories to be merged. Module arithmetic needs to be moved to Modular arithmetic. Time stamps on the articles should be fine (main article has a later timestamp than redirect article) so this should be a quick merge with no cleanup afterwards. () 09:54, 6 January 2012 (UTC)

I wish to report abusive behaviour by . In the edit here he writes "Kalsermar in Camera-style meat puppetry is now rehashing the Vandalism spree of Mr. Knowalles and his sock puppets (which are now locked globally)" in the edit summary and his latest contribution on the article's talk page (see here) could also be called abusive. I do not take kindly to the opening "OMFG" nor phraseology such as "Camera-style meat puppetry" or being linked to vandalism.
My question on the talk page (""I think it is clear that the onus is on Whaledad to explain why "his" picture (to which there are strong objections) is better than the other picture (which seems up to now to be without controversy"") still goes unanswered in the meantime since Whaledad is merely stating what other projects are doing and not giving much or anything in the way of coherent argumentation. I'm always up for an honest debate about article related content but this is totally out of line and saps me of any will to discuss issues with this user.
It is interesting to note that on nl:Wikipedia, where both of them as well as I, normally operate, this picture was removed after consensus on the talk page concluded it should be. -- () 22:17, 13 January 2012 (UTC)

Electronic gear shifting

In 1861, Pirren Michaux invented the first bicycle with pedals. Since that time, bicycles changed a lot. The first gear-shiftable bicycle was constructed at the beginning of 20th century. You could choose from 2 speeds. It's not big deal nowadays, but then it was huge progress.
Standard system gearing up or down is provided all its way by bowdens. A bowden is special kind of wound-steel cable, which connects levers with the shifter, derailleur or brakes. As we pull or tap a lever, the bowden reacts at the same time. That causes the bicycle to change gear.
Electronic shifting works a little like that, but there are no bowdens. The system is digital. That means no wound-steel cable, but multiple combinations of 0 and 1 provides shifting. A battery placed under the frame powers the whole system. A battery should last for 1000km (depending on the manufacturer), then it needs to be recharged. Wires for data and powering are hidden inside the frame. Parts of the shifting systems are connected together and are powered by the battery. Shifting is done by servomotors. The shifter and derailleur have a pair of servomotors built inside. A microchip in the derailleur gives us freedom. It is self-adjustable. It has its own logic, which keeps the chain from dropping. There is no need of maintenance, because the derailleur adjusts itself, thanks to a microchip.

Languages of Canada

Lots of languages are used in Canada. English and French are used by most Canadians. Only New Brunswick uses both English and French as its official languages. Quebec's official language is French. English and French are recognized by the Constitution of Canada as "official languages." This means that all laws of the federal government are in both English and French and that federal government services can be available in both languages.
Many Canadians believe that the relationship between the English and French languages is important. 
To know how many people speak them, Canada's census collects a lot of kinds of information not collected in most other countries, including home language, mother tongue, first official language and language of work.
People speak other languages. About 18% of Canadians (about 6.1 million people, most are immigrants) have a language other than English or French as their first language or mother tongue. Nearly 3.5 million Canadians continue to use their other language most often, like when at home or in social settings. The biggest ones are Italian, German, Chinese, Punjabi, Arabic and Dutch.
Canada also has many native languages. But they are not spoken by many people (less than one percent of Canada), and fewer people speak them every year.

The Underground Railroad was a secret network of routes and safe houses used by black slaves in the United States to escape to free states and Canada with the help of abolitionists and those who had sympathy to their cause. The term is also applied to the abolitionists, both black and white, free and enslaved, who helped the slaves. Other various routes led to Mexico or overseas. Created in the early 1800s, the Underground Railroad was at its biggest between 1850 and 1860. One statistic suggests that by 1850, 100,000 slaves had escaped by the "Railroad". British North America, where slavery was not allowed, was a popular stopping point, as its long border gave many points of access. More than 30,000 people were said to have escaped there using the network at its best, although U.S. Census statistics shows only 6,000. The Underground Railroad fugitives' stories are recorded in the Underground Railroad Records.

Brick Lane

Brick Lane is a street in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, in the East End of London. It is part of an old area which includes Bethnal Green, Whitechapel, Spitalfields and Petticoat Lane.
Today, it is the heart of the city's British Bangladeshi community and is known to some as "Banglatown". It is famous for its many curry houses. It has a most interesting history.
Brick Lane gets its name from former brick and tile manufacture, using the local brick earth deposits, that began in the 15th century.
Successive waves of immigration began with Huguenot refugees spreading from Spitalfields, where the master weavers were based, in the 17th century. This started a connection with clothing which lasted for over three centuries.
The Huguenots were followed by Irish, Ashkenazi Jews and, in the last century, Bangladeshis. The area became a centre for weaving, tailoring and the clothing industry, due to the abundance of semi- and unskilled immigrant labour.
Brewing came to Brick Lane before 1680, with water drawn from deep wells. One brewer was Joseph Truman, first recorded in 1683. His family went on to establish the sizable Black Eagle Brewery on Brick Lane.
The Brick Lane Market was developed in the 17th century for fruit and vegetables. The Sunday market, like the ones on Petticoat Lane and nearby Columbia Road, dates from a dispensation given to the Jewish community. The Brick Lane Farmers' Market opened 6th June 2010.
Emma Elizabeth Smith was viciously assaulted and robbed in Osborn Street, the part of Brick Lane that meets Whitechapel High Street, in the early hours of 3 April 1888. It was one of the first of the eleven Whitechapel Murders, some of which were done by the serial killer, Jack the Ripper.
In 1742, La Neuve Eglise, a Huguenot chapel, was built on the corner of Brick Lane and Fournier Street. By 1809, it had become The Jews’ Chapel, for promoting Christianity to the expanding Jewish population, and became a Methodist Chapel in 1819 (John Wesley having preached his first covenant sermon at the nearby Black Eagle Street Chapel). In 1898, the building was consecrated as the Machzikei HaDath, or Spitalfields Great Synagogue. In 1976, it became the London Jamme Masjid (Great London), to serve the expanding British Bangladeshi community. The building is Grade II* listed. Many Bangladeshi immigrants to Brick Lane were from the Greater Sylhet region. These settlers helped shape Bangladeshi migration to Britain; families from Jagannathpur and Bishwanath tend to dominate in the Brick Lane area today.

Valve Hammer Editor

Valve Hammer Editor, which used to be called Worldcraft and is now often called Hammer, is Valve Corporation's map creation program for their game engines, Source and formerly GoldSrc. Worldcraft was originally made for Quake and Quake II, but is now used on other games such as "Half-Life 2", "" and "Left 4 Dead 2".
In September 1996, Ben Morris created and released the original Worldcraft as a tool for making custom Quake maps. On July 14, 1997, Valve hired Ben Morris and started to use Worldcraft in "Half-Life".
Hammer uses four windows: three grids and a 3D view. Many tools are available to the user. Work on a map starts by the user creating the main world out of blocks called "brushes". These brushes can be made to look different by selecting images called "textures" to paint onto it. Many other tools can change the look and shape of these brushes to create any shape or figure the user wants.
Smaller parts of a level can be made out of "props", which cannot be made in Hammer and only in a 3D drawing program. Special devices called "entities" can be used to give a level functionality. Entities can be anything from where the player starts (called "info_player_start" in Hammer) to specific guns to non-player characters.
Maps save in the ".vmf" (Valve Map File) format, but cannot be played in-game until it is compiled. Compiled maps take all the entities and lights and transform it into a format that the desired game can read (".bsp").

Sunset Boulevard

Sunset Boulevard is a long road in west Los Angeles. It stretches 24 miles (39 km) from Figueroa Street in downtown (central) Los Angeles to the Pacific Coast Highway in Pacific Palisades at the Pacific Ocean. Part of the Boulevard, called Sunset Strip, passes through Hollywood.
The boulevard is at least four lanes in width for all of the route. Car accidents are not uncommon due to the lack of a central divider on most sections. Also, it has tricky curves and blind crests.
Sunset often has traffic far beyond its design capacity. It is worn, and has cracks and potholes. Traffic on Sunset is often slow-moving, especially during the rush hour. But when traffic is mild, Sunset is a fast thoroughfare because it has few (and short timed) traffic lights in the western part. Even at rush hours, traffic generally flows well, as the lights are well spaced and timed.
This is the 1½ mile (2.4) km strip running through West Hollywood. The Strip is well-known; it has boutiques, restaurants, and nightclubs that are part of the entertainment industry. It is also known for its trademark array of huge, colorful billboards and is a 'hangout' for rock stars, movie stars and other entertainers.
Sunset Strip was the location of a popular TV show "77 Sunset Strip" (1958–1964), starring Ephrem Zimbalist Jnr. Many young stars made an appearance in the series.
Sunset Boulevard gave its name to a famous 1950 movie of the same name, starring Gloria Swanson, William Holden and Eric von Stroheim.

3D television

The function of 3D television is making a two-dimensional screen look like its picture is in three dimensions. This effect starts when we observe two shifted displays.
Basic division of 3d technologies
3D televisions in shops and e-shops are in 90% of cases stereoscopic. Glasses are used to see the picture in three dimensionals. The glasses divide display into two components (either shifted in color or otherwise).
3D TV can do anything as well as 2D TV. The newest types of TV even can convert 2D into 3D but the quality is low.
Movies in 3D format are still scarce. Few people would invest their money into partially exploited machine.
The best 3D television images are on larger television screens.
The closer a person sits to the screen, the stronger the 3D effect. Three-dimensional image processing is also more difficult for the brain.
Because the observation of 3D space in a 3D TV is so hard, viewers should be sitting during the watching 3D TV.

The Black Cauldron

The Black Cauldron is a fantasy novel written by Lloyd Alexander. It was published in 1965 as the second book in The Chronicles of Prydain series. "The Black Cauldron" was awarded a Newbery Medal. "The Black Cauldron" centers around Taran, an Assistant Pig-Keeper who lives in the fantasy land of Prydain.
The book begins with a meeting of many leaders. They make plans to stop the evil Arawn from taking over Prydain. The leaders decide to steal the Black Cauldron, a powerful tool, from Arawn. Prince Gwydion, the war lord of Prydain, leads a band of people into Annuvin, Arawn's country. When there, they learn that the cauldron has already been stolen. The Fair Folk (fairies) tell the group that the witches of Morva stole the cauldron. Prince Ellidyr, a poor youngest son, sneaks away from the group so that he can steal the cauldron for himself. The rest of the group follows to save him from Arawn's soldiers, but are attacked themselves. In the battle, Fflewddur Fflam and Doli are separated from the group. Also, Adaon, son of the chief bard, is wounded very badly. Before he dies, he passes on a brooch to Taran. The brooch has magical powers and Taran uses it to find Fflewddur and Doli. They continue to Morva, where Taran trades the brooch for the cauldron. The group then tries to smash it, but the witches tell them it can only be destroyed when a living person dies in it willingly. On the way back, Ellidyr attacks the group and steals the cauldron. The group is later found by King Morgant and his men, who have captured Ellidyr and beaten him. Morgant plans to use the cauldron to rule Prydain. Morgant ties up the entire group and offers to free them if Taran will join his service. While they are talking, Doli turns invisible and frees the whole group. During the fight that follows, Ellidyr throws himself into the cauldron, destroying it. King Smoit then comes and attacks Morgant, killing him. The group is rescued.

Terra Nova (TV series)

Terra Nova was an American science fiction television series. It was broadcast from September 26 to December 19, 2011 on Fox. Fox has said they will not pick the series up for a second year. The series is shopped to other networks. The series tells the story of the Shannon family as they travel 85 million year into the past. The series starred Jason O'Mara and Stephen Lang.
In the future, Earth is overcrowded. Most plants and animals are extinct. The skies are dark grey and the air is barely breathable because of pollution. The only hope for humanity to survive is in the distant past. Scientists find a way to travel to the past. They decide to send people into prehistoric times. They want to try to rebuild civilization and not repeat the mistakes they have made in their own world. The group in the past calls their new home "Terra Nova". The name means "new land" in Latin. People are sent back in time in groups called "pilgrimages". The story told in the series begins in the year 2149. It continues 85 million years in the past. 
The series is about the Shannon family as they join the Tenth Pilgrimage of settlers to Terra Nova. Jim Shannon is the father of the family. He is a former police officer. Jim’s wife, Elisabeth, is a surgeon. She is the newest member of Terra Nova’s medical team and the new chief medical officer. Jim and Elizabeth have three children; Josh, Maddy and Zoe. Josh () is their 17 year old son. Josh did not want to travel back in time because doing this meant he would have to leave his girlfriend. Upon arriving at Terra Nova, he finds himself instantly drawn to the beautiful and rule-breaking Skye. Maddy is Josh’s 15 years old sister. She hopes Terra Nova will give her a chance to reinvent herself. Zoe is the Shannon's 5 year old daughter. 
When the Shannon family first gets to Terra Nova, they meet Commander Nathaniel Taylor. He is the first person to go to Terra Nova and leader of the settlement. Taylor warns the travelers that while Terra Nova is a place of new opportunities and fresh beginnings, all is not as idyllic as it looks. Along with blue skies, large waterfalls and vegetation, the land is full of danger. This danger is not just from the man-eating dinosaurs. There is also a second group of people lead by Mira, who is opposed to Taylor and his leadership. This group, the Sixers, came to Terra Nova on the Sixth Pilgrimage. Many of the people on that pilgrimage had secret reasons for being there. 
The series was given both good and bad reviews. Before it was being broadcast, most critics liked the series. Near the middle of the season, this opinion changed. Many critics did not like the way the characters acted with each other. By the end of the season, the opinion of the critics had changed again and had become more positive.

Fly fishing

Fly fishing is a method of sport fishing. An artificial fly is cast into the target area with a fly line and fly-fishing rod. This way, the fisherman or woman can catch a lot of fish, both freshwater and marine. Fly fishermen and women use special equipment, such as fly-fishing rod, fly-fishing reel, fly-fishing line, and pitfalls, which are made from natural or synthetic sling materials.
Fly fishing probably began in ancient Egypt, but its modern form goes all the way back to the England of the second half of the 19th century. The local fishermen caught fish with live and later artificial insects. This method began to spread to the rest of Europe. National and international competitions and championships were started. This has brought fly fishing to the attention of the public. 
Lake fly fishing is done on backwaters and mostly on reservoirs, ponds and lakes. The actual hunt is done either from the bank or from the water, by fording or with the help of vessels like ships.
River fly fishing is usually done in flowing waters. It is normally done by fording. The fisherman or woman stands in the water dressed in special waders and wading boots. Fishing from the bank is also possible but it is not done very often. 
Sea fly fishing is done by fording as well as fishing from a boat.
Dry fly fishing is done with a floating line. The bait floats on the water. The fly often looks like hatched insects or other food on the water surface.
Wet fly fishing is done with all types of fly-fishing lines. The fly is underwater and looks like drowned or newly hatched insects. 
Streamer fishing is mostly done with sinking fly lines. The flies look like insects or other organisms.
Nymph fishing is done with all types of fly-fishing lines. The flies look like young insects.
Fly-fishing rod is a kind of fishing rod which is designed only for fly fishing. Its purpose is to give enough power to the fly-fishing line, which carries an artificial fly to the hunting area. 
The fly-fishing line moves an artificial fly to the place of casting. It is only supposed to be used for fly fishing and with the fly-fishing rod and fly-fishing reel. It is not suitable for other ways of fly fishing because it would be damaged.
The fly-fishing reel is used for storing and backing the fly-fishing line. The fly line is stored in a coil. This coil revolves around its vertical axis in the reel. The fly-fishing line is reeled by moving the coil. The coil is secured with a handle.

The Merkava is a main battle tank. It is developed and produced in Israel for the Israel Defense Forces. The tank was first introduced in 1978 and it was first used in combat during the 1982 Lebanon War. Four main versions have been developed. These are called Merkava Mark I – Mark IV.
When designing the Merkava tank, everything was subordinated to the survival aspect of the crew, the engine is placed in front of the tank and thus serve as an additional component of ballistic protection, while the crew can escape from the damaged Merkava door at the rear of the tank. The thick armor and high mobility is one of the best protected tanks in the world. The design team that developed the first version of this tank, led by commander of the Israeli armored corps, Israel Tal.
The Mark I weighed 63 tons. It had 900 horsepower and maximum speed was 46 km/h. It was armed with 105 millimeter M64 main gun, M68 was later installed. Coaxially with the main gun was mounted 7.62 mm machine gun and on the turret were mounted two more 7.62 mm machine guns, and a 60 mm mortar mounted externally.
The Mark II was almost same as the Mark I. The main differences were internal mortar, better mobility and better resistance.
The Mark III weighed 65 tons. It had 1200 horsepowers and maximum speed was 60 km/h. It was armed with 120 millimeter MG251 main gun. Other equipment was almost same as the Mark II. The Mark III was longer and had better armor than the Mark II, and were added some new systems such as fire-control system.
The Mark IV weigh 65 tons. It has 1500 horsepowers and maximum speed is over 60 km/h. The Mark IV is armed with 120 millimeter MG253 main gun using an electrical semi-automatic revolving magazine for 10 rounds. Coaxially with the main gun is mounted machine gun and on the turret is moutnted one more machine gun operated from inside the tank, and internally mounted 60 mm mortar. Mark IV has the new fire-control system enables shoot down helicopters, upgraded tracks, digital battlefield management system, and other.

Mining in Kutná Hora

In the Middle Ages, Kutná Hora belonged to one of the most important cities in the Bohemian Kingdom. The silver mining started in the second half of 13th century. Unfortunately, the exact date and place, where it all started, remains unknown. Because of that there are lots of legends about the discovery of silver. The most common legend tells a story of a monk named Anthony from the monastery in Sedlec. According to this legend 
the monk found out three silver rods at the foot of the hill.
The peak of mining in Kutná Hora was reached in 14th century. During ages there were lots of mines, but only few of them have been preserved. Last mine was closed during 17th century.
Mines were formed by shafts – pits going underground. Their depth varied from 20 to 150 metres. 
Miners worked with simple tools. Only 50 dm3 of rock were extracted within a six-hour shift. This technology allowed them to reach depths ranging from 400 to 450 metres in 14th century. The deepest mine in 16th century was the Osel (donkey) mine, which reached the depth of 600 metres.
Mine was discovered in 1967 during a hydro-geological exploration of the heart of the city. Originally it was thought that the legendary Osel mine had been discovered. But further exploration proved that it is St. George mine.
The mine was established around 1330’s and remained operational until the end of 15th or beginning of 16th century.
Nowadays visitors may see 250 meters long tunnel, but in total there more than 800m of stopes, drifts or corridors. During those 250 meters it’s possible to see several interesting areas. Such as drifts to other levels of mine, exploration drifts, partly flooded stope, fragments of wooden drainage or wooden props (protection against collapsing of ceiling).

Urdă

Urdă (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈurdə]) is a Romanian fresh white cheese made from whey of sheep, goat or cow.
Urdă is produced by heating the whey resulting from the draining of any type of cheese. It is often made into molds to the shape of a half sphere. The paste is finely grained, silky and palatable.
Since urdă is produced by Romanian shepherds since time immemorial in Romania, this product is considered a traditional Romanian dairy product. It is used especially in the preparation of several desserts as clătită and plăcintă.

Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan

The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR; ) was the first successful attempt to establish a democratic and secular republic in the Muslim world (before the Republic of Turkey). The ADR was founded on May 28, 1918 after the collapse of the Russian Empire that began with the Russian Revolution of 1917 by the Azerbaijani National Council in Tiflis, Georgia. Its borders were with Russia in the north, Democratic Republic of Georgia in the north-west, Democratic Republic of Armenia in the west, and Persian Empire (Iran) in the south. It had a population of 2.86 million. Ganja was the temporary capital of the Republic as Baku, which is the de jure capital, was under Bolshevik control.
Under the ADR, a the government was a parliamentary system in which a parliament, called the Milli Majlis (National Assembly of Azerbaijan) elected on the basis of universal, free, and proportional representation, was the highest political institution of state authority and the Council of Ministers was responsible before it. Fatali Khan Khoyski became its first prime minister. Besides the political party Musavat who had the majority in parliament, other political parties were Ehrar, Ittihad, Muslim Social-democrats as well as representatives of Armenian (21 out of 120 seats), Russian, Polish, Jewish and German minorities gained seats in the parliament. Some members supported Pan-Islamist and Pan-Turkist ideologies.
Among the important accomplishments of the parliament was to give women the right to vote, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim nation to give women equal political rights with men. Apart from this accomplishment, Azerbaijan made these reforms earlier than the United Kingdom and the United States. Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of Baku State University, which was the first modern-type university founded in Azerbaijan.
By March 1920, it became clear that Soviet Russia would attack and invade Azerbaijan. The Soviet Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin said that the invasion was justified by the fact that Soviet Russia could not survive without the Baku oil fields, which was at that time the largest oil field in the world with more than half of the world's oil reserves. According to the common opinion in Moscow, Russian Bolsheviks were to "help" the Baku proletariat (workers) in overthrowing the "counter-revolutionary nationalists", meaning the government and the state of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.
After a major political crisis, the Fifth Cabinet of Ministers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic resigned on April 1, 1920. On April 25, 1920, the Soviet Russian 11th Red Army crossed into Azerbaijan, entering Baku on April 27. They demanded the closing of the Azerbaijani parliament and set up their own Bolshevik government headed by Nariman Narimanov. To avoid bloodshed, the members of parliament had to agree with the demand and the ADR officially ended on April 28, 1920, giving way to the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (Azerbaijan SSR) as its successor state. The Red Army met very little resistance in Baku from the Azerbaijani army, which was tied up on the Karabakh front. The first Communist government of Azerbaijan consisted almost entirely of native Azerbaijanis from the left-wing political factions of the "Hummat" and "Adalat" political parties.
In May 1920, there was a major rebellion against the occupying Soviet Russian 11th Red Army in Ganja, who wanted to restore the Musavatists to power. The rebellion was crushed by government troops by May 31. Leaders of the ADR either fled to the Democratic Republic of Georgia, which was the last independent Caucasian country that was invaded in 1921 by Soviet Russia, then to Turkey and Iran, or were captured by Bolsheviks, like Mammed Amin Rasulzade, who was later allowed to emigrate (leave the country), or were executed (killed) like Gen. Selimov, Gen. Sulkevich, Gen. Agalarov, a total of over 20 generals, or assassinated by Armenian terrorists like Fatali Khan Khoyski and Behbudagha Javanshir. Most students and citizens travelling abroad remained in those countries never to return again to their country. Other important ADR military leaders like the former Minister of Defense General Samedbey Mehmandarov and deputy defense minister General Ali-Agha Shikhlinski (who was called "the God of Artillery" ) were at first arrested, but then released two months later thanks to efforts of Nariman Narimanov. Gen. Mehmandarov and Gen. Shikhlinsky spent their last years teaching in the Azerbaijan SSR military school.
In the end, "the Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918-20 quickly or easily. As many as 20,000 died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest." However, the founding of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic was made easier by the fact that there was a certain popular support for Bolshevik ideology in Azerbaijan, among the industrial workers in Baku.

Warchief and his wife were killed and one of humans took little orc baby with him to their base. The human was Aedelas Blackmoore and he named the baby Thrall which means slave to humans.
Blackmoore wasn´t sorry for him, he just wanted to use him as a source of power. His plan was to use Thrall as a Warchief and control through him orcs to serve Blackmoore.
Thrall and some other orcs were prisoned and learned to handle every weapon and how to use battle tactics effectively. They also tought Thrall basics of reading and writing. But he wanted to escape human base and find someone of his kind. One day his only human friend Taretha helped him. She set the base in fire and gave Thrall a chance to escape. Which he managed. After some time he found orc clan led by Grom Hellscream. When he learned some basic informations about orcs from Grom he headed to find his original clan, Frostwolf clan. There he met their shaman Drek´thar and Warchief Doomhammer. Drek´thar learned Thrall ancient ways of shamanism and Doomhammer told him about his parent´s death.
When Thrall managed art of shamanism, he raised together with Doomhammer an army against humans. Orcs won but Doomhammer died. In his last moments he granted Thrall the title of Warchief. Thrall decided to attack human base, home of Aedelas Blackmoore. He wanted to rescue imprisoned orcs there. They attacked and they succeeded in taking base. But only Blackmoore remained alive. Thrall went to his house, and when he entered he saw Blackmoore standing over dead body of Taretha. Angry Thrall killed blackmoore without any mercy.

<doc id="316622" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316622" title="Thunderstorm">
Thunderstorm

Thunderstorms are small, intense weather systems that make strong winds, heavy rain, lightning, and thunder. Thunderstorms can happen anywhere with two conditions: the air near the Earth's surface must be warm and moist (with lots of liquid), and the atmosphere must be unstable. 100 lightning bolts hit the earth every second, and at any one moment, about 1,800 thunderstorms happen around the earth.
Thunderstorms are rare in cold weather. When they happen, it is called thundersnow.
Usually there are more clouds in the afternoon than in early morning. This is because the ground has warmed up enough by the afternoon for strong winds to blow upward from the ground (these winds are called "updrafts"). If there is very little moisture, an updraft has to go much higher before the water vapor condenses into a cloud. Sometimes the air can rise up as high as 5,000 to 10,000 feet (1,524 to 3,048 m) before a small cumulus cloud can condense from the invisible water vapor.
High, puffy little clouds do not change until a lot of moisture is added. This moisture helps the updraft. Moisture can add heat, which means the cloud will warm up inside and go up even faster. The moisture makes the cumulus cloud "mushroom" upwards and turn into a tall cumulus cloud. The winds inside this cloud are very strong. Thunder and lightning begins when the top of the cloud is 25,000 feet (7,280 m) high. The inside of the cloud is, by this time, cold enough so that the water drops are turned into ice crystals. A cumulus cloud stops growing when it hits the warm stratosphere. Some thunderstorms grow twice as high as Mount Everest!
Strong upper winds in the stratosphere smooth and spread the top of the cloud. This make the cloud look like the top of a mushroom or an anvil. The ice crystals in the anvil cloud give it a fuzzy look. As a thunderstorm grows, water drops or ice crystals inside the cloud hit and mix with each other, getting bigger. The bottom of the cloud grows dark with water about to fall. When the drops become so heavy that the winds inside the cloud cannot keep them up any more, they fall from the cloud as rain or hail. Even as they fall the water drops grow by mixing with the smaller drops, and makes big raindrops. Hail becomes bigger inside the cloud. One thunderstorm cloud usually runs out of energy in about 30 to 50 minutes. But supercell thunderstorms can last for hours until they dissipate by outflow.
Thunderstorms are very active electricity. Lightning is a large electrical discharge that happens between two opposite charged surfaces.
When lightning strikes, energy is let out. This energy moves to the air and makes air spread quickly and send out sound waves. Thunder is the sound that comes from the rapid spread of air along the lightning strike. Thunder is slower than lightning, because light is faster than sound.
Only about 10% of thunderstorms are thought severe. Severe thunderstorms cause high winds of more than , hail, flash floods, and tornadoes. Hailstorms damage crops, damage the metal on cars, and break windows. Sudden flash floods that happen because of heavy rains is the biggest reason for weather-related deaths.
Lightning, which happens with all thunderstorms, makes thousands of forest fires each year in the United States. Lightning also kills or injures hundreds of people a year in the United States.
Regular thunderstorms begin when warm air near the ground mix with moist air, which makes an updraft (a wind that goes upward). A severe thunderstorm needs a strong "up"draft and a strong "down"draft. A strong updraft is made when, firstly, the ground is very hot; secondly, when the air is very moist; and thirdly, the air above is very cold. When the updraft gets stronger, so does the thunderstorm.
Flash floods happen when slow-moving thunderstorms pour down much more water than usual in a small area. It rains so hard that the water can not soak into the ground fast enough, and the water rushes down the mountainsides or hills into streams and rivers. These streams and rivers cannot carry all the water, so it quickly floods. The most severe flash flood makes the water level rise dangerously in streams, dry places, or canyons. Flash floods can make terrible mud slides and can move very quickly. They can roll big rocks, tear out trees, and destroy buildings and bridges.
Flash floods can also happen when two or more thunderstorms hit the same spot, one right after the other. They can happen when a dam bursts open or ice breaks up. Flash floods can also happen when it rains very hard on quickly melting snow.
Thunderstorms do not do only damage, however: they can be a great help to man and all living creatures. We get lots of water for many continents during the summer. Plants receive lots of life-giving rain when they need it. Without the thunderstorms, many continents would become dry. Fish would die, crops would fail, and animals would die.
Thunderstorms are also our natural air conditioners. Hot air at the surface rises up into the high atmosphere where it is put out into space. Clouds give us shades, and rain can cool down a hot day. Without thunderstorms, the earth would be as much as warmer. In the summer, dust, haze, and other pollutants come together in the lower atmosphere. When the air rises, either in cumulus clouds or in thunderstorms, spreads the pollution higher up into the atmosphere. Rain from thunderstorms washes away many of these pollutants out of the air.
Lightning in thunderstorms also helps keep the electrical balance between the earth and the atmosphere. Lightning is also fertilizer. When it splits through the sky, it changes nitrogen gas in the air to nitrogen compounds. These fall to the ground and are added to the soil. Nitrogen is one of the main ingredients in fertilizer. Ten percent of the nitrogen fertilizer needed for farming is made by lightning.
So, even though thunderstorms are dangerous, they can be a great help. They give summer water, cool the earth, and clean the air. Lightning balances the earth's electricity and helps fertilize the soil. And after a thunderstorm, sometimes there is a rainbow.
Some tips to keep safe in a thunderstorm are:

2012 Atlantic hurricane season

The 2012 Atlantic hurricane season was an event that occurs when tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic basin. The season began when Tropical Storm Alberto formed on May 19, 2012. Four days later, Tropical Storm Beryl developed. It became a subtropical storm and on May 27, was upgraded to a tropical storm. This is the first time since the 1908 Atlantic hurricane season that two storms formed before the official start date. The 2012 Atlantic hurricane season began on June 1 and ended on November 30, 2012. There were no storms formed in the month of July.
Tropical Storm Alberto formed on May 19, 2012. It became an "early season storm" because it formed before the official start of the season. Tropical Storm Alberto dissipated on May 22 without making landfall. Its maximun sustatined winds were at 60 miles per hour.
Tropical Storm Beryl developed. It became a subtropical storm and on May 27, was upgraded to a tropical storm. It hit Jacksonville, Florida.
Hurricane Chris was the third tropical system. It formed on June 19. It was also the first hurricane of the season, unexpectedly becoming one. It was in an unfavorable environment, with cool sea waters and moderate vertical wind shear. Chris, after weakening from a hurricane, became a non-tropical cyclone southeast of Newfoundland on June 22.
The following names were used for named storms in the North Atlantic in 2012. The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2018 season. This is the same list used in the 2006 season. The names Kirk, Oscar, Patty, Rafael, Sandy, and Tony were used for Atlantic storms for the first time in 2012. Kirk replaced Keith after 2000, but was not used in 2006. 
On April 11, 2013 the name "Sandy" was retired due to the damage and deaths it caused. Sandy was replaced with "Sara" for the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season.

Hlinsko

Hlinsko is a small city in east Bohemia in the Czech Republic. It stands on the banks of the Chrudimka river, in the Bohemian-Moravian highlands on the border of the Iron Mountains. Hlinsko belongs to the Pardubice region. It has about 10 000 inhabitants. Hlinsko is about 590 meters away over the sea.
In the 11th century, there was created a potter’s camp on the route from Bohemia to Moravia. From there is taken name of the city, which comes from the word “hlína” (clay, material used by potters). First historical remark about Hlinsko comes from first half of 14th century.
From this time, Hlinsko belongs to domination of Rychmburk, which belongs to Tas from Rychmburk, later to Vartenberk and next to Arnošt Flaška from Pardubice. In this century, city obtained reeve’s department.
There was an old merchant’s route passing through Hlinsko, which was drawed in the Klaudián’s map from year 1518. In 1718, clan Kinských bought Rychmburk’s domination.
In 1834, Hlinsko became independent on authorities. In 1850, there was created district in Hlinsko. In 1871 was finished construction of the railroad and began traffic on the road from Pardubice to Havlíčkův Brod (passing through Hlinsko).
There are many well-preserved people’s buildings in Hlinsko and its neighborhood already from half of 18th century. In part of Hlinsko it is Betlém, in neighborhood it is outdoor museum of people’s architecture in Veselý Kopec, Dřevíkov, Svobodné Hamry and Možděnice. There is camp Ležáky about 10 kilometers from Hlinsko, which was burned by Nazis during World War Two.
In modern history, Hlinsko was district city in years 1949 – 1960, after 1960 city lost benefit of district and it was integrated to Chrudimský district against will of its exponents. City became administrative centre once again in 1.1.2003 after reform of public administration, when Hlinsko became city of third level (city with extended scope).
Set of people’s buildings is on right bank of Chrudimka river. Before it was part of the city formed by timbered cottages, in which potters and tailors lived. Building material was mainly wood, wall was only in part around heater.
In 1995, Betlém was declared as monumental reservation of people’s architecture.
Many of buildings was renewed. Visitors can look over here how people lived and what traditions they had. There take place periodical exhibitions, too.
There are expositions from history of Hlinsko district in museum. Visitors can find here a memorial hall of Adámků’s family, learn about history of education, crafting… They can see examples of contemporary suits and fashion accessories. There is permanent exposition of reliefs from Karel Lidický, and an exhibition of images. Name of this exhibition is “Výtvarné Hlinecko” and some of exhibited images are borrowed from National gallery.
For cultural self-realization is there cinema and theater.
For book lovers is there Hlinsko’s library, which has two sections: child’s and adult’s.
City’s cultural club Hlinečan offers a wide spectrum of theater shows, concerts, lectures and social actions for inhabitants of Hlinsko and its region. They are organized in Chamber theatre or in local Sokol house.
Every year there are organized Adámek’s folklore celebrations. There are concerned groups not only from Czech republic, but also from abroad. Groups Vysočan and Vysočánek are representing Hlinsko.
Hlinsko produce Hlinsko’s news, which appears every month.
City has also its own TV – Cable’s information service.
The biggest companies in Hlinsko:
Children from Hlinsko can attend three nursery schools. Next they can study at one of three primary schools (Ležáků, Smetanova, Resslova). There is also a special school for children with defects in writing, reading or counting.
There is also one secondary grammar school, Karel Václav Rais’s in Hlinsko. It offers four-year and eight-year study.
Parents can sign on their children to art school. It offers education in most artistic disciplines.
In city stadium with grassy playground there is possible to practice summer sports. It is possible to use covered swimming pool with sauna.
In winter, friends of ice-skating and ice-hockey can use winter stadium or ski lifts, running tracks and hills for sledging.

Sacagawea

Sacagawea (c. 1788 – probably December 20, 1812; was a Lemhi Shoshone woman, who went along with the Lewis and Clark Expedition as an interpreter and guide. Lewis and Clark explored the Western United States with her, travelling thousands of miles from North Dakota to the Pacific Ocean between 1804 and 1806. 
Sacagawea is well remembered today. When many people think about Lewis and Clark today, they also think about Sacagawea.
In 2000, the United States Mint issued the Sacagawea dollar coin in her honor, showing Sacagawea and her son, Jean Baptiste Charbonneau. The face on the coin was made to look like a modern Shoshone-Bannock woman named Randy'L He-dow Teton. This was because nobody knows exactly what Sacagawea looked like.
In 2001, she was given the title of Honorary Sergeant, Regular Army, by President Bill Clinton.
Not much is known for sure about Sacagawea.
At about thirteen years of age, Sacagawea was taken as a wife by Toussaint Charbonneau, a Quebecer trapper living in the village. He had also taken another young Shoshone named Otter Woman as a wife. 
Sacagawea was pregnant with her first child when the Corps of Discovery arrived near the Hidatsa villages to spend the winter of 1804–1805. Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark built Fort Mandan. They interviewed several trappers who might be able to interpret or guide the expedition up the Missouri River in the springtime. They agreed to hire Charbonneau as an interpreter when they discovered his wife spoke Shoshone, as they knew they would need the help of Shoshone tribes at the headwaters of the Missouri. 
Lewis wrote in his journal on November 4, 1804: 
Charbonneau and Sacagawea moved into the expedition's fort a week later. Clark nicknamed her Janey. Lewis wrote about the birth of Jean Baptiste Charbonneau on February 11, 1805.
In April, the expedition left Fort Mandan and headed up the Missouri River in "pirogues". They had to be poled against the current and sometimes pulled from the riverbanks. On May 14, 1805, Sacagawea rescued items that had fallen out of a capsized boat, including the journals and records of Lewis and Clark. The corps commanders, who praised her quick action, named the Sacagawea River in her honor on May 20.
By August 1805, the corps had found a Shoshone tribe and was trying to trade for horses to cross the Rocky Mountains. They used Sacagawea to interpret and discovered that the tribe's chief was her brother Cameahwait.
Lewis recorded their reunion in his journal:
And Clark in his:
The Shoshone agreed to trade horses to the group, and to provide guides to lead them over the cold and barren Rocky Mountains. The trip was so hard that they were had to eat candles just to live. When they went down into the more temperate regions on the other side, Sacagawea helped to find and cook camas roots to help them get their strength back.
As the expedition approached the mouth of the Columbia River on the Pacific Coast, Sacagawea gave up her beaded belt to let the captains trade for a fur robe they wanted to give to President Thomas Jefferson. 
On the trip back, they came near the Rocky Mountains in July 1806. On July 6, Clark wrote "The Indian woman informed me that she had been in this plain frequently and knew it well... She said we would discover a gap in the mountains in our direction..." which is now Gibbons Pass. A week later, on July 13, Sacagawea told Clark to cross into the Yellowstone River basin at what is now known as Bozeman Pass. This was later chosen as the best route for the Northern Pacific Railway to cross the continental divide.
While Sacagawea has been thought of as a guide for the expedition, she probably only gave directions a few times. Her work as an interpreter certainly helped the party to talk with the Shoshone. However, the most important thing she did for the group may have been being there during the hard journey, which showed they did not want to attack any Native Americans they came across. While traveling through what is now Franklin County, Washington, Clark noted, "The Indian woman confirmed those people of our friendly intentions, as no woman ever accompanies a war party of Indians in this quarter," and, "the wife of Shabono our interpreter we find reconsiles all the Indians, as to our friendly intentions a woman with a party of men is a token of peace."
After the expedition, Charbonneau and Sacagawea spent three years among the Hidatsa before accepting William Clark's invitation to live in St. Louis, Missouri in 1809. 
Sacagawea gave birth to a daughter, Lizette, sometime after 1810. According to Bonnie "Spirit Wind-Walker" Butterfield, historical documents say that Sacagawea died in 1812 of an unknown sickness: 
As further proof that Sacagawea died in 1812, Butterfield writes:
"An adoption document made in the Orphans Court Records in St. Louis, Missouri states, 'On August 11, 1813, William Clark became the guardian of 'Tousant Charbonneau, a boy about ten years, and Lizette Charbonneau, a girl about one year old.' For a Missouri State Court at the time, to designate a child as orphaned and to allow an adoption, both parents had to be confirmed dead in court papers."

Australasia at the Olympics

Australasia at the Olympics is a history which includes 2 games in 2 countries and 53 athletes. Since 1908, Australasia (ANZ) has contributed to the growth of the "Olympic Movement".
Australasia's team first competed at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. 
Australasia was the name of a combined team of athletes from Australia and New Zealand. They competed together at the 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics. When the Olympic Games started up again in 1920 after World War I, the two countries sent separate teams to the Games.
The Australasia team won a total of twelve medals in the two games in which they competed. Most of these were in swimming. One New Zealander won a medal in 1908. Harry Kerr won a bronze in athletics. In 1912, two New Zealanders won medals. Malcolm Champion won a gold in swimming. Tony Wilding won a bronze in tennis. All other medalists for Australasia were Australians.

Jawa Motors

Jawa started in 1927. Czechoslovak ammunition factory of František Janeček started find a new product program, because army production was stopped. František Janeček was a scientist, inventor and constructor. In Czechoslovakia was production of motorbikes only small-lot or single part, so new production program was chosen in this branch.
The name JAWA comes from the first two letters of words Janeček, name of the holder and Wanderer, name of the Austrian factory, which sold licence for first JAWA motorbike Wanderer 500 OHV.
In 1932 František Janeček presented a new motorbike, it was Jawa 175 Villiers. Licence was bought from England, from constructor G.W. Patchettem. It was simple motorbike for today using. In Czechoslovakia was very favourite for light weight. To 1935 were produced some 3000 motorbikes of this type. 
In 1935 the same frame used engine JAWA 350 OHV. This motorbike was stronger and more luxury than previous type 175 Villiers. There was more chrome parts and a built-in speedometer. 4000 motorbikes of this type were produced.
Most small and youngest motorbike of season before World War II was the Jawa 100 Robot. It was a small moped . About 12000 were produced.
In 1933 Jawa started to produce small cars. Ing. Janeček bought a licence from German Meisterklasse DKW. It was called JAWA 700. To 1934 was produced some one thousand cars of this type, because sale was full of small cars, so JAWA produced more motorbikes than cars, in season before war were motorbikes more favourite.
The start of World War II meant the end of motorbike production. Lots of motorbikes projects was created illegally, but only one realized, Jawa 350 „Pérák“ After war was produce of motorbikes started again. „Pérák“ was first motorbike with Czech licence, all parts of this motorbike were from Czechoslovakia. It was technical a technology miracle of this season. 
In 1952 was produced one of travelling motorbike Jawa 500 OHC, there was used four stroke engine. This motorbike is used by the police and the army. 
To the 1960 JAWA cooperated with many countries, for example India, Turkey, Egypt. Firm IDEAL MOTORD in Majsur in India bought licences from Jawa mostly. 
In 1970 were most produced motorbikes „BIZON“ series, and after that was created JAWA 634, which were modernized to model 640. JAWA produced a lot´s of models of mopeds, for example JAWA 50 types 20,21 named „pionýr“ or „pařez“ This motorbikes were mostly sell in SSSR. 
Jawa 638-640 has engine 350ccm, it is robust and favourite motorbike in class motorbike.
Today JAWA is sold in many European countries. The newest models are JAWA 660, JAWA 125 and 50 Dandy, JAWA 250, 350 and. Basic of motorbikes is really the same like 70 years ago, but it is very modernized, mainly motors. Today stronger four-stroke motors are used, two-stroke motors are used to 350ccm.

Cathedral of the Holy Spirit (Czech Republic)

The Cathedral of St. Ducha ("the holy spirit") is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Hradec Králové, Czech Republic. It was built in 1307. It was built by order of Eliška Rejčka because the church of St. Klement was too small. The church was burned and rebuilt several times between the 14th and 16th centuries. In the 17th century, the church was plundered by Swedish soldiers. In 1664, Pope Alexander VII blessed the church as a cathedral. The last repairs were done after World War II.
The cathedral has an old Gothic altar from the end of the 15th century. It also has an early baroque altar from the 17th century. There is a portrait of St. Antoním by Petr Brandla, a pastoforium made by Matej Rejsem and a pulpit by Josef Myslbek. Under the cathedral are 3 crypts. There is a legend about one of them. In the legend, Jan Žižka z Trocnova, a famous Hussite commander, was buried there for a short time. In the towers are 4 bells named Leopold, Klement, Václav and Michal.
There are services every day. On Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, services are at 18:30. On Sunday, services are at 6:30, 9:30 and 11:00. There is a special service for children on Wednesdays at 17:30. People can visit the interior of the cathedral during worship.

Computer network

It is possible to connect a number of computers and other electronic devices to create a computer network. The computers and devices which are part of the network can "talk" to each other and exchange information. In addition to the computers and devices which are connected, other devices are often needed for the network to work correctly. Examples for such devices include hubs and switches. Different kinds of network can be connected to each other with a router. Firewalls are commonly used to protect the network. In general, networks that use cables to connect can operate at higher speeds than those using wireless technology.
A Local Area Network (LAN) connects computers which are close together. Building a LAN is easier than connecting different networks (by a Wide Area Network). The largest Wide Area Network is the Internet.
Computers can be part of several different networks. Networks can also be parts of bigger networks. The "local area network" in a small business is usually connected to the "corporate network" of the larger company. These connections may allow access to the "Internet". For example, a shop may use it to show merchandise on its Web site through a web server, or to convert received orders into shipping instructions.
A network must be connected with appropriate hardware. This can be wired or wireless. For a simple LAN, computers, media and peripherals are sufficient. WANs (wide area networks) and some large LANs (local area networks) need some additional devices like a bridge, gateway or router to connect different small or large networks.
A network needs a communication protocol. Microsoft Windows, Linux and most other operating systems use TCP/IP. Apple Macintosh computers used Appletalk in the 20th century, but use TCP/IP now.
The network communication technology as one complete technology would be very difficult to implement. To simplify it, we must add many network models such as ISO/OSI.
All network models are made with same ideas. The top layer uses services of the lower one and has services for the upper one. Each layer can only communicate with the same layer on the destination device.
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is a 7-layer network model specified by ISO (International Organization for Standardization) norm and is widely used all around the world. The concept of a seven-layer model was provided by the work of Charles Bachman, Honeywell information Services. Various aspects of OSI design evolved from experiences with the ARPANET, NPLNET, EIN and CYCLADES networks and the work in IFIP WG6.1.
The physical layer defines electrical and physical specifications for devices. It also specifies modulated and baseband transmission.
Baseband is digital data in their raw form (1001 1101 1010 0011). This allows very fast and reliable transmission over short distances; however, the media tend to make the bits interfere with each other, the range of baseband transmission is very limited. It becomes worse with increasing speed. Baseband technology is frequently used on LAN.
Typical technology: Ethernet
In telecommunications, modulation is the process of conveying a message signal, for example a digital bit stream or an analog audio signal, inside another signal that can be physically transmitted. The device that provides modulation of the baseband signal is called a modulator, and the device that provides demodulation of the modulated signal back to baseband is called a demodulator. Today, the modulator and demodulator are integrated into one device called Modem (modulator-demodulator). Frequently used on WAN, WLAN, WWAN.
Typical technology: WI-FI, ADSL, cable TV connection (CATV)
The data link layer provides the functional and procedural means to transfer data between network entities and to detect and possibly correct errors that may occur in the physical layer.
The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences from a source host on one network to a destination host on a different network using the IP address.
An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. At present there are two versions of protocols in use – IPv4 and IPv6.
The transport layer provides transparent transfer of data between end users, providing reliable data transfer services to the upper layers. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) of the Internet Protocol Suite are commonly categorized as layer-4 protocols within OSI.
Commonly united into one layer in simplified network models, its main purpose is to interact with applications, encrypting and establishing dedicated connections if necessary.
Latency, incorrectly called ping, is a value that measures how much time packets need to travel to their destination. It is measured in miliseconds (ms). The tool that measures latency is called ping, commonly using special ICMP packets which are smaller than standard data packets so they do not weight the network by their presence.
Capacity is a measure of transfer capacity of a network and is measured in bits per second (bps or b/s), today commonly Mbps or Mb/s. It shows us how many data units are transferred each second. At present, the average bandwidth is far higher than is necessary and it is not a limiting factor in most cases.
Broadcast is a special transmission that is not addressed to a single device but to all devices in specific network. It is mostly used to automatically issue IP addresses to devices by a DHCP server and to create an ARP table that maps the network and speeds up the traffic.

Sequoia

Sequoia is a genus of redwood trees in the Cupressaceae family. It includes the largest trees in the world. The only living species of the genus is the Sequoia sempervirens, which is found in northern California and southern Oregon in the United States. Several other species have been named from fossils, but are now extinct. These include "Sequoia affinis", "Sequoia chinensis" in China, "Sequoia langsdorfii", "Sequoia dakotensis" of South Dakota, and "Sequoia magnifica".
The oldest known fossils in the "Sequoia" genus are those of "Sequoia jeholensis", which have been found in Jurassic deposits of southern Manchuria. By the late Cretaceous it had spread to other parts of China, Europe, and western North America.
These trees grow only in 75 groups across 35,600 acres in California, near the Sierra Nevada mountains. These groups were formed as a protection from logging. The most famous area with sequoia trees is Sequoia National Park. The park was made as the second national park, after the Yellowstone in 1980. The Sequoia National Park is managed with Kings Canyon National Park. Together, the two parks are called Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Several trees in Sequoia National Park have even been named, for example General Grant, the Grizzly Giant or General Sherman.

New Bern, North Carolina

New Bern () is a city in Craven County, North Carolina with a population of 29,524. It is located where the Trent and the Neuse rivers meet. The city is 112 miles (180 km) east of Raleigh and 87 miles (140 km) northeast of Wilmington. New Bern is the county seat of Craven County. New Bern is the birthplace of the international drink, Pepsi Cola.
New Bern was an Indian town named Chattoka. Swiss immigrants moved to New Bern in 1710. It was named after the capital of Switzerland: Bern. "Bern" is bear in the German language, and the flags of both towns have the drawing of a bear.
New Bern is the second oldest town in North Carolina. It served as the capital of the North Carolina colonial government and then briefly as the state capital until 1792. After the American Revolution, New Bern became rich and quickly developed a rich cultural life. At one time New Bern was called "the Athens of the South." After Raleigh was named as the state capital, New Bern rebuilt its economy with the help of trade routes to the Caribbean and New England. It reached a population of 3,600 in 1815. During the 19th-century Federal period, New Bern was the largest city in North Carolina.
New Bern has four historic districts with homes, stores and churches dating back to the early eighteenth century. Close to the waterfront are more than 164 homes and buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Also nearby are several bed and breakfast inns, hotels, restaurants, banks, antiques stores and specialty shops. Tryon Palace, the home of British governor William Tryon, was built in 1770. It was used as the original state capitol building of newly independent North Carolina. It burned down in the 1790s. People can now visit a replica, built from the original plans and on the original foundation. The Masonic Temple and the Athens Theater are both still very active today. The Masonic Theater is the oldest theater in America in continuous use.
The historic districts also are home to many of the town's 2,000 crape myrtles — New Bern’s official flower — and gardens. The district has flowering dogwoods and azaleas.
Union Point park is where the Neuse and Trent Rivers join. It is the city’s major celebration spot for events such as Neuse River Days and the Fourth of July. In 1979, the local government gave Swiss Bear Downtown Revitalization Corp — a nonprofit corporation of civic leaders — control of the failing downtown area. Today, art galleries, specialty shops, antiques stores, restaurants and inns have changed downtown and the waterfront into a social hub. Improvements are still being made. Built in 1995 through the efforts of Swiss Bear, James Reed Lane is a downtown mini-park and pedestrian walk-through on Pollock Street across from historic Christ Church. Private restoration efforts have returned many of the downtown buildings to their turn-of-the-last-century elegance.

Ecological footprint

An ecological footprint measures how much people take from nature. The footprint is then compared to what natural resources there are to provide for people. The ecological footprint takes into account how much farm land, forest area, grazing land and sea area it takes to provide everything people use. More simply, footprint calculations answer the questions: how much nature do we have? And how much do we use?
When analysing the world as a whole, humanity is using nature about 1.5 times faster than nature renews itself. It is like using 1.5 planet Earths. Since people consume differently around the world, it is also possible to calculate how many planet it would take if everybody around the world consumed like a particular population. For instance, if everybody consumed like the Germans, it would take nearly 3 planet Earths. Another estimate says "the average world citizen has an eco-footprint of about 2.7 global average hectares while there are only 2.1 global hectare of bioproductive land and water per capita on earth. This means that humanity has already overshot global biocapacity by 30% and now lives unsustainabily by depleting stocks of "natural capital".

Environmental impact of aviation

Air travel has a major impact on the world's environment, especially the atmosphere. With fast globalisation, air traffic has quickly increased, and is one of the biggest causes of climate change. 
This is due to the noise pollution emitted from the aircraft while it is flying. It also takes fuel to fly the planes which causes pollution. Aircraft pollution has increased a great deal although flying or taking a transportation method that can carry more than a few individuals at a time is more environmentally friendly than a smaller vehicle.
Public awareness of the impact of aircraft on the environment is a lot less compared with motor vehicles (such as cars).

Water footprint

A water footprint is the amount of freshwater used by individuals, groups or companies in order to make goods or provide services used by the community. These goods and services may be needed around the entire world. A water footprint can be determined by math for any well-established group of users, or producers. It is measured by dividing the total amount of water used, by the water that became polluted, in the same area during the same amount of time. While the water footprint of an organization is a good indicator for its water consumption and pollution, it does not show how other water sources are affected. More studies will need to be done in order to determine the effect of the water footprint on water sources.
Etymology
The water footprint concept was introduced in 2002 by A.Y. Hoekstra from UNESCO-IHE as an alternative indicator of water use.[2]. The concept was refined and accounting methods were established with a series of publications from two lead authors A.K. Chapagain and A.Y. Hoekstra from the UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, now at WWF-UK and University of Twente respectively. The most elaborate publications on how to estimate water footprints are a 2004-report on the 'Water footprint of nations' from UNESCO-IHE [3] and the 2008-book Globalization of Water by A.Y. Hoekstra and A.K. Chapagain, published by Blackwell, 2008. Cooperation between global leading institutions in the field has led to the establishment of the Water Footprint Network in 2008 that aims to coordinate efforts to further develop and disseminate knowledge on water footprint concepts, methods and tools.

Bang! is a card game. It is set in the Wild West. It was made by an Italian man named Emiliano Sciarra. This year, there were many expansion packs for the game. With all of them, this game can be played with eight players at the most.
At the beginning of game, every player chooses their character and role. When the player is choosing their character, they take two random cards, looks at special ability and picks one of them. Every character has a different count of lives (from three to five). The sheriff has one more.
There are four roles. Every player knows only their own role. Only the sheriff is known to everybody. Roles are different depending on the number of players:
Each player has a different mission:
After everyone chooses their character and role, the game starts. Every player gets the same amount of cards as the amount of lives they have, so if a player has three lives, they get three cards. At the beginning of turn, the player takes two cards. There are three kinds of cards. They have brown, blue and green edges. Brown cards allow players to play immediately, blue cards mean a player has to put it on the table first.

Aspen

Aspens are a type of poplar tree with leaves that move with the slightest wind. The two main species are both called 'trembling aspens' or 'quaking aspens' on account of their leaves.
Populus tremuloides is the American aspen. It is common in temperate and colder regions of North America. 
It forms large stands (groups) of genetically identical trees (clones) connected by a single underground root system. These trees form through root sprouts coming off an original parent tree. The largest known fully connected aspen is a grove in Utah nicknamed 'Pando', and some experts call it the largest organism in the world, by mass or volume. It covers 0.43 km (106 acres) and is estimated to weigh .
Populus tremula is a species of poplar native to cool temperate regions of Europe and Asia, from the British Isles east to Kamchatka, north to inside the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia and northern Russia, and south to central Spain, Turkey, the Tian Shan mountain system, North Korea, and northern Japan. It also occurs at one site in northwest Africa in Algeria. In the south of its range, it occurs at high altitudes in mountains.
It is a hardy species which tolerates long, cold winters and short summers. Aspen is dioecious, so individual trees are either male or female (in contrast to most trees, where male and female flowers occur on the same tree). Trees flower in March and April, before the leaves appear, with both the male and female trees producing catkins. Pollinated female catkins ripen in early summer and release tiny seeds which are tufted with hairs. 
Like other aspens, its main method of reproduction is vegetative (asexual). It spreads extensively by root sprouts, which may be produced up to 40 metres from the parent tree. They form extensive clonal colonies. Large numbers of new shoots can be produced in this way, especially after a major disturbance such as fire.

Škoda Auto

Škoda Auto (), better known as Škoda, is an automobile maker. It is based in the Czech Republic. Škoda was bought by the Volkswagen Group in 2000. Its total sales reached 684,226 cars in 2009 and 85,000 for the month of March 2011.
Škoda Works was started as a firearms maker in 1859.
Škoda Auto goes back to the early 1890s as a company which started out making bicycles. In 1894, 26-year old Václav Klement (a bookseller in Mladá Boleslav) could not find any spare parts to fix his bicycle. Klement returned his bicycle to the makers, Seidel and Naumann, with a letter. It was written in Czech. The letter asked the company to repair the bicycle. When Klement got his reply, it was in German. It said (in English): "If you would like an answer to your inquiry, you should try writing in a language we can understand". Klement was very unhappy at this. Even though he did not have any experience, he decided to start a bicycle repair shop. He and Václav Laurin opened this in 1895 in Mladá Boleslav. Before working with Klement, Laurin was a bicycle maker in the town of Turnov. Turnov was near to Mladá Boleslav. In 1898, after moving to their newly-built factory, the pair bought a Werner "motorcyclist". It was made by French manufacturer Werner Brothers. Laurin & Klement's first motorcyclette was powered by an engine on the handlebars. It drove the front wheels. It was dangerous and unreliable. Laurin had an accident on it, and lost one of his front teeth. To design a safer motorcycle, the pair wrote to German specialist Robert Bosch for advice. The pair's new motorcycle went on sale in 1899.
In 1900, when the company had 32 people working for them, motorcycles began being exported. 150 machines were shipped to London. Shortly after, the press said that they were the makers of the first motorcycle. The first model, Voiturette A, was a success. The company was set up both within Austria-Hungary and all over the world. By 1905 the company was making automobiles.
After World War I, the Laurin-Klement company began making trucks. However, in 1924, the company looked for a partner after running into problems. It was bought by Škoda Works, a firearms maker. Most things made later were under the Škoda name. Škoda was successful again after an economic depression. The "Popular" in the late 1930s is an example of a popular car.
During World War II, when Nazi Germany had invaded Czechoslovakia, the Škoda works was turned into part of "Reichswerke Hermann Göring". It helped the German war effort.
This table shows the Škoda car models still being made.

Arakan is a Burmese state on the western coast of Myanmar. It is next to Bangladesh.
The term "Rakhine" may have come from the Pali word "Rakkhapura" from "Rakkhita" meaning the land of the people of Rakhasa (Rakhasa > Rakkha > Rakkhaing > Rakhaing) who were given this name in honor of their preservation of their national heritage and ethics or morality. The word Rakhine means, "one who maintains his own race." In the Rakhine language, the land is called "Rakhinepray", the ethnic Rakhine are called "Rakhinetha".
Arakan, used in British colonial times, is believed to be a Portuguese corruption of the word Rakhine that is still popularly used in English. Many English language users no not use the name changes made by the military government.

Waltari

Waltari is an alternative metal band from Finland. The band was formed in Helsinki in 1986. The original members were Kärtsy Hatakka, Sale Suomalainen and Jariot Lehtinen. Their name is a reference to popular Finish writer Mika Waltari – a favorite author of band’s guitarist Jariot Lethinen. 
Waltari is more famous in the rest of Europe than in Finland and the band members have very positive relationships to Czech Republic. They’ve collaborated with Czech punk rock band Wohnout and Kärtsy is a good friend of Lenka Dusilová. The band has collaborated with many other artists. They’ve made albums with Finnish ethno band Angelit, they hosted on Apocalyptica’s album and Tarja Turunen from Nightwish was a part of Yeah! Yeah! Die! Die! live performance.
Waltari's music is well known for it’s destruction of rock and metal genre boundaries. Their heavy sound is often combined with elements of electronic music, pop, rap, disco, funk, grindcore and bits of many other genres and creates a fusion which can be described as avant-garde. The lead singer and bass guitarist, Kärtsy Hattaka, delivers very distinctive vocal part to their music and makes Waltari's sound even more unique and easily recognizable. 
Waltari’s lyrics are as diverse as their music. They’re about various range of topics including everyday misery, personal struggles, science fiction motives, and music industry philosophical questions. They have one thing in common – heavy irony, self-irony and sarcasm. 
Waltari started their musical career with demo records. The longest one was "Monk Punk". This album presents an interesting mixture of punk and funk music, but the first release which provided the band more positive reviews was the album called "Torcha!" and it was also the first one which combined bits of many musical genres. It also includes the cover of Madonna’s song "Vogue".
Next two albums, "So Fine" and "Big Bang" were also very successful. They mainly concentrate on mixing heavy metal with techno, which was something fresh and innovative. Their biggest success among death metal fans yet came with the "Yeah! Yeah! Die! Die!" album, which is mixture of death metal and classical music. It also has a musical feeling to it, because it’s kind of an epic story from future sung in dialogues of various characters. 
Next album "Space Avenue" is more electronic and it has some pop feeling to it. Another one called "Radium Round" goes even further in that. It’s almost a pop/disco album with some metal elements. Waltari returned to more rock sound with albums like "Rare Species" and very successful "Blood Sample". Last two albums – "Release Date" and "Below Zero" are mainly focused on heavy sound with bits of progressive rock.

<doc id="316916" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316916" title="Multiple sclerosis">
Multiple sclerosis

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a serious health condition that gets worse over time. In this disease, the body’s natural guard against illness (the immune system) damages fatty coverings called myelin sheaths around the axons of cells called neurons in the central nervous system. The disease makes people’s bodies, eyesight, speech, and minds work poorly. People with MS do not normally live as long as healthy people.
In healthy people, myelin sheaths help neurons work. Electric signals in neurons move quickly through long, narrow axons like electricity in a wire. The myelin is like the insulator around the wire that keeps the signal strong by keeping it from moving out of the wire before the end. A person with MS has myelin that is too thin or completely gone. Without the protective covering, the signals between neurons do not travel well. Because of this, the mind and body cannot work like they normally do.
Scientists and doctors do not know for certain the cause of MS, but they think some things put some people at a higher risk for MS:
Research about the causes of MS is still incomplete. Some scientists think that a relatively unknown pathogen called Chlamydia pneumoniae may cause MS. Also, some viruses can cause myelin damage, there are other viruses that have been shown to make people more likely to get MS. Even though scientists and doctors have theories, no one has found one cause that explains every case of the disease.
Quite a few forms of MS exist, which can create difficulty in deciding how to manage the illness. The disease damages myelin. Sometimes, the body can do limited repairs to myelin. When this happens, symptoms (the problems caused by the disease) go away for a short time. This is called remission. When the body attacks the myelin again, the symptoms return and this is called relapse. The type of MS that has remissions and relapses is called Remitting-Relapsing MS. In less common cases, the body continues attacking myelin and the symptoms get worse rapidly, a form called "Primary Progressive MS". Sometimes a combination of the two types of disease can occur simultaneously.
People with MS have many problems. Their muscles are usually weak, they may shake uncontrollably, they have trouble moving, and they have trouble balancing. People with MS often feel a great amount of pain and tire easily. Their speech and sight sometimes become very poor. Thinking and solving problems is more difficult for people with MS than for healthy people. 
Inside the body, MS causes damage that cannot be seen or measured without special medical equipment. The immune system attacks either the fatty parts of the myelin or the protein parts of the myelin. The body may also attack the cells that produce the myelin sheath, called glial cells. When myelin is damaged or missing, large areas of axons affected by the damage are visible as scars or lesions in the central nervous system tissue that build up with repeated repair attempts by the body over time. Lesions appear in different areas of the central nervous system depending on what form of MS a person has.
Inflammation is an important part of MS symptoms. Inflammation occurs whenever an injury or illness is detected by the body. It is the first part of an immune system response. In MS patients, inflammation against myelin causes swelling and other harmful effects in the nervous system. Inflammation can happen due to infection by Chlamydia Pneumoniae. 
The people who get MS are usually between 20 and 40 years old, although it can happen to older or, very rarely, younger people too. MS is significantly more common in areas of the world that are far away from the equator. Areas far from the equator get less sunlight than areas near the equator, and the human body requires sunlight to make vitamin D for itself. This observation supports the idea that MS is caused partly by too little vitamin D. People who move from one part of the world to another when they are children are more likely to develop MS than people who do not move long distances until later in life or who never move long distances. This observation supports the idea that MS is caused by infection from Chlamydia Pneumoniae early in life, because people who move from one natural environment to another can get unfamiliar illnesses which their immune systems are unable to fight.
To diagnose MS, or to tell if a person has it, a doctor will determine what kind of symptoms are present and how often they occur. The most common guidelines used for this are called the McDonald criteria, which define the symptoms of MS and how often they must occur in order to make a diagnosis. A doctor can also order tests to be done by a laboratory, which can determine how active the immune system is in the patient. A special machine called an MRI can photograph the inside of the central nervous system to show if the person has lesions from damaged myelin. Certain types of neurons can be checked to see how responsive they are. Neurons with damaged myelin around their axons will respond more slowly than normal neurons.
Once a person is diagnosed with MS, a doctor can help ease the symptoms. Scientists have not yet found a way to cure MS, or take it away entirely. The form of MS that comes and goes regularly can be treated more easily than other forms. Some treatments are used only during attacks to make the attacks easier on the patient or to help recovery after the attacks are over. Other treatments are used all the time to help make attacks happen less often. These kinds of treatments are usually injections or infusions directly into veins, but newer treatments can be taken daily by mouth instead. Some people seek other treatments outside of usual medicine, but these have not been shown in scientific studies to be effective.

Walter Raleigh

Sir Walter Raleigh (c. 1554–29 October 1618) was an English aristocrat, writer, poet, soldier, spy, and explorer. He helped make tobacco popular in England, especially among people in the royal court.
Raleigh was born to a Protestant family in East Budle, in Devon, the son of Walter Raleigh and Catherine Champernowne. Walter Raleigh was married to a woman called Elizabeth Throckmorten. He had 3 sons named Damerei Raleigh, Walter Raleigh and Carew Raleigh.
In 1594, Raleigh heard of a "City of Gold" in South America and sailed to find it, writing an exaggerated story of his trip in a book. He explored North Carolina all the way down to Florida. This book made people believe in the legend of "El Dorado". After Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, Raleigh was put in prison because he was accused of trying to overthrow King James I, who did not like Raleigh. In 1616, he was released to go look for El Dorado again. This was unsuccessful, and Raleigh's men attacked a Spanish outpost. He returned to England. The Spanish were upset, so to calm them, England arrested Raleigh and executed him by beheading (decapitation) on 29 October, 1618.

The rings of Uranus are planetary rings (circles of rock and dust) that go around the planet Uranus. There are 11 rings in total. In order of increasing distance from Uranus, they are: 1986U2R/ζ, 6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, λ, ε, ν and μ.
Nine rings were found on 10 March 1977 by James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham and Douglas J. Mink. Scientists found two more rings in 1986 in images from the Voyager 2 spacecraft and two outer rings in 2003–2005 in images from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Most of the rings are only a few kilometres wide and are very dark. Most rings are made of rocks 0.2–20 meters wide. But some rings are made of very small dust particles. The closest ring is 38,000 km away from the center of Uranus and the furthest ring is 98,000 km away.
Scientists think that the rings are at not more than 600 million years old. The ring system was created when several moons crashed together. After crashing, the moons broke up into many pieces and made rings.People may discover more rings.

Populus

Populus is a genus of trees common in the northern hemisphere. They are commonly called poplars. The genus has 25–35 species in three sub-groups, commonly called poplars, aspens, and cottonwoods.
In the September 2006 issue of "Science", it was announced that the Western Balsam Poplar ("P. trichocarpa") was the first tree to have its full DNA code sequenced.
The flowers are mostly dioecious (rarely monoecious) and appear in early spring before the leaves. They are borne in long, drooping catkins. The male flowers have a group of 4–60 stamens on a disk. The female flower is a single-celled ovary in a cup-shaped disk. 
Pollination is by wind. The fruit is a two to four-valved capsule, green to reddish-brown, mature in mid summer. It contains tiny light brown seeds surrounded by tufts of long, soft, white hairs which help wind dispersal.
Poplars of the cottonwood section are often wetlands or riparian trees. The aspens are among the most important boreal broadleaf trees.
Poplars and aspens are important food plants for the larvae of a large number of Lepidoptera species. "Pleurotus populinus", the aspen oyster mushroom, is found exclusively on dead wood of "Populus" trees in North America.

Equilibrium constant

For a general chemical equilibrium
the equilibrium constant can be defined by
where {A} is the activity of the chemical species A, etc. (activity is a dimensionless quantity). It is conventional to put the activities of the products in the numerator and those of the reactants in the denominator.
For equilibria in solution, activity is the product of concentration and activity coefficient. Most chemists determine equilibrium constants in a solution with a high ionic strength. In high strength solutions, the quotient of activity coefficients changes very little. So, the equilibrium constant is defined as a concentration quotient:

Bashar al-Assad

Bashar Hafez al-Assad (born 11 September 1965) is the president of Syria and the head of the Ba'ath Party in Syria. 
Assad has had those jobs since the death of his father Hafez al-Assad (1930-2000), who had ruled Syria since 1971. Bashar al-Assad was elected in 2000, and re-elected in 2007. He was unopposed each time because no-one else was allowed to stand against him.
Assad was born on 11 September 1965 in Damascus, Syria to Hafez al-Assad. He had two brothers, Bassel al-Assad and Shabbih Maher al-Assad, and one sister, Bushra al-Assad. Bashar was quiet and reserved and says that he lacked interest in politics or the military.
Assad studied medicine at the University of Damascus and graduated in 1988. He then studied ophthalmology at a military hospital, and in 1992 studied at the Western Eye Hospital in London. 
His father wanted Assad's elder brother Bassel to succeed him as leader of Syria. Bassel died in a car accident in 1994, and Assad returned home to Syria. 
He went to a military academy at Homs, and became a colonel after only five years. He worked as an adviser to his father, and took action against corruption. 
When his father died, the government changed the constitution. Under Syrian law the president had to be at least 40 years old. With law changed, Assad was able to be elected President of Syria in June 2000. He was also made commander in chief of the armed forces, and leader of the Ba'ath Party which has ruled Syria since 1961.
Since March 2011, civil war is taking place in Syria. He has responded the protest and violence with the use of his force. By June 2013, 93,000 people have been killed from all sides.
Bashar was considered a younger-generation Arab leader, who would bring change to Syria, a region long filled with aging dictators. He is well-educated, and many believed he would be capable of transforming his father's iron-rule regime into a modern state.
Assad is married to Asma al-Akhras. Together, they have three children; Hafez, Jr., Zein, and Karim al-Assad.
Influenced by his western education and urban upbringing, Bashar initially seemed eager to implement a cultural revolution in Syria.

Carbon diet

Carbon diet is the process of reducing the production of greenhouse gas, primarily carbon dioxide, to reduce effects on climate change and global warming.
Carbon dioxide is produced from heating, driving and consuming products.
The production of carbon dioxide can be reduced by decreasing the intake of carbon, and eventually reduces the effects of climate change.
According to Deborah Jones, her family undergoes carbon diet. They are already in week two of the Globe and Mail assignment. The purpose of this assignment is to see how her family can reduces the emissions of greenhouse gas to reach the provincial goal of 33 percent reduction. It is different from a low carbon diet which is done by choosing what to eat to reduce greenhouse gas discharge.
Carbon is from Latin word carbo "coal" is the chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6. As a member of group 14 on the periodic table, it is nonmetallic and tetravalent—making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. There are three naturally occurring isotopes, with 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is radioactive, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years.
The term "carbon diet" is used in book Gore:A Political Life. There are steps in carbon diet:

Numerical control

Numerical Control (NC) is a way to automate machines. In numerical control, the commands these machines get come from a storage medium; they are not controlled and operated manually. The first such machines were Jacquard looms controlled by punched cards. Machine tools for cutting metal were built in the 1940s and 1950s. They used punched tape instructions. Soon, the tools were changed, to use computers. Numerical control with computers is known as Computerized numerical control, or CNC.
Nowadays, it is possible to make a program that can run on such machine tools, based on a CAD drawing of the piece to be produced.
Attempts to automate machines in the 19th century, for example copying-lathes, used cams. These are basically wheels that change the position of notches to control a machine. The basic difference to modern NC is that these cams only automated one given task; modern NC and CNC machines can be programmed to a greater extent.

Mid-Atlantic Ridge

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is where seafloor spreading takes place in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. It is part of a world-wide system of mid-ocean ridges. These ridges make up the longest mountain range in the world, all underwater except for short stretches like Iceland. On Iceland, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge reaches the surface.
The ridge separates oceanic tectonic plates, and moves the plates apart at about 2.5 cm per year.
The Mid-Atlantic Ridge includes a deep rift valley which runs along the middle of the ridge along almost its entire length. At the rift, the boundary between tectonic plates, magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor. New magma emerges onto the ocean floor near the ridge axis. The crystallized magma forms new crust of basalt and gabbro.
The ridge was discovered during the expedition of HMS "Challenger" in 1872. A team of scientists on board discovered a large rise in the middle of the Atlantic. They were planning the future location for a transatlantic telegraph cable. The existence of such a ridge was confirmed by sonar in 1925 
In the 1950s, mapping of the Earth’s ocean floors showed the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to have valleys and ridges. Its central valley is seismologically active and the epicentre of many earthquakes. Ewing and Heezen discovered the ridge to be part of a 40,000-km-long essentially continuous system of mid-ocean ridges on the floors of all the Earth’s oceans. The discovery of this worldwide ridge system led to the theory of seafloor spreading and general acceptance of Wegener's theory of continental drift and expansion as plate tectonics.
The ridge started forming in at the end of the Triassic period, and was responsible for the separation of the Americas from Africa and Europe with the breakup of Pangaea.
The ridge sits atop a geologic feature known as the Mid-Atlantic Rise which is a progressive bulge that runs the length of the Atlantic Ocean, with the ridge resting on the highest point of this linear bulge. This bulge is thought to be caused by upward convective forces in the asthenosphere pushing up the oceanic crust and lithosphere.

It shows the comparison between the size of the outside of an object and the amount it can hold inside it. Small objects have a large surface area compared to the volume. This gives them a large ratio of surface to volume. Larger objects have small surface area compared to the volume so they have a small surface area to volume ratio.

Metabolism (architecture)

Metabolism is a kind of architecture that began in Japan around 1960. This way of designing buildings came out of the rebuilding of Japan after World War II. Members of the group include: Kiyoshi Awazu, Noboru Kawazoe, Kiyonori Kikutake, Kisho Kurokawa, Fumihiko Maki, Masato Otaka, and Kenzō Tange. They wrote a short book in English and Japanese called "The proposals for a New Urbanism" for the World Design Conference in 1960. Many Metabolist projects or designs were very large city plans called "megastructures". The members thought of cities as living things that changed over long periods of time.
These architects were interested in building housing for large numbers of people. They often planned buildings that could be changed. One example is the Nakagin Capsule Tower by Kurokawa (1972). Each apartment was a rectangular block with one round window. These blocks could be added, moved, or removed as needed. It was a "plug-in building". Kurokawa planned for new, better capsules to be added to replace old ones. However, people living in the tower plan to tear it down and rebuild a larger building.

Nakagin Capsule Tower

The is a building designed by architect Kisho Kurokawa. It has apartments and offices in it. The tower is in Shimbashi, Tokyo, Japan. Nakagin Capsule Tower is an example of the Metabolism style of architecture. It was the first modular capsule building.
The building is actually two towers. One is eleven and the other is thirteen floors. These towers are the utility cores. They have the elevators, stairs, electric, and water services in them. They also support the whole building. 140 capsules are attached to the two cores. Each capsule unit is one apartment or office. They are × × and have one round window. Just four bolts connect each unit to a tower. The units are lightweight steel. They were built in Shiga Prefecture and brought to Tokyo on trucks. The capsules are not connected to each other, so any capsule can be removed or replaced without moving the others.
The towers are the permanent part of the building and the capsules were temporary. Kurokawa planned for new units to be built to replace old ones. As building technology improved, better units could be added. Also, units could be changed as people moved in or out. Capsules could even be moved from one building to another. This part of the plan never happened. No new capsules were ever built.
Residents plan to tear down the building. They say there are problems with asbestos and that the building is too old and has not been repaired well. Kurokawa and other architects want to keep the building as an historic example.

It makes use of the Wii MotionPlus add-on for the Wii Remote. The player uses the Wii Remote to swing Link's sword.
Link is the hero in this game. Zelda is Link's childhood friend, and the heroine in the story. Girahim: is the bad person who schemes to revive an ancient evil boss.

Arab Spring

The Arab Spring (, ) is a term used in the media for the revolutionary wave of demonstrations and protests (both non-violent and violent), riots, and civil wars in the Arab world that began on 18 December 2010.
Rulers have been forced from power in Tunisia, Egypt (twice), Libya and Yemen. Civil uprisings have occurred in Bahrain and Syria. Major protests have occurred in Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco and Sudan. Minor protests have occurred in Mauritania, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Djibouti, Western Sahara and Palestine. There have been minor protests in countries that are not part of the Arab World, such as Iran and Israel.
There were border clashes in Israel and the protests in Iranian Khuzestan by the Arab minority occurred in 2011. Weapons and Tuareg fighters returning from the Libyan civil war had encouraged a conflict in Mali which has been described as "fallout" from the Arab Spring in North Africa. The sectarian clashes in Lebanon were described as a spillover violence of the Syrian uprising and hence the regional Arab Spring.
The protests have shared some techniques of civil resistance in sustained campaigns involving strikes, demonstrations, marches, and rallies, as well as the effective use of social media to organize, communicate, and raise awareness in the face of state attempts at repression and Internet censorship.
Many Arab Spring demonstrations have been met with violent responses from authorities, as well as from pro-government militias and counter-demonstrators. These attacks have been answered with violence from protestors in some cases. A major slogan of the demonstrators in the Arab world has been "Ash-sha`b yurid isqat an-nizam" ("the people want to bring down the regime").
Some observers have compared the Arab Spring movements to the Revolutions of 1989 that occurred in Eastern Europe or the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states.
The first specific use of the term "Arab Spring" as used to signify these events may have started with the American political journal "Foreign Policy". Marc Lynch, referring to his article in "Foreign Policy", writes "Arab Spring—a term I may have unintentionally coined in a January 6, 2011 article". Joseph Massad on "Al Jazeera" said the term was "part of a US strategy of controlling [the movement's] aims and goals" and directing it towards American-style liberal democracy. Due to the electoral success of Islamist parties before protests began in many Arab countries, the events have also come to be known as "Islamist Spring" or "Islamist Winter".
The series of protests and demonstrations across the Middle East and North Africa has become known as the "Arab Spring", and sometimes as the "Arab Spring and Winter" even though not all the participants in the protests are Arab. It was sparked by the first protests that occurred in Tunisia on 18 December 2010 following Mohamed Bouazizi's self-immolation in protest of police corruption and ill treatment. The protests also triggered similar unrest outside the region resembling a 'chain effect'.

Guangzhou

Guangzhou is the capital of Guangdong Province of China. Historically, it was known to Westerners as Canton, which is a misnomer, or a mistake in naming, since the name is an older English pronunciation for the entire region that the city is in, Guangdong. It is also called the City of Flowers. It is in the south of China and is one of the five biggest cities in China. In mainland China, Guangzhou is regarded as one of the three most popular cities with Beijing and Shanghai, which is called Bei-Shang-Guang for short. It is where the 16th Asian Games were held and it is famous for its food all over the world.
Guangzhou is the core city of South China. It is on the north of Zhu Jiang Delta (Pearl River Delta), where the Dong Jiang River (East River), Xi Jiang River (West River) and Bei Jiang River (North River) join together. On its South is the South China Sea. With its geographical advantages, Guangzhou has been a very important port in South China for hundreds of years. Today, it is the biggest and most important port for air, sea, and trains in China. The area of Guangzhou is about . The north part and middle part of Guangzhou are hills. The west part and south part are plains that have a lot of rivers and streams. Guangzhou is in the subtropics monsoon climate region. It has a lot of sunshine and rain. The average temperature is from 21.4 to 21.9 °C (about 71 °F) and the lowest temperature in winter is about . The rainy season lasts for almost six months and the typhoons in summer also bring lots of rain. The average humidity is about 77 percent.
Guangzhou has Baiyun Airport, which is one of the three most important parts of air transportation in the country. The passenger throughput ranks third in China and 19th in the world. It is also a very important harbor in China, second to Shenzhen in South China and the fourth one in the country. With the Jing-Guang Railway, Jing-Jiu Railway, Guang-Shen Railway and other railways, Guangzhou has become one of the four biggest railway passenger stations in China. A high speed railway has been built here.
Guangzhou has been the city famous for business for hundreds of years. It has been open to the world for nearly 2000 years. After the Reform and Opening Up in 1979, Guangzhou has gained great economic achievement. For example, Guangzhou's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) has grown about 14% per year. It ranks as the third economic city in China (not including Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao). In addition, Guangzhou has become a city with a sound industrial foundation and developed tertiary-industry. In September of 1993, Guangzhou was accepted as a member of the World Association of Metropolises.

<doc id="317217" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317217" title="Gas discharge lamp">
Gas discharge lamp

Gas discharge lamps are a family of artificial light sources (or lamps). These lamps produce light by sending electricity through an ionized gas. Most of these lamps use a noble gas, or a combination of noble gases, but they often contain other materials, such as mercury, sodium or metal halides. The gases in these lamps are ionized in operation. This means that there are free electrons. When an electric current is sent through the gas, electrons collide with atoms of the gas and the metals. This will mean that some reach a higher energy state. When they fall back into the lower energy state, they will emit the energy in the form of light. 
The fluorescent lamp is probably the best known gas discharge lamp. Sodium vapor lamps are commonplace as streetlights.
Gas-discharge lamps have a long life and a high efficiency, but they are more complicated to manufacture, which makes them more expensive to buy than incandescent lamps. Due to their greater efficiency, gas-discharge lamps replacing incandescent light bulbs for many purposes in the late 20th century. Early in the 21st century, light-emitting diodes improved, with even higher efficiency. They began to replace some gas discharge lamps.

Charged particle

A charged particle, also called an ion, is an atom with a positive or negative charge. This happens whenever something called an ionic bond forms. Two particles that have different numbers of electrons (the smallest particle in an atom which is negative) start reacting to each other. The particle that has the greater amount of electrons steals the other particle's electrons. One becomes positive because it lost an electron, and the other negative because it got another electron. The two particles become attracted to each other and mix together, making a new kind of particle.

Piano concerto

A piano concerto is a concerto written for piano and orchestra.
A classical piano concerto is often in three movements.
Examples by Mozart and Beethoven follow this model, but there are many others which do not. Beethoven's fourth piano concerto includes a last-movement cadenza, and many composers have made innovations – for example Liszt's single-movement concerti.

Unilineal evolution

Unilineal evolution, also called classical social evolution, was a 19th-century social theory about the evolution of societies and cultures. 
There were different theories by various sociologists and anthropologists. However, they all believed that Western culture is the peak of social evolution. Social status is seen as a single line that goes from most primitive to most civilized. This theory is now generally considered obsolete in universities.

In the "Ōnin" era, the emperor gave Yoshimasa's villa with a special name -- "Higashiyama-dono"., Construction work was interrupted by the Ōnin War.
The "Ōnin" War started in 1467. This conflict is called "Ōnin no ran" because of the nengō in which it began. The fighting began as a dispute over who should follow Ashikaga Yoshimasa as shogun after his retirement – whether it would be his brother (Yoshimi) or his son (Yoshihisa). 
Rival groups of daimyo fought for military supremacy. In the end, there was no winner. The war stopped because the factions simply exhausted themselves.

<doc id="317385" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317385" title="Ballistic coefficient">
Ballistic coefficient

In ballistics, the ballistic coefficient (BC) of a bullet is a measure of its ability to overcome air resistance in flight. A high BC means the object will slow down less. It will have more of its speed left when it reaches the target. BC depends on mass, diameter, and drag coefficient. Ballistic coefficient has units of lb/in² or kg/m². BCs for bullets are normally stated in lb/in² by their manufacturers without referring to this unit. The values for BC can be as low as 0.12 and as high as 1.00 for commonly used bullets.
A bullet with a high BC will travel farther than one with a low BC since it will keep its speed better, resist the wind better, and “shoot flatter” (see external ballistics).
When hunting with a rifle, a higher BC is good for several reasons. A higher BC results in a flatter flight. The effect of mistakes in estimating the distance to the target is smaller for bullet with a higher BC. This is important when attempting an effective hit on a game animal. If the target animal is closer than estimated, then the bullet will hit higher than expected. On the other hand, if the animal is further than estimated the bullet will hit lower than expected. Such a difference in bullet drop can make the difference between a clean kill and a wounded animal.
This difference in flight path becomes more important at longer distances. Sometimes, the difference in two bullet designs fired from the same rifle can result in a difference between the two of over 30 cm (1 foot) at 500 meters (550 yards). A bullet with a high BC arrives at the target faster and with more energy than one with a low BC.
Since the higher BC bullet gets to the target faster, it is also less affected by crosswinds.
Sporting bullets have BC’s in the range 0.12 to slightly over 1.00, with high being the most aerodynamic, and low being the least. Very-low-drag bullets with BCs ≥ 1.10 can be designed and produced on special lathes using mono-metal rods. These special bullets often have to be fired from custom made full bore rifles with special barrels.
Bullet makers often offer several weights and types for a given size. Heavy-for-caliber pointed (spitzer) bullets with a boat tail design have high BCs. Lighter bullets with square tails and blunt noses have lower BCs. 
In the United States, hunting cartridges such as the .25-06 Remington (a 6.35 mm caliber), the .270 Winchester (a 6.8 mm caliber), and the .284 Winchester (a 7 mm caliber) are used when high BCs are desired.
In the larger sizes, the .338 Lapua Magnum and the .50 BMG are popular with very high BC bullets for shooting beyond 1000 meters. They have very high BCs. Other choices in the larger size are the .375 and .408 Cheyenne Tactical and the .416 Barrett.
Differences in BC claims for exactly the same projectiles can be explained by differences in the air density used for these BC statements or differing range-speed measurements on which the stated G1 BC averages are based. The BC changes during a projectile's flight and stated BCs are always averages for certain distances and speeds. Some more explanation about the transient nature of a projectile's G1 BC during flight can be found at the external ballistics article. This article suggests that knowing how a BC was established is almost as important as knowing the stated BC value itself.
To find the correct BC (osome scientists would call it drag coefficients), Doppler radar-measurements are required. The normal shooting or aerodynamics person, however, does not have this expensive equipment. Weibel 1000e Doppler radars are used by governments, professional ballisticians, defense forces, and a few ammunition manufacturers to get exact real world data on the flight behavior of projectiles of interest.
Test results came from many shots, not just a single shot. Any single bullet can have a very different BC than another. It is important to know the average behavior of a bullet. How different speed regimes affect several rifle bullets made by Lapua can be seen in the .338 Lapua Magnum product brochure which states Doppler radar established BC data.
Most ballistic mathematical models and hence tables or software assume that one specific drag function correctly describes the drag and hence the flight characteristics of a bullet related to its ballistics coefficient. Those models do not have any differences for wadcutter, flat-based, spitzer, boat-tail, very-low-drag, etc. bullet types or shapes. However, some different drag curve models have been made for several standard projectile shapes.
These free computer programs can be used to calculate ballistic coefficient if other information is known.

Dr. Dre

Andre Romelle Young (born February 18, 1964), known as Dr. Dre is an American record producer, rapper, and entrepreneur. He has had many records and songs throughout the years and is one of the most famous producers in hip-hop. He has made albums for many rappers through their careers, including "Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50 Cent and Game". As of 2011, "Dr. Dre" is ranked as the third richest rapper by Forbes and is worth two-hundred & fifty million dollars ($250,000,000). Dre began his career in music as a member of the World Class Wreckin' Cru and he later found fame with the gangsta rap group N.W.A. with Eazy-E, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and DJ Yella which made the use of swear words in rap songs in rap to tell about the violence of street life popular. During the 2000s, he produced music for other artists, while sometimes rapping with other artists' on their songs. Dr. Dre signed Eminem to his "Aftermath" record label in 1998 and 50 Cent in 2003 helping to make their albums with them. Rolling Stone magazine said Dr. Dre was one of the richest performers in 2001 and 2004. Dr. Dre was also in movies such as Set It Off, and the 2001 movies The Wash and Training Day.
Because he liked Grandmaster Flash, he often went to a club called The Eve After Dark to see a lot of DJs and rappers performing live. He then became a DJ in the club, at first under the name "Dr. J", his favourite basketball player. At the club, he met DJ Yella for the first time. Soon afterwards he started using the name "Dr. Dre", half his old nickname, and half his first name, also calling himself as the "Master of Mixology". He later joined the musical group World Class Wreckin' Cru in 1984. The group would become stars of the electro-hop scene that was really popular in early 1980s West Coast hip hop, and their first hit "Surgery" would feature Dr. Dre on the turntables and sell 50,000 tapes within Compton. Dr. Dre and DJ Yella also did mixes for local radio stations, making the ratings for it's show "Afternoon Traffic Jam" go higher. Dr. Dre's earliest songs were released in 1994 on a CD called "Concrete Roots". 
He was a diver in high school, but because he skipped school a lot, he was kicked off the team. After high school, he went to Chester Adult School in Compton because his mother told him to get a job or go back to school. After going to a broadcasting school for a little bit, he moved to his father's house, and then his grandparents house before going back to his mother's house. He later dropped out of Chester to focus on performing at the Eve's After Dark nightclub.
In 1986, Dr. Dre met Ice Cube, who with Dr. Dre, made songs for Ruthless Records, a rap record label run by local rapper Eazy-E. N.W.A and fellow West Coast rapper Ice-T are normally said to be the creators of gangsta rap. N.W.A favoured themes and explicit lyrics, offering real descriptions of violent, inner-city streets. With the hit "Fuck tha Police", the group's first full album Straight Outta Compton became a big hit, despite almost no radio airplay or concerts. The FBI sent Eazy-E a warning letter for the song's content.
After Ice Cube left N.W.A in 1989 over money issues, Dr. Dre produced and performed for much of the group's second album Efil4Zaggin (Niggas for life). He also produced tracks for other rap acts on Ruthless Records, including The D.O.C.'s 1989 album "No One Can Do It Better". In 1991, at a party in Hollywood, he slapped Dee Barnes of the TV show Pump it Up, feeling upset about a news report she did about the feud between them and Ice Cube. Dr. Dre was fined $2,500 and given two years' probation and 240 hours of community service, as well as a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement on television.
After an argument with Eazy-E over money, Dre left the group in 1991 under the advice of a friend, The D.O.C. and his bodyguard at the time, Suge Knight. Knight, a known strongman, was able to have Eazy-E release Dre from his contract and, start Death Row Records. In 1992 Dre released his first single with Snoop Dogg; "Deep Cover". Dr. Dre's first album was "The Chronic". Dre brought a new style of rap, both in terms of style and words.
The Chronic became really popular and had lots of big singles. Its sound was really popular with hip hop music for the early 1990s. In 1993, Dr. Dre also won a Grammy Award for "Let Me Ride". That year, Billboard magazine Dr. Dre was the eighth best-selling musical artist, "The Chronic" was the sixth best-selling album, and "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang" (the first single from the album) as the 11th best-selling single.
Besides working on his own music, Dr. Dre produced Snoop Dogg's first album Doggystyle. In 1994, Dr. Dre produced some songs on the soundtracks for the films Above the Rim and Murder Was the Case. He rapped with fellow ex-N.W.A member Ice Cube for the song "Natural Born Killaz" in 1995. For the film Friday, Dre recorded "Keep Their Heads Ringin"', which reached No.10 in the charts.
In 1995, just as Death Row Records signed 2Pac, Young left the label because of a contract dispute and he was worried that Suge Knight wasn't doing things legally. In 1996, he made his own label, Aftermath Entertainment, with Interscope Records. Death Row then suffered poor sales in 1997, after the death of 2Pac.
Dr. Dre released Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath, released in 1996, with songs by Dr.dre new Aftermath Entertainment rappers. "Been There, Done That", was saying that he was bored of gangsta rap. Despite selling a lot of copies of the album, it was not very popular among music fans. In October 1996, Dre rapped "Been There, Done That" on popular American TV show, Saturday Night Live. 
Despite the mixed reception to his label's album, Dr. Dre was on two No.1 singles in the charts in 1996, they were "California Love" by 2Pac and "No Diggity" by Blackstreet. They were Dr. Dre's first No.1 songs since being with N.W.A.
Aftermath gained more popularity in 1998, Dr. Dre signed Eminem, a rapper from Detroit. Dre produced three songs and sung with him on two of them on Eminem's first album The Slim Shady LP. "My Name Is", the first single from the album, made Eminem famous. The album sold lots of copies. 
Dr. Dre's second album, "2001", released in 1999, was his return to gangsta rap. It was at first called The Chronic 2000 as a sequel to his first album The Chronic, but was changed to 2001 after Death Row released an unrelated album called "Chronic 2000: Still Smokin" in 1999. The album has also been called by fans 'The Chronic 2001' and 'The Chronic 2'. The album featured a lot of guests, including Devin the Dude, Hittman, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Nate Dogg and Eminem. The album was really good, charting at number two and has since sold millions of copies. The album included popular hit singles "Still D.R.E." and "Forgot About Dre", both of which Dr. Dre performed on Saturday Night Live in 1999. Dr. Dre won an award for Producer of the Year, in 2000, and joined the Up in Smoke Tour with Eminem, Snoop Dogg, and Ice Cube. In 2001, Dr. Dre was sued a few times.
In 2002, Dr. Dre said he was going to release a new album: Detox. The album has been being made since 2004 and was to be released in 2005. After loads of delays, the album was to be released in 2010. Producers confirmed to be working on the album are DJ Khalil, Nottz, Bernard "Focus" Edwards Jr., Hi-Tek, J.R. Rotem, RZA, Jay-Z, Warren G, and Boi-1da. Snoop Dogg said the album was finished in 2008 but it still wasn't released. Detox was then to be released in 2010. At the beginning of 2009, Dre was in the song "Crack a Bottle" by Eminem & 50 Cent. In a Dr Pepper advert in 2009, he played a small clip from Detox. 50 Cent and Eminem said in an interview with BET that Dr. Dre had around 12 songs for Detox. Detox is said to be released sometime in 2012. The first two singles, "Kush" and "I Need a Doctor", were released in 2010 and 2011. "Kush" has become a hit in the America and "I Need a Doctor" peaked at Number Four in the charts. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers will honour Dr. Dre with its Founders Award for inspiring other musicians.
In 2010, Dr. Dre said that an album of just music called The Planets is in its first stages of production; each song being named after a planet. Later that year, Dr. Dre showed support to long time friend Eminem, and appeared at his and Jay-Z's Tour, performing songs "Still D.R.E.," "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang," and "Crack a Bottle," with Eminem & 50 Cent. Wearing an "R.I.P. Proof" shirt (proof was a rapper who died, he was also a friend of Dre, Eminem & 50 Cent). The crowd the chanted "DEEE-TOX," to which he replied, "I'm coming!" As if to say the album's release is not that long away. Dr. Dre was featured on the cover of a magazine in a 2011 issue. After Detox he will be one of the producers of Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins' album Still Cool. In 2012 Dre was announced to headline at a music festival called the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival taking place the weekends of April 13–15 and April 20–22 which featured a holographic 2Pac.
Dr. Dre has also founded the company Beats Electronics, LLC. It primarily makes headphones under the brand "Beats by Dr. Dre".

So Weird was a Disney Channel television show about a girl of 14 called Fiona Phillips, played by Cara Delizia. She was obsessed with the occult. She was the daughter of a singer named Molly Phillips, played by Mackenzie Phillips, and had a brother, age 16, named Jack. Fiona was played by Cara Delizia.
In the series her singer mother homeschools her and they travel around the country by bus. In the series Fi's brother is skeptical of the occult. Their father was obsessed with it but died when Fi was only 3. Later on in the series Fi meets an entity called a will o' the wisp who seems to know her father and gives her information about him. He takes possession of her brother Jack's body in one episode until she expels him by discovering his name and saying it through a computer puzzle based on a hint he gives her. His name is Bricriu. Bricriu in a later episode takes possession of her mother's body and tries to prevent her from meeting a man who knows who killed her father. Bricriu lets slip to her that his allies in the spirit, although not Bricriu himself, murdered her father because of his investigations into their world. He finally meets Fi again in the first episode of season 3 and convinces her to give up interest in the occult in order to protect her family. Fi stopped appearing in the show after that episode. Fi met her father by time traveling to her third year in the episode Fountain. The first two seasons of the show, particularly the second, were dark. In the second season Fi even meets vampires. However, in the third season Disney decided to choose a lighter tone. Also Delizia left the show in the third season so she was replaced by Alex Johnson who played a new character called Annie who replaced Fi.

She has been called "the greatest Spanish gypsy dancer of her generation". and "the most extrardinary personality of all time in flamenco dance".
She danced from the time she was 4 years old. Accompanied on the guitar by her father, she danced in waterfront bars in Barcelona. A young person who saw her dance as a girl was the Spanish guitarist Sabicas (Agustín Castellón Campos). He later said "I saw her dance and it seemed like something supernatural to me... I never saw anyone dance like her. I don’t know how she did it, I just don’t know!". Sabicas accompanied her for many years. He recorded "Queen of the Gypsies" (1959) and "Flamenco!" with Amaya.
In 1929, she made her debut in Paris, to warm acclaims and admiration of her dancing skill. She moved to America in 1936, where she went on to act in several movies that broke box office records, including the "Romeo and Juliet" adaptation "Los Tarantos", and the short movie "Danzas Gitanas" (Gypsy dances). 
One thing was strange about her: she often danced in trousers rather than the layered skirt traditional for female flamenco dancers. One theory is that she did this to give more scope to her footwork, which was exceptional, and rather like a flamenco male dancer. Apparently, in early flamenco, women did not do so much footwork, and male dancers used to fill in the steps while sitting on chairs, unseen in the wings. Her style has been described as repetitive because she always did the same dances: "Carmen was a fabulous dancer, but limited" (Antonio Ruiz Soler).
She was invited by Franklin Roosevelt to dance in the White House in 1944, and also by Harry S. Truman in 1953.
Amaya is buried in the Cementiri del Sud-Oest on Barcelona's Montjuïc.

A foam is a substance that is formed by trapping gas in bubbles. Gas is present in large amounts so it will be divided in gas bubbles separated by liquid regions which may form films, thinner and thinner when the liquid phase is drained out of the system.

Cast member

A cast member is:
Most television series have a "regular cast" or "main cast". These are the actors who are regularly on the show each week. They are commonly called just "regulars" or "main characters". Programs will often need other actors to play smaller roles in the series. These are called "guest stars". A guest star may only be used for a single episode or they may be used for more than one. This often happens if the character's story goes on for more than one episode. Often, a character will be used for many episodes, but over a long period of time not for episodes shown one after the other. These are called "recurring characters" and are characters that are not "regulars", they are not part of the main cast, but are used many times during the series.
The word cast comes from the Old English word ' "casten" ' or ' "kasta" '(c.1230). The Old English means to throw in, to consider, plot, imagine, and design. This led to its meaning when referring to a "group of actors in a play" (c.1631).

Online shopping

Online shopping is the process whereby consumers directly buy goods or services from a seller in real-time, without an intermediary service, over the Internet. It is a form of electronic commerce. An online shop, eshop, e-store, Internet shop, webshop, webstore, online store, or virtual store evokes the physical analogy of buying products or services at a bricks-and-mortar retailer or in a shopping center. The process is called business-to-consumer (B2C) online shopping. When a business buys from another business, it is called business-to-business (B2B) online shopping.
In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee created the first World Wide Web server and browser. It opened for commercial use in 1991 . In 1994 other advances took place, such as online banking and the opening of an online pizza shop by Pizza Hut. During that same year, Netscape introduced SSL encryption of data transferred online, which has become essential for secure online shopping. Also, in 1994, the German company Intershop introduced its first online shopping system. In 1995, Amazon launched its online shopping site, and in 1996, eBay appeared.
A good online store is easy to navigate and browse for possible purchases. It has a product catalog that customers can use to browse the search criteria (usually a type, price, material, age, etc.), information about the products, the sellers, and the service center. Online stores may also discuss business conditions and a Complaints Procedure.
If a shopper finds a product to purchase, clicking "send" will add the item to the shopping cart. The shopping cart collects all items to be purchased. Once a shopper is satisfied with their selections, the shopper makes a binding order and payment using a credit card or other financial arrangement. Therefore, implementing usability testing is highly important for an online store to avoid the reduce of overall performances of the online store 
In the twenty first century, online shopping has become very popular, especially with the lifestyles of business people who are always busy and are looking for a convenient way to shop.

Ovipositor

An ovipositor is the long hollow tube on the rear of female insects (and some other animals). Through this tube they lay eggs. The ovipositor is formed by the union of three pairs of rear appendages. 
In many species it is a piercing organ which allows the insect to put its eggs into a specific place. In some species of wasp, the female drills through tree bark with her ovipositor and lays eggs in the bodies of grubs eating under the bark. 
However, in many hymenoptera the ovipositor is used as a sting, and the female does not use it for egg-laying.

Zork

Zork was one of the first interactive fiction computer games and a descendant of Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of "Zork" was written in 1977–1979. 
"Zork" was originally MIT hacker slang for an unfinished program. The creators named the completed game "Dungeon", but changed it back to "Zork" after receiving a trademark violation notice from the publisher of "Dungeons & Dragons". Zork has also been adapted to a book series.
Three of the original "Zork" programmers joined with others to found Infocom in 1979. That company adapted "Zork" into "Zork I-III", a trilogy of games for most popular small computers of the era. Personal Software published what would become the first part of the trilogy under the name "Zork" when it was first released in 1980, but Infocom later handled the distribution of that game and their later games. Part of the reason for splitting Zork into three different games was that, at the time, micros did not have enough memory and disk storage to handle the entirety of the original game. In the process, more content was added to Zork to make each game stand on its own. A version of "Zork I" was issued as a hidden 'easter egg' in . It has exactly the same text and rules as the original.
"Zork" is set in "the ruins of an ancient empire lying far underground". The player is a nameless adventurer "who is venturing into this dangerous land in search of wealth and adventure". The goal is to return from the "Great Underground Empire" alive with the treasures, ultimately inheriting the title of Dungeon Master. The dungeons are stocked with many novel creatures, objects and locations, among them grues, zorkmids, and Flood Control Dam #3—all of which are referenced by subsequent Infocom text adventures. 
FrobozzCo International is a fictional monopoly from the game. FrobozzCo products are littered throughout all "Zork" games, often with humorous effect.
All these are text-only unless otherwise noted.
After a six year hiatus, the following games were produced:

Neusis construction

The neusis is a geometric construction method that was used by ancient Greek mathematicians. At that time, people did not have good rules to measure distances. They did not know algebra. So, they studied geometry by moving fixed length sticks around on a piece of paper.
The neusis construction (from Greek νεῦσις from νεύειν "neuein" "incline towards"; plural: νεύσεις "neuseis") fits a line element of given length ("a") in between two given lines ("l" and "m"), in such a way that the line element, or its extension, passes through a given point "P". That is, one end of the line element has to lie on "l", the other end on "m", while the line element is "inclined" towards "P".
A neusis construction might be performed by means of a 'Neusis Ruler': a marked ruler that is rotatable around the point "P" (this may be done by putting a pin into the point "P" and then pressing the ruler against the pin). In the figure, one end of the ruler is marked with a yellow eye with crosshairs: this is the origin of the scale division on the ruler. A second marking on the ruler (the blue eye) indicates the distance "a" from the origin. The yellow eye is moved along line "l", until the blue eye coincides with line "m". The position of the line element thus found is shown in the figure as a dark blue bar.
Point "P" is called the pole of the neusis, line "l" the directrix, or guiding line, and line "m" the catch line. Length "a" is called the "diastema" (διάστημα; Greek for "distance").
"Neuseis" have been important because they sometimes provide a means to solve geometric problems that are not solvable by means of compass and straightedge alone. Examples are the trisection of any angle in three equal parts, or the construction of a regular heptagon. Mathematicians such as Archimedes of Syracuse (287–212 BC) freely used "neuseis". Slowly, the Greeks stopped using it.
T. L. Heath, the historian of mathematics, thought that the Greek mathematician Oenopides (ca. 440 BC) was the first to put compass and straightedge constructions above "neuseis". Hippocrates of Chios (ca. 430 BC) may have spread the idea that mathematicians should avoid "neuseis" whenever possible. He came from the same island as Oenopides, and who was—as far as we know—the first to write a systematically ordered geometry textbook. One hundred years after him, Euclid also said bad things about "neuseis" in his very influential textbook, "The Elements".
The next attack on the neusis came when, from the fourth century BC, Plato's idealism gained ground. Under its influence, a hierarchy of three classes of geometrical constructions was developed. Descending from the "abstract and noble" to the "mechanical and earthly", the three groups were:
In the end, the Greek mathematicians thought that using a neusis was acceptable only when the two other, higher groups of constructions did not offer a solution. Neusis became a kind of last resort that was invoked only when all other, more respectable, methods had failed. Using neusis where other construction methods might have been used, was branded by the late Greek mathematician Pappus of Alexandria (ca. 325 AD) as "a not inconsiderable error".

Acute accent

The acute accent ( ´ ) is a mark in many written languages. It is usually added to the top a vowel to show how to say it. Acute accents are sometimes added to consonants too. Sometimes, the acute accent changes the sound of the whole word by giving it stress in a sentence. This accent is part of many modern languages that use Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek alphabets. The acute accent is one of many similar marks called diacritics.
The acute accent was first used in Ancient Greece. It told the speaker when to say a syllable with a high pitch. Another early accent mark was the apex. In Latin the apex marked long vowels.
The acute accent is mainly used to tell readers about the sound of vowels in words. Sometimes it is very important to the meaning because it shows the difference between two similar words. For example, "resume" may mean to start again, but "résumé" is a summary of someone's work and school experience. Some languages use the accent to show the same changes in sounds, but others use it differently. The acute accent may show:
Some languages use the accent to actually make new letters. Both Faroese and Icelandic add the acute accent to all of their vowels to make new letters. These letters, á, í, ó, ú and ý (plus é in Icelandic) are separate letters with different pronunciations. In Turkmen, the letter is a consonant: .
Many languages have borrowed words from French. Many Norwegian words which came from French keep an acute accent. Some examples are: "allé", "kafé", "idé", "komité". Swedish examples include "café" and "resumé" (noun). Examples in English include: "attaché", "canapé", "cliché", "communiqué", "café", "décor", "fiancé", "passé", "toupée" and "touché". However, sometimes writers forget or choose not to use the accent mark.
Some languages such as Arabic, Persian, or Japanese do not use alphabets. Some writers use the acute accent to tell how the words should sound when words from these languages are written in English. This is more common in older books and less common today.
The ISO-8859-1 and Windows-1252 character encodings included "á", "é", "í", "ó", "ú", "ý". They also had how letters and accents looked when they were written as capital letters. Unicode has many more letters with the acute accent.
To make an accented letter in a Microsoft Office software (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.), users hold the key and press the apostrophe key once. Then, let the key go, and press the letter they want.
On Apple Macintosh computers, users press "option-e" and then the vowel. Vowels can also be capitalised. For example, users make á by pressing "option-e" and then 'a'. Pressing "Option-e" and then "Shift-a" makes Á.
On Wikipedia, users make these symbols by clicking on a link in a box. Some other websites work the same way.

Sonitpur

Sonitpur is a major district of Assam, India.
The name "Sonitpur" as well as "Tezpur" literally means "the city of blood". 
It reminds of the romantic legend of Usha and Anirudha. The legend revolves around Banasura, the great Asura king of ancient Tezpur, his beautiful daughter Usha and her friend Chitralekha. The princess saw a handsome prince in her dreams and fell in love with him. Chitralekha, a talented artist, not only painted his portrait from Usha's description but recognised him to be Aniruddha, the grandson of Lord Krishna and ruler of Dwarka. Using her magical powers, Chitralekha spirited Aniruddha away to the princess' boudoir where the two married each other according to Gandharva rites, without the knowledge of the king. When Banasura learnt of the clandestine romance, he imprisoned Aniruddha, which led to the arrival of Lord Krishna to rescue his grandson. A fierce battle followed and the entire city was drenched in human blood, hence the name Sonitpur or Tezpur, i.e. ‘the city of blood’ . 
The story of eternal love between Usha and Aniruddha finds expression in many stories, novels, dramas, dance-dramas, movies.
Sir Edward A. Gait ( 1897) had made reference to the nine line inscription of Harjjar Varma in his ‘’A History of Assam.’’ The inscription is the first recorded history of Assam and dates back to 829 A.D. The inscription was found engraved on a massive
stone some two kms away from Tezpur town situated near a temple called Rudrapad.
Salastambha dynasty ruled Kamrupa from seventh to Tenth century A.D. The accurate boundary of their kingdom is debatable. But the erstwhile Darrang was certainly a part of the kingdom. They shifted their capital from Pragjyotishpur to Haruppeswara, or Hatappeswara- the present day Tezpur. The famous King of the dynasty Harjjar Varma, besides other things had excavated a large pond in 70 acres of land, later came to be known as Hajara Pukhuri ( Harjjara Pukhuri ).Pal dynasty ruled Haruppeswara till the 12th century. The most famous ruler of the Pal dynasty was Brahmapal.
After the Pal dynasty’’ the royal dominance of the Koch Kings in the west and the Ahoms in the east started growing. During the 14th and 15th century a large part of the western bank of Brahmaputra from Singri in the west and Sootea in the east was ruled by the Bara-Bhuyans. The great saint poet Sri Sri Shankardeva belonged to Bara-Bhuyan family, who settled at Rowta in Darrang District. The Ahom King Suhungmung alias Dihingia Raja occupied the territories of the Bara-Bhuyans on the north in 1505 A.D.The Koch King Biswa Sinha rose to power in 1515 A.D. King Naranarayana who ascended the thorne in about 1540 A. D. divided his Kingdom into two parts. He had given the eastern part to the son of his brother Chilarai and the western part of the kingdom to his own son Lakshminarayana. But soon after their ascension as kings, fatricidal war broke out and Lakshminarayana sought refuge with the Mughals which eventually led to invasion of Kamrup by the Mughals. Balinarayana, one of the brothers of Pariksitnarayana fled away to Gorgaon to seek the help of the Ahom king Swargadew Pratapsingha. Pratapsingha christened Balinarayana as Dharmanarayana, made him the king of Darrang and declared war against the Mughals (1616-1637 A.D.). The Ahoms defeated the mighty Mughals in the Bharali war and re-occupied Darrang from the Mughals. King Dharmanarayana made supreme sacrifice in Singari war in 1638. His son Sundarnarayana ascended the throne and became the king of Darrang.(excluding Tezpur). On the other hand, the Ahoms ruled the eastern part of Darrang ( present Sonitpur) through Kalia Bhomora Borphukan, stationed at Kaliabor. The Ahom Kings resettled many people in the southern part of Brahmaputra.
The British annexed the then Assam into the Indian British Empire in 1826. After1826 the Lower Assam and the Central Assam (Darrang, Nagaon and Raha) were made one division which extended up to Biswanath. The division was placed under one Administrative Officer designated as the Principal Assistant to the Commissioner. The Upper Assam portion was left to the native rulers with supervisory control under a British political agent with political headquarters at Biswanath. Captain Neufville was the political agent for Upper Assam. Darrang Division was administered till 1833 from Guwahati.
Darrang was converted into a district and Mangaldai was made the district Headquarter in 1833. But due to various reasons the British shifted the head quarter to Tezpur in 1835. The district comprised of two sub-divisions, Tezpur sadar sub-division and Mangaldoi sub-division with head quarter at Mangaldoi. The District of Darrang was divided in to six Revenue Circles under one Sub-Deputy Collector in each Circle. There was one Transferred area in the district at Charduar. An Asst. Political Officer was posted at Charduar under the Deputy Commissioner who acted as Political Officer.
Tezpur was a small township then. The British developed Tezpur as a small garrison township. Later, tea gardens were set-up throughout the district. The old steamarghat at Jahajghat, the Dak-Bungalow, the then Chummery compound at present Don-Bosco School campus, the Planters Club of Tezpur (Stations Club), the Jahajghat Railway Station, the Church of Ephiphany etc. and many tea gardens are some of the examples of the contributions of the British.
There is no specific information about the alignment of the people of the district in the earlier struggle for liberation waged by the princely and upper class people in Upper Assam from 1828 to 1857. But, with the spread of western education during the last part of the 19th century a new awakening surcharged the patriots of the land.
Few years before the birth of the Indian National Congress in Bombay in 1885, the Tezpur Ryot Sabha was formed by a group of enlightened people primarily to protest against the enhancement of land revenue and to ventilate other public grievances .
The Tezpur Ryot Sabha sent Kali Krishna Barkakoti to as its delegate to the National Congress in 1885. It had played an active role in early period of the freedom struggle.
The All Assam Student Association formed in 1916 worked in the district under the leadership of Chandra Nath Sarma.
In June, 1921, the Tezpur District Congress Committee was formed under the presidency of Chandra Nath Sarma.
In August 1921, Mahatma Gandhi visited Tezpur and recorded his impression of the visit in Young India in the article "From the Bank of Brahmaputra".
In 1934 Mahatma Gandhi visited Tezpur again during the course of Civil Disobedience Movement.
In the final phase of British Period the Quit India Movement gained momentum with the slogan "Do or Die" in places like Tezpur, Sootea, Gohpur, Dhekiajuli and Jamuguri.
On 10th September 1942, at Gohpur a young girl led a procession of unarmed villagers under Congress flag. She was Kanaklata Barua – a girl from Barangabari village. As soon as Kanaklata unfurled the flag she and her companion Mukunda Kakati were gunned down by the armed Police. The saga of her heroic sacrifice is still remembered with pride.
On the same day at Dhekiajuli Police Station eleven unarmed villagers were gunned down by the armed Police while trying to hoist the tri-color at the Police Station - three of them were teen-aged girls- Tileswari, Numali and Khahuli .
Finally, the British era had come to an end on 15th August "1947" when India gained her Independence in the midnight of 14th August.
The administration set up by the British continued even after Independence. Darrang district with head quarter at Tezpur continued as an important district of Assam. 
Towards 1961, Tezpur started to become a center of Trade and Commerce. A year later, in 1962, war broke out with China. The Chinese Army advanced up-to Sessa near Bhalukpung. People started fleeing from their homes. The war had left a bitter experience in the minds of the people of the district.
In 1983, Darrang district was bifurcated. Tezpur sadar sub-division was named as Sonitpur district with an outlying Sub-Division at Biswanath Chariali. Mangaldoi sub-division was named as Darrang district.
On 15th August, 2000, another Sub-Division namely Gohpur Sub-Division was carved out from the erstwhile Biswanath Sub-Division.
Two major events in the field of communication and education can be cited as landmarks in post-independence history of the district. The first one being the construction of Kalia Bhomora Bridge and its inauguration on 14th April,1987, by Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India. The second one is the establishment of a Central University at Napaam named as Tezpur University.
In the cultural front one can very well name the trio of Assamese culture who were born in the district. The post independence era had seen their talents flourishing which had not only enriched the cultural horizon of the district but has also contributed to formation of a composite Assamese culture.

Velvet Revolution

Velvet Revolution (Czech: Sametová revoluce, Slovak: Nežná revolúcia) is name for political changes in Czechoslovakia between November 17 and December 29, 1989. It ended with the fall of the one-party government of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and start of the democratization process. The name "Velvet" was chosen for its peaceful character.
After Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, censorship began again and the Communist Party expelled a lot of its members. This event during the 1970s is known as Normalization. Despite these events, the economic situation in Czechoslovakia was better than in other countries of Eastern Bloc (for example in Poland or Hungary).
The Velvet Revolution started at an official event for 50th anniversary of the closing of Czechoslovakian universities on November 17, 1939 by the Nazis in Prague. This event continued after its official end and was violently ended by state police on the street "Národní třída". In following days people organized meetings for protest against the actions of state police. 750-800 thousand people were at one of the biggest protests on November 25.
On November 19, the Civic Forum, the political movement which led the dialogue with the communist government, was created in The Drama Club in Prague. The same day, the movement "Public Against Violence" was created in Bratislava.
On November 27 a general strike took place. On this day there was a protest at Wenceslas Square with 300,000 people. Its main slogan was "Konec vlády jedné strany" - "End of one-part government".
Václav Havel was named as president of Czechoslovakia on December 29, 1989. He was the first non-communist president of Czechoslovakia since 1948.

Didcot power station

Didcot Power Station refers to a combined coal and oil power plant (Didcot A Power Station) and a natural-gas power plant (Didcot B Power Station) that supply the National Grid. They are right next to one another in the civil parish of Sutton Courtenay, next to the town of Didcot in Oxfordshire (formerly in Berkshire), in the UK. The combined power stations feature a chimney which is one of the taller structures in the United Kingdom, and six hyperbolic cooling towers, which can be seen from much of the surrounding area.
This was the first power station here. It is the biggest one with the big cooling towers (that make the cooling water cooler and make lots of steam) that are in two groups. One group is northwest, the other group is southeast. The power station can make up to 2000 megawatts (2000 million watts - an 'average' lightbulb uses only 50 or 60 watts) at any one time. Didcot 'A' mainly burns coal, but can also burn oil, or in some cases gas. This power station can use some biomass such as wood. The fuel (coal, oil and so on) is first ground up in big mills if it is solid (similar to old flour windmills, but powered by electric motors) to give it a large surface area, and is then blown into a large boiler with lots of air. Here it is burnt to make very high pressure steam, which is used to turn a large steam turbine. This turbine is connected to a generator, which makes the electricity that is then sent out on the National Grid.
This is the second power station in Didcot and is run only on gas. It can put out almost 1500 megawatts and uses gas turbines (like in an airplane) and steam turbines (like in the old power station) together to be more efficient. This is called combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT). It has smaller cooling towers that can't be seen as easily, but that make a more obvious cloud that appears to come from the ground.

Samgyetang

Samgyetang is Korean ginseng chicken soup. It’s a very healthy food during the summer, especially on the three days called ‘bok day’s.
Samgyetang is made of a whole young chicken stuffed with sticky rice, ginseng, jujube, garlic, and ginger. The chicken is “closed” shut and cooked in a soup. The richness of the broth depends on the style of the cook, as is the added ingredients that may be added. Some Samgyetang broths are cooked for hours. This broth is added to the chicken cooking separately to create a very rich soup. Other broths are lighter and clear. It’s a matter of preference.
Samgyetang is usually served with salt and pepper, which is put in a small separate dish to dip the meat. Some people like to add the seasoning directly into the soup. It is usually served with kkakdugi (radish kimchi) and some restaurants will offer regular kimchi as well.

Sesame oil

Sesame oil is a vegetable oil made from the sesame plant. It is used a lot in Asian cooking.
The English term sesame traces back to the Arabic "simsim", Coptic "semsem", and early Egyptian "semsent". "Semsent" was listed in the Ebers Papyrus, a 65-feet-long scroll listing ancient herbs and spices discovered by the famous German Egyptologist, Ebers. The earliest recorded use of a spice - sesame seed - comes from an Assyrian myth which claims that the gods drank sesame wine the night before they created the earth. Sesamum indicum, (indicum meaning "from India") is native to the East Indies. Usage dates back to 3000 B.C. Over 5,000 years ago, the Chinese burned sesame oil not only as a light source but also to make soot for their ink-blocks. African slaves brought sesame seeds, which they called benné seeds, to America, where they became a popular ingredient in southern dishes. Through the ages, the seeds have been a source of food and oil. Sesame seed oil is still the main source of fat used in cooking in the Near East and Far East.
Good sesame oil has a strong smell when it is opened. The color should be bright brown or gold. It should be kept at . If it is too cold, the oil would be solid and lose its smell. Sesame oil can go bad if it is exposed to air and sunlight. Therefore it is better kept on a shelf or a sideboard. A dark brown bottle is better than a plain one, because the brown one can protect the oil from the sunlight better. The bottle should be closed tightly to keep air out.
Many things affect the price. Oil content is the most important. Usually a bottle of sesame oil has 40~55%. The more oil content it has, the higher price it has. Another element is country of origin. Also if you buy it made from a factory it would cost less than oil made in a country house by a farmer.

Gristmill

A grist mill grinds grain into flour. Most old ones are watermills.
They have a waterwheel and 2 stones for grinding. Water pushes the wheel causing it to spin. This movement causes an axle inside to turn. The axle is connected to a gear which causes the grinding stones to spin. At the top, there is a chute filled with grain. The grain slowly falls through into the grinding stones.
Some old grist mills are windmills.

The Kiss (Klimt painting)

The painting The Kiss (original "Der Kuss") is the work painted by Gustav Klimt. He began to paint it in 1907 and it is one of the famous works in his 'Golden Period'. The Österreichische Galerie Belvedere museum, in the Belvedere palace, in Vienna, Austria is exhibiting the painting.
The painting shows a couple embracing each other with gold leaf on canvas. The man is kissing the woman, who has green hair. Klimt has said he had obsession for the woman with redheads, and it was reflected in the woman in his painting.
The man and woman are on a flowery grassland. According to the psychoanalytical and biological distinction, Klimt expressed them in different ways. The man wearing a robe with black, white and gray rectangles is described in a rough way, while the woman is expressed with the smooth figures such as a circle, a curve, and flowery patterns. Her hair is also combined with flowers; it looks like she is surrounded with flowers. On the contrary, the part outside the couple in the painting is filled with flat patterning which has small gleaming dots. 
"The Kiss" represents fin-de-siècle spirit because it shows a decadence through opulent and sybaritic images. Also, the painting has some styles recalling the arts of other period. Of them, by using gold leaf, the painting reflects medieval "gold-ground" paintings and earlier mosaics, and the spiral patterns in the clothes recall Bronze Age art.
In the Kiss, Klimt portrays woman as the femme fatale who is a beautiful woman attracting men sexually but brings them unhappiness. It is said that the woman modeled for the painting, however, his life companion Emilie Flöge,who participated as the Viennese bohemian (Bohemianism) and fin-de-siecle circles like Klimt.

Appendage

Appendages are parts of animals attached the main body. Many arthropods have appendages on each, or most, of their segments. Millipedes, for example, have many segments, and almost all carry two legs. Insects have exactly six legs, two on each segment of the thorax. Antennae (feelers) attached to their heads are another type of appendage.
Wings, parts of the tail, legs, some mouthparts, external sex organs can all be described as appendages.
Appendages may be uniramous, as in insects and centipedes, where each appendage comprises a single series of segments, or it may be biramous, as in many crustaceans, where each appendage branches into two sections. 
All arthropod appendages are variations of the same basic structure (homologous). Which structure is produced is controlled by homeobox genes. Changes to these genes have allowed scientists to produce animals (such as "Drosophila melanogaster") with modified appendages, such as legs instead of antennae.

Terraria is an action-adventure/RPG indie game released by independent game studio "Re-Logic" on May 16, 2011. It was originally available on Microsoft Windows, but different ports are available on the Xbox Live, Playstation, Android, iOS, and Windows Phone. It is a 2D side-scrolling format, similar to Mario or Mega Man.
It is a wide-open sandbox style game; players may edit the terrain and go anywhere they want to.
There are a wide variety of materials (Called "blocks" or "tiles") that players can use, such as Dirt Blocks, Stone Blocks, Copper Ore, Wood, and many more. Players need the right tools to mine any block. The game begins with the player creating a custom character, and then is placed in a computer-generated world. The players begins with only a few Copper tools, which are used to gather wood, mine blocks, and attack monsters. From these basic Copper tools, the player moves up to stronger armor and weapons. There are bosses in Terraria that the player must defeat. Terraria is much like Minecraft, but it is only two dimensional and includes many more items and bosses.
In Terraria, the music changes depending on which biome/area the player is in.

List of political parties in Azerbaijan

This is a list of political parties in Azerbaijan.
Azerbaijan is a one-party dominant state, meaning that is a system of majority rule where one political party, in this case the ruling New Azerbaijan Party, has successively won election victories by a very large majority and is therefore the dominant ruling party, which does not have to form coalitions (alliances) with other smaller political parties as a result. The one party dominant state differs from a one-party state, because opposition parties against the New Azerbaijan Party are allowed, but are widely considered to have no real chance of gaining power.

The one-party dominant state differs from a one-party state, because opposition parties against the dominant ruling party are allowed, but have no real chance of gaining power. 
Many one-party dominant states are dictatorships where only one party can by law be in control, but some one-party dominant states are real democracies, where there are no limits by law against other parties.
A case of this was Mexico, where Presidential candidates (person running for this governmental office) of the Institutional Revolutionary Party were popularly elected for more than 70 years.

Kenneth G. Wilson

Kenneth Geddes Wilson (June 8, 1936 – June 15, 2013) was an American theoretical physicist and Nobel Prize winner.
As an undergraduate at Harvard, he was a Putnam Fellow. He earned his PhD from Caltech in 1961, studying under Murray Gell-Mann. 
He became a junior faculty member in Cornell University Physics Department in 1963. He became a full professor in 1970. In 1974, he became the James A. Weeks Professor of Physics at Cornell. He was a co-winner of the Wolf Prize in physics in 1980, together with Michael E. Fisher and Leo Kadanoff. He got the 1982 Nobel Prize in Physics for combining quantum field theory and the statistical theory of critical phenomena of second-order phase transitions. In other words the prize was for his constructive theory of the renormalization group. In this theory he gave not only important, and even numerical, insights to the field of critical statics and dynamics in statistical physics, but indirectly also basic answers to the question: "What is quantum field theory?" and "What does renormalization mean?". He also gave a constructive answer to another important "renormalization" problem from solid-state physics, the Kondo effect.
He advocated that the federal government should buy supercomputers for science research. In 1985, he was appointed as Cornell's Director of the Center for Theory and Simulation in Science and Engineering (known now as the Cornell Theory Center, one of five national supercomputer center created by the National Science Foundation. Since 1988, Dr. Wilson has been a faculty member at The Ohio State University. His current research interests include physics education research.
Some of his PhD students include Roman Jackiw, Steve Shenker, and Michael Peskin.
Wilson's father was the prominent chemist E. Bright Wilson, and his brother David is also a Professor at Cornell in the department of Molecular Biology and Genetics.
Wilson died on June 19, 2013 from lymphoma in Saco, Maine, aged 77.

<doc id="317823" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317823" title="Apex (diacritic)">
Apex (diacritic)

In written Latin, the apex (plural: "apices") is a diacritic. It is close to the shape of an acute accent ( ´ ). The apex is used to show that a vowel is long and not short. That means that the vowel is pronounced for longer.
The shape and length of the apex can be different. It can even sometimes be different within the same writing. While pretty much all apices are made up of a line sloping up to the right, the line can be more or less curved, and is different in length from less than half the height of a letter to more than the height of a letter. Sometimes, it is put at the top with a hook, pointing out to the left. Rather than being centered over the vowel it changes, the apex is often drawn to the right.
Later, it developed into the acute accent, which is still used in some languages to mark vowel length. In particular, Czech and Slovak, Hungarian, Irish, and (a long time ago) Icelandic.
Although not really known by some modern Latinists, the sign was actually used a lot during classical and postclassical times. The reason why it is not usually noticed is probably because of its smallish size and the fact that it is usually quite thin. People who look carefully will soon start to notice apices in the exhibits of any museum, not only in many of the more formal epigraphic writings, but also in handwritten palaeographic things.
Forgetting the apex, modern Latin spelling has recently started marking long vowels by using the macron. The macron is a sign that had always been used, and still is, to mark metrically long "syllables" (more recently called "heavy" syllables). This has caused confusion between syllable and vowel length in Latin, and most western dictionaries still cannot describe the nature of Latin vowels properly because of this. To make even more confusion, the acute accent is sometimes used in Latin to mark stressed syllables, just like in Spanish, when the macron is not used.
The apex is often thought to be the opposite of another ancient Latin diacritic, the sicilicus, which is said to have been used above "consonants" to show that they should be pronounced as doubles. However, in his article "Apex and Sicilicus", Revilo P. Oliver says that they are the same sign, a "geminationis nota". This was used over any letter to show that the letter should be read twice. 
If Revilo P. Oliver is right, the apex as a sign showing vowel length would have been made in the time when long vowels were written double. Then, when long vowels were not regularly written twice. 
However, Oliver's view that the two marks were the same has recently been challenged.

Differential geometry

Differential geometry is a field of mathematics. It uses differential and integral calculus as well as linear algebra to study problems of geometry. The theory of the plane, as well as curves and surfaces in Euclidean space are the basis of this study. Big discoveries were made in the 18th and 19th century. In geometry, the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. Carl Friedrich Gauß wondered whether triangle bearings of ships really has a sum of angles of exactly 180 degrees; with this question he was among the pioneers of modern differential geometry.
A long time ago, differential geometry was used for map projections. Today, it is used for fields as diverse as general relativity theory, or satellite navigation. Grigori Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture uses differential geometry.

The headquarters of the party is in the capital city Baku.
The party's stated ideologies are lawfulness, secularism, and Azerbaijani nationalism. It wants to build a "social-oriented" economy, meaning a middle path between socialism and "laissez-faire" capitalism (a mixed economy), and lists civil solidarity and social justice as the basis of its ideology.

Hanok

Hanok is a type of house. It is built in a traditional Korean style of architecture.
The main feature of Hanok is that it has combination of ondol, the Korean under-floor heating system, and wooden floor for heating and cooling. This style is mainly used in Korea because of problems caused by the area having both a continental climate and an oceanic climate.
Hanoks have different shapes in different parts of Korea. In the northern part of the Korean peninsula, Hanok have the structure of a house with several wings. The wings are often built in either a square or the letter L. This helps keep the wind out of the house in the colder northern places and helps keep the house warm. These kind of house also has low roofs. In the warmer southern Korean peninsula, Hanok have a single wing and a wooden floor. This helps let the air in and out.
The Hanok is also different based on the class of the people who live it. Hanok of Upper class people usually have tiled roofs (called "giwa") while lower class houses have roofs made of rice-straw (called "choga"). Hanok for the upper-class people are built not only to be homes, but also to be very ornamental.

A cappella

A cappella music is music where people sing without instruments.
In a choir, there are up to 5 parts: soprano, alto, tenor, baritone, and bass. A cappella can also have those 5 parts. A difference is with percussion. With musical instruments, percussion is done with musical instruments that you hit, such as drums. In an a cappella performance, a person makes the percussion sound. For a beatbox performance, performers make sounds like electric drums, synthesizer and electric guitar. Another part of percussion in a cappella performance is making classical drum sounds for tapping the beat.
The word a cappella is Italian for "in the manner of the church" or "in the manner of the chapel". It was first used in religious music. Gregorian chant is an example of a cappella singing.
For the first 1000 years of Christianity, all hymns in the church were sung without instrumental accompaniment. This style of singing came to be known as a cappella, meaning "of the church" or "in the style of the church".
There are several kinds of music in a cappella, such as barbershop, classical, contemporary, gospel, doo-wop, jazz, and world.
A barbershop group has 4 people. The name of this genre came from the tradition that when many men gathered in a barbershop they would sing with no musical instruments. A barbershop quartet has four male voices or four female voices. Mixed barbershop quartets are also possible, usually with two male and two female voices. The voices parts are called bass, baritone, lead, and tenor. In music in the barbershop style, the melody (the "tune") is sung by the lead part.
In classical a cappella, people perform classical music such as 'a Turkish march', 'Overture William Tell', madrigal, etc.
Contemporary is the most popular kind of a cappella these days. For this kind, the "bass" line should be stronger, and the "chorus" (all the singers except for bass, percussion, and solo) should have variety. The percussion should make their sound more like drums. This genre is similar to 'doo-wop' but the "chorus" part is more complex and has a variety of sound effects.
Doo-wop is also getting more popular because of its simple style. Even though it has simple moto (Italian for "progression of music"), it can be interesting with great vocal and chorus.

Spanking

Spanking is hitting the buttocks of another person to cause them pain. Spanking normally means hitting the buttocks of another person with an open hand. Parents in some countries spank children and teenagers to punish them. In some other countries this is no longer allowed. Parents often hope that spanking will make the children obey them. From the past up to the present day, adults have spanked boys more than they have spanked girls.
When a parent spanks their child, they usually strike the child's buttocks with their open hand. Sometimes they use other objects such as a belt or a wooden spoon. At times the child's buttocks may be clothed. At other times they may be bare. Often the parent makes the child lie across their lap. At other times, a parent might tell a child or teenager to bend over or lie face down across a bed.
When children are asked how they feel when their parents spank them, many say that it makes them feel sad, angry, and afraid. Some young children in the United Kingdom whose parents spanked them said things like, "“it feels like someone banged you with a hammer”" and "“it hurts and it’s painful inside – it’s like breaking your bones”". 
The American Academy of Pediatrics is a group of medical doctors who work with children. They say that spanking is not a good way to help children learn how to behave.  They say that it can easily injure a small child. They say that spanking can lead to child abuse. They say that parents should never spank a child with an object.
Some groups of people have said that spanking is violent and goes against human rights. They are people like lawyers, social workers, and politicians. Spanking a person under the age of 18 is now against the law in more than 40 countries. Some of those countries are Brazil, Germany, Israel, Argentina, Sweden, Netherlands, Spain, Poland, New Zealand, Kenya, and Costa Rica.
Dr. Elizabeth T. Gershoff is a scientist who studies spanking. She says that research done over many years shows that spanking does not work. She says that spanking does not teach children good behavior or to obey their parents. She says that children who are spanked obey their parents less as time goes on. Dr. Gershoff said that spanking is "violent" and should be stopped. In 2012, a group of Canadian scientists also looked at many years of research and found that spanking does not work. They said that over time, spanked children become more aggressive. Murray Straus is another scientist studying spanking of children. He has said that there is new research showing that spanked children commit more crimes when they grow up. He said that this was so even if their parents were "loving" to them.
A small number of scientists have claimed that ordinary spanking does no harm. Other scientists say that "over 100" studies have shown that spanking can harm children. They say that spanking harms children's mental growth. They also say that children who are spanked grow up to have more mental illnesses. They say that no study has shown any good to come from spanking. Scientists at the University of Manitoba in Canada found that children who were hit even "sometimes" suffered more mental illnesses when they grew up. They could have different kinds of mental illnesses: long-lasting sad or discouraged feelings and a loss of pleasure and interest in life (depression), a lot of fear and worry (anxiety), racing thoughts that are hard to control and acting without thinking (mania), or a need to take drugs or alcohol to feel well (drug and alcohol abuse). Other scientists have discovered that spanking children often can make their brains grow less than they should. These children end up less able to think clearly. They also try to hurt others more.

Green chemistry

Green chemistry (also called sustainable chemistry) is a type of chemical research and engineering. It supports the design of products and processes that use as little dangerous substances as they can. Environmental chemistry is the chemistry of the natural environment and of pollutant chemicals in nature. But green chemistry wants to reduce and prevent pollution at its source. In 1990, the Pollution Prevention Act was passed in the United States. This law sought original and new ways to handle pollution. It aims to avoid problems before they happen.
Green chemistry applies organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, analytical chemistry and even physical chemistry. While green chemistry seems to focus on just industrial applications, it does apply to any chemistry choice. Click chemistry is often said to be a style of chemical synthesis that has the same aim as green chemistry. Green chemists reduce the hazards and increase the efficiency of any chemical choice. It is distinct from environmental chemistry which focuses on chemical phenomena in the environment.
1. Prevent waste
Create products without or with minimal wastes so that the wastes do not need to be taken care of afterwards.
2. Design safer chemicals and products
Design chemicals to have little or no toxicity, without affecting effectiveness.
3. Design less hazardous chemical syntheses
Design a way of synthesising products without it being toxic to humans or the environment.
4. Use renewable raw materials
Use renewable raw materials, like plant materials, other than depleting ones, such as Fossil fuels.
5. Use catalysts, not stiochiometric reagents
Use of catalysts because of their ability to be able to be reused and that they are less harmful than reagents.
6. Avoid chemical derivatives
Chemical derivatives generate wastes that can be avoided.
7. Maximize atom economy
Make sure that a greater percentage of the atoms present in the reactants of a chemical reaction are used in the products that are also usable.
8. Use safer solvents and reaction conditions
Avoid using harsh solvents, but if that cannot be avoided, then use benign chemicals.
9. Increase energy efficiency
Use the normal ambient temperature and pressure wherever possible.
10. Design for degradation
Design materials to breakdown into benign substances by bacterial or other environmentally sound ways.
11. Analyse in real time to prevent pollution
Monitor and control the formation of by-products during a reaction.
12. Minimize the potential for accidents
Design chemicals to minimize the potential for accidents.

Memristor

A memristor, or memory resistor, is described as one of the basic elements (resistor, capacitor, inductor) of electronic circuits, because it can’t be replaced by any combination of these elements. This element can change its resistivity according to the voltage, but even after disconnection it remembers resistivity for unlimited time. It can work like analog memory or a resistive switch, which can have an infinite number of states.
Professor Leon Chua mathematically described this element in 1971.
In 2008 scientists from HP labs described a material that appeared to be a good candidate to construct the hypothetical memristor.
The fourth element can change its conductivity by the voltage, and after power interruption the amount of the resistivity stays the same. No combination of the other three circuit elements can replace a memristor. Only the memristor allows reconfiguring properties so it allows changing a whole electronic circuit. Analogy behaviour is similar to synapses in the brain.
Memristors have great potential for use in computers. For example, computers today have to boot from hard drives because the data is erased from operating memory immediately after shutting down the computer. The process of booting takes much time and energy. Memristors could be used for loading data quicker because it remembers data even after power interruption. Therefore, Memristors could be used to speed the booting process.
The first products using Memristor technology are expected to become available in 2013.

Geostationary orbit

A geostationary orbit (or Geostationary Earth Orbit - GEO) is a type of geosynchronous orbit directly above the Earth's equator (0° latitude). Like all geosynchronous orbits, it has a period (time for one orbit) that is 24 hours. This means it goes around the Earth as fast as the Earth spins, and so it appears to stay above the same spot all the time. A person watching from Earth sees a satellite in a geostationary orbit as not moving, at a steady place in the sky. 
Communications satellites and weather satellites often use these orbits, so that the satellite antennas that communicate with them do not have to move to track them. The ground atennas can be pointed permanently at a fixed position in the sky. This is cheaper and easier than having a satellite dish that is always moving to track a satellite. Each one stays above the equator at a set longitude (distance east or west).
The idea of a geosynchronous satellite for communication was first published in 1928 (but not widely so) by Herman Potočnik. The idea of a geostationary orbit became well known first in a 1945 paper called "Extra-Terrestrial Relays — Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?" by the British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, published in "Wireless World" magazine. The orbit, which Clarke first described as good for broadcast and relay communications satellites, is sometimes called the Clarke Orbit. Named after the author, the Clarke Belt is this part of space above the Earth - about above sea level, over the equator, where near-geostationary orbits may be implemented. The Clarke Orbit (another name for a geostationary orbit) is about around.
The satellite orbits in the direction of the Earth's rotation, producing an orbital period equal to the Earth's period of rotation, known as the sidereal day (very nearly 24 hours).
The orbit needs to be above the equator. Since all orbits are around the center of the Earth, if it was tipped above the equator (so that the satellite was straight above New York City, for example) it would need to swing an equal distance to the south pole on each orbit. It needs to spend an equal amount of time on each side of the equator. So if it is directly above the equator, it doesn't move north or south at all. (Geosynchronous orbits are like geostationary orbits, but also include those that go above and below the equator).
The height of the orbit is an exact distance, because the speed of the orbit depends on how far it is from the center of the Earth. An orbit is a balance between centripetal force against the Earth's gravity. Objects closer to Earth feel more gravity. So objects in low orbit (like the International Space Station or GPS satellites) go faster, and orbit the Earth very quickly, about 90 minutes or so for each orbit. Objects farther away take longer for each orbit. The moon for instance, takes about 29 days for each orbit.
Because this orbit is so high, it takes radio (and light) waves about 1/4 second to go up to the satellite and back to Earth. This means that a TV interview taking place between the office in one place, and reporter in a different country can have a gap of a half second (1/4 second to go from the office to the reporter, and a 1/4 second back to the office, where the signal is then sent to viewer). This half second delay can be noticed in many news broadcasts.
Also, when satellites reach the end of their life, it would be too expensive to bring them all the way back down to Earth to burn up in the atmosphere. It is much cheaper to put them a little higher (300 km) in a 'graveyard' orbit, where they will stay essentially forever.

Weevil

Weevils are herbivorous beetles. They have a long 'snout' at the front of their head, called a "rostrum". Weevils are a family, the Curculionidae, which may be the largest beetle family, with about 45,000+ named living species. That makes it the largest family in the animal kingdom. In addition, the superfamily Curculionoidea has ten more families of closely related weevil-type beetles.
The family has some pests which damage plants of interest to humans. The most famous weevil is the boll weevil, which ruins cotton crops.
The "Ips" genus, feeding on Ponderosa pine, introduces a fungus to the tree. The fungus blocks resin canals, which leaves the weevil free to eat. Resin would normally wash the insects out; it is a defence mechanism. The fungus often kills the tree, and groups of dead trees are a focus for forest fires. In this way the insect is indirectly responsible for serious fires.
The maize weevil, "Sitophilus zeamais", is a major pest. It attacks both standing crops and stored cereal products, including wheat, rice, sorghum, oats, barley, rye, buckwheat, peas, and cottonseed.

4D meaning four dimensions is an important idea in geometry. Three-dimension space (3D) has length, depth and height. The fourth dimension is in relation to that three dimensions like a vertical dimension.
In some branches of physics time is considered as a fourth dimension but in real time people are not allowed to perceive it and it is used for modeling physical and social causes.
In mathematics, four-dimension space is an abstract concept which has been studied by mathematics and philosophers for almost three hundred years.
Mathematicians who studied four-dimension space include Möbius, Schläfi, Bernard Riemann, and Charles Howard Hinton.
In the twentieth century the idea of spacetime was developed. It connects space and time. The difference is that spacetime is not a Euclidean space but it is called "Minkowski continuum". The four-dimension space was mostly studied in the nineteenth century.

Profiling

Profiling is collecting information about someone in order to describe them and/or predict their behaviour and actions. It is often used for criminals or people believed to behaving illegally. More recently used on employees in the work place to improve success
A basic profile consists of an all points bulletin (APB). It is a visual description based on eyewitness information. 
A psychological profile is created in the absence of eyewitness information, or in addition to, using evidence to create a picture of the suspect and help the police force to understand how the suspect is behaving.
Predictive profiling attempts to predict which people might commit crimes in the future.
Criminal profiling – criminal profiling is a tool used by police forces to create a picture or idea of a suspect based on eyewitness information and any other evidence they have.
Some people fear profiling is taken too far by police forces and can lead to harassment and arrest based on skin colour, religious beliefs, culture, nation of origin, or any social type or group that can be stereotyped by characteristic behaviour. 
Behavioural profiling is used in business to help recruit the right person for a job, to understand how to improve morale and to drive down staff turnover, pinpoint who is ready for development and in precisely which areas; and boost people management abilities.

<doc id="317905" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317905" title="Kula">
Kula

Kula is a traditional trade method that takes place in the Milne Bay Province of Papua New Guinea.
The Kula Exchange takes place on eighteen islands, including the Trobriand Islands, and involves thousands of people. The traders involved travel by canoe over hundreds of miles to exchange their Kula valuables. These valuables can be in the form of red shells that are traded to the North of the Islands, or in the form of white-shell armbands, which travel to the South of the Islands. Therefore creating a ‘ring’ of moving valuables throughout the islands. The terms of trade change in different regions. For example, some traders have to exchange a white armband for a necklace or must trade a red shell for a white shell armband. There are also differences on who can take part in the trading process such as in the Trobriand Islands their chiefs mainly take part in the exchange process, whereas in Dobu, anyone can take part. 
The Kula valuables are mainly traded for social status and recognition in the Island region. The people that an individual trades with become trusted trade partners, creating a strong, potentially life-long relationship between the exchange parties. These relationships need trust to be provided on both sides of the trade and also a mutual agreement of safety and support for each other. 
Kula valuables are usually passed on to their trade partners after a certain amount of time, therefore the valuables are always moving around the Kula Ring. The person who originally owned the valuable has full ownership and rights over the item, so he can keep it, sell it or even break it. Every person who therefore receives the item, does not fully own it, as there is always a true owner. This creates a sense of responsibility over how the object is handled by other traders toward the original owner. However, the original owner is sometimes unknown, lost in the Kula Ring.
The ability to take part in the Kula Exchange is not immediately given to just anyone. An individual must “buy” into the system by getting involved in lower trade circles than the Kula. 
The Kula valuables are rated by value and age and so are the relationships created through their exchange. Traders will often try to collect valuable and notorious Kula objects that will boost the status of the trader’s name in the Kula Ring. Kula Exchange is based on trust, strong social obligations and the cultural value system. Those who hold on too long to their Kula valuables gain a bad reputation in the system.
The Kula Exchange system determines many social hierarchies and authoritative positions among the trade islands. For example the chiefs living on the Trobriand Islands in the 1970s owned the most shells and also the most valuable shells. Therefore they were responsible for most of the organization and direction of the trade systems in their region. (The Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea (1988) by Annette B. Weiner) Also, the ten most influential men among all the islands control about 90 per cent of the Kula items. With this amount of control and competition, relationships between traders become fragile and ruined by manipulation and deceit. (Malinowski, B. (1920). "Kula; the Circulating Exchange of Valuables in the Archipelagoes of Eastern New Guinea". Man (Man, Vol. 20) 20: 97–105).

A fa’afafine is a boy who is raised as a girl all the way through adulthood. Historically, this has been classified as a third gender in the tradition of Samoan society.
This usually occurs when there are too many sons and not enough daughters in a family. They identify themselves as females in a male’s body. People from societies that do not recognize a third gender may mistake them for being either homosexual or transsexual.
They take on the role of both male and female in the society e.g. teaching, construction and also domestic work. They tend to have sexual intercourse with both sexes, however rarely with another fa’afafine.

Maslenitsa

Maslenitsa is one of the most popular and cheerful religious holidays in Russia. It originated from pagan times before Russia was converted to Christianity. At first, this holiday was a symbol of the spring solstice but nowadays it is considered a Christian holiday which goes right before the Great Lent. During Maslenitsa people enjoy almost any food, except meat. Usually Maslenitsa lasts for seven days and on the last day of this holiday people burn a doll which is made of branches and straw and dressed in bright clothes. This doll is called “Maslenitsa” and it symbolizes the cold and severe winter. By burning “Maslenitsa” people say goodbye to winter and greet a warm spring.
Every day of Maslenitsa plays a great role. On Monday people greet the holiday with games such as sledding, snowballs, riding on swings and so on. Russian people believe that happiness and joy which they feel during this day will accompany them throughout a year. On Tuesday people play games and bake pancakes which are called "blini". Blini are the most popular food which is made during this holiday. These pancakes have a round form and symbolize the Sun and warmth. On Wednesday people usually visit their friends and relatives and treat each other with blini. On Thursday by tradition people try to drive away winter by riding on horses around the village or around the places they live. Friday is usually called “Mothers’-in-law evenings” because sons-in-law come to visit their mothers-in-law. On merry Saturday everyone goes to visit their relatives. All people drink and eat as much as they want and play different games. Sunday is the last day of the holiday. It is also called the "Sunday of forgiveness" because on this day everyone asks forgiveness from relatives and friends for offences and mistakes committed against them. The most appropriate answer is “God will forgive”. After that people usually sing songs, dance and at the end of the day they burn the doll.
Maslenitsa is also considered as a family holiday because spring is a symbol of new life. People who marry during this time are considered as very strong and happy couples who will give a birth to many children. During Maslenitsa some people even “punish” those who did not marry yet by throwing them into snow.

In the 1960s Paul Jones and Tom McGuinness played for Manfred Mann. Jones worked also as actor and radio DJ.As a harmonica man, he has performed publicly and/or recorded with Memphis Slim, Alexis Korner, Henry Gray, Alvin "Youngblood" Hart, Susan Tedeschi, Eric Bibb and Otis Grand. Hughie Flint was the drummer of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Together with McGuinness he later formed McGuiness Flint who had a hit with "When I´m dead and gone". Dave Kelly was guitarist in the John Dummer Blues Band and in the touring bands of Howlin' Wolf and John Lee Hooker. They played together mostly in London pubs just for fun about playing rhythm ´n blues. 
Their first album "The Official Blues Band Bootleg Album" raised no interest with record labels, so they sold it during concerts and via mail order. The record was a fine mixture of blues standards and own songs. Arista signed with the band and the album reached #40 in the charts. 1982 Hughie Flint left the band and was replaced by Rob Townsend. In 1983 they parted but they came together soon. 
When not playing with the Blues Band Jones, McGuinness and Townsend are playing with "The Manfreds". The band can be seen as the 1960s Manfred Mann Band without the leader. Dave Kelly plays often with his "The Dave Kelly Band".
By playing a lot of concerts all over Europe they had and still have a lot of fans. Till present they recorded over 20 albums. It is said, that three generations of a family can be seen in their concerts.

In medicine, an acute disease or condition either happens for a short time, as in acute infection, or doesn't last long. The word acute may often be confused by the general public to mean 'severe'. This is different: something can be acute but not severe.
The word "acute" is in the name of many diseases, for example, severe acute respiratory syndrome or acute leukemia.
Acute hospitals are hospitals which are meant for short-term medical and/or surgical treatment and care. The related medical speciality is called acute medicine. 
Subacute is described as between acute and chronic. An example is subacute fever symptoms or subacute endocarditis.

<doc id="317940" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317940" title="Toxicity">
Toxicity

Toxicity is the degree to which a substance can damage an organism. It is the subject-matter of toxicology.
A central idea in toxicology is that almost everything is toxic when taken to excess. Effects are dose-dependent: even water can lead to 'water intoxication' when taken in too much. For even a very toxic substance such as elapid snake venom there is a dose below which there is no toxic effect. 
Toxicity is species-specific. A dose which is toxic to one animal may not be toxic to another.
Acute toxicity describes the bad effects of a substance that come either from a single exposure, or from many exposures in a short amount of time (usually less than 24 hours). To be known as "acute" toxicity, the bad effects should happen within 14 days of the substance thouching something.
Acute toxicity is different from chronic toxicity. Chronic toxicity talks about the bad health effects from many exposures, often at lower levels, to a substance over a longer amount of time (months or years).
It is widely thought to be wrong to use humans as tests for acute (or chronic) toxicity research. However, some information can be picked up from investigating cases when humans accidentally make contact with the substance (e.g., factory accidents). Otherwise, most acute toxicity data comes from animal testing or, more recently, "in vitro" testing methods and inference from data on similar substances.

Pygmalion

Pygmalion is a play by George Bernard Shaw.
A street girl selling flowers, Eliza, meets Professor Higgins. Higgins was writing down her pronunciation for his study, but Eliza misunderstood him as a policeman and caused trouble. Higgins says he can make her a duchess. It was changing her pronunciation. Later she remembers what he said and goes to learn pronunciation with a desire to be an upper class woman. 
Higgins decides to do an experiment with her. He deceives all the people at a party. It was making them believe that she is a duchess. After this success, Higgins suggests two options for Eliza. One is marrying based on her beauty. The other is running a flower shop with money from Colonel Pickering who is a rich man. Eliza refuses to do both of them and she leaves his home. Higgins and Colonel Pickering look for Eliza as soon as they know that she left. They find her in Mrs. Higgins’ house but Eliza refuses to go back. She says she would marry Freddy.
George Bernard Shaw is famous for giving audiences a twist by not doing what they expect. In comedy, people expect someone in a bad situation to be in a better one at the end. They expect a poor person to marry a rich man. They expect a villain to be punished. In "Pygmalion", the flower girl in the bad situation gets better in the end. This girl selling flowers on the street rises to the upper class. It was through changing her language.
However, contrary to the audience's expectation, romance between flower girl and Professor Higgins doesn’t happen. She doesn’t marry a rich man. Also, George Bernard Shaw reflected his beliefs to reform the society in this play. 
In the 20th century, there were many poor people on the street. Especially little girls worked all day for a tiny amount of money. The author had much interest in poor people and women’s freedom. And he believed speech was one of the things that separated rich and poor people. That is the starting point of "Pygmalion". He used the change of language as a means to rise to the upper class.
In mythology, Pygmalion was a sculptor who did not like women. He could not find a woman to love. And he decided to make a statue, Galatea. In the play, Pygmalion is compared to Professor Higgins. And Galatea is compared to Eliza. Pygmalion made Galatea to be his ideal woman. And Professor Higgins changed Eliza into a perfect upper class woman. He taught her everything from how to talk to how to behave in front of people. This process of making Eliza an upper class woman is criticized as playing with a live doll, as though she didn’t have her own soul. Higgins treats her as an object.
Also, the common expectation of audiences that women’s fate is determined by men is criticized. It is because of Eliza’s reaction after the success of pretending to be a duchess. She thought the two options suggested by Higgins would be selling herself. 
When she was selling flowers, at least she didn’t have to sell herself. She doesn’t want to rely on a rich man, but decides to marry a poor man, Freddy. She says she can make something of him. She values love more than anything else.

Mosaic (genetics)

In genetics, a mosaic (or mosaicism) means the presence of two different genotypes in an individual which developed from a single fertilized egg. As a result, the individual has two or more genetically different cell lines derived from a single zygote. 
Mosaicism may result from:
The phenomenon was discovered by Curt Stern. In 1936, he demonstrated that recombination, normal in meiosis, can also take place in mitosis. When it does, it results in somatic (body) mosaics. These are organisms which contain two or more genetically distinct types of tissue.
A genetic chimera is an organism composed of two or more sets of genetically distinct cells. Dispermic chimeras happen when two fertilized eggs fuse together. Mosaics are a different kind of chimerism: they originate from a single fertilized egg.
This is easiest to see with eye colours. When eye colours vary between the two eyes, or within one or both eyes, the condition is called "heterochromia iridis" (= 'different coloured iris'). It can have many different causes, both genetic and accidental. For example, David Bowie had the appearance of different eye colours due to an injury that caused one pupil to be permanently dilated.
On this page, only genetic mosaicism is discussed.
The most common cause of mosaicism in mammalian females is X-inactivation. Females have two X chromosomes (and males have only one). The two X chromosomes in a female are rarely identical. They have the same genes, but at some loci (positions) they may have different alleles (versions of the same gene).
In the early embryo, each cell independently and randomly inactivates one copy of the X chromosome. This inactivation lasts the lifetime of the cell, and all the descendants of the cell inactivate that same chromosome. 
This phenomenon shows in the colouration of calico cats and tortoiseshell cats. These females are heterozygous for the X-linked colour genes: the genes for their coat colours are carried on the X chromosome. X-inactivation causes groups of cells to carry either one or the other X-chromosome in an active state.
X-inactivation is reversed in the female germline, so that all egg cells contain an active X chromosome.
"Mosaicism" refers to differences in the genotype of various cell populations in the same individual, but X-inactivation is an epigenetic change, a switching off of genes on one chromosome. It is "not" a change in the genotype. Descendent cells of the embryo carry the same X-inactivation as the original cells. This may give rise to mild symptoms in female 'carriers' of X-linked genetic disorders.

Anti-fan

Anti-fans are the group of people who are opposed to particular person, system, or idea. This word is from a prefix 'anti-', which means 'opposed'. Anti-fans gather and criticize particular thing which they hate.
Anti-fans' activities are very diverse. Anti-fans usually work and share their views in online website. They make anti-fan page. E.g. anti-fan website, anti-fan blog, anti-fan internet cafe etc. And, they criticise their target, spread a rumor about the target, and post malicious comments to Internet articles. Anti-fans also work when they are offline. They sometimes boo and jeer at their target and even start a movement against the target. 
Early their activities used to be constructive criticism, but nowadays the movement of anti-fans is changing to severe insult to their target with no specific reason. The ruthless attack causes a lot of social problems now. A lot of celebrities who are the anti-fans' target are suffering from their behaviors. In some case, they may accuse anti-fans of personal insults. 
Anti-fans' targets are various. The most usual target is entertainer. There are a lot of anti-fans' website for the entertainer who they dislike. E.g. Some anti-fans oppose a form of music, movie, athlete, politician, political party, TV series, idea etc. Surprisingly, the number of anti-fans tends to be proportional to the target's popularity. Thus, the number sometimes becomes a yardstick of star's popularity.
Intelligent anti-fan is one type of anti-fans. Intelligent anti-fans act as if they are the target's real fan and do wrong and bad behaviors as the fan. They intelligently create the target's bad image and gather more anti-fan.

Mountain pygmy possum

The mountain pygmy possum ("Burramys parvus") is a small, mouse-sized (weighs 45 g) nocturnal marsupial of Australia. It is found high up (1300 to 2230 metres) in rock screes and boulder fields of southern Victoria and in Kosciuszko National Park, New South Wales.
This possum is a Lazarus taxon, and the only living species in the Burramys genus. It is also the only Australian mammal restricted to an alpine habitat. Its prehensile tail, at ~14 cm, is longer than its 11 cm head and body length. Its diet consists of insects, fleshy fruits, nuts, nectar and seeds. 
The mountain pygmy possum was first described as a Pleistocene fossil by Robert Broom in 1896. It was thought to be extinct until 1966, when a living specimen was discovered in a ski-hut on Mount Hotham.
Three geographically isolated populations are known to exist. These populations have been shown to be genetically distinct. For most of the year, males and females live apart from each other. The females live on the better part of the rocky slopes, while the males live on the margins, usually lower on the mountain. In order to breed, the males migrate to the females' habitat. During the ski season on Mount Higginbotham, the males had to cross a road which put their survival in jeopardy. A "Tunnel of Love" was constructed under the road and a road sign was put in place to warn drivers.

Movie censorship

Censorship in movies is the act of giving a movie a very strong film rating systems classification, or banning the movie altogether.
The highest rating label in United Kingdom is 18. These means people under 18 cannot look at, buy or rent any movie under this rating. Movies with such a rating often have very strong language, explicit sexual content or heavy violence. If the content of the movie is higher than the 18 rating, the movie is then banned entirely.
Refused Classification is the very strongest rating in Australia. This rating means a movie has been banned from a part of Australia. In some cases, it has been banned in all of the country. This rating is tagged onto movies which the Australian Classification Board has said are too severe for viewing by general public.
The movie rating is NC-17 in the United States. This means No Children 17 and Under Admitted. Such movies contain strong sexual content, very strong violence or extremely graphic language and are usually considered too intense for an R rating.
The highest rating label in Canada is R. This means nobody under 18 may view, buy, rent, or watch any movie under this rating. Movie with this rating have strong sexual content/nudity, prolonged scenes of graphic violence, strong coarse language, graphic horror, and other disturbing content

Monsanto process

The Monsanto process is a way of making acetic acid. It uses a catalyst to add a carbonyl group to methanol. This process operates at a pressure of 30–60 atm and a temperature of 150–200 °C. It gives a selectivity greater than 99%. It was developed 1960 by German chemists working at BASF. Chemists at Monsanto introduced a new catalyst system in 1966. Today, chemists make acetic acid by the Cativa process, a similar iridium-based process developed by BP Chemicals Ltd which is more economical and environmentally friendly. So, the Monsanto process is not used very much in industry.
The process has several steps, which repeat to remake the catalyst:
The catalytically active species is the anion cis-[Rh(CO)I] (1). The catalytic cycle has been shown to involve six steps, two of which do not involve rhodium: conversion of methanol to methyl iodide and the hydrolysis of the acetyl iodide to acetic acid. (These steps are in the middle of the above diagram.) The first organometallic step is the oxidative addition of methyl iodide to "cis"-[Rh(CO)I] to form the hexacoordinate species [(CH)Rh(CO)I] (2). This anion rapidly transforms, by the migration of a methyl group to the carbonyl ligand, affording the pentacoordinate acetyl complex [(CHCO)Rh(CO)I] (3). This five-coordinate complex then reacts with carbon monoxide to form the six coordinate dicarbonyl complex. (4) This decomposes by reductive elimination to form acetyl iodide (CHCOI) and regenerate the active form of the catalyst. Acetyl iodide is then hydrolyzed to acetic acid.
The reaction mechanism is first-order with respect to methyl iodide and the catalyst (1). Hence the rate-determining step of the catalytic cycle has been proposed to be the oxidative addition of methyl iodide to the catalyst (1). Chemist think that this occurs with the rhodium center making a nucleophilic attack on the carbon of methyl iodide.
The Monsanto process for making acetic acid inspired chemists to invent a way to make Acetic anhydride. It is produced by carbonylation of methyl acetate.
In this process lithium iodide converts methyl acetate to lithium acetate and methyl iodide, which in turn affords through carbonylation acetyl iodide. Acetyl iodide reacts with acetate salts or acetic acid to give the product. Rhodium iodides and lithium salts are employed as catalysts. Because acetic anhydride is not stable in water, the conversion is conducted under water-free (anhydrous) conditions in contrast to the Monsanto acetic acid synthesis.

Heterochromia means "different colours", and is most used for the description of different coloured eyes. Some people, and animals, have differences between the irises of their eyes. There are many different causes for this condition.
Genetic causes for heterochromia include genetic mosaicism, where changes may take place in the dividing cells leading up to iris formation in the embryo. Or, environmental damage may occur to the eyes. Or, various diseases and medical conditions may result in changes in eye colour.
Similar events may happen in other tissues, and sometimes result in visible tissue differences. However, the condition is most easily seen in the iris of the eye. The terms "Hetrochromia iridis" (= different colour of the iris), "Heterochromia iridum" (plural form) and "Heterochromia iridium" (a mistake in Latin grammar) are variously used when it is the eye colour which is specifically mentioned.

Endogamy

Endogamy is the idea that a person ought to marry another person from the same group as them. The type of group is not always the same; it could be based on a religion, a class or a social group. Often group endogamy is enforced by arranged marriages, this is a system based on benefits for the group rather than marriage for love.
By marrying a person with the same group characteristics, it means that the partners will have similar views or beliefs about something. Many people marry endogamously for reasons of compatibility, which can be due to choice. But there are also other reasons when there is less choice involved or there is disapproval if it is not followed.
By doing this it keeps the numbers of a group to a minimum and thus creates stronger group bonds. For example, when moving to another country, a Sikh family may actively look for other Sikh families to mix with in order to facilitate Sikh marriages. By merging, they create a stronger bond between their own communities and can be a way to deal with being a minority.
If a group has been marrying endogamously for a long period of time the gene pool may be smaller and there is a greater chance of genetic disease. For example, within the Jewish community Tay-Sachs disease is a common genetic disease.

Exogamy

Exogamy is when a person ought to marry someone from outside a certain group.
In most places, exogamy is practiced in order to avoid incest, which is taboo in many groups across the world. This is to avoid some of the effects that endogamy creates such as genetic diseases. If two parents have very different genes then there is a lesser chance of a child inheriting both copies of that gene.
Exogamy is used to make a connection between two groups. For example, when a person marries another they become part of the family. This connection may be for reasons of inter-group cohesion. In other words, creating an alliance with another group.
Claude Levi-Strauss, an anthropologist, argued that when two families are connected by the marriage of two people it creates more relationships for trading other things such as food. It also means that they have more people to rely on. In order to keep this going, groups with trade sisters/daughters for wives and trade back in return.

Throw out the baby with the bath water

Throw out the baby with the bath water is an idiom.
The phrase describes a special kind of mistake which happens when something good is lost while trying to get rid of something bad.
The idiom summarizes what happens when something which is necessary is rejected along with what is not necessary.
A slightly different explanation focuses on the loss of the essential while holding on to what is not essential. In other words, the idiom also makes sense when someone might throw out the baby and keep the bath water. Idioms are a common stumbling block for learners of a language.
This idiom comes from a German proverb, "das Kind mit dem Bade ausschütten." In 1512, "Narrenbeschwörung" ("Appeal to Fools") by Thomas Murner includes a woodcut picture showing a woman tossing a baby out with waste water.
The meaning and intent are sometimes mirrored in different terms.

New Zealand has been in most Winter Olympic Games since 1952, missing only the 1956 and 1964 Games.
New Zealand athletes have won a total of 103 medals at the Summer Games. The most successful sport is athletics. New Zealand has only won a single medal at the Winter Games. The silver medal won by Annelise Coberger in alpine skiing at the 1992 Winter Olympics was the first medal won at the Winter Games by a Southern Hemisphere nation.
The New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC) is the National Olympic Committee for New Zealand. The NZOC was formed in 1911, and recognized by the IOC in 1919.
Being in the remote South Pacific, New Zealanders had to take long sea voyages to attend the early Olympics. It wasn’t until 1920 that New Zealand sent its first team. Before that three New Zealanders won medals for Australasian teams in 1908 and 1912.

Bearing (navigation)

In navigation, the word bearing is used for different methods that try to find out the angle between an object used for this purpose, and a reference direction. There are different systems of reference, that can be used for this. A system of reference that is commonly used is that of Cardinal directions, as they can be found with a compass. Very often, points that can easily be determined, and that move very little are taken as reference. Such points include stars, mountains, the sun, and beacons. Beacons come in the form of lighthouses on the coast, but also as electric beacons or other sea marks on the open sea. 
The bearing can be differentiated: Optical bearings rely on visual information, other systems rely on radar for example.

Roderick MacKinnon

Roderick MacKinnon (born 19 February 1956) is a professor of Molecular Neurobiology and Biophysics at Rockefeller University. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry together with Peter Agre in 2003 for his work on the structure and operation of ion channels.
MacKinnon was born in Burlington, Massachusetts and initially attended the University of Massachusetts Boston. MacKinnon then transferred to Brandeis University after one year, and there he received a bachelor's degree in biochemistry in 1978, studying calcium transport through the cell membrane for his honors thesis in Christopher Miller's laboratory. It was also at Brandeis where MacKinnon met his future wife and working-colleague Alice Lee.
After receiving his degree from Brandeis, MacKinnon entered medical school at Tufts University. He got his M.D. in 1982 and received training in Internal Medicine at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. He did not feel satisfied enough with the medical profession, so in 1986 he returned to Christopher Miller's laboratory at Brandeis for postdoctoral studies.
In 1989 he was appointed assistant professor at Harvard University where he studied the interaction of the potassium channel with a specific toxin taken from scorpion venom. He learned how to purify proteins and to use X-ray crystallography. In 1996, he moved to Rockefeller University as a professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology and Biophysics. There, he started to work on the structure of the potassium channel. These channels are of particular importance to the nervous system and the heart. The channels enable potassium ions to cross the cell membrane.
Potassium channels demonstrate a seemingly strange activity: they permit the passage of potassium ions, whereas they do not allow the passage of the much smaller sodium ions. Before MacKinnon's work, the detailed molecular architecture of potassium channels and the exact means by which they conduct ions remained speculative. In 1998, despite barriers to the structural study of integral membrane proteins that had stopped most attempts for decades, MacKinnon and colleagues determined the three-dimensional molecular structure of a potassium channel from bacteria utilizing X-ray crystallography. With this structure and other biochemical experiments, MacKinnon and colleagues were able to explain the exact mechanism by which potassium channel selectivity occurs.
His prize-winning research was conducted primarily at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) of Cornell University, and at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) of Brookhaven National Laboratory.

Gamophobia

Gamophobia (prounced 'ga-me-PHO-bia', from the Greek 'gamo' meaning 'marriage') is the fear of getting married, being in a relationship, or commitment. The opposite of 'gamophobia' is 'anuptaphobia'-it is the fear of not being in a relationship (to be single or alone). A person who has gamophobia may like or love a person, but when he or she finds out about that person liking them back and attempting to be together, there is a possibility that their would change to hate.
Rather than a phobia, such behavior is linked to a number of personality disorders and neuroses. The majority of phobias are socially created, and are not found in any DSM Psychology manual. The inability to allow oneself to be vulnerable and show their 'bad parts' has a personality disorder. When the individual displays reaction formation (love to hate) this is a neurotic defense mechanism.

Cluney Abbey is a Benedictine abbey in Cluny. It was built in Romanesque style and its three churches date rom the 10th to the 12th century. It was founded by William I of Aquitaine in the year 910. Soon the place was noted because it followed the Rule of St. Benedict more strictly than the place where the rule was developed, that is Subiaco in Italy. Cluny became the leader of a movement called monasticism. The abbey also started the Cluniac Reforms, and was subject only to the pope, Sergius III at the time. The Benedictine order was very important for the stability of f European society at the time.In 1790, during the French Revolution, the abbey was sacked, and mostly destroyed. Today, only very little of the original remains. 
Dating around 1334, the abbots of Cluny had a townhouse in Paris known as the Hôtel de Cluny, what is now a public museum since 1833. Apart from the name, it no longer possesses anything originally connected with Cluny.

Irish rebellion of 1798

The Irish rebellion of 1798 was an uprising of Irish people against British rule in Ireland. It was led by Wolfe Tone and consisted primarily of a secret society called the United Irish. It was aided by Republican France. However, it never gained much traction due to its alliance with anti-Catholic France, because Ireland was primarily Catholic. Despite the British government's anti-Catholicism, most Irish Catholics supported the Crown as the lesser of two evils because of the issue of Revolutionary France's involvement. The uprising lasted several months. A group called the United Irishmen were the main driving force in the rebellion. They were influenced by revolutions taking place in America and France around the time. The uprising is also known as United Irishmen Rebellion.
Between 10.000 and 50.000 people died as casualties on the Irish side, between 500 and 2000 on the English side.

<doc id="318219" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=318219" title="Volcanic winter">
Volcanic winter

A volcanic winter is a climate cooling caused by an extremely large volcanic eruption. Such an eruption releases ash and sulfur dioxide in huge quantities. They form aerosols of sulfuric acid. When they reach the stratosphere more sunlight is reflected, and some is absorbed by the stratosphere. These reactions heat up the stratosphere, but lead to a drop in the temperature on the ground. 
The Siberian Traps, Emeishan Traps, and Deccan Traps are huge flood basalt provinces caused by volcanism. They are the cause, or part of the cause, of several mass extinctions, especially the Permian–Triassic extinction event. 
Nuclear winter is a theory of similar effects which might be caused by a large-scale nuclear war.
The effects of recent volcanic eruptions on winters are modest in scale but historically their effects have been significant.
Most recently, the 1991 explosion of Mount Pinatubo, a stratovolcano in the Philippines, cooled global temperatures for about 2–3 years.
In 1883, the explosion of Krakatoa (Krakatau) created volcanic winter-like conditions. The next four years after the explosion were unusually cold, and the winter of 1887 to 1888 included powerful blizzards. Record snowfalls were recorded worldwide.
The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora, a stratovolcano in Indonesia, occasioned mid-summer frosts in New York State and June snowfalls in New England and Newfoundland and Labrador in what came to be known as the "Year without a Summer" of 1816.
A paper written by Benjamin Franklin in 1783 blamed the unusually cool summer of 1783 on volcanic dust coming from Iceland, where the eruption of Laki volcano had released enormous amounts of sulfur dioxide, resulting in the death of much of the island's livestock and a catastrophic famine which killed a quarter of the population. Temperatures in the northern hemisphere dropped by about 1 °C in the year following the Laki eruption.
In 1600, the Huaynaputina in Peru erupted. Tree ring studies show that 1601 was cold. Russia had its worst famine in 1601 to 1603. From 1600 to 1602, Switzerland, Latvia and Estonia had exceptionally cold winters. The wine harvest was late in 1601 in France, and in Peru and Germany wine production collapsed. Peach trees bloomed late in China, and Lake Suwa in Japan froze early.
In 1452 or 1453, a cataclysmic eruption of the submarine volcano named Kuwae. It caused worldwide disruptions.
The Great Famine of 1315–1317 in Europe may have been precipitated by a volcanic event, perhaps that of Kaharoa, New Zealand, which lasted about five years.

<doc id="318262" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=318262" title="Cosmic distance ladder">
Cosmic distance ladder

The cosmic distance ladder (also known as the extragalactic distance scale) is the way astronomers measure the distance of objects in space. No one method works for all objects and distances, so astronomers use a number of methods.
A real "direct" distance measurement of an astronomical object is possible only for those objects that are close enough to Earth (within about a thousand parsecs). It is the larger distances which are the problem. Several methods rely on a standard candle, which is an astronomical object that has a known standard luminosity.
The ladder analogy arises because no one technique can measure distances at all ranges encountered in astronomy. Instead, one method can be used to measure nearby distances, a second can be used to measure nearby to intermediate distances, and so on. Each rung of the ladder provides information that can be used to determine the distances at the next higher rung.
The astronomical unit is the mean (average) distance of the Earth from the Sun. This we know quite accurately. Radar bounce off artificial satellites and inner planets provide the data, then the result is worked out by computer. 
Parallax is the use of trigonometry to discover the distances of objects near to the solar system.
As the Earth orbits around the Sun, the position of nearby stars will appear to shift slightly against the more distant background. These shifts are angles in a right triangle, with 2 AU making the short leg of the triangle and the distance to the star being the long leg. The amount of shift is quite small, measuring 1 arcsecond for an object at a distance of 1 parsec (3.26 light-years)
This method works for distances up to a few hundred parsecs.
Objects of known brightness are called "standard candles". Most physical distance indicators are standard candles. These are objects which belong to a class that has a known brightness. By comparing the known luminosity of the latter to its observed brightness, the distance to the object can be computed using the inverse-square law. 
In astronomy, the brightness of an object is given in terms of its absolute magnitude. This quantity is derived from the logarithm of its luminosity as seen from a distance of 10 parsecs. The apparent magnitude is the magnitude as seen by the observer. It can be used to determine the distance "D" to the object in kiloparsecs (kiloparsec = 1,000 parsecs) as follows:
where "m" the apparent magnitude and "M" the absolute magnitude. For this to be accurate, both magnitudes must be in the same frequency band and there can be no relative motion in the radial direction.
Some means of accounting for interstellar extinction, which also makes objects appear fainter and more red, is also needed. The difference between absolute and apparent magnitudes is called the distance modulus, and astronomical distances, especially intergalactic ones, are sometimes tabulated in this way.
Two problems exist for any class of standard candle. The principal one is calibration, finding out exactly what the absolute magnitude of the candle is. 
The second lies in recognizing members of the class. The standard candle calibration does not work unless the object belongs to the class. At extreme distances, which is where one most wishes to use a distance indicator, this recognition problem can be quite serious.
A significant issue with standard candles is the question of how standard they are. For example, all observations seem to indicate that Type Ia supernovae that are of known distance have the same brightness. The possibility that the distant Type Ia supernovae have different properties than nearby Type Ia supernovae exists.
With few exceptions, distances based on direct measurements are available only up to about a thousand parsecs, which is a modest portion of our own Galaxy. For distances beyond that, measures depend upon physical assumptions, that is, the assertion that one recognizes the object in question, and the class of objects is homogeneous enough that its members can be used for meaningful estimation of distance.
Physical distance indicators, used on progressively larger distance scales, include:
In a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram the absolute magnitude for a group of stars is plotted against the spectral classification of the stars. Evolutionary patterns are found that relate to the mass, age and composition of the star. In particular, during their hydrogen burning period, stars lie along a curve in the diagram called the main sequence. 
By measuring the properties from a star's spectrum, the position of a main sequence star on the H-R diagram can be found. From this the star's absolute magnitude is estimated. A comparison of this value with the apparent magnitude allows the approximate distance to be determined, after correcting for interstellar extinction of the luminosity because of gas and dust.
In a gravitationally-bound star cluster such as the Hyades, the stars formed at approximately the same age and lie at the same distance. This allows relatively accurate main sequence fitting, providing both age and distance determination.
This is not a complete list of methods, but it does show the ways astronomers go about estimating the distance of astronomical objects.

The V-1 flying bomb (also called the Buzz Bomb or Doodlebug) was a World War II weapon. It was a flying bomb that used a jet engine to make it travel at 350 mph (600 kmph). The Luftwaffe people who controlled it pointed it at London, UK and Antwerp in Belgium. V-1s destroyed nearly as many houses as the Blitz did but killed fewer: 22,892 people died after being attacked by them. The Allies tried to stop these attacks by bombing their launching places, by shooting at them in the air, and by flying fast planes close to them and nudging them off course using their wings.
They had a fairly crude guidance system. Overall, only about 25 per cent of V-1s hit their targets. Most were lost lost by defensive measures, mechanical unreliability or guidance errors.

Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search

The Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search, or SWEEPS, was an astronomical survey. It was carried out in 2006. SWEEPS used the Hubble Space Telescope to look at 180,000 stars for seven days to find extrasolar planets.
The stars that SWEEPS monitored were all in the Sagittarius-I Window. This is a rare transparent look at the huge group of closely packed stars at the Milky Way's centre (central bulge), in the Sagittarius constellation. Our view to most of the stars in the centre of the galaxy is blocked by lanes of dust. These stars are about 27,000 light years from Earth.
Sixteen planets were discovered by SWEEPS. They took from 0.6 to 4.2 days to go around the Sun. Planets which took less than 1.2 days to go around the sun have not been detected yet; these have been called "ultra-short period planets" (USPPs) by the search team. USPPs were discovered only around stars with a low mass. This means that larger stars might have destroyed any planets orbiting so closely, or that planets could not move as far inward around larger stars.
SWEEPS-4 and SWEEPS-11 orbited stars that were very different to other stars close by. This made it possible for these to be looked at again using the radial velocity method. Their masses could then be found.

1925 Geneva Protocol

The Geneva Protocol of 1925 was a law that set made it illegal to fight with chemical or biological weapons in war. Before, it was signed by some countries like the United Kingdom and France originally. Any country who has signed this Protocol must follow it.
After World War I, the Geneva Protocol was made from the treaties signed with Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria.
After signing the treaty, some countries wanted to change it so that they would not have to follow it if the country fighting them did not follow the treaty. Because of this, many countries like France and United Kingdom withdrew from it. Others, like the United States still follow it but with this extra condition.

Fledge is the stage in a young bird's life when the feathers and wing muscles become developed enough for flight. It also describes the act of a chick's parents raising it until it is fully grown. A young bird that has recently fledged but still needs care and feeding is called a fledgling.
In ornithology, fledging has many meanings, depending on species. Birds are sometimes considered fledged once they leave the nest, even if they still cannot fly.

Rat snake

Rat snakes are medium to large snakes that can be found mostly in the northern hemisphere. They feed primarily on rodents and birds and, with some species being over 3 m (10 feet), they are on the top levels of some food chains. Many species make attractive pets and one, the corn snake, is one of the most popular reptile pets in the world. Other species can be very sensitive and sometimes aggressive, but the bites are not dangerous. Rat snakes were long thought to be completely nonvenomous, but recent studies have shown that some do have harmlessly small amounts of venom in them. When frightened, rat snakes may freeze, which is why a lot has been killed in traffic.
Rat snakes are commonly kept as pets. The corn snake especially is one of the most popular pet reptiles, and belongs to the rat snake family.

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a type of mass spectrometry that is highly sensitive. It can see a range of metals and several non-metals at concentrations below one part in 10 (part per trillion). It is based on hooking together an inductively coupled plasma as a method of producing ions (ionization) with a mass spectrometer as a method of separating and detecting the ions. Many chemists use Argon as a carrier gas to make the plasma. The machine sends the sample ions through a series of small cones. The cones let the plasma ions slowly enter the vacuum chamber of the mass spectrometer.
In trace elemental analysis, the method has advantages of high speed, precision and sensitivity compared to atomic absorption techniques. Analysis of lower concentrations at the same time is more prone to disruption by trace contaminants in labware and reagents used. Some analytes can not work with ICP-MS. Verification of analysis results requires additional work.
The variety of applications exceeds that of ICP-OES and includes isotopic speciation. Because ICP-MS can help make atom bombs, ICP-MS hardware is a subject for special exporting regulations.

4-H

4-H in the United States is a youth organization administered by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), with the mission of "engaging youth to reach their fullest potential while advancing the field of youth development." The name represents four personal development areas for the organization's members: head, heart, hands, and health. The organization has over 6.5 million members in the United States. Members are five to 19 years old, in approximately 90,000 clubs.
The goal of 4-H is to develop citizenship, leadership, responsibility and life skills of youth through experiential learning programs and a positive youth development approach. Many people think of 4-H as an agriculturally-focused organization as a result of its history. But 4-H today focuses on citizenship, healthy living, science, engineering, and technology programs.
Today, 4-H and related programs exist in over eighty countries around the world. The organization and administration varies from country to country. Each of these programs operates independently. They cooperate in international exchanges, global education programs, and communications.
The 4-H motto is "To make the best better", while its slogan is "Learn by doing" (sometimes written as "Learn to do by doing").
The start of 4-H began around 1900, with the work of several people in different parts of the United States. The focal point of 4-H has been the idea of practical and hands-on learning, which came from the desire to make public school education more connected to rural life. Early programs tied both public and private resources together to benefit rural youth.
During this time, researchers at agricultural experiment stations of the land-grant universities and USDA saw that adult farmers did not readily accept new agricultural discoveries, but educators found that youth would experiment with these new ideas and then share their experiences and successes with the adults. So, rural youth programs became a way to introduce new agriculture technology to the adults.
A. B. Graham started one of the youth programs in Clark County, Ohio, in 1902, which is considered the birth of the 4-H program in the United States. The first club was called "The Tomato Club" or the "Corn Growing Club". T.A. "Dad" Erickson of Douglas County, Minnesota, started local agricultural after-school clubs and fairs also in 1902. Jessie Field Shambaugh developed the clover pin with an H on each leaf in 1910, and, by 1912, they were called 4-H clubs. The national 4-H organization was formed in 1914. When the United States Congress created the Cooperative Extension Service (CES) of the USDA by passage of the Smith-Lever Act of 1914, it included within the CES charter the work of various boys' and girls' clubs involved with agriculture, home economics and related subjects. By 1924, these clubs became organized as 4-H clubs, and the clover emblem was adopted.
The first 4-H camp was held in Randolph County, West Virginia. Originally, these camps were for what was referred to as "Corn Clubs". Campers slept in corn fields, in tents, only to wake up and work almost the entirety of each day. Superintendent of schools G. C. Adams began a boys' corn club in Newton County, Georgia, in 1904. However, the city of Jacksboro, Texas, also stakes a claim to having the first forerunner to 4-H in 1910.
4-H membership hit an all-time high in 1974 as a result of its popular educational program about nutrition, "Mulligan Stew", shown in schools and on television across the country.

Emeishan Traps

The Emeishan Traps is a flood basalt volcanic province in Southwestern China, around Sichuan province. Many igneous rock types can be found there. This is known as large igneous province in geology. Other names for the traps include Permian Emeishan Large Igneous Province, and other variations. The Traps are the step-like rock made up of many layers of basalt, which were laid down by successive eruptions of magma. 
The eruptions that lead to the Emeshian traps began about 260 million years ago. The traps are much smaller than the Siberian Traps, which occurred not long afterwards, about 251 million years ago. Despite this, the Emeshian traps were large enough to have an impact on the ecology of the time, and on paleontology. They are part of the mass extinction events towards the end of the Permian period.
The Emeishan Traps are part of the scientific debate on the causes of mass extictions. The end-Guadalupian extinction occurred at almost the same time as the Emeshian Traps were formed. This supports the argument, that volcanism is the main driving force behind mass extinctions. Another theory that has been proposed to explain mass extinctions is that meteor or comet impact events caused them. In this context, the hypothesis is that impact events cause flood basalt eruptions, such as those which generated the Emeshian Traps. This hypothesis is not widely supported.

Mucous membrane

The mucous membranes (or mucosae; singular mucosa) are skin-like linings. They are covered in epithelium. They do secretion, and in the alimentary canal they also do absorption. They line cavities that are exposed to the external environment and internal organs. 
At several places they connect up (are contiguous) with the skin. For example, at the nostrils, the mouth, the lips, the eyelids, the ears, the genital area, and the anus. Unlike skin (which has hair growing out of it), mucous membranes are hairless.
The sticky, thick fluid secreted by the mucous membranes and glands is called "mucous". The term "mucous membrane" refers to where they are found in the body. However, not every mucous membrane secretes mucous.

Knob and tube wiring

Knob and tube wiring (abbreviated K&T) was an early type of electrical wiring. It was commonly used from the 1880s to the early 1940s, and is occasionally, but very rarely, still used today. In knob and tube wiring, wires were held to the wooden structure by ceramic "knobs", and were protected by ceramic "tubes" when they went through a piece of wood. Wires were held to the knobs by another piece of non-conducting wire. A material called loom protected the wire when it entered a junction box, which usually contained an outlet, switch, or light fixture. Splices were soldered together and wrapped in cloth electrical tape. The insulation on knob and tube wiring was usually cotton cloth soaked in asphalt. To prevent short circuits, the hot and neutral wires were kept far apart. This is not necessary on modern wiring because modern insulation alone is enough to prevent short circuits. Knob and tube wiring did not have a ground wire and therefore did not have three-prong outlets. Most electrical codes allow the use of a GFCI to update knob and tube outlets to three-prong without installing any new wire.
Knob and tube wiring used cloth insulation. Over time this insulation can wear out, become brittle, and fall off, leaving bare wire. The ceramic knobs and tubes provide some protection because even if the insulation does fall off, the bare wire can not touch the wooden structure. The insulation is also somewhat flammable. Some knob and tube insulation contained asbestos, which reduced the risk of fire, but can cause cancer. Unlike modern wiring, splices were not contained in a protective box. If a splice failed, it could make a spark and start a fire. The fuse boxes usually had no protection from using an incorrect fuse. An incorrect fuse could cause the wiring to overheat and become damaged or start a fire. Another problem is that when a fuse blew, people who didn't know or didn't care about the hazards would sometimes replace it with a coin or a ball of foil if a replacement fuse wasn't available, leaving no overload protection at all. These issues can be partially corrected by installing a modern circuit breaker panel with arc fault circuit interrupter breakers. There was also no ground wire. Knob and tube can be updated with a GFCI to add the equivalent of grounding. There is generally no need to replace knob and tube wiring if it is in good condition.
Unlike modern wiring, knob and tube supply and return wires were not always alongside each other. In the oldest installations, several branch circuits could share the same neutral wire, which can cause overloads. To prevent overloads in this layout, the neutral wires were protected with fuses. If a neutral fuse blew or was removed, it could create a dangerous condition where the power appeared to be off, but was in fact still present. Three-way switches could also be wired in such a way that the outer ring of a lamp socket, which is normally connected to neutral, could be connected to hot, which is an electric shock hazard.

<doc id="318375" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=318375" title="Post-postmodernism">
Post-postmodernism

Post-Postmodernism is a general term used to describe new developments emerging from Postmodernism. It is a positive idea that faith, sincerity and trust can be better for society Postmodern irony. Postmodernism is a way of thinking about culture and thought. It often challenges the certainty and authority of vital areas of our lives. However, as an almost sixty year-old term many do not think it is relevant to how we live our lives now and suggest a positive, earnest look at the world we live in. The term Post-Postmodernism was initially coined by seminal cultural theorist Alice Sanders in her magnum opus 'The Shadow of the Rainbow'.
Modernism began in the late 19th Century as a rejection of tradition and an attempt to see the world differently. It is associated with the Enlightenment. Events such as World War 2 and the Great Depression made many feel Modernism had failed. This led to Postmodernism, which is cold and skeptical of the grand narrative of Western Society. This grand narrative is explained by Jean-François Lyotard as something. Postmodernism is a very broad term that cannot be defined by specific themes. It is an all-encompassing way of thinking.
Postmodernism is seen as a theory for explaining 20th Century culture. With the 20th Century now behind us and a new century beginning, many have suggested that Postmodernism is outdated in our current world. Advances such as the Internet, Mobile Phones and Television have changed the way we live, making the world a smaller place but also making communication and interaction with things around us less intimate. Post-Postmodernism takes this as a key reason why a return to sincerity and authentic expression is the way forward for the 21st Century.
Post-Postmodernism is a very new idea that is still forming. There are many different ideas about how Post-Postmodernism could evolve and shape culture.
Zygmunt Bauman uses the term Liquid Modernity to refer to the freedom of ideas, information and people. It draws upon the global nature of society. Distinct cultures, ideas and categories are meeting and fusing in the 21st Century. It has been called "a world of fragmented and incommensurate identities and personae". Liquid Modernity is a powerful reaction to Postmodernism as it states that through privitisation and the global economy, we are now free to determine our own existence and path in the world.
In 2010 Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin Van Den Akker wrote an article called 'Notes on Metamodernism' that characterised life today as an oscillation between the realism of Postmodernism and the idealism of Modernism. They believe the two can work together, and that modern culture is based on navigating these oppositions. They list as opposing forces that a big variety of artists, theorists and creatives constantly alternate between.
Jesse Thorn's public radio show The Sound of Young America put forward the phrase 'New Sincerity'. Thorn says that some people and things in modern life are so entertaining and genuine that they can only be enjoyed sincerely, without irony. Using Evel Knievel as an example, he says: "Here is a real man who feels at home as Spidey on the cover of a comic book. Simply put, Evel Knievel boggles the mind." New Sincerity is a popular culture movement that shares many ideas with post-postmodernism.
German-American Slavist Raoul Eshelman wrote in his book "Performatism, Or the End of Postmodernism" that many new cultural documents present viewers with simple, identifiable characteristics that are powerful. By making us aware of the artificial and set conditions of a piece of work, he believes we can have a genuine, sincere experience. His main example is the film American Beauty.
As an art movement, Altermodernism is a reaction to what Nicolas Bourriaud calls 'the standardisation of culture'. It was first discussed at the Altermodern Tate Triennial. In his manifesto Bourriaud says that "Increased communication, travel and migration are affecting the way we live". He calls contemporary existence "a cultural landscape saturated with signs". This means that we are overloaded with information and overlapping of cultures and ways of living. Bourriaud believes art is a way to create new pathways and find meaning in modern society.

Exercise physiology is the study of the acute responses and chronic adaptations to a wide-range of physical exercise conditions. In addition, many exercise physiologists study the effect of exercise on pathology, and the mechanisms by which exercise can reduce or reverse disease progression. Professional bodies in most developed countries review and approve education programs to ensuring the quality and consistency of education.
An exercise physiologist's area of study may include but is not limited to biochemistry, bioenergetics, cardiopulmonary function, hematology, biomechanics, skeletal muscle physiology, neuroendocrine function, and central and perpheral nervous system function. Also, exercise physiologists range from basic scientists, to clinical researchers, to clinicians, to sports trainers.

Short circuit

A short circuit is a problem in an electrical circuit where two or more wires that are not supposed to come in contact with each other touch. A short circuit can result in a very high current flowing through the circuit. This high current can destroy components, melt insulation and start a fire. If there is enough voltage, it can also cause an explosion called arc flash. Circuit breakers and fuses are devices that detect short circuits and (usually) shut the power off before any damage can be done.
A "short circuit" also happens when there is a bypass of electrical current. As electricity is "lazy", when there is a bypass without a "load"(e.g.bulb), it prefers to travel that route.

<doc id="318395" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=318395" title="Circuit breaker">
Circuit breaker

A circuit breaker is a device designed to shut off an electrical circuit when too much current is flowing. This usually occurs if too many devices are plugged in or if there is a short circuit. Circuit breakers are usually installed in the electrical panel. Some circuit breakers also have GFCI protection. Inside the circuit breaker, there is usually an electromagnetic coil. When too much current flows through the coil, it pulls on the switch, shutting the power off. The coil reacts to immediate short circuits. There is also a bimetal strip that will bend and pull on the switch if it gets too hot. This reacts to extended periods of too much current. 
Some advanced circuit breakers monitor current electronically, and shut the power off when an electronic sensor detects too much current. A circuit breaker does the same job as a fuse, but unlike a fuse, a circuit breaker does not need to be replaced to be reset, except in some severe cases such as very high-current short circuits and lightning strikes that may damage the circuit breaker.

The Merchant of Venice is a play written by William Shakespeare. The date the play was written in unknown, but the play was mentioned in 1598 in Francis Mere's "Wit's Treasury". A date of 1596-1597 is now accepted. Shakespeare's source was "Il Pecorone" by Ser Giovanni, a 14th century Florentine writer.
"The Merchant of Venice" was first published in 1600. It was published again in 1619, and then in 1623 in the First Folio, a collection of all of Shakespeare's plays. The play has been made into television programs many times and also into some movies. Three operas are based on the play.
Bassanio is an aristocratic but poor young man of Venice. He has fallen in love with Portia, a beautiful young lady of Belmont. Bassanio needs money to woo the lady. He asks his friend Antonio, the merchant of Venice, for a loan. 
Antonio's money is tied-up in business ventures. Antonio borrows money from a Jewish moneylender named Shylock. Antonio signs a bond agreeing to give Shylock a pound of his flesh if the money is not repaid on a certain date. Bassanio uses the money travel to Belmont. He wins Portia's love.
Antonio cannot repay the borrowed money on time. Shylock insists on the pound of flesh as stated in the bond. The case goes to court. Portia disguises herself as a lawyer. She says that Shylock's bond is cruel. His insistence on the terms of the bond is just, but justice must be softened with mercy. Shylock will not relent. The court forces him to release Antonio.
